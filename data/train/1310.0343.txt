    "brieskorn varieties are affine varieties of the form @xmath0 and are a natural generalization of fermat varieties . they became popular after it was observed by hirzebruch that links of singular brieskorn varieties at @xmath1 , meaning sets of the form @xmath2 can sometimes be homeomorphic , but not diffeomorphic to spheres .",
    "some essential ingredients for the necessary computations were worked out by pham , @xcite , and a rather complete picture was worked out by brieskorn , @xcite .",
    "the above links @xmath3 are now known as brieskorn manifolds .    in contact geometry ,",
    "brieskorn manifolds were first recognized as contact manifolds by abe - erbacher , lutz - meckert and sasaki - hsu around 1975 - 1976 , @xcite . in particular , their work showed that at least some exotic spheres admit contact structures . around the same time , thomas @xcite also used brieskorn manifolds to establish existence results for contact structures on simply - connected @xmath4-manifolds .",
    "with hindsight , the role of brieskorn manifolds in early constructions of contact @xmath4-manifolds can be clarified ; a classification result for simply - connected @xmath4-manifolds by smale , @xcite , combined with a homology computation , see section  [ sec : homology_brieskorn ] , shows that every simply - connected spin @xmath4-manifold is actually the connected sum of brieskorn manifolds .",
    "since brieskorn manifolds also include many spheres with the standard smooth structure , these manifolds can be used to show that there are non - standard contact structures on @xmath5 following eliashberg , @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient is a result of eliashberg - gromov - mcduff stating that aspherical symplectic fillings for the standard contact sphere @xmath6 are diffeomorphic to @xmath7 .",
    "smooth brieskorn varieties , natural symplectic fillings for brieskorn manifolds , are symplectically aspherical , but typically have a lot of homology .",
    "hence the contact structure on the boundary , a brieskorn manifold , is non - standard provided none of the exponents equals @xmath8 .",
    "later on , ustilovsky , @xcite , showed that there are infinitely many non - isomorphic contact structures on @xmath9 with the same formal homotopy class of almost contact structures as the standard contact sphere .",
    "because brieskorn manifolds have a rich and rather understandable structure , they are still of interest , and in this note we will highlight some of their more recent applications to contact and symplectic topology , including some new results on orderability and exotic contact structures .      in this survey , we will start by describing classical results concerning homology and exotic spheres , and apply these results to obtain some symplectic invariants of brieskorn varieties , namely symplectic homology .",
    "these invariants are in some cases invariants of the contact structure on the boundary , the brieskorn manifold , and we will use this to describe a multitude of exotic contact structures on various kinds of manifolds .    to state the first result , we recall that symplectic homology , denoted by @xmath10 , is a floer type invariant of symplectic manifolds with contact type boundary .",
    "there are various versions of symplectic homology , including equivariant symplectic homology , denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the symplectic manifolds we will consider will be so - called liouville domains with vanishing first chern class .",
    "this means that there is an exact symplectic form and symplectic homology can be equipped with an integer grading .",
    "we will briefly review symplectic homology in section  [ sec : blackbox_sh ] .",
    "the mean euler characteristic of the @xmath12-part of equivariant symplectic homology of a liouville domain @xmath13 is then @xmath14 this limit is not always defined , and contains less information than the homology itself . also , by definition the mean euler characteristic depends on the liouville filling , and not only on the contact type boundary . in lemma",
    "[ lemma : mec_invariant ] we will give sufficient conditions on the contact manifold that guarantee that the mean euler characteristic is an invariant of the contact structure on the boundary .",
    "the precise conditions , which we will refer to as a contact manifold with _ convenient dynamics _ , are somewhat technical . as a particular case , we point out that a contact form with a periodic reeb flow for which the mean index is non - zero is an example of a contact manifold with convenient dynamics .    in view of this , consider @xmath15 , the monoid of contact structures on @xmath16 that are convex fillable by simply - connected liouville manifolds with vanishing first chern class and that admit convenient dynamics . the ( boundary ) connected sum is the monoid operation . then    given any rational number @xmath17 ,",
    "there is a stein fillable contact structure @xmath18 on @xmath16 whose mean euler characteristic equals @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the map @xmath20 is a surjective monoid homomorphism .",
    "this theorem is proved by computing this invariant for brieskorn manifolds and applying a simple connected sum formula .",
    "we have several other results about exotic contact structures and invariants , but due to their more technical nature we will refer to sections  [ sec : examples ] ,  [ sec : mec ] ,  [ sec : mec_brieskorn ] and [ sec : not_full_invariants ] for their statements .",
    "we also investigate an invariant of the filling , namely symplectic homology .",
    "let @xmath21 be a brieskorn manifold with filling @xmath22 , and suppose that none of the exponents @xmath23 equals @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath24 does not vanish .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 is orderable .",
    "non - vanishing of symplectic homology follows from the fact that the milnor number is positive .",
    "this guarantees the existence of lagrangian spheres which in turn imply non - vanishing of symplectic homology .",
    "in particular , the same holds true for links of _ isolated singularities _ with positive milnor number , see theorem  [ thm : sh_isolated_sing ] . the last statement on orderability is related to non - vanishing of symplectic homology and depends on recent work due to albers and merry , @xcite , see theorem  [ thm : orderable_albers_merry ] for a more precise formulation .",
    "we remind the reader that the standard contact sphere , which is realized by any brieskorn manifold for which at least one of the @xmath23 s equal to @xmath8 , is not orderable .",
    "in fact , the filling of @xmath25 by the brieskorn variety @xmath26 , is the filling by a ball , which has vanishing symplectic homology .",
    "interestingly , the brieskorn manifolds satisfying the above conditions , include contact manifolds that are diffeomorphic to spheres in dimension greater than @xmath27 , so we obtain    for @xmath28 , there are infinitely many non - contactomorphic contact structures on @xmath5 that are orderable .",
    "we also give explicit examples where equivariant symplectic homology with @xmath29-coefficients can not distinguish certain contact structures on @xmath30 .",
    "this is the family of brieskorn manifolds @xmath31 , where we may regard @xmath32 as a subcritically fillable structure on @xmath30 ( this notation is explained in sections  [ sec : contact_open_book ] and [ sec : monodromy_brieskorn ] ) .",
    "to distinguish two of them , we use the fact that @xmath31 for @xmath33 does not embed into a subcritical stein manifold .    on @xmath30 , there are stein - fillable contact structures @xmath34 and @xmath35 that are not contactomorphic . however ,",
    "the cylindrical contact homology / equivariant symplectic homology groups with @xmath29-coefficients of these contact structures are isomorphic .    for non - simply - connected contact manifolds , a related , and much stronger result",
    "is already known , namely that there are contact manifolds that are not even diffeomorphic , yet with symplectomorphic symplectizations , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath36 be a holomorphic function with an isolated singularity at @xmath1 .",
    "define the singular variety @xmath37 .",
    "the * link * of the isolated singularity is defined as @xmath38 put differently , if we define the function @xmath39 on @xmath40 by putting @xmath41 , then @xmath42 is the level set @xmath43 . as @xmath1 is an isolated singularity on @xmath44 , we find a small regular value @xmath45 of @xmath46 and we see that the link is a smooth manifold .",

    ". we will always work with contact structures that are globally defined as the kernel of a smooth @xmath8-form @xmath50 , a so - called * contact form*. the condition that @xmath51 is maximally non - integrable is then equivalent to @xmath52 . by a * contactomorphism * between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we mean a diffeomorphism @xmath55 with the property @xmath56 .",
    "a basic theorem tells us that deformations of contact structures on a compact manifold are always contactomorphic . more precisely .",
    "let @xmath57 , @xmath58 $ ] be a smooth family of contact structures on a closed manifold @xmath48 .",
    "then there is an isotopy @xmath59 of @xmath48 such that @xmath60.\\ ] ] in particular , @xmath61 is contactomorphic to @xmath62 .",
    "the simplest way to define a contact structure on a link of a singularity is to observe that , away from @xmath1 , @xmath46 defines a strictly plurisubharmonic function on the variety @xmath44 . here",
    "we call a function @xmath39 * strictly plurisubharmonic * if @xmath63 defines a riemannian metric on @xmath64 .",
    "the link is a regular level set of this function , namely @xmath65 , so this link carries a contact structure . to see this ,",

    "then @xmath67 is a contact form with contact structure @xmath68 . put differently , the contact planes are the complex tangencies to the link @xmath42 , so @xmath69",
    ".    links of holomorphic functions are examples of particularly nice contact manifolds .",
    "they are symplectically fillable . to make this precise",
    ", we will recall three different forms of fillings .",
    "a * liouville domain * , or * compact liouville manifold * , is a compact , exact symplectic manifold @xmath70 with boundary and a globally defined liouville vector field @xmath71 , defined by @xmath72 , such that @xmath71 points outward along the boundary of @xmath73 .",
    "a * weinstein domain * @xmath70 is a liouville domain for which the corresponding liouville vector field is gradient - like for some morse function @xmath74 .    a * stein domain * is a compact , complex manifold with a strictly plurisubharmonic function @xmath39 such that its boundary is a regular level set of @xmath39 .    by the above construction with plurisubharmonic functions the boundary of a stein domain",
    "is a contact manifold .",
    "we call the resulting contact manifold stein fillable .    in fact ,",
    "all of the above domains carry a contact structure on the boundary : in the two remaining cases we simply insert the liouville vector field in the symplectic form @xmath75 obtaining a liouville form @xmath76 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath76 to the boundary is a contact form .",
    "we call the resulting contact manifolds liouville or weinstein fillable depending on the type of the domain .",
    "one can show that a stein domain is always a weinstein domain .",
    "a liouville domain is the weakest of these three forms of fillability , and by a theorem of eliashberg one can deform a weinstein domain into a stein domain .",
    "the monograph @xcite explains this in detail .",
    "links of holomorphic functions as defined above , are always stein fillable . indeed , consider the variety @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath78 is sufficiently small , the perturbed link @xmath79 carries a contact structure that is isomorphic to the one constructed earlier by gray stability .      a particularly nice class of links of singularities is formed by weighted homogeneous polynomials .",
    "a function @xmath80 is called * weighted homogeneous * with weights @xmath81 , which are all assumed to be positive integers , if for all @xmath82 we have @xmath83 .    usually , the weights are normalized by requiring @xmath84 .",
    "note that the singular variety @xmath44 carries a @xmath85-action : @xmath86    links of weighted homogeneous polynomials carry a natural contact structure by the above argument .",
    "the contact form provided by this argument is not the best one though , and the one provided by the following proposition provides more insight into the structure .    [ prop : bw_contact_form ] assume that @xmath87 is a weighted homogeneous polynomial with an isolated singularity at @xmath1 .",
    "then the manifold @xmath42 carries the contact form @xmath88 whose reeb flow is periodic , @xmath89 furthermore , the contact manifolds @xmath90 and @xmath91 are contactomorphic .",
    "the proof is essentially backwards , since we start by guessing the contact form and reeb field , and reconstruct the liouville vector field from there . once one obtains the liouville vector field , the contact and reeb conditions are easily checked .",
    "define a symplectic form on @xmath40 by @xmath92 .",
    "a primitive is given by the @xmath8-form @xmath93 .",
    "we shall show that @xmath50 restricts to a contact form on the link of @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath94 denote the vector field generating the @xmath95-action induced by the @xmath85-action on @xmath44 , so @xmath96 this vector field is going to be the reeb vector field , but this is not clear at the moment .",
    "we claim that @xmath94 is tangent to @xmath42 . to see this observe that @xmath94 lies in @xmath97 ( and in the kernel @xmath98 ) as well as in the kernel of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 now define the vector field @xmath71 by the linear equation @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath102 , it follows that @xmath71 is liouville on @xmath44 .",
    "we claim that @xmath71 is transverse to @xmath42 . to see why , note first of all that @xmath103 , so we only need to check that @xmath71 is transverse to level sets of @xmath39 on @xmath44 . since @xmath104",
    "we have @xmath105 . on the other hand , if @xmath106 , then @xmath107 as a short computation shows .",
    "it follows that @xmath71 is a liouville vector field that is transverse to @xmath42 .",
    "hence @xmath108 is a contact form after restricting to a regular level set of @xmath39 .",
    "it is now also clear that @xmath94 is the reeb vector field for @xmath50 , since @xmath109 .",
    "on @xmath42 , we also have @xmath110 .",
    "finally , the flow of @xmath94 is given by the above formula .",
    "we now come to the claim that the contact forms @xmath50 and @xmath111 have contactomorphic contact structures .",
    "the main ingredient is the gray stability theorem .",
    "first of all , we may assume that @xmath112 for all @xmath113 by rescaling @xmath50 . then define a family of almost complex structures @xmath114",
    ", @xmath115 $ ] , on @xmath116 by @xmath117 where @xmath118 s are nonzero real numbers satisfying @xmath119 , @xmath120 for all @xmath113 . such choice of real number @xmath121 can be made because of the assumption @xmath112 . by a direct computation",
    "we see that the function @xmath122 is strictly plurisubharmonic with respect to @xmath114 for all @xmath123 and hence we obtain a family of contact forms @xmath124 on @xmath42 with @xmath125 and @xmath126 with @xmath75 above .",
    "we claim that @xmath111 is isotopic to @xmath127 which completes the proof .",
    "note that the equation @xmath128 defines a liouville vector field @xmath129 on @xmath130 and it is positively transverse to @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath131 .",
    "as @xmath71 is also a liouville vector field for @xmath75 that is positively transverse to @xmath42 , their convex sum @xmath132 , @xmath58 $ ] , gives a family of liouville vector field positively transverse to @xmath42 .",
    "the family of contact forms @xmath133 gives the desired isotopy , so gray stability gives the conclusion .",
    "the advantage of the above contact form is that the reeb flow is periodic , so we get a locally free circle action on the link @xmath42 .",
    "if the defining polynomial @xmath87 is homogeneous , then the resulting action is free , and the quotient of @xmath134 carries the structure of a symplectic manifold . in general , the action has non - trivial , but finite isotropy and the quotient @xmath134 will be a symplectic orbifold .",
    "links of weighted homogeneous polynomials are prequantization bundles over symplectic orbifolds . if the defining polynomial is homogeneous , then @xmath42 is a prequantization bundle over a symplectic manifold .",
    "let us say more precisely which symplectic orbifold or manifold we get .",
    "the link @xmath42 lies inside a sphere @xmath135 .",
    "the circle action induced by the reeb flow on @xmath42 extends to the sphere , and the quotient is a weighted projective space @xmath136 .",
    "the quotient of the link @xmath42 is a hypersurface in weighted projective space , given by the zeroset of the polynomial @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , we see that the quotient is a khler orbifold . on the other hand",
    ", we have an explicit nice model for the symplectization as well , namely by removing @xmath1 from the variety @xmath44 , so the symplectization is also a khler manifold . contact manifolds with this property",
    "are called * sasaki * , and form an area of research by themselves , @xcite .",
    "we will not pursue this line of thought , though .",
    "we now consider an even more special class of singularities , namely weighted homogeneous polynomials of the form @xmath137 where @xmath138 are positive integers .",
    "we will call these polynomials * brieskorn - pham * or just * brieskorn * polynomials .",
    "if the exponents satisfy @xmath139 for all @xmath140 , then a brieskorn polynomial has an isolated singularity at @xmath1 , so its link is a contact manifold .",
    "if one of the exponents @xmath23 of the brieskorn polynomial equals @xmath8 , then we are looking at the link of a smooth point , which is the standard contact sphere .",
    "the link of a brieskorn polynomial is called a * brieskorn manifold*.    since we will also look the variety @xmath141 and deformations , it is useful to reserve the word * brieskorn variety * for sets of the form @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a ( small ) deformation parameter . for @xmath144 ,",
    "this variety is non - singular . if all exponents @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , then we obtain the singular variety @xmath147 with an isolated singularity at @xmath1 .    instead of taking the usual contact form on a link induced by the plurisubharmonic function @xmath148 , we will use proposition  [ prop : bw_contact_form ] to obtain a nicer contact form . indeed ,",
    "brieskorn polynomials are weighted homogeneous with weights @xmath149 .",
    "for later convenience , we rescale the contact form from proposition  [ prop : bw_contact_form ] and always take the contact form @xmath150 as mentioned before , the reeb flow of this contact form is periodic , and this makes brieskorn manifolds tractable .    to simplify notation",
    ", we will often write @xmath151",
    "as a starter , we point out that brieskorn manifolds in dimension @xmath8 are links in the sense of knot theory .",
    "in fact , @xmath152 is a torus link with @xmath153 components .",
    "if @xmath154 and @xmath155 are relatively prime , then @xmath152 is an @xmath156 torus knot .",
