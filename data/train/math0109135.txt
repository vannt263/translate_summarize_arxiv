    "the problem of determining whether a balanced presentation of a group is geometric ( i.e. induced by a heegaard diagram of a closed orientable 3-manifold ) is of considerable interest in geometric topology and has already been examined by many authors ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the connections between cyclic coverings of @xmath2 branched over knots and cyclic presentations of groups induced by suitable heegaard diagrams have recently been discussed in several papers ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "note that a finite balanced presentation of a group @xmath3 is said to be a _",
    "cyclic presentation _ if there exists a word @xmath4 in the free group @xmath5 generated by @xmath6 such that the relators of the presentation are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the automorphism defined by @xmath10 ( mod @xmath1 ) , @xmath11 .",
    "this cyclic presentation ( and the related group ) will be denoted by @xmath12 . for further details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we list the most interesting examples :    * the fibonacci group @xmath13 is the fundamental group of the @xmath1-fold cyclic covering of @xmath2 branched over the figure - eight knot , for all @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) ; * the sieradsky group @xmath15 is the fundamental group of the @xmath1-fold cyclic covering of @xmath2 branched over the trefoil knot , for all @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) ; * the fractional fibonacci group @xmath16 is the fundamental group of the @xmath1-fold cyclic covering of @xmath2 branched over the genus one two - bridge knot with conway coefficients @xmath17 $ ] , for all @xmath14 and @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , all the above cyclic presentations are geometric ( i.e. , they arise from suitable heegaard diagrams ) .    in order to investigate these relations , dunwoody introduced in @xcite a class of heegaard diagrams depending on six integers , having cyclic symmetry and defining cyclic presentations for the fundamental group of the represented manifolds . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the 3-manifolds represented by these diagrams are cyclic coverings of lens spaces , branched over @xmath0-knots ( also called genus one 1-bridge knots ) . as a corollary",
    ", it has been proved that for some determined cases the manifolds turn out to be cyclic coverings of @xmath2 , branched over suitable knots .",
    "this gives a positive answer to a conjecture formulated by dunwoody in @xcite .",
    "section 2 resumes the main statements of @xcite concerning this topic .",
    "the above results suggest that cyclic presentations of groups are actually related to cyclic branched coverings of @xmath0-knots . as a basic result in this direction ,",
    "we prove in section 3 that every @xmath1-fold strongly - cyclic branched covering of a @xmath0-knot admits a heegaard diagram of genus @xmath19 which encodes a cyclic presentation for the fundamental group .",
    "the definition of strongly - cyclic branched coverings of @xmath0-knots will be introduced in section 3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the construction used to prove our main result is strictly related to the concept of @xmath20-symmetric heegaard splittings introduced by birman and hilden in @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we shall deal with @xmath0-knots , i.e. knots in lens spaces ( possibly in @xmath2 ) , which admit a certain decomposition .",
    "a knot @xmath21 in a lens space @xmath22 is called a @xmath0-_knot _ ( or also a _ genus one 1-bridge knot _ ) if there exists a heegaard splitting of genus one @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are solid tori , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are properly embedded trivial arcs , and @xmath28 is the attaching homeomorphism .",
    "this means that there exists a disk @xmath29 ( resp .",
    "@xmath30 ) with @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( resp . @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "-knot decomposition .",
    "]    notice that @xmath0-knots are only a particular case of the notion of @xmath35-links in closed orientable 3-manifolds ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , which generalize the classical concept of bridge decomposition of links in @xmath2 .",
    "the class of @xmath0-knots has recently been investigated in several papers ( see @xcite ) and appears very important in the light of some results and conjectures involving dehn surgery on knots .",
    "it is well known that the subclass of @xmath0-knots in @xmath2 contains all torus knots ( trivially ) and all 2-bridge knots ( i.e. , @xmath36-knots ) @xcite .",
    "dunwoody introduced in @xcite a class of heegaard diagrams having a cyclic symmetry , depending on six integers @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this construction gives rise to a wide class of closed orientable 3-manifolds @xmath41 , called _",
    "dunwoody manifolds _ , admitting geometric cyclic presentations for their fundamental groups .",
    "the diagram is an heegaard diagram of genus @xmath1 .",
    "it contains @xmath1 upper cycles @xmath42 and @xmath1 lower cycles @xmath43 , each having @xmath44 vertices . for each @xmath11 , the cycle @xmath45 ( resp .",
    "@xmath46 ) is connected to the cycle @xmath47 ( resp .",
    "@xmath48 ) by @xmath49 parallel arcs , to the cycle @xmath50 by @xmath51 parallel arcs and to the cycle @xmath48 by @xmath52 parallel arcs . the cycle @xmath45 is glued to the cycle @xmath53 ( mod @xmath1 ) so that equally labelled vertices are identified together ( the labelling of the cycles is pointed out in figure 3 ) .",
    "it is evident that the diagram ( as well as the identification rule ) is invariant with respect to a cyclic action of order @xmath1 .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that each dunwoody manifold is a cyclic covering of a lens space ( possibly @xmath2 ) , branched over a @xmath0-knot .",
    "[ theorem 3 ] @xcite the dunwoody manifold @xmath41 is the @xmath1-fold cyclic covering of a lens space @xmath54 ( possibly @xmath2 ) branched over a @xmath0-knot @xmath55 , both only depending on the integers @xmath56 .    as a consequence , for certain particular values of the parameters a dunwoody manifold",
    "turn out to be a cyclic covering of @xmath2 branched over a knot .",
    "this gives a positive answer to a conjecture formulated by dunwoody in @xcite , which has also been independently proved in @xcite .",
    "[ corollary 4 ] @xcite each dunwoody manifold @xmath41 of section 3 of @xcite is an @xmath1-fold cyclic covering of @xmath57 , branched over a @xmath0-knot @xmath58 , which only depends on @xmath56 .",
    "as well known , an @xmath1-fold cyclic branched covering between two orientable closed manifolds @xmath59 , with branching set @xmath60 , is completely defined by an epimorphism @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the cyclic group of order @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath63 and the branching set is a knot @xmath21 , the covering is uniquely determined , up to covering equivalence , since @xmath64 and the homology class @xmath65 $ ] of a meridian loop around the knot have to be mapped by @xmath66 in a generator of @xmath62 .",
    "therefore the index of the branching set is exactly @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , this property does not hold for a @xmath0-knot in a lens space .",
    "moreover , we would like to obtain cyclic branched coverings producing a cyclic presentation for the fundamental group of the manifold .",
    "in order to achieve this , we will select cyclic branched coverings of `` special type '' , and this will be a very natural generalization of the case of knots in @xmath2 .",
    "an @xmath1-fold cyclic covering of @xmath22 branched over the @xmath0-knot @xmath21 will be called _ strongly - cyclic _ if the branching index of @xmath21 is @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the homology class of a meridian loop @xmath67 around @xmath21 is mapped by @xmath66 in a generator of @xmath62 ( up to covering equivalence we can always suppose @xmath68=1 $ ] ) .",
    "strongly - cyclic branched coverings of @xmath0-knots appear to be a suitable tool for producing 3-manifolds with fundamental group admitting cyclic presentation .",
    "for example , it is easy to see that all dunwoody manifolds are coverings of this type .",

    "the loop @xmath86 exists : take a generator @xmath87 of @xmath83 ; if @xmath88=k$ ] then choose any @xmath86 homotopic to @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , take a point @xmath90 and let @xmath91 be an arc from @xmath85 to @xmath92 such that @xmath93 .",
