    "magnetic domain walls ( dws ) have been an important issue in both fundamental physics of magnetism and applications to magnetic devices . besides the phenomenological understanding",
    ", it is not easy to establish the microscopic theory for the formation of dws , as it is basically a nonequilibrium phenomenon with spatial inhomogeneity , often ranging from nano to micrometer scales .",
    "magnetic dws have been studied mainly in classical spin models with neglecting mobile charges , by considering the effects of , e.g. , crystalline shape , lattice symmetry , and magnetic anisotropy@xcite .",
    "spatial modulations of spin textures have been clarified near the dws , such as the so - called bloch , nel , and cross - tie walls .",
    "recently , the magnetic dws have gained renewed interest through the studies toward functional devices based on , e.g. , the giant magnetoresistive effect@xcite , spintronics@xcite , and multiferroics@xcite .",
    "an intriguing issue is the current - induced dw motion .",
    "the controllability of dws by an electric current was experimentally demonstrated in itinerant ferromagnets@xcite .",
    "the microscopic mechanism was theoretically discussed by taking into consideration the interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons@xcite .",
    "another issue discussed very recently is the dws in topological states of matter .",
    "an example has been discussed in the peculiar magnetically ordered state called all - in all - out type in pyrochlore oxides . for instance , in cd@xmath1os@xmath1o@xmath2 , the domain formation was observed using resonant x - ray diffraction , and controllability of the domain structures by a magnetic field - cooling procedure was demonstrated@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , for iridium pyrochlore oxides , peculiar electronic states were theoretically predicted , such as the weyl semimetal  @xcite and peculiar metallic dws@xcite .",
    "experimentally , a hysteresis was observed in the magnetoresistance for nd@xmath1ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , and its relation to the metallic dws was discussed@xcite .",
    "recently , the real - space image of the metallic dws was observed by microwave impedance microscopy  @xcite .    in these dw problems ,",
    "an interesting fundamental issue is how the shape of dws is determined in such itinerant magnets . in most of the previous studies ,",
    "the presence and the shape of dws were introduced ` by hand ' , and the resultant electronic and magnetic properties were studied . for a microscopic understanding of the dw physics , it is crucial to study the dw formation by treating the spin and charge ( and possibly , orbital ) degrees of freedom on an equal footing , without posing any assumption on the patterns of dws .",
    "it is also crucial to incorporate spatial , thermal , and quantum fluctuations for further development , including the creation , annihilation , deformation , and movement of dws .",
    "amongst others , it is strongly desired to enable unbiased calculations of such complicated systems , in spatially large systems ranging up to nano or micrometer scales .    in this paper , as a first step toward such further understanding of dws in itinerant magnets",
    ", we theoretically study the formation of dws by large - scale numerical simulation including the interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "our purpose is to clarify what types of magnetic domains are formed through the interplay . in particular , our focus is on how the shape of the dws is determined for the systems with different electronic and lattice structures .",
    "we also study the electronic properties near the magnetic dws .    for this purpose , we consider a minimal model for the spin - charge coupled systems , the kondo lattice model , which describes mobile charges coupled to classical localized spins . to enable large - scale simulation",
    ", we employ a numerical technique based on the langevin dynamics ( ld ) and kernel polynomial method ( kpm)@xcite . in ref .  , different shapes of the dws were reported for different electron fillings even for the same magnetic structure , while the origin was not referred .",
    "stimulated by the observation , we here study the dw issue in the kondo lattice model in a systematic way , using a modified version of the kpm - ld method by applying stochastic landau - lifshitz ( sll ) dynamics , away from the overdamped limit .    in the present study",
    ", we analyze the formation of magnetic domains by performing the modified kpm - ld simulation with a sudden quench from high - temperature limit to zero temperature .",
    "we study several different magnetically ordered states appearing in the kondo lattice models on square and triangular lattices while varying the electron filling .",
    "we find that , for the collinear nel state on the square lattice and coplanar @xmath3 state on the triangular lattice , the dws do not show a strong preference in their directions in real space . on the other hand , for the noncoplanar spin states with three ordering vectors ( triple-@xmath4 ) on the triangular lattice near 1/4 and 3/4 fillings@xcite , we demonstrate that the dws show very distinct shapes depending on the electron filling , as observed in the previous study@xcite .",
    "we also show that spontaneous electric current , which emerges through the spin berry phase mechanism@xcite , flows along the dws in a different manner between the two cases despite the same magnetic ground states .",
    "we show that the distinct directional preference of dws is brought by the momentum - dependence of effective spin - spin interactions mediated by mobile charges .",

    "the result indicates that @xmath153 changes smoothly from positive to negative across the dw , and @xmath151 exhibits a broad negative peak where @xmath153 is suppressed .",
    "@xmath151 has a nonzero value over about ten sites around the dw , while it shows bumpy behavior presumably due to statistical fluctuations of the small quantity .",
    "the corresponding plots for the 3/4-filling case are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : current](e ) and [ fig : current](f ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath153 changes rather sharply near the dw , and correspondingly , the negative peak of @xmath151 is much sharper than that in the 1/4-filling case ; @xmath151 decays to zero much quicker than that in fig .",
    "[ fig : current](c )",
    ". we also note that the absolute value of @xmath151 at the dw is two orders of magnitude larger than that in fig .",
    "[ fig : current](d ) .    in the case of the triple-@xmath4 state at @xmath133 filling",
    ", we note that the current near the dws flows in the zigzag way , as shown in the enlarged figure in fig .",
    "[ fig : current](e ) ; the local currents are relatively small on the bonds along the dw direction , while they have substantial values along the other two directions near the dws .",
    "this is because the localized spins are almost antiparallel on the bonds along the dws , which suppresses the kinetic motion of mobile charges along this direction .",
    "in the previous section , we found that the magnetic dws may show directional preferences in some cases . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the relationship between the structure of the bare susceptibility @xmath6 and the directional preference of dws .",
    "suppose the system shows a peak in @xmath6 at @xmath154 and a helical ordered state with the ordering wave vector @xmath155 is realized in the ground state .",
    "the following argument is straightforwardly generalized to the cases with multiple wave vectors , e.g. , the triple-@xmath4 states . in the helical ordered state",
    ", a typical spin pattern with a single dw can be described by a superposition of two helices , @xmath156 and @xmath157 , with equal weights , where @xmath158 described a small deviation from @xmath155 .",
    "this dw state exhibits two pairs of bragg peaks in the spin structure factor as @xmath159 note that @xmath27 satisfies the sum rule @xmath39 .",
    "the free energy of the rkky interaction for the dw state is evaluated as @xmath160 suppose this can be expanded by the small @xmath158 , we obtain @xmath161 note that the contribution linear to @xmath158 vanishes because @xmath162 at @xmath163 . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_dw ] ) corresponds to the rkky energy of the helical ordered state without the dw .",
    "hence , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_dw ] ) describes the leading contribution from the dw .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : energy_dw ] ) indicates that the creation of the dw always requires an energy cost as the second derivative of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath164 is always negative at @xmath163 by definition as long as @xmath6 is differentiable with respect to @xmath164 .",
    "the energy cost is minimized when we choose @xmath158 along the direction where @xmath165 at @xmath163 becomes smallest .",
    "this suggests that the dw has a preference in the direction along which the peak of @xmath6 decays most slowly .",
    "the simple analysis well explains the numerical results obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . for nel and @xmath3 states in secs .",
    "[ sec : afm ] and [ sec:120 ] , @xmath6 is rather isotropic in the momentum space , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : neel](b ) and [ fig:120](b ) .",
    "indeed , the values of @xmath166 in the directions a and b are in the same order .",
    "this explains the fact that the dws in these two states do not show a strong preference in their directions . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : afm ] , we noted that in the nel case there is a small preference along the diagonal directions .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that @xmath166 in the b direction is smaller than that in the a direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neel](b ) . on the other hand , for the triple-@xmath4 states discussed in sec",
    ".  [ sec:3q ] , @xmath6 has strongly anisotropic structure , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:3q](c)-[fig:3q](f ) .",
    "the anisotropy depends on the electron filling , which well explains the distinct preference of the dw directions found in the numerical simulations . in the 1/4-filling case , @xmath165 along the direction a is about ten times smaller than b. this explains the reason why the dws prefer the perpendicular directions to the nearest - neighbor bonds of the triangular lattice",
    ". meanwhile , in the 3/4-filling case , @xmath165 along a is more than @xmath167 times larger than b , which is consistent with the formation of dws along the bonds .",
    "let us make two remarks on the simple analysis in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_dw ] ) .",
    "the first one is on the expansion of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath158 . in some cases",
    ", @xmath6 has a singular form with the @xmath108 functional peak at @xmath163 in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "this occurs when the system is at the van hove singularity with @xmath163 .",
    "in fact , this is the case for the nel state and the 3/4-filling triple-@xmath4 state . even in these cases ,",
    "the simple analysis above may be applicable , as the singularity is smeared out at finite temperatures and the dws obey the energetics in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_dw ] ) through the development of @xmath6 while the annealing procedure .",
    "the second point is on the higher - order contributions beyond rkky . in the case of the triple-@xmath4 states discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3q ] , we note that the contributions beyond the rkky interaction plays an essential role in their stabilization mechanism@xcite .",
    "such beyond - rkky contributions , however , are irrelevant in the directional preference of dws , as the dw states with multiple-@xmath4 ordering are also described by a superposition of the multiple-@xmath4 states and the similar argument to the single-@xmath4 helical state will apply to the states . on the other hand",
    ", the higher - order contributions will play a role in the spatial patterns of the spin texture near dws .",
    "this needs more careful analysis , which is out of scope of the present study .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated the formation of magnetic dws through the spin - charge coupling by large - scale numerical simulation .",
    "we have studied the collinear nel , coplanar 120@xmath0 , and noncoplanar triple-@xmath4 states in the kondo lattice model with classical magnetic moments by the modified kpm - ld simulation at zero temperature starting from a random spin configuration , corresponding to the sudden quench .",
    "although neither the nel nor 120@xmath0 state shows a strong preference in the direction of dws , the triple-@xmath4 states near 1/4 and 3/4 fillings exhibit distinct directional preferences depending on the filling . in the 1/4-filling case , dws run dominantly along the directions perpendicular to the nearest - neighbor bonds of the triangular lattice , while in the 3/4-filling case , they strongly favor the directions parallel to the bonds , as observed in the previous study@xcite .",
    "we clarified that the directional preference of magnetic dws in the weak - coupling region is predominantly determined by the electronic structure of mobile charges .",
    "this is rationalized by the fact that , in the weak - coupling region , the effective magnetic interaction , the so - called rkky interaction , is given by the bare susceptibility @xmath6 , which is determined by the electronic band structure and the electron filling .",
    "while the ordering wave vector is determined by the peak of @xmath6 , we found that the directional preference of dws is related with the wave - number dependence around the peak .",
    "when @xmath6 is nearly isotropic around the peak , dws have overall round shapes .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath6 has distinct anisotropy , the directions along which the peak of @xmath6 decays most slowly correspond to the directions strongly preferred by dws .",
    "the former occurs in the collinear nel and coplanar 120@xmath0 states , and the latter in the two noncoplanar triple-@xmath4 states .",
    "in particular , in the triple-@xmath4 states , @xmath6 shows the anisotropy in a different manner between the 1/4- and 3/4-filling states , which is reflected in the different preference of the dw directions .",
    "in the noncoplanar triple-@xmath4 states near 1/4 and 3/4 fillings , we have calculated the spontaneous currents induced along the dws through the spin berry phase mechanism .",
    "we confirmed that , reflecting the opposite sign of the chern numbers , the current flows in the opposite directions at 1/4 and 3/4 fillings , as predicted in the previous studies@xcite .",
    "in addition , we found that the current density is spatially distributed in a wide region in the 1/4-filling case , while it is rather confined in the vicinity of dws in the 3/4-filling case .",
    "we observed the similar tendency in the width of the magnetic dws ( the region in which the triple-@xmath4 order is disturbed ) ; the width of dws is thicker in the 1/4-filling case than the 3/4-filling case .",
    "the distinct behavior is presumably explained by the difference in the electronic states .",
    "the former is metallic , while the latter is insulating ; the electron correlation length is longer in the former , which affects the electronic and magnetic properties in a wider region around the dws .",
    "our analysis provides a simple mechanism of the directional preference of magnetic dws in itinerant magnets . in this mechanism , the shapes of magnetic dws are largely affected by the electronic band structure of mobile charges . in other words ,",
    "our mechanism is based on the momentum - space ( itinerant ) picture , which is different from that by the conventional real - space ( localized ) picture originating from the crystalline shape , magnetic anisotropy , and so on . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , recently , the interesting magnetic dws were observed in several itinerant magnets showing metal - insulator transitions with peculiar magnetic ordering , such as cd@xmath1os@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite and nd@xmath1ir@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the present mechanism , which takes the effect of mobile charges into account , might offer an insight into the dw formation in such systems .",
