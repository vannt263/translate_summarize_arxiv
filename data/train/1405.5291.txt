    "self - consistent approximations have played a crucial role for clarifying basic or exotic properties of diverse condensed matter systems .",
    "lowest - order ones with respect to the interaction are generally known as mean - field or molecular - field theories , which already include many outstanding examples such as the hartree - fock approximation for normal states , weiss and stoner theories for ferromagnetism , and bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory for superconductivity . in general",
    ", the self - consistent scheme has a notable advantage over the simple perturbation expansion that spontaneous symmetry - breaking phases can be described on an equal footing .",
    "this approach can be improved systematically to include higher - order correlations based on a self - consistent perturbation expansion with matsubara green s function,@xcite as first shown by luttinger and ward for normal states.@xcite another advantage of this method is that it satisfies various conservation laws , i.e. , noether s theorem , @xcite as pioneered by kadanoff and baym@xcite and later shown unambiguously by baym.@xcite hence , it can be used to describe nonequilibrium phenomena , including their approach to equilibrium , by transforming the imaginary - time matsubara contour into the real - time schwinger - keldysh contour .",
    "@xcite later , this `` @xmath5-derivable '' or `` conserving '' approximation scheme has also been generalized to relativistic quantum field theory by cornwall , jackiw , and tomboulis ( cjt ) @xcite to find a wide field of applications in high - energy physics with the name of `` two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action.''@xcite    however , extending this powerful formalism to bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) has encountered a serious `` conserving vs.  gapless '' dilemma that either noether s theorem for conservation laws or goldstone s theorem ( i ) for spontaneously broken symmetries is violated in standard approximations,@xcite as first pointed out by hohenberg and martin in 1965.@xcite the basic difficulty lies in how to renormalize the condensate wave function @xmath6 and quasiparticle green s function @xmath2 consistently in the presence of tadpole and other anomalous interaction vertices characteristic of becs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b)-(d ) below ) so as to satisfy the two fundamental theorems simultaneously .",
    "it was shown in a previous paper@xcite that this long - standing problem may be resolved successfully by extending the luttinger - ward theory to becs with the help of an identity for the interaction energy .",
    "the resultant formalism reveals that there should be a new class of feynman diagrams for the self - energy that has been overlooked so far , i.e. , those that may be classified as `` one - particle reducible '' ( 1pr ) due to tadpole and other anomalous interaction vertices.@xcite the rationale for their existence is that they are indispensable for the identity to be satisfied order by order in the self - consistent perturbation expansion with respect to the interaction in the same way as the luttinger - ward functional .",
    "this novel structure of the self - energy has been predicted to modify standard results based on the bogoliubov theory@xcite substantially .",
    "for example , we have pointed out in a previous paper@xcite that it will add a term to the lee - huang - yang expressions@xcite for the ground - state energy and condensate density of the dilute bose gas ; see eq .",
    "( [ lhy - e ] ) below for further details .",
    "we have also shown@xcite that it will transform the single - particle bogoliubov mode with an infinite lifetime into a bubbling mode with a considerable decay rate that is proportional to the @xmath7-wave scattering @xmath8 in the dilute limit .",
    "finally , this single - particle bubbling mode should be different in character from the two - particle collective excitation,@xcite contrary to the standard understanding where both are considered identical.@xcite nevertheless , the two modes may be regarded separately as nambu - goldstone bosons corresponding to the two different proofs;@xcite their contents should be distinguished clearly as `` goldstone s theorem ( i ) '' and `` goldstone s theorem ( ii)''@xcite with the former being identical to the hugenholtz - pines theorem.@xcite    now , purposes of the present paper are twofold .",
    "first , we report a further refinement of this formalism , whose key quantity has been the @xmath5 functional , @xmath9 $ ] , given as a power series of the interaction.@xcite we will show that it can be transformed into a functional @xmath10 $ ] of a single quantity @xmath11 that is defined in terms of @xmath2 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 as eq .",
    "( [ calg ] ) below .",
    "thus , the condensate wave function apparently disappears from @xmath5 , thereby resulting in a considerable reduction in the number of feynman diagrams to be considered .",
    "this fact will be checked specifically up to the forth order of the expansion with respect to the interaction .",
    "it will also be exemplified that any single diagram of the normal state can be a source of an approximate @xmath5 for becs that satisfies both noether s theorem and goldstone s theorem ( i ) .",
    "second , we will trace possible origins of a discrepancy between the present @xmath5 with a one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) structure and the one given by cjt,@xcite which consists of 2pi diagrams that can not be separated by cutting any pair of @xmath2 lines even for spontaneous symmetry - breaking phases of @xmath4 .    in sec .",
