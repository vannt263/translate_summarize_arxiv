    "the co - existence of magnetism and superconductivity in the new iron - chalcogenide superconductors raises the possibility of unconventional pairing mechanisms that may be associated with their magnetism . @xcite as with the more established cuprate superconductors , the iron - based superconductors have layered structures ; the planar fe layers tetrahedrally coordinated by as or chalcogen anions ( se or te ) are believed to be responsible for superconductivity .",
    "stacking of the feas building blocks with alkali , alkaline earth or rare earth - oxygen spacer layers forms the basic classes of iron arsenic superconductors in these compounds : 111-type afeas @xcite , 122-type @xmath5@xcite , 1111-type rofeas @xcite and more complex block containing phases , e.g. @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the simple binary 11-type iron chalcogenides have no spacer layers and superconductivity can be induced by doping fete with s@xcite or se@xcite . unlike the other iron - based superconductors ,",
    "fese is a superconductor @xcite , t@xmath9  k ,  with no static magnetic order and its transition temperature can be increased up to 37  k by applying pressure @xcite or 15  k in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "more recently , superconductivity above 30 k has been reported in @xmath11 ( a = k , cs , rb or tl ) @xcite , a compound with the same unit cell structure as the @xmath5 compounds .",
    "recent neutron diffraction measurements on @xmath12 have suggested that not only does magnetic order co - exist with superconductivity but that the iron moments are remarkably large ( 3.31  @xmath13/fe ) and their magnetic ordering temperature may be as high as 560  k @xcite .",
    "the relatively complex antiferromagnetic structure places all of the iron moments parallel to the c - axis .",
    "muon spin relaxation ( @xmath14 ) has confirmed the high magnetic ordering temperature in @xmath15 @xcite but the development of a paramagnetic component near t@xmath16 suggests that the transition may be first order in nature rather than being a more conventional second order transition .",
    "first order magnetic transitions are commonly associated with changes in crystal structure , and both synchrotron x - ray diffraction @xcite and neutron diffraction @xcite have now shown evidence for a structural change from @xmath17 to @xmath18 associated with a disordering of iron vacancies that occurs in the vicinity of the magnetic transition . however , the magnetic structure adopted by the iron sublattice has not been confirmed , and room temperature neutron diffraction studies of @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 ( a = rb , k ) @xcite have suggested that the iron moments may be much smaller ( @xmath212.5  @xmath13/fe ) and also that the magnetic structure may be far more complex than initially suggested , with the iron atoms being distributed among two ( magnetically ) inequivalent sublattices and carrying very different magnetic moments . moreover , even the ordering _ direction _ has been questioned and it is possible that the iron moments may lie in the ab - plane , at least for @xmath19 @xcite , rather than parallel to the c - axis as initially suggested @xcite .    given the many questions surrounding the magnetic ordering of the iron moments in the @xmath20 system , we have undertaken a @xmath1fe mssbauer study @xmath0 . while mssbauer spectroscopy can not be used to determine magnetic structures directly , it is a quantitative local probe that can be used to set hard limits on possible structures .",
    "as we will show below , the observation of a single , well - split magnetic component allows us to rule out any structure in which the iron sub - lattice is further subdivided into multiple , inequivalent sites , and the scale of the splitting is inconsistent with smaller moment estimates .",
    "furthermore , by working with single crystal samples , we are able to demonstrate that the moments order parallel to the c - axis , ruling out any models that invoke planar ordering . finally , the development of a paramagnetic component that co - exists with the magnetically ordered phase and that grows at its expense on heating through t@xmath16 , confirms that the magnetic transition is indeed first order in nature .",
    "the preparation and characterisation of the crystals used in this study has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite so only a basic description will be provided here .",
    "single crystals of @xmath0 were grown from a @xmath22 melt , as described in ref.@xcite . first the fese precursor was prepared by reacting stoichiometric fe and se at 1050@xmath23c .",
    "then , k and fese with a nominal composition of @xmath24 were placed in an alumina crucible that was sealed in an amorphous silica tube .",
    "the growth was placed in a furnace in a vented enclosure and heated to 1050@xmath23c , where it was held for a 2 hour soak .",
    "the furnace temperature was then slowly lowered to 750@xmath23c over 50 hours ; the furnace was then turned off and the sample `` furnace cooled '' over an additional 10 hours . once the ampoules were opened , large ( @xmath25 @xmath26 ) dark shiny crystals could be mechanically separated from the solidified melt .",
    "crystals were characterised by powder x - ray diffraction using a rigaku miniflex x - ray diffractometer .",
    "the average chemical composition was determined by examining multiple points on a cleaved surface of the crystal , using wavelength dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( wds ) in a jeol jxa-8200 electron microscope . a backscattered electron analysis ( bse )",
    "was performed using an accelerating voltage of 20  kv .",
    "magnetic susceptibility was measured in a quantum design mpms , squid magnetometer .",
    "the x - ray diffraction pattern can be indexed using the i4/mmm space group , with lattice parameters refined by rietica of @xmath27  and @xmath28 , in good agreement with previous values @xcite .",
    "the in - plane resistivity of the furnace cooled sample is very similar to that of earlier reports @xcite : a broad resistive maximum centered near 160  k is followed by a drop of nearly a factor of 6 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the sharp transition to zero resistance gives an onset temperature of t@xmath30  k. corresponding features were also seen in the susceptibility and heat capacity .",
    "the as - grown crystals were too thick to serve as mssbauer absorber but we found that they could be cleaved quite easily using a razor blade , much like mica , and many large - area plates could be formed from each crystal .",
    "two single crystal mosaic samples were prepared from the same batch of crystals .",
    "the first , for low - temperature work , was prepared by attaching several single crystal plates to a 12  mm diameter disc of 100@xmath31 thick kapton foil using apiezon n grease .",
    "care was taken to ensure that there were no gaps , but minimal overlap between the crystals .",
    "this sample was transferred promptly to a vibration - isolated closed - cycle refrigerator with the sample held in vacuum . the second sample , for the high - temperature work ,",
    "was attached to a @xmath32-inch diameter 10-mil beryllium disc using diluted ge-7031 varnish before being mounted in a resistively heated oven , again with the sample in vacuum . while we operated somewhat above the maximum service temperature of the varnish , the sample was cycled above 250@xmath23c three times without any evidence of degradation .",
    "the mssbauer spectra were collected on conventional spectrometers using 50  mci @xmath1co*rh * sources mounted on electromechanical drives operated in constant acceleration mode ( on the high - temperature system ) and sine - mode ( on the low - temperature system ) .",
    "the spectrometers were calibrated against @xmath33fe metal at room temperature .",
    "the closed - cycle refrigerator cools to 10  k , with temperature sensing and control using a calibrated silicon diode mounted on the copper sample stage .",
    "measured gradients ( centre to edge of sample ) in the oven are less than 1  k up to 750  k. control and sensing rely on four type - k thermocouples .",
    "temperature stability in both cases is better than 0.2  k. spectra were fitted using a conventional non - linear least - squares minimisation routine to a sum of equal - width lorentzian lines .",
    "magnetic patterns were fitted assuming first - order perturbation in order to combine the effects of the magnetic hyperfine field ( b@xmath34 ) and the electric field gradient .",

    "the absence of the @xmath35 transitions in the ordered state indicates that the moments are parallel to the crystal c - axis ( see text ) , while the growth of a central paramagnetic component above 500  k is characteristic of a first order magnetic transition .",
    "solid lines are fits as described in the text.,height=453 ]    several conclusions can be reached simply by inspection of the spectrum taken at 10  k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spect ] ) .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a single , well - split , magnetic component .",
    "this confirms that @xmath0 is indeed magnetically ordered in the superconducting state ( recall t@xmath2  k for this sample ) .",
    "the single magnetic component allows us to rule out any magnetic structures involving multiple iron sub - sites with moments that differ by more than a few percent . as we will show below ,",
    "the large hyperfine field ( b@xmath3629  t ) is inconsistent with a small iron moment and so places further limits on possible magnetic structures .",
    "finally , two of the lines normally present in a magnetically split @xmath1fe mssbauer spectra , are clearly absent from the 10  k pattern .",
    "a magnetic field at the @xmath1fe nucleus , either externally applied or transferred from an ordered moment on the iron atom , lifts the degeneracy of the nuclear states and , in combination with the selection rules for the @xmath37 transition , leads to a six - line pattern with intensities of 3:r:1:1:r:3 ( counting from left to right in fig .",
    "[ fig : spect ] ) . for a powder sample , r=2 ,",
    "however if there is a unique angle , @xmath38 , between the magnetic field and the direction of the @xmath39beam used to record the spectrum , then the intensity , r , of the @xmath40 transitions is given by : @xmath41 r=0 implies that @xmath38 is also zero so that the magnetic field , and by extension , the moments that lead to it , is parallel to the @xmath39beam .",
    "since the sample consists of an ab - plane mosaic of single crystals , setting @xmath42 means that the magnetic ordering direction is parallel to the c - axis , ruling out any magnetic structures that involve planar ordering of the iron moments .",
    "we note that r is a relatively soft function of @xmath38 near zero , and a free fit to the intensity of the @xmath40 transitions is consistent with an angle of up to 20@xmath23 , but this does not lead to a significant improvement in @xmath43 for the fit , nor would such an angle be consistent with a planar ordering of the iron moments .",
    "indeed , if the ordering were planar , then r would be 4 , and the @xmath40 transitions would provide the strongest features in the spectrum .    estimating the iron moment from the observed hyperfine field requires some care as the scaling is imperfect at best@xcite .",
    "however , some data exist on binary iron  chalcogenides that can be used as a guide ( table  [ tab : conv ] ) .",
    "if we use the factor of 6.2  t/@xmath13 for @xmath44 with our measured b@xmath34 of 29.4  t we obtain a rather large estimate of 4.7  @xmath13/fe for the iron moment in this system .",
    "this is significantly larger than the 3.31  @xmath13/fe reported on the basis of neutron diffraction@xcite , however it does suggest that the iron moment is indeed substantial as even the larger conversion factor for the sulphide yields 3.5  @xmath13/fe .",
    "if we assume that b@xmath34 is at least proportional to the iron moment , then we can use the observed change in b@xmath34 between 10  k and 293  k to scale the 3.31  @xmath13/fe observed at 11  k@xcite to get an estimate of 3.0  @xmath13/fe for the moment at room temperature for comparison with the much smaller value of 2.55  @xmath13/fe reported by pomjakushin _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "however , the strong temperature dependence of magnetic signal noted by bao _",
    "et al._@xcite suggests a very rapid decline in ordered moment to about 2.8  @xmath13/fe by room temperature .",
    "it is possible that much of the variation may be intrinsic to the material and its variable stoichiometry , so that combined measurements on a well characterised sample will be needed to settle this .",

    "mssbauer spectroscopy , while sensitive to the presence of impurity phases , does not rely on normalisation to the total sample in order to determine moments , they come rather from the observed line splitting , and not the intensity .",
    "neutron diffraction , by contrast , while providing far more information on the magnetic ordering , ultimately relies on peak intensities , normalised to the total nuclear scattering , to determine the magnetic moments .",

    "this image reveals that there is , at the micron scale , a modulation in the surface composition that can be correlated , through a preliminary line - scan analysis of the wds data , with reductions of k content in the lighter regions .",
