    "transversity quark distributions in the nucleon remain among the most unknown leading twist hadronic observables .",
    "this is mostly due to their chiral odd character which enforces their decoupling in most hard amplitudes .",
    "after the pioneering studies @xcite , much work @xcite has been devoted to the exploration of many channels but experimental difficulties have challenged the most promising ones .",
    "the recent focus on transversity dependent observables in single inclusive deep inelastic scattering propose to assume the factorization of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) and fragmentation functions .",
    "this allowed recently some first extraction of chiral odd quantities , demonstrating , although in a weak sense , their non - zero value . here",
    "we restrict on the use of leading twist factorizable quantities , such as integrated parton distributions , distribution amplitudes or generalized parton distributions .",
    "a new way to access the chiral odd transversity parton distribution in the proton emerges thanks to the observation that the photon twist 2 distribution amplitude ( da ) @xcite is chiral - odd .",
    "this latter object is normalized to the magnetic susceptibility of the qcd vacuum .",
    "it is defined as @xmath0 where the normalization is chosen as @xmath1 , and @xmath2 stands for the momentum fraction carried by the quark .",
    "the product of the quark condensate and of the magnetic susceptibility of the qcd vacuum @xmath3 has been estimated to be of the order of 50 mev .",
    "the basic ingredient @xcite is the interference of the usual bethe heitler or drell - yan amplitudes with the amplitude of a process , where the photon couples to quarks through this chiral - odd da .",
    "we thus consider the process ( @xmath4 is the transverse polarization vector of the nucleon ) : @xmath5 with @xmath6 in the kinematical region where @xmath7 is large and the transverse component @xmath8 of @xmath9 is of the same order as @xmath10 .",
    "such a process occurs either through a bethe - heitler amplitude ( fig .",
    "1a ) where the initial photon couples to a final lepton , or through drell - yan type amplitudes ( fig .",
    "1b ) where the final leptons originate from a virtual photon . among these drell - yan processes",
    ", one must distinguish the cases where the real photon couples directly ( through the qed coupling ) to quarks or through its quark content , _",
    "i.e. _ the photon structure function .",
    "gluon radiation at any order in the strong coupling @xmath11 , does not introduce any chiral - odd quantity if one neglects quark masses .",
    "we next consider the contributions where the photon couples to the strong interacting particles through its twist-2 distribution amplitude ( fig .",
    "1c and 1d ) .",
    "one can easily see by inspection that this is the only way to get at the level of twist 2 ( and with vanishing quark masses ) a contribution to nucleon transversity dependent observables .",
    "we call this amplitude @xmath12 : @xmath13u(r ) \\bar u(p)\\gamma^\\mu v(p ' ) \\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 and @xmath15 . @xmath16 and @xmath17 do not depend on the light - cone fraction @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath12 develops an absorptive part proportional to @xmath18u(r ) \\bar u(p)\\gamma^\\mu v(p')\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this allows to perform the @xmath19integration , the result of which , after using the @xmath20 symmetry of the distribution amplitude , yields an absorptive part of the amplitude @xmath12 proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "this absorptive part , which may be measured in single spin asymmetries , as discussed below , thus scans the photon chiral - odd distribution amplitude .",
    "the cross section for reaction ( [ process ] ) can be read as @xmath22 where @xmath23 contains various interferences , while the transversity dependent differential cross section ( we denote @xmath24 ) reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 contains only interferences between the amplitude @xmath12 and the other amplitudes .",
    "moreover , one may use the distinct charge conjugation property ( with respect to the lepton part ) of the bethe heitler amplitude to select the interference between @xmath12 and the bethe - heitler amplitude : @xmath27    the polarization average of @xmath28 reads : @xmath29 with the usual lorentz invariant phase space factor dlips @xmath30 , ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33   + \\frac{q^2\\,[2\\vec l_\\perp.\\vec q_\\perp + ( \\gamma- \\bar \\gamma ) \\vec q_\\perp ^2 ] } { ( \\gamma q^2 -2\\vec l_\\perp.\\vec q_\\perp + \\bar   \\gamma \\vec q_\\perp ^2)(\\bar \\gamma q^2 + 2\\vec l_\\perp.\\vec q_\\perp +   \\gamma \\vec q_\\perp ^2 ) } \\ , ,    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath34   -\\frac{\\vec q_\\perp^2\\,[q^2+\\vec q_\\perp ^2 ] } { ( \\gamma q^2 -2\\vec l_\\perp.\\vec q_\\perp + \\bar   \\gamma \\vec q_\\perp ^2)(\\bar \\gamma q^2 + 2\\vec l_\\perp.\\vec q_\\perp +   \\gamma \\vec q_\\perp ^2 ) } \\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this observable is proportional to the transversity nucleon distribution @xmath35 at the position @xmath36 , which is fixed by the event kinematics .",
    "we are thus in a position to scan the transversity quark distribution .",
    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) offer a new way to access the transversity dependent quark content of the nucleon .",
    "the factorization properties of exclusive amplitudes allows in principle to extract the four chiral - odd transversity gpds  @xcite , noted @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "their access is however quite challenging  @xcite : one photon or one meson electroproduction leading twist amplitudes are insensitive to transversity gpds .",
    "a possible way out is to consider higher twist contributions to these amplitudes @xcite , which however are beyond the factorization proofs and often plagued with end - point singularities .",
    "the strategy which we followed in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite , is to study the leading twist contribution to exclusive processes where more mesons are present in the final state .",
    "a similar strategy has also been advocated recently in ref .",
    "@xcite to enlarge the number of processes which could be used to extract information on chiral - even gpds .      in the example developed in  @xcite",
    ", the process under study is the high energy photo ( or electro ) diffractive production of two vector mesons , the hard probe being the virtual `` pomeron '' exchange ( and the hard scale being the virtuality of this pomeron ) , in analogy with the virtual photon exchange occuring in the deep inelastic electroproduction of a meson .",
    "the chiral - odd light - cone da for the transversely polarized meson vector @xmath42 , is defined , in leading twist 2 , by the matrix element : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the @xmath41-meson transverse polarization and with @xmath45 = 160 mev .",
    "we consider the specific process : @xmath46 of scattering of a virtual photon on a nucleon @xmath47 , which leads via two gluon exchange to the production of two vector mesons separated by a large rapidity gap and the scattered nucleon @xmath48 .",
    "we choose a charged vector meson @xmath49 since it requires quark antiquark exchange in the @xmath50channel with the nucleon line .",
    "we consider the kinematical region where the rapidity gap between @xmath49 and @xmath48 is much smaller than the one between @xmath51 and @xmath49 , that is the energy of the system ( @xmath52 ) is smaller than the energy of the system ( @xmath53 ) but still large enough to justify our approach ( in particular much larger than baryonic resonance masses ) .",
    "we have shown that in such kinematical circumstance , the born term for this process is calculable consistently within the collinear factorization method .",
    "the final result is represented as an integral ( over the longitudinal momentum fractions of the quarks ) of the product of two amplitudes : the first one describing the transition @xmath54 via two gluon exchange and the second one describing the subprocess @xmath55 which is closely related to the electroproduction process @xmath56 where collinear factorization theorems allow to separate the long distance dynamics expressed through the gpds from a perturbatively calculable coefficient function . the case of transversally polarized vector meson @xmath57 involves the chiral - odd gpd .",
    "the hard scale appearing in this process is supplied by the relatively large momentum transfer @xmath58 in the two gluon channel , i.e. by the virtuality of the pomeron .",
    "we have shown that the collinear factorization holds at least in the born approximation .",
    "the resulting scattering amplitude @xmath59 has a very compact form :    @xmath60\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the angle between the transverse polarization vector of the target @xmath62 and the polarization vector @xmath63 of the produced @xmath64meson .",
    "the flavour non - diagonal transversity gpd @xmath65 between an initial proton and a final neutron is the difference of the flavour diagonal transversity gpds @xmath66 , @xmath67 of quarks @xmath68 and @xmath69 inside a proton .",
    "we assumed also that the mandelstam variable @xmath70 takes its minimal value which means that only the transversity gpd @xmath37 contributes to the process ( [ 2mesongen ] ) .",
    "@xmath71 is the impact factor @xmath72 with @xmath73 written as : @xmath74 one can write similar formulas for the impact factor describing the transition @xmath75 .",
    "the scattering amplitude ( [ con ] ) receives a contribution only from the erbl region .",
    "thus one needs a model for the @xmath76 gpds in this region . for this aim",
    "we generalized the model of nucleon tensor charge proposed in the ref .",
    "@xcite to the non - forward kinematics . in order to make our preditions more reliable",
    "we compared our estimates for the process ( [ 2mesongen ] ) which involves the transversity gpd with a similar proces @xmath77 of production of two longitudinally polarized @xmath41 mesons , which is sensitive to the usual chiral - even gpds .",
    "we modellized the chiral - even gpds using method based on the double distribution .",
    "the comparison of the differential cross sections for unpolarized beam and target @xmath78 for both processes is shown in fig .",
    "note that , contrarily to transversity pdfs , transversity gpds enter the formulae for cross sections even when considering unpolarized proton target , provided one selects the polarization state of an outgoing meson .     and",

    "we thus study @xcite the exclusive photoproduction of a transversely polarized vector meson and a pion on a polarized or unpolarized proton target    @xmath84    in the kinematical regime of large invariant mass @xmath85 of the final meson pair and small momentum transfer @xmath86 between the initial and the final nucleons .",
    "the hard factorization scale is this invariant mass @xmath85 . roughly speaking",
    ", these kinematics mean a moderate to large , and approximately opposite , transverse momentum of each meson .",
    "the amplitude gets contributions from each of the four twist 2 chiral - odd gpds .",
    "however , all of them but @xmath37 are accompanied by kinematical factors which vanish at @xmath87 the contribution proportional to @xmath37 is thus dominant in the small @xmath88 domain which we are interested in and we restrict our study to this contribution , so that the whole @xmath50dependence will come from the @xmath88-dependence of @xmath37 .",
