    "pohlmeyer reduction applied to classical superstring theory leads to a generalised sine - gordon type model described by a particular bosonic @xmath19 gauged wzw theory with an integrable potential coupled to fermions . since the virasoro conditions are solved in the process of the pohlmeyer reduction , the reduced theory may be viewed as an analog of a `` light - cone gauge - fixed '' version of the original string theory . while the conformal - gauge string theory ( st ) and the associated pohlmeyer - reduced theory ( prt ) are closely related at the classical level , prt has important simplifying features being 2d lorentz invariant and quadratic in fermions which have standard 2d kinetic terms .",
    "when expanded near the respective vacua , the two theories are described by the equivalent sets of 8 + 8 boson+fermion physical 2d fields . this raises a hope that prt may be useful in an attempt to solve the st from first principles .",
    "the relation between the st and prt is established at the classical level and involves a transformation from coset currents to new fields in a way that solves the conformal gauge conditions algebraically ( both theories originate from the same set of first - order equations for the currents ) .",
    "the classical solutions are thus in correspondence ( though the values of the two actions on the associated solutions are , in general , different )",
    ". there are also close similarities between the associated tree - level s - matrices and the soliton spectra of the theories .",
    "the relation between the st and prt at the quantum level is a priori unclear .",
    "nevertheless , given their classical connection , and the integrability and uv finiteness of both theories , one may conjecture that the two quantum theories should also be closely related .",
    "the precise form of such a relation remains to be understood .",
    "an indication of a quantum relation is the equality of the one - loop partition functions of the two theories computed by expanding near `` dual '' solutions z_st^^(1 ) = z_prt ^^(1 ) . while one may be tempted to view this one - loop relation as a consequence of the classical equivalence of the two theories ( suggesting that determinants of small fluctuation operators found by perturbing the classical solutions should match ) , it is still a non - trivial test of the correspondence between the underlying physical degrees of freedom of the two theories .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to explore possible relations between the two quantum partition functions at the two - loop level .",
    "since the two - loop computations in a non - trivial background are , in general , very complicated here we will consider the simplest string solution  the infinite spin ( scaling ) limit of the folded spinning @xmath20 string in @xmath21 subspace of and the associated solution of the reduced theory . as a further simplification we will eventually consider the limit @xmath22 when the logarithm of the string theory worldsheet partition function is simply proportional to a function of the coupling constant ( i.e. to the universal scaling function of string tension on the string theory side ) .",
    "our conclusion ( in both and cases that we consider below ) appears to be as follows : while the non - trivial parts of the two two - loop partition functions ( coming from the most complicated two - loop integrals ) appear to be direct correspondence , the reduced theory partition function contains an extra two - loop term proportional to the square of the one - loop coefficient . thus if the two quantum partition functions are indeed related , this relation may be effectively non - linear .",
    "it is possible also that the matching of two partition functions may be restored by modifying the prt action by a certain one - loop counterterm that may be required to maintain its quantum integrability , i.e. to preserve certain hidden ( super)symmetries .",
    "these ideas remain to be explored .",
    "let us first review the known structure of the two - loop string partition in the long spinning string background .",
    "the @xmath20 spinning string background in the large spin limit has the following form in terms of the embedding coordinates ( below @xmath23 where @xmath3 is string tension ) y_0+iy_5= ( ) e^i ,   y_1+iy_2= ( ) e^i ,   y_3,4=0 , + x_1+ix_2=e^i ,  x_3,4,5,6=0 , where the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are related by ^2= ^2+^2  ,    = 1  1  ,  = .",

    "we indicated separately the part coming from purely bosonic graphs and graphs involving fermions .",
    "the spectrum of the string fluctuation modes includes ( in the @xmath35 limit and after rescaling of masses by @xmath36 ) : one @xmath37 mode with @xmath38 , two @xmath39 modes `` transverse '' to @xmath37 with @xmath40 , five @xmath41 modes with @xmath42 and eight fermionic modes with @xmath43 .",
    "contributions proportional to @xmath34 originate from two - loop `` sunset '' graphs with three propagators that are expressed in terms of the following momentum integrals & & i[m_i^2,m_j^2,m_k^2 ]  , + & & i[4,2,2]=1 ( 4 ) ^2  ,    i[2,1,1]= 2 ( 4 ) ^2  . here",
    "both the bosonic @xmath44 $ ] and the fermionic @xmath45 $ ] contributions involve the `` transverse '' @xmath39 modes with @xmath40 . since such modes are absent in the case of the @xmath46 superstring theory one expects to find there no catalan constant contribution .",

    "the coupling constant @xmath9 of the reduced theory is undetermined by the classical reduction procedure .",

    "one may conjecture that k = 2  . while the matching of the one - loop partition functions ( [ eqpa ] ) is not sensitive to the values of the two coupling constants ( as they do not enter the determinants of the quadratic fluctuation operators )",
    "the comparison of higher - loop quantum corrections crucially depends on a relation like ( [ con ] ) .",
    "our aim below will be to compute the two - loop correction to the partition function of the prt defined by ( [ jp ] ) expanded near a solution which is a counterpart of the long spinning string solution ( [ sj ] ) . in the reduced theory",

    "the computational procedure we used in the prt ( called `` first approach '' below ) led , in fact , to an ir divergent result @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is an ir cutoff .",
    "we believe this should be an artifact of our approach in case in which the unphysical ( non - coset ) massless excitations were not explicitly decoupled .    to test the expectation that an alternative computational procedure that does not involve unphysical propagating degrees of freedom should lead to an ir finite result for @xmath76 we have repeated the same two - loop computation in a very similar but simpler setting of the reduced theory for the @xmath46 superstring . while same approach as used in case here led again to an ir divergent coefficient , @xmath77 , the `` second approach '' based on integrating out the 2d gauge fields and gauge - fixing @xmath78 led to a consistent finite two - loop result ads_3 s^3 :   & & ( k_3 ) = _1 + 2 _2 k_3   +   o ( 1 k^2_3 )  , +   & & _1 = - 2 2  ,",

    "it remains to be understood if the apparent disagreement of the two - loop coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath79 in string and reduced theories by precisely the square of the one - loop coefficient is still hinting at some relation between the two universal scaling functions .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",

    "it is also unclear how to find a `` mixed '' gauge which would ensure the decoupling of the unphysical fluctuations beyond the quadratic fluctuation level .    in discussing case in this paper",
