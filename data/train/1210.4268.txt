    "the influence of long - range strains on the electronic properties is a unique feature of graphene  @xcite . at low - energy spectrum , strains give rise to a pseudomagnetic field which is added to the momentum operators  @xcite and thus a gauge field couples to electrons .",
    "the most evidence of the unusual way in which strains affect the electronic states comes from scanning tunneling microscope measurements of the electronic local density of states of graphene grown on platinum  @xcite .",

    "the presence of ripples in graphene samples and their influence on the electronic properties are open problems in the field for instance graphene on top of sio@xmath2 or sic surface experiences a moderate strain due to surface corrugations or lattice mismatch .",
    "the fermi velocity is an essential quantity in graphene because all the observable quantities depend on it . for the dirac electrons in pristine graphene ,",
    "it was shown  @xcite that interaction effects also become noticeable with decreasing density in that the velocity is enhanced rather than suppressed , and that the influence of interactions on the compressibility and the spin - susceptibility changes sign .",
    "these qualitative differences are due to _ exchange interactions _ between electrons near the fermi surface and electrons in the negative energy sea and to interband contributions to dirac electrons from charge and spin fluctuations .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite have been able to measure the renormalized fermi velocity and they claimed that the fermi velocity is no longer constant but increases by decreasing the electron density . on the other hand , it was shown  @xcite , from first principles calculations , that the group velocities under uniaxial strain exhibit a strong anisotropy .",

    "<S> we consider the effect of the coulomb interaction in strained graphene using tight - binding approximation together with the hartree - fock interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the many - body energy dispersion relation , anisotropic fermi velocity renormalization and charge compressibility in the presence of uniaxial strain are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the quasiparticle quantities are sensitive to homogenous strain and indeed , to its sign . </S>",
    "<S> the charge compressibility is enhanced by stretching and suppressed by compressing a graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> we find a reduction of fermi velocity renormalization along the direction of graphene deformation , in good agreement with the recent experimental observation . </S>"
