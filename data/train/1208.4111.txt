    "a key component to understanding supernovae ( sne ) is the mapping between the explosions and their progenitor stars .",
    "slow , steady progress is being made , and it is now well established that type  iip sn are associated with red supergiants ( see the review by @xcite ) . there is a puzzle , however , in that the observed upper limit of @xmath7 on the masses type  iip sn progenitors appears to be significantly lower than the maximum masses of @xmath8 for stars expected to explode while still red supergiants ( @xcite ) , part of a more general absence of massive sn progenitors ( see @xcite ) . since these `` missing '' progenitors",
    "should be more luminous than those which are being discovered , they must either be hidden , evolve differently than expected , or fail to explode .",
    "for example , in the rotating models of @xcite , the upper mass limit for red supergiants is lower , with @xmath9 stars being blue rather than red at the onset of carbon burning .",
    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite find that the progenitor masses of @xmath10-@xmath11 corresponding to the upper mass range for red supergiants are more prone to failed explosions and prompt black hole formation , and such events would have to be found by searching for stars disappearing rather than explosions appearing ( @xcite ) .",
    "binary evolution can also alter the distribution of final states at the time of explosion given the high probability for mass transfer as stars expand to become red supergiants ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the discrepancy is not explained by the physics of stellar evolution or explosion , then the most likely remaining explanation is the effect of circumstellar dust .",
    "for example , @xcite note that more massive and luminous red supergiants have stronger winds which can form dust and partly obscure the star .",
    "this then biases ( in particular ) the upper mass limits associated with failed searches for progenitor stars , since the luminosity limits must be corrected for an unknown amount of circumstellar dust extinction . @xcite and",
    "@xcite recently analyzed the progenitor of sn  2012aw , finding that it was both relatively high mass ( @xmath12-@xmath9 for @xcite and @xmath13-@xmath14 for @xcite ) and the most heavily obscured of any sn progenitor other than the completely obscured ( and debated ) sn  2008s class ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since most of the extinction vanished after the sn , the dust must have been circumstellar ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    like most studies of circumstellar dust in supernovae or supernovae progenitors , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite treat circumstellar dust as if it is a foreground screen that can be quantitatively modeled using galactic interstellar extinction curve models parametrized by the value of @xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "usually only studies that are self - consistently calculating emission by the dust correctly model the absorption by circumstellar dust ( e.g. studies of the sn  2008s class of transients by @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "but three well - known effects mean that it is never appropriate to make this approximation unless the optical depth is negligible compared to the required precision of the analysis",
    ". first , emission from circumstellar dust can be important in the near - ir if the star is presently forming dust at temperatures of @xmath16-@xmath17  k. this matters most for hotter stars with less intrinsic near - ir emission than the red supergiants we consider here .",
    "second , interstellar dust has the average composition of dust from all sources , while individual stars have the dust associated with their particular chemistry .",
    "this is relevant here because @xmath18 stars generally produce silicate rather than graphitic dusts ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the third , and least appreciated point , is the different role of scattered photons in interstellar and circumstellar extinction .",
    "this issue has been discussed in detail by @xcite and @xcite in the context of anomalously low estimates of @xmath15 for type  ia sn , but correctly treating the problem has not become a matter of practice . for a foreground screen , scattered light forms a very diffuse , extended halo around the source which is not included in the estimate of the source flux .",
    "this halo can sometimes be seen as the extended dust echoes of transient sources ( e.g. @xcite ) . if the circumstellar dust is unresolved , however , the scattered light is simply included in the total flux .",
    "thus , for interstellar extinction you observe only the direct , unabsorbed and unscattered emission , while for circumstellar extinction you observe both the direct unabsorbed and the scattered emission .",
    "_ most of the observed optical emission from a moderately self - obscured star is scattered light . _    fig .",
    "[ fig : modsed ] shows an example generated by dusty ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) using the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a @xmath19  k black body surrounded by @xmath20 ( scattering plus absorption ) of cold silicate dust .",
    "the dusty material has a density profile of @xmath21 in a shell with @xmath22 .",
    "galactic ( interstellar ) extinction corresponds to putting the dust at such a large radius that we no longer include the scattered light in the observed flux of the star , and the extinction law corresponds to the wavelength dependent difference between the input spectrum and the directly escaping spectrum .",
    "[ fig : moddir ] shows this ratio converted into an extinction law @xmath23 for pure graphitic , pure silicate and a 50:50 mix of the two , as compared to @xcite galactic extinction laws with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "galactic dust models typically have a roughly 50:50 mix of graphitic and silicate grains ( see the summary in @xcite ) , and using this mix in the dusty models roughly reproduces a typical @xmath27 galactic extinction law .",
    "the match is not perfect because there are differences in the assumed size distributions .    for a star surrounded by an unresolved shell of dust , however , the emission we measure is the sum of the direct and scattered light , which is very different from the direct emission alone .",
    "[ fig : modall ] shows this case converted into an effective circumstellar extinction law for the same three dust mixtures . for circumstellar dust ,",
    "all three examples are now significantly below the @xmath27 curve and a given change in color implies a significantly smaller change in luminosity .",
    "if we fit the absorption in these dusty models with @xcite extinction models , the best fits for the graphitic , silicate and 50:50 dusts are @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "these are the best fits for @xmath20 from @xmath31 m ( u band ) to @xmath32 m .",
    "the best fits vary modestly ( @xmath33 ) with @xmath34 and the fitted wavelength range , become worse for higher optical depths , and there are no truly good fits .",
    "[ fig : modall ] superposes these @xcite extinction curves on the dusty models .",
    "@xcite found similar estimates for the best @xcite extinction curves to model circumstellar dust and also noted that they are not very good approximations .    the final point to note in figs .",
    "[ fig : moddir ] and [ fig : modall ] is that the dust composition is quantitatively important .",
    "interstellar dust is a mixture of graphitic and silicate dusts from many sources .",
    "individual stars , however , typically only produce silicate or graphitic dusts depending on the carbon to oxygen abundance ratio of the stellar atmosphere . to zeroth order , all available carbon and oxygen bond to make co. then , a carbon poor ( rich ) atmosphere has excess oxygen ( carbon ) to make silicate ( graphitic ) dusts .",
    "the atmospheres of @xmath35 red supergiants usually form silicate dusts ( e.g. @xcite ) because they never undergo the dredge up phases that enrich the atmospheres of the lower mass agb stars with carbon ( e.g. @xcite ) . assuming a mixed interstellar composition will generally overestimate the absorption associated with a given change in color for silicate dusts and underestimate it for graphitic dusts .    in this paper",
    "we consider the effects of dust on the progenitor of sn  2012aw in more detail .",
    "first , in  [ sec : midir ] we use archival spitzer irac data to set stringent limits on the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and @xmath36 m fluxes of the progenitor , and then model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the progenitor with dusty in order to correctly model absorption , scattering and emission from a dust enshrouded star .",
    "we highlight where any extinction law derived for dust screens at great distances from the source such as the standard @xcite extinction laws can create problems .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : discussion ] we summarize the results and provide simple interpolation formulas for extinction by graphitic and silicate circumstellar dust as a function of wavelength and optical depth .",
    "as noted by @xcite , there are no obvious sources in the archival sings ( @xcite ) irac images of the region around the progenitor .",
    "it is , however , a relatively clean region with the emission dominated by unresolved stars , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] .",
    "we identified 8 nearby stars in common between the hst i - band image used by @xcite and @xcite to identify the progenitor and the image formed by co - adding the @xmath37 and @xmath38 m data and used the iraf geomap / geotran scripts to estimate the position of the progenitor shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] . based on jackknife resampling of the reference stars ,",
    "the nominal uncertainties in the position are small ( about 005 ) .    since we are essentially confusion limited , we estimated flux limits using the grid of 36 apertures covering the location of the progenitor and bounded by the nearby brighter stars as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] .",
    "the grid spacing was 30 .",
    "we used the iraf apphot / phot to measure aperture magnitudes with a signal radius of 24 and a sky annulus from 24 to 72 .",
    "the fluxes were calibrated following the procedures given in the _ spitzer _ data analysis cookbook and aperture corrections of 1.213 , 1.234 , 1.379 , and 1.584 for the 3.6 through @xmath36 m bands .",
    "keeping the sky annulus immediately next to the signal aperture minimizes the effects of background variations created by the galaxy .",
    "we used a @xmath39 outlier rejection procedure in order to exclude sources located in the local sky annulus , and correct for the excluded pixels assuming a gaussian background flux distribution .",
    "we clipped 3 of the grid points in the wings of the brighter sources and the two lowest ( negative ) flux points that lay in an obvious `` dark lane '' , leaving 31 points . based on one of the two sings epochs ,",
    "the variances in the four bands are @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43  @xmath44jy for the @xmath37 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath36 m bands respectively .",
    "this is well above the nominal noise level for the exposure time ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath49  @xmath44jy ) because there is stellar emission in the region .",
    "the variance after coadding the two sings epochs is only slightly smaller , as expected for noise dominated by confusion , so we rather conservatively use the variances derived from the single epoch as @xmath50 flux limits . note that some of the grid points clearly lie on sources in the coadded image .",
    "these sources are not readily apparent in the four individual sub - images , where their detection significance would be roughly @xmath39 .",
    "a source of similar flux at the supernova position would be equally obvious in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] .    for models of the spectral energy distribution , we combined the v and i band estimates from @xcite and @xcite , including the difference in their v - band estimates as an additional systematic error .",
    "we used the j and k@xmath51 estimates from @xcite , based on their better photometric calibrations .",
    "we use a minimum flux uncertainty of 20% , which broadens the v , i and j - band photometric errors , given that the data were obtained over a long time period ( 1994 - 2009 , with the sings irac data being obtained on 22/23 may 2004 ) and @xcite argue for the detection of variability at v and i. we model the star using the marcs ( @xcite ) stellar atmosphere models , considering only the @xmath52 , solar metallicity , @xmath53  km / s turbulent velocity @xmath54 models preferred by @xcite and also considered by @xcite .",
    "these are available for effective temperatures of @xmath55 to @xmath56  k in steps of @xmath57  k and then @xmath58 and @xmath59  k. for intermediate temperatures we linearly interpolate between the available models .",
    "we averaged the high resolution marcs models and the filter transmission functions onto a coarser wavelength grid for use in the dusty models and then generated magnitude estimates for each model including the appropriate averages over the filter band passes .",
    "we first fit the measurements to normalize the luminosity , and then added a contribution from the upper limits as @xmath60 for each band , where @xmath61 is the estimate from the normalized model and @xmath62 is the @xmath50 limit on the flux .",
    "@xcite reported a swift ( @xcite ) x - ray detection of the sn in the first week and @xcite and @xcite report @xmath10  ghz radio detections in the first month .",
    "swift continued to monitor the sn for an extended period , so as an independent probe of the circumstellar medium we obtained all the archival swift xrt data , binning the observations as summarized in table  [ tab : xray ] .",
    "we reprocessed the xrt data using the ` xrtpipeline ` tool provided by the swift team .",
    "we binned the observations into six roughly logarithmic time intervals and then reprojected each group of observations into a single image .",
    "we chose the source region to be a circle centered on the sn with a radius of 10 pixels ( 236 ) and a nearby background region without any sources , using aperture corrections based on the analysis of the swift psf by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we assumed a galactic foreground column density of @xmath63 ( @xcite ) . for our epoch",
    "best matching @xcite we reproduce their count rates . while none of the x - ray detections are of very high significance , there appears to be a low level of detectable ( @xmath64 ) and probably time varying x - ray emission for the first 12 months .",
    "there are no clear detections at low energies ( @xmath65@xmath47  kev ) and only very marginal detections at high energies ( @xmath66@xmath67  kev )  the observed counts are completely dominated by the @xmath47@xmath66  kev band .",
    "we use the dusty ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) dust radiation transfer models to correctly include dust emission , absorption , scattering and composition when modeling the progenitor sed .",
    "we use either graphitic or silicate dust models from @xcite and the default @xcite power - law grain size distribution ( @xmath68 for @xmath69 ) .",
    "the dust lies in a spherical shell with a @xmath70 density distribution and a @xmath71 axis ratio between the inner and outer radii . while the directly escaping light depends only on the optical depth , thicker shells ( larger @xmath72 ) allow more scattered light to escape than thin shells for the same total optical depth , but this is a second order effect and we will hold @xmath72 fixed .",
    "the model parameters are the luminosity of the star , @xmath73 , the temperature of the star , @xmath74 , the temperature @xmath75 of the dust at @xmath76 , and the dust optical depth @xmath34 at v - band ( @xmath77 m ) .",
    "this is the total ( absorption plus scattering ) optical depth , @xmath78 , where the scattering optical depth is related to the total optical depth by the albedo , @xmath79 .",
    "the effective absorption optical depth is approximately @xmath80 . at v - band , the standard dusty silicate ( graphitic )",
    "dust models have albedos of @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , so for the same effective absorption the silicate models require significantly higher total optical depths @xmath34 .",
    "the v - band extinction is approximately @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) for the silicate ( graphitic ) model .",
    "the radius @xmath76 is then a derived quantity given the model parameters .",
    "we fit the data and estimate uncertainties by embedding dusty in a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) driver . without mid - ir detections",
    ", we can not determine the dust temperature , so we simply considered cases with @xmath85  k , @xmath86  k , @xmath16  k and @xmath87  k. we assume a fixed foreground galactic extinction of @xmath88  mag ( modeled using an @xmath27 extinction law ) and a distance modulus of @xmath89  mag ( @xcite ) .    while they are not physically correct models , we do recover the results of @xcite and @xcite if we model our version of the sed including the mid - ir flux limits but no dust emission and using @xcite extinction laws .",
    "like @xcite we find that higher @xmath15 extinction laws provide better fits , but we also find a stellar temperature degeneracy similar to @xcite .",
    "clearly the models have a `` degeneracy '' direction which is very sensitive to the exact assumptions of the model and can lead to either tight or loose limits on the effective temperature .",
    "the specific rationale for using @xmath90 extinction laws in @xcite is not really valid , based on the finding of @xcite that matching spectroscopic and b@xmath91v color estimates of @xmath92 requires using larger effective value of @xmath15 for the photometric estimate .",
    "however , the problem @xcite was addressing does not correspond to changing @xmath15 at all wavelengths in a general fit to an sed . @xcite",
    "were correcting for the shift in effective filter wavelengths at blue and ultraviolet wavelengths between the o stars usually used to build models for the extinction curve and low temperature red supergiants .",
    "the effective wavelength of a filter is an average of the wavelength weighted by the spectrum over the filter transmission function . where the spectrum is changing rapidly and",
    "can not be modeled as a linear trend , the effective wavelength shifts .",
    "this is primarily an issue on the `` wien '' tails of stellar spectra , where the effective wavelength for a cool star is significantly redder than that of a hot star . for the @xmath93",
    "k marcs models , the b , v and i band shifts relative to an o star are roughly 8% , 3% and 2% , and then become steadily smaller at longer wavelengths . @xcite",

    "mathematically , the observed color is @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the @xmath27 extinction law at the shifted , effective wavelengths of the b and v bands for the cold star .",
    "thus , getting the correct @xmath92 from the observed color corresponds to using @xmath97 so that @xmath98 . for the @xmath93",

    "_ this is a specific correction for the distortion of the b@xmath91v colors by the wavelength shifts and not a change in the overall extinction curve .",
    "_ at redder wavelengths , the wavelength shifts become steadily smaller and the differences between the true and effective ( band - averaged ) extinction curves become smaller and smaller . since the b and u band fluxes only enter as weak upper limits on the progenitor",
    ", it is likely more correct to simply ignore the shifts at v band and longer wavelengths than to assume that an underlying @xmath27 extinction curve is globally transformed into a @xmath100 extinction curve . ] but allowing freedom in the extinction curve is certainly a more conservative approach .",

    "formally , the graphitic model is a better fit ( @xmath114 versus @xmath115 ) , but the models have essentially identical stellar luminosities , @xmath116 , and temperatures , @xmath117  k. both models marginally satisfy the mid - ir flux limits at this luminosity , with the graphitic models primarily limited by the non - detections at @xmath37 and @xmath38 m , and the silicate models limited by the contribution of silicate emission peak at @xmath36 m .    fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] illustrates all three of the basic points about circumstellar dust as compared to interstellar dust .",
    "first , the optical flux is completely dominated by the scattered emission that is not included in interstellar extinction laws .",
    "second , dust emission is quantitatively important to the k@xmath51 band flux . because the star is cold",
    ", dust emission does not dominate the near - ir flux as it would for a hot star of the same luminosity and degree of obscuration , but it does partly compensate for the absorption .",
    "third , there are quantitative differences between the two dust types in their balance between absorption and scattering and the nature of the mid - ir emission .",
    "the total optical depths of the models are quite different , @xmath118 for silicates and @xmath119 for graphite , but the effective absorption optical depths of the two models are very similar , with @xmath120 for silicates and @xmath121 for graphite .",
    "[ fig : dmodels ] shows the allowed parameter ranges for the stellar luminosity @xmath73 and visual extinction @xmath92 as a function of stellar temperature @xmath74 as compared to the results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we show the results for @xmath113  k , which roughly corresponds to the inner edge dust temperature if there was a dust forming wind at the time of the observations .",
    "table  [ tab : sedmodels ] gives the results for the other dust temperatures .",
    "they are generally similar except for the @xmath85  k graphitic model .",
    "the key issue for the progenitor is that the preferred solutions of both @xcite and @xcite significantly overestimate the luminosity of the progenitor .",
    "our results agree with @xcite on the temperature , but the luminosity @xmath73 is a factor of two lower .",
    "the mid - ir limits essentially preclude the higher luminosity and temperature solutions of @xcite unless the dust temperature is made significantly lower than @xmath122  k and the dust emission moves out of the irac band passes .",
    "even there , only the cold @xmath85  k graphitic model allows a significantly higher luminosity .",
    "as expected , a large part of the difference is that the models based on interstellar extinction are significantly overestimating the overall absorption .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue that the progenitor was probably the most massive yet found for a type  iip sn , probably at or above the upper limit of @xmath123 @xcite found in their statistical analysis of the masses of type  iip progenitors .",
    "given the amount of circumstellar extinction , this seemed to match the suggestion by @xcite that the upper mass limit could be biased by increasing levels of dust formation for the more massive red supergiants due to the increase in mass loss rates with luminosity . here",
    "we argue that many of these inferences are biased by incorrectly modeling circumstellar dust with an interstellar extinction law , thereby overestimating both the amount of extinction and the luminosity of the star . when we model the sed using circumstellar dust models , the luminosity of the star is @xmath124 and the mass is @xmath1 , where the downwards shifts are easily understood from the differing physics of interstellar and circumstellar extinction . the visual extinction is overestimated because interstellar extinction neglects the contributions of scattered light , and , to a lesser extent because of the low stellar temperature , the near - ir ( k@xmath51 ) extinction",
    "is overestimated by neglecting the emission from hot dust .",
    "the absence of a mid - ir source noted by @xcite is a key point of evidence , since there should have been a detectable source given the proposed , higher luminosities unless the dust is cold and emitting at longer wavelengths than the irac bands . in this particular case",
    ", the dust composition has little effect on the inferred properties of the star .",
    "unfortunately , without measuring the mid - ir portion of the sed we can not determine the dust temperature @xmath75 other than limiting it to be lower than the dust destruction temperature ( @xmath125  k ) . however , the wind properties are a strong function of the dust temperature because at fixed optical depth far more mass is required if the material is at larger radii and colder temperatures . ignoring the minor ( 10% ) corrections from the finite value of @xmath71 , the mass loss rate required to support the optical depth is @xmath126 where @xmath127  cm , @xmath128  km / s , @xmath129 and @xmath130  @xmath131/g .",

    "such fluctuations and trends are not unusual ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the x - ray emission appears to be broadly consistent with the presence of a wind with roughly the right density to explain the extinction of the progenitor . @xcite and @xcite report rising @xmath152  ghz radio fluxes of @xmath153 and @xmath154  mjy roughly 7 and 13 days after discovery that also argue for a significant wind at the time of the sn .",

    "the thompson optical depth of the wind is always negligible , since it is a small ( @xmath158 ) fraction of the dust optical depth , but the cold dust solutions would likely convert the sn into a type  iin because the h@xmath159 luminosity from recombination is of order @xmath160 and increases linearly with the distance to the circumstellar material .",
    "thus , while the data is fragmentary , the simplest interpretation appears to be that there was a relatively steady @xmath161 to @xmath162/year wind creating the obscuration at the time of the sn .    since the primary reason for inappropriately using galactic extinction laws for circumstellar dust is almost certainly their ease of use , we supply in table  [ tab : models ] equivalently easy to use models for absorption by circumstellar dust .",
    "the problem is somewhat more complex because the extinction depends on both wavelength and optical depth , but the absorption in the dusty models from the uv to mid / near - ir ( @xmath163 m to @xmath164 m ) can be well modeled by the functional form @xmath165 for optical depths up to @xmath166 . here",

    "these differences are quantitative rather than qualitative  in circumstellar dust models the progenitor of sn  2012aw is still fairly heavily obscured , as found by @xcite and @xcite , and @xcite are correct that circumstellar dust introduces a bias that must be modeled when considering the statistics of sn progenitors , particularly when modeling non - detections in analyses like @xcite .",
    "however , since changes in extinction physics exponentially modify quantities like luminosities , these differences between the two dust geometries are quantitatively important .",
    "we note , however , that sn where circumstellar dust will strongly bias inferences about the progenitor have densities of circumstellar material that will lead to x - ray or radio emission , as observed for sn  2012aw , because the optical depth is proportional to the wind density .",
    "for example , combining eqns .",
    "[ eqn : mdot ] and [ eqn : xlum ] , we see that the expected x - ray luminosity is @xmath175 .",
    "this means that the properties of the explosion can be used to constrain biases from dust around the progenitor even if the observations of the progenitor are inadequate to constrain the circumstellar extinction .",
    "there are , of course , additional complexities coming from the geometry of the dust around the star that can lead to differences in the effective optical depth along the line of sight for direct emission and averaged over a significant fraction of the shell for the scattered emission .",
    "our simple models provide two means of approximating some of these effects .",
    "first , changes in the shell thickness can be used to adjust the balance between scattered and absorbed light .",
    "second , the emergent flux can be modeled as a sum of direct light with one optical depth , and scattered light with another in order to model differences between the mean and line - of - sight optical depths . _",
    "independent of these questions , interstellar and circumstellar extinction are quantitatively different , and in this case ignoring the differences leads to a significant overestimate of the progenitor luminosity and mass . _    we thank j.  beacom , j.  eldridge , s.  smartt , k.z .",

    "<S> we use the progenitor of sn  2012aw to illustrate the consequences of modeling circumstellar dust using galactic ( interstellar ) extinction laws that ( 1 ) ignore dust emission in the near - ir and beyond ; ( 2 ) average over dust compositions , and ( 3 ) mis - characterize the optical / uv absorption by assuming that scattered photons are lost to the observer . the primary consequences for the progenitor of sn  2012aw are that both the luminosity and the absorption are significantly over - estimated . in particular , the stellar luminosity is most likely in the range @xmath0 and the star was not extremely massive for a type  iip progenitor , with @xmath1 . given the properties of the circumstellar dust and the early x - ray / radio detections of sn  2012aw , the star was probably obscured by an on - going wind with @xmath2 to @xmath3/year at the time of the explosion , roughly consistent with the expected mass loss rates for a star of its temperature ( @xmath4  k ) and luminosity . in the spirit of galactic extinction laws , we supply simple interpolation formulas for circumstellar extinction by dusty graphitic and silicate shells as a function of wavelength ( @xmath5 m ) and total ( absorption plus scattering ) v - band optical depth ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
