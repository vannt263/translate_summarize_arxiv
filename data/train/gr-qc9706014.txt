    ", the scalar - tensor theories can pass all the present experimental tests of gravitation . from a theoretical point of view , it has been pointed out that the scalar - tensor theories arise naturally as the low - energy limit of string theory  @xcite . until now",
    "almost all tests of high precision have been performed only in a weak field .",
    "it has been pointed out , however , by damour and esposito - farse  @xcite that there are considerable deviations of predictions in a strong field given by some viable scalar - tensor theories from those given by general relativity .    in the scalar - tensor theories of gravity , as in the case of general relativity , generation of gravitational waves is a typical phenomenon in a strong field and",
    "hence it is expected  @xcite that the projects ( ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , geo  @xcite and tama  @xcite ) of gravitational wave observations by laser interferometers will test the viable gravitational theories with high accuracy . unlike general relativity , there is a scalar mode in gravitational waves in the scalar - tensor theories .",
    "since this scalar gravitational wave can be detected by laser interferometers  @xcite or resonant mass antennas and can be separated from tensor modes , it has crucial importance with respect to the observational tests of the theories of gravity .",
    "the scalar gravitational waves from the oppenheimer - snyder collapse , i.e. , collapse of a spherically symmetric and homogeneous dust ball , have been calculated numerically as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where behavior of the scalar field within the dust , the observed wave form of the scalar gravitational waves , and its dependence on the value of the first derivative of the coupling function are examined . from the observed wave form of the scalar gravitational waves we can obtain information concerning the first derivative of the coupling function .",
    "the dependence of the observed wave form on the first derivative of the coupling function can be explained by stability analysis of the quasi - normal modes since the behavior of the scalar field under the outgoing wave condition before the formation of the horizon is characterized by the quasi - normal modes that satisfy the regularity condition at the center .",
    "the stability analysis is motivated by the gravitational test through pulsar - timing experiments . by measuring the change of the period of pulsation we can obtain information regarding scalar `` form factors '' of the pulsar , and those form factors",
    "are related to the variation of the moment of inertia under the influence of the companion star  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in some class of the scalar - tensor theories there is a solution with non - perturbative strong - field effects and it has form factors that are significantly different from those in general relativity  @xcite . in order to obtain the correct gravitational theory , it is important to investigate the internal structure of highly relativistic stars and check the consistency with the results observational tests .",
    "the stability analysis reveals whether the deviation of the stable equilibrium solution of the relativistic star from that in general relativity remains small or not .",
    "if , with some choice of the coupling function , the stable equilibrium solution suffers from non - perturbative effects by the coupling between the scalar field and matter and has significantly different scalar form factors from those in general relativity , the results of the pulsar - timing experiments will exclude that choice of the coupling function .",

    "therefore we conclude that each quasi - normal mode frequency @xmath81 varies smoothly with respect to @xmath80 .",
    "condition ( iv ) can be easily shown by observing that in the limit @xmath96 , the solution regular at the origin is not a purely outgoing wave .",

    "we define a critical value @xmath97 as a value of @xmath32 such that for @xmath98 there is no unstable mode and for @xmath99 there is an unstable mode .",
