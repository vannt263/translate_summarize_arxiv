    "( iii ) some progress has been made when @xmath14 is the 3-torus @xmath18 , see @xcite for cyclic case and @xcite for general case . in ( i ) and ( iii ) , to determine those maximum orders for concrete genera are still not solved .",
    "surfaces belong to the most familiar topological subjects mostly because they can be seen staying in the 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 in various manners .",
    "the symmetries of surfaces which can be embedded into the symmetries of @xmath0 are easier to feel by intuition",
    ". hence it will be more natural to wonder the maximum orders of finite group actions on surfaces which extend over the 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", we will study this maximum order problem for all compact ( closed / bordered ) surfaces with given ( geometric / algebraic ) genera .",
    "to state our results , we need some notions and definitions .",
    "we always assume that the manifolds , embeddings and group actions are smooth , and the group actions on @xmath0 are faithful . let @xmath19 denote the isometry group of the unit sphere in the 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 , and let @xmath20 denote the orientation - preserving isometry group of the unit sphere in @xmath0 .",
    "it is known that any finite group @xmath21 acting on @xmath0 can be conjugated into @xmath19 , especially it can be conjugated into @xmath20 if the @xmath21 action is orientation - preserving , see @xcite and @xcite .",

    "if a group @xmath21 acts on @xmath5 and @xmath0 such that @xmath23 for each @xmath24 and the @xmath21-action on @xmath0 can be conjugated into @xmath19 , then we call such a group action on @xmath5 _ extendable _ over @xmath0 with respect to @xmath25 .    for simplicity",
    ", we will say ",
    "@xmath21 acts on the pair @xmath26 \" in the sense of this definition .    an orthogonal action on @xmath27 fixes @xmath28 and extends orthogonally to @xmath29 acting trivially on the new coordinate , so it fixes pointwise a line in @xmath29 through @xmath28 and restricts to an orthogonal action on @xmath30 with a fixed point .",
    "vice versa , an orthogonal action on @xmath17 with a fixed point @xmath31 acts orthogonally on @xmath29 , fixes @xmath28 and @xmath31 and pointwise the line in @xmath29 through @xmath28 and @xmath31 , and hence restricts to an orthogonal action on the @xmath27 orthogonal to this line .",
    "so the actions on @xmath32 with at least one fixed point are the same as the actions on @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the orientable compact surface with genus @xmath4 and @xmath34 boundary components , and for @xmath35 let @xmath36 denote the non - orientable compact surface with genus @xmath4 and @xmath34 boundary components .",

    "suppose that @xmath21 acts on @xmath1 realizing the maximum order , then the @xmath21-action is orientation - reversing . hence the orientation - preserving elements of @xmath21 form an index @xmath98 subgroup @xmath97 .",
    "let @xmath478 and @xmath479 .",
    "then the @xmath21-action induces an orientation - reversing @xmath103-action on @xmath220 . by the proof of theorem [ ea](1 ) , @xmath480 , the singular set of @xmath220 consists of @xmath194 half lines , and the induced @xmath103-action is a reflection on @xmath481 .",
    "the reflection plane @xmath482 contains the singular set of @xmath220 , as the left picture of figure [ fig : reflection plane ] .    by the proof of theorem [ ea](1 ) , there are two possibilities : case ( a ) and case ( b ) . in case",
    "( b ) , the reflection boundary arc of @xmath81 lies on @xmath482 , hence the whole @xmath81 lies on @xmath482 .",
    "this is a contradiction since @xmath81 also contains a singular point in the interior of @xmath107 . in case ( a )",
    ", @xmath81 has @xmath98 singular points which lie on @xmath482 . since @xmath81 can not lie on @xmath482 , it must intersect @xmath482 transversely along an arc passing the two singular points , as the right picture of figure [ fig : reflection plane ] . if the two singular points lie on the same singular line , then the preimage of @xmath81 can not be connected ( comparing with the last paragraph of the proof of theorem [ e ] ) .",
    "hence ( vii ) in the proof of theorem [ ea](1 ) does not happen .",
    "then the singular points of @xmath81 lie on different singular lines , and the order of @xmath410 in the proof of theorem [ ea](1 ) will be the same as the index of the singular line of @xmath220 which does not intersect @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath5 must be a punctured sphere .",

    "we can define extendable group actions on graphs like the case of compact bordered surfaces , and define the maximum orders @xmath483 , @xmath484 , @xmath485 , @xmath486 similarly .",
