    "in the galactic halo we observe a population of very metal - poor stars ( vmp , @xmath2\\lesssim-2.0 $ ] ) that are the relics of the early phase of star formation in our galaxy . a fraction between @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the observed vmp stars",
    "are enriched in carbon ( e.g. marsteller  , @xcite ; frebel  , @xcite ; lucatello  , @xcite ) . among these carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars ( cemp , herein defined by @xmath5\\ge+1.0 $ ] ) , approximately @xmath6 are also enriched in heavy elements produced by slow ( @xmath7 ) and rapid ( @xmath8 ) neutron - capture processes ( aoki  , @xcite ) .",
    "cemp-@xmath0 stars are normally defined by the barium excess , namely @xmath9 \\ge + 1.0 $ ] .",
    "cemp-@xmath0 stars are often found in binary systems : by analysing a sample of cemp-@xmath0 stars lucatello  ( @xcite ) detected radial velocity variations in a fraction of stars statistically consistent with the hypothesis that all cemp-@xmath0 stars are in binary systems .",
    "this evidence suggests that the origin of the peculiar abundances in cemp-@xmath0 stars is due to mass transfer of carbon - rich material occurred in the past from an evolved primary star in the thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase . according to this interpretation",
    ", the study of cemp-@xmath0 stars provides us with a powerful tool to probe agb nucleosynthesis at low metallicity .",
    "many cemp-@xmath0 stars have hardly evolved since their formation and therefore the observed surface abundances are the fingerprint of the nucleosynthesis that occurred in their agb companions .",
    "a correct understanding of cemp-@xmath0 stars allows us to enlighten many different aspects of the agb evolution at low metallicity that are poorly constrained , such as the physics of mixing , the mass - loss processes and the effects of binary interaction for example on the mass - accretion rate .",
    "the agb is the final stage in the life of stars with initial mass between about @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "an agb star is characterised by two nuclear - burning shells , the innermost one burning helium ( he ) in unstable flashes above a degenerate carbon - oxygen core , and the other one burning hydrogen ( h ) below the convective envelope .",
    "when the he shell is active , the energy produced expands the outer layers and , as an effect of the reduced density , nuclear burning is estinguished in the h shell . at this stage",
    "the inner edge of the convective envelope can move inward ( in mass ) and mix to the surface the products of internal nucleosynthesis ( herwig , @xcite ) , a process known as third dredge - up ( tdu ) .",
    "the @xmath0-process occurs in the intershell region between the two burning shells , where he is abundant and ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) reactions can be efficiently activated to produce free neutrons , which are subsequently captured by the iron seeds to form @xmath0-elements .",
    "people usually define three peaks of @xmath0-elements that correspond to particularly stable atomic nuclei : the light-@xmath0 peak ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , the heavy-@xmath0 peak ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , and the peak of lead ( @xmath19 ) . similarly to a system of three buckets of increasing sizes , each one containing the smaller ones and being contained in the larger , where to fill the largest bucket it is necessary to fill the smaller ones first , in an analogous way the @xmath0-process populates the three peaks progressively .",
    "when a small amount of free neutrons is available , the first @xmath0-elements to be produced are those in the light-@xmath0 peak .",
    "as soon as more free neutrons are available , the light-@xmath0 peak is filled and the heavy-@xmath0 elements are produced .",
    "when the density of free neutrons increases further also @xmath20 is produced .",
    "the neutron source and the timescale for neutron production determine the density of free neutrons and ultimately the resulting @xmath0-process element distribution . for a star of mass up to @xmath21",
    "the main source of free neutrons is the @xmath22 reaction ( cameron , @xcite ) .",
    "a sufficient abundance of @xmath23 is produced in the intershell region when protons are captured by @xmath24 to form a layer rich in @xmath23 and @xmath25 ( straniero , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , to allow the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0-elements , a mechanism is required that brings protons in the intershell region below the h - burning shell . during the tdu protons from the h - rich surface",
    "are mixed throughout the entire envelope . at the interface with the deepest extent of the convective envelope ,",
    "some protons are mixed with the top layer of the intershell region .",
    "the details about the size in mass of this `` partial mixing zone '' ( pmz ) and the physical process that creates the pmz are still unknown , although several mechanisms have been proposed , such as convective overshoot , rotation and gravity waves ( herwig , @xcite ; busso  @xcite ) .    in the models computed by karakas ( @xcite ) ,",
    "protons are mixed into the intershell region by artificially adding the pmz at the deepest extent of each tdu . for a given stellar mass the distribution of @xmath0-elements",
    "is determined by the mass of the pmz , @xmath26 , because the larger the pmz , the more free neutrons per iron seed are produced in the intershell .",
    "karakas ( @xcite ) and lugaro  ( @xcite ) explore the effect of different @xmath26 on the nucleosynthesis products of agb stars of different initial mass .",
    "in this work we used the binary evolution model described by izzard   ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) with the updates on the algorithm for the wind mass transfer described by abate   ( @xcite ) . in this model",
    "we implemented the intershell abundances derived by karakas ( @xcite ) and we simulated a grid of binary stars at metallicity @xmath27 ( @xmath2\\approx-2.3 $ ] ) where the initial parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , separation and @xmath26 vary in the ranges @xmath30\\ , { \\mathrm{m}_{\\odot}}$ ] , @xmath31\\,{\\mathrm{m}_{\\odot}}$ ] , @xmath32\\,{\\mathrm{r}_{\\odot}}$ ] and @xmath33\\,{\\mathrm{m}_{\\odot}}$ ] , respectively ( details are provided in our forthcoming paper , abate  , @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to reproduce the chemical abundances observed in a sample of 60 cemp-@xmath0 stars selected from the saga database of metal - poor stellar abundances ( suda  @xcite ; @xcite ) and , in this way , to probe the models of agb nucleosynthesis .",
    "for each cemp-@xmath0 star of our sample we found the modelled star that matches best the observed chemical abundances by minimising the value of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively the observed and modelled abundance of the element @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the observed error .",
    "to calculate @xmath39 we only used the elements that are affected by agb nucleosynthesis , such as c , n , o , f , na , mg and neutron - capture elements . as an additional constraint , we imposed that the surface gravity of our modelled star reproduces the observed value within the error .",

    "an example of a good match between model and observations is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] , where the black points are the elements affected by agb nucleosynthesis , the grey points are the other elements and the solid line is our model . for the stars in the other third of our sample we are not able to determine a model that reproduces all the elements simultaneously . in many of these stars ,",
    "the abundance of light-@xmath0 elements is low , while heavy-@xmath0 are strongly enhanced ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] , right ) .",
    "this condition is hard to reproduce in our models , because in the @xmath0-process the star needs to populate the light-@xmath0 peak first before it produces heavy-@xmath0 elements or pb .",
    "one interpretation of this discrepancy is that our parametrization of the pmz can not fully take into account all the details of the @xmath0-process in agb stars .",
    "further work is required to investigate if a time dependence of @xmath26 , or a non - linear mass profile of the h abundance in the pmz , could lead to a better match between models and observations in all the cemp-@xmath0 stars of our sample .    in summary",
