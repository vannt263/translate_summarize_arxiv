    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) @xcite is based on conserved @xmath0-parity , where @xmath0-parity ( @xmath4 ) @xcite is defined as @xmath5 and originally guaranteed the stability of the proton in supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "it implies on the one hand a stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and predicts on the other hand zero neutrino masses as in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "as neutrino oscillation experiments have shown at least two neutrinos have non - zero mass @xcite requiring an extension to explain neutrino data .    in the sm",
    "exist various ways to explain neutrino data , e.g.postulating very heavy particles as in the seesaw mechanism @xcite resulting in a unique dimension-5 operator @xcite or via loop - effects @xcite .",
    "although all mentioned solutions can be supersymmetrized , there exists an entirely supersymmetric possibility to generate majorana neutrino masses , namely @xmath0-parity violation @xcite .",
    "allowing for all possible gauge- and supersymmetric invariant terms within the mssm particle content , @xmath0-parity can be broken by bilinear or trilinear terms @xcite .",
    "trilinear models provide a huge number of free parameters , where different attempts tried to reduce them @xcite .",
    "spontaneous @xmath0-parity violation can be understood as a violation of lepton number by the vacuum expectation value of some singlet field @xcite .",
    "bilinear can be interpreted as the low - energy limit of some spontaneous model , where the new singlet fields are all decoupled .",
    "the bilinear model has only six new parameters and is thus more predictive in particular in view of collider physics once the parameters have been chosen to explain correctly neutrino data . for an early work on bilinear @xmath0-parity violation in the context of a low - energy",
    "effective theory we refer to @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of susy has been studied extensively in the past , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "neutrino masses have been calculated with trilinear couplings @xcite and for pure bilinear models @xcite or both @xcite .",
    "neutrino angles are not predicted in either schemes , but can be easily fitted to experimental data . in bilinear schemes",
    "the requirement to correctly explain neutrino data fixes all couplings in sufficiently small intervals , so that in some specific final states of the decays of the lsp correlations with neutrino angles appear .",
    "this has been shown for a ( bino - dominated ) neutralino lsp in @xcite , for charged scalar lsps in @xcite , for sneutrino lsps in @xcite , and for chargino , gluino and squark lsps in @xcite .",
    "such a tight connection between neutrino physics and lsp decays is lost to some extent in the general trilinear - plus - bilinear case .",
    "the @xmath6-problem of the mssm @xcite is induced by the mass term for the higgs superfields @xmath7 . for phenomenological reasons the parameter @xmath6 must be of the order of the electroweak scale .",
    "however , if there is a larger scale in the theory , the natural value of @xmath6 should be around this large scale . a solution to this problem",
    "can be provided by the next - to - minimal ssm ( nmssm ) @xcite , where an additional singlet superfield is introduced .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of its scalar component generates an effective @xmath6 term as soon as electroweak symmetry is broken .",
    "the phenomenology has been discussed for example in @xcite .",
    "electroweak mass corrections were discussed in @xcite , an on - shell scheme for neutralino and chargino masses including the discussion of the two - body decays @xmath8 at one - loop level was worked out in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1ssm , which was first proposed in @xcite , uses the same singlet superfield(s ) not only to generate the @xmath6 term but in addition dirac mass terms for the left - handed neutrinos .",
    "the cubic self - couplings of the singlets in the superpotential explicitly break lepton number and moreover also @xmath4 .",
    "thus , majorana neutrino masses are generated once electroweak symmetry is broken .",
    "one - loop corrections to the neutrino mass matrix have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "compared to the nmssm the @xmath1ssm with one right - handed neutrino superfield also contains six new parameters , the same number as going from the mssm to the bilinear model as will be discussed in detail later on .",
    "this implies that one also obtains correlations between neutrino mixing angles and ratios of lsp decay branching ratios @xcite .",
    "moreover , one has unusual decay modes and signatures in the higgs sector @xcite .",
    "although one expects correlations between neutrino mixing angles and final states of the lsp decays at tree level , it is a priori unclear what happens at one - loop level . in particular using one - loop on - shell masses and the one - loop mixing matrix together with the tree level decay widths results in case of the @xmath1ssm with one right - handed neutrino superfield in an unexpected behavior :",
    "the expected correlation does not necessarily show up for a singlino - like lsp .",
    "therefore , we present in this paper a full one - loop calculation for the decays @xmath3 and show how the tree level expectations evolve at full one - loop level . for this aim",
    "we extend the on - shell scheme presented in @xcite for the decays @xmath9 within the mssm and the nmssm to the models considered here .",
    "moreover , we briefly discuss the implementation of these decays in cnndecays @xcite .",
    "note that in case of the @xmath1ssm with more than one right - handed neutrino superfield similar problems do not show up .",
    "the reason is , that neutrino physics can be fully explained at tree level and thus at the same level of perturbation theory as the correlations with the neutralino branching ratios .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first define our models in section  [ sec : modeldefinition ] . in section  [ sec : theoryoneloopmasses ] we present our on - shell scheme for the neutralino and chargino mass matrices in the considered models .",
    "afterwards we present numerical results for the neutrino masses and mixings comparing the on - shell scheme and the @xmath2 scheme in section  [ sec : practiceoneloopmasses ] .",
    "next we discuss the decays @xmath3 and the correlations to neutrino physics at tree level in section  [ sec : treelevelwidth ] . in section  [ sec : oneloopwidth ]",
    "we first discuss the complete nlo corrections to the widths and discuss the correlations at one - loop level .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "we will start with the superpotential of bilinear @xmath0-parity violation ( brpv ) and the @xmath1ssm with one right - handed neutrino superfield  @xmath10 .",

    "if not the first term in equation   explicitly breaks lepton number and one immediately sees that in both models one has the same number of violating parameters .",
    "note that for the phenomenology it does not matter if @xmath19 carries lepton number as it is broken explicitly by a least one interaction of this field .",

    "we will therefore consider the complete mass matrices at the one - loop level using an on - shell scheme for calculating the masses .",

    "the approach is similar to @xcite , whereas for the mssm another procedure has been worked out in @xcite .",

    "however , the lepton yukawa couplings @xmath114 and thus @xmath112 can be chosen diagonal at tree level .",
    "using now the relations @xmath115 and @xmath116 one can do a simple expansion in first order of @xmath117 and @xmath118 : @xmath119 therefore the counterterm of @xmath104 can be expressed as a function of @xmath120 and @xmath117 : @xmath121 the variation of all non - zero entries of the tree level mass matrix yields : @xmath122 whereas all the other variations @xmath123 necessarily vanish .",

    "similar to the ( n)mssm we fix @xmath126 in the neutralino and @xmath127 in the chargino sector .",
    "however , we still have to find appropriate renormalization conditions for @xmath128 and @xmath113 . whereas @xmath113 should be fixed in the lepton sector ,",
    "so that one - loop contributions to leptonic two - point functions vanish , we have several possibilities for @xmath120 and @xmath129 .",
    "whereas @xmath120 could for example be fixed in the higgs sector together with @xmath101 , one could fix @xmath130 with respect to an @xmath0-parity violating decay .",
    "we will focus on stable lepton masses .",
    "thus , we calculate @xmath118 and @xmath130 from the one - loop contributions in the chargino sector , which mix the well - known mssm charginos with the leptons . in total",
    "we therefore impose the following conditions for the mssm parameters @xmath131 which results in @xmath132 in a second step the conditions @xmath133 for the renormalization constants of the lepton masses @xmath113 are imposed , resulting in @xmath134 in a last step the @xmath0-parity violating sector with @xmath118 and @xmath130 is considered , which can be fixed by imposing @xmath135 @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the levi - civita symbol and det@xmath138 is the determinant of the lepton masses . in case of vanishing non - diagonal lepton masses at tree level @xmath139 for @xmath140 this simplifies to @xmath141 .",
    "another possibility is to fix @xmath118 from @xmath142 .",
    "however , this induces a dependence on the renormalization constants of the gauge sector , whereas in the described case the neutrino and lepton sector are `` decoupled '' from those .",
    "for all the remaining entries of the neutralino and chargino mass matrices shifts @xmath143 have to be taken into account . due to the non - vanishing entries",
    "@xmath142 also the lepton masses differ between tree and one - loop level .",
    "however , we will show that this difference is tiny , for reasonable neutrino masses far below the experimental uncertainties .",
    "note that the yukawa couplings of the leptons at tree level of course have to be adopted , so that the tree level lepton masses fit the experimental known values .",
    "combining the already known procedures from the nmssm and brpv we define @xmath144 in this notation the tree level mass matrix of the neutralinos is given by @xmath145 where @xmath104 is defined in equation   and the chargino mass matrix has the same form as in brpv , see equation  .",
