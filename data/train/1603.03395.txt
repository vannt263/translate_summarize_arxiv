    "the present paper describes an attempt of a generic study of several problems that are now classical : perforated tube mufflers without @xcite or with partitions @xcite",

    "related problems are tubes with branched resonators , which can be uncoupled @xcite or coupled @xcite , or with honeycomb cavities @xcite .",
    "other kind of systems are splitter silencers with perforated facing @xcite .",
    "this generic problem is that of a periodic lattice of two waveguides coupled by perforations .    assuming low frequencies , only one mode is considered in each guide , therefore the system in study is a system with two coupled modes .",
    "the propagation in the two waveguides can be very different , thanks to the presence of constrictions , diaphragms , porous material , partitions or other type of obstacles ( see figure [ fig : sectional - view - of ] ) . following sullivan @xcite , we use a discrete , periodic model based on 4th - order transfer matrices .",
    "however the product of these transfer matrices can lead to diverging products when evanescent modes are present , and this can be avoided by combining a decoupling approach , i.e. , a diagonalization , and then the transformation of a transfer matrix into an impedance matrix for the finite - length lattice .",
    "the decoupling approach was used also in a continuous modeling ( @xcite , see also @xcite p 356 ) .",

    "thanks to a discrete model , the diagonalization of 4th - order transfer matrices can be found analytically , by using the partition of these matrices into 2nd - order matrices .",
    "the study of the coupling between two guides especially involves an analysis of the local or non - local character of the coupling .",
    "generally speaking , coupling is obviously strong when the perforations are wide , but also when propagation in the two guides is rather similar ( i.e. , the two propagation constants are close ) .",
    "this analysis is done for lattices of finite length , focusing on the behaviour relationships between the insertion loss coefficient and the dispersion curves and frequency bands .",
    "a major difficulty is the modeling of the perforations .",
    "semi - empirical formulas are generally used @xcite , especially when there is a mean flow .",
    "one focus of the present paper is on the role of the series impedance of the perforation @xcite , which can be ignored in a continuous model , but not in a discrete model .",
    "a priori this impedance , due to the anti - symmetric field in the perforation , must be accounted for the case of wide and well spaced perforations . to our knowledge ,",
    "no paper used the complete model found in the paper published in 1994 @xcite .",
    "however for a similar problem in musical acoustics , the effect of the series impedance of tone - holes of woodwind instruments , can be significant @xcite .",
    "the values of the perforation shunt admittance and series impedance are not discussed in detail in this paper , but the values given in @xcite are sufficient for a discussion ( exact values were given for the 2d , rectangular case at low frequencies , but for the cylindrical case , only approximate formulas were proposed ) .",
    "several papers are concerned with more general systems with more than two guides , or with 2d silencers , in particular for applications to metamaterials @xcite .",
    "they are not discussed here . concerning a general view on 1d periodic structures ,",
    "we refer to classical references @xcite .",
    "the assumptions are as follows : linear acoustics , no mean flow , rigid walls .",

    "the impedance matrix is derived by using the calculation of the transfer matrix calculated given in appendix [ sec : appendix :- transfer - matrix ] .",
    "finally the insertion loss of the lattice into an infinite waveguide is derived .",
    "section [ iii ] proposes a theoretical analysis of the coupling between the two guides , focusing on the effect of the series impedance ; on a definition of a coupling coefficient ; and on a derivation of a condition for a local reaction . finally numerical simulations of application examples are presented in section [ sec : applications ] , with an analysis of the insertion loss with respect to the nature of the two modes .",
    "the two guides are coupled by perforation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transfer - matrix - symmetrical - and1 ] . when their cross section is uniform , the waves are planar at an axial distance from perforations larger that the transverse dimensions , so that the evanescent modes due to perforations vanish .",
    "when the cross section is not uniform , the change in cross - section area needs to be sufficiently far from the perforation , i.e. , at an axial distance larger than the transverse dimension .",
    "the propagation in the guides is characterized by the effective density @xmath1 and the speed of sound @xmath2 ( the subscript @xmath3 @xmath4 ) .",
    "the change in cross section allows various situations to be created , as shown in figure [ fig : three - cases ] . when the propagation is identical is the two guides , the lattice is homogeneous , while when diaphragms are present in one guide only , the lattice is non - homogeneous .",

    "the complete transfer matrix of an asymmetric cell ( see fig.[fig : transfer - matrix - symmetrical - and1 ] ) can be characterized by the equation : @xmath32 the case of a symmetric cell is more particular , but remains very general .",

    "for such a cell , between abscissas @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the transfer matrix relationship is given by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , defined in equation ( [ eq : e1 ] ) , is considered at mid - distance ( abscissa @xmath10 ) between two perforations .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath35  ( equation ( [ eq : e5 ] ) ) describing the uncoupled propagation over distance @xmath31 between two neighboring perforations is therefore the product of the two transfer matrices : @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( resp.@xmath38 ) describes the uncoupled propagation over the distance @xmath8 situated on the left ( resp .",

    "thanks to equation ( [ eq : jkp ] ) , general solutions @xmath86 and @xmath87 , for the two modes @xmath59 and @xmath70 of the lattice can be written explicitly .",
    "reciprocity is related to the choice of matrices @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , with a determinant equal to unity . in order to find the consequences on the eigenvectors of a cell",
    ", we start from the classical reciprocity equation valid for guides without flow .",
    "we write it on the surface @xmath91 of a cell ( e.g. , a symmetric cell ) : @xmath92 the superscripts @xmath3 and @xmath93 correspond to two different situations .",
    "for instance two situations where only one eigenmode exists can be chosen .",
    "the integral vanishes on all rigid walls , therefore it is limited to the input and output of a cell .",
    "the term in parenthesis in equation ( [ 500 ] ) is the same for the output surface and the input surface , apart from the factor @xmath94 therefore it is possible to factorize the term @xmath95 $ ] , and for the eigenmodes corresponding to @xmath59 and @xmath96 , equation ( [ 500 ] ) is trivial because this term vanishes .",
    "it remains to solve the following equation : @xmath97 for the modes corresponding to @xmath59 and @xmath98 , and to @xmath59 and @xmath99 . using the expressions ( [ 356 ] ) of the eigenvectors ,",
    "the following equations are obtained : @xmath100 a direct checking of these equations is heavy .",
    "reciprocity implies also the symmetry of the impedance matrix , as shown in section [ sub : impedance - matrix - for ] .      up to now",
    "the considered lattice is can be lossy , when one of the coefficients defining a cell is complex . for lossless waveguides , several types of waves can exist @xcite .",
    "when reciprocity holds , each of the two modes with propagation constant @xmath59 and @xmath98 can be either propagating or evanescent . in the case of two evanescent waves",
    "the possibility for the propagation constant to be complex was found : the energy flux in each guide decreases exponentially , but is not zero ( its sign is opposite in the two guides , ensuring the energy conservation ) .    ref .",
    "@xcite studied the particular case of an homogenous lattice , i.e. , a lattice with identical transfer matrices @xmath45 in the two guides .",
    "this happens for example when the guides are straight guides with the same sound speed and density . in this case",
    ", there is at least one propagating wave , and the decomposition of the propagation into two modes ( one is planar , the other one is called the `` flute '' mode ) is valid even for a lattice with irregular perforations .",
    "the cut - off frequencies are given by @xmath101 , i.e. , @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , according to equations ( [ eq : e33 ] ) , @xmath104 , and the dispersion equation ( [ jk4 - 1 ] ) implies either @xmath105 or @xmath106 writing @xmath107 in equation ( [ eq : e33 ] ) , and using equations ( [ jk9],[jk99 ] ) with the property @xmath108 , the cut - off frequencies are given by one of the four following equations : @xmath109 the characteristic impedances of the two guides , @xmath110 ( see equations.([jk98],[jk97 ] ) , are found to be either infinite ou zero .",
    "it is interesting to interpret these results .",
    "consider the example of equation ( [ jk26 ] ) . because @xmath102 , for an infinite lattice , @xmath111 in each guide , and because the characteristic impedance is infinite , the velocity vanishes at the extremities of the cell .",
    "consequently , if there is a opening at the extremity of the cell , this cut - off does not depend on the opening .",
    "it can be checked that this equation gives the eigenfrequency of the cell when it is closed at their extremities ( infinite impedance ) .",
    "the second and the third terms of equation ( [ jk26 ] ) correspond to the impedance in guide 1 and 2 , respectively , at the abscissa of the perforation , calculated by projecting the infinite impedance at the end of the cell to the perforation abscissa .",
    "moreover the pressure field in the cell being symmetrical , the series impedance @xmath24 does not intervene .",
    "similar interpretation can be done for the three other equations , using the duality pressure / velocity .",
    "in order to derive the ( _ acoustic _ ) impedance matrix of a lattice of @xmath0 cells , the vector @xmath14 ( equation ( [ eq : e1 ] ) ) is replaced by a vector @xmath112 defined as follows : @xmath113 where @xmath114 ( @xmath28 are the flow rates . in appendix",
