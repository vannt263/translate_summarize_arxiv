    "blobs ( labs ) are a new category of high redshift galaxies , which have been recently discovered .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found two bright blobs ( blob 1 and blob 2 ) in the ssa22 field , which have sizes of @xmath5 kpc and luminosities of @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 at @xmath6 .",
    "these labs are associated with previously known lyman ",
    "break galaxies ( lbgs ) at redshift @xmath7 . compared to typical emitters found at high redshifts ( dey et al .",

    "2004 ) , labs are more luminous and much more extended .",
    "labs resemble the giant nebulae associated with high  redshift radio galaxies , although the associated radio continuum flux is less than 1% .",
    "recently , matsuda et al . (",
    "2004 ) have found 35 candidates for labs in the ssa22 field .",
    "one third of them are apparently not associated with uv continuum sources that are bright enough to produce emission .",
    "therefore , the origin of labs is mysterious .",
    "so far , three possibilities have been proposed as models for labs .",
    "the first is heavily  obscured uv sources like an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) or starburst ( steidel et al . 2000 ; chapman et al . 2004 ) .",
    "chapman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argue that the multiwavelength observations of blob 1 is at least consistent with a dust  enshrouded agn surrounded by a starburst .",
    "the second is a cooling radiation model ( haiman , spaans , & quataert 2000 ; fardal et al .",
    "2001 ) . in a bottom",
    " up scenario of galaxy formation , a large number of subgalactic halos are expected to collapse at high redshifts and they can emit significant fluxes through collisional excitation of hydrogen .",
    "thus , the cooling radiation from proto  galaxies have been advocated to be a possible mechanism for observed emission of labs .",
    "the last is a superwind model ( taniguchi & shioya 2000 ; ohyama et al .",
    "taniguchi & shioya ( 2000 ) have argued that a large  scale bipolar outflow driven by the starburst in a forming galaxy can be responsible for the intensive emission of labs .",
    "the deep optical spectroscopy of labs suggests that the kinematical properties of labs favor supernova ( sn ) driven winds ( ohyama et al .",
    "interestingly , matsuda et al . (",
    "2004 ) have recently revealed bubbly features in blobs 1 and 2 , where the bubble size is typically @xmath8kpc .",
    "the bubbly structures strongly suggest that sn events could be closely related to labs .",
    "therefore , complexes of various superbubbles , which can be driven by multiple sne , are an attractive explanation for labs .",
    "however , it has not been shown whether multiple sn explosions can actually produce the observed lab emission . in this letter , we attempt to build up a multiple sn explosion model for labs . for the purpose , we perform an ultra  high resolution ( @xmath0 grids ) simulation on the sn explosions in inhomogeneous and multiphase interstellar matter ( ism ) , where individual sn remnants are resolved .",
    "the results of this chemodynamical simulation , incorporating spectro  photometric modeling ( see mori et al .",
    "1997 and mori , yoshii & nomoto 1999 ) , can be directly compared to the observations on blobs . in  2 , the numerical model is described . in  3 , we present the numerical results and in  4 the early chemical evolution of the system is discussed .",
    "we define a fiducial model for a blob at redshift @xmath9 , in which the total mass of gaseous matter is initially assumed to be @xmath10 , and the total mass including dark matter halo is @xmath11 .",
    "the baryonic matter to dark matter halo has been increased by a factor @xmath12 with respect to the cosmological valuecdm cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , a hubble constant of @xmath15  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "] , to account for possible bias effects in rapidly cooling regions .",
    "according to the general picture of bottom  up scenarios for galaxy formation , we model a protogalaxy as an assemblage of numerous subgalactic condensations building up the total mass of a galaxy . as for the surface density profiles of the blobs",
    ", the galaxy as a whole is modelled as a pre ",
    "virialized system with a spherically  averaged density profile @xmath18 in a radius of 106  kpc , where @xmath19 is a nfw density profile , @xmath20 ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) .",
    "subgalactic condensations having a zero velocity are then distributed to such a profile by monte ",
    "carlo realization .",
    "these are taken as already virialized systems with a nfw density profile encompassing a mass of @xmath21 in a virial radius @xmath22 kpc .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) is assumed to be proportional to the total gas mass .",
    "the sfr integrated over the whole system is @xmath23 with the time scale @xmath24 . because of the short timescale of our simulation , the sfr is essentially constant @xmath25 which is inferred from observations of bright lbgs at @xmath26 ( shapley et al .",
    "thus , the ambiguity of @xmath27 has little serious problem .",
    "the mass of individual stars and the formation epoch are determined by randomly sampling both @xmath28 and the initial mass function ( imf ) , which is assumed to be of salpeter type with upper and lower mass cutoffs of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the newly born stars are distributed in proportion to the gas density using a monte - carlo procedure . a star more massive than @xmath31",
    "is assumed , after the main sequence lifetime , to undergo a type ii sn explosion , releasing a total energy of @xmath32 erg .",
    "a mass of @xmath33 of oxygen and of @xmath34 of iron are ejected from a type ii sn explosion ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the present simulation",
    ", a total of @xmath35 sn explosions occur in the whole galaxy ; we focus on the first 50  myr of the chemodynamical evolution of the system .",
    "the gas dynamics is solved in three  dimensional space with @xmath0 cartesian grids . here",
    ", we employ the ausm  dv scheme ( wada & liou 1994 ) , which is a tvd scheme that can resolve the shock accurately .",
    "the spatial resolution is 195 pc and the simulation box has a ( physical ) size of 212  kpc .",
    "the ejected energy and well - mixed metals by sn are supplied to 8 local cells surrounding sn region .",
    "then , the hydrodynamic evolution of metals is followed by the same algorithm as the gas density .",
    "since the time variation of dark matter halo potential is insignificant in the early stage of galaxy evolution , we assume the gravitational potential to be constant in time .",
    "also , the gas is assumed to be optically thin and in collisional  ionization equilibrium .",
    "radiative cooling is included self  consistently with matallicity , using the metallicity  dependent cooling curves by sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) .",
    "the set of basic equations are numerically solved by a parallel version of the astrophysical fluid dynamics ( afd2 ) scheme ( see mori , ferrara & madau 2002 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the numerical results at 50  myr .",
    "figures 1a and 1c show the density and temperature distributions in a slice along the @xmath36 plane , respectively .",
    "after the first massive stars explode , the gas temperature is raised up to about @xmath37 k locally , and expanding hot bubbles of @xmath38kpc are produced .",
    "then , the strong shock drives cooled , dense shells enclosing hot bubbles .",
    "subsequent sn explosions further accelerate the expansion of hot bubbles and the ambient gas is continuously swept up by the dense shells ; the gas density in shells increases further owing to the enhanced cooling . since the density of ism is low in outer regions , the bubble expansion is faster there and sn  driven shock waves quickly collide with each other to generate larger bubbles of @xmath3810kpc , which are surrounded by high  density ( @xmath39 @xmath40 ) , cool ( @xmath41 k ) shells .",
    "we compute the emission properties of the galaxy assuming an optically thin gas in collisional ionization equilibrium and using the mappingsiii code by sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) .",
    "ly@xmath42 extinction due to",
    "dust seems negligible . for the average gas column density , @xmath43  @xmath44 , and metallicity in the simulation ( shown below )",
    ", we have @xmath45 } = 3.06\\times 10^{-3}$ ] .",
    "then , using equation ( 20 ) of pei ( 1992 ) and @xmath46 , we find @xmath47 .",
    "figures 1e and 1f show the projected distribution of the resultant emission and x  ray emission in the 0.22 kev band ( 0.88 kev at @xmath9 ) , where one arcsec corresponds to 8kpc .",
    "it is worth noting that small bubbles with a few kpc are smeared out in the surface brightness of emission and bubbly features of @xmath48kpc are prominent in outer regions .",
    "such features are quite similar to the bubbly structures observed in blobs 1 and 2 ( matsuda et al 2004 ) .",
    "the total flux of emission is @xmath49 erg  s@xmath2 @xmath44 and the corresponding luminosity is @xmath50 erg  s@xmath2 , which comes mainly from high  density cooling shells .",
    "this luminosity is also comparable to @xmath1 erg  s@xmath2 of blobs 1 and 2 .",
    "these results suggest that labs could be an early phase of chemical evolution in a protogalaxy . the total flux of x  ray emission is @xmath51 erg s@xmath2 @xmath44 and the corresponding luminosity is @xmath52 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this is within the constraint of the x  ray luminosity from chandra x  ray observation for blob 1 , @xmath53 erg s@xmath2 ( chapman et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the line  of  sight velocity distribution is also shown in figure 1d . since gas in outer regions has a velocity higher than 500 km s@xmath2 , which exceeds the escape velocity of this galaxy ( 472  km  s@xmath2 ) , it may escape from the galaxy potential well , while in inner regions gas velocity is lower than the escape velocity , and therefore gas is confined within the gravitational potential . if the total mass of galaxy is lower , winds will be more effective ( mori , yoshii & nomoto 1999 ; ferrara , pettini & shchekinov 2000 ) , and provide an efficient mechanism to distribute heavy elements over cosmological volumes ( mori , ferrara & madau 2002 ) . in the future , the more detailed bubbly structure seen in figures",
    "1e may be directly detected by high resolution observations ( @xmath54 arcsec ) , of redshifted h@xmath55 emission ( @xmath56 erg s@xmath2 ) , with the _ james webb space telescope_.",
    "as shown in the previous section , labs could correspond to a quite early phase of galaxy chemical evolution . in this case , the observed bubbly features imply that the self ",
    "enrichment is on  going in a very inhomogeneous fashion in labs .",
    "actually , in the present simulation , the distribution of metallicity is very inhomogeneous as shown in figure 1c , where the predicted oxygen abundance [ o / h ] is shown .",
    "the gas in the vicinity of sne is polluted with newly synthesized heavy elements ejected from sne , but a large amount of the gas still retains of low metallicity .",
    "the interactions of expanding hot bubbles give rise to a complex structure in the inner regions , where a metal  rich gas @xmath4\\ga -1.74 $ ] coexists with an almost primordial gas .",
    "they are separated from each other by cool shells .",
    "interestingly , the outer regions tend to have higher metallicity compared with inner regions .",
    "this is because the metal enriched super ",
    "bubbles are less diluted with metal ",
    "deficient gas in the outer low  density regions .",
    "figure 2 shows the relation between density and metallicity , where the abundance is represented by [ fe / h ] as well as [ o / h ] and the contours denote the mass level .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the mixing of heavy elements proceeds incompletely in an very inhomogeneous manner .",
    "the gas with higher metallicity of @xmath4 > 0 $ ] ( @xmath3 > -0.5 $ ] ) is distributed only in low density regions of @xmath57 , which corresponds to hot super  bubbles . on the other hand ,",
    "a part of the sn ejecta mix with the dense regions with primordial abundance ( either shells or overdensities around subgalactic condensations ) and tend to be diluted to lower metallicity of @xmath4\\sim -1.7 $ ] ( @xmath3\\sim -2.3 $ ] ) .",
    "note that considerable dispersion of metallicity ( @xmath58\\la 0 $ ] ) is found in high density regions of @xmath59 .",
    "this spread of metallicity hardly depends upon the numerical resolution as long as hot bubbles are fully resolved in the simulation .",
    "hence , the next generation of stars which are expected to form out of the high  density regions should exhibit a similar dispersion of metallicity .",
    "so far , the theoretical models of galactic chemical evolution have often assumed the homogeneous ism ( one  zone model ) , with the instantaneous and perfect mixing of heavy elements synthesized in sne . on the contrary ,",
    "the present simulations show that the metal mixing proceeds in a very inhomogeneous fashion .",
    "this means that one should carefully treat the metal mixing for the study of chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "the volume  averaged metallicity of the gas in the present simulation is found to be @xmath3_{\\rm v}=-2.30 $ ] , while the density  weighted metallicity is @xmath3_\\rho=-2.51 $ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "if one derives the mean metallicity based on x  ray flux , @xmath3_{\\rm x}=-0.71 $ ] is found , which is about forty times higher than the volume  averaged one .",
    "this is because x  ray is mainly emitted from the metal  rich gas in the hot bubbles .",
    "the density  weighted metallicity is well above a so  called critical metallicity , @xmath60 ( omukai 2000 ; bromm et al .",
    "2001 ; schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) marking the transition from a top  heavy imf to a normal ( i.e. salpeter ) imf .",
    "thus , the next stellar generation will form with an imf similar to the present  day one , with the low  mass stars possibly forming the metal  poor halo population ( mcwilliam et al . 1995 ; ryan , norris & beers 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , it is worth noting the existence of very low metallicity ( @xmath3 \\approx -5 $ ] ) , high density ( @xmath61 @xmath40 ) regions .",
    "since the abundance of these regions can be below the critical metallicity , the imf could be similar to that of pop iii stars ( e.g. nakamura & umemura 2001 ) .",
    "recently , an extremely metal  poor star ( @xmath3 \\approx -5.3 $ ] ) is discovered by christlieb et al .",
    "( 2002 ) may be a relic of such stars .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the model galaxy is constructed from primordial gas in this paper . at redshift",
    "@xmath9 , absorption lines in quasar spectra show that at least some fraction of the igm is polluted to @xmath62 .",
    "if a galaxy forms from a well  mixed pre  enriched medium , the metallicity would be accordingly shifted to higher values , hence precluding the formation of extremely metal  poor stars .",
    "we have suggested that labs can be identified with primordial galaxies catched in a supernova - dominated phase .",
    "this conclusion is based on ultra  high resolution hydrodynamic calculations which resolve individual sn remnants . as a result",
    ", we found that the resultant luminosity can account for the observed luminosity of labs ; in addition , the bubbly structures produced by multiple sn explosions are quite similar to the observed features in surface brightness of labs .",
    "hence the emerging theoretical picture is fully consistent with experimental data .",
    "if this picture is correct , bubbly features may show that the metal mixing is highly inhomogeneous in labs .",
    "the present simulation predicts a quite wide range of metallicity for the next generation of stars .",
    "this may affect the galaxy evolution significantly .",
    "this work was supported in part by the grant  in  aid of the ministry of education , culture , science , and sports , 14740132 and 16002003 , and by the promotion and mutual aid corporation for private schools of japan .",
    "the numerical computations were carried on a massive parallel computer cp ",
