    "<S> they pose the solar neutrino problem 1994 .    </S>",
    "<S> re - tuning the solar model gives no easy solution@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a lower central temperature would suppress @xmath7 production and the @xmath3 rate , but to explain @xmath2 rates the @xmath8 line must then be obliterated - a bit unlikely given that @xmath7 is made from @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> neutrino oscillations offer several possible explanations , that i briefly compare .    * </S>",
    "<S> 2 . long wavelength vacuum oscillations ( lwvo)*.    suppose the weak eigenstate @xmath1 , emitted by @xmath9-decays in the sun , is actually a superposition of two mass eigenstates : @xmath10 with @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass eigenstates propagate independently with time t , each picking up a different phase factor @xmath12 , so that after a distance @xmath13 the projection back onto @xmath1 becomes @xmath14 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the probability that this evolved state can interact like @xmath1 is then @xmath15 where @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 illustrates this oscillatory probability . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath17 there is negligible effect ; for values @xmath18 there are resolvable oscillations ; for values @xmath19 the oscillations are averaged in practice , either by source / detector size or by energy resolution . averaged 2-neutrino oscillations </S>",
    "<S> suppress by at most 1/2 , but n - neutrino mixing can give 1/n ; however this suppression is flat and therefore unsuited to the 1994 solar problem . on the other hand , resolved oscillations provide a strongly varying suppression . </S>",
    "<S> try overlaying figs.1 and 2 ( they have the same horizontal log scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we tune @xmath20 such that the first minimum falls around a few mev , the kamiokande @xmath21 rate will be somewhat suppressed ; if we fine - tune to put the @xmath22 line in a minimum , the @xmath2 rate will be somewhat more suppressed ; meanwhile the @xmath4 rate suffers less , since its dominant pp neutrinos encounter only average suppression . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly have the makings of one or more solutions here , with these  just - so \" oscillations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows typical recent fits @xcite in the @xmath23 ) parameter plane ; the disconnected regions put the @xmath8 line in different minima of p. note that for @xmath24 mixing , @xmath25 scattering contributes a bit to the kamiokande signal and helps to explain why it is less suppressed than @xmath2 ; @xmath26 sterile flavour mixing lacks this help and is harder to fit .    </S>",
    "<S> two special features arise from lwvo resolved oscillation patterns @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + i ) there is an oscillatory modulation on the shape of the high- energy @xmath7 spectrum contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the shape ( though not the magnitude ) of this ssm component is model - independent ; the modulation would be detectable at sno@xcite and super - kamiokande . </S>",
    "<S> see figs . </S>",
    "<S> 8,9 at the end . </S>",
    "<S> + ii ) the @xmath8 line with fixed @xmath5 has oscillatory strength , because the earth - sun distance @xmath27 has small seasonal variations . </S>",
    "<S> this line strength could be measured directly by borexino@xcite ; the effect is diluted in @xmath2 and @xmath4 signals . + ( present @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 data constrain ( i ) and ( ii ) rather weakly ) .    </S>",
    "<S> but mixing @xmath1 with @xmath31 or @xmath32 affects @xmath1 spectra from supernovae ; sn1987a data may disfavour large @xmath33 @xcite , including solutions like fig.3a .    * </S>",
    "<S> 3 . oscillations in matter*.    coherent forward scattering in matter generates a refractive index and affects propagation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> z - exchange processes are the same for @xmath1 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , generating a common phase that can be ignored , but w - exchange contributes only to @xmath34 scattering and significantly changes the propagation equation : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the vacuum mixing angle , @xmath37 is the electron number density and @xmath38 or @xmath32 ( for sterile @xmath39 see later ) . diagonalizing the propagation matrix above </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the mixing angle in matter @xmath40 depends on @xmath41 : @xmath42 if @xmath43 the mixing is enhanced ; it becomes maximal ( @xmath44 ) where the denominator vanishes - sometimes called a resonance . </S>",
    "<S> as neutrinos travel out from the solar core , the mixing angle @xmath40 and the matter - propagation eigenstates @xmath45 change continuously .    </S>",
    "<S> this gives a possibility for efficient @xmath46 conversion via adiabatic level crossing ( the msw effect@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that @xmath41 is far above the resonance value at the point of @xmath1 creation in the solar core ( i.e. @xmath47 ) ; then @xmath48 here . </S>",
    "<S> if subsequent propagation is adiabatic , the local eigenstate components are essentially preserved : @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> emerging from the sun , the dominant @xmath50 component becomes the vacuum mass eigenstate @xmath51 if the vacuum mixing angle @xmath36 is small ; thus initial @xmath1 ends up as mostly @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.4 shows how the two eigenvalues @xmath52 of the propagation matrix behave versus @xmath37 ; solid lines give the case of no mixing , @xmath53 ; dashed lines show how the eigenvalues cross over when mixing is present . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath37 changes slowly enough for the mixing to act ( adiabatically ) , the physical state follows the full eigenstates ( dashed lines ) ; but if @xmath54 changes too suddenly , the physical state follows the unmixed eigenstates ( solid lines ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there are 2 conditions for adiabatic level crossing . </S>",
    "<S> + ( i ) central density is above the resonance value : @xmath55                          \\simeq 10 ^ 5,\\ ] ] ( ii ) density changes slowly enough near the resonance for adiabaticity : from the landau - zener approximation we obtain@xcite @xmath56cos2\\theta                          \\simeq 3 \\times 10 ^ 8 sin^22\\theta.\\ ] ] the detailed consequences require big calculations , but we need no computer to see the main features . </S>",
    "<S> the msw effect gives a bathtub - shaped suppression factor ; see fig.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the steep left - hand end is determined by the resonance - crossing condition ( i ) ; the sloping right - hand end covers the range where adiabaticity breaks down , determined by condition ( ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can choose almost any bathtub we please , versus energy @xmath5 , by selecting @xmath57 to get the left - hand end and @xmath58 to get the length ( and also the depth ) of the bathtub . </S>",
    "<S> however , condition ( ii ) excludes msw effects in the lwvo region . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that efficient @xmath59 conversion does not require big vacuum mixing @xmath36 ; on the contrary , the best conversion is with small @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> the msw bathtub offers an immediate explanation of the apparent differential suppression of the @xmath1 spectrum : let the sloping end lie across the @xmath3 scattering range @xmath60 ( moderate @xmath3 suppression ) ; let the flat bottom lie across the rest of the @xmath2 capture range @xmath61 ( more @xmath2 suppression ) ; let the steep end fall near @xmath62 at the top of the @xmath63 spectrum contribution ( less @xmath4 suppression ) . </S>",
    "<S> this simple prescription leads to the best msw solution : @xmath64 with @xmath65 , fig.6a shows a typical recent fit@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a large-@xmath36 region , not really a good solution but a local @xmath66 minimum , where the bathtub is much shallower and wider .    </S>",
    "<S> matter effects can also arise in the earth . </S>",
    "<S> they are not msw ( no chance of adiabatic level crossing ) , just amplified vacuum oscillations through which @xmath31 can convert back to @xmath1 when the sun is below the horizon , giving day / night and summer / winter asymmetries in counting rates . </S>",
    "<S> there are 2 conditions for big earth effects . + ( i ) near - resonant amplification in the earth ( @xmath67 large ) : @xmath68 assuming rock density @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> + ( ii ) matter oscillation wavelength ( @xmath70 ) less than earth diameter ( @xmath71 ) . at resonance </S>",
    "<S> the matter - eigenvalue difference is @xmath72 , giving @xmath73 both these conditions can be approached or satisfied in a small region of @xmath74 for given @xmath75 , but @xmath36 can not be very small . for the kamiokande @xmath3 range , @xmath76 mev , a region near the msw large-@xmath36 solution is sensitive to earth effects ; the absence of a day / night asymmetry@xcite excludes this region ( labelled `` excluded 90% c.l . '' in fig.6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> future experiments will enlarge this region of sensitivity .    </S>",
    "<S> similar things can happen for @xmath1 mixing with sterile @xmath39 , but now z - exchange no longer drops out ; coherent @xmath34 and @xmath77 z - exchanges cancel and the net effect is to replace @xmath37 above by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the neutron number density@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the critical parameters change a bit and the large-@xmath36 solution vanishes ( fig.6b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> three- or four - flavour neutrino mixing offers more complicated possibilities , with more free parameters , that we do not need yet and shall not discuss today .    </S>",
    "<S> * 4 . exotic neutral current effects . *    </S>",
    "<S> if there are new neutral - current interactions , such as @xmath80 flavour - conserving or flavour - flipping scattering via r - parity - violating b - squark exchanges@xcite , new terms will appear in the matter - propagation matrix . </S>",
    "<S> in the most general case with diagonal and off - diagonal contributions from scattering on @xmath81 distributions in matter , this matrix can be put in the form @xmath82 in the approximation @xmath83 , with just two constant parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 describing the new physics in units of the standard matter effect . if @xmath86 , we have mixing and oscillations even in the absence of vacuum mixing ( @xmath87)@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these new terms modify the previous msw solutions . </S>",
    "<S> fig.7 compares @xmath88 solutions in the cases @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( with @xmath92)@xcite . adding this small exotic mixing </S>",
    "<S> scarcely affects the large-@xmath36 solution but distorts or even splits the small-@xmath36 solution .    * </S>",
    "<S> 5 . outlook . </S>",
    "<S> *    the different two - flavour - mixing scenarios can be distinguished ( or rejected ) by future measurements of the @xmath7 spectrum modulation ( sno , super - kamiokande , see figs.8,9 ) , the @xmath8 0.86 mev line contribution ( borexino ) , and possible day / night effects ( sno , super - kamiokande , icarus ) : @xmath93 furthermore , the charged - current / neutral - current event ratio [ sno , borex , icarus ] will distinguish whether the neutrino flavour mixed with @xmath1 is active ( @xmath94 ) or sterile ( @xmath39 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the problem will become much more clearly defined .    </S>",
