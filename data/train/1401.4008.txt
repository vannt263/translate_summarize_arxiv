    "the significant role played by processes involving neutrinos in core - collapse supernovae ( type ii supernovae ) is well known  @xcite . until the core reaches densities of @xmath2 , a substantial amount of the gravitational energy of the collapse",
    "is radiated by neutrinos that leave the star freely . however , at higher densities neutrino interactions with matter become important on the time - scale of the collapse , leading to neutrino trapping and thermalization .",
    "supernova core - collapse simulations require a detailed description of neutrino transport and should in principle include all potentially important neutrino reactions .",
    "it was first pointed by haxton  @xcite that the neutral - current inelastic neutrino scattering on nuclei involving the excitation of giant resonances can lead to significant neutrino cross - sections and , therefore , this process should be incorporated into core - collapse simulations . shortly thereafter ,",
    "this was done by bruenn and haxton  @xcite .",
    "they found that the inelastic neutrino - scattering on nuclei plays the same important role as the neutrino - electron scattering in equilibrating neutrinos with matter ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in their study bruenn and haxton approximated the nuclear composition of the core by a single representative nucleus , @xmath0fe .",
    "moreover , the relevant cross - sections were calculated by assuming that only allowed gamow - teller and first - forbidden upward transitions from the nuclear ground - state contribute to neutrino scattering . however , supernova matter has a temperature of an order of 1  mev or higher and the neutrinos scatter off nuclei which are in thermally populated excited states . as was first realized in ref .",
    "@xcite , upward and downward transitions from nuclear excited states to lower - lying states completely remove the energy threshold for the inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering in the supernova environment and contribute to a significant enhancement of the cross - section for low - energy neutrinos .",
    "moreover , and this is more important , due to downward transitions from nuclear excited states to lower - lying states neutrinos can gain energy after interacting with the nucleus , thereby assisting in cooling the core and reducing its entropy .",
    "this is different to inelastic scattering with electrons where due to the degeneracy of electrons neutrinos mainly loose energy .",
    "an explicit calculation of reaction rates and cross - sections at finite temperature can be performed by summing over boltzmann - weighted , individually determined contributions from nuclear excited states . however , for @xmath3 a state - by - state evaluation includes too many states to derive the cross section for each individual state and , hence , is unfeasible . to overcome this difficulty an approximate method to treat thermal effects on the inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering was proposed in  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) within the so - called hybrid approach  @xcite . in this method",
    "the contributions of the allowed gamow - teller transitions to the neutrino - nucleus cross - section are derived from large - scale shell - model ( sm ) calculations , while the forbidden contributions are considered within the rpa .    to treat thermal effects within the hybrid approach , the gamow - teller contribution to the cross - section",
    "is split into the neutrino down - scattering ( @xmath4 ) and neutrino up - scattering ( @xmath5 ) parts , where @xmath6 denote the neutrino energies in the initial and final states , respectively . for",
    "the down - scattering part the brink hypothesis was applied which states that gt distributions built on nuclear excited states are the same as those for the nuclear ground state but shifted by the excitation energy . under this assumption ,",
    "the down - scattering part of the cross - section becomes temperature independent .",
    "the temperature dependence arises from the up - scattering part which accounts for contributions of downward transitions from nuclear excited states .",
    "these contributions are determined by inversion of the shell - model gt distributions for the low - lying states .",
    "large - scale shell - model calculations provide a detailed strength distribution of charge - neutral gamow - teller ( gt@xmath7 ) transitions that strongly dominate the inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering at low neutrino energies ( @xmath8 ) . however , being applied to hot nuclei , this method has its own shortcomings mainly because it partially employs the brink hypothesis when treating gt@xmath7 transitions from nuclear excited states .",
    "as follows from experimental studies of giant dipole resonances ( gdr ) in hot nuclei , the gdr strength function exhibits a temperature dependence ( see , e.g. , the monograph @xcite and one of the latest reviews  @xcite ) , i.e. , the validity of the brink hypothesis is not obvious .",
    "moreover , theoretical calculations performed for charge - exchange gt transitions in the framework of the shell - model monte carlo ( smmc ) method demonstrate that with increasing temperature the gt centroid shifts to lower energies and the width of the distribution increases with the appearance of low - lying states  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the present computer capabilities allow application of large - scale shell - model calculations only to iron group nuclei ( @xmath9-shell , @xmath10 ) , whereas neutrino scattering on more massive and neutron - rich nuclei also may play an important role in various astrophysical scenarios .",
    "thus , the problem of an accurate description of inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering in the supernova environment is not solved completely yet and alternative methods are desirable .    in  @xcite , we have developed such an alternative approach to treat thermal effects on inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering cross - sections .",
    "this approach is based on the thermal quasiparticle random phase approximation ( tqrpa ) .",
    "we apply it in the context of the thermo field dynamics ( tfd ) formalism  @xcite which enables a transparent treatment of upward and downward transitions from thermally excited nuclear states and opens possibilities for systematic improvements .",
    "this approach was also recently used in studies of the electron capture on hot nuclei under supernova conditions  @xcite .    in  @xcite",
    ", the thermal effects on the inelastic neutrino scattering off the hot @xmath11fe nucleus were investigated .",
    "it was shown that the tqrpa does not support brink s hypothesis and leads to temperature dependent strength distributions for allowed and forbidden transitions . as a result , both the up- and down - scattering parts of the cross - section are temperature dependent . despite the differences between the two approaches , the tqrpa revealed the same thermal effect as was found in  @xcite .",
    "namely , a temperature increase results in considerable enhancement of the cross - section for neutrino energies lower than the energy of the gt@xmath7 resonance .    in the present paper , we extend our previous study by also considering inelastic neutrino scattering off neutron - rich nuclei beyond @xmath9-shell . in our calculations , we take into account not only the first - forbidden transitions but also contributions from higher multipoles . for the selected iron isotope , @xmath12fe",
    ", we perform a detailed comparison of the calculated tqrpa cross - sections with the hybrid approach results and discuss the reason for the observed discrepancy at low neutrino energies .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in the stellar environment during the core - collapse phase all nuclear reactions mediated by the strong and electromagnetic interaction are in equilibrium with their inverse  @xcite . neglecting weak - interaction",
    "mediated reactions , nuclei are in thermal equilibrium with heat and particle reservoirs and , therefore , can be described as a thermal ensemble . in tfd , such an equilibrium ensemble",
    "is represented by a temperature - dependent state termed the thermal vacuum @xmath13 .",
    "the thermal vacuum is determined as the zero - energy eigenstate of the thermal hamiltonian , @xmath14 , and it satisfies the thermal state condition @xmath15 in the above equations @xmath16 is the original nuclear hamiltonian and @xmath17 is its tilde counterpart acting in the auxiliary hilbert space ; an operator @xmath18 acts in the physical hilbert space , @xmath19 is its tilde partner , and @xmath20 is a phase factor .",
    "the thermal state condition guarantees that the expectation value @xmath21 is equal to the ( grand)canonical average of @xmath18 . in this sense ,",
    "relation   is equivalent to the kubo - martin - schwinger condition for an equilibrium ( grand)canonical density matrix  @xcite .",
    "weak - interaction processes , such as inelastic neutrino scattering , induce transitions from the thermal vacuum to excited states of the thermal nuclear hamiltonian . as follows from the definition of @xmath22 ,",
    "each of its eigenstates with positive energy has a counterpart  the tilde - conjugate eigenstate  with negative but same absolute value of energy .",
    "transitions from the thermal vacuum to positive energy states ( upward transitions ) correspond to excitation of the nucleus , while transitions to negative energy states ( downward transitions ) describe the decay of thermally excited states .",
    "let us now consider a general nuclear hamiltonian consisting of mean fields for protons and neutrons , pairing interactions , and residual two - nucleon interactions : @xmath23 to fix an average number of protons and neutrons we introduce the respective chemical potentials into  @xmath24 .",
    "the residual interaction can contain both particle - hole and particle - particle terms .",
    "we assume a spherically symmetric nucleus , although the deformation can be easily included into the theory . within the tqrpa , to find excited states of a hot nucleus , we first introduce thermal quasiparticle creation ( @xmath25 ) and annihilation ( @xmath26 ) operators which account for pairing correlations at finite temperature .",
    "the structure of this operators is found by diagonalizing the @xmath27 part of the thermal hamiltonian and simultaneously demanding that the vacuum of thermal quasiparticles obeys the thermal state condition  .",
    "then , to account for the long - range residual interaction , we introduce thermal phonon operators @xmath28 of given total angular momentum @xmath29 whose action on the thermal vacuum @xmath13 creates thermal excited states , while the thermal vacuum itself is the vacuum for the @xmath30 operators .    the structure and the energy of thermal phonons can be found by applying either the variational principle or the equation of motion method under two additional constraints : ( i ) phonon operators commute like bosonic ones ; ( ii ) the vacuum of thermal phonons obeys the thermal state condition  .",

    ", we have performed a detailed analysis of finite temperature effects on the spectrum of charge - exchange thermal phonons . here",
    "we repeat the main conclusions which remain valid for the charge - neutral excitations as well . due to the terms in   involving tilde thermal quasiparticle operators ( terms like @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) the spectrum of thermal phonons",
    "contains negative- and low - energy states which do not exist at zero temperature .",
    "since ( see  @xcite for more details ) the creation of a tilde quasiparticle is equivalent to the annihilation of a thermally excited bogoliubov quasiparticle , the excitation of the aforementioned `` new '' phonon states can be interpreted as thermally unblocked transitions from nuclear excited states .",
    "furthermore , both the energies of thermal quasiparticles and the interaction strength between them are temperature dependent . as a result , after solving the tqrpa equations we obtain a temperature - dependent spectrum of thermal phonons .",
    "once the structure of thermal phonons is determined , one can evaluate transition strengths ( probabilities ) from the thermal vacuum to thermal one - phonon states . for a given transition operator @xmath40 we have @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the strengths of upward and downward transitions , respectively .",
    "they are connected by the relationship @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a positive solution of the tqrpa equations .",
    "this relation links the probabilities to transfer and gain energy @xmath46 from a hot nucleus .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same relationship between the upward and downward transition strengths is used in  @xcite when considering the thermal strength functions for emission and absorption of neutrino - antineutrino pairs by hot nuclei . in  @xcite , the relation results from the principle of detailed balance . in tfd",
    ", it arises from the thermal state condition imposed on the thermal vacuum .",
    "we also would like to point out that in  @xcite , due to the application of brink s hypothesis , the absorption ( upward ) strength is considered to be temperature independent and only the emission ( downward ) strength depends on temperature due to the boltzmann factor  @xmath47 .",

    "i.e. , in the long wavelength limit ( @xmath68 ) , only two multipole operators survive , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which contribute to @xmath71 transitions .",
    "then the integration over the scattering angle in eq .   can be performed analytically and , in view of the detailed balance principle  , the low - energy cross - section can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the transition strength for the gamow - teller operator ( see eq .",
    "the sum @xmath74 in the first , down - scattering , term implies summation over @xmath71 non - tilde thermal phonon states with the energy @xmath75 .",
    "apparently , for vanishing neutrino energies , @xmath76 , only the second , up - scattering , term persists at finite temperatures .",
    "we also note that although the boltzmann factor suppresses the contributions of downward transitions from high - lying thermally excited states , the phase - space factor @xmath77 acts in the opposite direction and favors them .",
    "the formalism presented above is employed to study thermal effects on the inelastic neutrino scattering off the two sample nuclei , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the iron isotope is among the most abundant nuclei at the early stage of the core - collapse , while the neutron - rich germanium isotope can be considered as the average nucleus at later stages  @xcite .",

    "the excitations of natural parity ( @xmath94 ) are generated by the multipole and spin - multipole @xmath95 interactions  , while the spin - multipole interactions with @xmath96 are responsible for the states of unnatural parity ( @xmath97 ) . to generate @xmath98 excitations , we take into account both the particle - hole residual interaction and the particle - particle interaction stemming from the pairing part of the hamiltonian . here",
    "we would like to emphasize that the inclusion of the particle - particle residual interaction into the hamiltonian does not affect the strength distributions and the cross - sections for temperatures above the critical one .",

    "[ gt0_t ] , we display on a logarithmic scale the gt@xmath7 strength distributions at three different temperatures relevant in the supernova context  @xcite : @xmath148  mev corresponds to the condition in the core of a presupernova model for a @xmath149 star ; @xmath150  mev and @xmath151  mev relate approximately to neutrino trapping and neutrino thermalization stages , respectively .",
    "the transition energy @xmath152 refers to the excitation energy of a thermal one - phonon state and is equivalent to the neutrino energy transfer . to make the thermal effects more visible",
    ", the ground - state gt@xmath7 distributions are displayed in fig .",
    "[ gt0_t ] as well .",
    "strength distributions for @xmath0fe ( left panels ) and for @xmath1ge ( right panels ) vs. transition energy .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the neutrino energy transfer .",
    "the arrows indicate the zero - temperature threshold @xmath153 for inelastic neutrino scattering off @xmath0fe . ]    since the brink hypothesis is not valid within our approach , in fig .",
    "[ gt0_t ] we observe a redistribution of the gt@xmath7 strength for upward transitions ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "namely , at temperatures above the critical one no extra energy has be paid to break a cooper pair .",
    "therefore , by virtue of the vanishing of pairing correlations , both the gt@xmath7 resonance and its low - energy tail move to lower energies .",
    "our calculations indicate that , with increasing temperature up to 1.72  mev , the resulting resonance energy shift reaches about 1.5  mev in @xmath0fe and 1.2  mev in @xmath1ge .",
    "it is interesting to note that within the present tqrpa calculations for @xmath0fe the low - lying gt@xmath7 strength shifts below the zero - temperature threshold ( i.e. , below the experimental energy of the first @xmath71 state ) .",
    "furthermore , the thermal smearing of the nuclear fermi surface makes low - energy particle - particle and hole - hole transitions possible which are pauli - blocked at zero temperature .",
    "such thermally - unblocked transitions enhance the low - lying component of the gt@xmath7 distributions and make it more fragmented . since the @xmath1ge nucleus has a larger single - particle level density near the fermi surface , the temperature - induced enhancement and fragmentation of the low - lying gt@xmath7 upward strength is more significant than in @xmath0fe .",
    "downward strength distributions obtained using ( dashed lines ) and without using ( solid lines ) the brink hypothesis .",
    "note , that the values are scaled by a factor of @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) and @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) . ]    here we would like to stress that the appearance of a sizeable amount of the low - lying transition strength in nuclei at @xmath159 is predicted in all theoretical studies of hot nuclei .",
    "for example , this was found already in one of the first papers on the subject ref.@xcite , where the distributions of the electric @xmath160 and @xmath161 transitions at @xmath159 in @xmath162pb were calculated and in many subsequent studies ( see , e.g. , @xcite . the same effect is predicted for the charge - exchange allowed and first - forbidden transitions as well @xcite . for the charge - exchange gamow - teller transitions",
    "this feature was also obtained within the shell - model monte - carlo theory  @xcite .",
    "moreover , shell - model monte - carlo calculations demonstrate that with increasing temperature the centroid of the gt@xmath105 resonance shifts to lower energies .    focusing our attention on the negative energy downward transitions we observe from fig .",
    "[ gt0_t ] that the corresponding gt@xmath7 strength increases with increasing temperature .",
    "this is just a consequence of detailed balance  : the higher the temperature , the more substantial is the population of nuclear excited states and hence , the higher is the probability to gain energy from a hot nucleus .",
    "note that the gt@xmath7 strength around @xmath163 can be attributed to the deexcitation of the gt@xmath7 resonance .",
    "given the importance of thermal effects on the upward strength distributions , it is worthwhile to examine how the violation of brink s hypothesis affects the downward strength .",
    "it is obvious that the shift of the gt@xmath7 distributions to lower energies and the appearance of low - energy transitions should magnify the strength of downward transitions .",
    "this effect is clearly demonstrated in fig .  [ gt0_running ] which shows running sums for the gt@xmath7 downward strength distributions derived by using the brink hypothesis or not .",
    "the former are obtained from the ground - state ( @xmath113 ) distributions by multiplication with the boltzmann factor @xmath47 . referring to the figure ,",
    "the considerable increase of the overall downward strength is mainly caused by the thermal effects on the low - energy tail in the gt@xmath7 distributions .",
    "this is most pronounced at low temperatures ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "however , at high temperatures ( @xmath158 ) the gt@xmath7 resonance becomes thermally populated and its shift to lower energies also contributes to the downward strength increase .",
    "fe and @xmath1ge at three different temperatures relevant for core - collapse . for comparison",
    "the ground - state cross - sections are also shown .",
    "middle panels : contributions of forbidden transitions to the finite - temperature cross - sections .",
    "lower panels : temperature dependence of the fraction of down - scattered neutrinos in the thermal enhancement of the cross - section . ]",
    "the detailed discussion above allows us to understand better the thermal effects on the inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering . in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ crsect_t ] , we compare the ground - state cross - sections with those calculated at the three core - collapse temperatures .",
    "as follows from our calculations , temperature effects are unimportant for @xmath164  mev when neutrinos have sufficiently large energy to excite the gt@xmath7 resonance and collective excitations with other multipolarities .",
    "note that a downward shift of the gt@xmath7 resonance only marginally affects the cross - sections at such high neutrino energies .",
    "however , as one can see from the plots , the cross - sections significantly depend on temperature for low - energy neutrinos .",
    "namely , the reaction threshold disappears and the cross - sections are enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude when the temperature rises from @xmath165 to @xmath166 .",
    "it is significant that all these features have pointed out in  @xcite as well .    in fig .",
    "[ crsect_t ] , we also demonstrate the overall contribution of the forbidden transitions @xmath167 to the cross - sections .",
    "in contrast to hybrid approach calculations  @xcite their contributions are temperature dependent . however , comparing the upper and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ crsect_t ] , one concludes that the enhancement of the cross - sections at finite temperatures is essentially due to thermal effects on the gt@xmath7 transition strengths .    at vanishing neutrino energies , @xmath76 ,",
    "the finite temperature cross - sections are given by the second , up - scattering , term in eq .   which accounts for the gt@xmath7 downward transitions from thermally excited nuclear states .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ gt0_t ] and pointed out previously , the strength of such transitions increases with temperature thereby enhancing the cross - sections",
    ". however , in our approach due to the violation of the brink hypothesis , the down - scattering part of the cross - section , @xmath168 , is also temperature dependent and it increases with temperature owing to the thermally unblocked low - energy gt@xmath7 transitions and the downward shift of the gt@xmath7 resonance .",
    "this effect is clearly shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath11fe .    to analyze relative importance of the two types of neutrino scattering processes in the thermal enhancement of the cross - section",
    ", we introduce the ratio @xmath169 @xmath170 where the difference @xmath171 represents an overall enhancement of the cross - section due to thermal effects .",
    "note that within the hybrid approach @xmath172 , because @xmath173 in this approach .",
    "we plot the ratio @xmath169 in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ crsect_t ] as a function of @xmath110 for the selected temperatures .",
    "as expected , the ratio  @xmath174 for low - energy neutrinos and then , with increase of @xmath110 , @xmath169 gradually decreases indicating a rising contribution of the up - scattering process to the cross - section thermal enhancement .",
    "it is seen from the plots that for @xmath175 neutrinos , both from the up - scattering and down - scattering processes contribute to the noticeable enhancement of the cross - sections , although their relative importance depends on temperature : the higher the temperature the more important is the contribution of the up - scattering process .",
    "consequently , even for @xmath133 neutrinos , when the excitation of the gt@xmath7 resonance becomes possible , the up - scattering component of the cross - section appears to be comparable with the down - scattering one for temperatures @xmath176 .",
    "fe calculated within the present tqrpa approach and the hybrid approach ( ref .",
    "@xcite , fig.11 ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines show the present results for @xmath156 and @xmath158 , respectively .",
    "the dash - dotted and dash - double - dotted lines show results from ref .",
    "@xcite for the same @xmath177 values . ]    in fig .",
    "[ crsect_t_comparison ] , we compare our results for @xmath0fe with those obtained within the hybrid approach @xcite .",
    "the comparison is made for temperatures @xmath178 .",
    "as one can see , at @xmath179 there is noticeable disagreement between the results of the two approaches : the tqrpa cross - sections are larger by a factor of 2 to 5 than the hybrid approach ones . to understand the cause of the discrepancy",
    ", we calculate the spectrum of outgoing neutrinos scattered off @xmath0fe at the same temperatures as in fig .",
    "[ crsect_t_comparison ] and compare the results with the hybrid approach calculations ( see fig.13 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , the spectra are shown for the same initial neutrino energies as in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath180 .",
    "note that for a clearer presentation and for comparison convenience , the tqrpa spectra are normalized to unity and folded with the breit - wigner function with a width of @xmath181 .",
    "fe at @xmath182 and @xmath166 and three initial neutrino energies : @xmath183 ( solid line ) , @xmath184 ( dashed line , all values shifted by  0.2 ) , and @xmath185 ( dash - dotted line , all values shifted by 0.4 ) .",
    "the triangles correspond to the energy of the incoming neutrino . ]    at low temperatures , the downward transitions from the thermally excited gt@xmath7 resonance are strongly suppressed by the boltzmann factor .",
    "therefore , for @xmath156 and @xmath186 the spectrum is dominated by neutrinos up- and down - scattered due to the low - energy gt@xmath7 transitions . in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , such transitions correspond to the sizable peaks in the spectrum at around @xmath187 .",
    "the dominance of low - energy up- and down - transitions in the scattering of low - energy neutrinos off @xmath0fe at @xmath156 is also supported by the hybrid approach studies ( see the upper - middle panel of fig .  13 in ref .",
    "however , the energy and the strength of such transitions calculated with the tqrpa and the hybrid approach are different . as discussed in detail above , within the tqrpa thermal effects shift the low - lying gt strength in @xmath0fe to energies below the zero - temperature threshold ( fig .  [ gt0_t ] ) and significantly increase the strength of the corresponding inverse downward transitions ( fig .",
    "[ gt0_running ] ) , thus favoring neutrino inelastic scattering .",
    "no such effects are expected within the hybrid approach due to the application of the brink hypothesis .",
    "for this reason , the low - energy ( @xmath188 ) tqrpa cross - section at @xmath156 appears to be larger than the hybrid approach one . with increasing energy of incoming neutrinos ,",
    "the excitation of the gt@xmath7 resonance comes into play as evidenced by peaks in the spectra around @xmath189 .",
    "consequently , the cross - section becomes less sensitive to thermal effects on the low - lying gt@xmath7 strength . as a consequence for @xmath190 we observe excellent agreement between the tqrpa and the hybrid approach results .",
    "the situation is slightly different for the higher temperature , @xmath158 .",
    "now downward transitions from the thermally excited gt@xmath7 resonance are possible , and owing to a large phase - space factor they can contribute significantly to the up - scattering of low - energy neutrinos . in the spectra this contribution corresponds to the peak at around @xmath191 . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ gt0_running ] , at @xmath192 thermal effects increase the strength of downward transitions from the gt@xmath7 resonance .",
    "although this increase is not of the same magnitude as for the low - lying gt@xmath7 strength , due to a larger phase - space factor , its contribution to the cross - section enhancement is substantial .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that at @xmath158 the joint action of thermal changes in both the low - lying gt@xmath7 strength and the gt@xmath7 resonance enhances the absolute value of the tqrpa cross - section at @xmath193 in comparison with the hybrid approach .",
    "like for the @xmath156 case , thermal effects become less important for higher neutrino energies , and both approaches yield very similar results for the cross - sections .    considering thermal effects on angular distributions of outgoing neutrinos",
    "we find that they are rather unimportant . for up - scattered neutrinos these distributions",
    "are only slightly more backward peaked than those for down - scattered neutrinos owing to the larger momentum transfer .",
    "we have studied thermal effects on the inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering in the supernova environment .",
    "the thermal effects were treated within the thermal quasiparticle random phase approximation .",
    "the calculations were performed for @xmath0fe and @xmath1ge .",
    "we find that the tqrpa calculations do not support the brink hypothesis and lead to temperature - dependent strength distributions for both allowed and forbidden transitions involved in the neutrino inelastic scattering .",
    "it is shown that thermal effects shift the gt@xmath7 centroid to lower energies and make low - energy gt@xmath7 transitions possible . as a result , in contrast to hybrid approach calculations  @xcite , both the up - scattering and down - scattering components of the cross - section exhibit a noticeable temperature dependence at low - energy neutrinos .",
    "our calculations reveal the same thermal effects as the hybrid approach based calculations .",
    "namely , the reaction threshold for inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering is removed at finite temperatures and the cross - section for low - energy neutrinos is significantly enhanced .",
    "however , the calculated cross - sections for @xmath0fe at low neutrino energies are several times larger than those obtained within the hybrid approach .",
    "we have shown that the discrepancy is due to the violation of brink s hypothesis in our approach .",
    "this is the main result of the present study .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated that the tqrpa approach can be used to study inelastic neutrino scattering off massive neutron - rich nuclei at finite temperatures .",
    "another advantage of our approach is that it incorporates the detailed balance principle , whereas in the hybrid approach detailed balance is violated .",
    "there are several directions to improve our approach . at present , its predictive power is limited by the phenomenological hamiltonian with schematic separable residual interactions .",
    "it would therefore be desirable to combine our tfd - based tqrpa method with self - consistent qrpa calculations based on more realistic effective interactions . for neutrino scattering and neutrino absorption reactions at zero temperature ,",
    "such calculations were performed recently within the relativistic nuclear density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "this improvement would also allow to take into account the effects of nuclear deformation . for supernova electron - capture rates in @xmath9-shell nuclei ,",
    "deformation was recently included in self - consistent qrpa calculations with the skyrme interaction  @xcite .",
    "the other direction of improvement is the inclusion of correlations beyond the tqrpa by taking into account the coupling of thermal phonons with more complex ( e.g. two - phonon ) configurations . at zero temperature",
    "this problem was considered within the qpm  @xcite by exploiting separable schematic effective interactions . however , with the separable approximation for the skyrme interaction  @xcite one could consider phonon coupling at finite temperatures within a self - consistent theory .    the collaboration with prof .  t.  s.  kosmas and dr .",
