    "naively , one might think of projective and conformal structures as formally similar , since both arise by defining a notion of equivalence on a geometric structure . however , the formal similarity is more substantial .",
    "for instance , kobayashi has shown  @xcite that both projective  and conformal structures admit a treatment as cartan geometries with @xmath12-graded lie algebras ( see  @xcite for background on cartan geometries ) . here",
    "we exploit the fact that both structures give rise to affine subspaces modelled on @xmath13 of the infinite - dimensional affine space @xmath14 of torsion - free connections on @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , it is a classical result due to weyl  @xcite that two torsion - free connections on @xmath11 are projectively equivalent if and only if their difference  thought of as a section of @xmath15  is pure trace .",
    "consequently , the representative connections of a projective structure @xmath3 on @xmath10 define an affine subspace @xmath16 which is modelled on @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , it follows from koszul s identity , that the torsion - free connections preserving a conformal structure @xmath4 $ ] on @xmath10 are of the form @xmath17 with @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 and where @xmath20 denotes the levi - civita connection of @xmath21 .",
    "hence , the space of torsion - free @xmath4$]-conformal connections on @xmath11 is an affine subspace @xmath22}(m)$ ] modelled on @xmath13 as well .",
    "it is an elementary computation to check that if @xmath22}(m)$ ] and @xmath16 intersect , then they do so in a unique point .",
    "therefore , we may ask if in general one can distinguish two points in @xmath23}(m)$ ] which are ` as close as possible ' .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "more precisely , one obtains a @xmath24-equivariant map @xmath25)\\mapsto \\alpha$ ] which sends a pair @xmath25)$ ] to an element @xmath26 which we may think of as the ` difference ' between @xmath3 and @xmath4 $ ] . in particular , if @xmath10 is oriented , we obtain a @xmath24-invariant functional @xmath27)=\\int_{m}|\\alpha|^n_g d \\mu_g.\\ ] ]",
    "fixing a projective structure @xmath3 on @xmath10 , we may consider the functional @xmath28 , which is a functional on the space @xmath29 of conformal structures on @xmath10 only .",
    "it is natural to study the infimum of @xmath0 among all conformal structures on @xmath10 , and to ask whether there is actually a minimising conformal structure which achieves this infimum .",
    "this infimum  which may be considered as a measure of how far @xmath3 deviates from being defined by a conformal connection  is a new global invariant for oriented projective manifolds . of particular interest is the case of surfaces where @xmath0 is just the square of the @xmath30-norm of @xmath31 taken with respect to @xmath4 $ ] and this is the case that we study in detail in this article .",
    "it turns out that in the surface case the functional @xmath0 also arises from a rather different viewpoint , which greatly simplifies the computation of its variational equations by using the technique of moving frames .    inspired by the twistorial construction of holomorphic projective structures by hitchin  @xcite , it was shown in  @xcite ,  @xcite how to construct a  twistor space  for smooth projective structures .",
    "the choice of a projective structure @xmath3 on an oriented surface @xmath32 induces a complex structure on the total space of the disk bundle @xmath33 whose sections are conformal structures on @xmath32 . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath2)$ ] can be interpreted as measuring the failure of @xmath4(\\sigma ) \\subset z$ ] to be a holomorphic curve in @xmath34 .",
    "we proceed to show that @xmath3 canonically defines an indefinite khler - einstein structure @xmath8 on a certain submanifold @xmath35 of the projectivised holomorphic cotangent bundle @xmath36 of @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , every conformal structure @xmath4 : \\sigma \\to z$ ] admits a lift @xmath6 } : \\sigma \\to y$ ] so that @xmath4 $ ] is a critical point for @xmath0  with respect to compactly supported variations  if and only if @xmath6 } : ( \\sigma,[g ] ) \\to ( y , h_y)$ ] is weakly conformal .",
    "in fact , in the compact case @xmath2)$ ] is , up to the topological constant @xmath37 , just the dirichlet energy of @xmath6}$ ] . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain the lower bound @xmath38}^*h_y\\ , d\\mu_g\\geq -2\\pi\\chi(\\sigma),\\ ] ] with equality if and only if @xmath3 is defined by a @xmath4$]-conformal connection .    looking for a class of projective structures",
    "for which @xmath0 admits critical points ( we also say conformal structures that are  _ extremal _ for @xmath3 ) , we turn our attention to the canonical rank two affine bundle @xmath39 whose sections are in one - to - one correspondence with the @xmath3-representative connections .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that @xmath3 canonically equips @xmath40 with a neutral signature anti - self - dual einstein metric @xmath41 , as well as a symplectic form @xmath42 , so that the endomorphism relating @xmath43 squares to become the identity map on @xmath44 . moreover , here we prove that a @xmath3-representative connection @xmath45 defining a timelike or spacelike minimal lagrangian immersion has the property that the conformal structure on @xmath32 defined by @xmath46 is extremal for @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , we show that in the compact case , a timelike or spacelike lagrangian connection @xmath45 is totally geodesic if and only if @xmath47 is the levi - civita connection of a metric of constant non - zero gauss curvature .",
    "in addition , we observe that a projectively flat connection @xmath45 defining a timelike or spacelike minimal lagrangian immersion gives rise to a holomorphic cubic differential on @xmath32 , where the complex structure is the one coming from the induced metric @xmath46 and the orientation . this allows to show that the only examples of such connections on the @xmath48-sphere are levi - civita connections of metrics of constant positive gauss - curvature .    the occurrence of holomorphic cubic differentials in projective differential geometry is not new . in his celebrated paper `` _ _ lie groups and teichmller space _ _ ''",
    "@xcite hitchin proposed a generalisation of teichmller space @xmath49 by identifying a connected component @xmath50  nowadays called the  _ hitchin component _  in the space of conjugacy classes of representations of @xmath51 into @xmath52 ) . here",
    "@xmath32 denotes a compact orientable surface whose genus exceeds one . using the theory of higgs bundles  @xcite and harmonic map techniques , hitchin showed that the choice of a complex structure @xmath53 on @xmath32 gives an identification @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the canonical bundle of @xmath32 with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "hitchin conjectured that @xmath56 is the space of conjugacy classes of monodromy representations of ( flat ) properly convex projective structures , a fact later confirmed by choi and goldman  @xcite ( the geometric interpretation of the hitchin component for @xmath57 is a topic of current interest , c.f .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite for recent results ) .",
    "teichmller space being parametrised by holomorphic quadratic differentials , one might ask if there is a unique choice of a complex structure ( or equivalently conformal structure when fixing an orientation ) on @xmath32 so that @xmath56 is parametrised in terms of cubic holomorphic differentials only .",
    "this is indeed the case , as was shown independently by loftin  @xcite and labourie  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and  @xcite for recent work treating the non - compact case and the case of convex polygons , as well as  @xcite treating the case of a general real split rank @xmath48 group ) .",
    "furthermore , the conformal structure @xmath4_{0}$ ] making the quadratic differential vanish admits an interpretation in terms of affine differential geometry , see in particular  @xcite .",
    "we will call @xmath4_0 $ ] the  _ canonical conformal structure _ of a properly convex compact oriented projective surface @xmath5 .    using the results of labourie  @xcite ,",
    "we show that the canonical conformal structure of a properly convex compact oriented projective surface @xmath5 is extremal for @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , there exists a @xmath3-representative connection @xmath45  unique up to pullback by @xmath3-preserving diffeomorphisms  which is a spacelike minimal lagrangian embedding .",
    "although we are currently unable to prove this , it is tempting to speculate that in the case of a properly convex compact oriented projective surface @xmath5 , the canonical conformal structure is in fact the unique minimiser ( and possibly even critical point ) of @xmath0 .    as a by - product of our ideas , we obtain a gauss  bonnet type identity for oriented projective surfaces , which we briefly discuss in appendix  [ ap : gb ]",
