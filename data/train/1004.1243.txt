    "the mechanism of particle acceleration and high - energy emission processes in the pulsar magnetospheres are one of the unresolved physics of the pulsar activities . the particle acceleration process and resultant high - energy @xmath13-ray emission process have been discussed with the polar cap model ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; daugherty & harding 1982 ) , the slot gap model ( arons 1981 ; harding , usov & muslimov 2005 ; harding et al .",
    "2008 ) and the outer gap model ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , b ; hirotani 2008 ; takata & chang 2009 ) .",
    "the polar cap model assumes the emission site close to the stellar surface above the polar cap , and the slot gap and the outer gap models assume the emission site in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "the different acceleration models have predicted the different properties of the @xmath13-ray emissions from the pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "the observations of the pulsar emitting electromagnetic radiation in the high - energy @xmath13-ray bands have been facilitated by recent space and ground based telescopes .",
    "in particular , the @xmath14 @xmath13-ray telescope has measured the @xmath13-ray emissions from @xmath15 pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 , 2009a , b ) , including 21 radio - loud , 17 radio - quiet and 8 millisecond pulsars .",
    "in addition , @xmath16 ( astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero ) has also reported the detection of @xmath13-ray emissions from 4 new pulsars with 4 candidates ( pellizzoni et al .",
    "2009 ) . in more higher energy regime , @xmath17 (",
    "major atmospheric gamma imaging cherenkov ) telescope has detected for the first time pulsed gamma - ray radiation above 25  gev from the crab pulsar ( aliu et al .",
    "these observations will be useful to discriminate between the emission models .",
    "for example , the @xmath14 telescope has measured the spectral properties above 10  gev with a better sensitivity than @xmath18 .",
    "it was found that the spectral shape of @xmath13-ray emissions from the vela pulsar is well fitted with a power low ( photon index @xmath191.5 ) plus exponential cut - off ( @xmath20  gev ) model .",
    "the discovered exponential cut - off feature predicts that the emissions from the outer magnetosphere ( abdo et al .",
    "2009c ) is more favored than the polar cap region ( daugherty & harding 1996 ) , which predicts a super exponential cut - off with the magnetic pair - creation .",
    "furthermore , the detection of the radiation above 25  gev bands associated with the crab pulsar has also predicted the high - energy emission in the outer magnetosphere ( aliu et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the pulse profiles observed by the @xmath14 telescope allow us to study the site of the @xmath13-ray emissions in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "venter et al . ( 2009 ) fitted the pulse profiles of the 8 millisecond pulsars with the geometries predicted by the different emission models .",
    "they showed that most of the pulse profiles can be best fit with the outer gap ( takata et al .",
    "2007 ; takata & chang 2007 ; tang et al . 2008 ) or the two pole caustic ( dyks & rudak 2003 ; dyks et al . 2004 ) geometries , which have a slab like geometry along the last - open field lines .",
    "however , they also found that the pulse profiles of two out of eight millisecond pulsars can not be fitted by either the geometries with the outer gap or the caustic models .",
    "they proposed a pair - starved polar cap model , in which the multiplicity of the pairs is not high enough to completely screen the electric field above the polar cap , and the particles are continuously accelerated up to high altitude over full open field line region .",
    "the increase of the @xmath13-ray pulsars allows us to perform a detail statistical study of the @xmath13-ray pulsars .",
    "in particular , the @xmath14 @xmath13-ray pulsars including millisecond pulsars will reveal the relation between the @xmath13-ray luminosity ( @xmath3 ) and the spin down power ( @xmath7 ) , for which @xmath21 with @xmath22 was predicted by @xmath18 measurements ( thompson 2004 ) .",
    "also , the @xmath14 @xmath13-ray pulsars will enable us to discuss the general trend of the relation among the spectral properties of the @xmath13-ray emissions ( e.g. the cut - off energy and photon index ) and the pulsar parameters ( e.g. rotation period and surface magnetic field ) .",
    "together with the observed pulse profiles and the spectra , these general properties of the @xmath13-ray emissions will discriminate between the @xmath13-ray emission models in the pulsar magnetospheres .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the @xmath13-ray emissions from the outer gap accelerator .",
    "we propose a new outer gap closure mechanism by the magnetic pair - creation process near the stellar surface .",
    "the pairs produced by the magnetic pair creation will be able to close the gap if the sufficiently strong surface multiple field exists and affects the dipole field near the surface . in section  [ closure ] , we first summarize results of gap closure process by photon - photon pair - creation process , and then we discuss our new gap closure mechanism by the magnetic pair - creation process . in section  [ outergap ]",
    ", we describe the model predictions of the properties of the @xmath13-ray emissions . in section  [ discussion ] , we will compare the model predictions with the results of the @xmath14 observations .",
    "we also discuss applicability of our model . in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we will summarize our gap closure model and predictions for the outer gap accelerator .",
    "the outer gap accelerator model was proposed by cheng , ho and ruderman ( 1986a , b ) , who argued that a large global current flow through the outer magnetosphere causes a charge depletion from the goldreich - julian charge density , which is defined by @xmath23 ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) with @xmath24 being the vector of the rotation axis and @xmath25 the magnetic field . in the charge depletion region",
    ", the non - corotational electric field along the magnetic field accelerates the charged particles , which result in the high energy @xmath13-ray emissions .",
    "this non - corotational electric field could be screened out by the discharge of the copious electron and positron pairs produced by the pair - creation process of the @xmath13-ray photons .",
    "the outer gap would be completely screened out in the trans - field direction , where the non - corotational electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field in the poloidal plane is equal to zero .",
    "this condition implies that the total potential ( corotational + non - corotational ) field is continuously connected to the corotational field outside the outer gap .",
    "zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) discussed the gap closure mechanism by the photon - photon pair - creation process between the high - energy @xmath13-rays emitted in the gap and the x - rays coming from the stellar surface .",
    "they estimated the typical gap thickness from the pair - creation condition @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the energy of the emitted @xmath13-ray photons in the outer gap and @xmath28 is the energy of the soft - photons from the stellar surface , and they obtained the fractional gap thickness as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the light cylinder radius , @xmath31 is the gap thickness in poloidal plane at @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the global stellar magnetic field in units of @xmath34  gauss .    the outer gap closure mechanism with the photon - photon pair - creation process in the trans - field direction have also been discussed by solving the electrodynamics in the outer gap with 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional geometry ( takata , shibata and hirotani 2004 ; hirotani 2006a , b ; hirotani 2008 ) . for example , hirotani ( 2006a ) demonstrated that the outer gap for the young pulsar , the crab pulsar , is almost screened out in the trans - field direction at the fractional gap thickness of @xmath35 ( figure 6 in hirotani 2006a ) .",
    "for mature pulsars such like gemiga , on the other hand , takata and chang ( 2009 ) argued that the photon - photon pair - creation process will be insufficient in the outer magnetosphere and the outer gap could occupy entire region between the last - open field lines and the critical field lines that have the null charge point at the light cylinder .      in this paper",
    ", we propose a possible gap closure mechanism , in which the magnetic par - creation process near the stellar surface supplies the electron and positron pairs to close the outer gap in the trans - field direction .",
    "it has been proposed that the magnetic field near the stellar surface is enhanced by the strong multiple magnetic field , although the global magnetic field is well described by the dipole field ( blandford et al .",
    "1983 ; romani 1990 ; ruderman 1991 ) .",
    "the neutron star magnetic field will be produced by a current flowing the crust , which has a thickness of @xmath36 .",
    "it was suggested that the magnetic structure near the stellar surface is super position of clumps resolved into multiples of characteristic of the order of @xmath37 ( arons 1993 ; zhang & cheng 2003 ) .",
    "if the clumps cover whole stellar surface , the strength of the stellar magnetic field is order of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the strength of dipole magnetic field determined by the observed rotation period @xmath40 and the period derivative @xmath41 , and @xmath42 and 2 represent coherent and incoherent superposition of the magnetic momentum of the clump , respectively .",
    "this model indicates the strength of the stellar magnetic field can take easily @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , even in the millisecond pulsar , the magnetic field near the star surface will be close to @xmath44  gauss , and the magnetic pair - creation process will take place close to the stellar surface .",
    "we will argue that the @xmath13-rays emitted near the stellar surface is converted into the pairs via the magnetic pair - creation process above the height ( @xmath45 ) measured from the last - open field line . in equation  ( [ height ] ) , we will estimate the height , @xmath45 , above which the pair - creation process takes place .",
    "the important conditions for closing the outer gap by the pairs produced by the magnetic pair - creation process near the stellar surface are as follows ; ( 1 ) the gap was not closed by the photon - photon pair - creation process below the height @xmath45 ( c.f .",
    "section  [ limit ] ) , ( 2 ) the local magnetic field lines near the stellar surface is bending away from the last - open field lines ( see below and figure  [ pulsar ] ) due to the strong multiple fields , and ( 3 ) some of magnetic pairs migrate into outer magnetosphere .",
    "the second condition is required to produce outflows of the magnetic pairs .",
    "figure  [ pulsar1 ] and  [ pulsar ] represent the schematic view of the outer magnetosphere and of the magnetic structure near the stellar surface , which is favored in this study , respectively . in the outer magnetosphere ,",
    "the photon - photon pair - production process create pairs , which are separated by the accelerating electric field . inward propagating particles",
    "will emit the @xmath13-ray photons toward the strong magnetic field region near the stellar surface . as demonstrated by the electrodynamic study ( e.g. hirotani 2006a ) , the electric field below null charge surface",
    "are significantly reduced by the pairs and arises with a very weak field .",
    "below the null charge surface , therefore , the curvature energy loss will not be able to be compensated by the acceleration of the electric field in the gap ( c.f .",
    "section  [ valid ] ) , and the incoming particles loose their energy by the curvature radiation .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is a minimum energy of the curvature photons , which does not depend on any pulsar parameters and the curvature radius of the local magnetic field . assuming that the curvature loss dominates the energy gain due to the acceleration by the electric field , the evolution of the lorentz factor may be described as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the curvature radius .",
    "close to the null charge surface , the incoming particles lose their energy with a time scale smaller than the time scale of travelling to the stellar surface , because the lorentz factor is high enough . as decreasing the lorentz factor of the particles ,",
    "the curvature energy loss time scale becomes comparable to the crossing time scale of @xmath48 .",
    "in such a case , equation of motion  ( [ loss ] ) implies @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial lorentz factor . if @xmath51 , the typical lorentz factor of the particles below the null charge surface becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the curvature radius in units of @xmath54  cm .    the lorentz factor ( [ lorent ] ) gives the minimum energy of the curvature photons , which does not depend on any pulsar parameters , that @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the fine structure constant .",
    "we expect that the incoming electrons will mainly emit the curvature photons with an energy @xmath57  mev between the stellar surface and the null charge surface .",
    "some of 100  mev photons emitted below the null charge surface pass through vicinity of the stellar surface . applying the static dipole field geometry and @xmath58 ,",
    "for example , the trajectory of the 100  mev photons emitted below @xmath59  cm on the last - open filed line will cross the magnetic pole below @xmath60  cm .",
    "therefore , it is expected almost all 100  mev photons emitted below @xmath59  cm will be converted into pairs with a strong magnetic field of @xmath61  gauss .",
    "we find that an incoming particle emits about @xmath62 photons before reaching the stellar surface below @xmath59  cm .    for the millisecond pulsars , the 100  mev curvature photons",
    "could be converted into the pairs with a strong multiple magnetic field , which could acquire @xmath44  gauss , at very close to the stellar surface . with the static dipole field geometry ,",
    "the curvature photons emitted blow @xmath63  cm is propagating toward the magnetic pole for the typical rotation period of @xmath64  ms .",
    "an incoming particle will emit @xmath65 of @xmath0  mev photons below @xmath66  cm    for the canonical pulsar , the pairs created by the magnetic pair - creation process of 100  mev photons can also emit the soft @xmath13-rays via the synchrotron radiation , which may further generate new pairs . with the typical lorentz factor of @xmath67 ,",
    "one pair emits about 1@xmath6810 synchrotron photons with a typical energy of @xmath69  mev .",
    "this @xmath685  mev synchrotron photons also could be converted into pairs with a strong local magnetic field @xmath70  gauss near the stellar surface , where the magnetic field will be enhanced by the multiple magnetic field .",
    "this implies the resultant multiplicity of an incoming particles , which was accelerated in the outer gap , could be @xmath71 for the canonical pulsars .",
    "the mean free path of the magnetic pair - creation process of the photon with the energy @xmath27 is described as ( erber 1966;ruderman & surtherland 1975 ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74  gauss and @xmath75 with @xmath76 is the angle between the direction of the propagating for the photon and the magnetic field .",
    "the exponential dependency of the mean - free path on the photon energy @xmath27 and the angle @xmath76 implies that most of emitted photons will be converted into pairs if the condition that @xmath77 is satisfied . using the magnetic pair - creation condition",
    ", we can estimate height measured from the last open field line , above which the magnetic pair - creation process of the photons with @xmath57  mev becomes important process .",
    "the collision angle @xmath76 is approximately described as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the propagating distance of a photon from the emission point , and @xmath80 is height measured from the last - open field line .",
    "the magnetic pair - creation condition implies that the curvature photons with an energy @xmath0  mev will be converted into the pairs above the height @xmath81 where @xmath82 expresses the critical radial distance below which the magnetic pair - creation process becomes to be important and it will be @xmath83 for the canonical pulsars and @xmath84 for the millisecond pulsars . in addition ,",
    "@xmath85 , @xmath86 is the strength of the magnetic field at the pair - creation position in units of @xmath34  gauss , and we used @xmath87 . rescaling the thickness at the stellar radius using the magnetic flux conservation , we obtain @xmath88 with @xmath89 being the stellar radius .",
    "as we have discussed above , the incoming particles will create pairs above the height @xmath45 , which is described by equation  ( [ height ] ) , via the magnetic pair - creation process near the stellar surface , and the multiplicity could acquire @xmath1 for the canonical pulsars and @xmath90 for the millisecond pulsars .",
    "although it is expected most of the created pairs have inward momentum and migrate toward the star , it may be possible that small fraction of the created pairs are produced with an outgoing momentum and migrate into outer magnetosphere , as discussed below .",
    "in fact , about @xmath91 pairs out of @xmath1 will be enough to close the outer gap accelerator in the trans - field direction everywhere in the outer magnetosphere .    the magnetic pairs would be produced with an outgoing momentum if the magnetic structure near the stellar surface is affected by the strong multiple field , as illustrated in figure  [ pulsar ] , which shows how some pairs can acquire the outgoing momentum due to the geometry of the local magnetic field lines .",
    "in fact , it is required that the magnetic field ( thick dashed - lines ) on the pair - creation points are bending away from the last - open field line due to a strong multiple field ( solid - dashed line ) .",
    "the solid curved lines represent the global field which are not affected by the local magnetic field , and thin dashed - lines represent the geometry without the multiple field .",
    "the 100  mev curvature photons ( solid arrows ) emitted by the incoming particles , which were accelerated inside the outer gap , are converted into the pairs via the magnetic pair - creation above height , @xmath45 described by equation  ( [ height ] ) . for the canonical pulsars , the synchrotron radiation of the created pairs will produces @xmath685  mev photons ( dashed arrows ) , which could be converted into new pairs by a strong magnetic field near the stellar surface . if the direction of the magnetic field at the pair - creation positions is bending away from the last - open field line , it is possible that the collision angle ( denoted as @xmath92 in the figure  [ pulsar ] ) between the photons and the magnetic field line becomes larger than @xmath93 , implying the created pair has the outgoing momentum .",
    "we note that ( 1 ) because the position of the pair - creation point is determined by the value @xmath94 , and ( 2 ) because the collision angle changes from a smaller value to a larger value as the photon propagate toward the stellar surface , the position with the collision angle smaller than @xmath95 is preferentially chosen as the pair - creation point , although @xmath96 gives the same values with , for example , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "however , the magnetic field also increases as the photons propagate toward the stellar surface , implying the strength of the magnetic field is bigger for the position with @xmath99 than that with @xmath97 . as a result , it will be possible that some photons do not have enough energy to produce the pairs with the magnetic field at the position with @xmath97 , but do to produce the pairs at the position with @xmath99 . on these ground",
    ", some created pairs will be able to have the outgoing momentum , if the local magnetic field is bending away from the last - open field line .    with the magnetic field structure bending away from the last - open field line",
    ", the incoming particles from the outer gap could emit the 100  mev curvature photons toward lower altitude , and therefore could make pairs at lower altitude , implying the magnetic pair - creation process could occur inside the gap if the inner boundary is located close to the stellar surface .",
    "the created pairs will be discharged by the small electric field along the magnetic field and this discharge will partially screen the electric field . because the created pairs lose their perpendicular momentum within very short distance , the lorentz factor after loosing the perpendicular momentum is @xmath100 .",
    "the magnetic pairs will screen the electric field near the inner boundary so that the potential drop between the inner boundary and the point , below which the magnetic pair - creation process is occurred , is reduced to @xmath101  volts .",
    "if all field lines in the polar cap region are bending toward the last - open field line , the outgoing magnetic pairs are not expected because the collision angle is always @xmath102 .",
    "in such a case , all pairs created by the magnetic pair - creation process will have an inward momentum , implying the photon - photon pair - creation process will be only possible mechanism to close the outer gap .",
    "our gap closure process is summarized as follows ;    1 .",
    "the incoming particles emit @xmath68100  mev photons below the null charge surface , 2 .",
    "the @xmath68100mev photons emitted toward the stellar surface will produce the pairs via the magnetic pair - creation process ( @xmath1 ) above the height @xmath45 estimated by equation ( [ height ] ) , and 3 .   if some fraction of the created pairs will be produced with an outgoing momentum due to the geometry of the local magnetic field , then the outgoing pairs close the outer gap in the trans - field direction everywhere in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "we will discuss the applicability of the present model in section  [ limit ] .",
    "applying equation  ( [ height ] ) as the typical thickness of the gap rescaled at the radial distance @xmath103 with the dipole field geometry , we define the fractional gap thickness on the stellar surface as @xmath104 with @xmath105    applying the fractional gap thickness to the acceleration and curvature emission process beyond the null charge surface , we discuss the expected properties of the @xmath13-ray radiation from the outer gap closed by the magnetic pair - creation process . the typical magnitude of the electric field in the gap beyond the null charge surface is given by @xmath106 which can accelerate the electrons and positrons up to @xmath107 where we used @xmath108 in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "we find that the maximum lorentz factor does not depend on the rotational period .",
    "the typical energy of the curvature radiation by the accelerated particles in the outer magnetosphere is @xmath109 because the efficiency of the emission is significantly reduced above the energy @xmath110 , we expect that the @xmath13-ray spectrum has the cut - off energy of @xmath110 .",
    "the total current flowing in the gap is order of @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the goldreich - julain current . using the total potential drop in the gap of @xmath113",
    ", we can estimate the @xmath13-ray luminosity as @xmath114",
    "the present model predicts the cut - off energy and the luminosity of the @xmath13-ray emissions are related with the stellar magnetic field and the rotation period as @xmath115 of equation  ( [ cut - off ] ) and @xmath116 of equation  ( [ lumi ] ) , respectively .",
    "we plots the our predictions with the observations on the cut - off energy in figure  [ cutoff ] and on the luminosity in figure  [ lumin ] . in the figures ,",
    "the circle and triangle symbols represent the radio - selected and @xmath13-ray selected @xmath13-ray pulsars , and the squares are the millisecond pulsars .",
    "we can see that the slope of the model prediction is consistent with the observations for both canonical pulsars and millisecond pulsars .    in the present outer gap model , the properties of the @xmath13-ray emissions depend on the local parameters @xmath117 , which is determined by the local magnetic structure .",
    "in fact , we adopted @xmath118 for the canonical @xmath13-ray pulsars and @xmath119 for the millisecond pulsars in figures  [ cutoff ] and  [ lumin ] .",
    "the strength of the multiple field at a distance @xmath120 from the stellar surface may be expressed as @xmath121^{-(m+1)}$ ] , where @xmath122 is the strength of the multiple field at the stellar surface and @xmath123  cm is the thickness of the crust , the index @xmath124 is the multiplicity .",
    "if we consider the localized dipole field ( @xmath125 ) , @xmath121^{-3}$ ] , with @xmath126  gauss , this localized dipole field becomes same order of magnitude with the global dipole field at about one stellar radius from the stellar surface , because @xmath127 with @xmath128  cm and because the global dipole field becomes @xmath129 at @xmath130 .",
    "if the radial distance below which the magnetic pair - creation process takes place is @xmath131 , the strength of the magnetic field at @xmath132 is @xmath133  gauss and the curvature radius of the multiple field will be @xmath134  cm .",
    "this implies the local parameter of @xmath135 , which explains @xmath136 in figures  [ cutoff ] and  [ lumin ] . for the millisecond pulsars ,",
    "it is expected that the magnetic par - creation of the photons with the energy @xmath57  mev is possible only at very close to the stellar surface ( @xmath137 ) , because the field strength is about three or four order of magnitude smaller than that of the canonical pulsars .",
    "if we adopt @xmath138  gauss as the strength of the multiple field on the stellar surface and @xmath139  cm as the curvature radius of the multiple field , we obtain @xmath140 .",
    "as figures  [ cutoff ] and  [ lumin ] show , the present model predicts that the local parameter @xmath141 discriminates the canonical and the millisecond pulsars as the different populations on the plots of the cut - off energy @xmath4 versus @xmath142 and of the luminosity @xmath3 versus @xmath143 . from equations  ( [ cut - off ] ) and  ( [ lumi ] ) ,",
    "on the other hand , one can see that @xmath144 does not include the local factor @xmath145 .",
    "more strictly speaking , the quantities @xmath146 carries away the dependency on the gap thickness @xmath147 , which depends on the local parameters @xmath148 , because @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we then obtain the relation that @xmath151 figure  [ basic ] compares the model prediction and the observations for each pulsar .",
    "figure  [ basic ] shows that both canonical pulsars and millisecond pulsars are consistent with the line of @xmath152 .",

    "those pulsars will be expected to distribute around solid line in figure  [ basic ] , and two populations , i.e. the canonical and millisecond pulsars , will be continuously connected in the plot .    recasting the cut - off energy @xmath4 given by equation  ( [ cut - off ] ) and the @xmath13-ray luminosity @xmath3 given by equation  ( [ lumi ] ) as a function of the spin down age @xmath154",

    "one can see that the proportionality coefficients @xmath165 in equation  ( [ spcut ] ) and @xmath166 in equation  ( [ splumi ] ) have less dependency on the pulsar populations .",

    "we describe applicability of our model to the pulsars .",
    "the present gap closure model invokes the condition that the thickness @xmath45 , above which the magnetic pair - creation becomes to be important , is less than the thickness , at which the gap is closed by the photon - photon pair - creation process . to discuss the applicability to the pulsars , for example ,",

    "they estimate the fractional gap thickness , which is defined by the ratio between the typical gap thickness at @xmath32 and the light radius , as @xmath175 .",
    "we recast our fractional gap thickness defined in equation  ( [ frac ] ) into one in the sense of the definition by zhang & chang ( 1997 ) .",
    "because the trans - field thickness of the magnetic flux tube is approximately proportional to @xmath176 , the fractional gap thickness is described by @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is defined by equation  ( [ frac ] ) .",
    "we compare the predicted thicknesses of @xmath179 and @xmath180 for 36 canonical @xmath13-ray pulsars in table  1 and for 8 millisecond @xmath13-ray pulsars in table  2 .",
    "we find that the pulsars with a larger spin down luminosity , such like psr j0534 + 2200 ( the crab pulsar ) , has @xmath181 . as table  1 and",
    "table  2 show , on the other hand , the mature pulsars , such like psr j0633 + 1746 ( the geminga pulsar ) , and the millisecond pulsars , who show a smaller spin down power , indicate @xmath182",
    ".    the present gap closure process with the magnetic pair - creation process will be applicable for the pulsars whose have @xmath183 , that is , the predicted gap thickness @xmath180 is comparable with or slightly less than @xmath179 of the photon - photon pair - creation process .",
    "the condition that @xmath181 implies that the efficient photon - photon pair - creation will definitely close the gap before the gap reaches the thickness @xmath180 . for the case @xmath182 ,",
    "on the other hand , the outer gap must be thicker than @xmath178 , but the gap may be closed by magnetic pair - creation process with the thickness at which the photon - photon pair - creation is initiated in the gap .",
    "equating the fractional gap thickness @xmath184 and @xmath180 , it may be suggested that the switching of the gap closure mechanism takes palace at @xmath185 indicating the photon - photon pair - creation closes the gap for the pulsars with @xmath186 , while the magnetic pair - creation may close the gap for @xmath187 .      in the present model ,",
    "we assume that the energy loss due to the curvature radiation below the null charge surface is not compensated by the acceleration of the electric field in the gap . for simplicity , we assume that the electric field decreases quadratically along the field lines below the null charge surface toward the inner boundary ; @xmath188 where @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the radial distance to the inner boundary and the null charge point , respectively , and @xmath191 is the electric field at the null charge point , which is characterized by equation  ( [ accfield ] ) . if the inner boundary is located @xmath192 stellar radius from the stellar surface , the acceleration field is reduced to @xmath193 near the inner boundary .",
    "applying the typical electric field described by equation  ( [ accfield ] ) at the null charge point , a particle gains energy by the electric field with a rate of @xmath194 on the other hand , the particles having the lorentz factor expressed by equation  ( [ lorent ] ) loose their energy via the curvature radiation with a rate of @xmath195 indicating the energy loss by the curvature radiation dominates the energy gain by the acceleration of the electric field .",
    "in fact , ( 1 ) the electrodynamic model expects the electric field will decreases more rapidly below the null charge surface than the quadratic expression ( hirotani 2006a ) or ( 2 ) the inner boundary will located far from the stellar surface for the small current case .",
    "therefore we can safely assume that the energy loss due to the curvature radiation below the null charge surface is not compensated by the acceleration of the electric field .",
    "we briefly summarize the difference in the predicted @xmath13-ray luminosity between the present model and the model investigated by zhang & cheng  ( 1997 ) .",
    "zhang & cheng  ( 1997 ) predicted the fractional gap thickness @xmath196 of the outer gap closed by the photon - photon pair - creation process in the outer magnetosphere . with this model ,",
    "the @xmath13-ray luminosity depends on the spin down power as @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath13-ray luminosity is less dependent on the spin down power .",
    "later , they developed their gap model by taking into account the effects of the inclination angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic axis ( zhang et al .",
    "they argued that the fractional gap thickness and the resultant @xmath13-ray luminosity depend on the inclination angle .",
    "they assumed that when the fractional gap thickness goes to unity , then the @xmath13-ray luminosity approaches to the spin down power .",
    "therefore , the @xmath13-ray luminosity bounded between @xmath198 and @xmath7 depending on the inclination angle .",
    "they carried out a monte carlo simulating to calculate the @xmath13-ray luminosity by assuming that the inclination angle is randomly distributed . as a result",
    ", they obtained the relation that @xmath21 with an index of @xmath199 . in the present model , on the other hand , the fractional gap thickness @xmath200 has a less dependency on the rotational period compared with the model of zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) , in which @xmath201 . as a result , without introducing the effects of the inclination angle , the present model predicts the relation of @xmath202 with more steep index of @xmath203 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the outer gap accelerator model closed by magnetic pair - creation process .",
    "we argued that below null charge surface , the curvature loss is not compensated by the acceleration due to the electric field in the gap .",
    "in such a case , the incoming particles , which were produced in the outer magnetosphere , will emit curvature photons with about @xmath204  mev .",
    "the 100  mev curvature photos propagating toward the stellar surface will be converted into pairs by the pair - creation process with the strong local magnetic field near the stellar surface , where the multiple magnetic field affects to the global field lines . for the canonical pulsar ,",
    "the synchrotron radiation of the created pairs produce @xmath685  mev photon , which will be furthermore converted into pairs . as a result ,",
    "multiplicity of an incoming particle could acquire @xmath1 . with the local field lines bending away from the last - open field line ( such as illustrated in figure  [ pulsar ] )",
    ", the created pairs via the magnetic pair - creation process can have the outgoing momentum and migrate into the outer magnetosphere .",
    "if @xmath91 pairs out of @xmath1 migrate outward to the outer magnetosphere , those pairs could close the outer gap accelerator . according to this scenario ,",
    "the main results of this paper are as follows .",
    "the fractional thickness of the outer gap becomes @xmath205 , which has a less dependency on the rotational period compared with the outer gap model proposed by zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) . with the present model , the spectral properties of the @xmath13-ray emissions depend on the local parameter @xmath206 , which is determined by the local magnetic structure near the star .",
    "we expect that the local parameter @xmath148 takes a vale of @xmath207 for the canonical pulsars and @xmath208 for the millisecond pulsars ( figures  [ cutoff ] and  [ lumin ] ) .",
    "the present model predicts that the canonical pulsars and the millisecond pulsars are connected in the plots of @xmath209 versus @xmath210 , in which the effect of the fractional gap thickness is carried away ( figure  [ basic ] ) .",
    "the present model predicts that the cut - off energy ( @xmath4 ) and the @xmath13-ray luminosity ( @xmath3 ) depend on the spin down age or the spin down power as @xmath211 and @xmath212 or @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( figures  [ age - cutoff]-[spin - lumi ] ) .",
    "in addition to the cut - off energy and @xmath13-ray luminosity , which have been discussed in this paper , the @xmath14 @xmath13-ray telescope provides the photon index of @xmath13-ray spectrum and the pulse profiles for each pulsar ( abdo et al .",
    "it must be important to discuss the photon index and the pulse profile with the acceleration model , because they will contain information of the electric structure ( e.g. the distribution of the electric field ) in the acceleration region and the three - dimensional geometry of the emission region ( e.g. romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ; cheng , ruderman & zhang 2000 ; spitkovsky 2006 ) .",
    "however , a more detail model , which has to consider the electrodynamics in the gap and three - dimensional structure , is required to study the shape of the @xmath13-ray spectra and the pulse profiles .",
    "studying the emission properties with the electrodynamics in the present outer gap closure model will be done in the subsequent papers .",
