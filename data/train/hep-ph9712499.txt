    "supersymmetry ( susy ) provides an interesting framework for stabilizing the electroweak scale against radiative corrections .",
    "a realistic realization of this idea is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the model with minimal field content in which all the standard model particles have their superpartners . in the mssm ,",
    "however , the mechanism for susy breaking is not specified , but is simply parametrized by introducing a large number of soft susy breaking parameters by hand . the mssm is therefore best viewed as the low energy effective theory of some more fundamental theory , which must give a phenomenologically viable explanation of the origin of susy breaking .",
    "models with gauge - mediated susy breaking  @xcite are candidates for such a theory , and provide an appealing way to generate susy breaking soft terms in the mssm lagrangian . in these models ,",
    "susy breaking originates in a dynamical susy breaking sector and is then mediated via gauge interactions to the mssm sector .",
    "the susy breaking mechanism does not distinguish between flavors , and so , in the mssm sector , all scalars with identical gauge quantum numbers have the same susy breaking mass ( at the scale where the susy breaking fields are integrated out ) .",
    "thus , the universality of squark and slepton masses at some scale is guaranteed , and serious susy flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) problems can be evaded .    to preserve the natural suppression of fcncs in gauge - mediated susy breaking models , it is essential that no large intergenerational scalar mixing terms be introduced by supergravity contributions . in the absence of assumptions concerning the flavor structure of such supergravity contributions ,",
    "these mixing terms are expected to be of order the gravitino mass @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the scale of dynamical supersymmetry breaking , and @xmath3 is the planck mass .",
    "fcnc constraints then require @xmath4 .",
    "the gravitino is therefore the lightest supersymmetric particle , which has a number of important implications for collider phenomenology .",
    "first , the lightest standard model superpartner is now the next lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) and eventually decays into its standard model partner and the gravitino .",
    "the nlsp may then be charged or colored , as astrophysical and other constraints on such particles are thereby evaded .",
    "second , the nlsp may be stable or unstable in collider experiments , depending on @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath5 is high enough , decays to the gravitino is suppressed , and the nlsp decays outside the detector .",
    "the possible collider phenomena in gauge - mediated models are largely determined by the character of the nlsp .",
    "typically , in these models the nlsp is either the lightest neutralino or the stau mass eigenstate @xmath6 . and",
    "@xmath7 if they are sufficiently degenerate with @xmath6 . ] as this particle may be either long- or short - lived , there are four broad possibilities . if the nlsp is a long - lived neutralino , the susy signatures are the conventional @xmath8 signals and are identical to those present in gravity - mediated models with @xmath9-parity conservation .",
    "if the nlsp is a short - lived neutralino , superparticle production typically results in hard photons , a signal that has also been studied in great detail  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the nlsp could be the stau . in the case of a short - lived stau nlsp",
    ", there are a number of interesting new signatures , which have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", we explore the remaining possible scenario , in which the nlsp is a long - lived stau .",
    "this scenario is in fact realized in large portions of the parameter space : as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the stau is often the nlsp in models with non - minimal messenger sectors , and it is stable for @xmath10 , as is also the case in many models , including , for example , the gauge mediation models of ref .  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the familiar @xmath8 and hard photon signals are absent .",
    "however , susy may manifest itself at colliders through a number of spectacular new phenomena .",
    "for example , staus , as massive charged particles , may be slow and appear as highly ionizing tracks  @xcite . if , on the other hand , the staus are quite relativistic , they can not be distinguished from muons , and we may have excesses of dimuon or multi - lepton events as a result of superparticle production .    in this paper , we present a detailed discussion of the prospects for susy discovery in this scenario , and estimate the discovery reach for a variety of signatures . at present ,",
    "the most stringent bound on these scenarios comes from searches for stable charged particles at lep  @xcite .",
    "such searches , using combined data from runs with center of mass energies up to @xmath11 , yield the limit @xmath12  @xcite , where no degeneracy between generations is assumed . in this study",
    ", we begin by considering possible probes from tevatron run i data with @xmath13 and an integrated luminosity of @xmath14 . working within a specific , well - motivated model",
    ", we find that this currently available data probes regions of parameter space beyond the current lep bound and even beyond the final lep ii kinematic limit .",
    "we then consider possible improvements at tevatron run ii and the possible tev33 upgrade . as a number of signals are essentially background - free , the prospects for improvement are especially bright . for @xmath15 , and",
    "integrated luminosities of @xmath16 , 10 , and @xmath0 , we find that susy may be discovered for right - handed slepton masses of 110 , 180 , and 230 gev and wino masses of 310 , 370 , and 420 gev , respectively .",
    "while exact discovery reaches must await detailed experimental analyses beyond the scope of this study , these results indicate that the prospects for such searches are promising , as future tevatron runs will extend current search boundaries far into ranges typically expected for superpartner masses .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we briefly review the framework of gauge - mediated supersymmetric models .",
    "we describe a particular , well - motivated model that displays many of the generic features of gauge mediation models , and which we will use throughout the rest of the paper . in the subsequent sections , we explore three new signatures for long - lived staus . for each",
    ", we first estimate the discovery reach in terms of physical slepton and gaugino masses . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ionization ] , we discuss the possibility of detecting the highly ionizing tracks of heavy charged nlsps . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dimuon ] , we consider a possible excess of dimuon - like events due to the pair production of @xmath17 .",

    "we then discuss the multi - lepton signal in sec .",

    "the probes discussed in the following sections have relevance for many models , both supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric , with charged particles that are stable within the detector , and thus they have wide applicability . even within the framework of susy , such particles are possible in a variety of settings . however , among susy scenarios with long - lived charged particles , by far the most natural are models with gauge - mediated susy breaking , where the nlsp may be charged and decays to the gravitino with macroscopic decay lengths for a large range of parameters .- parity violating couplings . ] in this section , we will discuss these gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios , and determine what parameter ranges lead to the long - lived charged particle scenario .    in the general framework of gauge mediation , any of the mssm superpartners could in principle",
    "be the nlsp and stable in collider detectors .",
    "for concreteness , and to obtain quantitative results , we will specify a particular , well - motivated model . in this section",
    ", we briefly review this simple and calculable model , which we will use to determine the promise of various charged nlsp signatures . in doing so , we define our conventions and notation , and introduce the parameters that will play a central role in the following discussions .",
    "further details of this model may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the class of gauge mediation models we consider ,",
    "there are three sectors : the dynamical susy breaking ( dsb ) sector , the messenger sector , and the mssm sector . in the first , the @xmath18 component of some chiral superfield condenses , generating a vacuum expectation value @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath5 determines both the mass of the gravitino    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the reduced planck mass , and the strength of its interactions through , for example ,    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the longitudinal component of the gravitino , the goldstino .",
    "this dynamical susy breaking is mediated by two - loop effects to the messenger sector , which contains a singlet field @xmath24 , and , we will assume , @xmath25 pairs of vector - like @xmath26 representations of su(5 ) , that is , @xmath25 vector - like representations of su(2)@xmath27 doublets , and @xmath25 vector - like representations of su(3)@xmath28 triplets , where su(2)@xmath27 and su(3)@xmath28 are the standard model gauge groups .",
    "( such messenger field content preserves gauge coupling unification .",
    "vector - like representations @xmath29 of su(5 ) may also be present , and each is equivalent to 3 vector - like @xmath26 representations for the following discussion . )",
    "the scalar and auxiliary components of the singlet field then get vacuum expectation values @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , which generate susy breaking masses for the @xmath25 vector - like fields .",
    "we denote the scale of these masses , the messenger scale , by @xmath32 .    finally , once the messenger fields are integrated out at the scale @xmath32 , soft susy breaking masses for the superparticles in the mssm sector are generated . letting    @xmath33    and assuming @xmath34 , we find that one - loop diagrams induce gaugino masses    @xmath35    where @xmath36 for the u(1)@xmath37 , su(2)@xmath27 , and su(3)@xmath28 groups , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",

    "finally , trilinear scalar couplings ( @xmath46 terms ) are also induced , but are highly suppressed , as they are generated at two - loops , but have dimensions of mass , not mass squared .",
    "they may be taken to vanish at the scale @xmath47 .",
    "once the boundary conditions are given at the messenger scale @xmath32 , susy breaking parameters at the electroweak scale can be obtained by renormalization group ( rg ) evolution . in particular , the higgs mass squared can be driven negative by the large top yukawa coupling constant , and hence break electroweak symmetry . in our analysis , we do not specify the mechanism by which the supersymmetric higgs mass @xmath48 and susy breaking higgs mixing mass @xmath49 are generated .",
    "several attempts to explain the origin of these parameters may be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "here we regard them as free parameters .",
    "we then fix one combination of them by demanding the correct value of the fermi constant using the tree - level higgs potential .",
    "the remaining freedom may be specified by choosing @xmath50 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral higgs scalars , and @xmath51 , where we follow the conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite in defining the sign of @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the simple model we have defined has 4 + 1 free parameters : , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( and hence @xmath32 and @xmath54 ) are of the same order .",
    "however , in general , there may be a hierarchy between them .",
    "for example , if the coupling constant for the @xmath55 term in the superpotential is small , and all other couplings in the superpotential are @xmath56 , @xmath52 is enhanced relative to @xmath31 , resulting in @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "thus , in our analysis , we treat @xmath32 and @xmath54 as independent parameters . ]",
    "@xmath58    in this model with the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking condition , the mass eigenvalues and mixing parameters for all superparticles are determined once we fix these parameters .",
    "while the determination of susy parameters at the electroweak scale requires detailed calculation , it is useful to discuss the qualitative features of the superparticle spectrum . in the model described above , usually @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ m_gaugino ] ) , gaugino masses are proportional to the corresponding gauge coupling constants , and hence @xmath60 . as a result , @xmath61 with mass @xmath62 , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 with masses @xmath65 .",
    "in the scalar sector , sfermion masses are primarily proportional to the relevant gauge coupling constants .",
    "therefore , squarks are typically much heavier than sleptons , and right - handed sleptons , which have only u(1)@xmath37 quantum numbers , are the lightest sfermions .",
    "the sleptons @xmath66 and @xmath7 are almost degenerate , as yukawa coupling effects are negligibly small . on the contrary",
    ", the tau yukawa coupling may significantly lower the lighter stau mass through both rg evolution and left - right mixing .",
    "these effects are enhanced for large @xmath50 .",
    "the lightest scalar is thus the lighter stau @xmath6 , which is predominantly @xmath67 .",
    "we are interested in the case where @xmath68 and @xmath6 is the nlsp .",
    "this relation is most strongly and obviously dependent on @xmath25 .",
    "as one can see in eqs .",
    "( [ m_gaugino ] ) and ( [ m_sf ] ) , at the messenger scale , @xmath69 , while @xmath70 ; thus , large @xmath25 reduces @xmath71 .",
    "there is also an important dependence on @xmath47 , as rg evolution increases right - handed slepton masses relative to gaugino masses , and so large values of @xmath32 increase @xmath71 .",
    "as noted above , large values of @xmath50 decrease @xmath72 and so reduce @xmath71 .",
    "finally , the ratio @xmath73 is independent of @xmath54 and @xmath51 to the extent that the relation @xmath74 is valid , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the soft susy breaking parameters .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmessn5 ] , we show contours of @xmath77 in the @xmath78 plane for various @xmath50 and @xmath79 .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite . ) the shaded region is excluded by the requirement that the gauge coupling constants remain perturbative up to the gut scale @xmath80 under two - loop rg evolution .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are only approximately the physical @xmath6 and @xmath81 masses because of mixing effects and @xmath82-term contributions , and , in particular , the difference between @xmath75 and @xmath72 may be large for high @xmath50 .",
    "however , this figure gives a qualitative picture of the parameter region where @xmath6 is the nlsp .",
    "for a minimal messenger sector with @xmath83 , @xmath6 is not the nlsp ( unless @xmath50 is large  @xcite ) .",
    "however , for @xmath84 , @xmath6 is the nlsp for a wide range of parameter space .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : srm1 ] and [ fig : slm2 ] , we give contour plots of the soft susy breaking parameter ratios @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , where these ratios are at the scale @xmath87 .",

    "for example , in typical messenger sector models , @xmath2 is likely to be larger than @xmath98 if there is no fine - tuning ; otherwise , the susy breaking scale in the mssm sector is so low that slepton masses become lighter than the experimental limit  @xcite .",
    "there are also many other recently proposed models , including those based on direct gauge mediation , that give high susy breaking scales@xcite",
    ". can be as small as @xmath99 to @xmath100 gev , and the nlsp may decay inside the detector . ] in a wide variety of models , therefore , the stau decays outside the detector , and we will concentrate on this possibility for the rest of this study .",
    "long - lived staus are charged , weakly interacting , penetrating particles , and so appear in the tracking and muon chambers of collider detectors with little associated energy deposition in calorimeters .",
    "they therefore look like muons .",
    "however , since long - lived staus must have mass above 75 gev  @xcite , their velocity is typically not large if produced at the tevatron .",
    "moderately relativistic charged particles lose energy in matter primarily through ionization .",
    "the rate of energy loss @xmath101 is determined largely by the particle s velocity @xmath95 , grows rapidly with decreasing @xmath95 for low @xmath95  @xcite , and may be measured in tracking chambers . as a result",
    ", the cross section of slow staus may be significant , and highly ionizing tracks may be a spectacular signal of such particles .",
    "if the stau is the nlsp , all superparticles eventually decay to staus , and so all superpartner production processes may result in highly ionizing tracks .",
    "however , in typical gauge - mediated scenarios , superparticle production at the tevatron is dominated by only a few processes .",
    "first , squarks , higgsinos , and heavy higgs bosons ( which may decay to superparticles ) are too heavy to be produced in significant numbers .",
    "second , left - handed sleptons , though typically much lighter than these particles , are still significantly heavier than right - handed sleptons , and so , in terms of overall rate , the drell - yan production of left - handed sleptons is negligible relative to that for right - handed sleptons .",
    "the dominant processes are therefore right - handed slepton production and gaugino production . in the following subsections , we discuss these two processes and their potential for susy discovery in turn .      at the tevatron ,",
    "direct right - handed slepton production takes place through the drell - yan processes    @xmath102    cross sections for a single generation of right - handed slepton production as a function of slepton mass are given in fig .",

    ", decays @xmath106 are also possible  @xcite , but we will not consider this scenario here .",

    "unfortunately , the requirement that the decay be sufficiently far from the interaction point typically requires @xmath107@xmath6 mass splittings so small that the leptonic decay products are too soft and the kinks are too small to be detected .",

    "highly ionizing tracks may be faked by a real muon that overlaps with another particle track , which enhances the measured @xmath101 .",
    "the role of the muon may also be played by a hadron that punches through to the muon chambers .",
    "however , such backgrounds typically arise when the muon or hadron is part of a jet , and so are drastically reduced by requiring the highly ionizing particle to be isolated from significant hadronic activity .",
    "cdf has reported  @xcite such a search for highly ionizing tracks .",
    "they require the slow particle track to have @xmath108 so that it is detected in the highly shielded central muon upgrade detector .",

    "given only the current run i data , they are therefore weaker than the current lep bound of @xmath12 , independent of model assumptions . for signal ( b ) , the reaches plotted are conservative , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugino ] . finally , signal ( e ) , multi - lepton events from wino production , requires that the leptons from @xmath208 and @xmath209 transitions be energetic enough to be detected . for @xmath184 and 4 ,",
    "this is always true for the former decay in the stau nlsp region .",
    "however , the latter decay may result in soft leptons , and the bound from signal ( e ) is therefore weakened for points very close to the boundary of the shaded region .",
    "we have not included this effect in the figures .    for the particular parameters we have chosen ,",
    "a number of interesting conclusions may be drawn .",
    "given the current run i data , the slepton production signals ( a ) and ( c ) are superseded by the requirement that the parameters yield the stau nlsp scenario in the first place .",
    "thus , for low @xmath50 , only the gaugino production signals ( b ) and ( e ) provide non - trivial probes of the parameter space .",
    "however , even given only the current tevatron data sample , signals ( b ) and ( e ) do probe regions of parameter space not excluded by the current lep bound @xmath12  @xcite . for @xmath184 , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : gm3_run1 ] that signal ( b ) is sensitive to parameter regions beyond this bound , and signal ( e ) probes regions with @xmath210 , which are even beyond the ultimate kinematic reach of lep ii .",
    "for @xmath198 , the ratio @xmath211 is reduced , and the strength of gaugino production mechanisms relative to slepton mechanisms is slightly weakened . however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm4_run1 ] , signal ( b ) is still competitive with the current lep bound , and signal ( e ) will significantly extend the reach of lep ii for certain values of @xmath32 .    in the context of the stau nlsp scenario ,",
    "if no signals are found in analyses of the available tevatron data , current bounds on wino masses will be extended to roughly 200 gev .",
    "in addition , in the framework of the particular model we have described , an indirect bound on @xmath72 may be set .",
    "for example , for @xmath184 , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : gm3_run1 ] that stau masses below @xmath212 would be excluded by the absence of signal ( e ) .",

    "[ fig : gm3_tot ] and [ fig : gm4_tot ] , we present results for the same model parameters , but for future tevatron runs with @xmath213 and @xmath214 , 10 , and @xmath0 .",
    "again , as we have assumed @xmath88 , discovery reaches from ( d ) multi - lepton signatures of slepton pair production are inapplicable .",
    "signal ( c ) is again weak relative to the others . for integrated luminosities of @xmath215 or more , direct probes of slepton masses from signal ( a ) and",
    "indirect probes from signals ( b ) and ( e ) all exceed @xmath216 , and susy discovery in these modes is possible , even given potential lep ii bounds on the stau mass . for @xmath217 , the multi - lepton gaugino production signal ( e )",
    "is dominant , and indirectly excludes stau masses below @xmath218 .",
    "however , for increasing luminosity , the relative importance of the slow slepton signal ( a ) increases . for @xmath219 and @xmath220 ,",
    "signal ( a ) becomes the most sensitive probe , with sensitivity to regions of parameter space with wino masses in excess of 400 to 600 gev .",
    "gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models provide an elegant solution to one of the most puzzling issues in supersymmetry , namely , the supersymmetric flavor problem .",
    "the phenomenology of these models is to a large extent dominated by the character of the nlsp . in the most popular gauge mediation scenarios , there are four options , as the nlsp may be either the neutralino or stau , and may be either stable or unstable in detectors .",
    "three of these scenarios have received fairly extensive attention in the past . in this study , we have given for the first time a detailed treatment of prospects for susy discovery at the tevatron in the fourth scenario , in which the nlsp is a long - lived stau . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , this scenario is realized in a wide range of parameter space in models with messenger sectors with @xmath221 .    in such scenarios , all superparticles",
    "decay ultimately to the lighter stau @xmath6 , which appears in collider detectors as a ( possibly slow ) muon .",
    "we have analyzed the prospects for discovering susy by detecting highly ionizing tracks from slow @xmath6 production , an apparent excess in dimuon events from stau pairs , and the appearance of spectacular multi - lepton events from superpartner pair production followed by decays .",
    "of the signals considered , the dimuon excess is least promising , as it suffers from the large background of genuine @xmath222 production .",
    "its use appears to be limited to confirming the supersymmetric interpretation of other , more sensitive signals .",
    "note , however , that a dimuon excess is only the simplest example of an apparent violation of lepton universality from long - lived @xmath6 production .",
    "many other possibilities exist .",
    "if a statistically significant excess of @xmath48 over @xmath167 events appears in any event sample , we strongly encourage the investigation of the long - lived charged slepton hypothesis , either by looking for highly ionizing slow tracks in this event sample , or by forming distributions of kinematic variables under the assumption that the muons are in fact sleptons of some given mass .",
    "the remaining signals are sufficiently spectacular that they are essentially background - free after the cuts we have detailed in secs .",
    "[ sec : ionization ] and [ sec : multi - lepton ] . we have analyzed various data samples , beginning with run i data with @xmath144 and integrated luminosity @xmath206 . with this current data , we find that the sensitivity from slepton production is not competitive with the current bound on long - lived staus of @xmath223 from combined lep analyses .",
    "however , winos with masses beyond the lep kinematic limit may be produced in significant numbers at the tevatron .",
    "wino pair production therefore probes regions of parameter space beyond the current lep bound , and even beyond the possible ultimate kinematic reach of lep ii .",
    "the analysis of currently available tevatron data therefore provides interesting new probes of the gauge mediation parameter space .",
    "given the great interest in future tevatron upgrades , we then considered what improvements may be expected from future tevatron data .",
    "as the backgrounds to the signals we consider are extremely suppressed , we find that significant improvements may be expected . for future",
    "tevatron runs with integrated luminosities of 2 , 10 , and @xmath0 , we estimate that susy may be discovered for right - handed slepton masses of 110 , 180 , and 230 gev and wino masses of 310 , 370 , and 420 gev , respectively .",
    "these new and spectacular signals are therefore sensitive to much of the typically expected superpartner mass range and provide a promising avenue for susy searches at tevatron runs in the near future .",

    "<S> in supersymmetric models with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking , charged sleptons are the next lightest supersymmetric particles and decay outside the detector for large regions of parameter space . in such scenarios , supersymmetry may be discovered by searches for a number of novel signals , including highly ionizing tracks from long - lived slow charged particles and excesses of multi - lepton signals . </S>",
    "<S> we consider this scenario in detail and find that the currently available tevatron data probes regions of parameter space beyond the kinematic reach of lep ii . </S>",
    "<S> future tevatron runs with integrated luminosities of 2 , 10 , and @xmath0 probe right - handed slepton masses of 110 , 180 , and 230 gev and wino masses of 310 , 370 , and 420 gev , respectively , greatly extending current search limits . </S>"
