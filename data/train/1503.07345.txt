    "ordinal analysis is a method of time series analysis that consists of computing the probabilities of _ ordinal patterns _ , which are defined according to the ordering of @xmath0 consecutive values in the series @xcite .",
    "the entropy of these probabilities , referred to as _ permutation entropy _",
    ", is a tool to detect possible regularities in the time series . in recent years",
    ", ordinal patterns and permutation entropy have been widely used to investigate complex dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "they have been employed in the attempt to distinguish noise from chaos @xcite , to detect noise - induced order @xcite , serial correlations @xcite and dependencies between two or more time series @xcite , among many other examples .",
    "applications to experimental time series analysis include classification and discrimination of dynamical states in normal and epileptic eeg @xcite and detection of heart rate variability under different physiological and pathological conditions @xcite .",
    "given this growing interest , it is relevant to understand the relation between the permutation entropy and other complexity measures . in particular , a well - established way to characterize",
    "the production of information of a dynamical system is the kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xmath1 , see e.g. @xcite . to compute @xmath1",
    ", the time series is discretized by partitioning the phase space into regions and assigning a symbol to each region .",
    "then one computes the probabilities of _ blocks _ , which are vectors of @xmath0 consecutive symbols ( more details in the following sections ) .",
    "the entropy of the block probabilities is the _ block entropy_. the kolmogorov - sinai entropy is finally obtained as the rate of growth , for @xmath2 and in the limit of a very refined partition , of the block entropy .    similarly to @xmath1 , one can introduce a _ permutation entropy rate _ as the rate of growth for @xmath2 of the permutation entropy .",
    "both the permutation entropy and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy measure the `` asymptotic '' information rate of representations of the time series , the former with ordinal patterns ( based in the relative order of consecutive values ) and the latter with blocks ( based on a partition of the phase space ) .",
    "the permutation entropy rate and @xmath1 are not only conceptually related : for piecewise monotone interval maps on the real line , they were shown to be equal @xcite .",
    "this result has been later extended to a broad class of dynamics @xcite .",
    "this equivalence is non - trivial considering , for example , that the number of total possible ordinal patterns grows with @xmath0 as @xmath3 , while the number of blocks grows as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total number of symbols .",
    "the two quantities can be equal only thanks to the large number of forbidden ordinal patterns , strongly limiting the growth of the permutation entropy as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "these mathematical results clarify that , under general hypotheses , permutation and block entropies share the same asymptotic behavior .",
    "however , due to difficulties in reaching the asymptotic regime , this equivalence can be of little use in many practical cases .",
    "for example , it has been noted @xcite that the rate of convergence of the permutation entropy to the kolmogorov - sinai entropy is extremely slow even for one - dimensional maps , while on the contrary , block entropies converge very quickly , see e.g. @xcite .    comparing the two analyses becomes even more problematic for high - dimensional and/or noisy dynamics , such as typical experimental time - series .",
    "consider for example the extreme case of a time series dominated by noise , in which all symbols are equally probable and temporal correlations are absent . in this case , the block entropy of length @xmath0 is equal to @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is the total number of symbols , while the permutation entropy with patterns of length @xmath0 is equal to @xmath7 .",
    "this means that the block entropy is linear in @xmath0 , with a slope @xmath8 , explicitly dependent on the chosen partition , which diverges only in the limit of a very refined partition , @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , the permutation entropy grows more than linearly , so that their asymptotic slope is infinite . in both cases ,",
    "the result is an infinite entropy rate .",
    "however , to discover it , in the first case one needs to construct a very refined partition . in the second case",
    ", one needs to reach large values of @xmath0 to appreciate that the slope increases logarithmically .",
    "both these tasks can be very difficult when analyzing a finite time series due to statistical limitations .",
    "our goal is to get a better understanding of how noise influences the permutation entropy . to this aim",
    ", we analyze simulated and experimental time series .",
    "we mostly focus on permutation entropy as the effect of noise on block entropies is fairly well understood , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we first analyze time series generated from the logistic map and from poincar sections of the three - dimensional rssler system .",
    "we conclude with an experimental example of output intensity data recorded from a semiconductor laser with optical feedback .",
    "we consider two dynamical systems : the one - dimensional logistic map and the three - dimensional rssler system . in both cases , we study the effect of adding to the dynamical equations a gaussian white noise , @xmath10 with @xmath11 and temporal correlation @xmath12 .",
    "we considered also the case of observational noise ( not shown ) , where the dynamics is deterministic but the noise affects the observation , obtaining very similar results .",
    "@xmath13    where @xmath14 is the state of the system at iteration @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the noise strength . in order to constrain the variable @xmath14 in the interval @xmath17 $ ] , the values of @xmath18 that would lead to @xmath19 or @xmath20 are simply discarded and redrawn .",
    "thus , the noise @xmath18 is temporally uncorrelated , but not purely gaussian due to this truncation effect . to investigate the variation of the permutation entropy with the noise strength",
    ", we computed the permutation entropy , for each value of @xmath16 , from time series of length @xmath21 .",
    "we have also studied other nonlinear one - dimensional maps ( tent , bernoulli and quadratic ) and obtained very similar results to those of the logistic map ( results not shown ) .",
    "the rssler equations read @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the states of the system at time @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the noise strength and @xmath24 are the local parameters set at \\{@xmath25 } , respectively .    in order to apply the symbolic methods ( ordinal patterns or blocks ) we need to discretize the dynamics . instead of employing temporal sampling @xcite",
    ", we introduce a poincar section @xcite at @xmath26 , and analyze the time intervals between consecutive crossings of the poincar plane . for each value of @xmath16 ,",
    "the permutation entropy is computed from time - series of @xmath27 data points .",
    "experimental data was recorded from the output intensity of a semiconductor laser with optical feedback operating in the low - frequency fluctuations ( lffs ) regime . in this regime ,",
    "the laser intensity displays sudden and apparently random dropouts , followed by gradual recoveries .",
    "this spiking dynamics has received considerable attention because the intensity dropouts are induced by stochastic effects and deterministic nonlinearities .",
    "the optical feedback introduces a delay which renders the system in principle infinite dimensional .",
    "therefore , the laser in the lff regime generates complex fluctuations that , because of the stochastic and high - dimensional nature of the underlying dynamics , are suitable to be investigated by means of complexity measures such as the permutation and block entropies .",
    "the experimental setup is the same as in @xcite and uses a 650 nm algainp semiconductor laser ( sony sld1137vs ) with optical feedback .",
    "the feedback was given through a mirror placed 70 cm apart from the laser cavity , with a round trip of 4.7 ns .",
    "the feedback was controlled using a neutral density filter that can adjusts the light intensity injected into the laser .",
    "the laser has a solitary threshold current of @xmath28 ma .",
    "the temperature and current of the laser were stabilized using a combi controller thorlabs itc501 with an accuracy of @xmath29 c and @xmath29 ma , respectively .",
    "the current used during the experiment was @xmath30 ma and the temperature was set at @xmath31 c. the neutral density filter was adjusted so that the threshold reduction due to feedback was about 7% .",
    "the signal was captured using a photo detector ( thorlabs det210 ) connected to a femto hsa - y-2 - 40 amplifier and registered with a 1 ghz digital oscilloscope ( agilent infiniium dso9104a ) with @xmath32 ns of sampling .",
    "the intensity time series were acquired from the oscilloscope by a labview program that uses a threshold to detect the times when the intensity drops , and calculates the time intervals between successive threshold crossings ( in the following , referred to as inter - dropout - intervals , idis ) .",
    "we recorded in this way time series of more than @xmath33 consecutive idis .",
    "we compare two different methods to transform a time - series , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , into a sequence of symbols , @xmath36 : ordinal patterns and blocks .    in both cases , one needs to choose a _ dimension _",
    "@xmath0 for defining vectors made up of consecutive entries of the time series , i.e. @xmath37 . ordinal patterns and blocks differ by the way in which the entries of these vectors are transformed into symbols .",
    "ordinal patterns classify them according to the ranking ( from the largest to the smallest value ) of the @xmath0 entries in the vectors .",
    "the total number of ordinal patterns of length @xmath0 is then equal to the number of permutations , @xmath3 .",
    "for example , with @xmath38 there are two ordinal patterns : @xmath39 corresponding to the ordinal pattern ` @xmath40 ' and @xmath41 corresponding to the ordinal pattern ` @xmath42 ' .    for blocks ,",
    "the phase space is first divided into @xmath5 regions , associating a symbol to each region .",
    "blocks represent all vectors in which each value of the time series correspond to the same symbol .",

    "the blocks associated to the time series are @xmath49",
