    "the problem of ferromagnetic ordering in narrow energy bands is up to now extensively discussed . despite the large number of publications on the topic , the magnetism of highly - correlated electronic systems described by the hubbard model  @xcite remains at the center of attention  @xcite .",
    "physically , in this case the picture of magnetism is characterized by the existence of local magnetic moments and differs substantially from the stoner picture of a weak itinerant magnetism  @xcite .",
    "according to nagaoka  @xcite , in the limit of infinite hubbard repulsion the ground state for simple lattices is a saturated ferromagnetic state for a low density @xmath1 of current carriers ( doubles or holes in an almost half - filled band ) .",
    "in particular , nagaoka proved rigorously the existence of saturated ferromagnetic state for a single hole at @xmath2 and found the instability of the spin - wave spectrum in the case with increasing @xmath1 and decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "roth  @xcite applied a variational principle to this problem and obtained two critical concentrations .",
    "the first one , @xmath4 , corresponds to instability of saturated ferromagnetic state , and the second one , @xmath5 , to the transition from non - saturated ferromagnetic into paramagnetic state . for the simple cubic ( sc )",
    "lattice , the values @xmath6 and @xmath7 were obtained .",
    "next , the region of stability of the saturated ferromagnetic was investigated within various approximations in numerous works ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    an interpolational approach to description of magnetic ordering in narrow bands , which yields saturated ferromagnetism for small @xmath1 and non - saturated one for large @xmath1 ,",
    "was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite on the basis of dynamic magnetic susceptibility treatment .",
    "however , the critical concentrations themselves were not determined .",
    "using high - temperature expansions in early papers  @xcite yielded non - stable results concerning stability of ferromagnetsm because of poor accuracy connected with slow convergence  @xcite .",
    "however , according to recent results  @xcite , ferromagnetism also occurs near @xmath8 .",
    "it should be noted that the hole concentration @xmath9 corresponds to the sign change of the chemical potential in the hubbard - i approximation  @xcite in the case of symmetric conduction band , and instability of the paramagnetic state can occur at this point in some simple approximations  @xcite .",
    "experimental data on fe@xmath10co@xmath11s@xmath12  @xcite , a system with strong correlations , give large values of @xmath13 ( saturation ferromagnetism is preserved up to conduction electron concentrations @xmath14 of order @xmath15 ) , but degeneracy effects in the conduction band appear to be important in this system .",
    "the approaches mentioned do not analyze as a rule in detail the structure of the one - particle excitation spectrum in the ferromagnetic phase of the hubbard model .",
    "the simplest `` hubbard - i '' approximation  @xcite for the electron spectrum corresponds to the zeroth order in the inverse nearest - neighbor number @xmath0 ( `` mean - field '' approximation in the electron transfer ) .",
    "this approximation is quite non - satisfactory at describing ferromagnetism ( in particular , ferromagnetic solutions are absent , except for peculiar models of bare density of states ) .",
    "a consistent calculation of the one - particle green s functions in the case of small @xmath1 ( almost half - filled band ) and low temperatures was performed in refs .",
    "the results demonstrated an important role of non - quasiparticle ( incoherent ) states in the density - of - states picture .",
    "expressions for the one - particle green s functions in a more wide region of @xmath1 and @xmath16 were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a physically transparent mechanism of instability of saturated ferromagnetic state was treated in detail in the works by edwards and hertz  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is connected with occurrence of spin - polaron states above the fermi level of the current carriers .    in this paper , the stability of the saturated ferromagnetic state as the current carrier concentration is raised",
    "is studied using the one - particle green s functions of first order in  @xmath0 and corresponding self - consistent approximations .",
    "this approach makes possible to construct a rather simple and physically transparent picture of the density of states in a saturated hubbard ferromagnet . at the same time , the problem of description of non - saturated state is much more difficult , but our approach turns out to be successful too .",
    "we shall use the hamiltonian for the hubbard model in the limit of infinitely strong coulomb repulsion in the many - electron @xmath17-operator representation  @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the band energy , @xmath20 is the fourier transform of the hubbard operators @xmath21 ( @xmath22 denotes holes and @xmath23 denotes singly occupied states ) .",
    "it should be noted that in this problem of infinitely strong coulomb interaction , a number of difficulties arise in connection with the non - fermi excitation statistics .",
    "these difficulties occur both in the diagram technique  @xcite and in the equations - of - motion method  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been found  @xcite that in the expansion with respect to  @xmath0 the analytic properties of the retarded green s functions were violated for the paramagnetic state .",
