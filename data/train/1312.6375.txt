    "in a recent series of papers,@xcite we have shown how the critical behavior of the @xmath0-dimensional random - field ising , and more generally @xmath1 , models can be fully described through the functional renormalization group ( frg ) .",
    "we have in particular stressed that the solution to many puzzles associated with this critical behavior lies in the existence of a transition between a region satisfying the @xmath4 dimensional reduction , _",
    "i.e. _ where the critical behavior of the random - field system is identical to that of the corresponding pure model in two dimensions less,@xcite and one where dimensional reduction is broken .",
    "the above transition takes place at a nontrivial location in the @xmath2 plane , in contrast for instance with the case of an interface in a random environment where dimensional reduction is always wrong below the upper critical dimension.@xcite for the random - field @xmath1 model [ rf@xmath1 m ] , the zero - temperature fixed point associated with dimensional reduction disappears below a line @xmath5 that is close to @xmath6 when @xmath7 and decreases as @xmath8 increases , reaching @xmath9 , the lower critical dimension for ferromagnetism in the presence of a continuous @xmath1 symmetry , when @xmath10.@xcite below this line , the zero - temperature fixed point controlling the critical behavior is characterized by strong enough nonanalyticities in the functional dependence of the cumulants of the renormalized disorder .",
    "the latter take the form of a linear `` cusp '' in the cumulants of the renormalized random field .",
    "physically , this results from the presence of large - scale collective events known as `` avalanches '' ( whose fractal dimension is then equal to the fractal dimension of the total magnetization at criticality)@xcite .",
    "formally , this leads to a failure of the ward - takahashi identities associated with the underlying supersymmetry of the model@xcite and to a breaking of the latter.@xcite    in this paper , we take a closer look at the transition from the regime controlled by the dimensional - reduction fixed point to that controlled by the `` cuspy '' fixed point .",
    "although this takes place in an unphysical region in systems with short - range interactions and disorder correlations ( but could nonetheless be studied in @xmath11 when one allows for long - range interactions and disorder correlations as we have recently pointed out@xcite ) , the issue is important to underpin the whole frg - based description .",
