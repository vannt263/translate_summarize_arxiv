    "imagine you are to design a network , be it a local computer network , an infrastructure or communication network , an artificial neural network , or whatever analogous example you can think of .",
    "suppose also that you have some restrictions to do so .",
    "first of all , the number of nodes and the total amount of links are both fixed and , second , nodes should be connected using the available links in such a way that the resulting network topology is _ optimal _ in some sense . of course ,",
    "the meaning of the word `` optimal '' depends on the task to be performed by the network , or in other words , depends on the nature of the dynamical process to be built on top of it .    along this paper",
    "we study optimization of dynamical processes in networks , as exemplified by the following three cases .",
    "suppose we are constructing an artificial neural network , so at each node we locate a neuron ( i.e. an oscillator ) having some unspecified dynamical properties . in order to enhance the neural net performance we want the oscillators to be easily synchronizable @xcite , i.e. to be able to reach as easily as possible a state in which them all , or at least a large fraction of them , fire ( oscillate ) at unison @xcite , and that state to be as robust as possible .    as a second example",
    ", imagine having a communication or technological network and wanting , for the sake of efficiency , any node to be `` nearby '' any other one . the simplest strategy to do so ,",
    "is by constructing a star - like topology with a central node ( or `` hub '' in the network jargon ) directly connected to all the rest . in this way ,",
    "any node is reachable from any other within two steps at most .",
    "however , in cases of intense traffic flow , this might not be very efficient , especially if the central hub gets overburdened or congestioned . also , the star - like topology is very fragile to sabotage to the central node .",
    "so one could wonder what is the optimal topology avoiding the use of a privileged central hub @xcite .    for a third example , let us consider information packets traveling in a network in such a way that they disperse jumping randomly between contiguous nodes and let us require an optimum flow of information .",
    "for that , we define an ensemble of random walkers diffusing on the net , and impose the averaged first - passage time to be minimized . which is the optimal structure ?",
    "analogously , other random - walk properties as the mixing rate @xcite , the mean transit time or the mean return time @xcite could be minimized .    in all these situations",
    "the problem to be solved is very similar : finding an optimal topology under some constraints .",
    "these and similar problems have been addressed in the literature , especially in the context of computer science and , more recently , in the emerging field of complex networks @xcite .    in this paper , we illustrate that the answer to these problems may have a large degree of universality in the sense that , even if the optimal topologies in each case are not `` exactly '' identical , they may share some common features that we review here . to do so , we translate these problems into the one of optimizing some invariant property of a matrix encoding the network topology . in particular , we can use adjacency , laplacian , and normalized - laplacian matrices depending on the particular problem under scrutiny .",
    "spectral analysis techniques are employed to explore in a systematic way network topologies and to look for optimal solutions in each specific problem . in this context , we introduce and characterize what we call _ entangled networks _ : a family of nets with very homogeneous properties and a extremely intertwined or entangled structure which are optimal or almost optimal from different points of view .    along this work",
    ", we focus mainly on un - weighted , un - directed , networks , not embedded in a geography or physical coordinates , and characterized by identical nodes . changing any of these restrictions may alter the nature of the emerging optimal topologies as will be briefly discussed at the end of the paper .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in * section ii *",
    "we introduce topological matrices and other basic elements of spectral graph theory , as for instance the `` spectral gap '' . in * section iii",
    "* we discuss the topological implications of having a large spectral gap and illustrate the connections of this with topological optimization problems : graphs with large spectral gaps are optimal ( or almost optimal ) for some dynamical processes defined on networks . in *",
    "section iv * we present an explicit construction of optimal solutions , called by graph theorists `` ramanujan '' graphs ; such explicit constructions can not be achieved for any number of nodes and links .",
    "owing to this , in * section v * we discuss how to construct optimal graphs in general ( for any given number of nodes and edges ) by employing a recently introduced computational optimization method , enabling us to construct the so called `` entangled networks '' .",
    "we compare entangled networks with ramanujan graphs in the cases when these last can be explicitly constructed , as well as with `` cage graphs '' , another useful concept in graph theory . in * section vi * we enumerate some network design problems where our results are relevant . in * section vii",
    "* we briefly elaborate on the connection of ramanujan and entangled networks in the limit of large sizes with the bethe lattice . in * section viii",
    "* we discuss how the previous results are affected by analyzing dynamical processes controlled by the normalized laplacian rather than by the laplacian .",
    "finally , in * section ix * a critical discussion of our main results , conclusions , and future perspectives is presented .",
    "for the sake of self - consistency and to fix notation we start by revising some basic concepts in graph theory .    given a network ( or graph ) , it is possible to define the corresponding _ adjacency matrix _ , @xmath0 , whose elements @xmath1 are equal to @xmath2 if a link between nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 exists and @xmath5 otherwise . a related matrix is the _ laplacian _ , @xmath6 , which takes values @xmath7 for pairs of connected vertices and @xmath8 ( the degree of the corresponding node @xmath3 ) in diagonal sites .",
    "obviously , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the diagonal connectivity ( or degree ) matrix .",
    "if the graph is undirected both @xmath0 and @xmath6 are symmetric matrices .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath11 is a trivial eigenvalue of @xmath6 with eigenvector @xmath12 and that the eigenvalues @xmath13 satisfy @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the largest degree in the graph .",
    "the proofs of these and other elementary spectral graph properties can be found , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "finally , a _ normalized laplacian matrix _ , @xmath16 , can be defined ; each row is equal to the analogous row in @xmath6 divided by the degree of the corresponding node .",
    "this is useful to describe dynamical processes in which the total effect of neighbors is equally normalized for all sites , while in the absence of such a normalization factor sites with higher connectivity are more strongly coupled to the others than loosely connected ones . in this case we have @xmath17 for @xmath18 , where the @xmath19 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath20 .",
    "clearly , for _ regular _ graphs , that is , graphs where all nodes have the same degree @xmath21 , the two matrices @xmath6 and @xmath20 differ by a multiple of the identity matrix and the eigenvalues are related by @xmath22 .    following the literature ,",
    "here we consider mainly ( but not only ) the laplacian spectrum , but depending on the dynamical process under consideration this choice will be changed .    in order to give a first taste on the topological significance of spectral properties , let us consider a network perfectly separated into a number of independent subsets or _ communities _ having only intra - subset links but not inter - subset connections . obviously , its laplacian matrix ( either the non normalized or the normalized one ) is block - diagonal .",
    "each sub - graph has its own associated sub - matrix , and therefore @xmath5 is an eigenvalue of any of them . in this way",
    ", the degeneration of the lowest ( trivial ) eigenvalue of @xmath6 ( or of @xmath20 ) coincides with the number of disconnected subgraphs within a given network .",
    "for each of the separated components , the corresponding eigenvector has constant components within each subgraph .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the subgraphs are not perfectly separated , but a small number of inter - subset links exists , then the degeneracy will be broken , and eigenvalues and eigenvectors will be slightly perturbed . in particular",
    "relatively small eigenvalues will appear , and their corresponding eigenvectors will take `` almost constant '' values within each subgraph .",
    "for instance , if the number of subsets is @xmath23 , spectral methods have been profusely used for graph bipartitioning or graph bisecting @xcite as follows .",
    "one looks for the smallest non - trivial eigenvalue ; its corresponding eigenvector should have almost constant components within each of the two subgroups , providing us with a bipartitioning criterion .",
    "therefore a graph with a `` small '' first non - trivial laplacian eigenvalue , @xmath24 , customarily called _ spectral gap _",
    "( or also _ algebraic connectivity _ ) has a relatively clean bisection .",
    "in other words , the smaller the spectral gap the smaller the relative number of edges required to be cut - away to generate a bipartition .",
    "conversely a large `` spectral gap '' characterizes non - structured networks , with poor modular structure , in which a clearcut separation into subgraphs is not inherent .",
    "this is a crucial topological implication of spectral gaps .",
    "a closely related concept is the _",
    "expansion property_. to introduce it , let us consider a generic graph , @xmath25 , and define the _ cheeger or isoperimetric constant _ as follows .",
    "first , one considers all the possible subdivisions of the graph in two disjoint subsets of vertices : @xmath0 and its corresponding complement @xmath26 .",
    "the cheeger constant , @xmath27 , is defined as the minimum value over all possible partitions of the number of edges connecting @xmath0 with @xmath26 divided by the number of sites in the smallest of the two subsets .",
    "the cheeger constant is larger than @xmath5 if and only if the graph is connected , and is `` large '' if any possible subdivision has many links between the two corresponding subsets .",
    "hence , for graphs with poor community structure , the cheeger constant is large .    in the graph - theory literature",
    "the concept of _ expander _ is introduced within this context @xcite : a family of expanders is a family of _ regular graphs _ with degree @xmath21 and @xmath28 nodes , such that for @xmath29 the cheeger constant @xmath30 is always larger than a given positive number @xmath31 .",
    "note that the word `` expansion '' , refers to the fact that the topology of the network - connections is such that any set of vertices connects in a robust way ( `` expands through '' ) all nodes , even if the graph is sparse . obviously , for this to happen , @xmath21 should be larger or equal than @xmath32 , as for @xmath33 all graphs are linear chains and can be , therefore , cut in two subgraphs by removing just one edge ( arbitrarily small cheeger constant for large system sizes ) .",
    "the cheeger constant and the expansion property can be formally related to the spectral gap by the following inequalities @xcite : @xmath34 therefore , _ a family of regular graphs is an expanding family if and only if it has a lower bound for the spectral gap , and the larger the bound the better the expansion_. among the applications of expander graphs are the design of efficient communication networks , construction of error - correcting codes with very efficient encoding and decoding algorithms , de - randomization of random algorithms , and analysis of algorithms in computational group theory @xcite .    as a consequence of this ,",
    "expansion properties are enhanced upon increasing the spectral gap , but spectral gaps can not be as large as wanted , especially for large graph sizes . in the case of @xmath21-regular graphs ( the ones for which expanders have been defined )",
    "there is an asymptotic upper bound for it derived by alon and boppana @xcite , given by the spectral gap of the infinite regular tree of degree @xmath21 ( called bethe tree or bethe lattice ) : @xmath35    whenever a graph has @xmath36 ( i.e. when the spectral gap is larger than its asymptotic upper bound ) , it is called a _ ramanujan graph_. therefore , ramanujan graphs are very good expanders . in one of the following sections we will tackle the problem of explicitly constructing ramanujan graphs by following the recently developed mathematical literature on this subject .",
    "so far we have related the spectral graph to the `` compactness '' of a given graph ; a large gap characterizes networks with poor modular structure , in which it is difficult to isolate sub - sets of sites poorly connected with the rest of the graph or , in other words , large gaps characterize expanders . in the following section we shift our attention from topology to dynamics and discuss some other interesting problems which turn out to be directly related to large spectral gaps .",
    "in this section we review two different dynamical processes defined on the top of networks and discuss how some of their properties depend on the underlying graph topology @xcite .      an aspect of complex networks that has generated a burst of activity in the last few years , because of both its conceptual relevance and its practical implications , is the study of _ synchronizability _ of dynamical processes occurring at the nodes of a given network .",
    "how does synchronizability depend upon network topology ?",
    "which type of topology optimizes the stability of a globally synchronized state@xcite ?    a first partial answer to this question",
    "was given in a seminal work by barahona and pecora @xcite who established the following criterion to determine the stability of fully synchronized states on networks .",
    "consider a general dynamical process @xmath37=",
    "f(x_i ) - { \\sigma}\\sum_j l_{ij } h(x_j ) , \\label{pecora}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 with @xmath39 are dynamical variables , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are an evolution and a coupling function respectively , and @xmath42 is a constant",
    ". a standard linear stability analysis can be performed by i ) expanding around a fully synchronized state @xmath43 with @xmath44 solution of @xmath45 , ii ) diagonalizing @xmath6 to find its @xmath28 eigenvalues , and iii ) writing equations for the normal modes @xmath46 of perturbations @xmath47 y_i , \\label{linear}\\ ] ] all of them with the same form but different effective couplings @xmath48 .",
    "barahona and pecora noticed that the maximum lyapunov exponent for eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) is , in general , negative only within a bounded interval @xmath49 $ ] , and that it is a decreasing ( increasing ) function below ( above ) ( see fig . 1 in @xcite , and see also the related work by wang and chen @xcite in which the case @xmath50 $ ] is studied ) . requiring all effective couplings to lie within such an interval , @xmath51 ,",
    "one concludes that a synchronized state is linearly stable if and only if @xmath52 for the corresponding network .",
    "it is remarkable that the left hand side depends only on the network topology while the right hand side depends exclusively on the dynamics ( through @xmath40 and @xmath53 , and @xmath44 ) .    as a conclusion ,",
    "the interval in which the synchronized state is stable is larger for smaller eigenratios @xmath54 , and therefore one concludes that _ a network has a more robust synchronized state if the ratio @xmath55 is as small as possible _ @xcite .",
    "also , as the range of variability of @xmath56 is limited ( it is related to the maximum connectivity @xcite ) minimizing @xmath57 gives very similar results to maximizing the denominator @xmath58 in most cases .",
    "indeed , as argued in @xcite in cases where the maximum lyapunov exponent is negative in an un - bounded from above interval , the best synchronizability is obtained by maximizing the spectral gap .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that for normalized dynamics , i.e. , problems where a quotient @xmath8 appears in the coupling function in eq.([pecora ] ) , the laplacian eigenvalues have to be replaced by the normalized - laplacian ones , so the gap refers to @xmath59 and @xmath57 becomes @xmath60 .",
    "summing up , _ large spectral gaps favor stability of synchronized states ( synchronizability)_.      one of the first and most studied models on graphs are random walks : these are important both as a simple models of dispersion phenomena and as a tool for exploring graph properties .    indeed random walk properties are strictly related to the underlying network structure and , in particular , to the eigenvalue spectrum of the previously introduced matrices . at each step the transition probability from vertex @xmath3 to vertex @xmath4 is trivially given by @xmath61 .",
    "this defines a transition matrix @xmath62 for random walk dynamics , that can be written as @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 the identity matrix ) ; therefore the eigenvectors of @xmath62 and @xmath20 coincide and the eigenvalues are linearly related .",
    "in particular , the stationary probability distribution of the random walk on a graph is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue ( 1 ) of @xmath62 , corresponding to @xmath65 .",
    "then it is easy to see that the convergence rate of a given initial probability distribution towards its stationary distribution ( also called `` mixing rate '' ) is controlled by the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath62 , and therefore by the spectral gap of the normalized laplacian matrix : the larger @xmath59 the faster the decay @xcite .",
    "another relevant property is the first passage time , @xmath66 between two sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 , defined as the average time it takes for a random walker to arrive for the first time to @xmath4 starting from @xmath3 .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors ( @xmath67 ) and eigenvalues of the normalized laplacian matrix as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of link of the network ( see @xcite ) . for @xmath70regular graphs the expression of its graph average , @xmath71 ,",
    "can be simplified in the following way : @xmath72 a large @xmath24 ( which imply that also the following eigenvalues can not be small ) gives an important contribution for keeping @xmath71 small .",
    "therefore large spectral gaps are associated with short first - passage times .",
    "finally , random walks move around quickly on graphs with large spectral gap in the sense that they are very unlikely to stay long within a given subset of vertices , @xmath0 , unless its complementary subgraph is very small @xcite .",
    "this idea has been exploited by pons and latapy @xcite to detect communities structures in networks by associating them to regions where random walks remain trapped for some time . in conclusion : random walks escape quickly from any subset @xmath0 if the spectral gap is large .",
    "summing up : _ random walks move and disseminate fluently in large spectral gap graphs_. related results , more details , and proofs of these theorems can be found , for example in @xcite .",
    "the summary of the preceeding section is that if we are aimed at designing network topologies with good synchronizability or random - walk flow properties , we need criteria to construct graphs with large spectral gaps . on the other hand ,",
    "as explained before , ramanujan graphs are optimal expanders , in the sense that a given family of them , with growing @xmath28 , will converge asymptotically from above to the maximum possible value of the spectral gap .",
    "even if this does not imply that for finite arbitrary values of @xmath28 they are optimal , i.e. that they have the _ largest _ possible spectral gap , they provide a very useful approach for the optimization of the spectral gap problem .",
    "therefore , a good way to design optimal networks so is to explicitly construct ramanujan graphs by following the mathematical literature on this respect @xcite .    in this section",
    "we present a recipe for constructing explicitly families of ramanujan graphs while , in the following one , we will construct large - spectral gap networks by employing a computational optimization procedure .",
    "readers not interested in the mathematical constructions can safely skip this section .      in recent years some explicit methods for the construction of ramanujan graphs have appear in the mathematical literature @xcite .",
    "we describe here only one of them . while the proof that these graphs , constructed by lubotzky , phillips and sarnak @xcite ( and independently by margulis @xcite ) are ramanujan graphs is a highly non - trivial one , their construction , following the recipe we describe in what follows , is relatively simple and can be implemented without too much effort .",
    "let us consider a given group @xmath53 and let @xmath73 be a subset of group elements not including the identity .",
    "the _ cayley graph _ associated with @xmath53 and @xmath74 is defined as the directed graph having one vertex for each group element and directed edges connecting them whenever one goes from one group element ( vertex ) to the other by applying a group transformation in @xmath74 .",
    "the absence of the identity in @xmath74 guarantees that self - loops are absent .",
    "the cayley graph depends on the choice of the generating set @xmath74 and it is connected if and only if @xmath74 generates @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , this will be the only case we consider here .",
    "note that if for each element @xmath75 its inverse @xmath76 also belongs to @xmath74 , then the associated cayley graph becomes undirected , which is the case in all what follows .",
    "in the construction we discuss here , the group @xmath53 is given by either by @xmath77 or by @xmath78 .",
    "consider the group of @xmath79 matrices with elements in @xmath80 ( i.e. integer numbers modulo @xmath81 , where @xmath81 is an odd prime number ) ; the elements of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) are the equivalence classes of matrices with non - vanishing determinant ( determinant equal to one ) with respect to multiplications by multiples of the identity matrix ( i.e. to matrices differing in multiples of the identity are considered to be equal ) .",
    "to specify the subset @xmath74 of cayley graph generators , the integral quaternions @xmath82 must be introduced .",
    "quaternions can be casted in a matrix - like form as @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 are odd prime integers , satisfying @xmath85 .",
    "writing quaternions in this way , it turns out that their algebra coincides with the standard algebra of matrices and the quaternion norm @xmath86 is equal to the corresponding matrix determinant .",
    "now another odd prime number @xmath87 has to be chosen .",
    "it can be shown that there are @xmath88 elements in @xmath89 satisfying @xmath90 . if @xmath91 then by taking @xmath92 odd and positive the number of solutions is reduced to @xmath93 , while if @xmath94 then the number of solutions is reduced to @xmath93 by taking @xmath92 even and requiring the first non - zero component to be positive .",
    "if @xmath87 is a perfect square modulo @xmath81 such solutions can be mapped to a set @xmath74 of @xmath93 matrices belonging @xmath78 ( to guarantee that all such matrices are distinct , one can take @xmath95 ) .",
    "a ramanujan graph is then built as the cayley graph with @xmath96 using the set @xmath74 of generators we just constructed ; the number of nodes is given by @xmath97 ( the number of elements of @xmath78 ) and the degree of each node is @xmath98 ( the elements of @xmath74 ) .",
    "if , otherwise , @xmath87 is not a perfect square modulo @xmath81 we map the solutions to a set @xmath74 of @xmath77 matrices and a ramanujan graph is build as the cayley graph with @xmath99 and the set @xmath74 just constructed . in this case @xmath100 and @xmath98 .    putting all this together , ramanujan graphs can be built by the following procedure @xcite :    * choose values of the odd prime numbers @xmath81 and @xmath87 , with @xmath95 ; * associate the matrices of @xmath77 or @xmath78 ( depending on the relative values of @xmath87 and @xmath81 ) with graph nodes ; * find the solutions of @xmath101 , a solution of @xmath102 and construct the matrices according to ( [ matrix ] ) ; * find the neighbors of each node by multiplying the corresponding matrix by the just constructed @xmath93 matrices , and represent them by edges .",
    "in this way we construct regular graphs with a large spectral gap , with some restrictions on the number of nodes @xmath28 and the degree @xmath21 : the degree can only be an odd prime number plus one , while the number of nodes grows as the third power of @xmath81 .",
    "first of all , every cayley graph is by construction a regular graph , and so are the ramanujan graphs built following the above procedure .",
    "moreover , lubotzky , phillips and sarnak @xcite proved that these graphs have a large girth ( the _ girth _ , @xmath103 , of a graph is the length of the shortest loop or cycle , if any ) , providing a lower bound for the @xmath103 which grows logarithmically with @xmath81 ( its exact form is different in the @xmath104 and @xmath105 cases ) . to gain some more intuition about the properties of this family of graph , we plot in the left of figure ( [ rama ] ) the smallest one , corresponding to @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) and @xmath108 nodes ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "some remarks on its topological properties are in order .",
    "the average distance @xmath110 is relatively small ( i.e. one reaches any of the @xmath108 nodes starting from any arbitrary origin in less than four steps , on average ) .",
    "the betweenness centrality @xcite @xmath111 is also relatively small , and takes the same value for all nodes .",
    "the clustering coefficient vanishes , reflecting the absence or short loops ( triangles ) , and the minimum loop size is large , equal to @xmath112 , and identical for all the nodes . in a nutshell : _ the network homogeneity is remarkable ; all nodes look alike , forming rather intricate , decentralized structure , with delta - peak distributed topological properties . _",
    "p. chiu , extended the previous method to consider also graphs with degree @xmath32 ( i.e. @xmath114 ; note that the previous construction was restricted to odd prime values of @xmath87 ) . to do this ,",
    "one just needs to consider the following @xmath32 generators @xcite : @xmath115 acting on the elements of @xmath77 or @xmath77 as before .    in the right part of figure ( [ rama ] ) we show the smallest ramanujan graph with degree @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) and @xmath116 nodes ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "this is slightly less homogeneous than the one with @xmath106 , but it is as homogeneous as possible given the previous values of @xmath28 and @xmath21 .",
    "the average distance is also small in this case , @xmath118 , the betweenness is @xmath119 for all nodes , the clustering vanishes , and the size of the minimum loop is @xmath120 . while for edges , the edge betweenness @xcite is @xmath121 for @xmath122 edges while it is @xmath123 , for the remaining @xmath116 edges ; indicating that the net is not fully homogeneous in this case , but not far from homogeneous either .",
    "summing up , the main topological features of these ramanujan graphs is that they are very homogeneous : properties as the average distance , betweenness , minimum loop size , etc are very narrowly distributed ( they are delta peeks in many cases ) .",
    "also , compared to generic random regular graphs , their averaged distance is smaller and the average minimum loop size is larger .",
    "a main limitation of ramanujan graphs constructed in this way is that , for a fixed connectivity , the possible network sizes are restricted to specific , fast growing values .",
    "an alternative route to build up optimal networks with an arbitrary number of nodes and an as - large - as - possible spectral gap or ( almost equivalently ) an as - small - as - possible synchronizability ratio @xmath124 is by employing a computational optimization process .",
    "note , that enumerating all possible graphs with fixed @xmath28 and @xmath125 , and looking explicitly for the minimum value of @xmath57 or largest gap , is a non - polynomial problem and , hence , approximate optimization approaches are mandatory @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we focus on optimizing the laplacian spectral gap while in section viii we will tackle the normalized laplacian case and discuss the differences between the two of them .",
    "the idea is to implement a modified _ simulated annealing _",
    "algorithm @xcite which , starting from a random network with the desired number of nodes @xmath28 and average connectivity - degree @xmath126 , and by performing successive rewirings , leads progressively to networks with larger and larger spectral gaps or smaller and smaller eigenratios @xmath57 . as the spectral gap will be very large in the emerging networks",
    ", they will be typically ramanujan graphs ( whenever they are regular ) .",
    "the computational algorithm is as follows @xcite . at each step",
    "a number of rewiring trials is randomly extracted from an exponential distribution .",
    "each of them consists in removing a randomly selected link , and introducing a new one joining two random nodes ( self - loops are not allowed ) .",
    "attempted rewirings are ( i ) rejected if the updated network is disconnected , and otherwise ( ii ) accepted if @xmath127 , or ( iii ) accepted with probability @xcite @xmath128^{1/(1-q)}\\right)$ ] ( where @xmath129 is a temperature - like parameter ) if @xmath130 .",
    "note that , in the limit @xmath131 we recover the usual metropolis algorithm .",
    "instead we choose @xmath132 which we have verified to give the fastest convergence , although the output does not essentially depend on this choice @xcite .",
    "the first @xmath28 rewirings are performed at @xmath133 .",
    "they are used to calculate a new @xmath129 such that the largest @xmath134 among the first @xmath28 ones would be accepted with some large probability : @xmath135 .",
    "then @xmath129 is kept fixed for @xmath136 rewiring trials or @xmath137 accepted ones , whichever occurs first .",
    "afterwards , @xmath129 is decreased by @xmath138 and the process iterated until there is no change during @xmath139 successive temperature steps , assuming that a ( relative ) minimum of @xmath57 has been found .",
    "it is noteworthy that most of these details can be changed without affecting significatively the final results , while two algorithm drawbacks are that the calculation of eigenvalues is slow and that the dynamic can get trapped into `` metastable states '' ( corresponding to local but not global extreme values ) as we illustrate in @xcite .",
    "running the algorithm for different initial networks , we find that whenever @xmath28 is small enough ( say @xmath140 ) , the output - topology is unique in most of the runs , while some dispersion in the outputs is generated for larger @xmath28 ( @xmath141 is the larger size we have optimized ) .",
    "this is an evidence that the @xmath57 absolute minimum is not always found for large graphs , and that the evolving network can remain trapped in metastable states . in any event , the final values of @xmath57 are very similar from run to run , starting with different initial conditions , as shown in fig",
    ".  [ evolution ] , which makes us confident that a reasonably good and robust approximation to the optimal topology is typically obtained , though , strictly speaking , we can not guarantee that the optimal solution has been actually found , especially for large values of @xmath28 .      in figures",
    "( [ cages ] ) and ( [ entangled ] ) we illustrate the appearance of the networks emerging out of the optimization procedure , that we call _ entangled networks _ , for different values of @xmath28 and @xmath125 .",
    "remarkably , for some small values of @xmath28 and @xmath21 ( see figure ( [ cages ] ) ) , it is possible to identify the resulting optimized networks with well - known ones in graph theory : _ cage graphs _ @xcite .",
    "a @xmath142-cage graph is a @xmath21-regular graph with girth @xmath103 having the minimum possible number of nodes .",
    "cage graphs have a vast number of applications in computer science and theoretical graph analysis @xcite . for @xmath113 and @xmath143 , and @xmath116 , respectively , the optimal nets found by the algorithm are cage - graphs with girth @xmath139 , @xmath112 , and @xmath144 respectively ( called @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 graphs in the mathematical literature ; see fig.([cages ] ) and also the nice picture gallery and mathematical details in @xcite ) .",
    "we also recover other cage graphs for small values of @xmath28 for @xmath106 and @xmath148 .    for some other small values of @xmath28",
    ", cage graphs do not exist .",
    "for example , for @xmath113 and girths , @xmath149 , and @xmath144 the cage graphs have the sizes : @xmath150 , and @xmath116 respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , for sizes as @xmath151 or @xmath152 there is no cage with @xmath113 . in these cases ,",
    "our optimization procedure leads to graphs similar to cages ( see figure [ nocages ] ) in which the shortest loops are as large as possible , and all of them have very similar lengths . in this sense ,",
    "our family of optimal graphs provides us with topologies `` interpolating '' between well known cage graphs .    in the emerging entangled networks short loops",
    "are severely suppressed as said before .",
    "this can be quantified by either the _ girth _ or more accurately by the average length , @xmath153 , of the shortest loop from each node .",
    "in particular , the clustering coefficient ( measuring the number of triangular loops in the net ) vanishes , as loops have typically more than three edges .    to have a more precise characterization of the emerging topologies , especially for larger graphs ( see figure ( [ entangled ] ) ) , we monitored different topological properties during the optimization process , as shown in figure ( [ evolution ] ) .",
    "the node - degree standard deviation typically decreases as @xmath57 decreases meaning that the optimal topology approaches a regular one .",
    "the betweenness standard deviation also decreases with @xmath57 implying that optimal networks tend to be as homogeneous as possible , and that all nodes play essentially the same role in flow properties .",
    "also , the average node distance and average betweenness are progressively diminished on average : nodes are progressively closer to each other and the network becomes less centralized as the optimization procedure runs .",
    "it has also been numerically verified that the average first passage times of random walk is reduced during the network optimization .",
    "the fact that the betweenness distribution is very narrow , indicates that ( following an original idea by girvan and newman @xcite ) it is very difficult to divide the network into communities .",
    "indeed , in the algorithm proposed in @xcite to identify communities , links with high betweenness centrality are progressively cut out ; if all links have the same centrality the method becomes useless and communities are hardly distinguishable .",
    "we have named the emerging structures _ entangled networks _ , to account for their very intricate and interwoven topology , with extremely high homogeneity in different topological properties , poor modularity or community structure , and large loops . in particular , as the spectral gap is very large and they tend to be regular , entangled nets are usually ramanujan graphs .",
    "we have also exploited our understanding of the entangled - topology to generate optimal networks more efficiently . in particular , given the convergence in all the explored cases to almost regular networks , we have constructed an improved version of the algorithm in which we start with random regular nets and rewire edges in such a way that the original degree distribution is preserved ( indeed , most of the entangled networks depicted in this section are obtained using this improved algorithm ) . for this , links are selected by pairs , an origin node is selected for each one and the two end nodes are exchanged as shown in figure [ rewiring ] .",
    "we have observed numerically that the convergence towards optimal solutions is faster when constraining the optimization to the regular networks and that for large values of @xmath28 the final outputs have smaller values of @xmath57 than the original ones ( owing to the fact that it is less likely to fall into metastable states ) .",
    "the discussed topological traits remain unaffected .",
    "if we are to design optimal networks with a small number of vertices ( say @xmath154 ) then entangled networks ( and hence , cage - graphs , whenever they exist ) are a better choice than ramanujan nets based on cayley - graphs , as those constructed in the previous section . first , these second do exist only for a few small values of @xmath28 .",
    "second , because even when such ramanujan graphs exist entangled network outperform them , as they have a smaller value of @xmath57 ( larger spectral gap ) which has been optimized on - purpose .      for large values of @xmath28 ( say @xmath155 )",
    "entangled networks are difficult to construct as the optimization algorithm becomes not affordably time - consuming . instead , cayley - graph ramanujan networks , whenever they can be constructed , are a better choice .",
    "they are easy and fast to construct by following the recipe described in a previous section and they provide large spectral gaps , closer and closer to the optimal value ( asymptotic upper bound ) as @xmath28 increases .",
    "in this section we illustrate how entangled networks and ramanujan graphs play a crucial role in different contexts , and emerge as optimal ( or close to optimal ) solutions for a number of network optimization problems .",
    "this is one of the examples illustrated in the introduction , and has been recently tackled by guimer et al .",
    "@xcite . by defining an appropriate _ search cost _ function these authors explore which is the ideal topology to optimize searchability and facilitate communication processes .",
    "they arrive at the conclusion that , while in the absence of traffic congestion a star - like ( centralized ) topology is the optimal one ( as briefly discussed in the introduction ) when the density of information - packets traveling through the net is above a given threshold ( i.e. when there is _ flow congestion _ ) the optimal topology is a highly homogeneous one . in this last",
    ", all nodes have essentially the same degree , the same betweenness , and short loops are absent ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "these networks resemble enormously the entangled and ramanujan nets described above .    for a similar comparison between centralized and de - centralized transport in networks ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "also here , decentralized , highly homogeneous , structures emerge as optimal ones under certain circumstances .      in a recent letter ,",
    "colizza et al .",
    "@xcite have addressed the search of optimal topologies by using different _",
    "selection principles_. in particular they minimize a global cost function defined as @xmath156 with @xmath157 this is , the cost function is the sum over pairs of sites of their relative @xmath158-dependent distance .",
    "the distance between two nodes is the minimum of the sum of @xmath159 ( @xmath160 is the degree of node @xmath87 ) over all possible paths connecting the two nodes . in this way , for @xmath161 the standard distance is recovered . on the other hand , for large values of @xmath158 , highly connected vertices ( hubs ) are strongly penalized . in this way , and rephrasing the authors of @xcite , the generalized definition of the distance `` captures the conflict between two different trends : the avoidance of long paths and the desire to skip heavy traffic '' . for small values of @xmath158 ( standard distance )",
    "the best topology include central hubs ( centralized communication ) , while for @xmath162 the dominant tendency is towards degree minimization , leading to open tree - like structures . for intermediate cases , i. e. @xmath163 topologies extremely similar to entangled networks , with long loops and very high homogeneity ,",
    "have been reported to emerge ( see figure 3c in @xcite ) .",
    "recently kim concluded that neural networks with a clustering coefficient as small as possible exhibit much better performance than others @xcite .",
    "entangled nets have a very low clustering coefficient as only large loops exist and , therefore , they are natural candidates to constitute an excellent topology to achieve good performance and high capacity in artificial neural networks .",
    "the problem of constructing networks whose robustness against random and/or intentional removal is as high as possible has attracted a lot of attention . in particular , in a recent paper @xcite , it has been shown that for generalized random graphs in the limit @xmath164 the most robust topology ( in the sense that the corresponding percolation threshold is as large as possible ) has a degree distribution with no more than @xmath32 distinct node connectivities ; i.e. with a homogeneous degree - distribution as homogeneous as possible .    to study the possible connection with our extremely homogeneous entangled networks , let us recall that the topology we have considered to initialize the improved version of the optimization algorithm ( i.e. random @xmath21-regular graphs ) is already the optimal solution for robustness - optimization against ( combined ) errors and attacks in random networks @xcite .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether further @xmath57-optimization has some effect on the network robustness .",
    "this and related questions have been analyzed in @xcite , where it was shown that indeed , @xmath57 minimization implies a robustness improvement .",
    "this occurs owing to the generation of non - trivial correlations in entangled structures , which place them away from the range of applicability of the result in @xcite ( they are not random networks ) .",
    "hence , entangled networks are also extremely efficient from the robustness point of view .",
    "this conclusion also holds for _ reliability _ against link removal @xcite .",
    "in this section we will show how entangled networks are related to the infinite regular tree called _ bethe lattice _ ( or bethe tree ) in the physics literature .",
    "intuitively , whenever around a given node of a regular graph only large loops are present , the neighborhood of such node looks as the one in a bethe tree , up to a distance equal to the half of the shortest loop length ( see for instance the center of the graph depicted to the right of figure [ nocages ] ) . therefore , if the girth diverges in a family of graphs , the neighborhood of each node tends to look locally like a bethe , up to a growing distance .",
    "we notice that the asymptotic spectral gap of regular graphs is bounded by the one of the bethe tree , @xmath165 ( see equation ( [ inequality2 ] ) ) @xcite .",
    "we can express this bound in terms of the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix ( since the graphs are regular , the results can be easily translated to @xmath6 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the moments @xmath166 of the adjacency matrix eigenvalues @xmath167 can be trivially expressed through the trace of the @xmath168-th power of @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath169 it is easy to see that the diagonal elements of @xmath170 represent the number of paths of length @xmath168 starting and ending at the corresponding node .",
    "clearly , if @xmath168 is smaller than the girth of the graph the paths do not contain loops and their number is equal to the number of such paths for a node of the bethe lattice and therefore equal for all the nodes .",
    "the eigenvalue moments for the infinite bethe lattice can be obtained in a similar way , with the only difference that the eigenvalue distribution is now a continuous spectral density @xcite .",
    "the sum in equation  ( [ eq : moms ] ) is now an integral and the adjacency matrix is a linear operator ; however it is still possible to express the @xmath168-th moments as the number of length-@xmath168 paths from a node to itself . as a result the moments @xmath166 of the adjacency matrix eigenvalues of a regular graph with girth @xmath103 are equal to the moment of the spectral density @xmath171 of the bethe tree @xcite , for every @xmath172 .",
    "the previous argument can be generalized and it can be rigorously proven @xcite that for an infinite sequence @xmath173 of @xmath21-regular graphs , if the number of loops of length @xmath174 grows slower than the number of nodes for every @xmath174 then , the spectral density tends to the one in equation  ( [ eq : specden ] ) .",
    "hence , we expect a fast convergence for graphs with large girth as the ones discussed before .    to illustrate this , in figure [ spden ] we plot the bethe lattice integrated spectral density as a function of the eigenvalues for @xmath106 and compare it with the one calculated for a ramanujan graph with @xmath175 nodes ( @xmath176 ) and also @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the agreement is very remarkable given the finite size of the ramanujan graph .",
    "therefore , both from the ( local ) topological and the spectral point of view , a family of entangled networks ( or ramanujan graphs ) with growing size and girth can be used as the best possible way to approach infinite bethe lattices with a sequence of finite lattices .",
    "this would have applications in a vast number of problems in physics , for which exact solutions in the bethe lattice exist , but comparisons with numerics in sufficiently large lattices are difficult to obtain . in particular , approximations of bethe lattice obtained by truncating the number of generations ( cayley trees ) include a large ( extensive ) amount of boundary effects ( losing the original homogeneity ) and are therefore not a convenient finite approximation .",
    "good approximations should avoid strong boundary effects and preserve the bethe lattice homogeneity , and entangled networks can play such a role .",
    "while most of the literature on synchronization refers to laplacian couplings as specified by equation ( [ pecora ] ) , different coupling functions can be relevant in some contexts .",
    "for example , another natural choice would be @xmath177 = f(x_i ) - { { \\sigma}\\over k_i }    \\sum_j   l_{ij } h(x_j ) , \\label{norma}\\ ] ] relevant in cases where the joint effect of the @xmath8 neighbors of node @xmath3 is normalized by the connectivity @xmath8 . with this type of dynamics",
    ", the effect of neighbors has the same weight for all nodes , while in the absence of the normalization factor , @xmath8 , sites with higher connectivity are more strongly coupled to their neighbors than loosely connected ones .",
    "this describes properly real - world situations , as for instance neural networks , where the influence of the neighboring environment on the node dynamics does not grow with the number of connections .",
    "observe that , even if the underlying topology is unweighted and undirected , the normalization factor is such that _ the dynamics is directed and weighted _ , owing to the presence of @xmath8 in eq.([norma ] ) .    in a recent paper motter and coauthors have undertaken a study of synchronizability by using a generalization of the previous normalized dynamics eq.([norma ] ) , by employing a normalization factor @xmath178 , with @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "these authors conclude that the most robust network synchronizability is obtained for @xmath180 , which leads back to eq.([norma ] ) .    _ what is the influence of the normalization factor on the results reported on this paper ? _",
    "first of all , the optimal synchronizability problem , as discussed in section iii , can be straightforwardly translated for the new dynamics just by replacing eq.([pecora ] ) by eq.([norma ] ) .",
    "the optimal topology for synchronizability in `` normalized '' dynamical processes is that minimizing the eigenratio @xmath181 , ( @xmath19 denote the normalized laplacian eigenvalues ) .",
    "hence , by employing the normalized dynamics , we have a new class of optimization problems , analogous but different to the ones studied before along this paper .",
    "we have implemented different versions of our modified simulated annealing algorithm ( in its more general , not degree - conserving , version ) to optimize either @xmath182 or the normalized spectral gap @xmath59 . after going through the optimization algorithm with normalized - laplacian eigenvalues , as described in section v",
    ", one observes that the emerging optimally synchronizable nets have a _ non - homogeneous structure_. for some relatively small values of @xmath28 and @xmath183 the optimal topologies are shown in figure [ newgraphs ] , while in figure [ newgraphs2 ] we depict an optimal net with @xmath184 nodes .",
    "observe the remarkable difference with previously studied networks : here homogeneity is drastically reduced . to illustrate this , in figure [ degree ] we plot",
    "the degree distribution obtained when optimizing for @xmath185 with @xmath186 and @xmath187 respectively .",
    "the resemblance between these two distributions seems to indicate that a limit degree - distribution exists . roughly speaking it decays faster than exponentially , but still with a much higher degree of heterogeneity than before where we had delta - peaked distributions .",
    "the new emerging topologies exhibit a competition between the existence of central nodes and peripheral ones similarly to the networks studied in @xcite . by maximizing the spectral gap @xmath59 , rather than @xmath188 we obtain very similar results ( not shown here ) .",
    "these new optimal topologies are very similar to those obtained by colizza et al .",
    "@xcite in cases where the minimization of node - degree dominates ( see figure 3d in @xcite ) .",
    "let us remark that for the normalized - laplacian , some eigenvalues bounds , analogous to those for @xmath6 exist ; in particular @xcite @xmath189 however , concepts analogous to `` expanders '' or `` ramanujan '' have not been defined for general , non - regular , graphs .    finally , it is interesting to observe that our results are in apparent contradiction with the conclusion by motter et al .",
    "@xcite that for their case @xmath180 , corresponding to our normalized laplacian , and large _ sufficiently random networks _ the eigenratio @xmath57 does not depend on details of the network topology , but only on its mean degree @xcite .",
    "if this was indeed the case for any network topology , our optimization procedure would be pointless . instead ,",
    "applying the minimization algorithm , starting from any arbitrary finite random network , we observe a progressive @xmath57 optimization , and highly non - trivial non - random optimal structures are actually generated .",
    "this apparent contradiction is likely to be due to the building up of non - trivial correlations during the optimization process , which converts our network into highly non - random structures far away from the _ sufficiently random _ requirement in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have reviewed recent developments in the design of optimal network topologies .",
    "first of all we have related the problem of finding optimal topologies for many dynamical and physical problems , such as optimal synchronizability and random walk flow on networks , to the search of networks with large spectral gaps .",
    "this connection allows us to relate optimal networks to expanders and ramanujan graphs , well - known concepts in graph - theory which , by construction , have large spectral gaps . in one of the sections we have given , following the existing mathematical literature , a recipe to explicitly construct ramanujan graphs .    on the other hand ,",
    "we have employed a simulated annealing algorithm which selects progressively networks with better synchronizability , i.e. networks with larger spectral gaps . when applied to problems with un - normalized laplacian dynamics",
    "this algorithm leads to what we call `` entangled '' topologies .",
    "these are optimal expanders , and can be loosely described as being extremely homogeneous , having long loops , poor modularity , and short node - to - node distances .",
    "they are optimal or almost optimal for many different communication and flow processes defined on regular networks .",
    "in particular these topologies are relevant for the design of efficient communication networks , construction of error - correcting codes with very efficient encoding and decoding algorithms , de - randomization of random algorithms , traffic problems with congestion , and analysis of algorithms in computational group theory .",
    "remarkably , they also provide a good finite - size approximation to bethe lattices .    even though these topologies play an important role in human - designed networks , especially in computer science and algorithmics ,",
    "they do not seem to appear frequently in nature .",
    "indeed , most of the topologies described in recent years for biological , ecological , social , or technological networks exhibit a very heterogeneous scale - free degree distribution @xcite , at odd with the extremely homogeneous entangled topologies . to justify this",
    ", first of all we should emphasize that optimal entangled networks are obtained performing a _",
    "optimization procedure , which might be not very realistic .",
    "for example , by adding a new node to a given optimal network , in some cases the full entangled topology has to be altered to convey with the requirement of maximizing the spectral gap .",
    "this is certainly impractical for growing networks .    on the other hand",
    ", we should also note that there are ingredients that could be ( and actually are ) relevant for the determination of optimal networks in real - world problems and that have not being considered here .",
    "a non exhaustive list of examples is :    * nodes might be non equivalent , * links could support different variable weights , * directed networks might be mandatory in some cases , * in some real - world networks nodes are embedded into a geography and , therefore , the distances between them should be taken into account as a sort of quenched disorder ( see for instance , @xcite for application to communication infrastructures ) .",
    "however , our entangled networks are still relevant for any type of un - directed un - weighted networks in which none of these effects plays an important role , and where communication properties are to be maximized .",
    "numerous examples have being cited above and along the paper .    in the last section of the paper ,",
    "we have `` enlarged our horizon '' by studying a different type of dynamical processes , that could be argued to be more realistic in some circumstances : instead of analyzing laplacian coupling between the network nodes we shifted to the study of normalized - laplacian coupling , which lead to weighted and directed dynamics .",
    "this is characterized by the presence of a `` normalized dynamics '' in which the relative influence of the neighbors on a given site does not depend on the site connectivity . in particular",
    ", this type of dynamics might be more adequate to describe random walks and general diffusion processes on general ( not necessarily regular ) networks . in this case",
    ", an optimization procedure analogous to the one described before , leads to much more heterogeneous optimal topologies , including hubs , and a much broader degree distribution .",
    "this makes the emerging optimal networks closer to real - world topologies than entangled networks , while still keeping the global - optimization perspective .",
    "along this same line of reasoning , other alternative types of dynamics could be introduced , as for instance the `` load - weighted '' ones first proposed in @xcite as a generalization of the normalized - laplacian dynamics . a very interesting , open question , is to define optimization processes along the lines of this paper , leading to scale free topologies .",
    "we hope this work will encourage further research on this fascinating question of optimal network topologies , their evolution , their application to human designed networks and their connection with real - world complex networks .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with d. cassi with whom we are presently exploring the connection with the bethe lattice .",
