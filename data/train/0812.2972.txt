    "according to the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of structure formation , the spatial distribution of galaxies can be understood as a result of gravitational instability of density fluctuations in the cdm , and the dark matter halo mass function can be well described by analytic models @xcite .",
    "more precisely , hierarchical cdm models predict that the massive galaxies at high redshift ( hereafter high-@xmath3 ) are clustered together in high - density regions , while low - mass galaxies tend to be more evenly spaced @xcite . under the assumption that galaxies are produced from primordial density fluctuations owing to gravitational instability , one can estimate the average mass of galaxy host haloes based on clustering data .",
    "for example , @xcite estimated the typical halo mass of lbgs at @xmath4 to be @xmath5 from observations of their auto - correlation function ( acf ) .",
    "damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) , defined as quasar absorption systems with column density of @xmath6 atoms @xmath7 @xcite , probe the hi  gas associated with high-@xmath3  galaxies .",
    "since stars are hardly formed in warm ionized gas and are tightly correlated with cold neutral clouds , the amount of hi  gas is very important , being the precursor of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "dlas dominate the hi  content of the universe at @xmath8 and contain a sufficient amount of hi  gas mass to account for a large fraction of the present - day stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the gas kinematics and chemical abundances of dlas can be measured and are documented in detail . however , the masses of dla host haloes ( hereafter dla haloes ) remain poorly constrained , because only about @xmath9 of quasars exhibit dla absorption per unit redshift @xcite , and the scattered distribution of dlas in quasar sight lines precludes the use of dlas as tracers of dark matter halo mass .",
    "alternatively , the mass of dla haloes can be probed by the cross - correlation between dlas and a galaxy population whose clustering and halo mass are well understood .",
    "@xcite used 211 lbg spectra and 11 dlas to measure the three dimensional ( 3-d ) lbg acf and dla - lbg ccf ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their analysis started by counting the number of lbgs in 3-d cylindrical bins centred on each of 11 dlas , following the method of @xcite .",
    "they detected a statistically significant result of dla - lbg ccf , and estimated an average dla halo mass of @xmath10 , assuming a single galaxy per halo .",
    "on the theoretical side , @xcite calculated the average dla halo mass using a series of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with different box sizes , resolution and feedback strengths .",
    "they found a mean dla halo mass of @xmath11 with their q5 run which is somewhat larger than @xmath12 of @xcite .",
    "more recent work by @xcite showed that the dla cross - section is predominantly provided by intermediate mass haloes , @xmath13 .",
    "these results motivate us to further examine the distribution of dlas relative to that of lbgs . in this paper , we compute the dla - lbg ccf in cosmological sph simulations , using the sample of lbgs and dlas obtained by @xcite .",
    "we compare our results with the observational results by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : simulation ] , we briefly describe the features of our cosmological sph simulations used in this paper . in section  [ sec : ccf ] and section  [ sec : wccf ] , we describe and report the methodology , binning method , and the results for ` unweighted ' and ` weighted ' dla - lbg ccf , respectively .",
    "we then discuss the projected angular ccf for the direct comparison with observational result by @xcite in section  [ sec : angular ] .",
    "the acfs of lbg - lbg and dla - dla are discussed in subsections  [ sec : lbgauto ] and [ sec : dlaauto ] , while the bias results are reported in section  [ sec : bias ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our work in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this paper , we use two different cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations @xcite performed with the gadget-2 code @xcite",
    ". the simulation parameters of the two runs ( named d5 and g5 ) are summarised in table  [ table : para ] .",
    "the same set of runs has been used by @xcite to study the global properties of dlas , such as the dla cross section , incidence rate , and hi  column density distribution functions .",
    "the code we use is characterized by four main features .",
    "first , it uses the entropy - conserving formulation of sph @xcite , which explicitly conserves entropy of the gas where appropriate .",
    "second , highly overdense gas particles are treated with a sub - resolution model for the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "the dense ism is assumed to be made of a two - phase fluid consisting of cold clouds in pressure equilibrium with a hot ambient phase .",
    "cold clouds grow by radiative cooling , and form the reservoir of baryons for star formation .",
    "once star formation occurs , the resulting supernovae ( sne ) deposit energy into the ism , heating the hot gas environment , evaporating cold clouds , and transferring cold gas back into the ambient phase .",
    "this establishes a self - regulation cycle for star formation in the ism , additionally , the simulation keeps track of metal abundance and the dynamical transport of metals .",
    "metals are produced by stars and returned into the gas by sne .",
    "third , a model for galactic winds is included to study the effects of outflows on dlas , galaxies , and intergalactic medium ( igm ) . in this model , gas particles",
    "are driven out of dense star - forming medium by assigning an extra momentum in random directions @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the wind mass - loss rate is proportional to the star formation rate , and the wind takes a fixed fraction of the sn energy .",
    "for the d5 and g5 runs , a strong wind speed of 484kms@xmath14 is adopted ( as opposed to the weak wind speed of 242kms@xmath14 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of the wind models on dla properties was discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "fourth , the code includes radiative cooling and heating with a uniform uv background of a modified @xcite spectrum @xcite , where the reionisation takes place at @xmath15 .",
    "we identify simulated galaxies by grouping the star particles using a simplified variant of the subfind algorithm proposed by @xcite .",
    "this code computes an adaptively smoothed baryonic density field for all star and gas particles , and identifies the centres of individual galaxies as isolated density peaks .",
    "it finds the full extent of these galaxies by processing the gas and star particles in the order of declining density , adding particles one by one to the galaxies .",
    "once the simulated galaxies and consituent particles are identified , we then calculate the luminosity and spectrum of individual star particles using the mass , formation time , and metallicity using the population synthesis code galaxev03 @xcite that assumes the salpeter initial mass function with a mass range of @xmath16\\,{m_{\\odot}}$ ] .",
    "the spectrum of each galaxy is obtained by coadding the spectrum of constituent star particles , and the broad - band colours are computed by convolving with filter functions .",
    "the lbgs are then selected based on the @xmath17 colour selection criteria as described in @xcite",

    "before we present the results of our calculations , let us describe the series of method that we use to measure the correlations of dlas and lbgs .",
    "first , we will examine the simplest case in section  [ sec : ccf ] , where we assume that there is only one dla per halo at the center .",
    "we then discuss the dla cross - section - weighted ccf in section  [ sec : wccf ] to examine the effect of multiple dla clouds in massive haloes .",
    "we compute these two cases using the three dimensional coordinates ( @xmath28 ) of dlas and lbgs .",
    "next , to mimic the observational estimates of two dimensional angular ccf , we compute the angular ccf in section  [ sec : angular ] . finally we compute the auto correlation functions of dlas and lbgs separately in section  [ sec : auto ] , and discuss the biases and halo masses of dlas and lbgs in section  [ sec : bias ] .",
    "the probability of finding an object 1 in volume @xmath29 at a separation @xmath30 from a randomly chosen object 2 can be written as @xmath31\\ , \\delta v_{1}$ ] @xcite .",

    "to estimate @xmath39 , we use the method of @xcite and @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of pairs between the two data samples of dlas and lbgs separated by a distance @xmath42 , and likewise for other terms .",
    "the notation `` @xmath43 '' , for example , represents the dla sample that has random coordinate positions but with an equivalent number density as the original data sample `` @xmath44 '' .",
    "the method of identifying dlas in our simulations is described in detail in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "briefly , we set up a cubic grid that completely covers each dark matter halo , with the grid - cell size equivalent to the gravitational softening length ` @xmath22 ' of each run .",
    "we then calculate the hi  column density @xmath45 of each pixel ( i.e. , a grid - cell on one of the planes ) by projecting the hi  mass distribution , and identify those that exceed the dla threshold of @xmath46 atoms @xmath7 as ` dla - pixels ' .",
    "this method allows us to quantify the dla cross - section ` @xmath47 ' of each halo , and the number of dla - pixel is @xmath48 .",
    "note that we have not made any corrections for the self - shielding of neutral gas in this work .",
    "self - shielding may have significant impact at high hi  column densities , and we are currently investigating this issue with separate simulations @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on the correlation signal at @xmath49 , because this is the scale probed by @xcite . therefore in this paper",
    "we are only concerned about the overall halo positions and not the exact locations of individual dla - pixel within each halo .",
    "the @xmath47-weighted ccf will be discussed in section  [ sec : wccf ] .",
    "first , we select the lbgs that are brighter than @xmath50=25.5 magnitude in the d5 and g5 runs",
    ". there are 30 ( 4030 ) lbgs in the d5 ( g5 ) run . @xcite",
    "have shown that the brightest galaxies with @xmath51 in our simulations satisfy the @xmath17 colour selection criteria for lbgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure 2 of @xcite shows that the d5 run underestimates the number density of lbgs , while the g5 run agrees better with the observation .",
    "there are 22616 ( 25683 ) dla haloes with @xmath52 in the simulated volumes of the d5 ( g5 ) run .",
    "the ` random ' catalogues of lbgs and dla haloes with random positions were created with a random number generator from numerical recipes @xcite .",
    "the selected lbgs were paired with dla haloes , and the number of pairs that reside in spherical shells of [ @xmath53 were counted .",
    "the maximum pair separations probed for the d5 and g5 runs are 10 and @xmath54 , respectively , with 20 bins in a logarithmic scale of distance @xmath30 .",
    "the periodic boundary condition was taken into account appropriately , and the pair - search was extended to the next adjacent box where needed .",
    "we correct all @xmath55 values by the integral constraint ( ic ) .",
    "this correction owes to the finite size of the observed field - of - view , and it must be added to the computed correlation function as follows :    ccccccc & & + run & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + d5 & 2.66 @xmath58 0.23 & 1.50 @xmath58 0.17 & 3.37 @xmath58 0.36 & 1.77 @xmath58 0.21 g5 & 3.03 @xmath58 0.04 & 1.64 @xmath58 0.03 & 3.43 @xmath58 0.06 & 1.66 @xmath58 0.03    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath55 are the corrected and computed ccf ( or acf ) respectively . following the method described in @xcite and @xcite , we calculate the value of ic and find that it changes @xmath55 only slightly in our simulations , with ic @xmath61 for the d5 run .",

    "the best - fitting parameters to the radial ccf by cooke ( private communication ) using spherical shells is @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which is shallower than the angular ccf results . as we will further discuss in section  [ sec : angular ]",
    ", the method of @xcite adopts cylindrical shells at small distances , which have larger volumes than spherical shells .",
    "the cylindrical shell method uses long cylinders at small @xmath71 and captures all the potential lbgs near the dlas , whereas the spherical bins do not .",
    "this effect seems to result in the slightly steeper @xmath57 in @xcite compared to the above spherical shell case ( cooke ; private communication ) .",
    "we regard the comparison to the angular ccf of @xcite as the primary one , because cooke et al .",
    "argue that the angular ccf calculated by the method of @xcite is more robust than the 3-d radial calculation with spherical shells , and the values of ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) derived from both ccfs should be equivalent theoretically ( see section  [ sec : angular ] ) .",
    "in section  [ sec : ccf ] , we calculated the ccf assuming that there is one dla per halo . this assumption is valid as long as we are concerned with the ccf at scales of @xmath72 .",

    "1 ) showed that the dla clouds have extended distributions in massive dark matter haloes .",
    "therefore , it may be more desirable to take the dla cross - section of each halo into account when calculating the ccf , because the chance of finding a dla in the actual observation is already cross - section weighted .",
    "ideally , we would use all the dla pixels and find pairs with the nearby lbgs , but this computation is prohibitively expensive owing to the large number of dla pixels .    a simple way to achieve",
    "this is to weight the number of dla - lbg pairs by the number of dla - pixels of each halo .",
    "since the displacement between dla - pixels within a single halo is typically much smaller than the distance between lbg - dla pairs , we do not count the individual pairs between lbg and dla - pixels . instead",
    ", we treat it as if all dla - pixels are located at the halo centre , and weight each dla - lbg pair - count by the number of dla - pixels @xmath73 ( hereafter we drop the superscript ` dla ' for simplicity ) and compute the @xmath47-weighted ccf as @xmath74 for the ` random ' dla dataset , we shuffle the original @xmath75 list randomly and make new pairs with different dla haloes . again",

    "the number of low - mass haloes is far greater than that of massive haloes .",
    "therefore , even a small weighting by @xmath73 boosts up the overall pair - count , yielding a stronger correlation signal compared to the unweighted case .",
    "the larger lbg sample in the g5 run makes its result more robust against the weighting procedure than that of the d5 run .",

    "in observational studies , a different method is usually used to obtain the values of ( @xmath104 , @xmath57 ) compared with what we described in sections  [ sec : ccf ] and [ sec : wccf ] , because the precise estimation of any lbg position along the line of sight is difficult to achieve owing to redshift uncertainties caused by peculiar velocities and galactic winds . with such imprecision ,",
    "it is not possible to measure the ccf at scales @xmath105 reliably .",

    "[ fig : bias ] , we show the bias of the simulated dlas and lbgs , defined as @xmath143 , as a function of distance @xmath30 , where @xmath144 or @xmath145 . this definition is based on the linear bias model , @xmath146 the corresponding expression for the cross - correlation is @xcite @xmath147 therefore , the two lines for the ccf in figure  [ fig : bias ] are in fact showing @xmath148 , as indicated on the axis on the right - hand - side . taking the ratio of the above two expressions gives @xcite @xmath149    we also show the observed range of bias for the lbgs at @xmath1 by @xcite as a yellow shaded region . in all cases shown in figure  [ fig : bias ] ,",
    "the bias of simulated dlas and lbgs slowly decreases with increasing distance .",
    "the upturn at @xmath150 for the lbg acf is probably just noise .",
    "we take a simple average of bias values across the logarithmic bins at @xmath151 , and find @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 for lbg acf , dla - lbg ccf ( @xmath47-weighted ) , dla - lbg ccf ( unweighted ) , dla acf ( @xmath47-weighted ) , and dla acf ( unweighted ) , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath56 also reflect the sizes of average bias values .",
    "we took the above range of scales for taking the average because most of the recent observations are probing the scale of @xmath157 .",
    "@xcite used the results of @xcite to obtain an average bias of @xmath158 for lbgs at @xmath4 .",
    "our average bias value of 2.60 for the lbg acf is very close to that of @xcite , and at the lower end of the estimate of @xmath159 by @xcite    the model of @xcite shows that an understanding of the unconditional mass function can provide an accurate estimation of the large - scale bias factor . from our average bias",
    ", we calculate the mean halo mass for lbgs and dlas ( using the unweighted and the @xmath47-weighted results ) based on the method described in @xcite , as shown in table  [ table : bias ] .",
    "our calculation of lbg halo mass is very close to that by @xcite , @xmath160 ( yellow shade in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias ] ) , which is very encouraging . finally , @xcite estimated @xmath161 from observations and @xmath162 from simulations .",
    "these values are somewhat higher than the upper limit of our unweighted dla halo mass and close to our @xmath47-weighted one .",
    "@xcite also obtained a similar value of @xmath163 .",
    "alternatively , we can directly calculate the mean dla halo mass using the simulation result without going through the bias argument . for the g5 run ,",
    "the mean is @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "these values are somewhat higher than the mean halo mass reported in table  [ table : bias ] .",
    "however , the values of @xmath166 in table  [ table : bias ] are computed from the average bias within the range of @xmath167 , and they could become higher if we included the bins at smaller scales . since observers probe mostly @xmath168 , the values reported in table  [ table : bias ] are more appropriate for comparison with observations .",
    "@xcite defined the parameter @xmath0 as the ratio of correlation functions : @xmath169 .",
    "if the value of @xmath0 is larger ( or smaller ) than unity , then the mean halo mass of dlas is more ( or less ) massive than that of the lbgs .",
    "the ratio of the average bias of lbg acf and dla - lbg ccf is @xmath170 for our results .",

    "our study represents a first attempt to calculate the dla - lbg cross - correlation function at @xmath1 using cosmological sph simulations .",
    "we calculated the dla - lbg ccfs in several different approaches : 3-d , angular , unweighted , and @xmath47-weighted .",
    "we also computed the auto - cf of lbgs and dlas , and the bias against dark matter . in comparison to the observational data by @xcite",
    ", we find good agreement between our simulations and observational measurements .",
    "our results suggest that the spatial distribution of dlas and lbgs are strongly correlated .",
    "let us summarise some of the main conclusions of this work .",
    "in the first part of this paper , our results on the 3-d ccf calculated with spherical shells ( table  [ table : ccfit ] ) are to be compared with the 3-d spherical shell result by cooke ( private communication ) , @xmath182 and @xmath70 .",
    "our results are consistent with cooke s within the error .",
    "the shallow slope of cooke s above estimate probably owes to the limited sample size in the spherical shell at small distances , as we discussed in sections  [ sec : ccf ] and [ sec : angular ] .    in the second part",
    ", we have replaced the spherical shell method with the projected approach used in @xcite and @xcite , and calculate the best - fitting values given in table  [ table : acf ] .",
    "encouragingly , our results are within the upper and lower limits of the observational measurement by @xcite .",
    "we corrected all cfs in this paper with the integral constraint .    finally , we also analysed the auto - correlation functions of lbgs and dlas at @xmath1 ( table  [ table : acfitdladla ] ) found in our simulations . our results for the best - fitting parameters of the lbg acf agree well with @xcite .",
    "our results show that lbgs are more strongly correlated than dlas , and have higher mean halo mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : param ] summarises the best - fitting power - law parameters for all the correlation functions that we obtained in the earlier sections . in most cases",
    ", the slope @xmath57 falls into the range @xmath183 and the variation is not very large .",
    "the correlation length @xmath56 shows a larger variation from @xmath184 to @xmath185 , depending on the sample and calculation method .",
    "this trend is similar to that seen by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.8 ) . in general",
    ", the @xmath47-weighted method gives a larger @xmath56 than the unweighted method .",
    "finally , the lbg bias , derived from the lbg acf in section  [ sec : bias ] , has led to the upper and lower limits of the lbg dark matter halo mass of @xmath186 ( see table  [ table : bias ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with observational estimates of the lbg halo mass of @xmath187 , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and within the limit of @xmath188 @xcite",
    ". similarly , we derived the dla biases , and obtained the mean dla halo masses as shown in table  [ table : bias ] .",
    "@xcite s measurement showed a dla galaxy bias of @xmath189 and an average dla halo mass of @xmath190 .",
    "our average dla bias ( @xmath191 and @xmath192 for un - weighted dla acf and weighted dla acf , respectively ) and halo mass estimates ( @xmath193=10.71 and 11.02 for un - weighted dla acf and weighted dla acf , respectively ) are in good agreement with theirs .",
    "we also examined the ratio of bias values defined as @xmath194 @xcite , and found that our value of @xmath170 agrees well with the observational estimates .",
    "this again shows that the mean halo mass of dlas is less than that of the lbgs . the fact that @xmath195 is greater than @xmath196 is a natural outcome because the lbg sample is limited to the bright star - forming galaxies with @xmath197 and @xmath198 , whereas the dla hi  gas is present in numerous lower mass haloes below the lbg threshold .    motivated by our earlier successes of our simulations to reproduce the physical properties of lbgs such as stellar mass , sfr , and colours @xcite , in this work we examined another observational method , i.e. dla - lbg ccf , to further check the consistency between observations and simulations .",
    "we found good agreement between our results and observations .",
    "furthermore , there are accumulated evidence that suggest high halo masses for lbgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the scenario that the majority of lbgs is merger - induced starburst systems associated with low - mass haloes @xcite does not appear to be a favored model for lbgs .    in our simulations , we estimated the hi  column densities using a pixel size that is much larger than the typical quasar beam size , which is of the order of parsecs",
    "this may have some impact on our estimates of @xmath45 and the corresponding statistics such as the hi   column density distribution function .",
    "for example , if the ism is clumpy on smaller scales than our pixel size , there could be high - density neutral clouds below our resolution scale that are self - shielded and contain larger amounts of hi .",
    "unfortunately , owing to limitations in computational resources , it is not possible for us at the moment to run such a high - resolution cosmological simulation with the same box size as we have used in this paper . in future work",
    ", we will nevertheless attempt to check the dependence of our @xmath45 estimates on numerical resolution , and perform more rigorous resolution tests .",
