    "the study of jet and prompt - photon inclusive production at high - energy colliders , such as the fermilab tevatron and the cern lhc , is of great interest because it allows us to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and to extract information on the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton .",
    "the presence of a jet or a photon with large transverse momentum , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the asymptotic scale parameter , guarantees that the strong coupling constant remains small in the processes discussed here , i.e.  typically @xmath6 .",
    "the total collision energies , @xmath7  tev and 1.96  tev in tevatron runs  i and ii , respectively , and @xmath8  tev or 14  tev at the lhc , sufficiently exceed the characteristic scale @xmath9 of the relevant hard processes , which is of order of @xmath1 , _",
    "i.e. _  we have @xmath10 . in this high - energy regime , the contribution of partonic subprocesses involving @xmath0-channel parton ( gluon or quark ) exchanges to the production cross section can become dominant",
    ". then the transverse momenta of the incoming partons and their off - shell properties can no longer be neglected , and we deal with  reggeized \" @xmath0-channel partons .",
    "if the particles produced in the collision are strongly separated in rapidity , they obey multi - regge kinematics ( mrk ) .",
    "if the same situation is realized with groups of particles , then quasi - multi - regge kinematics ( qmrk ) is at work . in the case of single jet or prompt - photon inclusive",
    "production , this means the following : a single jet or a prompt photon is produced in the central region of rapidity , while other particles are produced with large modula of rapidities . in the experiment ,",
    "the requirement of separation in rapidity can be controlled by the so - called isolation cone condition .    previously , in ref .",
    "@xcite , single jet inclusive production was studied in the regge limit of qcd using the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) framework @xcite , and it was shown that the discrepancy between data and theory in the region of small values of @xmath11 may be accounted for by the bfkl pomeron . however , pomeron exchange should be a dominant mechanism only at asymptotically large energies .",
    "in fact , in the energy range of the tevatron and the lhc , the mechanism of reggeized gluon and quark exchange should be more adequate .",
    "later , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the infrared - stable single jet inclusive cross section was calculated at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the framework of high - energy factorization using the unintegrated gluon pdf of the asymptotic bfkl approach and the one simply obtained by differentiating the collinear one w.r.t .",
    "the scale parameter , in compliance with bfkl evolution .",
    "the scatterings of off - shell partons were described by generalized cross sections calculated in the qmrk approach @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of collinear factorization , nlo corrections were found to diminish the single jet inclusive cross section in the framework of high - energy factorization . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the region of very small jet transverse momentum , @xmath12  gev , was analyzed , which lies far below the @xmath1 range studied experimentally at the tevatron and the lhc , @xmath13  gev , so that the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite can not be tested . also taking into account that the unintegrated gluon pdfs are so far not well constrained",
    ", we consider the result of ref .",
    "@xcite to be preliminary and approximate .",
    "the parton reggeization framework @xcite is particularly appropriate for this kind of high - energy phenomenology .",
    "it is based on an effective quantum field theory implemented with the non - abelian gauge - invariant action including fields of reggeized gluons @xcite and reggeized quarks @xcite .",
    "recently , this approach was successfully applied to interpret the production of prompt photons @xcite , diphotons @xcite , charmed mesons @xcite , bottom - flavored jets @xcite , charmonia @xcite , and bottomonia @xcite as measured at the tevatron and at desy hera in the small-@xmath14 regime . in this paper",
    ", we continue our work in the parton reggeization framework by studying the distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity ( @xmath15 ) of single jet and prompt - photon inclusive hadroproduction .",
    "we assume the mrk production mechanism to be the dominant one at small @xmath14 values . we compare our results with experimental data taken by the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations at the tevatron with @xmath16  tev and 1.96  tev and by the atlas collaboration @xcite at the lhc with @xmath17  tev .",
    "we also present predictions for the @xmath1 and @xmath15 distributions of single jet and prompt - photon inclusive production at the lhc with @xmath18  tev .",
    "we examine single jet and prompt - photon inclusive production in proton - antiproton collisions at the tevatron and in proton - proton collisions at the lhc . to leading order ( lo ) in the parton reggeization framework ,",
    "the relevant hard - scattering processes are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a reggeized gluon , @xmath22 is a yang - mills gluon , @xmath23 is a reggeized quark , and @xmath24 is a photon . working in the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",

    "for the reader s convenience , we also present here a compact formula for the double differential distribution in @xmath69 and @xmath15 , which follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsrrg ] ) and reads : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the azimuthal angle enclosed between @xmath36 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 in the case of single prompt - photon inclusive production , we take the first three quark flavors , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , to be active . since we work at lo , the produced jet has zero invariant mass @xmath77 , so that transverse energy @xmath78 and transverse momentum @xmath1 coincide and so do rapidity @xmath79 $ ] and pseudorapidity @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the angle enclosed between the jet and beam axes .",
    "the unintegrated pdfs @xmath82 are related to their collinear counterparts @xmath83 by the normalization condition , @xmath84 which yields the correct transition from formulas in the qmrk approach to those in the collinear parton model , where the transverse momenta of the partons are neglected . in our numerical analysis",
    ", we adopt as our default the prescription proposed by kimber , martin , and ryskin ( kmr ) @xcite to obtain unintegrated gluon and quark pdfs of the proton from the conventional integrated ones , as implemented in watt s code @xcite .",
    "as is well known @xcite , other popular prescriptions , such as those by blmlein ( b ) @xcite or by jung and salam @xcite , produce unintegrated pdfs with distinctly different @xmath0 dependences . in order to assess the resulting theoretical uncertainty",
    ", we also evaluate the unintegrated gluon pdf using the b approach , which resums small-@xmath85 effects according to the bfkl equation . as input for these procedures ,",
    "we use the lo set of the martin - roberts - stirling - thorne ( mrst ) @xcite proton pdfs as our default . in order to estimate the theoretical uncertainty due to the freedom in the choice of the pdfs",
    ", we also use the cteq6l1 set by the cteq collaboration @xcite as well as the glck - reya - vogt ( grv ) @xcite lo set .    throughout our analysis the renormalization and factorization scales",
    "are identified and chosen to be @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is varied between 1/2 and 2 about its default value 1 to estimate the theoretical uncertainty due to the freedom in the choice of scales .",
    "the resulting errors are indicated as shaded bands in the figures .",
    "we are now in a position to present our theoretical predictions and to compare them with experimental measurements .",
    "we first consider single jet inclusive production .",
    "recently , the cdf @xcite ( d0 @xcite ) collaboration presented new data from tevatron run  ii , which correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.13  fb@xmath88 ( 0.70  fb@xmath88 ) and cover the kinematic range 62  gev@xmath89  gev ( 50  gev@xmath90  gev ) and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the cdf and d0 data are compared with our mrk predictions in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] , respectively .",
    "we find good agreement for @xmath93  gev , which corresponds to @xmath94 , while our default predictions overshoot the data for larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "this may be understood by observing that the average values of the scaling variables @xmath95 and @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cxsrrg ] ) are of order @xmath14 , and the mrk picture ceases to be valid for @xmath97 . for @xmath98 , one needs to resort to the collinear parton model , which starts with @xmath99 partonic subprocesses at lo .",
    "since the unintegrated quark pdfs are greatly suppressed compared to the gluon one , the contributions due to partonic subprocesses involving reggeized quarks , such as @xmath100 and @xmath59 , are expected to be relatively small in the relevant @xmath14 range , @xmath98 .",
    "the predictions obtained using the b approach undershoot the default ones leading to a better description of the experimental data at large values of @xmath1 , where the mrk picture is , however , not expected to apply .",
    "however , they undershoot the experimental data at large values of @xmath101 throughout the whole @xmath1 range considered .    in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] , the theoretical uncertainties due to the fredom in the choices of the renormalization and factorization scales are indicated for the default predictions by the shaded bands .",
    "our limited knowledge of the unintegrated pdfs also contributes to the theoretical uncertainty . in figs .",
    "[ fig : uipdf1 ] and [ fig : uipdf2 ] , we investigate this source of theoretical uncertainty for the @xmath1 distribution of single jet inclusive hadroproduction in @xmath102 collisions with @xmath103  tev integrated over the rapidity intervals @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively . specifically , we consider the evaluations , for @xmath106 , with the cteq6l1 @xcite and grv lo @xcite pdfs normalized to the ones with the mrst lo pdfs @xcite .",
    "these ratios are typically well contained within the bands generated by varying @xmath87 between 1/2 and 2 in the evaluations with the mrst lo pdfs .",
    "we thus conclude that scale variations provide reasonable estimates of the overall theoretical uncertainties in the evaluations based on the kmr approach .    moving on from the tevatron to the lhc , which is currently running at @xmath17  tev",
    ", being about 3.5 larger than at the tevatron , one expects the @xmath1 range of validity of the mrk picture to be extended by the same factor , to @xmath107  gev .",
    "this expectation is nicely confirmed in figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] , where a recent measurement by the atlas collaboration @xcite , which is based on an integrated luminosity of 17  nb@xmath88 and covers the kinematic range 60  gev@xmath90  gev and @xmath108 , is compared with our mrk predictions for the @xmath1 and @xmath15 distributions , respectively .",
    "in fact , useful agreement is found even through the largest @xmath1 values accessed by this measurement .",
    "note that , in ref .",
    "@xcite , jets are identified using the anti-@xmath109 jet - clustering algorithm with two different values of the jet - size parameter @xmath110 , namely @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the atlas data shown in figs .  [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] refer to @xmath112 .",
    "the agreement is somewhat worse for @xmath111 .",
    "this may be understood by observing that the mrk picture assumes a strong hierarchy in @xmath15 and thus prefers a stronger isolation .",
    "our lo prediction does not yet depend on @xmath113 .    in figs .",

    "we find reasonable agreement through @xmath119  gev ( @xmath120  gev ) for the central events , with @xmath118 , from run  i @xcite ( run  ii @xcite ) , but only through @xmath121  gev for the forward events , with @xmath122 , from run  i @xcite .",

    "the agreement is found to be excellent , as expected because of the small @xmath14 values probed .",
    "finally , we repeat the mrk analyses of fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] for @xmath18  tev and show the results in fig .  [ fig:10 ] .",
    "the tevatron and , even more so , the lhc are currently probing particle physics at terascale c.m .",
    "energies @xmath127 , so that the hierarchy @xmath10 , which defines the mrk regime , is satisfied for a wealth of qcd processes of typical energy scale @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    ", we studied two qcd processes of particular interest , namely single jet and prompt - photon inclusive hadroproduction , at lo in the mrk approach , in which they are mediated by @xmath32 partonic subprocesses initiated by reggeized gluons and quarks , respectively . despite the great simplicity of our analytic expressions , we found excellent agreement with single jet @xcite and prompt - photon @xcite data taken just recently by the atlas collaboration in @xmath68 collisions with @xmath8  tev at the lhc .",
    "by contrast , in the collinear parton model of qcd , it is necessary to take into account nlo corrections and to perform soft - gluon resummation in order to obtain a comparable degree of agreement with the data , both for jet @xcite and prompt - photon @xcite inclusive production .",
    "however , our findings have to be taken with a grain of salt , since our lo approach does not yet accommodate the concepts of single - jet cone radius and prompt - photon isolation cone and neglects fragmentation to prompt photons .    on the other hand , comparisons with data taken by the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron in @xmath102 collisons with @xmath7  tev and 1.96  tev , which is roughly a factor of 3.5 below the value presently reached by the lhc , disclosed the limits of applicability of the mrk picture .",
    "in fact , the mrk approximation appears to break down for @xmath98 in the case of single jet production and somewhat below that in the case of single prompt - photon production .",
    "these findings are in line with our previous studies of the mrk approach , applied to the production of prompt photons @xcite , diphotons @xcite , charmed mesons @xcite , bottom - flavored jets @xcite , charmonia @xcite , and bottomonia @xcite . here and in refs .",

    "<S> , we find good agreement with measurements by the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron and by the atlas collaboration at the lhc in the region @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hadronic c.m .  </S>",
