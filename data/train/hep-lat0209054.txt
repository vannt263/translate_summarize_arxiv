    "qcd at finite baryon - number density describes nuclear matter including neutron stars and heavy nuclei .",
    "nuclear matter at finite temperature may be observed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at cern and rhic .",
    "because of the sign / phase difficulties associated with simulating qcd at finite baryon - number chemical potential , we have been studying related theories with positive fermion determinants .",
    "in particular , we are studying qcd ( 2-flavours ) at finite chemical potential @xmath0 for isospin ( @xmath1 ) , at zero and finite temperature @xmath7 .",
    "this represents a surface in the phase diagram for nuclear matter , which exists at finite isospin ( @xmath1 ) density as well as finite baryon - number density .    from effective field theory ( chiral perturbation theory ) and other analyses ,",
    "we expect a @xmath8 transition at @xmath9 to a state with a charged pion condensate which breaks @xmath1 spontaneously , with the orthogonal charged pion state becoming a goldstone boson @xcite the transition is expected to be second order with mean - field critical exponents @xcite , a result which our simulations confirm @xcite .    for @xmath10",
    "there is a finite @xmath7 phase transition where the pion condensate evaporates .",
    "for @xmath0 large enough , this transition appears to be first order . at low @xmath7",
    "the transition at @xmath11 appears to be second order and mean field as it is for @xmath8 @xcite .    at @xmath12 ( @xmath13 )",
    "we know that there is a rapid crossover from ` hadronic matter ' to a ` quark - gluon ' plasma at @xmath14mev .",
    "this is the start of a line of such crossovers , which extends to finite @xmath0 . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "the swansea - bielefeld collaboration have noted that @xmath15 to the extent that @xmath16 is well defined for a crossover @xcite .",
    "the lattice quark action is @xmath17\\chi                     + i\\lambda\\epsilon\\bar{\\chi}\\tau_2\\chi\\right]\\ ] ] which has a positive fermion determinant .",
    "@xmath18 is the explicit @xmath1 breaking parameter , required to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking on a finite lattice .",
    "we are interested in @xmath19 .",
    "our zero temperature simulations were performed on an @xmath20 lattice at @xmath21 and @xmath22 at @xmath23 and @xmath24 , using the hybrid molecular - dynamics method with ` noisy ' fermions , and tuning to @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig : zerot ] shows the charged pion condensate for the @xmath21 runs , which shows evidence for a phase transition at @xmath2 to a state with a charged pion condensate at @xmath26 .",
    "the fit is to a mean - field scaling form suggested by effective lagrangian analyses .    for more details and measurements of other observables",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we have performed simulations on @xmath27 lattices to study the finite temperature ( @xmath7 ) behaviour of lattice qcd at finite @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "simulations at low @xmath28 ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) and hence @xmath7 have been performed , varying @xmath0 .",
    "again we find that there is a phase transition for @xmath26 at some @xmath31 , above which the system is in a phase characterized by a charged pion condensate which breaks @xmath1 spontaneously .",
    "the transition appears to be second order with mean - field critical exponents , as in the @xmath8 case .",
    "we have also performed simulations at fixed @xmath32 , increasing @xmath28 ( and hence @xmath7 ) until the pion condensate ` evaporates ' and the @xmath1 symmetry is restored . for large @xmath0",
    "this phase transition is sufficiently abrupt to suggest that the transition has become first order .",
    "we are currently repeating these simulations on a larger ( @xmath33 ) lattice to check that the transition is indeed first order .",
    "figure  [ fig : pi_mu8 ] shows the pion condensate for @xmath34 as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "the abrupt ` jump ' between @xmath35 and @xmath36 suggests a first order transition .",
    "preliminary simulations on a @xmath33 lattice indicate that there is such an abrupt transition between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the finite temperature crossover ( @xmath13 ) from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma extends to finite @xmath0 .",
    "we are running on @xmath27 lattices with @xmath22 and @xmath25 .",
    "for @xmath39 we set @xmath26 .    at small @xmath6",
    ", the swansea - bielefeld collaboration @xcite found that the phase @xmath40 of the fermion determinant was ` well - behaved '  @xmath41 and goes smoothly to @xmath42 as @xmath43 . as a consequence they expect , and find numerically by their series expansion methods , that @xmath15 to the extent that @xmath16 is well defined for a crossover .",
    "thus for small @xmath0 our simulations predict the small @xmath6 behaviour of @xmath16 .",
    "we have performed simulations at @xmath44 , and are currently running at @xmath45 , varying @xmath28 through the crossover regime , measuring the chiral condensate , wilson line , plaquette , isospin density and their susceptibilities , from which we will obtain the position of the crossover ( the maxima of the susceptibilities ) as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : chiral ] shows the chiral condensate measurements from these runs .",
    "we note that the temperature of the transition decreases _ slowly _ with increasing @xmath0 in qualitative agreement with the @xmath6 behaviour reported by others @xcite .",
    "at zero and low temperatures , there is some finite @xmath0 , @xmath46 say , above which @xmath1 is spontaneously broken by a charged pion condensate .",
    "this phase transition appears to be second order with mean - field critical exponents .",
    "simulations will be performed on a @xmath47 lattice to measure the spectrum of goldstone and pseudo - goldstone bosons , and to study instanton effects .",
    "for @xmath3 there is a finite temperature phase transition at which the pion condensate evaporates . for large @xmath0",
    "this transition appears to be first order .",
    "simulations on a @xmath33 lattice are being performed to check this .",
    "we are studying the crossover from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma at small @xmath0 and have confirmed that @xmath16 and hence @xmath4 decrease very slowly with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this observation will be made quantitative .",
    "this is made more interesting because at low @xmath0 , the @xmath0 and @xmath6 dependence of this transition are believed to be identical .",
    "simulations are planned to extend these studies of the @xmath0 dependence of the finite temperature transition to intermediate @xmath0 values .",
    "larger - lattice simulations are needed .",
