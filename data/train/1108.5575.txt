    "information retrieval ( ir ) systems decide about the relevance under conditions of uncertainty . as a measure of uncertainty is necessary , a probability theory defines the event space and the probability distribution .",
    "the research in probabilistic ir is based on the classical theory of probability , which describes events and probability distributions using , respectively , sets and set measures obeying the usual axioms stated in  @xcite .",
    "set theory is not the unique way to define probability though .",
    "if subsets and set measures are replaced by vector subspaces and space - based measures , we obtain an alternative theory called , in this paper , _ vector probability_. although this theory stems from quantum theory , we prefer to use `` vector '' because vectors are sufficient to represent events like sets represent events within classical probability , the latter being the feature of our interest , whereas the `` quantumness '' of ir is out of the scope of this paper , which explains that the replacement of classical with vector probability is crucial to ranking .    ranking is an essential task in ir .",
    "indeed , it should not come as a surprise that the probability ranking principle ( prp ) reported in  @xcite is by far the most important theoretical result to date because it is an incisive factor in effectiveness .",
    "although probabilistic ir systems reach good results , ranking is far from being perfect because irrelevant documents are often ranked at the top of , or useful units are missed from the retrieved document list .    besides the definition of weighting schemes and ranking algorithms , new results can be achieved if the research in ir views problems from a new theoretical perspective .",
    "we propose vector probability to describe the events and probabilities underlying an ir system .",
    "we show that ranking in accordance with vector probability is more effective than ranking in accordance with classical probability , given that the same evidence is available for probability estimation .",
    "the effectiveness is measured in terms of probability of correct decision or , equivalently , of probability of error .",
    "the result is proved mathematically and verified experimentally .",
    "although the use of the mathematical apparatus of quantum theory is pivotal in showing the superiority of vector probability ( at least in terms of retrieval effectiveness ) , this paper does not necessarily end in an investigation or assertion of quantum phenomena in ir .",
    "rather , we argue that vector probability and then quantum theory is sufficient to go beyond the state of the art of ir , thus supporting the hypothesis stated in  @xcite according to which quantum theory may pave the way for a breakthrough in ir research .",
    "we organize the paper as follows .",
    "the paper gives an intuitive view of the our contribution in section  [ sec : intuitive - view ] and sketches how an ir system built on the premise of quantum theory can outperform any other system .",
    "section  [ sec : prob - relev ] briefly reviews the classical probability of relevance before introducing the notion of vector probability in section  [ sec : vect - prob ] .",
    "section  [ sec : optim - observ ] is one of the central sections of the paper because it introduces the optimal vectors which are exploited in section  [ sec : vect - prob - relev-1 ] where we provide our main result , that is , the fact that a system that ranks documents according to the probability of occurrence of the optimal vectors in the documents is always superior to a system which ranks documents according to the classical probability of relevance which is based on sets .",
    "section  [ sec : getting - beyond - state ] addresses the case of bm25 and how it can be framed within the theory .",
    "an experimental study is illustrated in section  [ sec : experiments ] for measuring the degree to which vector probabilistic models outperforms classical probabilistic models if a realistic test collectio is used .",
    "the feasibility of the theory is strongly dependent on the existence of an oracle which tells whether optimal vector occur in documents ; this issue is discussed in section  [ sec : regarding - oracle ] . after surveying the related work in section  [ sec : related - work ] ,",
    "we conclude with section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the appendix includes the definitions used in the paper and the proofs of the theoretical results .",
    "before entering into mathematics , figure  [ fig : ir - decision ] depicts an intuitive view of what is illustrated in the rest of the paper .",
    "suppose that relevance and non - relevance are two events @xmath0 occurring with prior probability @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "document a is in either relevant or non - relevant .",
    "let s view a as an emitter of binary symbols @xmath3 referring to presence or absence of a given index term .",
    "( we use the binary symbol and relevance for the sake of clarity . ) on the other side , an ir system b acts as a detector which has to decide whether a symbol comes out from either a relevant or a non - relevant document .",
    "the b s decision is taken on the basis of some feedback mechanism and on the relevance and non - relevance probability distributions which has been appropriately estimated on received symbols .",
    "an ir system that implements classical probability decides about relevance without any transformation of the received symbols ( figure  [ ir - decision - a ] ) whereas a ir system that implements vector probability decides about relevance after a transformation of the received symbols carried out by an oracle which outputs new symbols which can not be straightforwardly derived from the received symbols ( figure  [ ir - decision - b ] ) but can be defined as vectors  @xcite . in this paper , we show that when b is equipped with such an oracle , then it does significantly outperform any other ir system which implements any classical probabilistic model .",
    "we theoretically measure the improvement in effectiveness on the basis of a mathematical proposition which holds for every ir system described in figure  [ fig : ir - decision ] .",
    "an ir system performing like detector b of figure  [ ir - decision - a ] computes the probabilities that a symbol ( e.g. , an index term ) occurs in relevant documents and in non - relevant documents . according to the intuitive view in terms of emitters and detectors provided in section  [ sec : intuitive - view ] , the probability that a symbol ( e.g. , an index term ) occurs in relevant documents and in non - relevant documents is called , respectively , _ probability of detection _ ( @xmath4 ) and _ probability of false alarm _ ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "these probabilities are also known as expected recall and fallout , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the system decides whether a document is retrieved by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an appropriate threshold , and ranks the retrieved documents by using the left side of  .",
    "for instance , when indipendent bernoulli random variables are used , we have that @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the probabilities that term @xmath10 occurs in relevant , non - relevant documents and the @xmath11 s belong to the region of acceptance .",
    "depending on the available evidence the probabilities are estimated as accurately as possible and are transformed into weights ( e.g. , the binary weight or the bm25 illustrated in  ) .",
    "the probability ranking principle ( prp ) defines the optimal document subsets in terms of expected recall and fallout .",
    "thus , the optimal document subsets are those maximizing effectiveness .",
    "the prp states that , if a cut - off is defined for expected fallout , that is , probability of false alarm , we would maximize expected recall if we included in the retrieved set those documents with the highest probability of relevance  @xcite , that is , probability of detection .",
    "when a collection is indexed , each document belongs to subsets labeled by the document index terms and the documents in a subset are indistinguishable .",
    "in fact , optimally ranks subsets whose documents are represented in the same way ( e.g. , the documents which are indexed by a given group of terms or share the same set of feature values ) . in terms of decision , if fallout is fixed , the prp permits to decide whether a document ( subset ) should be retrieved with the minimum probability of error .",
    "when using classical probability term occurrence would correspond to disjoint document subsets ( i.e. , a subset corresponds to an index term occurring in every document of the subset ) .",
    "when using vector probability , term occurrence corresponds to a document vector subspace which is spanned by the orthonormal vector either @xmath12 or @xmath13 representing , respectively , absence and presence of a given term .",
    "( for the sake of clarity , we consider a single term , binary weights and binary relevance as depicted in figure  [ fig : ir - decision ] . )    as relevance is an event , two vectors represent binary relevance : a relevance vector @xmath14 represents non - relevance state and an orthogonal relevance vector @xmath15 represents relevance state .",
    "relevance vectors and occurrence vectors belong to a common vector space and thus can be defined in terms of a given orthonormal basis of that space .    in a vector space ,",
    "a random variable is a collection of values and of vectors ( or projectors ) .",
    "the vectors are mutually _ orthonormal _ and 1:1 correspondence with the values .",
    "let @xmath16 be a random variable value ( e.g. , term occurrence ) and @xmath17 be a conditioning event ( e.g. , relevance ) .",
    "in quantum theory , @xmath18 is also known as state vector and is a specialization of a density operator , that is , a hermitian and unitary trace operator .",
    "the vector probability that @xmath19 is observed given @xmath20 is @xmath21 .",
    "when a density operator @xmath22 and an event is represented by projector @xmath23 , the vector probability of the event conditioned to the density operator is given by born s rule , that is , @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath25 and @xmath26 , vector probability is a specialization of born s rule .",
    "( see  @xcite . )",
    "it is possible to show that    [ sec : vect - prob - relev ] a classical probability distribution can be equivalently expressed using vector probability .",
    "the proof is in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we reformulate the prp by replacing subsets with vector subspaces , namely , we replace the notion of optimal document subset with that of optimal vectors ( or , vector subspaces ) .",
    "such a reformulation allows us to compute the optimal vectors that are more effective than the optimal document subsets . to this end",
    ", we define a density matrix representing a probability distribution that has no counterpart in , but that is an extension of classical probability .",
    "such a density matrix is the outer product of a relevance vector by itself .",
    "when classical probability is assumed , a decision under uncertainty conditions taken upon this density matrix is equivalent to   as illustrated in  .",
    "( see the appendix and   as for the details . )",
    "when vector probability is assumed , a decision under uncertainty conditions taken upon this density matrix is based upon a different region of acceptance . hence , we leverage the following helstrom s lemma because it is the rule to compute the optimal vectors .",
    "[ the : helstrom ] let @xmath27 be the relevance vectors .",
    "the optimal vectors @xmath28 at the highest probability of detection at every probability of false alarm is given by the eigenvectors of @xmath29 whose eigenvalues are positive .",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the optimal vectors always exist due to the spectral decomposition theorem  @xcite ; therefore they are mutually orthogonal because are eigenvectors of  ; moreover , they can be defined in the space spanned by the relevance vectors .",
    "the angle between the relevance vectors @xmath27 determines the geometry of the decision of the emitter of figure  [ ir - decision - b ]    geometry means the probability distributions of the events .",
    "therefore , the probability of correct decision and the probability of error are given by the angle between the two relevance vectors and by the angles between the vectors and the relevance vectors .",
    "figure  [ fig : geometry - a ] depicts the geometry of the optimal vectors .",
    "( the figure is in the two - dimensional space for the sake of clarity , but the reader should generalize to higher dimensionality than two . )",
    "suppose @xmath30 are two any other vectors .",
    "the angles @xmath31 between the vectors and the relevance vectors @xmath32 are related with the angle @xmath33 between @xmath34 because the vectors are always mutually orthogonal and then the angle is @xmath35 .",
    "the optimal vectors are achieved when the angles between an vector and a relevance vector are equal to @xmath36 the rotation of the non - optimal vectors such that   holds , yields the optimal vectors @xmath37 as figure  [ fig : geometry - b ] illustrates : the optimal vectors are `` symmetrically '' located around the relevance vectors . if any two vectors are rotated in an optimal way , we can achieve the most effective document vector subspaces ( or , vectors ) in terms of expected recall and fallout . these vectors can not be ascribed to the subsets yielded by dint of the prp , the latter impossibility being called incompatibility  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we leverage lemma  [ the : helstrom ] to introduce the optimal vectors in ir . we define @xmath14 and @xmath15 as : @xmath38 note that , according to born s rule @xmath39 and @xmath40 , thus reproduce the classical probability distributions .",
    "if the oracle of figure  [ ir - decision - b ] exists , an ir system performing like detector b computes the probabilities that the transformation of a binary symbol referring to an index term , into @xmath41 or @xmath42 occurs in relevant documents and in non - relevant documents .",
    "the former is called _ vector probability of detection _ ( @xmath43 ) and the latter is called _ vector probability of false alarm _ ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "these probabilities are the analogous of @xmath45 .",
    "but , if @xmath46 are the mutually exclusive symbols yielded by the oracle , we have that @xmath47 the latter expression is _ not _ the same probability distribution as   because it refers to different events . according to  @xcite , we have that the _ vector probability of error _ and the _ vector probability of correct decision _ are defined , respectively , as @xmath48 both probabilities depend on @xmath49 which is a measure of the distance between two probability distributions as proved in  @xcite . as the probability distributions refer to relevance and non - relevance , @xmath50 is a measure of the distance between relevance and non - relevance .",
    "an example may be useful .",
    "suppose , for example , that the probability distributions are @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "if relevance and non - relevance are equiprobable , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "when @xmath55 , the optimal vectors are the eigenvectors of @xmath56 that is , @xmath57 these vectors can be computed in compliance with  .",
    "hence , @xmath58 , which is less than @xmath59 .    the following theorem that is our main result shows that the latter example is not an exception .    [ sec : optim - prob - rank-1 ] if @xmath60 are two arbitrary probability distributions conditioned to @xmath61 , the latter indicating the probability distribution of term occurrence in non - relevant documents and in relevant documents , respectively , then @xmath62    see section  [ sec : proof - prop - refs ] .",
    "hence , if we were able to find the optimal vectors , retrieval performance of the detector b of figure  [ fig : geometry - b ] would _ always _ be higher than retrieval performance of the detector b of figure  [ fig : geometry - a ] .",
    "the development of the theory assumed binary weights for the sake of clarity . in the event of non - binary weights ,",
    "e.g. , bm25 , we slightly fit the theory as follows .",
    "if we do the development of the bm25 illustrated in   in reverse , we can find that the underlying probability distribution is @xmath63 thus @xmath64 is the probability that @xmath65 for term @xmath10 is observed under state @xmath66 .",
    "( @xmath67 is just a normalization factor . )",
    "if @xmath64 estimates @xmath68 , the theory still works because theorem  [ sec : optim - prob - rank-1 ] is independent of the estimation of @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ir - decision - c ] depicts an ir system equipped with an oracle based on vector probability estimated with bm25 .",
    "otherwise . the system b trains the probability distributions using the saturation values .",
    "rather that applying logarithms and computing the bm25 weights , b invokes the oracle that produces the vectors . ]",
    "in this section we report an experimental study .",
    "our study differs from the common studies conducted in usual ir evaluation because : ( 1 ) theorem  [ sec : optim - prob - rank-1 ] already proves that an ir system working as the detector of figure  [ fig : geometry - b ] will always be more effective than any other system , therefore , if the former were available , every test would confirm the theorem ; ( 2 ) as an experimentation that compare two systems using , say , mean average precision requires the implementation of the oracle , which can not be at present implemented , what we can measure is only the degree to which an ir system working as the detector of figure  [ fig : geometry - b ] will outperform any other system .",
    "we have tested the theory illustrated in the previous sections through experiments based on the tipster test collection , disks 4 and 5 .",
    "the experiments aimed at measuring the difference between @xmath59 and @xmath69 by means of a realistic test collection . to this end , we have used the trec-6 , 7 , 8 topic sets .",
    "the queries are topic titles .",
    "we have implemented the following test : @xmath70 has been computed for each topic , query word and @xmath71 by means of the usual relative frequency of the word within relevant ( @xmath72 ) or non - relevant ( @xmath73 ) documents . in particular , @xmath74 means presence , @xmath75 means absence .",
    "thus , @xmath76 is the estimated probability of occurrence in non - relevant documents and @xmath77 is the estimated probability of occurrence in relevant documents .",
    "we have shown in section  [ sec : getting - beyond - state ] that the improvement is independent of probability estimation and then of term weighting .",
    "consider word ` crime ` of topic no .",
    "301 ; we have that @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "hence , @xmath80 .",
    "( relevance and non - relevance probability distributions are very close to each other . )",
    "estimation has taken advantage of the availability of the relevance assessments and thus it has been computed on the basis of the explicit assessments made for each topic .",
    "figure  [ fig : t301-crime ] depicts @xmath81 as function of the prior probability @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath69 is always greater than @xmath59 for every prior probability @xmath2 .",
    "the vertical distance between the curves is due to the value of @xmath50 , which also yields the shape of the @xmath69 curve , meaning that ` crime ` discriminates between relevant and non - relevant documents to an extent depending on @xmath50 and @xmath2 .",
    "the average curves computed over all the query words and depicted in figure  [ fig : t301 ] give an idea of the overall discriminative power of the topic .",
    "in particular , if the total frequencies within relevant and non - relevant documents are computed for each query word and a given topic , average probability of error is computed , for each prior probability . when @xmath2 is close to @xmath82 , the curves are indistinguishable because @xmath50 is very close to @xmath83 .",
    "the situation radically changes when topic no .",
    "344 is considered because @xmath84 ; indeed , figure  [ fig : t344 ] confirms that @xmath85 when @xmath86 .",
    "and @xmath69 plotted against @xmath2 for word ` crime ` of topic @xmath87.,width=566 ]     and @xmath69 plotted against @xmath2 for topic @xmath87.,width=566 ]     and @xmath69 plotted against @xmath2 for topic @xmath88.,width=566 ]    we have also investigated the event that explicit relevance assessment can not be used because of the lack of reliable judgements for a suitable number of documents . in this event , it is customary to state that @xmath89 and @xmath90  .",
    "although pseudo - relevance data is assumed , @xmath50 and @xmath59 can still be computed as function of @xmath76 because the latter are still valid estimations . in particular , we have that @xmath91        thus , we can analyze the probabilities of error as functions of @xmath2 and @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig : noqrel ] depicts how @xmath81 change with @xmath2 and @xmath76 ; this plot does not depend on a topic , it rather depends on @xmath76 , which is a measure of discrimination power of a query word since @xmath92 .",
    "the plot confirms the intuition that @xmath59 increases when @xmath76 increases , that is , when idf decreases .",
    "in particular , @xmath81 are close to each other when little information about the proportion of relevant documents is available ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) and the idf is not large enough to make a term discriminative .",
    "nevertheless , if some information about the proportion of relevant documents is available ( i.e. , @xmath2 approaches either @xmath83 or @xmath94 ) , @xmath69 becomes much smaller than @xmath59 even when the idf is small ( see the bottom - right side of the plot of figure  [ fig : noqrel ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab : avrelfreq - topic ] reports the average relative topic word frequency for each topic computed over the query words .",
    "the relative frequency gives a measure of query difficulty and can be used to `` access '' to the plot of figure  [ fig : noqrel ] to have an idea of @xmath59 when using a classical probabilistic ir model and of the improvement that can be achieved through an oracle which can produce the optimal vectors on the basis of the same available evidence as that used to estimate the @xmath70 s .",
    "this section explains why the design of the oracle is difficult . to this end",
    ", the section refers to some results of logic in ir reported in some detail in  @xcite .",
    "when binary term occurrence is considered , there are two mutually exclusive events , i.e. , either presence ( @xmath94 ) or absence ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the classical probability used in ir is based on neyman - pearson s lemma which states that the set of term occurrences can be partitioned into two disjoint regions : one region includes all the frequencies such that relevance will be accepted ; the other region denotes rejection . if a term is observed from documents and only presence / absence",
    "is observed , the possible regions of acceptance are @xmath95 . when using vectors , the regions of acceptance are @xmath96 which are the projectors to , respectively , the null subspace , the subspace spanned by @xmath12 , the subspace spanned by @xmath13 , and the entire space .",
    "consider the symbols @xmath97 emitted by the oracle .",
    "vector probability is based on lemma  [ the : helstrom ] which states that the set of symbols can be partitioned into two disjoint regions : one region includes all the symbols such that relevance will be accepted ; the other region denotes rejection  @xcite . if a symbol is observed from the oracle , the regions of acceptance are @xmath98 .     and @xmath99 yields the vertical plane , which is spanned by @xmath100 and @xmath101 too .",
    "if @xmath101 is intersected by the plane , the result is @xmath101 .",
    "but , if @xmath101 is intersected by @xmath102 and then by @xmath99 , the span of the two intersections is @xmath103 .",
    "that is , the distributive law is not admitted by vectors . ]",
    "the problem is that the subspaces spanned by @xmath97 can not be defined in terms of _ set _ operations on the subspaces spanned by @xmath104 .",
    "vector subspaces are equivalent to subsets and they then can be subject to set operations _ if _ they are mutually orthogonal  @xcite .    to explain the incompatibility between sets and vectors , we illustrate the fact that the distributive law can not be admitted in vector spaces as it is in set spaces .",
    "figure  [ fig : subspaces ] shows a three - dimensional vector space spanned by @xmath105 .",
    "the ray ( i.e. one - dimensional subspace ) @xmath106 is spanned by @xmath99 , the plane ( i.e. two - dimensional subspace ) @xmath107 is spanned by @xmath108 .",
    "note that @xmath109 and so on . according to  @xcite ,",
    "consider the vector subspace @xmath110 provided that @xmath111 means `` intersection '' and @xmath112 means `` span '' ( and not set union ) . since @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "however , @xmath115 because @xmath116 and @xmath117 , therefore @xmath118 thus meaning that the distributive law does not hold , hence , set operations can not be applied to vector subspaces .",
    "incompatibility , that is , the invalidity of the distributive law , is due to the obliquity of the vectors .",
    "thus , the optimal vectors can not be defined in terms of occurrence vectors due to obliquity and a new `` logic '' must be searched .",
    "the precedent example points out the issue of the measurement of the optimal vectors .",
    "measurement means the actual finding of the presence / absence of the optimal vectors via an instrument or device .",
    "the measurement of term occurrence is straightforward because term occurrence is a physical property measured through an instrument or device .",
    "( a program that reads texts and writes frequencies is sufficient . )",
    "the measurement of the optimal vectors is much more difficult because to our knowledge any physical property does not correspond to an optimal vector .    despite the difficulty of measuring optimal vectors ,",
    "one of the main advantages of vector probability and the results reported in this paper is that the effort to design the oracle for any other medium than text is comparable to the effort to design the oracle for text because the limits to observability of the features corresponding to the optimal vectors are actually those undergone when the informative content of images , video and music must be represented .",
    "thus , the question is : what should we observe from a document so that the outcome corresponds to the optimal vector ?",
    "the question is not futile because the answer(s ) would effect automatic indexing and retrieval .",
    "van rijsbergen s book  @xcite is the point of departure of our work .",
    "it introduced a formalism based on the hilbert spaces for representing the ir models within a uniform framework .",
    "as the hilbert spaces have been used for formalizing quantum theory , the book has also suggested the hypothesis that quantum phenomena have their analogues in ir . in this paper , we are not much interested in investigating whether quantum phenomena have their analogues in ir , in contrast , we use hilbert vector spaces for describing probabilistic ir models and for defining more powerful retrieval functions .",
    "the latter use of vector spaces in our paper hinges on helstrom s book  @xcite , which provides the theoretical foundation for the vector probability and the optimal vectors .",
    "in particular , it deals with optical communication and the detectability of optical signals and the improvement of the radio frequency - based methods with which their parameters can be estimated . within this domain",
    ", helstrom provides the foundations of quantum theory for deciding among alternative probability distributions ( e.g. relevance _ versus _ non - relevance , in this paper ) . in this paper",
    ", we point to a parallel between signal detection and relevance detection by corresponding the need to ferret weak signals out of random background noise to the need to ferret relevance out of term occurrence .",
    "thus , in this paper , quantum theory plays the role of enlarging the horizon of the possible probability distributions from the classical mixtures used to define classical distributions to quantum superpositions  , although decision under conditions of uncertainty can still be treated by the theory of statistical decisions developed by , for example ,   and used in ir too .",
    "eldar and forney s paper   gives an algorithm for computing the optimal vectors and obtains a new characterization of optimal measurement , and prove that it is optimal in a least - squares sense .",
    "@xmath50 is the distance between densities defined in  @xcite and is implemented as the squared cosine of the angle between the subspaces corresponding to the relevance vectors .",
    "the justification of viewing @xmath50 as a distance comes from the fact that `` the angle in a hilbert space is the only measure between subspaces , up to a constant factor , which is invariant under all unitary transformations , that is , under all possible time evolutions . ''",
    "@xcite the latter is the justification given in  @xcite of the use of born s rule for computing what we call vector probability .",
    "hughes book  @xcite is an excellent introduction to quantum theory .",
    "in particular , it addresses incompatibility between observables  ",
    "we have used that explanation to illustrate the difficulty in implementing the oracle of figure  [ ir - decision - b ] . however , in  @xcite , there is no mention of optimal vectors .",
    "an introduction to quantum phenomena ( i.e. , interference , superposition , and entanglement ) and information retrieval can be found in  .",
    "in contrast , we do not address quantum phenomena because our aims is to leverage vector space properties in conjunction with probability .    in the ir literature",
    ", quantum theory is receiving more and more interest . in   the authors",
    "propose quantum formalism for modeling some ir tasks and information need aspects .",
    "in contrast , our paper does not limit the research to the application of an abstract formalism , but exploits the formalism to illustrate how the optimal vectors significantly improve effectiveness . in  , the authors propose @xmath50 for modifying probability of relevance ; @xmath50 in conjunction with a cosine of the angle of a complex number are intended to model quantum correlation ( also known as interference ) between relevance assessments .",
    "the implementation of interference is left to the experimenter and that paper provides some suggestions .",
    "while   shows that vector probability induces a different prp ( called quantum prp ) , this paper shows that vector probability always induces a more powerful ranking than prp .",
    "the research in ir has been traditionally concentrated on extracting and combining evidence as accurately as possible in the belief that the observed features ( e.g. , term occurrence , word frequency ) have to ultimately be scalars or structured objects .",
    "the quest for reliable , effective , efficient retrieval algorithms requires to implement the set of features as best one can .",
    "the implementation of a set of features is thus an `` answer '' to an implicit `` question '' , that is , which is the best _ set _ of features for achieving effectiveness as high as possible ?",
    "however , the research in ir often yields incremental results , thus arising the need to achieve an even better answer . to this end",
