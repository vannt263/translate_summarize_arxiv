    "in this paper we present the results of a computer simulation designed to study the nonlocal dc conductivity of a two - dimensional ( thin film ) type - ii superconductor .",
    "the meaning of nonlocal in this context can be seen in the standard expression connecting the local current density in a material , @xmath0 , to the local electric field , @xmath1 , in the linear ( ohmic ) regime : @xmath2 when the conductivity , @xmath3 , is nonzero for @xmath4 , then it is nonlocal . in a translationally invariant system ,",
    "the nonlocal conductivity can only be a function of the difference @xmath5 .",
    "the fourier transform of the conductivity equation is then @xmath6 .",
    "the nonlocal conductivity we are discussing here is a different phenomenon from pippard s nonlocal relation between the supercurrent and the vector potential below @xmath7 in a type - i superconductor.@xcite in particular , we are interested in the nonlocal conductivity in the resistive vortex - liquid regime of a type - ii superconductor in a magnetic field .",
    "all materials exhibit nonlocal transport properties on some length scale .",
    "normal metals behave nonlocally on length scales less than or of the order of the inelastic mean free path . in superconductors , however , the scale of the nonlocality can be much larger .",
    "israeloff , _ et al._@xcite have measured effects arising from the nonlocal resistivity due to superconducting fluctuations just above @xmath7 in one dimensional rings of type - i material .",
    "the observed behavior , predicted by glazman , _ et al._,@xcite arises from the correlations of the superconducting order parameter .    in the mixed state of a type - ii superconductor , the presence of vortices provides another mechanism for nonlocal resistivity . when a current @xmath8 exerts lorentz and magnus forces on a vortex segment at @xmath9 and causes it to move , this vortex motion can in turn cause vortex segments at @xmath10 to move , through vortex interactions , connections or entanglement .",
    "the motion of the vortices at @xmath10 produces phase - slip and electric fields at @xmath10 , as described by the josephson relation , completing a nonlocal relation between current and electric field .",
    "such nonlocal resistivity over length scales of tens of microns has been observed in bulk crystals of the high - temperature superconductor ybco by safar , _",
    "et al_.@xcite and discussed phenomenologically by huse and majumdar .    in a recent paper with mou and dorsey,@xcite we examined the nonlocal dc transport properties throughout the phase diagram of a type - ii superconductor , using analytic calculations where possible and proposing phenomenological arguments elsewhere .",
    "in particular , we predicted that the wavevector - dependent dc electrical conductivity , @xmath11 , of a type - ii superconductor would have a nonmonotonic dependence on @xmath12 in a certain region of the phase diagram : for those values of magnetic field and temperature at which there exists a well - correlated liquid of field - induced vortices , the dc conductivity as a function of increasing wavevector , @xmath12 , was argued to increase for small values of @xmath12 and then decrease at large values of @xmath12 .",
    "the increase in the conductivity at small @xmath12 arises from viscous drag between vortices which impedes their relative motion and therefore decreases their contribution to resistance in a nonuniform current .",
    "however , when the length scale of the nonuniformity in the current is smaller than the intervortex spacing ( high @xmath12 ) , the conductivity is more determined by the short - distance correlations of the superconducting order parameter , rather than the vortex interactions . in this short - distance regime",
    "the behavior is as in zero magnetic field : the conductivity decreases with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "because this effect is only expected to appear in a regime with strong correlations and fluctuations , analytical calculations do not appear feasible .",
    "in the present paper we report on computer simulations of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation in two dimensions which allow us to study the nonlocal dc conductivity both in real space and in wavevector space as a function of magnetic field , @xmath13 , and temperature , @xmath14 . we have indeed observed the nonmonotonic @xmath12-dependence in the vortex - liquid regime , as expected.@xcite    to measure the nonlocal transport properties experimentally requires applying currents that are nonuniform on the appropriate length scale .",
    "this has been done in two types of experiments , so far.@xcite israeloff , _ et al._@xcite have made @xmath15m - size wire loops , applied the current asymmetrically , and measured resistances as a function of a magnetic flux passing through the loop .",
    "safar , _ et",
    "al._@xcite have applied contacts to both sides of @xmath16m - thick ybco samples , measuring effects due to the nonuniformity of the current across the sample .",
    "this latter experiment detected the nonlocal resistivity along the direction parallel to the vortex lines , due to the lines having integrity ( not breaking ) across the sample in a portion of the vortex - liquid regime .",
    "the present work indicates that the phenomenon is quite general , and could be studied in superconductors of any dimensionality .",
    "what is required is to be able to apply nonuniform currents and measure voltages on length scales of order the appropriate correlation length of the superconductor . with modern microfabrication techniques ( and/or possibly using scanning - tip probes )",
    "this should be feasible for a broader range of materials and geometries than those used in the two experiments discussed above .",
    "what would be best would be an experiment that simultaneously and quantitatively probes a range of length scales , so the dependence of the transport properties on length scale ( and other parameters ) can be systematically studied .",
    "we hope the results reported below help motivate such studies .",
    "an outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section ii describes the simulation .",
    "section iii outlines the phase diagram of a two dimensional superconductor , providing a context for our results .",
    "section iv describes the conductivity we observe in both real and wavevector space in the different regimes of the phase diagram . finally , in section",
    "v , the results are discussed , both in the context of earlier work and in terms of possible experiments .",
    "we wish to study the nonlocal conductivity of a two - dimensional ( thin - film ) sample of a strongly type - ii superconductor .",
    "we begin with the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation ( mksa units ) : @xmath17 @xmath18 is the superconducting order parameter .",
    "@xmath19 is the kinetic coefficient for the relaxation of the order parameter towards equilibrium , it is assumed to be real .",
    "@xmath20 is the effective mass of a cooper pair and @xmath21 is the charge of a cooper pair .",
    "the noise , @xmath22 , is gaussian distributed and @xmath23-function correlated , with the coefficient given by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the scalar and vector potentials , respectively .",
    "we consider the strongly type - ii ( large @xmath27 ) limit , where the order parameter fluctuations are much stronger than the magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "thus we use a uniform , static magnetic field .    to simplify this equation we rescale :",
    "energy is measured in units of @xmath28 .",
    "we work only below the mean field @xmath7 , so we set @xmath29 .",
    "the order parameter magnitude is measured in units of @xmath30 , its equilibrium value at zero noise and zero magnetic field ; therefore , @xmath31 .",
    "length is measured in units of @xmath32 , the order - parameter correlation length at zero noise and zero magnetic field , so @xmath33 .",
    "magnetic flux is measured in units such that the flux quantum is @xmath34 ; that is @xmath35 .",
    "time is measured in units of @xmath36 , so @xmath37 .",
    "we also take @xmath38 .",
    "the parameters remaining are the temperature , now measured in units of @xmath28 ; and the magnetic field , in units of flux quanta per area @xmath39 , or , equivalently , in units of the mean - field upper critical field , @xmath40 .",
    "the theory also needs an ultraviolet cutoff , which we realize in the simulations by discretizing space .",
    "note that when our rescaled temperature is large ( @xmath41 ) , this means @xmath42 , which is the regime of strong thermal fluctuations _ below _ the mean - field transition temperature , @xmath43 .",
    "the rescaled equation is @xmath44 to solve this equation , we discretize space and time .",
    "the film is approximated by a square lattice with spacing one in the rescaled units .",
    "time is divided into a series of time steps .",
    "the length of these time steps must be decreased at higher temperatures in order to obtain accurate steady - state results and avoid numerical instabilities .",
    "we used time steps in the range of 0.2 to 0.02 rescaled time units for temperatures ranging from 0 to 1 , respectively .",
    "taking advantage of the gauge invariance of the equation , we work in terms of only gauge - invariant quantities , namely , the order parameter magnitudes at each site of the lattice , @xmath45 , and the gauge - invariant phase differences along each nearest - neighbor link , @xmath46 , defined by @xmath47 where @xmath10 and @xmath48 are adjacent lattice points and the integral is along the straight line between them .",
    "derivatives are approximated using differences , and only differences up to one time step and two lattice spacings are kept ; this is the minimum needed to approximate the derivatives appearing in the tdgl equation .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in both the @xmath49 and @xmath50 directions , giving effectively a toroidal surface .",
    "we begin with random initial conditions , setting the gauge - invariant phase difference to a random number between @xmath51 and @xmath52 on three of the four links surrounding each plaquette ; the phase difference on the last link is then determined uniquely ( modulo @xmath53 ) by the magnetic flux passing through the plaquette .",
    "the order parameter magnitude begins at the small , spatially uniform value of 0.01 .",
    "our goal is to study the conductivity . to do this",
    "we apply an electric field and measure the electrical current .",
    "the tdgl equation in this type - ii limit only involves the supercurrent due to the paired electrons that produces enhanced conductivity over that of the normal state .",
    "the supercurrent , in our rescaled units , is @xmath54 this we also discretize as described above , so the supercurrent is defined on each nearest - neighbor link of the lattice as @xmath55 in addition to this supercurrent , there is also a normal current which we will assume is simply local and ohmic : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the normal - state conductivity .",
    "we generally apply an electric field that is uniform in the @xmath50 direction , parallel to @xmath58 and given by a @xmath23-function along @xmath49 : @xmath59 on the lattice this @xmath23-function is realized by applying the electric field only between two adjacent columns of lattice sites . in this geometry",
    "the resulting current is also parallel to @xmath58 and , in the linear response regime is given by @xmath60 thus we measure the dependence of the nonlocal conductivity on the spacing @xmath49 for conditions that are uniform along @xmath50 ( @xmath61 ) . by fourier transforming on @xmath49",
    "we also obtain @xmath62 .",
    "our simulation is designed to represent a superconducting film with thickness less than the bulk order - parameter correlation length .",
    "when there is no applied magnetic field , such a system is expected to undergo a kosterlitz - thouless transition at a temperature @xmath63.@xcite below this temperature there are bound pairs of vortices , but no free vortices and therefore no ohmic resistance to a uniform dc current . above @xmath63 , there are free vortices , whose mobility results in a nonzero resistivity .    when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane of such a film , the flux is not expelled . at low temperatures , a triangular vortex lattice forms . above the melting temperature , @xmath64",
    ", this lattice becomes unstable to dislocations and melts . at intermediate magnetic fields",
    " i.e. much less than the mean - field @xmath40 but greater than one flux quantum per magnetic penetration length squared ",
    "@xmath65 is expected to be only weakly field - dependent.@xcite in the limit of a normal - state sheet resistance much larger than the quantum of resistance , @xmath66 , @xmath67 in this intermediate field regime.@xcite when temperature is rescaled as we have done , this relation between @xmath65 and @xmath63 holds for films with smaller sheet resistance as well . at higher magnetic fields , near mean - field @xmath40 , @xmath68 for ginzburg - landau theory with thermal fluctuations.@xcite the locations of the phase transitions are roughly sketched in figure 1 .    to estimate the zero - field transition temperature",
    ", we used a finite - size scaling analysis of the order parameter phase correlations , obtaining @xmath69 , which implies @xmath70 in the intermediate field regime .",
    "we did not attempt to directly estimate @xmath65 by looking for the melting transition in our simulations .",
    "we also raised the applied field until the zero - temperature equilibrium order - parameter magnitude dropped to zero to find that @xmath71 . in the continuum , @xmath72 in our rescaled units ; the increase to roughly @xmath73 is due to our approximating the continuum by a lattice with spacing @xmath74 and approximating the spatial derivative with the lowest - order difference .",
    "we expect other quantities are also quantitatively shifted small amounts by these approximations .",
    "in particular , the precise values we obtain for the conductivity are likely to be affected . however , as we are focusing on trends related to the variation of @xmath49 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 rather than on precise numerical values , these shifts are not expected to affect our conclusions .",
    "we studied points in the phase diagram in the field range @xmath75 and the temperature range @xmath76 as shown in figure 1 . at most points we studied ,",
    "all the vortices present were field - induced .",
    "thermally - induced vortex - antivortex pairs were observed only for @xmath77 .",
    "however , the number of field - induced vortices was much greater than that of thermally - induced vortices for temperatures up to 0.5 at the nonzero field values studied .",
    "we saw three characteristic behaviors for the nonlocal conductivity .",
    "the points a , b , and c shown in figure 1 are chosen as clear examples of these behaviors . point a , at t=0.001 and h=@xmath78 , is representative of what is seen in the ordered phases at very low temperatures and fields , including t=0 and h=0 .",
    "point b , at t=0.04 and h=@xmath79 , is representative of the well - correlated vortex - liquid regime , intermediate in both temperature and field .",
    "vortices . finally , point c , at t=0.1 and h=@xmath80 , is representative of high temperature and high field behavior .    in linear response ,",
    "the nonlocal conductivity in real space , @xmath81 , for the characteristic points are as follows ( figure 2 ) : at point c , we see a conductivity which is sharply peaked around @xmath82 , falling off exponentially to zero with a length scale of order the correlation length .",
    "this behavior is in qualitative agreement with the high - temperature behavior obtained analytically from lowest - order fluctuations about the mean - field normal state.@xcite at point b the conductivity still has a sharp peak at @xmath82 of similar width to that at point c , but it then drops * below * zero over a distance of few intervortex spacings before returning to zero .",
    "this is the negative nonlocal conductivity expected in this well - correlated vortex - liquid regime.@xcite at both points b and c the conductivities and correlation lengths are all finite , so the numerical results for a finite sample that is large compared to all correlation lengths do not show finite - size effects and thus are a faithful representation of a much larger sample .    in the ordered phases the uniform conductivity is infinite . in the meissner phase ( @xmath83 )",
    "this is true for the continuum system as well , while for the vortex lattice phase the infinite uniform ( @xmath84 ) conductivity is due to weak pinning of the vortices to our numerically - imposed lattice that impedes the `` flux - flow '' that would occur for the continuum system . to avoid this divergence , instead of applying only the @xmath23-function electric field ( 2.7 ) as was done at points b and c , at point a",
    "we also apply a compensating spatially uniform electric field that cancels the uniform ( @xmath84 ) component coming from the @xmath23-function .",
    "this means we do not measure the very large @xmath84 part of the conductivity and the data for point a in the inset to figure 2 consequently has an arbitrary @xmath49-independent vertical shift .",
    "the conductivity vs. @xmath49 shows a broad peak at the origin , with a width and magnitude proportional to the linear sample size and a shape well fit by a parabola centered on the column opposite to where the @xmath23-function component of the electric field is applied .",
    "still in linear response , but now in @xmath12-space ( see figure 3 ) , at point c , the conductivity @xmath85 falls monotonically from its value at @xmath86 . at point b the conductivity rises from its value at @xmath84 to a maximum at a wavevector roughly corresponding to the inverse of the vortex spacing and then declines . at point",
    "a ( inset ) the conductivity falls off monotonically like @xmath87 , as expected.@xcite    at point b , when the system is driven beyond linear response , the effect is to reduce the magnitude both of the peak in @xmath88 and of the negative regions . in @xmath12 space ,",
    "the effect is to suppress the nonmonotonicity .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath89 for a series of applied electric fields of increasing magnitude . here in the nonlinear regime",
    "we apply the @xmath23-function electric field ( 2.7 ) , measure @xmath90 , define the nonlocal and nonlinear conductivity as @xmath91 , and show its fourier transform in figure 4 .",
    "the higher electric fields produce a strong shear flow in the vortex liquid , which apparently reduces the effective viscosity of the vortex liquid .    for points in the vortex liquid below the dashed line in figure 1 ,",
    "the nonlocal conductivity in @xmath12-space showed nonmonotonicity significantly outside the statistical errors . above this line nonmonotonic behavior",
    "is still observed at many points ; however , it is not possible to distinguish between true nonmonotonicity and statistical noise at these points , given the level of accuracy of the present data .",
    "thus the dashed line is actually a lower bound on the true boundary between monotonic and nonmonotonic @xmath11 .",
    "this boundary is only a crossover , not a phase transition ; it is roughly where the correlation length of the conductivity ( the range of the nonlocal conductivity in real space ) becomes comparable to the intervortex spacing .",
    "an interesting question is whether this boundary , like the melting line , intersects the zero - field axis at a temperature below @xmath63 .",
    "following this line to lower fields in our simulations is difficult .",
    "it goes to higher temperatures where smaller time steps are required for numerical stability .",
    "also , to study lower fields , larger samples are required in order to include a sufficient number of field - induced vortices and to probe distances well beyond the intervortex spacing . following the line to lower temperatures is also difficult . as it approaches the melting line , nonlinear response sets in at progressively lower applied electric fields , and longer runs",
    "are required in order to obtain good signal to noise ratios in the linear response regime .",
    "to discuss the phenomena we ve observed , and in particular to connect with experimental possibilities , it is useful to speak in terms of resistivity . @xmath92 is simply @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is its fourier transform .",
    "@xmath95 when @xmath96 , @xmath97 ^ 2 $ ] , and when @xmath98 , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the resistivity in real space , @xmath102 , for the case of very low normal - state conductivity is sketched in figure 5 using the nonmonotonic @xmath103 at point b from figure 3 .",
    "this shows the response of a film in the @xmath104 plane in a magnetic field parallel to @xmath105 to a current applied between two closely - spaced line contacts parallel to each other and to the @xmath50-axis , in the geometry shown in figure 6 .",
    "if the current contacts are sufficiently closely spaced to approximate well a @xmath23-function in current , the resulting electric field pattern is proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "the effect is as follows : when a current is applied in the @xmath49 direction between the two line contacts , the vortices which are positioned between the contacts feel a force in the @xmath107 direction .",
    "when they move in response to this force , the vortices near to but outside the region in which current is flowing are dragged along .",
    "an electric field will be seen between the two current contacts due to the phase - slip caused by the moving vortices as well as simply the flow of normal current .",
    "in addition , an electric field of the same sign will be present _ outside _ the region in which current is flowing , due to phase - slip generated by the vortices being dragged by their neighbors .",
    "the negative regions in the nonlocal resistivity at short distance are due to the supercurrent being nearly uniform on length scales shorter than the order - parameter correlation length .",
    "thus to get zero net current just outside of the current contacts in figure 6 a counterflowing normal current must be present to cancel the supercurrent there .",
    "this results in a negative nonlocal resistivity for distance @xmath49 shorter than the intervortex spacing , as seen in figure 5 .    returning to the conductivity measured in our simulation ,",
    "the negative regions observed in figure 2 for point b represent places where the current must flow in the opposite direction to that of the applied electric field in order to keep vortices stationary which would otherwise be dragged along by their moving neighbors .",
    "these negative regions in @xmath88 , at @xmath49 of order the intervortex spacing or more , correspond to the positive regions in @xmath108 for the same @xmath49 range , and both represent the effect of viscous drag between vortices in the liquid state .    to connect to the work in our earlier paper,@xcite in which @xmath109 was expanded as @xmath110",
    "our results indicate that @xmath111 is not always negative.@xcite at intermediate values of the temperature and field , @xmath111 is _ positive _ , corresponding to a conductivity that increases with increasing wavevector @xmath12 at small values of @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we showed previously that , when a hydrodynamic treatment is appropriate , the elements of the @xmath112 tensor can be written as linear combinations of the elements of the vortex - liquid viscosity tensor defined in the theory of marchetti and nelson . specifically , the element @xmath111 is proportional to the viscosity due to the variation in the @xmath49 direction of vortex motion in the @xmath50 direction .",
    "a positive @xmath111 corresponds to a positive vortex - liquid viscosity in a well - correlated liquid of field - induced vortices .",
    "however , the negative @xmath111 values obtained in the high @xmath14 and/or high @xmath13 regime should not be thought of as negative vortex - liquid viscosities .",
    "@xmath112 does not represent a vortex - liquid viscosity when the system can not be described hydrodynamically . at high temperatures and/or fields ,",
    "the correlation length of the conductivity is shorter than the spacing between vortices , and the value of @xmath112 comes from interactions not on the scale of vortices but on the shorter scale of the order - parameter correlation length .",
    "the conductivity decreases with increasing wavevector as in zero magnetic field .",
    "one view of this regime is that the vortex - liquid viscosity becomes so small that the other , shorter length scale contributions to the nonlocal conductivity dominate , even at small @xmath12 .    at intermediate fields and/or temperatures when a hydrodynamic picture is applicable ,",
    "there are actually two regimes : here we have presented data at intermediate temperatures and nonzero field where there is a well - correlated liquid of field - induced vortices . in this case",
    "the positive vortex - liquid viscosity causes moving vortices to drag along other parallel vortices , thereby producing a positive nonlocal resistivity for @xmath49 of order the intervortex spacing or larger , as in figure 5 . at temperatures just above the kosterlitz - thouless transition in zero field ,",
    "on the other hand , there is a neutral liquid of thermally - induced vortices _ and antivortices_. in this regime , a moving vortex is more likely to drag a nearby _ antivortex _ , which is attracted to it , than it is to drag one parallel to itself , so the usual positive vortex - liquid viscosity instead produces a negative nonlocal resistivity .",
    "we have not used our simulation to study this latter regime .",
    "it appears that experimental observation of these nonlocal transport properties of type - ii superconducting films is feasible .",
    "what is needed ?",
    "a high normal - state sheet resistance , @xmath113 , would maximize the extent of the fluctuation regime above the melting line , and it would also minimize the contribution of normal currents to measured quantities .",
    "vortex pinning should be weak enough so that the vortex - liquid regime of interest is not strongly pinned .",
    "many different sample geometries could satisfy the basic requirement that the applied current vary on a length scale of order the correlation length of the conductivity .",
    "point contacts in the middle or at the edge of the film would produce two - dimensional current patterns .",
    "line contacts allow one - dimensional patterns , including approximations to step - function or delta - function configurations .",
    "the latter is closest to what we have studied in our simulation .",
    "figure 6 shows an arrangement of a series of line contacts parallel to one another with spacings of order the intervortex spacing ( or , for @xmath83 , of order the order - parameter correlation length ) .",
    "current would be run between nearest - neighbor contacts j1 and j2 , and the voltage differences would be measured between the remaining contacts where there is no net current flowing . alternatively , a step - function applied current pattern could be made by passing current between two more widely separated line contacts in figure 6 .",
    "the three regimes would appear as follows : ( c ) in the high - temperature or high - field regime , including the normal state , the voltage difference between all v contacts not between the current contacts will be zero , because the resistivity is local on the length scales studied and no current flows there . however ,",
    "if the contact spacing is less than or of order the order - parameter correlation length , and well below the intervortex spacing , then the negative nonlocal resistivity should be seen as a negative electric field that falls off as one moves away from the current contacts .",
    "this latter regime should be what is seen on approaching @xmath7 from above for zero magnetic field .",
    "( a ) in the low - temperature , low - field regime , below the melting line , assuming the pinning is negligible , the linear - response electric field measured between each pair of neighboring v contacts will be equal and nonzero due to the uniform motion of the vortex lattice induced by the current .",
    "this is also assuming the current contacts are centered on the sample so the net torque on the vortex lattice vanishes .",
    "( b ) in the well - correlated vortex - liquid regime , the electric field a vortex spacing or more from the current flow will be positive , as the vortices in this region are dragged by their neighbors .",
    "this electric field will decrease with a vortex - liquid correlation length as one moves away from where the current is flowing .    to estimate the magnitude of the voltages expected , we need a value for the factor @xmath114 by which we have rescaled the electric potential .",
    "an estimate of @xmath115 can be obtained by comparing the theoretical expression for the fluctuation conductivity calculated using the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation , @xmath116 ( in two dimensions ) , with experimentally obtained values , as shown in the review by skocpol and tinkham .",
    "the result is a voltage scale of order @xmath117 for materials with bulk transition temperatures of order one kelvin .",
    "this value is the same as that obtained by dividing the characteristic energy @xmath118 by the electron charge . to obtain linear response at point b we had to decrease the voltage one to two orders of magnitude below this scale , thus to the order of microvolts .    as for the current , the factor by which it has been rescaled",
    "is @xmath119 .",
    "a rough estimate of its scale can be obtained by dividing the voltage scale by the quantum of resistance and by the order - parameter correlation length .",
    "the result is in the range @xmath120 .",
    "thus the relevant current and voltage scales appear to be well within the reach of present experimental technique ( although combining this with the small length - scales required may be quite a challenge ) .    to conclude",
    ", our simulation has displayed negative nonlocal conductivity in a vortex - liquid regime , which is distinct from the behavior of the vortex lattice and the higher temperature region .",
    "we believe that this signature of the well - correlated vortex liquid is experimentally observable and could provide useful information on vortex dynamics and interactions in type - ii superconductors .",
    "t. blum and m.a .",
    "moore ( preprint ) have presented an argument that the nonlocal conductivity @xmath85 in the vortex liquid will always have a local maximum at @xmath86 , in disagreement with our simulation results . however , their argument is based on an expansion around the normal state , and it is not clear why it should be trusted deep in the well - correlated vortex - liquid regime , which is where we see the nonmonotonicity in @xmath121 vs. @xmath122 .",

    "kes ( preprint ) reports a closely - related experiment .",
    "they pattern superconducting films with alternating strong- and weak - pinning channels and measure the voltages produced by uniform currents . by doing this for various channel widths , they are able to measure the vortex - liquid viscosity for the amorphous nb@xmath123ge films in the weak - pinning channels .",

    "<S> the effect is suppressed when driven beyond linear response . </S>",
    "<S> earlier work had predicted the existence of such a regime , due to the high viscosity of a strongly - correlated vortex liquid . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is clearly distinguishable from the monotonic spatial fall - off of the conductivity in the higher temperature or field regimes approaching the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> the possibilities for experimental study of the nonlocal transport properties are discussed . </S>"
