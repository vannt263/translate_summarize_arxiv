    "precise doppler velocity surveys of nearby stars have led to the detection of more than 250 extrasolar planets ( e.g.  marcy et al .  2005a ; butler et al .",
    "they have minimum masses from @xmath19 earth masses ( @xmath20 ) and up , orbital periods from close to one day up to several years , and a wide range of eccentricities .",
    "over 25 multiple planet systems are known , with many other single planet systems showing a long term velocity trend likely indicating a second planet with long orbital period ( fischer et al .",
    "the increasing number of detections allows us to answer questions about the statistical properties of extrasolar planetary systems , such as the mass , period , and eccentricity distributions ( tabachnik & tremaine 2002 ; butler et al .",

    "2006b ; endl et al .  2006 ; johnson et al .  2007 ) .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the frequency of planetary systems , and the distributions of mass and orbital periods .",
    "the frequency of planets is important for future astrometric and direct searches ( see e.g.  beuzit et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the details of the mass - orbital period distribution are important because they contain information about the planet formation process ( armitage et al .",
    "2002 ; ida & lin 2004a , 2004b , 2005 , 2008a , 2008b ; alibert et al .  2005 ; rice & armitage 2005 ; kornet & wolf 2006 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of planet masses and orbital periods for 182 planets announced as of march 2007 .",
    "several features of the mass - period distribution have been discussed in the literature : the `` pile - up '' at orbital periods of @xmath21 days ( the `` hot jupiters '' ) ( e.g.  see gaudi et al .",
    "2005 ) ; the paucity of massive planets ( @xmath22 ) in close orbits ( udry et al .  2002 , 2003 ;",
    "mazeh & zucker 2002 , 2003 ) ; the deficit of planets at intermediate orbital periods of @xmath23 and @xmath24 days , giving a `` period valley '' in the orbital period distribution ( jones et al .  2003 ; udry et al .  2003 ; burkert & ida 2007 ) ; and a suggestion that the lack of lower mass planets ( @xmath25 ) at orbital periods @xmath26@xmath14 days is significant and a real feature of the distribution ( udry et al .",
    "it has also been pointed out that the incidence and mass - period distribution of planets should depend on the mass of the host star .",
    "in particular , a much lower incidence of jupiter mass planets is expected around m dwarfs in the core accretion scenario for planet formation ( laughlin , bodenheimer , & adams 2004 ; ida & lin 2005 ; kennedy & kenyon 2008 although see kornet & wolf 2006 ) , and observational estimates support this picture ( butler et al .  2004b ;",
    "butler et al .",
    "2006b ; endl et al .",
    "2006 ; johnson et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "these interpretations are complicated by the fact that the mass - period distribution is subject to selection effects at low masses and long orbital periods .",
    "the important observational quantity is the stellar velocity amplitude induced by the planet , which for a planet of mass @xmath27 is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the orbital period , @xmath30 is the eccentricity , @xmath31 is the mass of the star , and @xmath32 is the inclination of the orbit .",
    "the dotted lines in figure [ fig : mp ] show @xmath33 and @xmath34 for circular orbits around a solar mass star .",
    "the detectable amplitude depends on the number and duration of the observations , and particularly on the doppler measurement errors and other noise sources ( see cumming 2004 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "scatter in the measured radial velocity is expected from statistical and systematic measurement errors , and intrinsic stellar radial velocity variations or `` jitter '' .",
    "the typical statistical measurement error , which we refer to in this paper as the `` doppler error '' or `` doppler measurement error '' , is determined by the uncertainty in the mean velocity of a large number of spectral segments .",
    "the doppler errors are typically @xmath35@xmath36 in the data considered here , although doppler errors as small as @xmath37 are now routine ( mayor et al .  2003 ; butler et al .",
    "sources of systematic measurement errors include imperfect psf descriptions and deconvolution algorithms , and the characterization of the charge transfer in the spectrometer ccd ( see discussion in butler et al .",
    "stellar jitter is thought to arise from a combination of surface convective motions , magnetic activity , and rotation ( saar & donahue 1997 ) .",
    "the amount of jitter depends on stellar properties such as rotation rate and spectral type , but is typically @xmath38@xmath36 for chromospherically quiet stars ( saar , butler , & marcy 1998 ; santos et al .",
    "2000 ; wright 2005 ) .",
    "additional low mass planets in a system could provide another source of radial velocity variability .",
    "these various sources of noise determine the velocity threshold for detecting planets , and vary between observations , different stars , and different surveys .",
    "interpretation of the mass - period distribution at low masses requires a careful analysis of these selection effects .",
    "most work to date has taken a fixed detection threshold , such as @xmath39 ( e.g.  udry et al .",
    "2003 ) or a mass cut well above the masses at which selection effects should play a role ( lineweaver & grether 2003 ) .",
    "a few detailed calculations of detection thresholds have been carried out . in cumming ,",
    "marcy , & butler ( 1999 ) , we presented an analysis of 11 years of doppler measurements of 76 stars as part of the lick planet search",
    ". however , the conclusions regarding the mass - period distribution were limited because only 6 planets were then known .",

    "( 2002 ) present a statistical analysis of the 37 star sample observed by the eso coud echelle spectrometer .",
    "wittenmyer et al .  ( 2006 ) present limits on companion mass for 31 stars observed at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the largest study so far is that of naef et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who derive detection thresholds for 330 stars from the elodie planet search and estimate planet occurrence rates .    in this paper",
    ", we analyse 8 years of radial velocity measurements from the keck survey , consisting of data taken from the beginning of the survey in 1996 to the time of the hires spectrometer upgrade in 2004 august .",
    "the number of stars ( @xmath40 ) and planets ( @xmath41 ) included in the sample offer an order of magnitude improvement over our previous cumming et al .",
    "( 1999 ) analysis , and therefore the best opportunity to date to determine the occurrence rate of planets and their mass - period distribution .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe a technique for identifying planets in radial velocity data , discuss the detection thresholds for the survey , and calculate limits on the mass and period of planets orbiting stars that do not have a significant detection . in  3 , we use these limits to correct the mass and period distributions for incompleteness , and then characterize the occurrence rate of planets and the mass - period distribution . we summarize and conclude in  4 .",
    "the keck planet search program has been in operation since 1996 july , using the hires echelle spectrometer on the keck i telescope ( vogt et al .  1994 ; vogt et al .",
    "the data we analyze here were taken from the beginning of the survey up to 2004 august when the hires spectrometer was upgraded .",
    "they consist of radial velocity measurements of 585 f , g , k , and m stars ( the fractions in these spectral classes are 7 , 49 , 27 , and 16% respectively ) .",
    "note that the m dwarf sample covers spectral types m5 and earlier ; the f stars are of spectral type f5 and later .",
    "selection of the target stars is described in wright et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and marcy et al .",
    "( 2005b ) .",
    "they lie close to the main sequence and are chromospherically quiet .",
    "they have @xmath42 , declination @xmath43 , and have no stellar companion within 2 \" . to ensure enough data points for an adequate keplerian fit to the data , we further select only those stars with at least 10 observations over a period of two years or more .",
    "this excludes data for an additional 360 stars that were added in the two years prior to 2004 august .",
    "figure [ fig : obs1 ] is a summary of the number , time baseline or duration , and mean rate of observations .",
    "typical values are @xmath44@xmath45 observations in total over a duration of @xmath46@xmath47 years , with 3 observations per year . the target list of stars has changed over the years of the survey , with stars being dropped and added ( see marcy et al .",
    "2005b for a discussion of the evolution of the target list ) , resulting in the spread in durations shown in figure [ fig : obs1 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : obs2 ] is a summary of the statistical doppler measurement errors and the estimated jitter from wright ( 2005 ) .",
    "the doppler error shown is the mean doppler error for all observations for each star .",
    "these are statistical errors determined by the weighted uncertainty in the mean velocity of 400 spectral segments , each 2  long .",
    "most stars have a mean doppler measurement error of @xmath48 ( smaller errors of @xmath49 have been achieved at keck following the 2004 hires upgrade , but these data are not included in this analysis ) .",
    "the stars in the sample have been selected to be chromospherically inactive , but still show stellar jitter at the few @xmath50 level ( saar et al .",
    "we adopt the jitter estimates described in marcy et al .",
    "( 2005b ) and wright ( 2005 ) , in which the level of jitter is calibrated in terms of stellar properties , in particular @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "these values include contributions from both intrinsic stellar jitter and systematic measurement errors .",
    "the typical jitter is @xmath54 for a chromospherically quiet star , with a tail of larger values for more active stars .",
    "this is comparable to the doppler measurement errors , indicating that the velocity measurements have reached a precision for which stellar jitter and systematic errors are beginning to dominate the uncertainty .    in figures [ fig : obs1 ] and [ fig : obs2 ]",
    "the dotted histograms summarize the observations of the 110 stars with stellar masses @xmath55 , which are almost entirely m dwarfs . in  [ sec : mp ] , we analyze the mass - orbital period distribution separately for stars with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , since the planet occurrence rate for m dwarfs appears to be smaller than that for fgk stars . figures [ fig : obs1 ] and [ fig : obs2 ] show that in general the doppler errors for the m dwarfs are larger than for the fgk stars , mostly due to their relative faintness .",
    "the dashed histograms in figures [ fig : obs1 ] are for the subset of stars with an announced planet ( see  2.4 ) . once a candidate planetary signature is detected in the data , we increase the priority of that star in our observing schedule , resulting in a greater number of observations for those stars with announced planets .",
    "we include the doppler errors and jitter by adding them in quadrature to find a total estimated error for each data point @xmath32 , @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ fig : normres ] shows the distribution of the residuals after subtracting the mean velocity for a set of 386 `` quiet '' stars which after a preliminary analysis show no excess variability , long term trend , or evidence for a periodicity .",
    "we plot a histogram of the ratio @xmath59 for all 3436 velocities for these stars , compared with a normal distribution .",
    "the width of the observed distribution is @xmath60% greater than a unit variance gaussian , suggesting that the estimated variability is underpredicted by this factor . to allow for this",
    ", we have multiplied each @xmath61 by a factor of 1.3 in the analysis that follows .",
    "the dotted histogram shows a normal distribution with @xmath62 for comparison with the observed distribution .",
    "the gaussian distribution underpredicts the tails of the distribution somewhat , but otherwise agrees quite well .",
    "the magnitude of this correction has only a small effect on the results of this paper , because when assessing the significance of a keplerian orbit fit , we calculate ratios of chi - squared ( for example , the ratio of chi - squareds with and without the keplerian orbit included in the model ) and so the role of the errors @xmath61 is to set the relative weighting of different data points ( see cumming et al .",
    "1999 for a discussion ) .",
    "the first indication of a companion is often excess velocity variability above the level expected from measurement errors and stellar jitter . to assess this",
    ", we fit a straight line to each data set , and compare the observed scatter about the straight line to the predicted value .",
    "the data for each star are a set of measured velocities @xmath63 , observation times @xmath64 , and estimated errors @xmath65 .",
    "the estimated error @xmath61 is the quadrature sum of the doppler error and stellar jitter , as described in  2.1 .",
    "we fit either a constant ( @xmath66 ) or a straight line ( @xmath67 ) to the data . to test whether including a slope",
    "significantly improves the chi - squared of the fit , @xmath68 we use an f - test ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) .",
    "the appropriate f - statistic is @xmath69 ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) , where @xmath70 is the @xmath71 for the best - fitting constant , and @xmath72 is the @xmath71 for the best - fitting straight line .",
    "we determine the probability that the observed value of @xmath73 is drawn from the corresponding @xmath74-distribution .",
    "if this probability is smaller than @xmath75% , we conclude that the slope is significant .",
    "we make the choice of @xmath75% so that we expect no false detections in our sample of 585 stars .",
    "we find that 95 stars ( 16% of the total ) have a significant slope .",
    "this fraction is consistent with the 20 out of 76 stars in the lick sample , or 26% , that showed a long - term trend at the 0.1% significance level ( cumming et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "having decided whether a constant or a straight line best describes the long term behavior , we then test whether the residuals to the fit are consistent with the expected variability .",
    "we calculate the probability that @xmath70 or @xmath72 is drawn from a chi - squared distribution with @xmath76 or @xmath77 degrees of freedom respectively ( hoel , port , & stone 1971 ) .",
    "we again choose a 0.1% threshold , so if this probability is smaller than 0.1% we infer that there is excess variability in the data .",
    "we find that of the 585 stars , 131 show significant variability at the 0.1% level , or 23% of the total .",
    "of these 131 stars , 34 ( 26% ) also show a significant slope ( i.e.  6% of the 585 stars show both significant variability and a significant slope ) .",
    "this is similar to the lick survey results , where we found 17 out of 76 stars , or 22% , with excess variability ( cumming et al .",
    "1999 ; see also nidever et al .",
    "2002 who found that 107 out of 889 stars showed velocity variations of more than @xmath78 over 4 years ) .      to search for the signature of an orbiting planet",
    ", we fit keplerian orbits to the radial velocities , and assess the significance of the fit ( cumming 2004 , hereafter c04 ; marcy et al .  2005b ; otoole et al .",
    "the non - linear least - squares fit of a keplerian orbit requires a good initial guess for the best - fitting parameters since there are many local minima in the @xmath71 space .",
    "our approach is to first limit the fit to circular orbits , and use the best - fitting circular orbit parameters as a starting point for a full keplerian fit .",
    "it is important to note here that we search only for a single planet .",
    "we do not consider multiple planet systems in this paper , therefore our results for the mass and orbital period distributions apply only to the planet with the highest doppler amplitude in a given system . to be consistent in this approach",
    ", we do not include any long term trends detected in  2.2 in the planet fits , and compare only to a constant velocity when assessing the significance of a given keplerian fit .",
    "a star with a significant long - term trend will therefore be flagged as having a significant keplerian fit with orbital period much longer than the duration of the observations .",
    "the multiplicity of planets as a function of their orbital periods is an important question that we leave to future work .    to find the best - fitting circular orbit ,",
    "we calculate the lomb - scargle ( ls ) periodogram ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) for each data set .",
    "this involves fitting a sinusoid plus constant to the data for a range of trial orbital periods @xmath29 . for each period",
    ", the goodness of fit is indicated by the amount by which including a sinusoid in the fit lowers @xmath71 compared to a model in which the velocity is constant in time .",
    "this is measured by the periodogram power @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the @xmath71 of a fit of a constant to the data , @xmath81 is the @xmath71 of the circular orbit fit , @xmath82 is the mean velocity , @xmath83 is the trial orbital frequency , and @xmath84 the best - fitting frequency .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom in the sinusoid fit is @xmath85 .",
    "a large power @xmath86 indicates that including a sinusoid significantly decreased the @xmath71 of the fit .",
    "we consider trial orbital periods between 1 day and 30 years .",
    "we next choose two best fitting solutions as starting points for a full non - linear keplerian fit .",
    "the two sinusoids are chosen so that they are well - separated in frequency .",
    "we then use a levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) to search for the minimum @xmath71 , starting with a keplerian orbit with the same period and amplitude as the sinusoid fits , and trying several different choices for the time of periastron , eccentricity , and longitude of pericenter .",
    "having obtained the minimum @xmath71 from the keplerian fit , we define a power @xmath87 to measure the goodness of fit analogous to the ls periodogram power for circular orbits , @xmath88 ( c04 ) , where @xmath89 is the @xmath71 of a fit of a keplerian orbit to the data ( with @xmath90 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the significance of the fit depends on how often a power as large as the observed power @xmath91 would arise purely due to noise alone ( c04 ; marcy et al .",
    "for a single frequency search , the distribution of powers due to noise alone can be written down analytically for gaussian noise , it is @xmath92 ( c04 ) , where @xmath93 . however , the total false alarm probability depends on how many independent frequencies are searched . for a search of many frequencies , each independent frequency must be counted as an individual trial .",
    "the false alarm probability ( fap ) is @xmath94^{n_f}\\approx n_f\\ { \\rm prob}(z > z_0),\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the number of independent frequencies , and in the second step we assume @xmath74 is small . for small @xmath74 ,",
    "the fap is simply the single frequency fap multiplied by the number of frequencies .",
    "an estimate of the number of independent frequencies is @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the frequency range searched and @xmath98 is the duration of the data set ( c04 ) . for evenly - sampled data ,",
    "the number of independent frequencies is @xmath99 , ranging from @xmath100 to the nyquist frequency @xmath101 .",
    "for unevenly - sampled data , horne & baliunas ( 1986 ) found that @xmath102 for a search up to the nyquist frequency ( see also press et al .",
    "this agrees with our simple estimate since @xmath103",
    ". however , uneven sampling allows frequencies much higher than the nyquist frequency to be searched ( see discussion in scargle 1982 ) . in general , @xmath104 , by a factor of @xmath105 .",
    "for example , a set of 30 observations over 7 years has @xmath106 .",
    "a search for periods as short as 2 days therefore has @xmath107 . therefore to detect a signal with a fap of @xmath108 , the periodogram power for",
    "that signal must be large enough , or the keplerian fit good enough , that the single - trial false alarm probability is @xmath109 .",
    "the estimate for @xmath95 and equations ( [ eq : keplerprob ] ) and ( [ eq : fa ] ) allow an analytic calculation of the false alarm probability ( see fig .  2 of c04 ) .",
    "to check this analytic estimate , we determine the fap and @xmath95 numerically using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the disadvantage of calculating the fap in this way is that it is computationally intensive for keplerian fits .",
    "this is the reason why we consider only the two best - fitting sinusoid models as starting points for the keplerian fit .",
    "we find that the analytic estimate of the fap agrees well with the fap determined by the monte carlo simulations .",
    "our method is to generate a large number @xmath110 of data sets consisting of noise only , using the same observation times as the data , and calculate the maximum power for each of them .",
    "the fraction of trials for which the maximum power exceeds the observed value then gives the false alarm probability .",
    "in addition , by fitting equation ( [ eq : fa ] ) to the numerical results , we can determine @xmath95 .",
    "this allows a determination of the fap even when it is much smaller than @xmath111 ( c04 ) .",
    "we generate the noise in two ways , which give similar results for the fap ( see cumming et al .",
    "1999 ) : ( i ) by selecting from a gaussian distribution with standard deviation given by the observed error @xmath61 for each observation time , or ( ii ) by selecting with replacement from the observed velocities ( after first subtracting the mean ) .",
    "the second approach ( a `` bootstrapping '' method , see press et al .",
    "1992 ) has the advantage that it avoids the assumption of gaussian noise ; instead the actual velocity values are used as an estimate of the noise distribution .",
    "it is similar to the `` velocity scrambling '' method of marcy et al .",
    "( 2005b ) for determining the false alarm probability for keplerian fits , with the main difference being that we select with replacement from the observed velocities rather than randomizing the order of the observations .",
    "figure [ fig : keck2 ] shows the results of the search for significant keplerian fits .",
    "we plot the best - fit amplitude and period for stars with fap@xmath112% , divided into two categories .",
    "the open circles are for stars with an announced planet ( i.e. a published orbital solution ) as of 2005 may ; the solid triangles are stars with a significant keplerian fit , but not confirmed as a planet",
    ". we will refer to these significant detections that are not announced as planets as `` candidate '' planets .",
    "there are 48 announced planets detected in our search ( 8.2% of the total number of stars ) , and 76 candidates ( 13% of the total ) .",
    "all but five of the announced planets in our sample of stars were detected by our algorithm ( the 5 planets that were not detected orbit stars that were added to the survey only recently to confirm detections by other groups , see discussion below ) .",
    "of the 76 candidates , 27 have large velocity amplitudes @xmath113 corresponding to companion masses @xmath114 .",
    "the remaining 49 candidates , which have @xmath115 , fall into two groups : they are either at long orbital periods ( @xmath116 days ) , or low amplitudes ( @xmath117@xmath118 ) compared with the announced planets . that these are the detections that have not yet been announced makes sense since ( i ) it is difficult to constrain orbital parameters for a partial orbit , and so we generally wait for completion of at least one full orbit before announcing a planet , and ( ii ) for low amplitude signals , it becomes difficult to disentangle possible false signals from stellar photospheric jitter or from systematic variations in the measured velocities .    in the first case ( long orbital periods ) , it is simple to understand the detection limit , which is set by the time baseline of the observations . the vertical dashed line in figure [ fig : keck2 ] shows an orbital period of @xmath47 years ( the duration of the longest data set considered here ) , and nicely divides the announced and candidate planets . in the second case ( low amplitudes ) , an interesting question to consider is how the threshold for announcing a planet relates to the statistical threshold for detecting a keplerian orbit .",
    "the statistical detection threshold depends on both the number of observations and signal amplitude . for circular orbits , an analytic expression for the signal to noise required to detect a signal with 50% probability",
    "is given by @xmath119^{1/2}\\ ] ] ( cumming et al .",
    "2003 ; c04 ) , where @xmath74 is the false alarm probability associated with the detection threshold , @xmath95 is the number of independent frequencies , @xmath120 is the noise level , and @xmath121 .",
    "the number of independent frequencies @xmath95 is set by the number of observations @xmath122 and the duration of the observations @xmath98 , as we discussed in  2.3 .",

    ", we define the noise @xmath120 to be the rms amplitude of the residuals to the best fit orbit , and the signal to noise ratio as @xmath123 .",
    "we show only those detections with best fitting period @xmath124 days and mass @xmath125 , for which signal to noise is expected to be the main limiting factor .",
    "the dotted curves show the analytic result for a detection probability of 50% and 99% .",
    "the candidate detections mostly fall near the detection curves in figure [ fig : sn ] , whereas the announced planets lie above the curves .",
    "the five crosses represent planets that were detected by other groups .",
    "their host stars , hd  8574 , hd  74156 , hd  82943 , hd  130322 , and hd  169830 , were added to the keck survey to confirm these detections , but do not yet have enough observations for a detection .",
    "they all lie below the dotted curves .    inspection of figure [ fig : sn ] shows that the detection threshold is determined by statistics when the signal to noise ratio is larger than @xmath13@xmath35 . for lower amplitude signals , the statistical significance is no longer enough , since as we mentioned there is the danger that the observed variation is in fact from stellar jitter or systematic effects .",
    "figure [ fig : sn ] shows that the effective detection threshold is then at a signal to noise of @xmath126 . to detect a planet with a lower amplitude than this requires significantly more work to rule out false signals .",
    "comparison with the published orbits shows that our automated technique reproduces the fitted orbital parameters well , except for 2 of the 48 announced planets . for hd  50499",
    ", we find an orbital period of @xmath127 days rather than 3000 days .",
    "we include a slope in the fit for this star , which reproduces the published orbital parameters .",
    "we find a period of 15 rather than 111 days for the highly eccentric planet around hd  80606 ( which has @xmath128 ; naef et al .",
    "these examples illustrate the weakness of the lomb - scargle periodogram at providing a good initial guess for the keplerian fit , in particular for eccentric orbits , and emphasises the importance of trying many different starting periods .",
    "there are also strong aliasing or spectral leakage effects at 1 day , and so when fitting keplerian orbits , we force the orbital period to be longer than 1.2 days rather than the 1 day limit of our periodogram search",
    ". we might also expect the search to fail for multiple planet systems ; however , in all cases of announced multiple planet systems , we find a significiant single planet fit , usually for the planet with the largest velocity amplitude .",
    "this is the case even when the periods are close to or are harmonically related .",
    "for example , hd  128311 has two planets in a 2:1 resonance ( vogt et al .",
    "we detect the longer period planet in our search .",

    "( 1980 ) which describes the 1-dimensional case .",
    "it is instructive to consider a hypothetical example to develop some intuition .",
    "imagine that after looking at a given star there were three possible outcomes : we either ( i ) detect a planet , ( ii ) completely exclude the presence of a planet , or ( iii ) are not able to say anything ( i.e.  can not exclude or confirm the presence of a planet ) .",
    "first , we observe @xmath168 stars with the result that @xmath169 planets are found and we are able to rule out planets from all of the remaining stars .",

    "however , what if we are able to rule out planets only from a subset of stars , @xmath171 ? in this case , the best estimate of the planet fraction is to take the ratio of the number of detections to the number of stars for which a detection was possible , @xmath172 .",
    "we must take @xmath173 as the denominator because for each detected planet , the actual pool of target stars is less than the total pool , because the data for some of the stars are inadequate to detect that planet . as an extreme case , consider looking at 100 stars , and being able to say that one has a planet , one does not , and nothing about the remaining 98 stars ( @xmath174 and @xmath175 ) .",
    "the best estimate for the planet fraction is then 50% .",
    "the extra 98 stars for which no useful upper limit could be obtained do not contribute to the estimate .",
    "this simple example tells us how to interpret figure 8 . in a region of the mass - period plane in which planets can be ruled out for a fraction @xmath176 of stars ,",
    "the best estimate of the number of planets is @xmath177 times the number of detections .    our approach is to assign an effective number @xmath178 for each detected planet @xmath32 .",
    "if selection effects are unimportant , @xmath179 , so that the detected planet is a good representation of the number of planets at that mass and period",
    ". however , @xmath178 will be greater than 1 if planet @xmath32 has orbital parameters in part of the mass - period plane where completeness corrections are important .",
    "for instance , if the completeness for planets at a given mass and period is 50% , then @xmath178 for a planet @xmath32 at that mass and period will be 2 .",
    "the idea behind this method is that we are sampling the mass and period distribution at the discrete set of points corresponding to the mass and periods of the detected planets .",
    "of course , the underlying distribution is likely to be smooth , and so the quantity @xmath180 should be thought of as the probability that a star has a planet with mass and period close to those of planet @xmath32 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath178 is such that the total fraction of stars with planets is @xmath181 .    to calculate @xmath178 for a given star with a detected planet",

    "we therefore consider each non - detection in turn and ask whether the upper limit @xmath182 calculated in  2.5 allows a companion with period @xmath183 and @xmath184 to be present .",
    "if so , we must increase @xmath178 to allow for this incompleteness .",
    "however , the upper limit @xmath182 allows a hypothetical planet to be present with _ any _ amplitude or orbital period that satisfies @xmath185 , not just the orbital parameters of planet @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , rather than increasing @xmath178 by 1 for every upper limit that allows additional undiscovered planets at that location , we must increase @xmath178 by the probability that the hypothetical planet would have the same parameters as planet @xmath32 .",
    "in effect , we `` share out '' the hypothetical planet amongst all the possible locations in mass period space that are allowed by the upper limit .",

    "a similar uncertainty applies for our extrapolation to long orbital periods also , since for example the relevant timescales for planet formation grow longer at larger orbital radii , although outwards migration can populate long period orbits ( veras & armitage 2004 ; martin et al .  2007 ) .",

    ". however , this result depends on several candidate detections with @xmath329 in this period range that await confirmation .",
    "a dependence of the mass function on orbital period might indicate differences in migration mechanisms for different planet masses ( armitage 2007 ) .",
    "the orbital period distribution shows an increase in the occurrence rate of gas giants of a factor of 5 beyond @xmath330 days .",
    "theoretical models of planet formation generally predict a smooth increase in the incidence of gas giants at longer orbital periods due to the increasing rate of migration as a planet moves inwards through the protoplanetary disk ( e.g.  figure 1 of ida & lin 2004b ; figure 5 of armitage 2007 ) .",
    "the sharp increase in the period distribution at @xmath330 days shown in figure 11 may reflect some particular radial structure in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "ida & lin ( 2008b ) propose an explanation for this upturn based on a surface density enhancement at the ice line due to a local pressure maximum in the disk .",
    "detailed comparisons between these various models and our results would constrain parameters such as the ratio of migration to disk depletion timescales ( e.g.  ida & lin 2004 ; armitage 2007 ) .",

    "[ fig : avni5 ] ) , with a two sigma limit @xmath332 . a lower incidence of jupiter mass planets around m dwarfs is predicted by core accretion models for planet formation ( laughlin , bodenheimer , & adams 2004 ; ida & lin 2005 ; kornet & wolf 2006 ; kennedy & kenyon 2008 ) . comparing with figure 8 of ida & lin ( 2005 )",

    "their figure 7 shows that the probability of having at least one giant planet is @xmath46 times lower for @xmath335 star than a @xmath336 star , within the range found in this paper .",
    "we can rule out a larger gas giant planet fraction for m dwarfs than for solar mass stars , as found by kornet & wolf ( 2006 ) for models in which the disk parameters were independent of stellar mass .",
    "our calculations can be improved in several respects .",
    "first , we neglected eccentricity when accounting for non - detections .",
    "this is reasonable for most values of @xmath30 , since eccentricity has a large effect on detectability for @xmath337 ( endl et al .",
    "2002 ; c04 ) .",
    "however , the population of high eccentricity planets ( @xmath132 ) is not well constrained . in addition",
    ", there are more subtle selection effects involving eccentricity .",
    "for example , cumming ( 2004 ) showed that non - zero eccentricity enhances detectability for orbital periods longer than the time baseline of the data , introducing a bias in the longest period orbits towards systems with @xmath338 .",
    "further analysis is required to study the eccentricity distribution and the orbital period distribution of long period planets .",
    "our data potentially allow us constrain the distribution of orbital periods beyond the 8 year time baseline of the observations , but this will require averaging over the range of possible eccentricities for those outer planets . we did not include multiple planet systems .",
    "this introduces some uncertainty in our derived distributions , since our technique identifies only a single planet . in a multiple system , this is the planet with the largest velocity amplitude , so that the distributions derived here are for the most detectable planet in a system .",
    "finally , our method for including the upper limits involves dividing the data into either detections or non - detections , which depends on the choice of detection threshold",
    ". a better approach would be to calculate the probabilities directly and include them in the analysis ( see eq .  [ [ eq : app1 ] ] ) .",

    "2006 for a clear discussion ) .    in this paper , rather than evaluate @xmath347 and @xmath344 directly , we have classified each data set as either a detection or a non - detection . in the case of a detection",
    ", we make the approximation @xmath348 since we expect the likelihood to be strongly peaked near the best fit mass and period for a strong detection , with a vanishing probability that no planet is present .",
    "we write the mass , period , and velocity amplitude of detection @xmath32 as @xmath349 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 . for a non - detection",
    ", we expect @xmath350 since we are able to rule out velocity amplitudes above the upper limit @xmath351 but not below it , and it remains possible that the star has no planet .",
    "substituting these approximations into equation ( [ eq : app1 ] ) gives @xmath352 where we have used the normalization @xmath341 .",
    "the total likelihood is @xmath353 where @xmath354 is the number of detections out of @xmath168 stars .",
    "equation ( [ eq : like ] ) is a two - dimensional generalization of the likelihood function of avni et al .",
    "( 1980 ) .    as a quick aside to gain some intuition , let s assume that @xmath340 is a constant independent of @xmath209 and @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , assume that @xmath182 is the same for each star with a non - detection .",
    "then , @xmath355 where @xmath176 is the fraction of planets ruled out by the upper limit . to find the best fit value of @xmath339 , we maximize @xmath356 by setting @xmath357 .",
    "this gives @xmath358 if the upper limit rules out the whole mass - period plane ( in other words we can say that a star without a detection definitely does not have a planet ) then @xmath359 and @xmath360 .",
    "however , if @xmath361 then we can exclude only a fraction @xmath176 of planets , and our estimate of @xmath339 must therefore be larger .",
    "for example , if a third of planets lie above the upper limit ( @xmath362 ) , we conclude that there are three times as many planets as we actually detect , @xmath363 .      to proceed further , one could divide the mass - period plane into a grid and solve for @xmath340 in each grid cell ( a non - parametric approach ) , or assume a parametric form for @xmath340 and find the parameters that maximize the likelihood .",
    "we follow avni et al .",
    "vb ) which is to discretize @xmath364 at the locations of the detected planets , i.e.  write @xmath365 , where we use the shorthand @xmath366 , the sum is over the detections , and the normalization is @xmath367 .",
    "this method gives @xmath340 in a non - parametric way , but without binning the distribution .",
    "the total log likelihood is @xmath368,\\ ] ] where the sums with index @xmath32 are over detections and the sum with index @xmath188 is over all non - detections .",
    "we can now go ahead and maximize @xmath356 with respect to the @xmath354 values of @xmath369 .",
    "we set @xmath370 , which gives @xmath371^{-1},\\ ] ] where the sum with index @xmath188 is over all non - detections with upper limits that exclude a companion with the amplitude of detection @xmath32 , and we define @xmath372 which has a sum over all detections that have velocity amplitudes larger than the specified upper limit @xmath182 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : iterate1 ] ) is an equation for @xmath369 which can be solved iteratively , as in  [ sec : avni ] .",
    "however , we proceed a little further in order to make connection with the heuristic derivation given in  [ sec : avni ] . we write equation ( [ eq : iterate1 ] ) as @xmath373 and",
    "then sum both sides over the detections , from @xmath374 to @xmath375 .",
    "after changing the order of the sums on the right hand side and simplifying , we find the result @xmath376 where the sum @xmath188 is over all non - detections .",
    "using this to rewrite equation ( [ eq : iterate1 ] ) , we find @xmath377 where the sum is over all non - detections @xmath188 which have upper limits that allow a companion with the same amplitude as detection @xmath32 to be present . equation ( [ eq : iterate2 ] ) is therefore equivalent to equation ( [ eq : iterate1 ] ) , and with the final definition @xmath378 , reduces to equation ( [ eq : iterate ] ) of  [ sec : avni ] when solved iteratively .",
    "one might worry that by following the distribution @xmath340 only at the location of the detected planets , we are missing those areas of the mass - period plane in which there are no detections .",
    "in fact , we show now that the converged solution has non - zero values for @xmath364 only at the locations of the detected planets . we start with equation ( [ eq : like ] ) and",
    "divide the mass - period plane into grid cells , labelled by @xmath211 so that we will write @xmath340 averaged over grid cell @xmath211 as @xmath379 . the grid cell containing detection @xmath32 we write as @xmath380 .",
    "the likelihood is then given by @xmath381.\\ ] ] in the last term , @xmath382 is the velocity amplitude associated with grid cell @xmath211 , and so the sum is over only those grid cells that are constrained by the upper limit @xmath188 .",
    "we assume that the grid cells are small enough that the entire grid cell is either excluded or allowed by the upper limit ; in practice only a part of the grid cell may be excluded by the upper limit , but we ignore this here for clarity .",
    "now , maximizing @xmath383 with respect to the set of @xmath379 by setting @xmath384 , we find @xmath385^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath386 is the number of detections in grid cell @xmath211 and @xmath387 .",
    "following the same steps as in our derivation of equation ( [ eq : iterate2 ] ) , we rewrite this as an iterative procedure , @xmath388 which should be compared with equation ( [ eq : iterate2 ] ) . now subtracting @xmath389 from both sides ,",
    "we find @xmath390 where we use a result analogous to equation ( [ eq : app2 ] ) .",
    "we see that the converged solution ( @xmath391 ) is @xmath392^{-1}.\\ ] ] therefore , the converged solution has @xmath379 non - zero only in those grid cells which have detections ( @xmath393 ) . taking bins small enough to contain either one or zero planets",
    ", we see that we need evaluate @xmath364 only at the locations of the detected planets , which is our starting point for equation ( [ eq : like2 ] ) ( see also ",
    "v.b of avni et al .",
    "1980 , who show that a solution of eq .",
    "[ [ eq : like ] ] can be derived which is a sum over delta functions evaluated at the detected points ) .",
    "we now derive the likelihood @xmath356 for an assumed power law distribution @xmath394 , where @xmath10 is a normalization constant .",
    "this is used in ",
    "[ sec : mp ] to derive the best - fitting values of @xmath211 and @xmath212 by maximizing @xmath356 with respect to these parameters .",
    "the calculation here is very similar to tabachnik & tremaine ( 2002 ) except for our different form for @xmath356 ( see discussion following eq .  [ [ eq : app1 ] ] ) .",
    "the log likelihood is @xmath395\\ ] ] where @xmath396 setting @xmath397 gives the relation @xmath398 which can be solved to determine @xmath10 for given @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "we calculate the integrals @xmath399 numerically , taking into account the variation of the upper limit @xmath182 with orbital period .",
    "following tabachnik & tremaine ( 2002 ) , after choosing the range of @xmath400 and @xmath246 we are interested in , we refine it to just cover the range of periods and masses of the detected planets , as this maximizes the likelihood",
    ".    in  [ sec : mdwarfs ] , we divide the stars into two groups based on their mass , and , assuming fixed values of @xmath211 and @xmath212 , fit separately for the two normalizations @xmath401 and @xmath402 , where @xmath364 is the relative planet fraction of group 1 ( stellar masses @xmath403 ) compared with group 2 ( stellar masses @xmath404 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that in this case , @xmath10 and @xmath364 are determined by solving @xmath405 where @xmath406 or @xmath407 indicates a sum over the non - detections in group 1 or 2 respectively , and @xmath408 and @xmath409 are the number of detections in groups 1 and 2 .    to get a feel for the solution",
    ", it is helpful to solve equation ( [ eq : appc ] ) for the constant @xmath10 in the approximation that the integrals @xmath410 are the same constant for all stars with non - detections .",
    "this gives @xmath411 the last term counts the number of constraining observations , analogous to the factor @xmath176 in equation ( [ eq : intu ] ) . in the case where we divide the stars into two groups , the ratio of normalizations that maximizes the likelihood is @xmath412 the factor @xmath413 accounts for the relative detectability of planets in group 1 or 2 . if detectability is the same for the two groups of stars , @xmath414 , the estimate for @xmath415 corresponds to simply counting the relative fractions of detections .",
