    "the advent of modern database technology has greatly vitalized the statistical study of networks .",
    "the vastness of the available data sets makes this field apt for the techniques of statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "one particular example that has been extensively studied is the contact networks of individuals  @xcite .",
    "the vertices in this kind of networks are individuals and an edge between two people means that there has been a contact between these persons .",
    "typical data sets for this kind of networks are lists of messages through some electronic medium , like e - mails  @xcite or instant messenger applications  @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the times of the contacts may also be available , which makes the data set much more informative than the corresponding contact network .",
    "some studies of the temporal statistics of such data sets have been made  @xcite , but how the contact dynamics affect the picture from the network topology is yet , in many respects , obscure . in this paper",
    "we study some aspects of the temporal contact pattern in a the framework of networks : how fast can information , or disease , spread across an empirical contact network ? how much of the network can be reached from one vertex through a series of contacts ?",
    "these are properties that depends not only on the number of neighbors of a vertex , or the number of contacts along an edge , but also the time ordering of the contacts  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ill ] we give an illustration of such spreading processes .",
    "we call a network where information can spread between most pairs of vertices through a series of contacts , and where the spreading is comparatively fast , a network with high _ reachability_. we quantify and measure reachability for four data sets from e - mail exchange and contacts within an internet community .",
    "the results are analyzed by a systematic use of conditional uniform graph tests .",
    "the reachability scaling in the large - time limit is also discussed .",
    "we use the metaphor of information , or rumor , spreading , but the results applies to a range of dynamical processes .",
    "by a _ contact sequence _ we mean a set of ordered triples @xmath0 , where the triple is referred to as a _ contact _ from the vertex ( person ) @xmath1 to the vertex @xmath2 at time @xmath3 ( or along the edge @xmath4 at time @xmath3 ) . for simplicity",
    "we set the first time of @xmath5 to zero , so the times of @xmath5 belongs to the interval @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "we let @xmath7 denote number of contacts and @xmath8 the number of directed edges .",
    "the ( contact ) network is a set of @xmath9 vertices @xmath10 , together with a set of @xmath8 directed edges @xmath11 such that a pair @xmath4 of vertices is a member of @xmath11 if and only if there is a time @xmath3 such that @xmath12 .",
    "we let @xmath13 denote the degree of a vertex ( the number adjacent edges ) .",
    "since the edges are directed it is sensible to distinguish between in- and out - degree .",
    "we let @xmath14 denote the number of contacts along a particular edge . following ref .",
    "@xcite we call a list of contacts of increasing times a _ time respecting path_. just `` path '' will refer to a path , in general , in the contact network .",
    "we note that no other sets of contacts , other than time respecting paths , can transfer information , disease or commodity from one vertex to another in a contact sequence .",
    "we let @xmath15 denote the shortest time to reach @xmath2 starting from @xmath1 at time @xmath3 and @xmath16 denote the corresponding time - averaged quantity .",
    "one problem is that there is not always a time - respecting path from one vertex to another .",
    "we deal with this by both looking at the _ reachability time _",
    "@xmath17@xmath18 averaged over all pairs such that there exist a time - respecting path connecting them , and _",
    "reachability ratio _",
    "@xmath19the fraction of the vertex - pairs that does have a time respecting path between them .",
    "a way to characterize the network reachability with only one number would be to consider the harmonic mean of @xmath18 ( which is well - defined even if there are unreachable vertex - pairs ) .",
    "we do not do that since it is not a very intuitive quantity in that it is not the time - average of some actual process in the system .",
    "we use four real - world contact sequences all derived from communication over the internet .",
    "one of the data sets is based on contacts within the swedish internet community pussokram.com primarily intended for romantic interaction .",
    "@xcite in this data set the edges can represent messages of e - mail type , but they can also represent writing in guest books that are visible to the rest of the community .",

    "@xcite are constructed from log files of e - mail servers at two universities . in the ebel _",
    "_ data set a least one vertex of each contact is a student or employee of the university .",
    "the network of the outer vertices ( the ones not corresponding to a e - mail account hosted by the university ) is not mapped . for the eckmann _",
    "et al . _",
    "data no outer vertices are present .",
    "the fourth data set is constructed from the e - mail directories of 150 top executives of the enron corporation .",
    "this data set was released to public during the legal investigation concerning the enron corporation .",
    "( available at http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/  enron/. ) the contact sequence was constructed by parsing the e - mail headers and adding contacts from @xmath1 to @xmath2 if the address @xmath1 appears in the `` from '' field of the same e - mail where the address @xmath2 is present in the `` to '' field ( we do not include addresses in the `` cc '' and `` bcc '' fields ) . as a result",
    "this data set contains contacts between outer nodes , if the e - mail is from an outer vertex @xmath1 and some other recipient @xmath2 is also an outer vertex then there will be a contact from @xmath1 to @xmath2 in the contact sequence .",
    "the disadvantage of the enron data set , compared with the other e - mail data sets , is that some of the e - mails that really were sent to , or received by , the persons has been deleted , either by the individuals themselves or during the preparation of the data set for the sake of protecting privacy .",
    "the sizes of the data sets can be found in table .",
    "[ tab : size ] .",
    "the time resolution is one second for all data - sets .    to get a feeling for the data , we plot the average number of directed edges per vertex and the average number of contacts per directed edge in fig .  [",
    "fig : ncl ] .",
    "we note that the four data sets differ much , both in the actual values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the shape of the curves .",
    "we note that the enron curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : ncl](d ) are very flat for early and late sampling times , this is because quite few mails are dated to these intervals",
    ". it would be reasonable to preprocess the data by discarding the early and late enron e - mails , or removing the spam - mails causing the jagged appearance of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : ncl](b ) , but this would require a more detailed knowledge of the data .",
    "instead we simulate the data sets as they are and assume that the conclusions will be qualitatively correct due to the much larger amounts of good data .",
    "( some effects of strange communication will be discussed explicitly below . ) from fig .",
    "[ fig : ncl ] we can also conclude that all properties of contact sequences from computer mediated communication are not general  different settings of the data collection can record different contact patterns .",
    "this is nothing special for this kind of data , but it indicates that generalizations must be made with caution .",
    "the size of the data sets has consequences for how e.g.  @xmath17 is to be calculated in practice .",
    "if the data set is small , one can compute @xmath15 for each vertex - pair an every time occurring in @xmath5for any @xmath3 is not in @xmath5 we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the largest time in @xmath5 that is smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "our data sets are too large for such a procedure ( at the time of writing ) .",
    "instead we sample 100 times randomly over a interval @xmath24 $ ] and calculate @xmath15 for each vertex - pair . to use a @xmath25 less than one will give longer time respecting paths ( as time respecting paths originating from individuals only present in the end of the data set are omitted ) .",
    "since the fraction of @xmath26-paths will decrease with the sampling time , choice of @xmath25 matters less the larger the contact sequence is , and the choice of @xmath25 does not alter any qualitative conclusions .",
    "we use @xmath27 throughout the study .",
    "the actual calculation of @xmath15 can be done in @xmath28 time by initially marking @xmath1 by @xmath3 and every other vertex `` unvisited , '' then running through @xmath5 in the order of increasing times and for every triple @xmath29 marking @xmath2 with @xmath23 if and only if @xmath2 is marked `` unvisited '' and @xmath1 is marked with a time tag .",
    "to put the observed @xmath17 into perspective , and understand how it results from the temporal contact pattern and the network topology , we compare the measured values with values averaged over ensembles of randomized contact sequences in `` conditional uniform tests . ''",
    "@xcite . by systematically integrating ( or rather , averaging ) out different types of structure",
    "one can see how these types of structure are contributing to the measured result .",
    "for example , if we want to assess the impact of the order of the contacts we compare @xmath18 of @xmath5 with @xmath18 averaged over contact sequences with the times of @xmath5 randomly permuted .",
    "the five conditional uniform test ensembles we use , all having the same number of vertices , edges and number of contacts as @xmath5 , are the following :    permuted times ( pt ) : :    the set of contact sequences with the times randomly permuted ,    i.e.  the edges , and the number of occurrences of a particular edge in    @xmath5 is unchanged , as is the set of times , only the times    of the communication along a particular edge is randomized .",
    "random times ( rt ) : :    the ensemble with the same edges , and the same number of them as    @xmath5 , but the times are chosen uniformly randomly in the    same interval as the times of @xmath5 .",
    "random contacts ( rc ) : :    with the same set of edges as @xmath5 , but the numbers of    contacts per edges are chosen at random ( so it can be zero ) .",
    "the times    are chosen at random in @xmath5 s time span .",
    "randomized edges ( re ) : :    the ensemble of contact sequences with the same set of degrees as the    network generated by @xmath5 .",
    "the time list is the same as    @xmath5 , so that the @xmath30th contact of the    randomized sequence represents a contact between vertices of the same    degrees as in @xmath5 and occurs at the same time as the    @xmath30th contact of @xmath5 . all random ( ar )",
    ": :    the contacts are completely random , as are the times , only the sizes    @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and    @xmath31 are common to the original network .",
    "thus    the corresponding graph is a poisson random graph  @xcite .",
    "we note that the principles behind conditional uniform test are rather similar to those behind exponential random graph models .",
    "such models , as usual in statistical physics , are based on the assumption that when the constraints of a model are much fewer than the degrees of freedom , the best choice of model is the one that maximizes the entropy .",
    "@xcite the difference is that conditional uniform graph tests usually have @xmath26 constraints , whereas exponential random graphs typically have @xmath32 constraints .",
    "we sample 100 randomized contact sequences for each conditional uniform graph test .",

    "in this section we give , using conditional uniform tests , a thorough discussion about what structures of the data that govern the reachability . after that follows two short sections on the how the reachability is influenced by the traits of the start and finish vertex of a time - respecting path , and extrapolation of the results to the limit of large times .",
    "the values for @xmath17 and @xmath19 are given in table  [ tab : res ] and plotted against each other in fig .",
    "[ fig : scp ] .",
    "good network reachability means low values of @xmath17 and high values of @xmath19 .",
    "thus points in the the upper left corner of the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : scp ] represent high reachability , while the lower right corner mean low reachability . which of @xmath17 and @xmath19 that is the more important may vary : if one is interested of",
    "how soon information can reach a certain small number of people then @xmath17 is the more relevant . if one is interested of how many that eventually will receive the information , then @xmath17 is the more relevant .",
    "the actual values of @xmath17 and @xmath19 for the real - world data present few surprises .",
    "the largest @xmath19 is observed for the densest eckmann _",
    "et al . _  e - mail data , which is natural since the size of the largest connected component",
    "is known to increase with average degree .",
    "we also note that the sparsest data ( of ebel _ et al . _",
    ")   has the smallest @xmath19 . that the largest dataset , the enron data , has the largest @xmath17 and that the smallest data set ( of eckmann _ et al . _",
    ")   has the smallest @xmath17 is of course no surprise either .    for the conditional uniform tests we begin comparing the original networks with the one randomized according to the pt constraints .",
    "pt , only involving permuting the times of the contacts , is the test giving the smallest change to the original contact sequences .",
    "the reachability ratio of the rewired networks are consistently larger and the reachability time smaller .",
    "a natural explanation for this is that people tend to engage in dialog with each other @xcite for a while , thus the contacts along one edge tend to be clustered in time . for the reachability",
    "this means that the first contact of such a dialog will carry most of the time respecting paths .",
    "if the contacts are more evenly spread out in time ( the effect of the pt randomization ) the waiting time between the contacts will decrease and so will the reachability time . if the message exchange along particular edges would not be clustered in time the spread of information would thus probably be much faster .",
    "one may think of real world processes that increases the reachability  there may exist waves of large - scale message relaying , but apparently the dialog effect overshadows the impact of such events .",
    "already from this comparison we see that one looses much information from the contact sequence if one only consider the network it defines , no matter if the network is weighted  @xcite or not .",
    "the rt test generates slightly more randomized contact sequences than pt . in this case the times do not follow the daily routines of people  the probability of response after a certain time has peaks at multiples of days ( for e.g.  the data in ref .",
    "@xcite there is even a larger peak after one weak ) reflecting peoples daily ( and weekly ) routines  @xcite .",
    "as seen in table  [ tab : res ] the differences between the pt and rt randomizations are not very big .",
    "this is maybe not very surprising since the sampling time is much larger than the mentioned daily and weekly routines ( that gives a structure that is removed by rt , and could make a difference to pt ) .",
    "a structural bias that would favor reachability in the rt randomized sequences is that , in the real data , some edges , and vertices are created or ceased ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) during the sampling procedure which makes them inaccessible , in a time respecting sense , for early or late times respectively .",
    "evidently , this has no major impact on the reachability .    the rc randomization outputs contact sequences with yet less structural constraints than the rt scheme .",
    "as it turns out  see fig .  [",
    "fig : cldist]the distribution of contacts along a particular edge @xmath14 is skewed for all the data sets , with broad tails .",
    "this behavior was observed for scientific collaboration and airline networks in ref .",
    "@xcite , models of this behavior are given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "these broad tails are replaced by a poisson @xmath14-distribution for the rc randomized networks .",
    "the more frequent contacts along the edges having few contacts in reality increases the network reachability , both in terms of the reachability ratio and reachability time ( all rc points in fig .",
    "[ fig : scp ] lie above and to the left of the corresponding rt points )",
    ". a closer look at fig .",
    "[ fig : cldist ] shows that the largest @xmath14 values for some of the data sets are probably unrealistically big for a communication in the normal sense .",
    "some identical contacts are present in the ebel _",
    "et al . _",
    "data sets ( i.e.  e - mails with the same sender and recipient sent the same second ) these possibly comes from the same e - mail being addressed to the same receiver multiple times ) . if such multiple contacts were filtered away , the reachability would be unaltered for the real networks , but larger for the randomized networks ( since they would be denser in contacts ) .",
    "one can also argue that such events should be retained in some cases as spam ( and other one - to - many messages ) , in theory , can be read and spread information .",
    "we conclude that one needs to keep the presence of such abnormal edges in mind in the evaluation of contacts sequences .",

    "this approach , common for static networks  @xcite , results in unanimously longer reachability times , and smaller reachability ratios , than for rt .",
    "the structure lost by er randomization ( with respect to rt ) is the degree - degree correlations and clustering ( a heightened probability for short circuits ) .",
    "these networks have close to neutral degree - degree correlations  @xcite , and a slightly increased clustering compared to er randomized networks .",
    "one possible explanation for the lower er reachability is that the er randomization removes a positive @xmath14-correlation between adjacent edges . supposing the broad @xmath14 distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : cldist ] to some extent is due to some persons being more active communicators than others , it is likely that a large number of edges with many contacts lead to and from such an individual , thus creating such an correlation . that there really is a positive @xmath14-@xmath14-correlation for adjacent edges",
    "is shown in table  [ tab : llc ] .",
    "this positive correlation means that the passage , i.e.  a paths of length two ( a considerable distance since these are all small - world networks with very short average distances ) , through such a highly active communicator is very rapid .",
    "a perhaps even more significant correlation removed by re is the increased communication rates for edges connecting vertices of high degree .",
    "this is described for airline networks and networks of scientific collaborations in ref .",
    "@xcite but holds for our networks too , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lkk ] .",
    "since our networks are directed , we plot @xmath14 as a function of the out - degree of the from - vertex ( the edge s first argument ) and in - degree of the to - vertex ( the out - degree is related to the outward contact activity of the from - vertex and is therefore be the relevant degree ) .",
    "we see very high communication along edges connecting the vertices with highest degree for all our networks .",
    "( for the ebel",
    "_ et al . _  data in fig",
    "[ fig : lkk](b ) the highest @xmath14 value is so high , @xmath33 , that we truncate the plot to be able to see the rest of the structure , and to be able to compare with the other networks .",
    "this is probably related to the edges with unrealistically high communication rates discussed above . )",
    "edges between vertices of high degree are known to carry many shortest paths  @xcite , this correlation means that the shortest paths , in the real data sets , are possible to utilize in time respecting paths .",
    "clearly the removal of this structure by re randomization will decrease the reachability .",
    "the ar randomized networks are poisson random graphs with the same @xmath9 and @xmath8 as the original networks , and the @xmath7 contacts spread out with uniform probability over the same interval as the original contact sequences . for the three denser ( in @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) data sets , the pussokram.com , eckmann _ et al .",
    "_  and the enron data , the ar scheme gives the highest reachability ratio .",
    "for the very sparse ebel _",
    "et al . _",
    "data ar lower @xmath19 considerably .",
    "the effect must partly have a dynamic explanation as this data set is above the threshold for a giant strongly connected component ( @xmath34 )  @xcite .",
    "so far we have dealt with average reachability properties . in this section",
    "we will take a brief look on how the reachability depends on the characteristics of the individuals . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fkk ] we plot @xmath19 as a function of the out - degree @xmath35 of the first vertex of a time - respecting path and the in - degree @xmath36 of the last vertex of the path .",
    "the reason to look a the out - degree of the start vertex and the in - degree of the target vertex is similar as for the to- and from vertex in the context of fig .",
    "[ fig : lkk]these are the relevant degrees for the number of paths leading to and from the vertices .",
    "we see that for all data sets the @xmath19 for medium degree vertices is almost as high as for the vertices of highest degree , only the low degree vertices have significantly lower reachability ratios  on the other hand the low - degree vertices are , by far , the most frequent in the data sets .",
    "plots of @xmath17 against @xmath35 and @xmath36 give the same picture  reachability in this sense is also strictly increasing with the degree of the start- and target vertices .",
    "the picture emerging is that the contact sequences have a core @xcite of not only a very small diameter but also ( cf .",
    "[ fig : lkk ] ) very fast dynamics .      statistical physics traditionally deals with the limit of large size . in this section",
    "we discuss the relevance of this limit and how it can be studied through finite size scaling .",
    "an intuitive method is to average truncated intervals @xmath37\\subseteq [ t_\\mathrm{start},t_\\mathrm{stop}]$ ] of increasing length . in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv ] we plot @xmath17 for our four data sets as a function of the sampling time averaged over 100 intervals of every length .",
    "the curves are increasing with a convex shape , suggesting either a convergence to a non - zero value or a divergence towards infinity .",
    "we note that the @xmath38 limits of both @xmath17 and @xmath19 are non - trivial  there can of course be time respecting paths of the order of the sampling time , but the fraction of such long paths will decrease .",
    "thus the convexity of the @xmath39-curves is quite expected .",
    "there are many time - scales present in the data : above we mention days and weeks that separate recurring routines .",
    "the average duration of an edge was studied in ref .",
    "furthermore the average time between contacts per vertex , and the life - time of vertices both define time scales .",
    "the finite size scaling method discussed above is useful for processes affected by time - scales similar to , or shorter than , the sampling time .",
    "it is hard to use it to deduce the @xmath38 limits of @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "so in the absence of data sets with considerably longer sampling times , we have to focus on questions such as how the contact patterns affect the network reachability ( discussed in the previous two sections ) and short - time dynamic processes .",
    "we have studied how fast information can spread among people involved in electronic communication .",
    "four data sets  one from communication within an internet community and three e - mail data sets  are used .",
    "we find that these data sets can be characterized by a core with short path lengths and frequent contacts and a periphery to which information is relatively unlikely to reach .",
    "we note that the distribution of contacts per edge is highly skewed , and if this was not the case , the dynamics would be much faster .",
    "the fact that people engage in dialogs with others tend to slow down the dynamics ( compared to if the sending times were independent of earlier communication ) .",
    "this implies that the order of the contacts matter much , and one loose the full picture by converting contact sequences to weighted networks .",
    "we discuss finite size scaling by truncating the sampling interval and conclude that it is very useful method , but only for processes of the same time scale , or faster , as the sampling time .    in the discussion of the data sets , we mention the e - mail data sets are incomplete with respect to outer vertices ( vertices not belonging to the sampled e - mail server for the ebel _",
    "_  and eckmann _ et al . _",
    "data ) or not belonging to the sampled e - mail directories ( the enron data ) .",
    "e - mails between outer vertices are not recorded in the ebel _",
    "et al . _",
    "data and only partially present in the enron data whereas the eckmann _",
    "_  data does not include messages to outer vertices .",
    "we note that , while these different sampling procedures certainly affects many quantities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ncl ] ) , the conclusions above about how different structures affects the reachability remains intact .",
    "not all messages contain information that of the kind that people would relay to others . technically , considering also the finite size of the sampling intervals , we obtain lower bounds on the reachability time and upper bounds on the reachability fraction . on the other hand",
    "we believe that our qualitative conclusions would be unaltered for the averages of @xmath19 and @xmath17 in real information spreading .",
    "so far , the spreading processes we have mentioned has been the diffusion of rumors and similar information .",
    "our results may also apply to computer virus epidemiology .",
    "there is , presumably , a big difference between the contact sequences of viral and regular emails as the former often are sent to many recipients in a short time period , but only once per recipient  @xcite .",
    "the methods we use , however , are be perfectly applicable to a sequence of computer virus transmissions .",
    "there are many ways to extend this work .",
    "for example not only the shortest time respecting paths are relevant for spreading dynamics of different kinds  information might spread by a longer time respecting path .",
    "a sensible extension of this study would therefore to include these longer paths in the picture ( cf.ref .",
