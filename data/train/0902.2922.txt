    "graphene , or the physics of electrons on the honeycomb lattice , has recently received tremendous attention due to its semimetallic nature with low - energy quasiparticles behaving as massless dirac spinors ; a recent review can be found in ref .",
    "a crucial point is the stability of this semimetallic phase to particle - hole pairing . in particular ,",

    "@xcite the vanishing density of states at the fermi energy protects the semimetallic state against _ weak _ correlations .",
    "notably , a finite critical value of the repulsive hubbard interaction @xmath1 is required to destabilize the semimetallic state in favor of an antiferromagnetic mott insulator .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we will argue that the semimetallic state is unstable against the application of an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the mechanism behind this instability can be understood already at the mean - field level .",
    "@xcite the magnetic field generates a finite fermi surface density of states .",
    "a stoner instability for arbitrarily small values of the coulomb repulsion arises from the perfect nesting of the spin split fermi sheets .",
    "this triggers antiferromagnetic order with staggered magnetization perpendicular to the applied magnetic field and the opening of a charge gap . that the application of an in - plane magnetic field in the continuum limit facilitates a spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    "has already been pointed out in ref .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that those mean - field arguments indeed capture the correct physics , since exact quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations on the honeycomb lattice compare favorably with those mean - field results .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
