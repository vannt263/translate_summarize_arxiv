    "the random field ising model ( rfim ) is one of the most studied systems in magnetism ( for reviews , see @xcite and more recently @xcite ) , because of its mathematical simplicity and because the possibility of reproducting frustration , a phenomenon that occurs in real magnetic systems .",
    "in addition , the identification of the rfim with some diluted antiferromagnets in the presence of a uniform magnetic field @xcite , like @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite , have attracted the attention of theoretical and experimental researchers .",
    "the equilibrium rfim has extensively been studied by different approaches , such as mean - field theory @xcite , the renormalization group @xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite . however , the critical behavior of the nonequilibrium case @xcite is little understood , with the majority of the results concerning one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "a mean field theory was also developed @xcite , but numerical results are rare ; to the best of our knowledge , only a recent work considered the problem via mc simulations @xcite @xmath3 .",
    "on the fact that there is a consensus that _ equilibrium _ quenched models are a suitable representation of some realistic situations in physics , some controversy on basic issues persist , and the interpretation of laboratory experiments by models with quenched disorder is not satisfactory @xcite . concerning spin glasses , for example , quenched models like the edwards - anderson ( ea ) @xcite neglect the diffusion of magnetically active ions .",
    "diffusion constantly modifies the distance between each specific pair of spin ions in certain substances like dilute metallic alloys ( cumn , for example ) and , consequently , one should probably allow for variations both in space and time of the exchange interactions in a model @xcite .",
    "in the same way , we can imagine other disordered systems in which the random variables change in space and time , like random - field models .",
    "these effects do not seem to be correctly described by another class of equilibrium models , namely , the _ annealed _ systems . for example , the change with time of the spatial distribution of couplings in the annealed version of the ea model @xcite is constrained by the need to reach equilibrium with the other degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , impurities tend to be strongly correlated , which is not observed in most substances @xcite . as a consequence , the annealed version of the ea model do not exhibits a spin glass state @xcite .",
    "in addition , the equilibrium random - field models also present problems to describe theoretically experimental results .",
    "while annealed and quenched versions of the rfim predict continuous phase transitions between the ordered and disordered phases @xcite @xmath4 , measurements on diluted antiferromagnets like @xmath5 , which are prototypes of experimental realizations of systems under random fields @xcite , showed that these materials exhibit first - order phase transitions at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "thus , it has been claimed that _ nonequilibrium _",
    "models may be relevant to explain the behavior of certain materials involving microscopic disorder such as spin glasses and random - field systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the case of disorder in the magnetic field ,",
    "the nonequilibrium model is defined by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath6 where the first sumation @xmath7 represents the ( constant ) exchange interaction between nearest - neighbor pairs of spins and the second term models the effects of random magnetic fields .",
    "the nonequilibrium system is described at each time by hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) , and the random fields @xmath8 are spatially distributed according to a given probability distribution @xmath9 .",
    "this corresponds to the well - known equilibrium rfim , but @xmath8 is continuously changed by the kinetics in such a way that it always mantains itself as a realization of @xmath9 . as discussed in @xcite , this kind of dynamics induces randomness and a sort of dynamical frustration that does not occurs in equilibrium models . in other words , one may assume that spins and fields behave independently of each other so that a conflict occurs , and a steady nonequilibrium condition prevails asymptotically .",
    "this is consistent with the reported observation of nonequilibrium effects , for example , the influence of the details of the dynamical process ( kinetics ) on the steady states in some real systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    the study of nonequilibrium models defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) reveals many interesting features @xcite , with a rich variety of phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "the known above - discussed results reveal that the critical behavior is nonuniversal , but it generally depends on apparently irrelevant details of the dynamics , like diffusion of impurities , i.e. , the properties of the distribution of the random variables , and the transition rates chosen . in addition , nonequilibrium models may be relevant to describe theoretically some real systems @xcite , as a magnetic material under the action of a random ( or very rapidly fluctuating ) magnetic field , i.e. , a field that varies according to a given probability distribution with a period shorter than the mean time between successive transitions that modify the spin configuration , or a disordered system with fast and random diffusion of impurities like in random - field systems @xcite .    led by these motivations , we have studied the nonequilibrium random - field ising model ( nrfim ) on a cubic lattice with nearest - neighbors interactions and in the presence of a random magnetic field that follows a bimodal probability distribution .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations on lattices with sizes up to @xmath0 and our results suggest that the phase transitions are continuous in the high - temperature and low - field region , becoming of first - order type at low temperatures and high disorder strengths . in the low - field region ,",
    "a finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis shows that the system follows standard fss laws , as was claimed in @xcite .",
    "we have considered a random - field system described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) on a cubic lattice of linear dimension @xmath10 , with the random field @xmath11 following a bimodal probability distribution , @xmath12    .",
    "examples for low ( left side ) and high disorder strength @xmath13 ( right side ) are shown .",
    "as discussed in the text , the steady states are easily achieved for low and high @xmath13.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] .",

    "any configuration @xmath14 evolves stochastically with time by spin flips with rate @xmath15 which corresponds to the metropolis algorithm @xcite , and @xmath16 stands for the flip energy cost ( we set the boltzmann constant to unity ) . for the numerical implementation ,",
    "the algorithm is as follows : at each time step , a new configuration of random fields @xmath11 is generated according to @xmath17 , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ; then , every lattice site is visited , and a spin flip occurs according to rate ( [ eq3 ] ) . in other words , the random variables @xmath18 vary with time , i.e. , the system is described at each time by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , with @xmath18 distributed according to @xmath17 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "thus , we have two different characteristic time scales : one for the fluctuations of the spins and another one for the fluctuations of the random field , and for simplicity we have considered that these two fluctuations are independent ( a formal discussion about this is found in ref .",

    "in fact , in the annealed rfim phase diagram @xcite the critical temperature increases as we increase the magnetic - field intensity , whereas for the equilibrium quenched rfim @xcite and the nrfim the disorder strength may destroy the ferromagnetic order . however , at low temperatures , it is believed that the quenched case presents continuous transitions , whereas in the nonequilibrium one our simulations suggest that first - order transitions occur .",
