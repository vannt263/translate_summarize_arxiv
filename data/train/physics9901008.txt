    "how weakly do they interact with each other ?",
    "some physical processes can be sensitive to nonlinearities ; for example ionization may be energetically impossible for individual plasmons but allowed for states with multiple plasmon excitations and therefore , ionization rates may depend on the degree of nonlinearity .",

    "the photon energy was such that ionization is energetically possible only if at least two photons are absorbed . in this work",

    "unfortunately , the full tdlda is computationally difficult and rather opaque , in contrast to the perturbative approach that allows important quantities to be calculated directly .    from the point of view of surface plasmon dynamics , a very important quantity is the ionization rate of a two - plasmon excited state .",

    ", the ionization can take place without the mediation of the plasmon .",
    "also , the plasmon can be excited as a virtual state in which case the connection to the two - plasmon decay formula is unclear .",
    "we present in sect .  4 a more general treatment of the ionization process that includes these effects and allows the role of the plasmon to be isolated from other aspects of the ionization process .",
    "the important role of plasmon in screening and enhancement of the external field is made explicit in the formulas discussed there .",
