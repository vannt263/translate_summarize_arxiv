    "the force exerted on a particle by the surrounding beam at a distance @xmath17 from the beam centre is : @xmath194     from the beam centre can easily be easily calculated . ]    for simplicity , it can be assumed that the particle has only a horizontal offset from the beam centre ; in the frenet  serret coordinate system , eq . ( [ eq : space_charge_force ] ) becomes @xmath195 the influence of the space - charge force on transverse motion is derived by treating it as perturbation of the linear equation of motion , as discussed with the non - linear fields : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the classical particle radius . as the space - charge force is linear in @xmath23 , it introduces a gradient error , and gradient errors lead to tune shift .",
    "the tune shift from the space - charge around the whole ring with radius @xmath198 is @xmath199 as @xmath200 is related to the transverse size of the cylindrical beam , @xmath201 is related to the invariant of motion , @xmath202 .",
    "the space - charge tune shift can therefore be written as @xmath203 with @xmath204 .",
    "the tune shift is larger if the beam has higher brightness @xmath205 and lower energy .    in realistic beams",
    ", the particle density will not be uniform and the different particles will see different space - charge forces , depending on where they are in the beam . this will introduce a tune spread instead of a tune shift .",
    "an example of the tune spread due to space - charge in the cern ps booster is shown in fig . [",

    "unforeseen aperture limitations can cause beam losses . the aperture limitation may be the result of misalignment of equipment or movable equipment , such as screens , girders or collimators , that is only partially retracted .",
    "aperture limitations may also be introduced by orbit changes from quadrupole misalignment or orbit bumps .",
    "orbit bumps might be needed for extraction systems or to introduce crossing angles in colliders .",
    "orbit bumps might also result from corrections made as a result of false beam position monitor readings .",
    "fast transverse kickers , such as aperture kicker magnets , tune kicker magnets , crab cavities or transverse feedback systems , can excite significant fractions of the beam to high amplitudes within a single or a few turns .",
    "power supply limitations or special run configurations are put in place to avoid large deflections from the aperture kicker at high intensity in the lhc .",
    "injection kickers or extraction kickers firing asynchronously can be very dangerous for high - intensity machines .",

    "beam losses can also originate from uncaptured beams .",
    "uncaptured beam is generated at injection if part of the bunch is injected outside the rf acceptance .",
    "many mechanisms can drive the beam out of the bucket after injection , for example , intra - beam scattering , beam  beam interactions or malfunctioning equipment .",
    "malfunctioning equipment comprises noise in the phase loop , badly adjusted longitudinal blow - up or the switch - off of an rf cavity , resulting in a reduction in the total available voltage and hence reduction of the rf acceptance .",
    "once uncaptured , the time taken for the particles to get lost on the vacuum chamber depends on the energy loss per turn due to synchrotron radiation , electron cloud or impedance and the so - called _ momentum aperture _ in @xmath105 for the given mechanical aperture , dispersion and beta function .",
    "the power supplies of the circuits powering the machine elements can fail and the magnetic field seen by the beam of the concerned elements will then decay .",
    "failing dipole magnets will generate an orbit distortion that changes with time .",
    "if the failure is sufficiently slow ( e.g.  in the lhc , over more than 10 turns ) , the closed orbit formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : orbit_distortion ] ) for a time - varying field error can be used to calculate what happens to the beam , @xmath206 where @xmath143 is the number of dipole magnets connected in series to the failing power supply .",
    "a power supply has many possible failure cases .",
    "the function @xmath207 needs to be established . in most powering failure cases ,",
    "the voltage is set to zero and the current decays as @xmath208 where the time constant @xmath2 is defined by the resistance and inductance of the circuit as @xmath209 . in the case of a main dipole magnet quench in the lhc , the current in the quenching magnet would decay as @xmath210 where @xmath211 has been found to be @xmath212 .",
    "a failing quadrupole circuit will move the tune in the tune diagram with the risk of crossing resonance lines .",
    "the beam size will also change as a result of the change of the beta functions , as discussed for gradient errors .",
    "if the orbit is not zero in the quadrupole , the failing quadrupole will also change the orbit .",
