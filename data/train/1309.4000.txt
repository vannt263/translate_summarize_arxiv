    "long - haul communication research has during the latest decade become completely focused on coherent transmission .",
    "the data throughput has been increased by better utilization of the available bandwidth and receiver digital signal processing ( dsp ) has allowed many signal impairments to be compensated for .",
    "further significant increase of the data rate is expected through the use of multicore / multimode fibers  @xcite , but while this development is exciting , there are also significant challenges . for example , these approaches call for the deployment of new fibers .",
    "it is also important to use available resources to the greatest possible extent .",
    "the increase in spectral efficiency enabled by coherent communication is actually an example of this .",
    "for example , using a channel spacing of 50  ghz , it is now possible to transmit 100  gbit / s using polarization - multiplexed quadrature phase - shift keying . comparing this with the traditional 10  gbit / s using on  off keying ,",
    "the data throughput is increased by a factor of ten . in this work ,",
    "the focus is on optical networking . by developing routing algorithms with awareness of the nonlinear physical properties of the channel",
    ", it would be possible to operate optical links closer to the optimum performance , and this would further increase the throughput in optical communication networks .",
    "optical networks are not as flexible as their electronic counterparts , but there are several efforts that aim at improving the situation by investigating , _",
    "e.g. _ , cognitive  @xcite and elastic  @xcite optical networks .",
    "an increased flexibility requires , _",
    "e.g. _ , hardware routing of channels in the optical domain and a monitoring system responsible for the scheduling of the data streams .",
    "it is also desirable that the coherent transmission and detection can be done using a number of different modulation formats and symbol rates , chosen dynamically in response to time - varying traffic demands and network load .",
    "hence , the traditional wavelength - division multiplexing ( wdm ) paradigm , in which the available spectrum is divided into a fixed grid of equal - bandwidth channels , is being replaced by the concept of _ flexible - grid _",
    "wdm  @xcite .",
    "the scheduling algorithm requires a nonlinear model of the physical layer .",
    "while the problem of linear routing and wavelength assignment is well investigated , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , no nonlinear model that combines reasonable accuracy and low computational complexity seems to have been published .",
    "both these properties are necessary in order to be able to find a close - to - optimal solution in real time .",
    "this excludes simulations of the nonlinear schrdinger equation as an alternative , but the recently suggested gaussian noise ( gn ) model  @xcite provides a tool to approach this question .",
    "unfortunately , also the general formulation of the gn model is computationally complex and further simplification is necessary . in this paper",
    ", we start from a description of how a model suitable for network optimization can be formulated and derive such a model from the gn model .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_approach ] , the considered problem is stated and the approach is outlined . the main assumptions and approximations",
    "are given in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] . the model for a multichannel fiber span",
    "is derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : span ] , and it is expanded into a network model in sec .",
    "[ sec : network - model ] . after a brief discussion about the validity of the model assumptions ,",
    "the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "[ sec_discussion ] .",
    "a network consists of a number of _ nodes , _ _ i.e. _ , transceivers or routing hardware components , connected by optical communication _ links_.",
    "each link consists of @xmath0 concatenated _ fiber spans , _ which each consists of an optical fiber followed by an erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) .",
    "each link can transmit @xmath1 simultaneous _ channels _ using wdm .",
    "in such a network , a large number of _ connections _ between transceiver nodes are established . for each connection",
    "there is a _ route , _ _",
    "i.e. _ , a set of fiber links that connect the transmitting and receiving nodes via a number of intermediate nodes .",
    "we consider an all - optical network , implying that the signal is in the optical domain throughout the path .",
    "the intermediate nodes typically consist of reconfigurable add / drop multiplexers and may also include wavelength conversion",
    ".      for any connection through the network , there will be signal degradation caused by a number of mechanisms .",
    "the two most fundamental ones are amplifier noise and nonlinear signal distortion due to the kerr nonlinearity .",
    "while the amplified spontaneous emission from optical amplifiers is easy to model , the latter presents a big challenge .",
    "additional degrading effects include the finite signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) already at the transmitter , which may be important for large quadrature amplitude modulation constellations , and the crosstalk between different wdm channels in routing components and in the receiver . however , the efforts to increase the spectral efficiency have led to sophisticated shaping of the optical spectrum .",
    "techniques such as orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing and nyquist wdm have demonstrated optical signal spectra that are very close to rectangular  @xcite . using a dsp filter , the channel crosstalk",
    "can then be very small in the receiver .",
    "optical routing components , such as reconfigurable optical add - drop multiplexers , are more difficult to realize as the filter function is implemented in optical hardware , but the lack of wdm channel spectral overlap reduces the crosstalk also here .",
    "signal degradation due to , _",
    "e.g. _ , polarization - mode dispersion is neglected as it is compensated for by the receiver equalizer .",
    "thus , we here choose to focus on the nonlinear effects generated as the interplay between the kerr nonlinearity and the chromatic dispersion , known as the nonlinear interference ( nli ) within the gn model  @xcite .      the aim of the modeling effort is to find an approximate quantitative model for the nli for a large number of connections between network transceivers .",
    "for each connection there is a route , _",
    "i.e. _ , a set of fiber links that connect the transmitting and the receiving nodes via a number of intermediate nodes . each link can transmit @xmath1 wdm channels and for each channel @xmath2 , the center frequency @xmath3 , the bandwidth @xmath4 , and the power @xmath5 are chosen .",
    "this is summarized as the set of channel parameters @xmath6 . for a given link , the wdm channels",
    "can then be written as the set @xmath7 .",
    "the physical parameters of a link are the power attenuation @xmath8 , the group - velocity dispersion @xmath9 , and the nonlinearity @xmath10 . here",
    "$ ] denotes the distance from the beginning of the first fiber , where @xmath12 is the total length of the link ( possibly including several fiber spans ) .",
    "the link parameters are summarized in the set @xmath13 .",
    "assume that there are a number of planned connections . to make sure that each transmission can succeed ,",
    "the corresponding connection must satisfy the snr requirement for the selected modulation format at the receiving node .",
    "the purpose of the proposed model is to calculate the snr for a number of simultaneous connections in a network , given the network topology and the parameter sets @xmath14 and @xmath15 for every link in the network . to the best of our knowledge , no such model exits in the literature .",
    "the total noise variance is the sum of all noise sources .",
    "we view amplifier noise as being added after the power gain in each optical amplifier with a variance related to the power gain and the amplifier noise figure  @xcite .",
    "the nli is generated during the propagation through the fibers , but within the gn model , we view it as being added after the gain in the amplifier , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the same location and at the same power level as the amplifier noise .",
    "we assume there is no periodic ( hardware ) compensation for chromatic dispersion , which seems to be a likely scenario for the future , and that no dsp compensation of nonlinear effects is carried out . under these assumptions",
    ", the gn model is the current state of the art and in fact also seems to be the only approach that can be simplified to a sufficiently low - complexity model . while there are still open questions  @xcite about the range of validity of the signal model used in the gn model  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 3 ) ) , the agreement with simulations of the full model equations has been shown to be very good  @xcite .",
    "we discuss some known facts about the validity of the gn model in section  [ sec_discussion ] .",
    "starting from the gn model , assumptions and approximations needed to obtain a network model are introduced in the following .",
    "the derivation is started from the gn model as stated in  @xcite .",
    "as coherent systems typically transmit and receive the two polarization - multiplexed channels simultaneously , these are viewed as a unit .",
    "assuming that the signal power spectral density ( psd ) is equal in both polarizations , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath16 , we use  ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 26 ) and ( 27 ) ) to obtain the nli psd @xmath17 where @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the nli psd in the @xmath20 polarization but @xmath21 implies that @xmath22 .",
    "the definitions for the normalized power evolution function , @xmath23 , and the accumulated dispersion , @xmath24 , are given in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  ii - b ) .",
    "notice that the channel parameter @xmath5 is the power corresponding to @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the power _ per polarization_.",
    "the third - order dispersion has been neglected as it has very small impact on the nli  @xcite . finding the nli psd at a given frequency",
    "involves evaluating three nested integrals .",
    "the numerical complexity of this is high , which motivates our search for analytical simplifications of this expression .",
    "the gn model was originally derived for a single link where all wdm channels propagate together from the transmitter to the receiver , but in the network model we need the capability of wdm channel switching / routing .",
    "the gn model builds on a certain signal model  ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 3 ) ) , where a fundamental assumption is that the launched signal can be written on ( or , at least , quickly approaches ) this form .",
    "then , during propagation , the changes of the launched signal are accounted for by a linearized propagation equation . as the signal leaves one fiber span and enters the next ,",
    "the phase relation between different frequency components is conserved and this leads to a coherent accumulation of the complex amplitude of the signal perturbation corresponding to the nli . in a network , channels can be added or dropped , which is incompatible with the original gn model .",
    "poggiolini _ et al .",
    "_  have investigated the consequences from assuming that the nli generated in different fiber spans can be added _",
    "incoherently _ , _ i.e. _ , that the nli psds are summed instead of the corresponding complex amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "this assumption results in a significant analytical ( and numerical ) simplification , and numerical simulations have shown that the difference compared with the exact result is small . from the discussion above it is clear that in a network , the situation is neither fully coherent nor fully incoherent , but we will use the assumption that the nli accumulates incoherently .",
    "it is then possible to calculate the nli psd generated in each channel in each fiber span separately and then sum these contributions along the entire route .",
    "unfortunately , this assumption seems to slightly underestimate the nli  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  ix ) .    for a given link ,",
    "the nli psd @xmath26 is a function of @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "the dependence on the link is static since the hardware does not change , but @xmath27 must be easy to evaluate as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "the assumption of incoherent nli accumulation implies that we can split each link @xmath15 into @xmath0 spans @xmath28 , @xmath29 , calculate the nli independently for each span , and obtain the total nli for a link from the nli contributions from each span . in the special case",
    "that all spans are identical , it is obtained that @xmath30  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 18 ) ) .",
    "we assume that the loss of each fiber span is exactly compensated for by an edfa placed at the end of the span .",
    "the received power is thus equal to the transmitted power @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , since the link parameters @xmath28 are assumed to be constant within a fiber span , the @xmath32 dependence is dropped from now on . without loss of generality",
    ", we will therefore calculate the nli generated in a single fiber span in section  [ sec : span ] and then in section  [ sec : network - model ] extend these results to the network layer .",
    "in this section , the nli is derived for all channels in a single fiber span .",
    "the inputs are the channel parameters @xmath14 , and the link parameters @xmath28 .",
    "the output is the nli psd @xmath33 for @xmath2 .",
    "although this case has been discussed in the literature , we study it in detail for two reasons .",
    "first , no expression seems to be published that gives the result for all channels in a flexible - grid wdm system , which is necessary for a complete network model .",
    "for example , poggiolini _",
    "et al . _",
    "mainly present results for the center wdm channel , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 13)(15 ) ) .",
    "the second reason is that we find it useful to summarize all calculations to make this document self - contained .",
    "as seen from  ( [ eq_total_psd ] ) , the signal psd for each individual wdm channel must be known .",
    "the exact shape depends on the transmitter , but as mentioned , much effort is currently spent on making the optical signal spectra close to rectangular  @xcite . since this shape can be used with very small guard bands and also leads to minimal channel crosstalk , it is likely that signals in future systems will approximate this shape .",
    "thus , we assume that each channel spectrum is rectangular , which implies that the channel psd is completely specified by @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "the channel psds may have different center frequencies , bandwidths , and powers , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig_approx_int_signal_psd ] .    from and , the nli is @xmath36 where @xmath37 was used .",
    "this approximation is accurate for a fiber loss of 7  db or more  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  xi - a ) .",
    "the nli is frequency - dependent and the channel @xmath34 is affected by the amount of nli that passes the corresponding receiver filter . due to the assumption about the signal psd shape , the matched filter has a rectangular frequency response . as it is difficult to analytically account for the variation of @xmath26 within a channel , we assume that the nli variance for channel @xmath34 can be approximated as @xmath38 , _",
    "i.e. _ , that it can be based on the value at the center frequency .",
    "this is a good approximation , as the nli varies slowly within a given channel see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  5 ) and ( * ? ? ? * fig .  1 ) .",
    "furthermore , this assumption is conservative in the sense that it typically leads to a slight overestimation of the nli .",
    "the next step is to find an approximate value for @xmath33 for channel @xmath39 .",
    "this is done by generalizing the approach previously used for the center channel  @xcite . as seen in ( [ eq_nli ] ) ,",
    "the integration is over the entire @xmath40 plane , but the integrand is nonzero only within distinct regions determined by the product of the psds . to exemplify",
    ", we consider channel @xmath41 in the set of wdm channels in fig .",
    "[ fig_approx_int_signal_psd ] .",
    "the psd product in is a piecewise constant function that is illustrated in the @xmath40 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig_approx_int_ch_2_fwm_eff_and_domain ] by the dark gray regions .",
    "the vertical , horizontal , and diagonal regions illustrate @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the product of the psds is nonzero only where three regions overlap .",
    "it is seen that this corresponds to polygons of different shapes , making exact integration difficult .",
    "the integrand weight function @xmath45 is illustrated by the colored contours and in order to discuss its properties we introduce @xmath46 in this way , @xmath47 is the fraction of the weight function evaluated at the edge of the @xmath39th channel spectrum relative to its channel center frequency . using a dispersion parameter @xmath48  ps/(nm@xmath49 km ) and attenuation @xmath50  db / km , we find @xmath51 for a 10  ghz channel and @xmath52 for a 28  ghz channel .",
    "when the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are increased , @xmath55 decreases rapidly .",
    "we proceed by assuming that ( i ) only the polygons containing @xmath56 or @xmath57 need to be included and ( ii ) each polygon can be approximated by a rectangle of minimal area that contains the polygon .",
    "the first of these assumptions is equivalent to including _ self - channel interference _",
    "( sci ) , represented by the single polygon that surrounds @xmath58 , and _ cross - channel interference _ ( xci ) .",
    "a similar approximation was discussed and illustrated in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) for the center channel when the channels have equal bandwidths and spacing .",
    "this approximation typically leads to a very small error , since @xmath55 is negligible elsewhere .",
    "the second assumption leads to an overestimation of the nli .",
    "for example , in the sci case , the polygon area is extended by a factor @xmath59 , but the effect from this is reduced since @xmath55 is highest in the center . as shown above , this has some impact on the result for narrow - band channels .",
    "improvements of this approximation are possible , for example following  @xcite , but here the simple and conservative assumption above is used .",
    "channels with different center frequencies , bandwidths , and powers . ]    ) , the vertical , horizontal , and diagonal shaded regions correspond to @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath60 , respectively , where we choose @xmath61 .",
    "this illustrates the qualitative behavior of the numerator in for the example wdm channels in fig .",
    "[ fig_approx_int_signal_psd ] .",
    "only the intersections of these regions contribute to the integral .",
    "the contours show the weight function from ( [ eq_weight ] ) , supporting the notion of considering only the regions containing @xmath56 or @xmath57 . ]",
    "inspection of ( [ eq_nli ] ) shows that the result is unchanged if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are substituted for each other , which in fig .",
    "[ fig_approx_int_ch_2_fwm_eff_and_domain ] corresponds to mirroring the entire integration domain in the line @xmath64 .",

    "the result above has been presented in terms of the special function @xmath78 . in order to obtain a more intuitive expression , avoiding any special functions , we can approximate one step further .",
    "this can be done with an asymptotic expansion of the dilog function . using the result from appendix  [ sec_asymp ] , ( [ eq_g1 ] )",

    "we are now ready to summarize the model and extend it to a network of multiple spans and links .",

    "it is evaluated in two stages ; first to evaluate the channel quality of every _ link _ in the network , and second , to evaluate the quality of every _",
    "connection_.    the first stage utilizes the following inputs for a given link , denoted by @xmath82 , in the network :    * the link parameters @xmath28 of every fiber span @xmath83 .",
    "these are assumed to be the same for all channels . *",

    "3 .   for @xmath85 , calculate the snr as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 represents the total linear and nonlinear noise contributions .",
    "this is repeated for every link @xmath82 in the network . alternatively , and may be replaced by , which is simpler but less accurate .    in the second stage",
    ", the snr of an arbitrary connection in the network is calculated .",
    "the network is all - optical and assuming no format conversion , the bandwidth @xmath4 is constant for all links in the connection .",
    "the center frequency @xmath3 may change in nodes due to ( ideal ) wavelength conversion .",
    "the power @xmath5 is constant , as we have assumed the gains to balance the losses .",
    "however , our model holds also if @xmath5 changes between the links in a route , if the noise added in this process is negligible compared to the total @xmath84 .",
    "the input to the second stage can be represented as follows .    * the route of the connection , represented as @xmath90 link assignments @xmath91 and channel assignments @xmath92 . * the link and channel snrs @xmath93 obtained from the first stage above .    based on this input ,",
    "the snr of the connection under consideration is finally obtained as @xmath94",
    "the described model is simple enough to allow optimization studies of optical networks operating in the nonlinear regime .",
    "as has been made clear in the derivation , a number of assumptions and approximations have been introduced .",
    "it is not possible to quantify the impact of these without performing a detailed numerical or experimental study , which is outside the scope of this work and we will instead qualitatively discuss the model accuracy .",
    "first , the model obviously relies on the gn model and already ( [ eq_total_psd ] ) and ( [ eq_channel_func ] ) are approximate expressions .",
    "a fundamental assumption is that the dispersive effects are strong .",
    "this is difficult to formulate strictly but the gn model should not be used in systems with periodic dispersion compensation .",
    "furthermore , the signal bandwidth should be sufficiently large and this means that single - channel transmission is less accurately modeled .",
    "while these assumptions are likely to be compatible with future optical networks , there are some further questions about the model validity . for example",
    ", it is a surprising fact that the model has no dependence on the choice of modulation format .",
    "the discussion about the validity of the gn model is ongoing and we expect that these questions will eventually be resolved .    the impact of the assumption about incoherent noise accumulation is difficult to quantify .",
    "it is known that this does introduce errors and the special case expression from section  [ sec_nli_acc ] is more accurately written as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 $ ] depends on both the signal and the system  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  ix ) .",
    "there seems to be no exact analytical expression for @xmath97 available and this approach would also require all spans in the links to be identical .",
    "we see no obvious way to improve this approximation but it should be remembered that the wdm channel switching will reduce the error from this assumption .    finally , approximations were introduced in the integration of . as seen , the value of @xmath55 is quickly reduced as the frequency separation is increased .",
    "thus we expect the choice to include only sci and xci to lead to very small error , as long as not too narrow channel bandwidths are considered , but this is , as discussed , an inherent assumption of the gn model . for the same reason , the error introduced by approximating the integration polygons by rectangles is small",
    ".    we do not expect the proposed model to be the last word in the development of nonlinear fiber - optic network models , but rather a starting point .",
    "it is , to our knowledge , the first model that can predict the signal quality independently for a number of heterogeneous channels in a flexible - grid wdm system .",
    "such a model is essential for efficient , if not optimal , resource management in elastic optical networks , which is an interesting and emerging area for future research .",
