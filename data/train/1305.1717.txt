    "are there moons around exoplanets ? this topic has aroused the interest of scientists since the discovery of the extrasolar giant planets in the 1990s @xcite . in our solar system , all giant planets have many moons .",
    "natural satellites of the giant planets are divided into two categories : regular satellites and irregular satellites .",
    "regular satellites with little eccentricities and orbital inclinations most probably formed in the circumplanetary disks during the formation of the planet itself ; while irregular satellites with significant inclinations and eccentricities were most likely to have been captured at a much later stage in the evolution of the planet .",
    "another difference is that regular satellites are close to their host planets , while the irregular satellites are smaller bodies moving on distant orbits .",
    "the prevalence of moons in the solar system implies that extrasolar giant planets may also harbour moon systems .",
    "searching exomoons also have significance in exploring extrasolar lives . to date ,",
    "many extrasolar giant planets have been found in the habitable zone ( hz ) @xcite , but they support neither a solid nor a liquid surface near which organisms might dwell .",
    "exomoons of these giant planets , if exist , may be alternative cradles for the extrasolar lives @xcite . based on the kepler mission ,",
    "exomoon - search methods and projects have been proposed by several authors @xcite . lately , several viable moon - hosting planet candidates have been analyzed , although no compelling evidences for exomoons are found yet @xcite .    however , extrasolar giant planets have very different properties compared to the giant planets in the solar system .",
    "a prominent feature is that extrasolar giant planets have significant eccentricities , whereas four giant planets in solar system are on nearly circular orbits .",
    "currently , one possible mechanism that can explain this is planet - planet scattering ( pps ) between giant planets ( @xcite , etc . ) . some of other phenomena of exoplanet systems can also be explained by involving pps such as the formation of hot jupiters ( hjs ) @xcite ; mutual inclinations between planets in multi - planet systems @xcite .    strong evidence of pps in multiple - planet systems such as the @xmath0 and @xcite implies that pps may be a natural dynamical process .",
    "actually , even in the solar system , studies by @xcite have shown that pps between saturn and one of the ice giants ( uranus or neptune ) need to have occurred to reproduce the current secular properties of the giant planets , whereas other mechanism such as smooth migration of the giant planets through a planetesimal disk @xcite can not reproduce them .",
    "if pps indeed took place in the formation process of exoplanets , it is natural to ask whether and how such a strong dynamical process affects the survival of their primordial ( regular ) moons ? in this _ letter _ , some preliminary studies are carried out on this topic .",
    "according to the core accretion theory , giant planets can only form outside the snow line . however , the diversity of the protoplanetary disk , the disk - driven migration , the presence of secular resonances such as the lidov - kozai effects make the configuration of exoplanet systems diverse @xcite . as for the disk migration , the speed and direction depend intricately on disk physics @xcite , so the observed orbital architectures of exoplanet systems can not be reproduced well even if we consider normal migration model and planet growth model . here , we use giant planet formation model in @xcite and similar initial conditions proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hill radius of the @xmath4th planet and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 g @xmath8 , @xmath9 au ( the innermost planet is near the snow line ) .",
    "we also assume that @xmath10 satisfies a uniform distribution between 1 and 15 @xmath11 .",
    "the initial masses of the planets obtained with this procedure are between about 0.25 and 1.7 @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is the mass of jupiter .",
    "such initial configurations can reproduce at least two observed properties of exoplanets : 1 ) the observed eccentricity distribution of exoplanets ; 2 ) the proportion of the potential hjs ( @xmath13 planets with periapse distances @xmath14 0.03 au @xcite ) . for moons , people are generally concerned about the earth - like moons @xcite .",
    "@xcite indicates that earth - like moons should not form for jupiter - mass planets .",
    "whether it also holds in the extrasolar systems is unclear . according to @xcite ,",
    "moons satisfying two criterions are habitable : 1 ) large enough ( @xmath15 0.12 @xmath16 ) to retain a substantial and long - lived atmosphere ; 2 ) possess a strong sheltered magnetic field .",
    "however , a remarkable discovery of the galileo spacecraft is that ganymede have a magnetosphere , which suggest that some moons ( @xmath17 ) would be immune to the atmospheric loss due to the constant bombardment of energetic ions from its parent planet s magnetosphere .",
    "besides , titan has a dense atmosphere even though its mass is 0.02 @xmath16 .",
    "based on the above analyses , we consider three kinds of moons : @xmath18 ( earth - like ) , 0.1 @xmath16 ( mars - like ) , 0.01 @xmath16 ( moon - like ) .",
    "@xcite derived the critical semi - major axis ( sma ) @xmath19 of a stable moon based the hill stability criteria , it is @xmath20x}}{{3\\lambda \\left ( { 1 + \\lambda } \\right)}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22^{1/3}}$ ] , @xmath23 is the sma of planet , @xmath24 is the mass of central star and we take @xmath25 in this work .",
    "we define the initial sma of the moon as @xmath26 the purpose of doing so is to guarantee that the escape of the moon is caused by the scattering between giant planets rather than the planet - moon system itself",
    ". the lower limit of sma of the moon is the roche radius @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mean densities of the moon . @xmath29",
    "$ ] are explored ( ensure that the moon is outside the roche limit ) .",
    "we do a few approximations here as done by other studies on exomoons . 1 .",
    "tidal effects can be ignored if the dynamical timescale concerned is much shorter than the tidal evolution timescale @xcite .",
    "the typical tidal evolution timescale of the moons is gyr , which is much longer than the pps timescales ( @xmath30 in this work ) .",
    "so no significant tidal evolution of the moon occurs during pps .",
    "2 . the interactions between the moons ( around the same giant planet )",
    "are ignored @xcite . though the interactions between moons may cause additional instabilities , other factors such as resonance ( mean motion resonance , spin - orbit resonance or laplace resonance ) between them may guarantee stability . above complex issues",
    "are out of the scope of this letter .",
    "our model contains 3 planets , each bears an identical moon . because irregular moons are thought most likely to have been captured at a much later stage in the evolution of the planet , we do nt consider the effects of pps on the survival of irregular moons .",
    "both the planets and moons are on initial coplanar and circular orbits .",
    "we use the bulirsch - stoer integrator in mercury package @xcite , the accuracy requirements is @xmath31 . for every combination of @xmath32 $ ] ,",
    "we perform 100 runs , thus a total of 1500 runs of numerical simulations are performed in this work .",
    "the integral time is @xmath33 yr , we find it is long enough to give the credible results .",
    "if the moon s planetocentric energy became positive , we think it has escaped from the planet @xcite .",
    "1 shows a randomly selected , representative example of dynamical evolution of planets plus moons system , showing both the chaotic phases and the stable final configurations . in table 1 , we show the overview of results .",
    "evidently , the pps between giant planets have violent impacts on their moons .",
    "even if the moons are initially located at the inner stable region of giant planets ( @xmath34 ) , nearly 2/3 systems have lost their moons completely . for three moons of different masses ,",
    "simulation results are similar , it is understandable because that the mass of the moon is involved in the critical sma ( equation 3 ) . in order to give some clues for the future observations , we give detailed analysis based on the architectures of extrasolar giant planet systems . after the scattering process",
    ", the resulting systems can be classified into two categories based on the final configuration of the giant planets : 1 ) two - planet systems ; 2 ) one - planet systems . according to above categories",
    ", we discuss the survival of exomoons in detail .",
    "_ one - planet systems .",
    "_ for the total number of 500 systems with the same mass of moons , the average fractions resulting in one - planet systems ( with or without moons ) are @xmath35 ( 1 @xmath16 ) , @xmath36 ( 0.1 @xmath16 ) , @xmath37 ( 0.01 @xmath16 ) , respectively . but",
    "the fractions of remaining one planet with a moon are only @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "it implies that if a single planet on an eccentric orbit comes from a primordial multiple system through pps , the probability of harbouring their primordial moons is very low .",
    "_ two - planet systems .",
    "_ if two giant planets survived the scattering process , they must be on well - separated orbits to ensure the long - term stability .",
    "the total fractions of two - planet systems for three types of moons are @xmath41 ( 1 @xmath16 ) , @xmath42 ( 0.1 @xmath16 ) and @xmath43 ( 0.01 @xmath16 ) , respectively . in these cases ,",
    "the fractions of each planet having a moon ( 2p + 2 m ) are @xmath44 ( 1 @xmath16 ) , @xmath45 ( 0.1 @xmath16 ) , @xmath38 ( 0.01 @xmath16 ) .",
    "the fractions of only one moon left ( 2p + 1 m ) are @xmath46 ( 1 @xmath16 ) , @xmath47 ( 0.1 @xmath16 ) , @xmath48 ( 0.01 @xmath16 ) .",
    "in significant number of cases , there are only two planets left in the system ( 2p + 0 m ) , the fractions are @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . by the way",
    ", we found 8 systems where moon exchanges take place .",
    "the fractions of them are only @xmath52 in total 1500 systems .",
    "in above 8 systems , 5 of them are ` 2p + 1 m ' systems , 2 are ` 2p + 2 m ' systems , 1 belongs to ` 1p + 1 m ' systems .",
    "compared to the faithful survived moons , the promiscuous ones are insignificant .",
    "we do nt discuss the details of them in this letter .",
    "evidently , the survivability of the moons in two - planet systems is higher than that in one - planet systems . since the ` 2p + 1 m ' systems are the dominant outcomes where at least one stable moon survived in two - planet systems , we focus on these cases . in fig .",
    "2 , we give the a - e map for all the survived planets ( @xmath53 ) . as we can see in fig .",
    "2 , moon - bearing planets generally have small or moderate eccentricities .    \\1 . _",
    "mass dependencies_. it can be seen from fig .",
    "3 that the lower mass one of the two planets have the larger chance of bearing moons . in all the ` 2p + 1 m ' systems",
    "( 275 , see table 2 ) , @xmath54 systems ( 241 ) have a moon encircling the lower mass planet . from the viewpoint of dynamical stability ,",
    "this conclusion is somewhat counter - intuitive because the massive planet seems easier to hold a moon .",
    "actually , in significant cases , the bigger planets resulted from the merger of two planets ( the total fraction is @xmath55 in all the ` 2p + 1 m ' cases , see table 2 ) , which means that their moons have been destroyed in the process of close encounters between two merged planets .",
    "_ collisions vs. ejections_. two - planet systems formed through two channels : collisional merger of two planets or ejection of one planet .",
    "in all the 1032 two - planet systems ( including no moon systems ) , @xmath56 ( 826 ) are derived from merge , @xmath57 ( 206 ) comes from ejections .",
    "one may argue : collisional mergers are the dominant outcomes , which makes the ` 2p + 1 m ' systems due to merges dominant .",
    "it is not the whole story . in above 206 systems , @xmath58 ( 185 )",
    "are no - moon systems , ejection systems account for only @xmath59 ( 21 ) of all the ` 2p + 1 m ' systems . of ` 2p + 1 m ' systems",
    "may be unphysical one moon of two merged planets survived the merge process and encircles the merged body .",
    "they are discarded in fig.3 ] it means that the survival rate of moons in two - planet systems formed due to ejections is very low .",
    "ejection of one planet in a system needs more frequent close encounters than collisional merger @xcite , so the low survival rate of the moon is understandable .    even in all the ` 2p + 1 m ' systems formed due to ejections , only about half of them ( 12/21 ) have moons encircling the bigger planets .",
    "it shows the chaotic nature of pps .",
    "for example , if the smallest planet ( in the initial three - planet system ) is ejected out of the system due to close encounters mainly between it and the biggest one , their moons are destroyed , whereas the moon of the moderate - mass planet survived , so the moon - bearing planet is the smaller one of the two surviving planets .",
    "_ inner vs. outer_. we also find that the outer planets have the larger chance of harbouring moons than the inner ones",
    ". the ratios of outer planets harbouring moons to the inner ones are 65/31 ( 1 @xmath16 ) , 56/41 ( 0.1 @xmath16 ) and 55/27 ( 0.01 @xmath16 ) , respectively .",
    "this preference seems independent of the initial mass distribution of three planets .",
    "our procedure ( equation 1 ) produce significant systems with @xmath60 , where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the mass of initial inner , middle and outer planet , respectively .",
    "we perform 200 additional simulations to check whether sma dependencies are related to the initial mass distribution of giant planets .",
    "we randomly selected planets mass according to the observed distribution of exoplanet masses : @xmath64 @xcite , the masses are limited in the range of 0.3 - 1.7 @xmath12 .",
    "we make all the systems satisfy @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "other initial conditions are similar to section 2 .",
    "we found the ratios of outer planets harbouring moons to the inner ones are 39/17 in all the 56 ` 2p + 1 m ' systems .",
    "it implies that collisional mergers take place mainly in the inner region during pps .",
    "interestingly , within kepler multiple - candidate systems , the larger planets is most often the one with the longer period for planet pairs for which one or both objects are approximately neptune - sized or larger @xcite . besides , many planet pairs are found near low - order mean - motion resonances @xcite , it accords with resonant capture @xcite of planets followed by turbulent removal from resonance @xcite .",
    "this scenario is thought as an origin of pps @xcite .",
    "consequently , sma dependencies of exomoons in multiple planet system can give us clues about the evolution of planet systems .",
    "_ hjs and giant planets in hz .",
    "_ if hjs formed by scattering mechanism @xcite , their primordial moons may be completely destroyed , it can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "2 . in this mechanism , planets need to achieve great eccentricities to form a potential hj , which means they must undergo strong dynamical process , so the survivability of their moons is very low . we also find that some giant planets in hz can hold their moons after strong pps . in this work ,",
    "the main aim is to see the impact of the pps on the survival rate of the moons rather than to reproduce the observed amount of hjs or hz giant planets .",
    "the probability of forming hjs and giant planets in hz are closely related to the initial locations of giant planets .",
    "additional simulations are performed using similar initial conditions ( giant planets ) as suggested by @xcite or @xcite , we find similar conclusions besides the amount of hjs and giant planets in hz .    finally , we found that some moons are stripped from their parent planets in the scattering process and thus become _ planets _ encircling the star on the stable orbits ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in some cases , the remaining small planets ( original moon ) and giant planets constitute a solar - like system ( terrestrial planets in inner region and gas giant planets in the outer orbits ) . though the formation of earth - like planets through this mechanism is infrequent , it has enlightening meanings .",
    "the origin and amount of the water on earth is an unresolved problem .",
    "many attempts are made to explain the source of water @xcite .",
    "if the inner planets themselves or some embryos are originally the moons of giant planets ( such as ganymede ) , then significant water content is understandable .",
    "this mechanism may be unlikely in the solar system , but dramatic dynamical process in exoplanet systems can not exclude this possibility .",
    "in this letter , we focus on the impact of pps on the survival of exomoons .",
    "although there are some uncertainties in the model , some preliminary conclusions can be drawn from simulations . 1 , pps is a destructive process to the moon systems , planets in single planet systems , if they have large eccentricities , are not the ideal moon - search targets .",
    "2 , if hjs formed through pps mechanism as suggested by many authors , their original moons have little chance to survive .",
    "3 , exoplanets with small eccentricities in multiple systems more likely hold their primordial moons .",
    "4 , the massive planets in multiple systems may not be the preferred moon - search targets if they formed by collision - merger mechanism as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we expect exomoon - search projects such as `` hunt for exomoons with kepler '' ( hek ) @xcite to give us interesting discoveries in the near future .",
    "the properties of exomoons can give us clues about the evolution of planet systems and deepen our understanding about the planet formation .",
    "especially , exomoons are good evidences to check the pps hypothesis .",
