    "recently many three - body @xmath0 decay modes have been observed with branching ratios of order @xmath14 .",
    "the dalitz plot analysis of 3-body @xmath0 decays provides a nice methodology for extracting information on the unitarity triangle in the standard model .",
    "the three - body meson decays are generally dominated by intermediate vector and scalar resonances , namely , they proceed via quasi - two - body decays containing a resonance state and a pseudoscalar meson .",
    "indeed , most of the quasi - two @xmath0 decays are extracted from the analysis of three - body @xmath0 decays using the dalitz plot technique .",
    "it is known that the nonresonant signal in charm decays is small , less than 10% @xcite . in the past few years , some of the charmless @xmath0 to 3-body decay modes",
    "have been measured at @xmath0 factories and studied using the dalitz plot analysis .",
    "we see from table [ tab : brexpt ] that the nonresonant fraction is about 90% in @xmath2 decays , @xmath15 measured by belle and 5% by babar in @xmath16 decays and 14% in the @xmath17 decay . hence , the nonresonant 3-body decays could play an essential role in @xmath0 decays . while this is a surprise in view of the rather small nonresonant contributions in 3-body charm decays , it is not entirely unexpected because the energy release scale in weak @xmath0 decays is of order 5 gev , whereas the major resonances lie in the energy region of 0.77 to 1.6 gev .",
    "consequently , it is likely that 3-body @xmath0 decays may receive sizable nonresonant contributions .",
    "we take the decay @xmath18 as an illustration . under the factorization approach ,",
    "its decay amplitude consists of three distinct factorizable terms : ( i ) the transition process induced by @xmath19 penguins , @xmath20 , ( ii ) the current - induced process through the tree @xmath21 transition , @xmath22 , and ( iii ) the annihilation process @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes a @xmath25 transition matrix element .      for the transition process",
    ", the general expression of the nonresonant contribution has the form @xmath26 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 . in principle",
    ", one can apply heavy meson chiral perturbation theory ( hmchpt ) to evaluate the form factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( for previous studies , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this will lead to too large decay rates in disagreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "a direct calculation indicates that the branching ratio of @xmath18 arising from the transition process alone is already at the level of @xmath30 which exceeds the measured total branching ratio @xcite of @xmath31 .",
    "the issue has to do with the applicability of hmchpt . in order to apply this approach , two of the final - state pseudoscalars (",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 in this example ) have to be soft .",
    "the momentum of the soft pseudoscalar should be smaller than the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath34 of order @xmath35 gev .",
    "for 3-body charmless @xmath0 decays , the available phase space where chiral perturbation theory is applicable is only a small fraction of the whole dalitz plot .",
    "therefore , it is not justified to apply chiral and heavy quark symmetries to a certain kinematic region and then generalize it to the region beyond its validity . if the soft meson result is assumed to be the same in the whole dalitz plot , the decay rate will be greatly overestimated .",
    "recently we propose to parametrize the @xmath21 trasnition - induced nonresonant amplitude given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ahmchpt ] ) as @xcite @xmath36 so that the hmchpt results are recovered in the chiral limit @xmath37 .",
    "that is , the nonresonant amplitude in the soft meson region is described by hmchpt , but its energy dependence beyond the chiral limit is governed by the exponential term @xmath38 .",
    "the unknown parameter @xmath39 can be determined from the data of the tree - dominated decay @xmath40 .",
    "experimentally , a phenomenological parametrization of the non - resonant @xmath2 amplitudes described by @xmath41 is adopted by both babar and belle .",
    "in addition to the @xmath21 tree transition , we need to consider the nonresonant contributions to the @xmath19 penguin amplitude @xmath42 the 2-kaon creation matrix elements can be expressed in terms of time - like kaon current form factors as @xmath43 the weak vector form factors @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be related to the kaon electromagnetic ( e.m . ) form factors @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the charged and neutral kaons , respectively .",
    "phenomenologically , the e.m .",
    "form factors receive resonant and nonresonant contributions @xmath48 the resonant and nonresonant terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kkemff ] ) can be determined from a fit to the kaon e.m .",
    "the non - resonant contribution to the matrix element @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 the nonresonant @xmath51 term is introduced for the following reason . although the nonresonant contributions to @xmath52 and @xmath53 are related through the equation of motion , the resonant ones are different and not related _ a priori_. as stressed in @xcite , to apply the equation of motion , the form factors should be away from the resonant region . in the presence of the resonances , we thus need to introduce a nonresonant @xmath51 term which can be constrained by the measured @xmath54 rate and the @xmath55 mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "vector meson and scalar resonances contribute to the two - body matrix elements @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "they can also contribute to the three - body matrix element @xmath58 .",
    "resonant effects are described in terms of the usual breit - wigner formalism .",
    "more precisely , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in this manner",
    "we are able to figure out the relevant resonances which contribute to the 3-body decays of interest and compute the rates of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we employ the decays @xmath18 and @xmath62 to fix the nonresonant parameter @xmath51 to be @xmath63 it turns out that the nonresonant contribution arises dominantly from the transition process ( 88% ) via the scalar - density - induced vacuum to @xmath64 transition , namely , @xmath65 , and slightly from the current - induced process ( 3% ) .",
    "physically , this is because the decay @xmath2 is dominated by the @xmath19 penguin transition .",
    "the nonresonant background in @xmath66 transition does not suffice to account for the experimental observation that the penguin - dominated decay @xmath2 is dominated by the nonresonant contributions .",
    "this implies that the two - body matrix element e.g. @xmath67 induced by the scalar density should have a large nonresonant component .",
    "we have considered other @xmath2 decays such as @xmath68 and @xmath69 and found that they are also dominated by the nonresonant contributions . our predicted branching ratio @xmath70 is in good agreement with the belle measurement of @xmath71 , but a factor of 2 smaller than the babar result of @xmath72 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the resonant and nonresonant contributions to the decay @xmath73 are shown in table [ tab : kpipi ] .",
    "we see that the calculated @xmath74 and @xmath75 rates are smaller than the data by a factor of @xmath76 .",
    "this seems to be a generic feature of the factorization approach such as qcd factorization where the predicted penguin - dominated @xmath77 rates are too small compared to experiment .",
    "we shall return back to this point later .    while belle has found a sizable fraction of order @xmath78 for the nonresonant signal in @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes , babar reported a small fraction of order 4.5% in @xmath4 ( see table [ tab : brexpt ] ) . the huge disparity between babar and belle",
    "is ascribed to the different parameterizations adopted by both groups . while belle @xcite employed the parametrization eq .",
    "( [ eq : anr ] ) to describe the nonresonant contribution , babar @xcite used the lass parametrization to describe the @xmath79 @xmath80-wave and the nonresonant component by a single amplitude suggested by the lass collaboration to describe the scalar amplitude in elastic @xmath79 scattering .",

    "the reason for the large nonresonant rates in the @xmath4 mode is that under su(3 ) flavor symmetry , we have the relation @xmath103 .",
    "hence , the nonresonant rates in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes should be similar to that in @xmath104 or @xmath105 . since the @xmath106 channel receives resonant contributions only from @xmath107 and @xmath108 mesons , while @xmath109 resonances contribute to @xmath110 modes",
    ", this explains why the nonresonant fraction is of order 90% in the former and becomes of order 40% in the latter .",
