    "the treatment of inelastic losses in x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) has long been of interest @xcite .",
    "two types of losses are identified .",
    "_ extrinsic _ losses occur during the propagation of the photoelectron , and are caused by the creation of excitations such as plasmons , electron - hole pairs , etc . _",
    "intrinsic _ losses refer to the creation of excitations by the sudden appearance of the core hole .",
    "the intrinsic losses are often called shake - up and shake - off excitations but are of the same type as the extrinsic , i.e.  plasmons , multi - electron excitations , etc .",
    "typically these excitations are observed only weakly in x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) .",
    "the extrinsic losses cause a decrease in intensity in the no - loss or primary channel , which is usually treated phenomenologically in terms of a mean - free path @xmath0 .",
    "owing to the difficulty of quantitative calculations , these additional losses have usually been neglected or represented as a constant amplitude factor , on the understanding that they only give some smooth background .",
    "the question of possible _ interference _ between extrinsic and intrinsic losses has long been unsettled .",
    "for photoemission spectroscopy , it has been shown @xcite that this interference is particularly important near excitation thresholds , where the losses strongly cancel .",
    "this cancellation results from the opposite signs of the coupling between the photoelectron and the core - hole to excited states of the valence electrons .",
    "in particular , for plasmon creation at threshold , only the long - wavelength plasmons appear which , due to momentum conservation , makes the recoil of the electron in the extrinsic losses small .",
    "the intrinsic losses are caused by coupling to the core hole , which can not recoil . as a result",
    "the extrinsic and intrinsic couplings become equal at threshold .",
    "the situation in xafs is less clear .",
    "fujikawa has discussed this cancellation using an explicit calculation of matrix elements and approximate closure relations @xcite .",
    "however , his discussion is limited to the vicinity of threshold , while we find that the cancellation effects extend over a wide energy region .",
    "in this paper we present a formal analysis of the loss problem , which is an extension of work by hedin and bardyszewski , together with numerical calculations to illustrate the theory .",
    "the results here are formulated in terms of an effective one - particle propagator which includes both inelastic losses and interference effects .",
    "this propagator contains an asymmetric quasi - particle peak plus a broad energy dependent satellite structure .",
    "our approach is essentially a generalization of the gw approximation which , in addition to extrinsic losses , treats _",
    "intrinsic _ losses and _ interference _ terms .",
    "the formalism also partly accounts for edge - singularity effects and contains corrections to the final state rule .",
    "although the cumulant expansion was successfully used to describe _ intrinsic _ losses in valence electron photoemission @xcite , we have found it more difficult to apply for x - ray absorption spectra . for photoemission ( pes ) the propagator for a hole and the spectral function @xmath1",
    "are needed , while in xas we need the propagator for a particle and the spectral function @xmath2 .",
    "the gw approximation for @xmath3 was discussed in ref .",
    "( p 87 , 92 ) .",
    "the satellite of the hole spectral function is very strong and sharp at the bottom of the band , but decreases in intensity and broadens as one approaches the fermi energy@xmath4 . at @xmath4 ,",
    "the satellite for the particle spectrum is similar to that for the hole spectrum , and it rapidly becomes weaker and broader with increasing energy above @xmath4 .",
    "the gw approximation places the satellite at about @xmath5 , rather than at @xmath6 away from the quasi - particle peak , as is predicted by the cumulant approximation , and born out by pes experiments @xcite .",
    "however , above the fermi level the difference between the gw and cumulant approximations is less pronounced .",
    "our formulation clarifies the nature of inelastic losses in xas and also yields semi - quantitative estimates of their effects , based on the electron gas approximation .",
    "in particular the theory yields an estimate for the reduction in the xafs amplitude due to inelastic losses in terms of a phasor summation over the spectral function .",
    "this results in an energy dependent reduction factor @xmath7 to the usual xafs formula , as well as an additional many - body phase shift .",
    "near the excitation threshold , we find that there is appreciable cancellation of strong extrinsic and intrinsic losses by the interference terms .",
    "correspondingly , the strength of the primary channel , i.e. , the main quasi - particle peak , increases near threshold .",
    "thus the theory also explains the surprising weakness of multi - electron excitations in the observed xas . at sufficiently high energies both the extrinsic and the interference contributions become negligible , and the theory crosses over to the sudden - approximation limit , where only intrinsic losses remain .",
    "our theory is illustrated for the case of cu metal .",
    "this system provides a good test case for our theory since errors in the conventional ms expansion and potentials are minimal and accurate experimental data is available @xcite .",
    "the x - ray absorption coefficient @xmath8 can be expressed formally in terms of the many - electron green s function @xmath9 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath12-particle ground state of the total system ( valence electrons and ion cores ) , @xmath13 the hamiltonian which fully includes electron - electron interactions , @xmath14 the ground state energy ( we consider for simplicity only the case when the temperature is zero ) , and @xmath15 the photon energy .",
    "we use atomic units @xmath16 , where lengths are in bohr radii ( 0.529 ) and energies in hartrees ( 27.2 ev ) .",
    "further @xmath17 is the dipole operator coupling the photon to the electronic system , and @xmath18 the inverse core hole lifetime .",
    "we have assumed that a specific core level @xmath19 on a specific atom is involved .    the standard way to proceed from eq .",
    "( [ mu1 ] ) is to insert a complete set of interacting states @xmath20 , which recovers the golden rule expression when we take @xmath21 as infinitesimal ; a finite @xmath18 just gives a lorentzian broadening , i.e. , @xmath22 this expression contains explicit final states @xmath23 in which the excited electron ( the photoelectron ) is correlated with the valence electrons .",
    "such states are very difficult to handle , so we instead take a different route which leads to an expression where no explicit final states are involved but instead , an expansion in one electron green s functions , as in conventional xas theory . our formulation , however , contains shake up effects and extrinsic inelastic losses as well as interference terms , and not just the damping in the elastic channel .",
    "some of the formal results derived here were presented previously in short conference reports @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have concentrated on the shake - up effects of the core hole potential and on the extrinsic losses of the ejected electron . to have a clean picture ,",
    "we have regarded the core electron as structureless .",
    "thus we have not considered interesting problems like core hole degeneracies and l@xmath24/l@xmath25 edges . such problems are in principle complicated kondo type problems .",
    "if we , however , limit the treatment to have an ion embedded in a solid state environment , and only consider the multiplet effects for the embedded ion @xcite , we think our treatment could straightforwardly be extended to this situation .",
    "we take for @xmath13 the standard `` deep - level '' hamiltonian discussed e.g. , by langreth @xcite ( cf .",
    "ref .  , pp 645 ) , @xmath26 here @xmath27 describes the electrons outside the ion cores , i.e. , the valence electrons and the photoelectron , and @xmath28 the interactions between the outer electrons and the core hole .",
    "this approximation neglects virtual excitations of the core electrons , but takes correlations among the outer electrons and the potential @xmath28 from the core hole fully into account .",
    "neglecting core - valence exchange we have explicitly , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the coulomb potential , and @xmath31 the charge density of the core electron state `` @xmath32 '' .",
    "the ground state of @xmath13 @xmath33 , is thus a product , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the correlated wave function for @xmath36 outer electrons and @xmath19  is the core electron wave function ,    @xmath37 the passive core electrons are not written out explicitly .",

    "this green s function is not of standard form since @xmath46 is an eigenfunction of @xmath27 and we have @xmath47 in the denominator .",
    "the theory developed so far is quite general , and can even account for losses , threshold singularity effects , and deviations from the `` final state rule , '' i.e. , the prescription that the xas is given by a one - electron expression with dipole matrix elements between the initial core and final state wave functions calculated in the presence of the core hole .",

    "these approximations , as discussed below , can be summed up in the quasi - boson representation described in sec .",
    "ii c.    to get a qualitative feeling for the properties of the transient green s function , we first discuss them in the hartree - fock approximation .",
