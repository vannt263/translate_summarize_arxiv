    "problems of adsorption on the surface of different bodies belong to a wide class of problems of physics , chemistry , and biology that are very important both from the theoretical point of view and for various practical applications .",
    "the results of numerous investigations show that adsorption of particles leads to considerable changes in physical and chemical characteristics of adsorbents .",
    "detailed analysis of the changes in the properties of the adsorbent surface due to adsorption is given , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "= -1    since processes of adsorption and desorption are obligatory stages of heterogeneous - catalytic reactions , the results of the adsorption theory are extremely important for investigation of various problems of heterogeneous catalysis @xcite . = -1    generalizations of the classical langmuir adsorption theory aimed at a more correct description of the adsorbent surface and adsorbed particles give the qualitatively new behavior of the amount of adsorbed substance and its kinetics . an extensive material obtained on the basis of different models and applications to various problems of adsorption and catalysis are widely presented in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "due to lateral interactions between adparticles , adsorption isotherms can have a hysteresis shape , and different structural changes in the adsorbent surface occur ( reviews of the theoretical and experimental results are given , e.g. , in @xcite ) . in turn ,",
    "a qualitative change in the surface structure in adsorption leads to a series of specific features of oscillatory surface reactions and formation of different spatiotemporal patterns ( for the oscillatory kinetics in heterogeneous catalysis and related problems , see , e.g. , the reviews @xcite and the monograph @xcite ) .",

    "it is worth noting that , as early as in 1938 , in @xcite , zeldovich based on the idea of a change in adsorption properties of the adsorbent surface in adsorption , predicted a hysteresis of adsorption isotherms if the typical time of adsorption and desorption is much less than the relaxation time of the surface .    in recent years",
    ", it has been established an essential influence of memory effects on the surface diffusion of adparticles over the adsorbent surface in the case where the relaxation time of the adsorbent is comparable ( or greater than ) with typical times for moving adparticles ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "dynamical changes in properties of the surface by moving particles are taken into account in some models ( e.g. , in @xcite ) , which , to some extent , is similar to the zeldovich idea of an absorbent varying its adsorption properties in adsorption .",
    "= -1    since an actual adsorbate includes several species of particles , in adsorption , particles of different species compete for adsorption sites .",
    "this leads not only to a decrease in the number of adparticles of a species relative to that for one - component adsorption @xcite but also to the qualitative change in the shape of adsorption isotherms with regard for lateral interactions between adparticles @xcite . in view of hysteresis - shaped isotherms of localized adsorption of a one - component gas on the flat surface of a solid adsorbent due to the adsorption - induced deformation of an adsorbent @xcite , it is of interest to investigate the influence of this factor on changes in the classical extended langmuir adsorption isotherms of a multicomponent gaseous system .",
    "= -1    in the present paper , we study specific features of adsorption isotherms of a two - component gas on the surface of a solid adsorbent whose adsorption properties vary in adsorption .    a model of adsorption of a two - component gas taking into account variations in adsorption properties of an adsorbent caused by its deformation in adsorption is proposed in sec .  2 .",
    "we obtain a system of equations that describes the kinetics of the surface coverage and the displacement of adsorption sites . for each species of adparticles , it is introduced the dimensionless coupling parameter equal to the normalized maximum increment of the activation energy for desorption due to the adsorbent deformation in one - component adsorption .",
    "the influence of the adsorbent deformation on the adsorption isotherms of adparticles of both species is investigated in sec .",
    "it is established a considerable redistribution of the amount of adsorbed substances as compared with that in the classical case even for a negligible quantity of particles of one species in a gas mixture .",
    "the obtained adsorption isotherms essentially depend on the coupling parameters and differ both from the langmuir adsorption isotherms of a two - component gas and from the adsorption isotherms of a one - component gas for an adsorbent whose adsorption properties vary in adsorption .",
    "we establish bistability and tristability of the system caused by variations in adsorption properties of the adsorbent in competitive adsorption .",
    "conditions under which adsorption isotherms of a binary gas mixture have two stable asymptotes are derived . in sec .  4 , within the framework of the overdamped approximation and essential difference in the linear relaxation times of the dynamical variables ,",
    "the behavior of the system under study is described in terms of a potential whose explicit form is obtained .",
    "the specific features of isotherms of competitive adsorption are explained with the use of the ( single- , two- , or three - well ) potential .",

    "desorption of gas particles @xcite .",
    "gas particles are adsorbed on adsorption sites located at the adsorbent surface and total number of sites @xmath0 does not change in time .",
    "all adsorption sites have equal adsorption activity ( energetically homogeneous surface ) and each adsorption site can be bound only with one gas particle .",
    "we introduce the cartesian coordinate system with the origin on the adsorbent surface and the @xmath1-axis directed into the adsorbent so that the adsorbent and the gas occupy the regions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we simulate each vacant adsorption site by a one - dimensional linear oscillator of mass @xmath4 that oscillates perpendicularly to the surface about its equilibrium position @xmath5 .",
    "= -1    the binding of a gas particle with an adsorption site is accompanied by a change in the spatial distribution of the charge density of the bound adsorption site as compared with that of a vacant one .",
    "this change depends on the nature of adsorption bonds and specific features of both the adsorbent and gas particles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "= -1    this leads to a change in the interaction of the bound adsorption site with neighboring atoms of the adsorbent located both on the surface and in the nearest subsurface region . as a result , the resulting force acting on the bound adsorption site changes as against that acting on the vacant adsorption site",
    "this can be regarded as the appearance of a certain adsorption - induced force @xmath6 acting on the adsorption site occupied by an adparticle of species @xmath7 ( here and below , the subscript @xmath7 denotes the species of particles ) , where @xmath8 is the running coordinate of the adsorption site . under the action of this force",
    ", the bound adsorption site tends to a new equilibrium position .",
    "however , as soon as the adparticle leaves the adsorption site , the last becomes vacant and relaxes to its nonperturbed equilibrium position @xmath5 . for the subsequent adsorption of other gas particle on this vacant adsorption site",
    ", two essentially different situations are possible : a gas particle occupies the site after or before it reaches the nonperturbed equilibrium position . in the first case",
    ", a new adparticle on the adsorption site does not `` fill '' its earlier occupation by previous adparticles . in the second ,",
    "a particle is adsorbed on the surface locally deformed by the previous adparticle ( not necessarily of the same species ) , i.e. , the retardation of relaxation of the surface occurs or , in other words , adsorption with memory takes place .",
    "= -1    we consider the case where the force @xmath6 is normal to the boundary and depends only on the coordinate @xmath9 :   @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the unit vector along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the force @xmath6 acts on the adsorption site only during discrete time intervals where the site is bound .",
    "thus , at any instant , the adsorption site is in one of the three states : vacant or bound with adparticle of species 1 or 2 .",
    "instead , we consider the approximation of a time - continuous adsorption - induced force @xmath12 , which corresponds to an adsorption site permanently bound with an adparticle with the time - dependent probability ( the mean occupancy of adparticle on an adsorption site ) equal to the surface coverage by adparticles of species @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of adsorption sites occupied by adparticles of species @xmath13 at the time @xmath16 . since an adsorption site can be bound only with one adparticle , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , and , hence , @xmath19 .",
    "this approximation is similar to the mean - field approximation used in the adsorption theory taking into account lateral interactions between adparticles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . expanding @xmath20 in the taylor series in the neighborhood of @xmath5 and keeping only the first term of the expansion , and expressing the adsorption - induced force @xmath21 in terms of the potential , @xmath22 , we get = -1 @xmath23 where    @xmath24 is the constant adsorption - induced force acting on the adsorption site occupied by an adparticle of species @xmath13 .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless quantity @xmath25 , which is positive or negative for parallel ( @xmath26 ) or antiparallel ( @xmath27 ) adsorption - induced forces , respectively .    disregarding the internal motions in the adparticle ",
    "adsorption site system , i.e. , considering the motion of the bound adsorption site as a whole , and taking into account a change in the mass of the oscillator in adsorption within the framework of this approximation , we obtain the following equation of motion of an oscillator of variable mass in the adsorption - induced force field : = -1 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the restoring force constant , @xmath30 is the friction coefficient , @xmath31 is the effective mass of the oscillator that varies in adsorption , @xmath32 is the mass of an adparticle of species @xmath13 , and the symbol @xmath33 denotes a collection of the surface coverages .",
    "since @xmath34 , the effective mass of the oscillator is lesser than @xmath35 .",
    "= -1    it follows from eq .",

    "the forces of lateral interactions between adparticles are parallel to the adsorbent surface and the adsorption - induced forces @xmath21 are perpendicular to the surface , which means that the forces @xmath21 are caused by the interaction of bound adsorption sites with the nearest subsurface atoms of the adsorbent .",

    "the hamiltonian of the adparticles  adsorbent system contains the term @xmath53 caused by the adsorbent deformation in adsorption due to the adsorption - induced force field @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that an adparticle of species @xmath13 is not only in a potential well of constant depth @xmath48 but also in the adsorption - induced potential @xmath55 . for parallel adsorption - induced forces , an adparticle of any species is in a deeper potential well than on a nondeformable adsorbent . as a result ,",
    "in the case at hand , for desorption of an adparticle of species @xmath13 , it must get an energy greater than @xmath48 by the value @xmath56 , which can be regarded as the increment of the activation energy for desorption @xmath48 of an adparticle of species @xmath13 caused by the adsorbent deformation . for antiparallel adsorption - induced forces , the increments @xmath57 of the activation energies for desorption @xmath48 of adparticles of different species @xmath13 have opposite signs .",
    "thus , the adsorbent deformation increases the activation energy for desorption of adparticles of one species and decreases the activation energy for desorption of adparticles of another species .",
    "note that the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath58 can be interpreted as the first and second terms , respectively , of the taylor series of the coordinate - dependent activation energy for desorption @xmath59 .",
    "= -1    it is well known that lateral interactions between adparticles essentially change adsorption isotherms of a binary gas mixture ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present paper , to illustrate that there is another factor ( the adsorption - induced deformation of the adsorbent ) leading to qualitative changes in isotherms of competitive adsorption of a two - component gas , we do not take into account lateral interactions between adparticles .",
    "the adsorbent deformation in adsorption affects the desorption rates of adparticles and , hence , the surface coverage . assuming that the pre - exponential factors @xmath50 are not changed , we obtain the following expression for the rate coefficients for desorption : @xmath60 thus , the rate coefficients for desorption ( 5 ) are",
    "coordinate - dependent functions , and gas particles are adsorbed on the surface whose adsorption characteristics vary with time .",
    "according to ( 5 ) , for @xmath61 , the desorption rates of adparticles of both species decrease due to the adsorbent deformation in adsorption .",
    "for @xmath62 , the joint action of adparticles of both species on the adsorbent leads to the opposite results : the desorption rate of adparticles decreases for one species and increases for another .",
    "with regard for variations in adsorption properties of the adsorbent in adsorption , the kinetics of the surface coverages is described by the equations @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the concentration of particles of species @xmath13 in the gas phase that is kept constant , @xmath65 is the vacant part of the surface , @xmath66 is the surface coverage by adparticles of both species , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are , respectively , the numbers of occupied and vacant adsorption sites at the time @xmath16 , @xmath69 .",

    "the specific features of adsorption isotherms ( bistability and tristability of the system , two stable asymptotes of adsorption isotherms , an essential redistribution of the quantities of adsorbed particles of different species as compared with those in the classical case ) depend on values of the parameters expressed in terms of the phenomenological constant adsorption - induced forces @xmath107 and @xmath105 .",
