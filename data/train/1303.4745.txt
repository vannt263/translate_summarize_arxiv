    "a breakdown of the standard moriya - hertz - millis  @xcite model of itinerant magnetic criticality occurs as the quantum critical point becomes occluded by new fluctuation - driven phases . magnetic fluctuations transverse to the polarization drive many materials to display a first order ferromagnetic transition  @xcite , spatially modulated magnetic order  for example cefepo  @xcite , nbfe@xmath0  @xcite , yb(rh@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath4si@xmath0  @xcite and possibly sr@xmath5ru@xmath0o@xmath6  @xcite , or higher angular momentum particle - hole pairing  @xcite .",

    "near to the itinerant ferromagnetic quantum critical point the electron gas forms a previously unknown phase , a pair density wave where the magnetic order forms a spiral modulation coexistent with a larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell - like spatial modulation of the d - vector of a p - wave superconductor  @xcite .     as a function of temperature and interaction strength .",

    "the essence of our order - by - disorder approach is to expand the free energy in fluctuations about some putative order .",
    "the order modifies the electron dispersion and so the energy of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "this offers an alternative , physical view of the non - analytic corrections that overturn moriya - hertz - millis theory leading to the opportunity to undergo a first order transition  @xcite , spatially modulated magnetism  @xcite , a nematic phase  @xcite , and p - wave superconductivity  @xcite . near to the quantum critical point the fluctuations self - consistently stabilize the ordered state .",
    "this mechanism is similar in spirit , but subtly different in details , to several others : the coleman - weinberg mechanism of field theory  @xcite , quantum order - by - disorder  @xcite , and the casimir effect  @xcite . from the latter perspective",

    "we first revisit the quantum - by - disorder approach demonstrating how transverse magnetic fluctuations can generate a spatially modulated magnetic phase and extend the analytical formalism to apply near zero temperature .",
    "secondly , we introduce a superconducting instability driven by longitudinal spin fluctuations into the formalism and elucidate the phase diagram .",
    "finally , we discuss the consequences of the intertwined spiral and superconducting instabilities for experimental systems .",
    "we first review the order - by - disorder approach to address the magnetic phase diagram ignoring any possible superconducting instabilities .",
    "our starting point is a hamiltonian of freely dispersing electrons with @xmath11 interacting through a contact repulsion @xmath7 reflecting the screened coulomb interaction present in metals @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the fermion occupancy in momentum space , @xmath14 in real space , spin @xmath15 , and we adopt atomic units with @xmath16 throughout .",
    "this model shows a continuous ferromagnetic transition in mean - field , the zero - temperature terminus of which hertz termed the quantum critical point  @xcite .",
    "hertz realized that quantum fluctuations could modify the critical behavior at this quantum critical point , however it has recently been shown that fluctuations can have an even more dramatic effect , reconstructing the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the analysis of these effects proceeds as follows : first we consider a background spiral magnetization , @xmath17 that modifies the mean - field electron dispersion @xmath18 .",

    "good agreement with variational monte carlo calculations  @xcite encourages us to develop a more amenable ginzburg - landau expansion near to the tricritical point  @xcite .",
    "the free energy is a functional of the mean - field dispersion in the presence of the modulated order parameter , @xmath27 = \\langle{\\cal f}[m^2+\\theta^2q^2 ] \\rangle - \\langle{\\cal f}[\\theta^2q^2 ] \\rangle$ ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 indicates an angular average . in a taylor expansion of the free energy in @xmath30 and @xmath31 , terms",

    "the leading fluctuation contribution , @xmath38 is accompanied by higher order terms proportional to @xmath39 , @xmath40 _ etc_. these occur with pre - factors allowing them to be re - summed exactly to give the following contribution to the free energy @xmath41 { \\,,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the density of states at the fermi surface and @xmath42 is the euler constant .",

    "we find that they enhance the region of the phase diagram occupied by the spiral phase making it consistent with the broader region seen in variation monte carlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , re - summation of these sub - leading divergences does not yield a simple analytical form and we have not included them here .",
    "we now wish to incorporate the possibility of cooper pairing .",
    "we focus upon a1 type pairing of spin - up electrons into a p - wave state  @xcite , as it is the most favorable given the background magnetic order .",
    "other pairing symmetries can be treated similarly .",
    "the superconducting order overlaps with the fluctuation - induced spiral modulation so we must construct superconducting order that can be treated self - consistently in the order - by - disorder scheme . the natural choice is a p - wave state in the basis that is diagonal in the presence of the background spiral , _",
    "i.e. _ in the basis where electron spins are polarized locally parallel or anti - parallel with the background spiral order .",
    "this leads to a state in which the d - vector of the p - wave superconductor rotates in concert with the magnetization .",
    "the state may be referred to as a pair density wave as it involves modulation of both magnetic and superconducting order , or alternatively larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell - like since it involves a modulation of the superconducting order parameter , but in its su(2 ) rather than u(1 ) sector .",
    "as it stands , the quantum order by disorder procedure requires that the emergent order changes the mean - field dispersion . in the case of a contact repulsion",
    ", superconductivity does not have this effect .",
    "one way around this ( used to study the possibility of nematic order in @xcite ) is to include a field conjugate to the superconducting order . after calculating the appropriate free energy and its fluctuation corrections , a legendre transformation recovers the gibbs free energy . here",
    ", we use an equivalent self - consistent approach .",
    "the general scheme is as follows : i. after having first diagonalized the electron states in the magnetic background , we add and subtract a term @xmath43 in the free energy , where @xmath44 creates a state with spin polarized parallel to the background magnetic order , which may be spiral in certain regions of the phase diagram .",
    "the terms @xmath45 can be diagonalized by a bogoliubov transformation .",
    "the contributions of the terms @xmath46 can be calculated perturbatively in the bogoliubov basis .",
