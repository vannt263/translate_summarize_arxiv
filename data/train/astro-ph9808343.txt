    "we have completed the analysis of the data for the first field of this survey , which is 2 x 7.3  arcmin@xmath0 field at j005325 + 1234 .",
    "the sample is selected ignoring morphology at @xmath7 and consists of the 195 objects with @xmath8 mag in this field .",
    "these were observed with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( oke _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) at the keck observatory .",
    "six color photometry ( @xmath9 ) is available for the entire field as well from pahre _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "redshifts were successfully obtained for 163 of the 195 objects in the sample to achieve a completeness of 84% .",
    "these redshifts lie in the range [ 0.173 , 1.44 ] and have a median of 0.58 ( excluding 24 spectroscopically confirmed galactic stars ) .",
    "the sample includes two broad lined agns and one qso .",
    "the objects are assigned to spectral classes based on the relative preponderance of emission lines versus absorption lines in their spectra .",
    "the four spectral classes used for extragalactic objects are `` @xmath10 '' for emission line dominated spectra ( 33 galaxies ) , `` @xmath11 '' for absorption line dominated spectra ( 51 galaxies ) , `` @xmath12 '' for composite spectra ( 52 galaxies ) , and `` @xmath13 '' for agns .",
    "a few starbursts were found , classified as `` @xmath14 '' , but for the present discussion they are grouped together with the emission line galaxies .",
    "the galaxy rest frame seds derived from out @xmath9 photometry are very closely correlated to the galaxy spectral types",
    ". both are also correlated with galaxy luminosity ; blue galaxies show the signature of recent star formation in their spectra and are less luminous for @xmath15 than red galaxies which show no evidence for recent star formation in their spectra .",
    "representative seds are shown in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "the seds for selected galaxies ( d0k183 , 172 , 108 , 188 and 158 ) with @xmath16 shown in figure  1a are remarkably flat ( blue ) .",
    "figure  1b shows the seds for all the absorption line galaxies in the @xmath17 peak ; they have quite steep ( red ) spectra .",
    "there are 24 galactic stars in this sample , mostly m dwarfs or m subdwarfs .",
    "the reddest galactic star identified spectroscopically in this field has @xmath18 mag .",
    "there are 19 objects in this sample with @xmath2 mag , which we call the very red objects , and which we believe to be galaxies rather than galactic stars .",
    "four of these have redshifts , most of which are somewhat uncertain . figure  [ fig-2 ] shows the rest frame seds for the four very red galaxies with redshifts .",
    "the second panel of figure  [ fig-2 ] shows the seds for three of the very red objects which do not have redshifts , calculated assuming @xmath19 .",
    "redder than @xmath20 , these look similar to those seds shown in the first panel of this figure , but the objects are somewhat fainter .",
    "most of the @xmath21 and @xmath20 magnitudes for these objects are upper limits , as indicated by the vertical bars going downward from the relevant points .    a more complete discussion of the redshift peaks ( i.e. groups and poor clusters of galaxies ) , luminosity function , the cosmological volume density , the constraints on mergers , the ultraviolet extinction and other issues can be found in two papers , one of which has been submitted to  ( cohen _ et al._1998a ) while the other ( cohen _ et al . _",
    "1998b ) will be published in .",
    "we have determined the fraction of very red objects among our sample . for counts to @xmath8 mag ,",
    "@xmath610% of the sample of 195 objects is very red , i.e. has @xmath2 mag .",
    "if one excludes the known galactic stars from the sample , this fraction does not change substantially .",
    "we have examined the spectra of many of these extremely red objects and have succeeded in determining the redshifts of four of them , although the redshifts are not as certain as one might desire .",
    "we suggest that these are galaxies with @xmath4 in which reddening by dust is not playing a major role .",
    "in particular they are not heavily reddened starbursts .",
    "( if they were , we should have seen some moderately reddened emission line galaxies , and there were no such beasts among our sample ) .",
    "instead we believe their extremely red colors are a direct consequence of their age , stellar composition , k - corrections , etc . and that these extremely red objects are the analogs at this redshift range of local elliptical galaxies .",
    "we thus support persson _ et al . _  ( 1993 ) and",
    "graham & dey ( 1996 ) , who among others , have speculated that such objects are passively - evolved elliptical galaxies with @xmath22 .",
    "the entire keck / lris user community owes a huge debt to jerry nelson , gerry smith , bev oke , and many other people who have worked to make the keck telescope and lris a reality .",
    "we are grateful to the w. m. keck foundation , and particularly its late president , howard keck , for the vision to fund the construction of the w. m. keck observatory .",
    "jgc is grateful for partial support from stsci / nasa grant ar-06337.12 - 94a .",
