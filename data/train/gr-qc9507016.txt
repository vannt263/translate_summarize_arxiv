    "gravity seems to enjoy a remarkable universality property : all bodies are experimentally found to fall with the same acceleration in an external gravitational field , independently of their mass and composition .",
    "although galileo @xcite was the first @xcite to suggest in a clear and general way that this property of universality of free fall might hold true , it was left to newton @xcite to realize the remarkable conceptual status of this universality : exact proportionality between a particular force ( the weight ) and the general dynamical measure of inertia ( the mass ) .",
    "newton went further in performing the first precise laboratory tests of the universality of free fall ( pendulum experiments ; precision @xmath3 ) .",
    "it is less well known that newton went even further and suggested to test the universality of free fall of celestial bodies by looking for a possible miscentering of the orbits of satellites around jupiter , saturn and the earth @xcite .",
    "more precisely , newton considers a possible violation of the ratio weight ( @xmath4 ) over mass ( @xmath5 ) , i.e. @xmath6 where @xmath7 labels a satellite and @xmath8 a planet , the weights @xmath9 being the gravitational forces exerted by the sun ( label @xmath10 ) .",
    "he says , without giving any details , that he has found `` by some computations '' that the center @xmath11 of the orbit of the satellite @xmath7 around the planet @xmath8 will be displaced ( in the sun - planet direction and away from the sun if @xmath12 ) by the amount @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the radius of the orbit of the planet @xmath8 around the sun . in modern phraseology , one can say that newton predicted a `` polarization '' of the satellite s orbit in the sun - planet direction ( away from the sun if @xmath15 ) .",
    "then newton used his theoretical estimate ( [ 1two ] ) to conclude from the observed good centering of the orbits of the satellites of jupiter that @xmath16 , a number comparable to the result of his pendulum experiments . actually , this upper limit obtained from jovian satellites is wrong , as newton s theoretical estimate ( [ 1two ] ) is incorrect both in magnitude ( being a gross overestimate in general ) and in sign ( see below ) .",
    "we could not find any information about newton s original calculations in his published papers .",
    "it is surprising that newton did not remark that , as a consequence of his estimate ( [ 1two ] ) , a value @xmath17 would also entail an unacceptably large polarization ( one fifth ) of the moon s orbit .    as far as we are aware , laplace was the first to realize that the best celestial system to test a possible violation of the universality of free fall ( [ 1one ] ) is the earth - moon system ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "in @xcite he derived a rough estimate of the main observable effect of @xmath20 on the angular motion of the moon .",
    "then , he noticed that even a very small @xmath21 would spoil the agreement linking his theoretical derivation of the `` parallactic inequality '' of the moon , the set of observations of the lunar motion , and the direct measurements of the solar parallax .",
    "he concluded that an upper bound to the fractional difference in acceleration of the moon and the earth toward the sun is @xmath22    it is remarkable that the limit ( [ 1three ] ) is much better than the limit ( @xmath23 ) obtained some years later by bessel through improved pendulum experiments @xcite , and has been superseded ( though not by much ) only by the work of etvs in 1890 ( @xmath24 ; @xcite ) .",
    "[ the later results of etvs , pekr and fekete improved the bound to @xmath25 ; @xcite . ]",
    "as we discuss in appendix  d , in spite of some obscurities in his reasonings and the lack of a fully accurate calculation of the effect of @xmath20 in longitude , laplace s final bound ( [ 1three ] ) turns out to be a conservative upper limit , given the information he had .    in 1907 , einstein @xcite deepened the conceptual implications of the property of universality of free fall by raising it to the level of a `` hypothesis of complete physical equivalence '' between a gravitational field and an accelerated system of reference .",
    "this heuristic hypothesis was used very successfully by einstein in his construction of the theory of general relativity , and became later enshrined in the name `` principle of equivalence '' .    within the context of relativistic gravitational theories , the use of the moon as a sensitive probe of a possible violation of the equivalence principle for massive , self - gravitating bodies has been rediscovered by nordtvedt in 1968 @xcite .",

    "armed with our theoretical understanding of the @xmath5-dependence of the @xmath32 oscillation , we suggest other orbits that might be practically interesting ( retrograde orbits , orbits around outer planets ) .",
    "finally , we emphasize that within the context of modern unified theories the most probable theoretical significance of _ orbital _ tests of the universality of free fall is the same as that of _ laboratory _ tests , namely to measure , through composition - dependent effects , the strength of the coupling to matter of some long range scalar field(s ) . the basic measure of this coupling strength is embodied in an effective eddington parameter @xmath67 which governs both the standard post - newtonian effects ( including the violation of the strong equivalence principle @xmath68 ) and the composition - dependent couplings ( violation of the weak equivalence principle ) .",

    "if @xmath649 $ ] , @xmath650 will have the form @xmath651 $ ] . in other words , @xmath652 , so that the perturbing potentials @xmath182 , @xmath189 , @xmath348 , @xmath138 generate source terms with @xmath653 , @xmath654 , @xmath655 , @xmath138 , respectively .",
    "in the first volume of his _ trait de mcanique cleste _ @xcite ( presented to the french academy of sciences in 1799 ) , laplace lists a series of facts suggesting that gravity is proportional to the masses . this list ( which is probably inspired by a corresponding list in the _ principia _ , although laplace does not mention newton here ) contains newton s argument that the motion of satellites would be very sensitive to a violation of the universality of free fall , but does not quantify it . as far as we are aware , the only quantitative work of laplace on this idea @xcite is contained in the last book of the last volume of the _ trait de mcanique cleste _ which was presented to the acadmie des sciences on 16 august 1825 @xcite .",
    "the fact that laplace was then @xmath656 year old ( he died a year and a half later on 5 march 1827 ) may explain why this work of laplace contains some strange leaps of reasoning % and then goes on to admit @xmath657 % as fractional upper limit on the theory / observation agreement . ] .",
    "it seems plausible to us that laplace , when writing this chapter , was using previous notes of his which contained more detailed calculations and more consistent reasonings .",
    "anyway , the aim of this appendix is to show that the final limit he quotes on a possible violation of the equivalence principle , @xmath658 is a very reasonable ( and slightly pessimistic ) bound , which can be derived in a logically clear way using only the information laplace had in hand .",
    "laplace s new idea ( compared to newton ) was to use the `` parallactic inequality '' in the longitude of the moon as a sensitive test of the equivalence principle .",
    "`` parallactic inequality '' means the coefficient of the synodic term @xmath659 in the expression of the lunar longitude @xmath449 as a function of time . ] .",
    "we have computed this coefficient , say @xmath115 , in appendices  a and b for the main problem ( i.e. neglecting eccentricities and inclinations ) .",
    "its theoretical expression reads @xmath660 where the normal `` parallactic '' contribution reads @xmath661 while the `` equivalence principle '' one reads @xmath662 here , @xmath663 , @xmath664 , are slowly converging series in powers of @xmath665 . in the third volume of his _ trait de mcanique cleste _ , laplace computes @xmath666 with particular care , pushing the calculation to fifth order in @xmath5 inclusively .",
    "he was therefore entitled to considering that the theoretical error on @xmath666 was negligible compared to the observational uncertainties in @xmath667 .",
    "note that @xmath666 is proportional to the inverse distance to the sun , i.e. to the `` solar parallax '' @xmath668 , where @xmath669 is the equatorial radius of the earth ( hence the name `` parallactic inequality '' ) .",
    "the result of laplace can be expressed as @xmath670 where both @xmath666 and @xmath671 are expressed in seconds of arc of a right angle . ] .    on the observational side , laplace had in hand both lunar data and data on the solar parallax .",
    "the two phenomenological `` lunar tables '' he was using ( one by mason and one by burg ) gave for the `` observed '' value of the synodic inequality in longitude , @xmath672 and @xmath673 @xcite . as for the solar parallax ,",
    "many scientific expeditions had taken advantage of the passages of venus in front of the sun in 1761 and , especially , 1769 to measure @xmath671 ( see @xcite for a detailed text by a contemporary of laplace , or @xcite for a more exhaustive historical treatment ) .",
    "the published results ranged between @xmath674 ( planman ) and @xmath675 ( pingr ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the theoretical results ( [ dtwo ] ) , ( [ dfive ] ) and the observational results on @xmath115 and @xmath671 gives a value for a possible equivalence - principle - violation contribution @xmath676    worst - case limits on @xmath677 are obtained by taking the extreme values on the right - hand side of ( [ dsix ] ) ( e.g. @xmath678 ) .",
    "this yields @xmath679 on the other hand , the theoretical result ( [ dfour ] ) [ using @xmath680 and @xmath681 ( see appendix  b ) ] reads @xmath682 in seconds of arc , so that we get the following worst - case bounds on @xmath20 @xmath683 from this point of view , the final bound quoted by laplace , eq .",
    "( [ done ] ) , seems very reasonable and consistent with the observational uncertainties in his time .",
    "note , however , that laplace never quotes a precise theoretical formula for @xmath677 .",
    "he only says ( and uses ) the fact that the synodic amplitude @xmath115 is proportional to its source term in the perturbing function .",
    "this neglects the leading `` @xmath467 dependence '' of @xmath684 in eq .",
    "( [ anineteenb ] ) which says that @xmath685 . in laplace",
    "s published analysis the lacking ( unfavourable ) factor @xmath686 is effectively compensated by his overpessimistic estimate of the fractional uncertainty on @xmath115 : @xmath657 % , i.e. the ratio @xmath687 laplace s experience with similar factors in many terms of lunar theory might have suggested him that he did not need to worry about it . ] .",
    "let us end this section by raising a historical question .",
    "though laplace was fully aware of the scientific interest of the bound ( [ done ] ) , and of the fact that it was ( at the time ) more precise than the bounds obtained from ground tests of the universality of free fall , his successors in celestial mechanics seem ( as far as we know ) to have lost interest in the issue . however , near the end of the nineteenth century , especially after the theoretical work of hansen , delaunay , hill and brown ( who improved the computation of @xmath688 ) , and after many improvements on the observational side , it should have been possible to obtain more stringent limits on @xmath20",
    "for instance , delaunay computed @xmath688 to @xmath361 which corresponds to a truncature error of @xmath689 @xcite ( for the principal part of @xmath115 ; see also appendix  b ) .",
    "this is negligible ( when added in quadrature ) compared to the observational error on @xmath671 at the time .",
    "for instance , the laboratory measurements of the velocity of light by foucault and cornu gave values ranging between @xmath690 and @xmath691 , the passage of venus across the solar disk in 1874 gave a range @xmath692 @xcite , and the recommended value starting in 1896 was @xmath693 .",
    "this suggests that a reasonable upper bound on the uncertainty of @xmath671 at that time was @xmath694 ( i.e. @xmath695 % ) .",
    "[ by comparison , the modern value is @xmath696 @xcite . ] on the other hand , the observational error on @xmath667 at the time was @xmath697 , i.e. @xmath698 % ( see @xcite , p.  533 ) .",
    "this has a negligible effect on the derivation of a bound on @xmath71 entering @xmath666 . ] . using eq .",
    "( [ dsix ] ) with @xmath699 seconds of arc , this leads to the bound @xmath700 , which is slightly better than the value obtained by etvs in 1890 ( @xmath701 @xcite ) .",
    "we do not wish to take too seriously such _ a posteriori _ derivations of limits on @xmath20 , but we consider this as an interesting example of historical eclipse of a deep concept , which has been rejuvenated , within a new theoretical and observational context , only in the last decades .    on leave from the institute of astronomy , charles university , vdsk 8 , 15000 prague 5 , czech republic ( e - mail : davok@aci.cvut.cz ) .",
