    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , powered by black hole ( bh ) accretion with bhs of @xmath4 at the center of galaxies , are thought to be scaled - up versions of black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) @xcite .",
    "a compelling line of evidence for this postulation is the striking similarity in the variability of the x - ray radiation between agns and bhxbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one characteristic and enigmatic feature of the variable x - rays is quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) , which has been observed in the x - ray light curves of dozens of bhxbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray qpos were found to have two types , low - frequency qpos ( lfqpos ) and high - frequency qpos ( hfqpos ) ( @xcite , hereafter rm06 ) .",
    "hfqpos sometimes occur in pairs with a constant frequency ratio of 3:2 , and unlike lfqpos , their frequencies ( @xmath5 ) are stable despite significant variations in fluxes @xcite .",
    "this indicates that hfqpo is likely a fundamental property that might be linked to the mass ( and spin ) of the bh .",
    "based on only three bhxbs with measured bh masses , rm06 suggested an inverse linear relation between @xmath5 and bh mass , which was later extended to intermediate - mass bh ( imbh ) in ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) by @xcite .",
    "a number of hfqpo models have been proposed in the literature ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews and references therein ) .    in agns with supermassive bhs ( smbhs ) , however , qpos are rarely detected .",
    "so far , there is only one widely accepted case in which a significant qpo was unambiguously detected in the narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxy re  j1034 + 396 with @xmath6hz @xcite .",
    "recently , a @xmath7s x - ray qpo was detected in the transient x - ray source swift  j164449.3 + 573451 , thought to be of tidal disruption of a star by a dormant smbh @xcite . by extending bh masses to the smbh range",
    ", @xcite suggested that the @xmath8 scaling relation is universal spanning @xmath9 orders of magnitude from stellar - mass bhs to smbhs .    besides re  j1034 + 396 , possible detections of x - ray qpos",
    "were also reported in a few other agns , however , at relatively low levels of significance . a @xmath10hr qpo in 2xmm  j123103.2 + 110648",
    "was reported and suggested to be a lfqpo @xcite , and a @xmath11hr hfqpo was also reported in ms  2254.9 - 3712 @xcite .    in this letter , we report on the discovery of a significant qpo signal in one _ xmm - newton _ observation of 1h  0707 - 495 , a nearby ( redshift 0.04 ) , typical nls1 @xcite .",
    "we also re - examine the bh mass of 1h  0707 - 495 by analysing its available optical spectroscopic data , and compare the qpo with the @xmath8 relation .",
    "a cosmology with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is adopted .",
    "1h  0707 - 495 was observed with _ xmm - newton _ with an exposure of @xmath15ks on february 6 2008 in the full frame imaging mode ( obs",
    "i d : 0511580401 ) .",
    "we follow the standard procedure to reduce the data and extract science products from the observation data files ( odfs ) using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas , version 13.0.0 ) .",
    "only good events ( single and double pixel events , i.e. pattern @xmath16 4 for pn or @xmath16 12 for mos ) are used .",
    "source events are extracted from a 40-arcsec circular region , and background events from a source - free circle with the same radius on the same ccd chip .",
    "x - ray light curves are constructed for all the three epic detectors in the 0.2 - 10kev energy band with a binsize of 100s , and are corrected for instrumental factors using epiclccorr .",
    "the combined pn+mos1+mos2 light curve is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . even by eye",
    ", a periodicity can be clearly seen .",
    "we search for periodicity by calculating the root - mean - square ( rms ) amplitudes of the light curve folded with various periods as a function of period .",
    "a strong peak appears at around 3800s .",
    "it is also found that this peak is the strongest if the latter half of the light curve is used only , with a quasi - period of @xmath17s ( full - width at half - maximum ) .",
    "we thus take an operational cut as indicated in figure [ fig1 ] ( solid vertical line ) and consider the last @xmath18ks segment only hereafter , in order to achieve the highest confidence level for the periodic signal .",
    "this segment has a mean count rate of 6.1countss@xmath19 and fractional rms variability 41% , while the whole light curve gives 6.7countss@xmath19 and 37% , respectively . the folded light curve with a period 3800s is also showed in figure [ fig1 ] ( inset ) , with the best - fit sinusoid model .",
    "the power spectrum density ( psd ) of the light curve is computed as the modulus - squared of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , and the ( rms / mean)@xmath20 normalisation is chosen @xcite .",
    "the psd for the last 55ks segment is plotted in figure [ fig2 ] , and a strong peak at @xmath21hz is evident . the continuum ( red noise )",
    "is well fitted with a power - law of a slope @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , in the log - log space ) .",
    "this signal is even more prominent in the residuals plot ( data / model ) . to test its statistical significance",
    ", a monte carlo technique is applied following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we simulate one million light curves using the method of @xcite from a psd , which is assumed to be the above best - fit power - law .",
    "thus the distribution of the variability power at each fourier frequency can be obtained from the psds of the simulated light curves . the dashed line in figure [ fig2 ] represents the 99.99% significance level , indicating a significant qpo . using the data of pn camera and the combined mos cameras individually leads to the same result with the qpo significance levels @xmath0 in both cases .    to test the qpo in re  j1034 + 396",
    ", @xcite used a method developed by @xcite .",
    "this method was later improved significantly by @xcite to be an even more stringent test based on bayesian statistics , in combination with psd fitting .",
    "we also adopt this improved method here . instead of a simple power - law ( @xmath24 model ) , a bending power - law ( @xmath25 model )",
    "is used to fit the psd continuum .",
    "the low - frequency slope is fixed at -1 , while the high - frequency slope is fitted to be @xmath26 , with a bending frequency of @xmath27hz .",
    "then markov chain monte carlo simulations are performed , resulting a small posterior predictive @xmath28-value of @xmath29 for the significant outlier at the frequency @xmath30hz [ @xmath31 for the pn light curve and @xmath32 for the combined mos light curve , respectively ] .",
    "this strongly indicates the presence of the qpo .",
    "this periodicity of @xmath30hz is highly coherent and confined to only one frequency bin in our analysis . considering the frequency resolution for the observation ( @xmath33hz ) ,",
    "the quality factor ( @xmath1 ) is high .",
    "the rms fractional variability in the qpo is @xmath2 .",
    "compared to the rare previously reported qpos in agns in the literature , the qpo in 1h  0707 - 495 has a significance level at least similar to or even higher than most of the others but only somewhat lower than that in re  j1034 + 396.-value for re  j1034 + 396 is @xmath34 , if only the second segment of its light curve is used , following @xcite . ] the significance of this qpo would be reduced to @xmath35 if the whole observation duration is considered .",
    "we also analyzed data of other 14 _ xmm - newton _ observations of 1h  0707 - 495 with exposure time longer than 40ks , but no significant qpo is found .",
    "thus the qpo appears to be a transient feature ; similar to that found in re  j1034 + 396 @xcite",
    "using the empirical virial method based on optical spectroscopic data , the bh mass of 1h  0707 - 495 has been estimated in previous studies , as @xmath36 from a 6df spectrum @xcite and @xmath37 @xcite from ctio spectrum taken by @xcite .",
    "we re - analyze both the spectra , following the procedure as described in @xcite to fit the optical spetra .",
    "only the ctio spectrum is shown in figure [ fig3 ] for demonstration .",
    "the flux of the 6df spectrum is calibrated using the ctio spectrum .",
    "the continuum is modeled with a power law and the fe  ii emission is modeled using the @xcite templates .",
    "the balmer lines are deblended into a broad and a narrow component , and the former is modeled with a lorentzian profile .",
    "the narrow component is modeled by a gaussian with fwhm fixed at the ctio spectral resolution ( @xmath38330kms@xmath19 , @xcite ) .",
    "the flux ratio of the [ oiii]@xmath394959,5007 doublet is fixed at the theoretical value of 1:3 while each of them is fitted with two gaussians , one for the line core with fwhm fixed to the narrow balmar line widths , the other for the blueshifted wing .",
    "the widths of the broad h@xmath40 line are fitted to be 1002kms@xmath19 ( ctio ) and 1054kms@xmath19 ( 6df ) , which agree with each other within mutual errors .",
    "the narrowness of the broad h@xmath40 line , as well as the strong fe  ii emission are characteristic of nls1 agn .",
    "the bh mass is estimated using the broad h@xmath40 line width and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100  ( @xmath41ergs@xmath19 ) @xcite , giving @xmath42 ( ctio ) and @xmath43 ( 6df ) , respectively .",
    "the continuum modeled with a power - law is plotted in green . the best - fit fe  ii emission is represented by the lower black curve .",
    "the residual emission line spectra ( black line ) after subtracting the power - law continuum and the fe  ii model is shown in the insets for the h@xmath44[oiii ] and h@xmath45 regions , respectively ( red : broad lines ; blue : narrow lines ) .",
    "see text for details .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    given the large uncertainty @xmath46dex of this method @xcite , the estimated bh mass is consistent with previous results .",
    "we consider our spectral analysis to be more comprehensive and rigorous compared to those in previous work , and thus @xmath47 to be the best - estimate of the bh mass in 1h0707@xmath48495 .",
    "adopting a bolometric luminosity of @xmath49ergs@xmath19 estimated from @xmath50 @xcite , the eddington ratio is 0.5 , which is typical of nls1 .    by extending the @xmath8 relation from stellar-/intermediate - mass bh to the smbh regime , @xcite suggested it to be a universal relationship for astrophysical bhs at all mass scales . in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , we reproduce the @xmath8 relation derived by rm06 based on three bhxbs ( solid line ) and overplot 1h  0707 - 495 , as well as those bh systems with known qpos ( see table 1 in @xcite ) . clearly , the qpo in 1h  0707 - 495 conforms with the @xmath8 relation within the bh mass uncertainty range .    .",
    "a significant qpo signal is detected at a @xmath0 confidence level in one of the x - ray light curves of the nls1 agn 1h  0707 - 495 taken with _",
    "xmm - newton_. the qpo frequency ( @xmath30hz ) and the estimated mass of the central bh ( @xmath51 ) conform with the previous @xmath8 relation .",
    "we note that the same data set was also analyzed by @xcite in a study of the x - ray timing properties of a large sample of agn , but no significant qpo was reported .",
    "this might be ascribed to that the data of the whole observation duration was used in their work , which led to reduced significance of the signal ( @xmath35 , most likely due to a shift of the qpo phase ) .",
    "the same situation also occurred in the case of re  j1034 + 396 , in which the qpo was significant in only part of the light curve , and the significance became much lower when the whole light curve was used @xcite . for 1h  0707 - 495",
    "there are 15 _ xmm - newton _ observations with good quality light curves , totaling 1200ks exposure time",
    ". this may be equivalent to that the qpo is detected in only one out of effectively @xmath52ks@xmath53ks@xmath54 searches .",
    "considering all the non - detections would lower the overall significance of the detection in the statistical sense , giving only a null probability @xmath55 .",
    "however , this is the most conservative case and should only be considered as a limit , since it is known that a qpo does not always repeat in every observation .",
    "qpos in agns may well be a transient phenomenon ( e.g. , the data suggest a duty cycle @xmath56 in the case of 1h  0707 - 495 ) .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the qpo in 1h  0707 - 495 follows closely the @xmath8 relation supports its genuineness .",
    "the qpo frequency in 1h  0707 - 495 is very close to that in re  j1034 + 396 ( @xmath57hz ) , which was argued to be a hfqpo @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising given their similar bh masses ( @xmath58 for re  j1034 + 396 and @xmath59 for 1h  0707 - 495 ) .",
    "moreover , the two agns are similar in several ways , e.g. , the nls1 classification @xcite , the high eddington ratios ( @xmath60 for re  j1034 + 396 and 0.5 for 1h  0707 - 495 ) , the x - ray spectra with a strong soft excess below 1kev , as well as the psd shapes @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the hfqpos tend to occur in this type of agns .",
    "hfqpos in bhxbs are observed only when the systems are at the very high state with high accretion rates @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the two agns having significant qpo detections , re  j1034 + 396 and 1h  0707 - 495 , are both nls1s , which are thought to be an agn analogue of bhxb at the very high state .",
    "figure 5 shows the distribution of the eddington ratios for all the bh accretion systems with reliable qpo detections ( as shown in figure [ fig4 ] ) from bhxbs to agns .",
    "for the three bhxbs , the eddington ratios are calculated from the average bolometric luminosities at which the qpo occurred from @xcite and @xcite . for the tidal disruption event ( tde ) swift  j164449.3 + 573451 in which a qpo was found , the eddington ratio is believed to be around unity or even higher since its observed luminosity is highly super - eddington @xcite .",
    "the eddington ratio of m82  x-1 was suggested to be 0.8 @xcite . as a comparison , we overplot the eddington ratio distribution for the agn sample of @xcite , in which qpos were searched for but",
    "not found .",
    "clearly the two distributions differ significantly ; a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test yields a small @xmath28-value of 0.2% .",
    "this result suggests that the hfqpos tend to occur at the highest accretion state of bh accretion systems .",
    "the origin of the hfqpo is unclear , though a number of models have been proposed in the literature , e.g. , the relativistic precession model ( rpm , @xcite ) , resonance model ( rm , @xcite ) , acoustic oscillation modes in pressure - supported accretion tori ( aom , @xcite ) , instability at disk - magnetosphere interface ( idi , @xcite ) , accretion - ejection instability in magnetized disks ( aei , @xcite ) , and global corotational instability of non - axisymmetric g - mode or p - mode trapped in the innermost region of the accretion disk ( g-/p - mode models ; @xcite ) .",
    "all these models can explain the 3:2 frequency ratio of the twin - peak qpos .",
    "the @xmath8 relation is also predicted in all except the g - mode model @xcite",
    ". only the aei and p - mode models can explain why the hfqpos occur exclusively at the very high accretion state .",
    "a common issue for the rpm , rm and aom models is a lack of underlying physical mechanisms at work , e.g. , how orbiting hot spots survive in a differentially rotating disk , how the resonances are produced , etc ( see @xcite for brief reviews and references therein ) .",
    "discussion concerning these models is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , here we briefly address the explanation and implication of our results in the framework of the resonance model .    in the resonance model , the hfqpos",
    "are suggested to be associated with the frequencies of three fundamental oscillation modes of disk fluid elements around a bh : the kepler orbital motion , the radial and vertical ( to the orbital plane ) epicyclic oscillation modes @xcite . these frequencies naturally scale inversely and linearly with the bh mass , with a dependence on the bh spin @xcite . assuming that the observed 3:2 twin - peak qpo frequencies correspond to the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies as in @xcite , the predicted @xmath8 relation is well consistent with the fitted relation from rm06 ( solid line in figure [ fig4 ] ) , which corresponds to a high bh spin close to the maximum value @xcite . to illustrate the effect of bh spin , the @xmath8 relation assuming two extreme spin values a=0 ( no spin ; dashed ) and a=0.998 ( maximum spin ; dotted ) are overplotted in figure [ fig4 ] for the @xmath61 frequency ( the lower frequency of the 3:2 twin - peak qpo ) .",
    "a zoom - in comparison with the results of 1h  0707 - 495 is shown in the upper - right inset of figure [ fig4 ] , where the bh mass estimates in this and previous work are over - plotted . as can be seen , the model can well reproduce the observed qpo frequency for a wide range of bh spin , given the relatively large uncertainty range of @xmath62 .",
    "the inferred spin values from a range of bh masses are shown in the lower - left inset in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "as one immediate inference , the allowed bh mass in 1h  0707 - 495 is in the range @xmath63 ( corresponding to from a=0 to a=0.998 ) .",
    "our best - estimate @xmath51 indicates a moderately high bh spin @xmath64 .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite suggested a high bh spin for 1h  0707 - 495 based on its relativistic fe line and reflection spectra , while @xcite argued for a low spin . in general , nls1 agn are suggested to have averagely low or moderate bh spins as a population , as found by @xcite from the relativistic fe line profile of the stacked spectra . clearly , a precise bh mass measurement , e.g. , via the reverberation mapping method with which an accuracy @xmath65 could be reached @xcite , is needed for constraining the bh spin in such agns with detected qpos .",
