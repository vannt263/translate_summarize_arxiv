    "recently , much attention has been focused on the topic of scale - free networks which characterize many social , information , technological and biological systems.@xcite the qualitative properties of many interesting real - world examples , such as the internet network , the power grid network and the protein interaction network , are as following :    ( 1 ) : :    the degree distribution has power - law tail ; ( 2 ) : :    local clustering of edges : graph is not locally tree - like ; ( 3 ) : :    small average distance .",
    "the networks can be visualized by nodes representing individuals , organizations , computers and by links between them representing their interactions . for the purpose of analyzing topology",
    ", we ignore the variation in the type of links .",
    "robustness of the network topology comes from the presence of alternate paths , which ensures the communication remains possible in spite of the damages to the network .",
    "designers of the networks must assume that networks have random failures or might be attacked , and some of these attacks can result in damage .",
    "the robust networks will continue functioning in spite of such damages .",
    "although many literatures have discussed what the optimal network topology would be , many real - world networks present the power - law degree distribution .",
    "when the scale - free networks are subjected to random breakdowns , with a fraction @xmath0 of the nodes and their connections are removed randomly , the network s integrity might be compromised : when the exponent of the power - law degree distribution @xmath1 , there exists a critical threshold @xmath2 , such that for @xmath3 , the network would break into smaller and disconnected parts , but the networks with @xmath4 are more resilient to random breakdowns .",
    "cohen _ et .",
    "al_@xcite presented a criterion to calculate the percolation critical threshold to random failures to scale - free networks .",
    "if we attack the scale - free networks intentionally : the removal of sites is not random , but rather sites with the highest connectivity are targeted first .",
    "the numerical simulations suggest that scale - free networks are highly sensitive to this kind of attack.@xcite cohen _ et . al_@xcite studied the exact value of the critical fraction needed for disruption .",
    "thus scale - free networks are highly robust against random failures of nodes and hypersensitive to intentional attacks against the system s largest nodes .",
    "so a randomly chosen node has low degree with high probability , but removal of a highly connected node might produce large effect to the network .",
    "this situation is often compared to that of the classical random graph presented by erd@xmath5s and rnyi.@xcite such graphs have a poisson degree distribution .",
    "this makes the random graphs less robust to random failures than comparable networks with power - law degree distribution , but much more robust against attacks on hubs .    in this paper , we specifically focus on the robustness of the network topology to random failures .",
    "we use the percolation theory and the optimization method to investigate the guideline which can maximize the robustness of the scale - free networks to random failures of nodes with the constrained condition that the average connectivity of per node in the network is constant .",
    "the percolation theory provides the measures of distribution which are possible ways for measuring robustness .",
    "we examine the relationship between the average connectivity per node and the network robustness to random failures .",
    "then , we investigate the trend of the network robustness to random failures with the network size @xmath6 .",
    "the work may provide the theoretical evidence that if the minimal connectivity and the exponent of the power - law degree distribution take in more optimal way , the robustness of the scale - free networks can be optimized .",
    "if we construct and maintain a network with a given number of nodes as being proportional to the average number of links @xmath7 per node in the network , our goal then becomes how to maximize the robustness of a network with @xmath6 nodes to random failures with the constraint that the number of links remains constant but the nodes are connected in a different and more optimal way .",
    "our goal is to maximize the threshold for random removal with the condition that the average degree @xmath7 per node is constant .",
    "we construct the following model .",

    "a wide range of networks have the power - law degree distribution : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the minimal connectivity and @xmath15 is an effective connectivity cutoff presented in finite networks . to the power - law degree distribution , the average @xmath7 can be given with the usual continuous approximation , this yields @xmath16}{2-\\alpha}. % \\end{array}\\ ] ] from ( [ f2.2 ] ) , @xmath17 can be calculated as @xmath18}{[k^{(3-\\alpha)}-m^{(3-\\alpha)}]}.\\ ] ] in a finite network , the largest connectivity @xmath19 can be estimated from@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath6 is the number of the network nodes .",
    "then we have that @xmath21 to the power - law degree distribution @xmath9 , we have @xmath22        & = & c[k^{(1-\\alpha)}-m^{(1-\\alpha)}]/(1-\\alpha ) , \\\\[8pt ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] this yields @xmath23}.\\ ] ] in the real world , there always exists the relation @xmath24 , so we have @xmath25 combining ( [ f2.3 ] ) and ( [ f2.4 ] ) , we have that @xmath26.\\ ] ] from ( [ f2.5 ] ) , we have the following numerical results .",
    "it can been seen from table 1 that the distribution exponent @xmath27 increases when the minimal connectivity @xmath28 increases .    combining ( [ f2.6 ] ) and ( [ f2.5 ] )",
    ", we have that @xmath29    from table 1 , we can get the following relationship :    ( 1 ) : :    when the average connectivity @xmath7 per node    is constant , the exponent @xmath27 increases when the    minimum connectivity @xmath28 increases ; ( 2 ) : :    to the minimum connectivity @xmath30 , the exponent    @xmath27 decreases when the average connectivity    @xmath31 of the network increases .    using the results obtained above",

    "the numerical results suggest that whether the network size @xmath6 is very large or not , @xmath2 reaches its maximum value when @xmath30 .",
    "the numerical results are presented in table 2 .    from table 2",
    ", we can get the following three conclusions :    ( 1 ) : :    if the average connectivity @xmath7 per node    and the exponent @xmath27 of the power - law degree    distribution is constant , the robustness of the scale - free networks    will decrease when the network size becomes larger .",

    "( 3 ) : :    to the random failures , we have to take several times cost to increase    the robustness of the scale - free networks about 1% .",
    "it is well known that the networks with power - law degree distribution are resilient to random failures . but this conclusion do nt answer the following three questions : ( i ) to a constant average connectivity @xmath7 , how to determine the distribution exponent of the scale - free networks so that the networks are more robust to the random failures .",
    "( ii ) to different network size , how many edges we need to add to the network to satisfy the robustness level to random failures .",
    "( iii ) to an exist network with power - law degree distribution , what we need to do to improve the network robustness . in this paper",
    ", we use the percolation theory and the mathematic programme method to optimize the robustness of the scale - free networks for random failures and give the numerical results .",
    "finally , we give the relationship between the threshold @xmath2 and the network size , the degree distribution exponent @xmath27 and the average connectivity @xmath7 per node .    from fig . 1",
    ", we can get the conclusion that if the scale - free networks size become large , the network robustness to random failures would become weak . to the internet and other growing scale - free networks the designers must add more links to the network to improve the average connectivity per node to random failures .",
