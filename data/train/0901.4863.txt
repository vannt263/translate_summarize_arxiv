    "the little higgs model @xcite has been proposed for solving the little hierarchy problem . in this scenario ,",
    "the higgs boson is regarded as a pseudo nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson associated with a global symmetry at some higher scale . though the symmetry is not exact , its breaking",
    "is specially arranged to cancel quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass term at 1-loop level .",
    "this is called the little higgs mechanism . as a result",
    ", the scale of new physics can be as high as 10 tev without a fine - tuning on the higgs mass term . due to the symmetry , the scenario necessitates the introduction of new particles .",
    "in addition , the implementation of the @xmath0 symmetry called t - parity to the model has been proposed in order to avoid electroweak precision measurements @xcite . in this study , we focus on the littlest higgs model with t - parity as a simple and typical example of models implementing both the little higgs mechanism and t - parity .    in order to test the little higgs model , precise determinations of properties of little higgs partners are mandatory , because these particles are directly related to the cancellation of quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass term . in particular , measurements of heavy gauge boson masses are quite important . since heavy gauge bosons acquire mass terms through the breaking of the global symmetry , precise measurements of their masses allow us to determine the most important parameter of the model , namely the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the breaking .",
    "furthermore , because the heavy photon is a candidate for dark matter @xcite , the determination of its property gives a great impact not only on particle physics but also on astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine the properties of heavy gauge bosons at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , because they have no color charge @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the international linear collider ( ilc ) will provide an ideal environment to measure the properties of heavy gauge bosons .",
    "we study the sensitivity of the measurements to the little higgs parameters at the ilc based on a realistic monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "we have used madgraph @xcite and physsim @xcite to generate signal and standard model ( sm ) events , respectively . in this study , we have also used pythia6.4 @xcite , tauola @xcite and jsfquicksimulator which implements the gld geometry and other detector - performance related parameters @xcite .",
    "the littlest higgs model with t - parity is based on a non - linear sigma model describing an su(5)/so(5 ) symmetry breaking with a vev , @xmath1 tev .",
    "an [ su(2)@xmath2u(1)]@xmath3 subgroup in the su(5 ) is gauged , which is broken down to the sm gauge group su(2)@xmath4u(1)@xmath5 . due to the presence of the gauge and yukawa interactions , the su(5 ) global symmetry",
    "is not exact .",
    "the sm doublet and triplet higgs bosons ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) arise as pseudo ng bosons in the model .",
    "the mass of the triplet higgs boson @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the sm higgs mass and @xmath10 .",
    "the triplet higgs boson is t - odd , while the sm higgs is t - even .",
    "this model contains gauge fields of the gauged [ su(2)@xmath2u(1)]@xmath3 symmetry ; the linear combinations @xmath11 and @xmath12 correspond to the sm gauge bosons for the su(2)@xmath13 and u(1)@xmath5 symmetries .",
    "the other linear combinations @xmath14 and @xmath15 are additional gauge bosons called heavy gauge bosons , which acquire masses of @xmath16 through the su(5)/so(5 ) symmetry breaking . after the electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ", the neutral components of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are mixed with each other and form mass eigenstates @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "masses of gauge bosons are given by @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) gauge coupling constant .",
    "the heavy gauge bosons ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath34 ) behave as t - odd particles , while sm gauge bosons are t - even .    to implement t - parity , two su(2 ) doublets @xmath35 and @xmath36 are introduced for each sm lepton .",
    "the quantum numbers of @xmath35 and @xmath36 under the gauged [ su(2)@xmath2u(1)]@xmath3 symmetry are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the linear combination @xmath39 gives the left - handed sm lepton . on the other hand , another linear combination @xmath40 is vector - like t - odd partner which acquires the mass of @xmath16 .",
    "the masses of depend on @xmath41 : @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , new particles are also introduced in quark sector .",
    "( for details , see ref .",
    "the representative point used in our simulation study is @xmath43 @xmath44 ( 580 gev , 134 gev , 1.5 , 0.5 ) where ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) @xmath44 ( 81.9 gev , 368 gev , 369 gev , 440 gev ) and @xmath49 is a additional yukawa coupling in the top sector .",
    "the model parameter satisfies not only the current electroweak precision data but also the wmap observation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , no fine - tuning is needed at the sample point to keep the higgs mass on the electroweak scale @xcite .    in the model , there are four processes whose final states consist of two heavy gauge bosons : @xmath50 @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the first process is undetectable . at the representative point",
    ", the largest cross section is expected for the fourth process , which is open at @xmath55 tev . on the other hand , because @xmath56 is less than 500 gev , the second process is important already at the @xmath57 gev .",
    "we , hence , concentrate on @xmath58 at @xmath57 gev and @xmath59 at @xmath60 tev .",

    ", it is also possible to confirm that the spin of @xmath75 is consistent with one and the polarization of @xmath76 from the @xmath75 decay is dominantly longitudinal .",
    "furthermore , the gauge charges of the @xmath34 boson could be also measured using a polarized electron beam .",
    "figure [ fig : cntr ] shows the probability contours for the masses of @xmath71 and @xmath72 at @xmath77 tev together with that of @xmath19 and @xmath20 at 500 gev .",
    "the mass resolution improves dramatically at @xmath78 tev , compared to that at @xmath57 gev .",
    "the littlest higgs model with t - parity is one of the attractive candidates for physics beyond the sm .",
    "we have shown that the masses of the heavy gauge bosons can be determined very accurately at the ilc .",
    "it is important to notice that these masses are obtained in a model - independent way , so that it is possible to test the little higgs model by comparing them with the theoretical predictions .",
    "furthermore , since the masses of the heavy gauge bosons are determined by the vev @xmath79 , it is possible to accurately determine @xmath79 . from the results obtained in our simulation study , it turns out that the vev @xmath79 can be determined to accuracies of 4.3% at @xmath80 500 gev and 0.1% at 1 tev .",
    "another little higgs parameter @xmath41 could also be estimated from production cross sections for the heavy gauge bosons , because the cross sections depend on the masses of heavy leptons . at the ilc with @xmath80 500 gev and 1 tev ,",
    "@xmath41 could be obtained within 9.5% and 0.8% accuracies , respectively .",
