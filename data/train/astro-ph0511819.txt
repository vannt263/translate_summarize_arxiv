    "unclassified b[e ] ( unclb[e ] ) stars cover at least @xmath3 of all galactic stars with the b[e ] phenomenon known to date , and their number is increasing steadily ( see e.g. miroshnichenko , this volume ) .",
    "these stars are concentrated towards the galactic plane , suffering severely of a mostly unknown interstellar extinction .",
    "consequently , their distances are poorly known , avoiding a proper and reliable determination of their physical parameters , like effective temperatures , luminosities , and abundances , and consequently the comprehension of their nature and evolutionary stage is rather poor .    in this work",
    ", we will present the results obtained for the curious star cd-42@xmath011721 , based on ( i ) new observational data obtained by us and using public iras and iso databases and ( ii ) by modeling the line luminosities of the forbidden emisison lines and the dust emission .",
    "intending to improve the discussion concerning the nature of southern galactic unclb[e ] stars that are very poorly studied , including cd-42@xmath011721 , we obtained low and high resolution optical spectra during different observing missions at the european southern observatory ( eso - la silla , chile ) and at the laboratrio nacional de astrofsica ( lna - brazplis , brazil ) .",
    "the high resolution spectra ( r = 48000 ) were obtained at the eso 1.52-m telescope using the fiber - fed extended range optical spectrograph ( feros ) and have a wavelength coverage from 3600  to 9200 .",
    "the low resolution spectra ( @xmath4 ) were obtained at the same telescope and at the lna 1.6-m telescope using the boller & chivens spectrograph , covering a wavelength region from 3800 to 8700 .",
    "we are also using public ir spectra taken with the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) on the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and taken with the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) .",
    "the iras low resolution spectra ( iras lrs ) cover a small wavelength range , from 7.5 to 22@xmath5 m , with a spectral resolution of about 20 - 60 . on the other hand , the sws01-iso spectrum has a higher resolution of @xmath6 1500 and a wavelength coverage from 2 to 50@xmath5 m .",
    "cd-42@xmath011721 ( v921 sco , hen 3 - 1300 , iras 16555 - 4237 ) was observed for the first time by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite classified it as an haebe star , based on the presence of a nebulosity , possible spectral and photometric variations , and some further spectral characteristics , specially in the ir .",
    "@xcite has suggested that cd-42@xmath011721 might be a young star but not a pre - main sequence star because of its high temperature and luminosity . on the other hand , a possible nebular overabundance of n / o in addition to",
    "its high luminosity , as well as some spectral similarities to other b[e ] supergiants induced @xcite to consider cd-42@xmath011721 as an evolved object .",
    "this is why @xcite have included it in the list of objects presenting the b[e ] phenomenon but with an unclear nature , the so - called unclassified b[e ] stars .    the confusion concerning the evolutionary stage of cd-42@xmath011721 is strictly linked to the absence of any reliable information about its physical parameters .",
    "since the spectrum does not show any photospheric lines , the spectral type ranges from b0 to aep ( depending on the method used ) and consequently the t@xmath7 is lying between 31600k and 12300k , respectively @xcite .",
    "its luminosity is not well known either , ranging between @xmath8 @xcite , not only because of the uncertain effective temperature , but mainly due to the unclear distance , ranging from 136pc to 2.6kpc @xcite , and the uncertain extinction being either 4.2 or 7.1 mag .",
    "using our feros spectrum ( that has a higher resolution than any other previously published for this star ) we could make a qualitative analysis , by identifying the lines and describing their profiles .",
    "the spectrum of cd-42@xmath011721 is dominated by emission lines and some ( few ) interstellar absorption lines .",
    "we could confirm the presence of the b[e ] phenomenon and see that feii is by far the ion with the largest number of lines .",
    "other highlights are the balmer lines presenting very intense emission ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we could also identify several forbidden lines of [ oi ] , [ oii ] , [ sii ] , [ nii ] , [ feii ] , [ niii ] and [ crii ] .    using the boller & chivens spectrum",
    ", we could derive the luminosities of some forbidden lines , e.g. , [ oi ] ( @xmath9@xmath9 5577 , 6300 , 6363 ) , [ oii ] ( @xmath9@xmath9 7318 , 7330 ) , [ nii ] ( @xmath9@xmath9 5754 , 6548 , 6584 ) and [ sii ] ( @xmath9@xmath9 4068 , 4076 , 6716 , 6731 ) , assuming a mean distance of 1.15 kpc and adopting the two different values of a@xmath10 ( 4.2 and 7.1 ) .",
    "next , we calculated the line luminosities of these forbidden lines , considering either a spherical scenario ( to prove or disprove the necessity of a disc ) or a two - component wind scenario . by modeling self - consistently the observed line",
    "luminosities it is possible to fix the mass loss rate of the star ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our best results were obtained with the two - component wind scenario , i.e. assuming a polar wind plus an equatorial disc ( with an open angle of @xmath11 ) .",
    "we assumed an effective temperature for cd-42@xmath011721 of 15000k , and terminal wind temperatures of 12000k for the polar wind and 8000k for the equatorial disc .",
    "the results for the [ nii ] lines , which are produced in the polar wind only , are shown exemplarily in fig .",
    "2 .    the derived mass loss rates , accounting for the two different extinction values of 4.2 and 7.1 mag , are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , when modeling the line luminosities it turned out that nitrogen has to be overabundant compared to solar , while all other elements could be modeled with solar abundances .",
    "this n overabundance and the high mass loss rates found from the modeling favour a supergiant nature ( borges fernandes et al .",
    "2005a , in preparation ) .",
    "we have also made a description of the cd-42@xmath011721 infrared spectrum based on iras lrs and especially sws01 iso public data .",
    "we could identify several new features that were not cited previously in the literature ( borges fernandes et al .",
    "2005b , in preparation ) .",
    "the presence of the many h recombination lines and the forbidden lines is remarkable , and especially the so - called `` dual - dust '' chemistry @xcite , characterized by the simultaneous presence of solid state bands of c - rich and o - rich dust being produced in the same environment .",
    "the c - rich material is represented by pah emission bands @xcite and the o - rich dust by some features caused by crystalline silicates @xcite .",
    "using photometric data from the literature , we could obtain the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of cd-42@xmath011721 .",
    "it is double peaked , similar to those called",
    " group i \" of haebe stars @xcite .",
    "we have tried to model this sed , considering different physical parameters ( including those obtained by our optical study ) , using a code that treats the radiative transfer in a sherical envelope making use of the monte carlo method @xcite . as can be seen in the fig .",
    "3 , we could not model properly this sed , indicating that a non - spherical model , most plausibly a disc scenario , is indeed necessary to account for the observed sed , in agreement with our optical analysis .",
    "a study involving a non - spherical dust distribution is currently under investigation ( borges fernandes et al .",
    "2005b , in preparation ) .",
    "cd-42@xmath011721 is a very curious star whose evolutionary stage is still unclear .",
    "our analysis resulted in arguments for as well as against the classification as either a young or an evolved object :    in favour of a young haebe nature speak its ir characteristics , specially its double peaked sed and the position of this object in color - color diagrams .",
    "however , we can not discard a possible contamination of the photometric data , since cd-42@xmath011721 is lying in a crowded region , hosting several stars as well as a cloud which might be of interstellar nature",
    ".    in favour of a supergiant nature speaks our optical analysis which shows excellent results considering a supergiant two - component wind scenario , and which , in addition , indicated the necessity of an n overabundance . against this scenario speaks , however , the dual - dust chemistry , specially the presence of c - rich dust which is difficult to explain with a supergiant scenario whose spectrum is dominated by h recombination lines .",
    "we clearly need more multiwavelength and high spatial resolution observations of cd-42@xmath011721 and its close - by circumstellar medium for a better determination of its nature .",
    "in this work , we are showing clearly how hard the life is for those people that are studying unclb[e ] stars .",
    "however , the future is very promising since new observations using different techniques , like high resolution spectroscopy , spectropolarimetry and interferometry in different spectral regions , will allow us to understand better on the one hand the nature of these fascinating objects , and on the other hand some important stellar evolutionary phases that are still poorly known and investigated .",
