    "formation of localized coherent structures during the interaction of intense laser pulses with plasmas is an important topic of the laser plasmas research , which is vital for diagnostic purposes in the experiments with laser ion acceleration , the fast ignition of controlled thermonuclear fusion , the investigation of warm dense matter , high energy density phenomena , and laboratory astrophysics ( see article @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "when the laser pulse interacts with a homogeneous plasma region , we expect the pulse to penetrate inside the plasma and propogate with minor energy losses in case of underdense plasma .",
    "quantitavely speaking , we expect laser pulse to penetrate if @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the laser carrier frequency and @xmath2 is the electron plasma frequency .",
    "the larger the @xmath3 ratio is , the lower is the laser pulse depletion rate .",
    "however , eventually a finite duration laser pulse completely depletes due to stimulated raman scattering , various pulse filamentation instabilities and transformation to various localized coherent structures @xcite .",
    "these processes lead to the formation of langmuir waves , electromagnetic solitons , and electron vortices retaining electromagnetic energy .    besides self - focusing channels and langmuir waves , we consider two classes of coherent structures that happen to form in laser plasmas simulations . in two - dimentional plasmas , we can distinguish solitons @xcite and electron vortices @xcite .",
    "electron vortices are coherent localized structures , which keep quasistatic magnetic flux locked inside the electron cavity .",
    "solitons enclose the electromagnetic wave inside the density gap .",
    "though having slightly different conditions of generation , in 3d case these structures are usually combined in one , posessing some features from both of them @xcite .",
    "on an electron timescale @xmath4 , these coherent structures are quasistationary . in the case of immobile ions ,",
    "an analytical stationary solution exists , see section ii .",
    "however , on a proton timescale @xmath5 , we expect these vortices to evolve , as the uncompensated proton charge results in coloumb explosion of the whole vortex @xcite",
    ". hereafter , we will call it `` vortex explosion '' . here",
    "we investigate the structure and evolution of the relativistic electron vortices .",
    "we present a simple analytical vortex model which illustrates the main features of realistic vortex structure .",
    "we carry out two - dimensional ( 2d ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations using the remp code based on the density decomposition scheme @xcite .",
    "we discuss in detail a number of effects occurring during the evolution of electron vortices : the coulomb explosion of the uncompensated proton core of the vortex , multistream processes that lead to shell - like structure formation , instability at the vortex boundary leading to the edge field intensification and transformation into smaller vortices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the analytical solution for stationary vortex structure is presented . in section iii",
    ", we describe the simulation parameters . in section iv",
    ", we discuss simulation results of the evolution of the electron vortex , addressing the observed effects . in the concluding section",
    ", we summarize the results obtained .",
    "before discussion of the simulations of the vortex structure evolution , we present theoretical estimates for the analytical structure of the electron vortex in the magnetized collisionless plasma region .      we start from maxwell equations @xmath6 and relativistic plasma motion equations @xmath7 here , current @xmath8 and charge density @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 and relativistic gamma - factors for electrons and ions are @xmath11    all equations are in dimensionless form .",
    "hereafter , we will measure spatial parameters in @xmath12 , temporal  in @xmath13 , densities  in critical densities @xmath14 , electromagnetic fields  in @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is electron mass , @xmath17 is the absolute value of electron charge , @xmath18 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "in addition , we note that in dimentionless units @xmath19 becomes @xmath20 and velocities are measured in fractions of light speed in vacuum .      changing to cylindrical coordiantes",
    "@xmath21 , we further assume asymmetry and homogeneity along the @xmath22-axis , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "we denote vector components by subscripts corresponding to respective coordinates , e.g. , for electric field e components are @xmath24 . besides , we assume that @xmath25    then eq . ( [ eq : divb ] ) becomes identity and from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : et])-([eq : vit ] ) together with definitions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : j])-([eq : n ] ) we obtain @xmath26    we also assume that plasma is neutral at infinity and the total charge is zero : @xmath27      now we assume @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and neglect eqs ( [ eq : virt - cyl])-([eq : vitt - cyl ] ) .",
    "then eqs ( [ eq : ert - cyl ] ) , ( [ eq : bzt - cyl ] ) and ( [ eq : vett - cyl ] ) become identities and from eqs ( [ eq : ett - cyl ] ) , ( [ eq : err - cyl ] ) and ( [ eq : vert - cyl ] ) we obtain @xmath33 where prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath34 , @xmath35 .      neglecting the last term in eq ( [ eq : ebv ] ) in the limit of non - relativistic electron motion , @xmath36 , and resolving this system wit respect to @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "we obtain @xmath40 where we assume @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the system eqs ( [ sol : vet])-([sol : bz ] ) gives the solution provided that a reasonable profile is set for @xmath43 .",
    "there could be infinite number of vortex shapes , however not all of them are stable . here",
    "we do not consider the problem of stability .",
    "we assume the dependence of @xmath44 on @xmath34 as @xmath45 it corresponds to a situation when the inner region of the vortex is represented by the homogeneous proton region , and to some extent in cyllindrical geometry @xmath44 grows lineary with radius , until the electric field is being shielded by outside plasmas . then from eq ( [ sol : bz ] ) we obtain @xmath46 with the following asymptotic at @xmath47 @xmath48 we assume that @xmath39 vanishes at infinity , which leads to @xmath49 in addition , we impose the condition on @xmath39 to have a local maximum at @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath51 which ensures positive number under the root sign in eq ( [ sol : b0 ] ) . for @xmath52 , see the profiles in fig .",

    ", width=302 ]    this simple vortex model highlights the main features of electron vortex - electron cavitation , localization of the magnetic flux inside the electron cavity and electron density increase in the vicinity of vortex boundary @xcite .",
    "though we are going to consider mildly relativistic electron vortices , the above consideration of nonrelativistic case fairly reproduces the main features we are going to observe in the next section .",
    "in order to investigate the processes that occur during the electron vortex evolution , we conduct a series of 2d pic simulations . in our simulations , we set the homogeneous square of cold electron - proton plasma with the density about @xmath53 and size of @xmath54 with zero temperatures of protons and electrons . for the sake of simplicity , we form a symmetric electron vortex , artificially generating the localized magnetic field distribution during a number of initial timesteps . as we are not interested in the physical reasons of vortex formation , but would like to discuss the evolution of these coherent structures , this method is suitable for our purposes .",
    "thus , we add the following profile of the magnetic field in our numerical scheme @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the maximum amplitude of the added magnetic field profile , @xmath57 is the typical vortex width , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are initial coordinates of the vortex center .",
    "we use this addition to the magnetic field calculations each timestep during the first 5 time units . for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , at time equals to 10 , we observe a quasistatic vortex structure with the maximum magnetic field amplitude of @xmath62 and @xmath63 in diameter .",
    "these parameters are chosen in the way to satisfy the conditions for `` magnetized electrons and unmagnetized ions '' approach that is used in the theoretical description of the electron vortex evolution @xcite .",
    "quantitavely speaking , we set the value of the maximum magnetic field inside the cavity satisfying the relation @xmath64 which means that the field energy is enough to expel the electrons out from the axis region of the vortex ( left inequality ) , but not strong enough to influence proton dynamics significantly @xcite .",
    "the computational grid is @xmath65 with 32 nodes per each cell .",
    "the initial particle - in - cell number is equal to 16 .",
    "the total number of particles is about @xmath66 .",
    "the integration timestep equals to 0.0125 time units .",
    "the total time of simulations is 300 time units .",
    "as we expected , the simulation with immobile ions justifies that there is a quasistationary configuration of electron fluid rotating in the localized magnetic field , which is similar to one described in section ii .",
    "however , on a proton timescale @xmath67 , we find out that these vortices expand due to noncompensated positive charge enclosed in the electron cavity . here",
    "we consider how the vortex evolves during the simulation time . in case of @xmath68 ( see figure [ fig : firstdens ] ) we observe an axisymmetric electron cavity with a substantinal increase of the electron density around the shock - like vortex boundary , up to @xmath69 .",

    "these facts give us a description of the evolution of the vortex using the snowplow model @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the magnetic flux inside the cavity is constant in time ( i.e. , we assume an adiabatic approximation ) .",
    "then , we can suppose that the whole dynamics is determined by the magnetic field pressure on a walls of axisymmetric vortex .",
    "we write    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the mass of plasma pushed to the radius @xmath73 by the magnetic flux and @xmath74 , where index @xmath75 denotes to the initial values of the magnetic field and vortex radius .",
    "we can rewrite this equation in dimentionless variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 :    @xmath78    which is the same as in @xcite .",
    "the solution could be written as follows :    @xmath79    for which the asymptotics in @xmath80 limit are : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 ( note the misprint in @xcite ) . comparing the obtained asymptotics with simulations , we plot the figure [ fig : asympt ] .",
    "we observe quite a good agreement of the radius evolution between theory and simulations , despite the simplification of theoretical model in comparison with the simulation setup .",

    "the subsequent decrease of the proton momentum is due to the finite velocity of interacting electromagnetic field propagation .",
    "while exploding due to the coloumb repulsion , more and more protons are involved in the process , starting to move radially .",
    "the @xmath89 figure shows that there are numerous proton shells that move radially in an axisymmetric way .",

    "physically , it means that there are multiple proton shells located at the same spatial coordinate but having the broad range of energies .",
    "this reveals a rise of a multistream instability , leading to the enhanced proton energy gain rate .",
