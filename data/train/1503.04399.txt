    "_ photonic _ bandgap crystals are artificial dielectric or metallic structures in which any electromagnetic wave propagation is forbidden within a fairly large frequency range .",
    "a photonic crystal with a complete bandgap could be used to localize electromagnetic waves to specific arrays , to guide and control the propagation of the waves along certain directions at restricted frequencies @xcite .",
    "photonic crystal waveguide ( pcw ) can be made by removing a row of either air columns or dielectric rods that result in multimode guiding @xcite .",
    "pcws devices are very promising candidates for all optical telecommunication purposes due to the absence of energy losses and their ability for strong light confinement @xcite .",
    "if pcws are placed in a close proximity , a coupled pcw is formed and the optical power is efficiently transferred from one pcw to another .",
    "recently , the coupled pcws have received much attention because of their promising applications to ultra - compact , miniaturized photonic devices such as filters , switches , power dividers , and couplers .    in the manuscript",
    "we propose two weakly coupled pcws as promising and realistic experimental model for all - optical amplification .",
    "our idea of amplification of the optical signals in two weakly coupled pcws is based on the possibility of coexistence of two ( even and odd ) fundamental modes , which have different propagation properties at the same frequency . particularly , if the light is launched into two",
    "coupled pcws at some particular frequency properly chosen , only one mode becomes a propagating mode , whereas another mode is completely reflected from the system and its carried power flux is exactly zero .",
    "the operating setup is quite similar to the y - junction type waveguide analyzed in a detail in @xcite .",
    "the novelty of our work is that we give a deep physical insight into the realization of the optical signal amplification in such a guiding system .",
    "it should be emphasized that all the scenarios of all - optical amplification considered in the manuscript are completely linear , thus there is no need for implementation of nonlinear effects .",
    "very recently , in order to demonstrate the effect of all - optical amplification , the authors have studied a simple structure , which is composed of two coupled conventional dielectric waveguides separated by silver metallic film and bounded by perfect electric conductors ( pec ) @xcite . despite the fact that some promising results have been obtained , due to sufficient losses in the metallic film , it is very difficult to vividly demonstrate the effect of all - optical amplifications and what it more important , it is difficult to conduct the experiments . to avoid these difficulties , we propose weakly coupled pcws system as a realistic model for all - optical amplification , because of their ability to realize the complete confinement of slow light without metallic support .",
    "the authors believe that these studies could open the possibility to design novel devices with the wide practical application in all - optical computing systems .",
    "the two coupled symmetric pillar type pcws consisting of square lattice of dielectric rods in free space is illustrated in fig .",
    "the guiding regions are bounded by the upper and lower photonic crystals , which have a common period @xmath0 along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the parameters of the structure are chosen as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the relative permittivity and radius of the dielectric circular rods , @xmath8 is a width of the pcw and @xmath9 is the number of layers of the upper and lower photonic crystals .",
    "the length of the photonic crystals is @xmath10 . in the case of pillar type photonic crystal waveguide",
    ", the modes are confined in the guiding region only due to the existence of bandgap region , since the effective index of the guiding region is smaller than that of the cladding region . under the adjusted parameters ,",
    "the pillar type photonic crystal has a photonic bandgap for @xmath11-polarized field @xmath12 in the frequency range @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a wavelength in a free space .",
    "the dispersion diagrams of the coupled pcws ( fig . 1 )",
    "are studied based on the coupled - mode formulation @xcite , which we have recently proposed using the first - order perturbation theory taking into account a weak coupling effect .",
    "based on the derived coupled - mode equations @xcite normalized propagation constant @xmath15 of the pillar type coupled pcws ( fig.1 ) for the even mode and odd mode versus the normalized frequency @xmath16 is calculated and it is plotted in fig .",
    "1b by red line and blue lines , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that no other propagating modes exist in the frequency range @xmath13 . from the figure it follows",
    "that in the lower frequency region @xmath17 the even mode enters in a cutoff region and only odd mode is propagating along the @xmath1-axis . from a viewpoint of the practical application of the coupled pcws structure as all - optical amplifier ,",
    "we are interested in the frequency region @xmath17 , where only one propagating mode exists . all the numerical analysis that follow",
    "are conducted at the fixed normalized frequency @xmath18 .    to validate the use of the coupled pcws as all - optical amplifier , firstly",
    ", we analyze the power flux of a continuous signal launched into the coupled pcws ( fig.1 ) using the fdtd method @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the discretization step size as @xmath19 , where @xmath0 is the lattice period .",
    "the discretized time step is @xmath20 , by which the stability condition of fdtd method is satisfied .",
    "the analysis region is surrounded by berenger s pml with thickness of 20 cells in all of the surrounding walls .",
    "the initial excitations are injected into the coupled pcws at @xmath21 through port 1 and port 2 .",
    "input ports are bounded by pec walls marked by gray lines in fig .",
    "the output signal is registered by the detector placed at a distance @xmath22 inside the coupled pcws .",
    "the length of the detector is @xmath23 and it is parallel along the @xmath24-axis . to demonstrate the effect of all - optical amplification ,",
    "firstly we inject a signal with unit amplitude in port 1 , whereas no signal @xmath25 is launched in port 2 . the power flux @xmath26 of the total input signal is illustrated in fig .",
    "2a . in this case",
    "the total input could be represented as a sum of even and odd modes and since the coupled pcws support only the odd mode at @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "1b ) , the even mode is completely reflected and the total output power @xmath27 is half of the input power as shown in fig .",
    "next , we inject a continuous signal in port 2 with an amplitude @xmath28 . the total input power flux @xmath29 is illustrated in fig .",
    "it is important to mention that in order to guide an input signal into the coupled pcws , which supports only one odd mode , the injected signals in port 1 and port 2 should be with opposite phases . the output power flux @xmath30 is presented in fig .",
    "the amplification coefficient is calculated as @xmath31 and it is equal to @xmath32 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in case of weakly coupled pcws the result for the amplification coefficient is very close to the result obtained using the rigorous theoretical analysis @xcite @xmath33 additionally , our numerical analysis have vividly demonstrated that the amplification coefficient is substantially improved in comparison to the results for the conventional dielectric waveguides separated by silver metallic film @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that an increase of the amplification coefficient is caused by the absence of energy losses in pillar type coupled pcws .",
    "finally , we further increase the amplitude of the injected signal in input port 2 up to @xmath34 and the power flux of the input @xmath35 and output @xmath36 signals are illustrated in fig .",
    "2e and fig .",
    "2f , respectively .",
    "the amplification coefficient is @xmath37 .",
    "the results for the amplification coefficients @xmath38 at different amplitudes @xmath39 are presented in some detail in table 1 . from the results it follows that the amplification coefficient is inversely proportional to the amplitude @xmath39 of the input signal .    next , in fig .",
    "3 we are analyzing the near field distributions of the gaussian pulse propagating in the weakly coupled pcws .",
    "the time waveform of the gaussian pulse is centered at the time step 4500 and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the pulse is 1500 time steps .",
    "near field distributions at @xmath25 , @xmath28 and @xmath34 at different moments of time are presented in fig .",
    "3f , respectively .",
    "the amplification coefficient of gaussian pulse is calculated and the results are presented in table 1 .",
    "similarly to the previous case of continuous signal , a good agreement between our results and the case considered in @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the near field distribution of the gaussian pulse injected in port 1 and port 2 with the same phase ( even mode ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "the pulse in completely reflected from the coupled pcws and there is no power carried inside the coupled pcws .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coupled pillar type pcws do not support the even mode at the normalized frequency @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "the coupled pcws behave as a phase filter providing maximum output power for the signals with the opposite phases ( fig .",
    "3f ) and zero power for the signal with the same phases ( see fig .",
    ".[12 ] * amplification coefficient @xmath38 at different amplitudes @xmath39 of the input signal launched into two coupled pcw - s ( fig.1a ) .",
    "the results are compared with those obtained by the rigorous analysis @xcite . * [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this manuscript , for the first time , we have proposed a weakly coupled photonic crystals waveguide as a realistic model for all - optical amplifier .",
    "it should be noted that the amplification effect of the optical signal proposed in the manuscript is quite different from that in homodyne receiver scheme , where the signal intensity is amplified at the receiving area only , whereas the total signal is not amplified .",
    "the authors believe that one of the promising practical applications of the proposed structure could be optical transistors .",
    "being able to precisely control the intensity of one light beam using another could be crucial to the development of optical transistors capable of performing complex light - controlling in all - optical circuits .",
