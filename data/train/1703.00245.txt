    "standard three - flavor neutrino oscillation paradigm consists of six oscillation parameters , these are ; ( i ) 3-mixing angles ( @xmath1 ) , ( ii ) 2-mass squared differences ( @xmath2 ) and ( iii ) the dirac cp phase @xmath3 .",
    "almost two decades of neutrino oscillation experiments have measured or given hints about these parameters . currently , the major three unknowns in neutrino oscillation physics are , ( i ) neutrino mass hierarchy , i.e. the sign of @xmath4(@xmath5 is known as the normal hierarchy ( nh ) or @xmath6 is known as the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) ) , ( ii ) the octant of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is known as the lower octant ( lo ) or @xmath9 is known as the higher octant ( ho ) ) and ( iii ) the cp phase @xmath3 , recently t2k results hint towards the maximal @xmath3 value @xcite .",
    "the ( lbl ) oscillation experiments like , t2k @xcite and no@xmath0a @xcite which are currently taking data , can provide information on these unknowns .",
    "the major obstacles which these lbl experiments have to overcome are the issues of parameter degeneracies i.e. at least two different sets of parameters giving rise to the same oscillation probability .    in this work , we show in a comprehensive way the parameter degeneracies in the test ( @xmath10)-plane for a given set of representative true values for both the hierarchies . depending on right ( r ) or wrong ( w )",
    "values of ( hierarchy@xmath11octant@xmath12 ) , there can be 8-possible solutions .",
    "we show all the possible observed degeneracies , by considering no@xmath0a neutrino runs and then we discuss the role of antineutrinos ( @xmath13 s ) to resolve these degeneracies .",
    "we then demonstrate how the addition of t2k and ical@ino can help in further constraining the degenerate solutions .",
    "sub - leading effects originating from new physics beyond standard model may affect the determination of various unknowns in neutrino oscillation physics . in the near future , this can be probed in the neutrino oscillation experiments . in this respect ,",
    "we also present a possible new physics scenario , namely nsi and discuss its effect on the determination of neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "the oscillation probabilities which are relevant in our study are considered from @xcite .",
    "the simulation details and experimental specifications that we considered are given in ref . @xcite and the references there in .",
    "the current best fit values and @xmath14 ranges , that we considered in our study are consistent with @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present the degeneracies present in both probability and @xmath15 level and the role of the @xmath13 s to resolve these degeneracies . we also discuss the role of t2k and ical@ino .",
    "the first column of fig.([fig : nova_deg ] ) describes the degeneracies in the appearance channel .",
    "the descriptions of the various bands are given in the figure .",
    "we see here that the overlapping regions between navy - blue and green bands show the degeneracy for the same values of @xmath16 .",
    "whereas , by drawing a horizontal line for a given probability one can identify various other degeneracies present at the probability level .       in the first column of fig .",
    "[ fig : nsi_dune ] , we present the @xmath17 vs @xmath18 ( model - independent range ) for fixed energy , @xmath16 .",
    "the width of the bands are over octant for a given hierarchy as described in the figure .",
    "we mainly focus on a special point , @xmath19 for which , the nsi effect gets nullified by the usual matter term .",
    "hence , in absence of off - diagonal nsi parameters any lbl experiments will not be able to lift this degeneracy . in the second column",
    ", we discuss this degeneracy at the @xmath20 level and also describe the role of off - diagonal nsi parameter @xmath21 . here",
    ", brown curve shows the degeneracy for @xmath19 at @xmath20 level and the pink curve shows that addition of @xmath21 is not able to lift the degeneracy once @xmath19 .",
    "whereas , the green curve shows that if @xmath22 then dune can have hierarchy sensitivity if certain ranges of @xmath18 are not allowed . in conclusion , we describe the ( hierarchy@xmath11octant@xmath12 ) generalized degeneracy and their resolution using neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we also discuss the impact of nsi on the mass hierarchy determination in case of dune .",
