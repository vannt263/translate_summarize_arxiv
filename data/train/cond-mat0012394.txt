    "small nematic droplets embedded in a polymer matrix give rise to light scattering effects @xcite which are controllable by an external electric field and thus can be applied in electro - optical light shutters of high contrast . on the other hand , from the viewpoint of basic research , nematics confined by curved surfaces are challenging as they exhibit non - trivial director fields . due to the large surface - to - volume ratio the boundary conditions at the surface strongly influence the emerging structures which reveal a large variety of topological defects @xcite .",
    "the structure of nematics confined in a spherical droplet or a cylindrical capillary tube has been studied in detail . for the spherical droplet",

    "( for some years , the inverse problem of a nematic surrounding an isotropic spherical droplet has been addressed , too @xcite . )",
    "on the other hand , in a cylindrical geometry , homeotropic or tangential surface anchoring does not lead to a line defect , instead , this disclination generally turns out to be unstable against an `` escape '' of the director field lines along the symmetry axis of the tube @xcite .    in our contribution",
    ", we consider an advanced scenario , namely , the confinement of a nematic liquid crystal in a torus .",

    "for some years now , the method of finite elements has been applied to the study of liquid crystals and polymers in complex geometries @xcite .",

    "ii the finite element method for director fields in a torus is introduced .",
    "section iii presents a survey of equilibrium director configurations for various situations .",
    "finally , section iv contains some concluding remarks .",
    "the geometry of our system is confined by a torus with its symmetry axis along the @xmath0 direction and its large circle in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane .",
    "the radii of the large and small circle are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the torus is filled by a nematic liquid crystal whose director field is fixed at the inner surface of the torus . according to the toroidal geometry there are three distinct boundary conditions of dirichlet type .",
    "their respective directors at the surface on sections of the torus across the @xmath1-@xmath0 and @xmath2-@xmath0 coordinate planes are visualized from an oblique view in figure 2 .",
    "( note that for sake of clarity not all directors that were calculated on the grid are displayed . )",
    "the director can be anchored either perpendicular ( _ homeotropic _ ) or tangential to the surface .",
    "tangential anchoring can be established along sections across the small circle of the torus ( _ transversal - tangential _ ) or , alternatively , following the direction of its large circle ( _ azimuthal - tangential _ ) .",
    "in addition to the boundary conditions at the surface , the director field is affected by an external magnetic field .",
    "we examine the influence of both a homogeneous magnetic field and an inhomogeneous magnetic field of axial symmetry .",
    "the latter is created by an electric current through a wire of infinite length along the symmetry axis of the torus , giving rise to closed magnetic field lines along the azimuthal direction . whereas the azimuthal magnetic field as well as the homogeneous field along the @xmath0 direction still preserve axial symmetry",
    ", this rotational symmetry does not hold any more for a `` lateral '' homogeneous field along the @xmath1 axis .",
    "obviously , for such a scenario , a finite element calculation in three dimensions is necessary .",
    "the particular combinations of boundary conditions and magnetic fields that we considered in our calculations will be introduced in the following section . for each combination",
    "the equilibrium director fields are found from a numerical minimization of the free energy @xmath5 of the nematic , with the corresponding energy density @xmath6 the first three terms in ( [ energydens1 ] ) form the elastic free energy density due to _ splay _ , _ twist _ and _ bend _ deformations , respectively , of the director field @xmath7 , according to oseen , zcher and frank @xcite .",

    ", the geometrical parameters of the confining torus are changed .",
    "its large radius ranges from @xmath37 to 9 , whereas its small radius is between @xmath38 and 2.4 .",
    "the free energy functional ( [ energydens2 ] ) is now discretized on an irregular lattice consisting of between 18744 and 26624 tetrahedron - like finite elements ( depending on system size ) , which corresponds to 4892 up to 6848 vertices or , equivalently , to an average lattice constant of about 0.48 .",
    "the tilt and twist angles are then defined on the vertices of the finite element grid and the total free energy is obtained numerically from an integration according to ( [ energydens2 ] ) .",
    "( for further technical details on the finite element method for nematics we refer to the appendix . )",
    "starting from suitable initial configurations , the equilibrium director fields that correspond to local minima of the total free energy are calculated via a standard newton - gau - seidel relaxation method , where the director angles @xmath39 and @xmath40 on each internal vertex @xmath41 are immediately replaced by their respective corrected values , according to @xmath42 the functional derivatives in ( [ seidel1 ] ) and ( [ seidel2 ] ) are again evaluated numerically .",
    "let us first introduce the different combinations of boundary and initial conditions as well as the external magnetic field . both for homeotropic boundary conditions and for transversal - tangential anchoring ,",
    "the following combinations of initial configurations and magnetic field direction are chosen : @xmath43 a @xmath44 ring defect with a homogeneous magnetic field along the @xmath0 axis , @xmath45 both director and magnetic field homogeneous along @xmath0 , @xmath46 both director and magnetic field in azimuthal direction . whereas @xmath43 amounts in a distortion of the director field",
    ", @xmath45 yields a topologically distinct configuration , consisting of two @xmath47 ring defects .",
    "@xmath46 favors the `` escape '' of the director field along the azimuthal direction . for azimuthal - tangential anchoring we assume initial configurations with director and magnetic field along the @xmath0 and azimuthal direction , respectively .",
    "finally , we consider a `` laterally '' homogeneous director and magnetic field , _ i.e. _ , along the @xmath1 direction , as initial condition for several types of anchoring .",
    "we start the discussion on director configurations in a toroidal volume by considering homeotropic surface anchoring . with the external magnetic field",
    "being switched off , there are mainly three possible solutions .",
    "their visualization in the sections of the torus across the @xmath1-@xmath0 and @xmath2-@xmath0 cooodinate planes is presented in figure 3 .",
    "if the director field does not exhibit an azimuthal component , there are closed disclinations , namely , defect rings .",
    "these rings can be classified according to the strength of the disclination @xcite . in our toroidal system",
    "we expect either one ring of strength @xmath44 located in the central region of the torus ( fig .",
    "3a ) or , alternatively , two rings of strength @xmath48 at its outer parts ( fig .",
    "another possible director configuration is the `` escape '' structure ( fig .",
    "3c ) where the director in the bulk turns towards the azimuthal direction . in this way",
    ", the occurence of defect rings would be suppressed .    for homeotropic",
    "anchoring , both the homogeneous magnetic field along @xmath0 and the azimuthal magnetic field are in conflict with the director orientation at the torus surface .",
    "the homogeneous field is expected to yield a ring configuration , whereas the azimuthal field favors the escape configuration .",
    "figure 4 displays the energy of the three director configurations versus the inverse magnetic coherence length which , as indicated above , is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field",
    ". please note that each of the three curves is related to the type of magnetic field favoring the respective bulk director orientation ( see figure caption for details ) . in order to compare systems of different size ( the torus radii are @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath49 , @xmath51 in the top and bottom part , respectively , of figure 4 )",
    "the total energy is divided by the torus volume @xmath52 .",
    "surprisingly , with zero magnetic field the escape structure is not stable .",
    "this is contrary to the director field in a cylindrical tube where disclinations are usually avoided by a director escape along the axis of the cylinder @xcite . in a torus",
    ", however , the escape seems to be suppressed .",
    "therefore , we attribute this behavior to the additional curvature along the azimuthal direction which is absent in a cylinder .",
    "even when the small circle of the torus is increasing , the escape is far from being stable ( fig .  4 , bottom ) .",
    "it can be stabilized against the global minimum only by a strong magnetic field along the azimuthal direction which , for our parametrization , should correspond to a coherence length of at least 0.65 .    from figure 4 it is revealed that the global minimum configuration is the two - ring director field ( fig .",
    "although the total topological charge is the same as in the one - ring configuration , it is energetically preferred , because a major percentage of the toroidal volume is filled by an almost homogeneous director field along @xmath0 .",
    "( obviously , the relative stability of the two - ring configuration is further enhanced by a homogeneous magnetic field along @xmath0 . )",
    "let us compare the situation to a spherical nematic drop subject to homeotropic surface anchoring .",
    "there , the analoga of the one - ring and two - ring configuration are a radial point defect @xcite and an equatorial defect ring ( `` saturn ring '' ) @xcite . when the radius of the drop is not too small , the point defect is always favored to the ring , due to its much lower energy . in the torus , however , the two competing defect configurations are much more similar , and therefore it is the smooth director field rather than the defects which decides about their relative stability .    the situation is qualitatively changed for transversal - tangential surface anchoring . again the one - ring , two - ring and escape configurations are possible solutions which are visualized in figure 5 .",
    "the one - ring configuration is known as closed vortex line ( fig .",
    "5a ) , whereas the defects in the two - ring director field are located on the very surface of the torus ( fig .",
    "the escape configuration is analogous to the one for homeotropic anchoring ( fig .",
    "interestingly , for not too large radii of the small circle of the torus and for weak magnetic fields , the escape is now absolutely stable ( fig .",
    "6 , top ) . a homogeneous magnetic field along @xmath0 with coherence length larger than 0.35",
    "is needed to stabilize the closed vortex or surface defects against the escape . on the other hand ,",
    "if we increase the small radius of the torus , the escape is suppressed again ( fig .",
    "6 , bottom ) .",
    "the stability of the escape for transversal - tangential anchoring can be understood from the elastic properties of the nematic sample . as stated ,",
    "our parametrization is based on 5cb , which is an example for a rod - like molecule with elastic anisotropy @xmath53 .",
    "the escape configuration with transversal - tangential anchoring mainly requires _ twist _",
    "deformations , whereas for the escape with homeotropic anchoring _ bend _ deformations are predominant . for rod - like molecules , @xmath9 usually is the smallest elastic constant . undergoing an escape , the increase of the elastic energy due to _ twist _",
    "deformations is not too large , and it can be overcompensated by the disappearance of the defect rings .",
    "( for disc - like molecules the elastic anisotropy is reversed , which should cause a stable escape configuration in case of homeotropic rather than tangential anchoring . )",
    "as mentioned above , for increasing small radius of the torus , the escape becomes unstable against the two - ring configuration .",
    "the latter enables an almost homogeneous director field in the bulk , apart from the two closed surface disclinations . here",
    ", the two - ring director field is the analogon of the so - called `` boojum '' configuration in a spherical nematic drop with tangential anchoring , where two point defects occur at opposite poles of the sphere @xcite .    whereas for homeotropic and transversal - tangential anchoring we find a smooth dependence of the free energy on the strength of the magnetic field , the situation is different for azimuthal - tangential anchoring",
    "obviously , an azimuthal director field now is the stable configuration for zero magnetic field ( fig .",
    "when applying a homogeneous magnetic field along @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "7b ) , we find a threshold field strength which must be exceeded in order to change the director configuration ( fig .",
    "8) . for magnetic fields slightly above the threshold",
    "only the director in the central part of the torus turns into @xmath0 direction , which means an abrupt jump of the energy to larger values .",
    "when the magnetic field further increases , the director in the outer regions of the torus gradually aligns parallel to the magnetic field and , therefore , the energy is again decreasing .",
    "as we notice from figure 8 , the threshold field crucially depends on the small radius of the torus : for larger @xmath4 the onset of the reorientation already occurs at smaller correlation lengths , mainly because the elastic deformation can be spread over a larger region . on the other hand , the large radius @xmath3 of the torus does not significantly influence the emerging director fields .",
    "finally , let us turn towards a more complicated scenario .",
    "when a strong homogeneous magnetic field is applied along the @xmath1 direction , the system does not possess axial symmetry any more .",
    "therefore , we have to analyze the three - dimensional visualizations in detail .",
    "we first consider a director configuration with homeotropic anchoring , subject to a lateral magnetic field of reduced coherence length @xmath54 .",
    "this field is strong enough to force the director in the bulk to align along @xmath1 , which can clearly be seen from a top view onto the section of the torus across the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane ( fig .  9 , top ) .",
    "when we look at the sections across the remaining coordinate planes ( fig .",
    "9 , bottom ) , two limits can be discerned in the director alignment . due to the director orientation in the bulk along @xmath1 ,",
    "locally in the @xmath2-@xmath0 plane there is an escape , comparable to figure 3c . on the other hand ,",
    "the director configuration in the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane strongly resembles the two - ring configuration of figure 3b , but with the disclinations now appearing close to the upper and lower edge of the torus rather than in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane .",
    "therefore , the fact that the escape configuration does not exhibit any defects means that the disclinations occuring in the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane are curved , but not closed .",
    "instead , they are of finite length , terminating at points where the _ bend _ deformation that causes the escape structure becomes more favorable energetically .",
    "thereby , the extension of the disclinations covers an azimuthal range of @xmath55 , as revealed from a more thorough analysis of the configuration .",
    "an analogous director reorientation is observed for transversal - tangential anchoring ( fig .",
    "again , the escape structure occurs in the @xmath2-@xmath0 plane , whereas in the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane we now find the two - ring surface defects according to fig .",
    ", these surface defects appear in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane ( fig .  10 , bottom ) .",
    "due to the smaller elastic _ splay _ energy , which dominates the reorientation in case of tangential anchoring , the escape covers a larger azimuthal range , thus reducing the extension of the surface defects to @xmath56 .",
    "1 .   summarizing our work ,",
    "we have performed finite element calculations for director configurations of a nematic liquid crystal confined in a torus .",
    "three different types of fixed surface anchoring , according to the toroidal geometry , were investigated .",
    "in addition , an external magnetic field was applied along directions forcing a reorientation of the director in the bulk . with zero magnetic field ,",
    "the director `` escape '' along azimuthal direction turns out to be stable only for transversal - tangential anchoring .",
    "however , it is completely suppressed for homeotropic surface orientation where a configuration containing two defect rings is favored . for transversal - tangential anchoring these ring disclinations are located on the surface of the torus .",
    "when the surface anchoring is along the azimuthal direction , for a magntic field applied along the symmetry axis of the torus , there is a threshold value which must be exceeded in order to force an abrupt reorientation of the bulk director .",
    "our three - dimensional finite element study allows the investigation of director configurations which are not any more axially symmetric . as an example we chose a scenario where a strong homogeneous magnetic field is applied laterally to the torus",
    "the emerging director configuration turns out to contain both the `` escape '' along azimuthal direction and the disclinations , depending on the local azimuthal direction relative to the external magnetic field .",
    "the disclinations are curved , but of finite length , terminating at the intermediate regions where the energy gain due to the `` escape '' structure suppresses the formation of defects .",
    "thereby , the extension of the disclinations depends on the type of surface anchoring .",
    "the system of a nematic confined in a torus is the prototype of a complex geometry which , unlike nematic drops , is not any more simple connected .",
    "finite element calculations in three dimensions is the appropriate technique to determine the equilibrium director configurations in such a system .",
    "therefore , the results obtained can serve as a starting point for the investigation of more advanced scenarios , _",
    "e.g. _ , deformations of the confining torus or the presence of isotropic droplets immersed in the nematic .",
    "the method of finite elements is a means to minimize a functional defined on an arbitrarily complex geometry . in our case , this functional is the reduced elasto - magnetic free energy of a nematic liquid crystal ( [ energydens2 ] ) , depending on the _ tilt _ and _ twist _ angle fields .",
    "we start by subdividing the toroidal volume into @xmath57 small tetrahedron - like finite elements .",
    "the total free energy is then expressed as the sum over the energy content of the @xmath57 finite elements , the director angles now being defined on the @xmath58 vertices of the grid .",
    "each finite element has four corner vertices , thereby , the relation between elements and vertices is established by a neighbor list .",
    "alltogether , this yields the discretized version of the reduced free energy ( [ energydens2 ] ) , @xmath59   = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{l}\\,\\overline{f}_{\\alpha}\\left[\\theta_1^{(\\alpha ) } , \\theta_2^{(\\alpha ) } , \\theta_3^{(\\alpha ) } , \\theta_4^{(\\alpha ) } , \\phi_1^{(\\alpha ) } , \\phi_2^{(\\alpha ) } , \\phi_3^{(\\alpha ) } ,   \\phi_4^{(\\alpha)}\\right].\\ ] ] in ( [ energydiscr ] ) , the sum over @xmath60 runs over all @xmath57 finite elements , @xmath61 is the reduced free energy of the @xmath60-th element .",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 are the director angles on the @xmath64-th corner vertex ( @xmath65 ) of the @xmath60-th element . for calculating @xmath66",
    ", we introduce the oseen - zcher - frank free energy density @xmath67 , according to ( [ energydens2 ] ) , @xmath68.\\ ] ] here , the integral is over the volume of the respective finite element . in order to unify the treatment of the finite elements ,",
