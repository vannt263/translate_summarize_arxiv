    "the interplay of binding and radiative effects in the properties of positronium makes it an interesting case study in pure qed .",
    "in particular , the annihilation of the lowest @xmath4 state of orthopositronium ( o - ps ) into three photons has been studied both experimentally and theoretically since the first calculation of this process by ore and powell@xcite .",
    "most recently manohar and ruiz - femena@xcite have considered the effects of the coulomb interaction on the photon spectrum in the o - ps decay in the region of small photon energies , where these effects are essential . they have found in an integral form the expression for this spectrum , which takes into account to all orders the coulomb interaction between the electron and the positron in the nonrelativistic approximation , and they also argued that their result is applicable in the region of the photon energy , @xmath5 , satisfying the condition @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the mass of the electron .",
    "the present paper contains essentially two further developments over the results of ref.@xcite : a closed analytic formula in terms of just one standard hypergeometric function is given for the spectrum of low energy photons , and it is shown that the condition for its applicability is in fact @xmath8 , i.e. the formula is valid in a significantly broader range of energies than stated in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the region @xmath9 , the expansion parameter for the coulomb effects is @xmath10 , and the first term of this expansion describes the low - energy asymptotic behavior of the one - loop qed corrections to the spectrum . due to the rather slow rise of the coulomb term at low energy it is interesting to also evaluate the constant in @xmath5 term at small @xmath5 in the one - loop correction .",
    "as will be shown here this term can in fact be found from the known in the literature radiative qed corrections to the total rates of decay of the @xmath11 even @xmath12 and @xmath13 states of positronium into two photons .",
    "a comparison of the resulting expression for the first two terms of the expansion in @xmath14 of the @xmath15 correction to the spectrum in the orthopositronium decay with the only available results of a numerical calculation@xcite of this correction is also discussed here .",
    "the spectrum of low - energy photons at @xmath16 lends itself to a nonrelativistic treatment . indeed , after emission of such soft photon from the initial @xmath4 state of o - ps at energy @xmath17 ( relative to the threshold ) , the ( virtual ) @xmath18 pair remains nonrelativistic and is in a @xmath11-even state and has negative energy @xmath19 , which state then annihilates into two hard photons .",
    "this picture can be represented@xcite by the diagram ( of the nonrelativistic perturbation theory ) shown in fig.1 .",
    "the annihilation into two hard gluons takes place at distances @xmath20 , which are considered as infinitesimal in terms of the nonrelativistic relative motion of the electron and the positron .",
    "the green s function at energy @xmath21 , describing the propagation of the pair between the emission of the soft photon and annihilation , thus contains the exponential factor @xmath22 with @xmath23 defined as @xmath24 , so that the discussed process is determined by distances of order @xmath25 and the typical velocities of the electron and positron are given by @xmath26 .",
    "it is well known that in such situation the expansion parameter for the coulomb interaction is @xmath27 .",
    "thus in the region where @xmath23 is comparable with @xmath28 one has to use the exact green s function in the coulomb potential . in the region of larger @xmath23 :",
    "@xmath29 , the nonrelativistic treatment is still applicable as long as @xmath30 , and the coulomb effects can be calculated either by a perturbative expansion of the green s function , or by an expansion of the exact formula , if such formula is available .",
    "[ fig : xy ]    the hamiltonian for the emission of the soft photon in the diagram of fig.1 can be expanded in multipoles .",
    "the dominance of the lowest multipoles is guaranteed by a general consideration@xcite for as long as the system is nonrelativistic , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "however , since at this point the present paper differs from ref.@xcite , it is appropriate to provide here a more detailed discussion",
    ". the @xmath11-even state in fig.1 annihilating into two hard gluons can be either a spin - triplet state with an odd orbital momentum @xmath31 , or a spin - singlet state with an even orbital momentum @xmath32 , where in both cases @xmath33 is a non - negative integer .",
    "for the first set of states the minimal multipole contributing to the transition @xmath34 is of the electric type : @xmath35 , and the amplitude of the transition is proportional to @xmath36 , while for the latter states the lowest multipole is of the magnetic type : @xmath37 , and the amplitude of the transition is proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "the amplitude of the annihilation of a state with orbital momentum @xmath39 at distances @xmath20 contains @xmath39 derivatives of the wave function at the origin , i.e. it is proportional to @xmath40 . multiplying the indicated factors for both sets of the intermediate states , and taking into account that the @xmath22 behavior of the green s function constrains the product @xmath41 at order one",
    ", one readily finds in both cases that the contribution of the corresponding intermediate state in the amplitude described by fig.1 contains the factor @xmath42 .",
    "thus in the nonrelativistic region of @xmath16 it is sufficient to consider only the intermediate states with the lowest @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath43 . clearly , these states are the @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and they are reached from the initial @xmath46 state by respectively @xmath47 and @xmath48 radiative transitions .",
    "it is important to emphasize that both these intermediate states provide contribution of the same order in the nonrelativistic limit@xcite , and also to notice that the spatial extent , @xmath49 , of the initial state of positronium does not enter as a parameter in the discussed multipole expansion the initial state wave function enters only through its value at the origin . ]",
    "using the standard expressions for the hamiltonian of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 interaction , and also using the well known amplitudes of the two - photon annihilation of the @xmath50@xcite and @xmath51@xcite states , one can write the expression for the differential rate of the o - ps annihilation in the limit @xmath52 in the form@xcite = m ^6 9 x  , [ amae ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are respectively the magnetic and electric dipole amplitudes , which can be written in terms of the wave function and of the discussed coulomb green s function @xmath55 as follows , a_m=_0(0 ) g_c(*0 * , * y * ; -^2/m ) _ 0(*y * ) d^3 y  , [ am ] a_e=3 _ 0(0 ) y_i .",
    "|_*x*=0 _ 0(*y * ) d^3 y  .",
    "[ ae ] here @xmath56 stands for the wave function of the initial state of the orthopositronium , and the factor @xmath57 appears in the denominator in both these formulas due to that its value is already included in the normalization in eq.([amae ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the amplitudes @xmath53 and @xmath54 are normalized in such a way that they both are equal to one if the coulomb green s function @xmath58 is replaced by the free motion one @xmath59 , in which limit the lowest - order formula@xcite for the spectrum is reproduced .",
    "the magnetic amplitude @xmath53 is however trivial and is equal to one also if the coulomb interaction is taken into account .",
    "this clearly is a consequence of that the spatial wave function of the ground @xmath46 state is orthogonal to those of all the @xmath44 states except for the ground one , where the overlap integral is equal to one .",
    "the relation @xmath60 is valid up to relativistic terms , including the @xmath61 hyperfine splitting , which effects are beyond the intended accuracy : @xmath62 , was considered in ref.@xcite in order to establish the low - energy behavior mandated by the low theorem . ] .",
    "the integral in eq.([ae ] ) can be calculated using the partial wave expansion of the green s function g_c(*x * , * y * ; e)= _ ( 2 + 1 ) g_(x , y ; e ) p _ ( * x * x y )  , [ gell ] with @xmath63 being the legendre polynomials , and the following representation@xcite of the partial wave green s functions @xmath64 in the coulomb problem : g _ ( x , y ; -^2 m ) = m 2 ( 2 x)^ ( 2y)^ e^-(x+y ) _ n=0^  , [ gcoul ] where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the laguerre polynomials defined as l_n^(p)(z)=e^z z^-p n !",

    "[ lag ] ( usage of this representation can also be found in similar problems in refs . @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "the expression in eq.([ae ] ) contains only the @xmath67 wave partial green s function @xmath68 and thus can be written as @xmath69~. \\label{rsum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here a use is made of the explicit form of the ground state wave function : @xmath70 as well as of the relation @xmath71 . in the last transition the formula ( [ lag ] ) is used to perform integration by parts .",
    "the sum in the latter expression in eq.([rsum ] ) is of the gauss hypergeometric type and can be done explicitly in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath72 , so that the final result can be written as a_e()=(1-)(3 + 5 ) 3 ( 1+)^2 + 8 ^2 ( 1- ) 3 ( 2- ) ( 1 + ) ^3 _ 2f_1 ( 2- , 1 ; 3- ; - 1 - 1 + )  .",
    "[ res ] the explicit relation between the photon energy @xmath5 and the coulomb parameter @xmath73 reads as = m ^2 4 1-^2 ^2=1 2 ry 1-^2 ^2  .",
    "[ omnu ]    the amplitude @xmath54 given by the formula ( [ res ] ) is fully equivalent to its integral representation described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the result in eq.([res ] ) can be expanded in @xmath73 .",
    "the linear term in this expansion describes the correction of the first order in @xmath74 : a_e=1 - 4 3 + o(^2)= 1- 2 3 + o(^2 )  .",
    "[ lin ] when used in eq.([amae ] ) for the differential decay rate the linear term in this expansion determines the asymptotic behavior of the one - loop qed correction to the spectrum at @xmath16 .",
    "however , the slow @xmath75 rise of this correction toward small @xmath76 makes potentially important the higher terms of the expansion in @xmath76 of the @xmath15 one - loop correction . clearly , the relativistic expansion for the discussed terms due to the coulomb interaction goes in powers of @xmath77 , so that the next term of this type is proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "the same behavior is true for the correction terms arising from the full relativistic scattering kernel for the initial state and from the process ( o - ps)@xmath79 .",
    "although the latter two mechanisms together account for almost 85% of the @xmath15 correction to the total rate@xcite , in the spectrum at low @xmath76 their relative contribution starts only as @xmath80 .",
    "such terms are beyond the scope of this paper",
    ".    on the other hand , the constant in @xmath76 term , i.e. of order @xmath81 at small @xmath76 , can be quite readily deduced from the known in the literature results for the one - loop corrections to the total rates of the two photon annihilation of the @xmath11-even @xmath82 and @xmath67 states of the orthopositronium .",
    "these corrections are of genuinely radiative nature and arise from distances of order @xmath83 , as opposed to the so far discussed coulomb effects determined by the electron - positron interaction at distances of order @xmath84 .",
    "the sources of such correction terms can be easily identified from the graph of fig.1 .",
    "indeed , the elements of the considered process determined by the distances of order @xmath83 are the amplitude of the annihilation into two hard photons and the electron magnetic moment entering the hamiltonian of the @xmath47 interaction . accordingly , in order to include the discussed radiative corrections , the equation ( [ amae ] ) should be rewritten as = m ^6 9 x \\ { |a_m|^2 ( g_e 2 ) ^2 ( ^1s_0 2 ) _",
    "0(^1s_0 2 ) + |a_e|^2 }  , [ amae1 ] where @xmath85 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio , and the ratia of the decay rates for the indicated @xmath11-even states are to their values ( @xmath86 ) in the lowest order state due to the landau - yang theorem . ] .",

    "a general calculation of the one - loop qed correction to the spectrum in o - ps decay has been done numerically by adkins@xcite , and it is instructive to compare the two results . for the purpose of such comparison , following the conventions of ref.@xcite , we write the formula for the differential probability in the form d x=_0(x ) + _ 1(x )  .",
