    "colloids are widely used as model systems to study fundamental questions of statistical mechanics . over the past twenty - five years the phase behaviour , phase transition kinetics and glass transition of colloidal suspensions have been observed in numerous experiments and modelled by means of theory and simulations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the interest in colloids in their own right , it is often argued that colloids could serve as model systems for atomic and molecular substances @xcite .",
    "indeed , colloids can be designed to resemble atoms in many aspects of their equlibrium structure and phase behaviour .",
    "but there is a major difference in their dynamics : colloidal particles are suspended in a solvent .",
    "they interact directly with each other ( e.g.  by excluded volume ) as well as indirectly by means of momentum transfer via the solvent .",
    "the latter phenomenon ( `` hydrodynamic interaction '' ) is well known and thoroughly studied in the context of colloidal flow and sedimentation @xcite .",
    "but when colloids are used as model systems for phase transition kinetics or for the glass transition , hydrodynamic interactions are often neglected @xcite .    in this article",
    "we address the effect of hydrodynamic interactions on crystal nucleation in suspensions of colloidal hard spheres . since the pioneering experiments of pusey and van megen in the 1980s @xcite crystal nucleation in hard spheres has been observed in numerous experiments and simulations .",
    "strikingly , the nucleation rate densities obtained by computer simulation differ by orders of magnitude from those observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for this discrepancy has not been understood yet . up to now , no simulation study on this topic has taken into account hydrodynamic interactions @xcite . thus it makes sense to ask whether the solvent , which is inevitably present in the experiments , is the reason for the discrepancy .",
    "nucleation is commonly described by classical nucleation theory or extensions thereof .",
    "this type of theory relies on the notion of a free energy lanscape in which the system moves , i.e.  it is based on the assumption that during the phase transition process there is a small number of macroscopic observables which vary slowly ( e.g.  the size of the largest crystallite ) , while all other degrees of freedom are equilibrated very quickly . under this assumption",
    "the nucleation process can be modelled in terms of transition state theory : the nucleation rate density i(t ) is then given by the product of the boltzman weight of the height of the free energy barrier associated with the formation of a critical nucleus , @xmath0 , and a kinetic prefactor @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 in the context of crystallization of a colloidal hard sphere suspension this implies that the dynamics of the solvent only enter the kinetic prefactor , because the height of the barrier is determinded completely by equilibrium properties of the hard spheres .",
    "if the process by which particles are attached to the crystal nucleus were purely diffusive , then the self - diffusion time would be the only relevant time - scale entering the kinetic pre - factor .",
    "we have simulated systems containing @xmath3 hard spheres at volume fractions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 suspended in a solvent .",
    "the solvent was modelled by means of multi - particle collision - dynamics ( mpcd ) @xcite .",
    "the starting configurations were prepared in the supersaturated liquid state and we verified that they did not contain crystalline precursors .",
    "then we simulated 40 independent trajectories per value of solvent viscosity until crystallization was reached in all cases .",
    "for @xmath6 and @xmath7 we observe an induction period that is long compared to the diffusion times of the system followed by a regime of rapid growth .",
    "hence , for these two volume fractions , we are confident that we are dealing with nucleation .",
    "when carrying out the simulations , we did not wish to make any assumptions on the evolution of the density of states or the length of correlation - times involved in the nucleation process . in particular , we wanted to allow for processes that might involve other `` slow '' coordinates than the size of the largest nucleus . therefore  in contrast to other simulation studies on hard spheres @xcite  we did not use any free energy based sampling scheme to speed up the simulations .",
    "we present all data in units of the sphere diameter @xmath8 , the mass of a sphere @xmath9 and the thermal energy @xmath10 ( these are the intrinsic units of the mpcd program , see methods section ) .",
    "solvent viscosities range between approximately @xmath11 and @xmath12 . translated to an experimental system with colloidal particles of radius @xmath13 suspended in a solvent of mass density @xmath14 at room temperature , these viscosities correspond to a range of @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "[ fig : iunscaled ] shows the nucleation rate density versus viscosity .",
    "if the time - scale entering the kinetic pre - factor was determined by the diffusion of the spheres only , the nucleation rate density would drop as @xmath17 .",
    "the simulation data for the two lower volume fractions in fig  [ fig : iunscaled ] clearly deviate from a @xmath17-law for high viscosities .",
    "hence we conclude that hydrodynamic interactions speed up the nucleation process @xcite .    for a consistency check fig .",
    "[ fig : diffcoeffs ] shows the long - time self - diffusion constants in the infinitely dilute system @xmath18 , and the long - time self - diffusion constant in the supersaturated suspension @xmath19 .",
    "both diffusion constants follow the expected @xmath17-behaviour .",
    "experimentally , hard sphere suspensions are synthesized in various ways .",
    "common systems are polystyrene spheres suspended in water , and sterically stabilized polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) spheres in an organic liquid such as decalin .",
    "typical solvent viscosities are in the range of @xmath20 . when simulation data is compared with experiments  or when experiments of chemically different composition are compared to one another  the solvent is usually taken into account by normalizing the nucleation rate density with respect to either @xmath19 or @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "as argued above , this procedure is based on the assumption that the nucleation process can be described by transition state theory with a kinetic prefactor that contains purely diffusive attachment dynamics  fig .",
    "[ fig : iunscaled ] clearly shows that this assumption does not hold .    for a quantitative comparison between simulation and experiment , fig .",
    "[ fig : id0dl ] shows the nucleation rate densities rescaled with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "the green star is a computer simulation result for hard spheres without a solvent , in which the spheres moved ballistically and collided elastically .",
    "( the star hence corresponds to @xmath22 .",
    "we placed it at a very small , non - zero value of @xmath23 instead to include it in the log - log presentation ) .",
    "the other symbols indicate experimentally measured nucleation rate densities .",
    "we conclude that the long debated difference between simulation results and experimental results is most probably due to solvent hydrodynamics .",
    "to validate this statement it would be desirable to compare nucleation rate densities for different values of supersaturation .",
    "the discrepancy between the experimental data and the simulation results increases for decreasing supersaturation@xcite .",
    "we could simulate lower supersaturations because the computation times became forbiddingly long , but we have computed nucleation rate densities for a higher supersaturation ( see crosses in fig  [ fig : iunscaled ] . ) for @xmath24 the data follows a @xmath17-law . hence , in agreement with the data shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the effect vanishes at very high supersaturations .    as the nucleation rate densities are affected by hydrodynamic interactions , one could expect to observe differences in the sizes , shapes or structures of the crystallites that form , too .",
    "we analysed the structures of the growing crystallites in terms of their @xmath25-bond - order @xcite .",
    "[ fig : q6q6distr ] shows @xmath26 for pairs of particles @xmath27 and @xmath28 in clusters of equal sizes obtained at different solvent viscosities .",
    "the crystallites are very similar in structure . within the statistical accuracy ,",
    "the radii of gyration of the crystallites did not differ , either .",
    "we also performed a committor analysis for the highest and the lowest viscosity and did not find any difference in the critical cluster size , shape or structure .",
    "this observation proves that a description of the crystal nucleation process in terms of transition state theory is adequate .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions , however , influence the kinetic pre - factor .",
    "in summary , we have simulated crystallization from a supersaturated liquid suspension of hard spheres taking into account the solvent hydrodynamics .",
    "we find that kinetics need to be taken with care when one studies phase transitions in colloids .",
    "contrary to what has been assumed in the literature so far , the crystal nucleation rate densities do not drop as the inverse viscosity , i.e.  the attachment dynamics are not purely diffusive . the structure and shape of the critical nucleus",
    "are independent of solvent viscosity , hence a description in terms of transition state theory is adequate .",
    "but the kinetic pre - factor is affected by hydrodynamic interactions",
    ". it would be very interesting to see a test of this effect in an experiment on hard spheres suspended in a solvent of a different chemical composition than commonly used .",
    "to simulate hard spheres suspeded in a liquid , we used a combination of an event - driven molecular dynamics ( edmd ) algorithm @xcite for the spheres and multiparticle - collision dynamics ( mpcd ) @xcite as a mesoscopic solvent model to account for the hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the basic idea of a mpcd algorithm is to transport momentum through the system by means of point particles of mass @xmath9 while satisfying the conservation laws of mass , energy and momentum locally .",
    "the algorithm consists of two steps , namely free streaming interrupted by multiparticle collisions . in the streaming step ,",
    "all fluid particles are propagated ballistically for a time - interval of length @xmath29 .",
    "then the fluid particles are sorted into a lattice of cubic cells of size @xmath30 and the particle velocities are rotated around the center of mass velocity in this cell . before a collision step is carried out , the collision cell grid is shifted by a randomly chosen vector with components taken from the interval @xmath31 $ ] , to ensure galilean invariance @xcite .",
    "the solvent viscosity is varied by varying the duration @xmath29 of the ballistic flight .    in order to measure the solvent viscosities we imposed a poiseuille flow between two planar walls . from the resulting parabolic velocity field we extracted @xmath23 .",
    "+ we identified crystallites by means of the `` q6q6-bond order parameter '' @xcite . for a sphere @xmath27 with @xmath32 neighbors ,",
    "local 6-fold bond - orientational order is characterized by @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the spherical harmonics for @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the position vector between a sphere @xmath27 and its neighbour @xmath28 .",
    "a vector @xmath37 is assigned to each sphere , the elements of which are defined as @xmath38 if a sphere had more than 9 neighbours with @xmath39 it was considered `` crystalline ''",
    ". +   +   + once a run had produced a crystalline cluster of more than 80 particles , it definitely crystallized .",
    "thus we used this value to locate the nucleation time . to test the validity of this criterion",
    ", we performed a commitor analysis for two values of viscosity ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "we found that a cluster size of ca .",
    "30 particles corresponds to a 50% probability for subsequent full crystallization in both cases . as the growth process is very fast , the induction times extracted from the commitor analysis hardly differ from those obtained by means of the `` 80-particle criterion '' .",
    "we took the arithmetic mean of the distribution of measured induction times @xmath42 to determine the nucleation rate density , and its standard deviation to determine the error bars . the nucleation rate density is then given by @xmath43 where v is the volume of the system .",
    "+   +   + to determine @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) we computed the mean squared displacement of a particle in the infinitely dilute ( resp .",
    "the dense ) solution versus time and fitted a straight line to it .",
    "the result for @xmath18 was consistent with the shear viscosity @xmath23 that we had measured independently , see above .",
