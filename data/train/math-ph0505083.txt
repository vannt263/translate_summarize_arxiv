    "the momentum of a particle moving in a weakly random hamiltonian field approaches in the long time limit the brownian motion on the level set of the hamiltonian in the momentum space .",
    "the position of the particle follows the trajectory generated by this momentum process .",
    "this limit has been first investigated rigorously by kesten and papanicolaou in @xcite in dimension @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , they have considered a hamiltonian of the form @xmath1 with a spatially homogeneous and mixing random field @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding particle trajectories are @xmath4 as the random potential is weak , its effect becomes appreciable over large times  of the order @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , we introduce the re - scaled process @xmath6 , @xmath7 that satisfies @xmath8 kesten and papanicolaou have shown that the process @xmath9 converges in law as @xmath10 to a brownian motion @xmath11 on the sphere @xmath12 .",
    "the process @xmath13 converges ( also in law ) to @xmath14 , the time integral of @xmath11 : @xmath15 later , drr , goldstein and lebowitz have considered the two - dimensional case @xcite with a potential @xmath2 of the form @xmath16 here @xmath17 are the locations of randomly distributed poisson scatterers and @xmath18 is a compactly supported sufficiently smooth potential .",
    "they used a martingale technique to establish a result similar to that of kesten and papanicolaou in this case .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to prove the diffusive limit in the general two - dimensional setting with the same assumptions on the random potential as in the original paper of kesten and papanicolaou .",
    "we recall that their proof was based on the following method .",
    "the main difficulty in obtaining the limit is that the random potential is time - independent , hence the time increments of @xmath13 may be correlated : this happens when the trajectory comes close to its own past . to handle this issue",
    "one modifies the trajectories of the hamiltonian system in such a way that the modified system has a better chance of being markovian in time .",
    "the modification guarantees two properties : ( i ) the new trajectories will always go away from the regions of the physical space that they have just visited , and ( ii ) self - intersections do not lead to `` gaining information about the past '' .",
    "the former is achieved by keeping momenta aligned locally in time , and the second by making the trajectory a straight line during the time of a self - intersection .",
    "this ensures that the modified process always sees `` a new randomness '' because of the spatial mixing properties of the random potential .",
    "hence , the increments of the momentum variations are nearly independent and in the limit the modified momentum process becomes a diffusion .",
    "next , one observes that the limit diffusion in dimensions @xmath0 does stay away from its past .",
    "hence , so does the modified trajectory process before the limit @xmath10 as it is close to the aforementioned diffusion .",
    "the last step is to observe that until the trajectory comes close to its past no modification has to be made  the original and modified processes coincide .",
    "but we have shown that the modified process does not approach its past  therefore , neither does the original process as they are one and the same until the self - intersection .",
    "hence , the process without any modification is also close to the limit diffusion , simply because the modifications were never actually made .",
    "this finishes the original proof of @xcite .",
    "we mention that recently we have been able to modify this method in @xcite to control the particle behavior on a longer time scale and show that then the spatial component itself converges to a brownian motion in @xmath19 .",
    "the proof of @xcite breaks down in two dimensions simply because the limit process does intersect itself  this means that so does the process before the limit and the near markovianity of the original trajectories of the hamiltonian system is seemingly destroyed .",
    "however , intuitively , there is some room even in two dimensions ",
    "one should avoid not all self - intersections but rather only non - transversal self - intersections as these cause the path to follow its past for a long time creating strong correlations with the past .",
    "moreover , a non - transversal self - intersection in the physical two - dimensional space is a self - intersection of the full @xmath20-trajectory in the three - dimensional ( two spatial dimensions plus the momentum direction ) phase space . the expected joint limit process @xmath20  @xmath11 is a brownian motion on the circle and @xmath14 is its time integral  does not intersect itself .",
    "this allows us to use the same strategy as in @xcite to push the proof through in two dimensions .",
    "the main technical difficulty and novelty of this paper is in the aforementioned control of non - transversal self - intersections of the trajectories and in the proof that this weaker constraint suffices to establish the limit .",
    "the one - dimensional case is very different from @xmath21 ",
    "see @xcite for a recent discussion of this problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we introduce and study the modified dynamics in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "section [ sec : fin ] contains the proof of proposition [ lma1 ] which is the main technical estimate that shows that the modified process with the cut - offs is close to the momentum diffusion .",

    "[ thm2-main ] suppose that the random field @xmath94 satisfies the assumptions made in section @xmath147 .",
    "assume also that @xmath148 .",
    "then , the laws @xmath149 converge weakly , as @xmath150 , to @xmath151 .",
    "the overall strategy of the proof of theorem [ thm2-main ] is similar to that in @xcite .",
    "briefly , it can be summarized as follows .",
    "the hamiltonian system ( [ eq1b ] ) is modified in such a way that the particle can not `` turn back violently '' .",
    "this ensures that the particle `` moves forward '' , at least locally in time .",
    "this was done by multiplying the right side of ( [ eq1b ] ) by a cut - off function @xmath152 that depends both on the current position @xmath20 and on the past trajectory @xmath153 .",
    "more precisely , one introduces a time mesh @xmath154  the function @xmath155 is equal to zero on the time interval @xmath156 $ ] if the momentum @xmath11 is far from @xmath157 .",
    "this keeps momenta aligned on the time scale @xmath158 and propels the particle forward .",
    "the second cut - off requires that if @xmath14 , @xmath159 $ ] is close to @xmath160 with @xmath161 then @xmath162 and dynamics is trivial .",
    "the latter assumption ensures that `` no information is gained '' at self - intersections . using the improved mixing properties of the modified dynamics it is possible to show that the modified process converges to the fokker - planck diffusion with the generator ( [ 61102b ] ) . the last step is to observe that for a diffusion in dimension @xmath0 the cut - off @xmath163 for a very long time :",
    "it does not make a violent turn on a short time interval , nor does it come close to its past trajectory . therefore , the modified process , being close to diffusion , also does neither of those things . hence the stopping times , associated with the first violent turn and coming back , tend to infinity for the modified process .",
    "however , until the stopping time the laws of the true process and of its modification , coincide , therefore the stopping time for the original process also tends to infinity , and we conclude that the law of the momentum of the true solution of the hamiltonian system also approaches the law of the brownian motion on a sphere as @xmath164 .    as we have mentioned in the introduction , the two - dimensional case requires a special treatment because the limit diffusion intersects its past  hence the idea of `` always seeing a new randomness '' may not work .",
    "however , one can show that the limit process does not intersect the past trajectory nearly tangentially .",
    "therefore , the time it stays close to its past is small  this provides the key hope for the proof .",
    "accordingly , we modify the kesten - papanicolaou self - intersection cut - off : the particle is forced to go along the straight line ( `` no information gain '' ) only if it intersects the past trajectory non - transversally .",
    "transversal intersections undergo the original dynamics .",
    "the non - transversality condition of self - intersections is formalized as follows .",
    "first , we set - up the mesh @xmath165 on which we require the momentum alignment , as in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we set - up a finer mesh @xmath166 with @xmath167 and impose that @xmath168 if at time @xmath110 the position @xmath14 is close to @xmath169 with @xmath170 and the directions @xmath171 and @xmath172 are nearly aligned . since non - transversality is checked only for times on the @xmath173-mesh , we have to introduce an additional cut - off that requires the momenta to be aligned on this time scale .",
    "this means that the momenta at self - intersections are transversal to those at all times on the interval @xmath174 $ ] , and not only the discrete times on the mesh .",
    "that allows one to bound the total time spent near the past trajectory in the modified dynamics : see proposition  [ prop10402 ] .",
    "this bound allows us to bound the `` correlation gain '' at self - intersections and proceed to the next step ",
    "we establish an approximate martingale equality in proposition  [ lma1 ] for the modified dynamics .",
    "however , this property holds only with some time delay : @xmath175 with an appropriate @xmath176  this forces us to introduce a third time mesh @xmath177 as well as cut - offs that prohibit a violent turn on this time scale .",
    "this is required to control the times when the approximate martingale equality fails .",
    "the rest of the proof is similar to @xcite : we consider a concatenated process .",
    "it follows the modified dynamics until the stopping time , when one of the aforementioned events occur , and the limit diffusion after this time .",
    "we use the approximate martingale property of the modified process to show that the concatenated process converges to the correct diffusive limit .",
    "that means that the stopping time for the concatenated process has to go to infinity as @xmath10 .",
    "however , until the stopping time the concatenated , modified and original processes all coincide , hence the modified process also has the right limit , as well as the original dynamics , and the proof is complete .",
    "in this section we introduce the modified dynamics and establish the tightness of the family of processes with the cut - offs .",
    "first , we explain the stopping times that we will need in the proof of theorem [ thm2-main ] .",
    "let @xmath178 , @xmath179 be certain positive constants .",
    "we set @xmath180,\\quad p_2=p_1\\,[\\delta^{-{\\epsilon}_2}],\\quad p_3:=p_1[\\delta^{-{\\epsilon}_3 } ] , \\quad p_4:=[\\delta^{-{\\epsilon}_4}],\\ ] ] @xmath181,\\quad n_2:=n_4[\\delta^{-{\\epsilon}_6 } ] , \\quad n_3:=[\\delta^{-{\\epsilon}_7}],\\quad n_4:=[\\delta^{-{\\epsilon}_8}].\\ ] ] we will specify the restrictions on the constants @xmath178 as the need for such constraints arises .",
    "however , the basic requirement is that they should be sufficiently small . at this time",
    "we assume only that all the parameters appearing in are less than @xmath182 .",
    "this forces upon us the assumptions @xmath183 we introduce the following @xmath184stopping times .",
    "consider a path @xmath185 and let @xmath186 , @xmath187 .",
    "we define the three `` violent turn '' stopping times on each scale corresponding to the mesh sizes @xmath188 , @xmath187 : @xmath189.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this ensures that during a time interval of length @xmath190 the particle momentum does not change by more than @xmath191  the particle goes forward .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath192 , @xmath187 , which holds if @xmath193 this condition guarantees that the expected limit diffusion process should have the same property .",
    "note that for any path @xmath194 the condition @xmath195 implies @xmath196  hence until the stopping time the momenta directions are aligned on the corresponding time scales .",
    "this fact follows from an elementary inequality @xmath197 for arbitrary @xmath198 satisfying @xmath199 .",
    "we note that both in the definition of the stopping times above and elsewhere we adopt the convention that the infimum of an empty set equals @xmath200 .",
    "finally , we set the stopping times @xmath208 and @xmath209      we define first the cut - off functions needed for the `` no violent turn '' stopping times .",
    "let @xmath31 be fixed and suppose that the function @xmath210 $ ] is of the @xmath211 class and such that @xmath212 let also @xmath213 $ ] be a @xmath211 class function that in addition satisfies @xmath214 one can construct @xmath215 in such a way that for arbitrary nonnegative integers @xmath216 there exists a constant @xmath217 so that @xmath218 , @xmath219 .",
