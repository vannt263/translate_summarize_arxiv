    "the canonical lattice model of the configurations of a polymer in solution has been the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) where configurations are those lattice paths that could be generated by a random walk on a lattice that is not allowed to visit the same lattice site more than once . considered as a static equilibrium statistical mechanical ensemble",
    ", self - avoiding walks display an excluded volume effect : they are swollen in size if compared to the set of unrestricted random walks of the same length . a common way to model intra - polymer interactions",
    "is to assign an energy to each non - consecutive pair of monomers lying on neighbouring lattice sites .",
    "this prescription defines the interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) model , which is the standard lattice model of polymer collapse using self - avoiding walks .",
    "the collapse transition in isaw models , the so - called @xmath0-point of polymers , is a second order phase transition that has been well studied .",
    "the standard theory @xcite of the collapse transition is based on the @xmath1 limit of the magnetic tri - critical @xmath2 o(@xmath3 ) field theory and related edwards model with two and three body forces @xcite , which predicts an upper critical dimension of three with subtle scaling behaviour in that dimension .",
    "a physically equivalent way of obtaining the excluded volume in a random walk model is to prevent the walk from visiting the same _ bond _ more than once .",
    "this weaker restriction leads to another class of lattice paths called self - avoiding trails ( sat ) .",
    "the interacting version of trails , customarily obtained by giving a weight to multiply occupied sites , also presents a collapse transition .",
    "the literature contains various definitions @xcite of single energy models of interacting self - avoiding trails ( isat ) , all weighting multiply visited sites in different ways ( they differ in how sites visited more than twice are assigned the energy of interaction ) . regardless , theoretical prediction @xcite and the evidence @xcite suggests that the collapse transition of the isat model is in a different universality class to that of isaw , although there is no clear understanding of why this is the case if true .    on the other hand , a two - dimensional model ( triangular lattice ) of an extended isat ( eisat ) model , where doubly and triply visited sites are given",
    "_ different _ energies , say @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , was recently @xcite shown to display a rich phase diagram with first and second order collapse separated by a multi - critical point .",
    "the occurrence of the type of transition depended on the ratio @xmath6 of the energies given to multiply visited sites of different degree .    in conjunction with this study a stochastic process , known as kinetic growth trails ( kgt ) ,",
    "was also considered , where configurations of trails are produced by a growth process .",
    "the static configurations produced are trails , but the trails of a fixed length are not all produced with equal probability .",
    "the equivalent static model is an eisat with a particular value of @xmath7 at one particular temperature @xmath8 .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that this value of @xmath9 separates models where the collapse transition is first order ( @xmath10 ) from models where the collapse transition is second order ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "it was shown that for @xmath12 the second order transition was most likely in a single universality class , which was the same as the one in the ( two - dimensional ) isaw @xmath0-point collapse transition .",
    "moreover , the kgt process mapped exactly onto the transition point separating the two lines of first and second order transition . defining the temperature of the transition in the eisat model to be @xmath13 , it was deduced that @xmath14 also , importantly it was found that while the second order transition encountered for small @xmath15 had a low temperature phase that was globular , the low temperature phase at large @xmath15 was crystal - like , in that the trail filled the lattice .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a counterpart to the triangular lattice eisat model on the simple cubic lattice .",
    "one reason for choosing",
    "the simple cubic lattice is that the coordination number is the same as on the triangular lattice .",
    "this means that if one considers a kinetic growth process kgt on the simple cubic lattice it will map to precisely that same location in the phase diagram of the three - dimensional model as the corresponding triangular lattice model described above .",
    "also the kgt on the simple cubic lattice has previously been studied @xcite : it demonstrates a scaling behaviour consistent with it mapping to a critical point in the phase diagram of eisat . one might then speculate that the phase diagram of the eisat on the cubic lattice has the same structure as on the triangular lattice",
    "however , we find there are important differences , including anomalous finite size scaling behaviour around the kgt point , and no evidence of any crystal - like low temperature phase .",
    "the paper is set out as follows .",
    "we begin by recalling the theoretical framework of the collapse transition .",
    "we then move onto defining the models including the extended isat ( eisat ) model on a general regular lattice , specifically on the triangular and cubic lattices , the various canonical isat models and the kgt process . before describing our results for the cubic lattice",
    "we summarise the findings on the triangular lattice .",
    "there are two related ways of describing the collapse .",
    "one is by understanding the change in finite length @xmath3 scaling of key quantities such as the radius of gyration , or alternatively end - to - end distance , and partition function as the temperature is lowered past the transition temperature @xmath16 .",
    "the second is the associated singular thermodynamic behaviour in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath17 ) of the free energy per step and in the internal energy and/or specific heat at that same temperature .",
    "let us first describe the finite size scaling change . as the temperature",
    "is varied there is a collapse transition at some @xmath18 . for high temperatures ( @xmath19 )",
    "the excluded volume interaction is the dominant effect , and the behaviour is universally the same as the non - interacting saw problem .",
    "the mean squared end - to - end distance @xmath20 and partition function @xmath21 are therefore expected to scale as @xmath22 respectively with estimates of @xmath23 and @xmath24 to be @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite in three dimensions .    when fixed at the transition temperature @xmath27 for isaw in three dimensions , tri - critical field theory and the edwards model @xcite predict similar scaling forms with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , though with additive logarithmic corrections .    at low temperatures ( @xmath30 )",
    "it is accepted that the partition function is dominated by configurations that are internally dense .",
    "the partition function should then scale differently to that at high temperature , since a collapsed polymer should have a well defined surface ( and associated surface energy ) .",
    "one expects @xcite in three dimensions asymptotics of the form @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "so the exponent @xmath33 and the fractal dimension of the polymer becomes @xmath34 .",
    "this change in scaling behaviour is reflected in the thermodynamic limit . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "there is expected to be a singularity in the free energy , which can be seen in its second derivative ( the specific heat ) . denoting the ( intensive ) finite length specific heat _ per monomer _ by @xmath35 , the thermodynamic limit is given by the long length limit as @xmath36 in general",
    "one expects that the singular part of the specific heat behaves as @xmath37 where @xmath38 for a second - order phase transition .",
    "the singular part of the thermodynamic limit internal energy behaves as @xmath39 if the transition is second - order , and there is a jump in the internal energy if the transition is first - order ( an effective value of @xmath40 ) .",

    "we shall define this exponent @xmath44 , via @xmath51 we use the same symbol @xmath44 because in a crossover theory the exponent will be the same @xmath44 as described in ( [ crossover ] ) . for a first order transition one",
    "expects that both @xmath44 and @xmath47 are 1 . for a second order transition in the standard scaling picture one expects the two exponents to be equal , @xmath52 , although we note a breaking down of the standard scaling has been already observed in @xcite in high dimensions .    for the isaw model",
    "the tri - critical field theory expects the width ( crossover ) exponent @xmath53 and shift exponent @xmath54 with logarithmic corrections present in the scaling forms because the system is at the upper critical dimension .",
    "the value of the specific heat exponent @xmath55 is consistent with the scaling relation ( [ tricritical ] ) , as a logarithmically divergent specific heat @xcite is predicted , @xmath56 the prediction @xcite for the shift is @xmath57    on the other hand shapir and oono @xcite have argued that the isat collapse transition should be tri - critical in nature , as self - avoiding walks .",
    "however they predict that isaw and isat are in different universality classes .",
    "importantly , while the upper critical dimension for isaw is expected to be @xmath58 , the shapir - oono field theory gives @xmath59 for isat .",
    "on a lattice with coordination number greater than 3 the self - interaction in the trail model can be implemented in different ways , depending on how the weight associated with contact site depends on how many times the site has been visited . the canonical isat model , which has been defined differently by different authors , fixes the energy associated with sites visited more than twice based upon the energy of doubly visited sites .",
    "the eisat is a generalised model that allows for different ( independent ) energies to be associated with multiply visited sites of different multiplicities .",
    "consider a regular lattice of coordination number @xmath60 @xmath61 and the configurations @xmath62 of trails of length @xmath3 ( bonds ) starting from a fixed origin .",
    "let @xmath63 be the energy associated with lattice sites that have been visited @xmath64 times by the trail .",
    "now let @xmath65 be the number of lattice sites that have been visited @xmath64 times by the trail .",
    "note that one always has @xmath66 .",
    "hence , to each of these contact sites is associated an boltzmann weight @xmath67 with @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the inverse temperature in suitable units of the inverse boltzmann constant .",
    "the partition function is then given by : @xmath70 and the probability distribution by @xmath71    we define a reduced finite - size free energy per step as @xmath72 related to the usual free energy per step as @xmath73 .    the average of any quantity @xmath74 over the ensemble of allowed paths @xmath75 of length @xmath3 is given generically by @xmath76 the thermodynamic limit in this problem is given by the limit @xmath77 , so that the thermodynamic free energy per step @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 this quantity determines the asymptotic behaviour of the partition function , i.e. , @xmath21 grows to leading order exponentially as @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "both the triangular and simple cubic lattices have coordination number 6 .",
    "therefore only two weights , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , appear in the formulae ( [ eq : general - isat - z ] ) and ( [ eq : pe ] ) .    in order to explore the two - parameter space of the eisat",
    "we define a one - parameter family of models with weights defined by : @xmath84 for any positive real value of the parameter @xmath15 , that is , the energies obey @xmath85 in the @xmath15-eisat model .",
    "we set the energy @xmath86 for convenience from now on .    in this parametrisation",
    "we define a reduced internal energy per step and a reduced specific heat per step in the usual way via @xmath87    let us define the collapse transition as occurring at @xmath88 so that we expect for fixed @xmath15 that @xmath89 if crossover scaling occurs .",
    "more generally the shift exponent is defined by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the location of the peak of the specific heat , and the width exponent by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the width of the half - height of the peak of the specific heat .",
    "both these exponents could depend on @xmath15 .      the canonical model used by doukas _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite is one where every successive visit to a site adds an energy @xmath94 to the total for that site so that a @xmath95-times visited sites has energy @xmath96 .",

    "we find that the collapse is second - order if @xmath12 and first - order if @xmath10 .",
    "this resembles the triangular lattice finding ( although the nature of the second order transition is different ) .",
    "interestingly , the low temperature phase for both @xmath11 and @xmath161 seems to be a disordered globular state .",
    "exactly at @xmath202 , the finite size scaling picture is particularly intriguing : the energy distribution displays a double peak form , indicating a first order type transition but we observe different values for the _ shift _ exponent @xmath203 and the _ width _ ( _ crossover _ ) exponent @xmath204 . the thermodynamic limit location of this first order transition when @xmath140 is the temperature @xmath205 that maps to the kinetic growth process .",
    "however , if one simulates directly at the point @xmath9 and @xmath8 then the finite size scaling encountered is entirely second - order like and shows no sign of the first - order transition which dominates in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this can be understood by appreciating that the finite size transition region shrinks quicker than its centre approaches the limiting temperature .",
    "these results help to illuminate previous contradictory work for interacting trails on the diamond lattice @xcite .",
    "as the coordination number of the diamond lattice equals 4 , trails can only interact through doubly visited sites .",
    "the collapse point of interacting trails on the diamond lattice at @xmath206 was identified with the kinetic growth process . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the scaling of the specific heat at the kinetic growth points for the diamond and simple cubic lattices was indistinguishable .",
    "however , simulations of interacting trails on the diamond lattice showed the emergence of a first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "the scenario we describe here for kgt on the simple cubic lattice clearly mimics these results .",
    "we are now able to understand the existence of both of these behaviours through the breaking of crossover scaling .",
    "one last observation we can make is that interacting trails have been simulated in high dimensions @xcite and also demonstrate the breakdown of crossover scaling .",
    "the behaviour in high dimensions has been shown to be consistent with a self - consistent mean - field theory , which also displays bimodal energy distributions , though these do not lead to real first - order transitions in high dimensions .",
    "while that theory can not not be applicable to @xmath9 in three dimensions ( it predicts shift and width exponents both equal to @xmath207 ) , it would be interesting to formulate a mean - field theory of the transition that occurs for our eisat model when @xmath9 .",
    "consequently this may imply that the upper critical dimension for the @xmath9 eisat models is less than three , and may in fact be two . here",
    "we point out the numerical observation of confluent logarithms in the two - dimensional kinetic growth trails @xcite , lending further support to that assertion as logarithmic corrections typically appear at the upper critical dimension of a phase transition .",
