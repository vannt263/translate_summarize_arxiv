    "during the last decades there has been considerable progress in describing social systems based on physical notions and mathematical formalism developed in statistical physics and applied mathematics ( for a recent review see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in particle , the notion of energy functional ( hamiltonian ) and the corresponding master equation were employed to simulate opinion dynamics , the dynamics of culture and languages ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; the social force model inheriting the basic concepts from newtonian mechanics was used to simulate traffic flow , pedestrian motion , the motion of bird flocks , fish school , swarms of social insects ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a detailed review on other techniques based on kinetic theory , fluid dynamics , the ginsburg - landau equations , etc . applied to traffic flow and similar problems",
    "can be found also in refs .",
    "@xcite . continuing the list of examples , we note the application of the lotka - volterra model and the related reaction - diffusion systems to stock market , income distribution , population dynamics @xcite .",
    "the replicator equations developed initially in the theory of species evolution were applied to the moral dynamics @xcite . the notion of a fixed - point attractor as a stable equilibrium point in the system dynamics that corresponds to some local minimum in a certain potential relief",
    "is widely met in social psychology @xcite .",
    "the latter is extended even to collections of such fixed point attractors to form a basin .",
    "besides , social psychology uses the notion of latent attractors ( i.e. invisible ones under the equilibrium and whose presence affects strong perturbations ) , periodic attractors representing limit cycles , and deterministic chaos .",
    "in addition , the concept of synchronization of interacting oscillators was used to model social coordination @xcite .    in spite of these achievements we have to note that the mathematical theory of social systems is currently at its initial stage of development . indeed , animate beings and objects of the inanimate world are highly different in their basic features , in particular , such notions as willingness , learning , prediction , motives for action , moral norms , personal and cultural values are just inapplicable to inanimate objects .",
    "this enables us to pose a question as to what _",
    "individual _ physical notions and mathematical formalism should be developed to describe social systems in addition to the available ones inherited from modern physics .",
    "for example , kerner s hypothesis about the _ continuous _ multitude of metastable states representing the synchronized phase of traffic flow , on one hand , stimulated developing the three - phase traffic model explaining a number of observed phenomena in congested traffic flow @xcite . on the other hand , a _",
    "microscopic _ mechanism enabling the coexistence of many different metastable states actually at the same point of the corresponding phase space is up to know a challenging problem .",
    "the present paper discusses one of such notions , namely , the fuzzy rationality which is a specific implementation of the bounded capacity of human cognition @xcite .",
    "its particular goal is to demonstrate that the fuzzy rationality can be responsible for complex emergent phenomena in social systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : frge ] provides an explanation for the basic ideas and mathematical constructions to be used in formulating the main model in sec .",
    "[ sec : lbm ] .",
    "results of its numerical simulation and their discussion are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : nm ] .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "to elucidate the problem at hand , this section considers a simple imaginary system governed by an operator ( individual ) , for example , a person driving a car .",
    "the dynamics of the given system is represented as the motion of a point @xmath0 on a phase plane @xmath1 .",
    "we presume that if the operator was able to govern the system perfectly following a certain optimal strategy then its dynamics would be described by the coupled equations    [ int:1 ] @xmath2    here @xmath3 is a time scale characterizing the operator perception delay , the `` forces '' @xmath4 and @xmath5 are determined by _ both _ the physical regularities of the system mechanics and the active behavior of the operator in controlling the system motion .",
    "the origin @xmath6 of the coordinate frame is placed at the equilibrium point of system  , i.e. , the equalities @xmath7 are assumed to hold . in this context",
    "the perfect rationality of the operator means his ability to locate precisely the current position of the system on the phase plane @xmath1 , to predict strictly its further motion , and , then , to correct the current motion continuously .",
    "exactly in this case it is possible to consider that the operator orders the strategies of behavior according to their preference and then chooses the optimal one . as a result the equilibrium point @xmath6 must be stable when the aim of operator actions is to keep the system in close vicinity to this point ( fig .",
    "[ f1]a , b ) .     of the system considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : frge ] ( a ) ; a schematic illustration of its dynamics near the stable equilibrium point @xmath6 in the cases of the perfect rationality ( b ) and the fuzzy rationality ( c , d ) . here , not to overload the drawings ,",
    "the frame origin is shifted from the point @xmath6 .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the motion of the given system has been presumed to be a cumulative effect of the physical regularities and the operator actions .",
    "the notion of partial equilibrium implements this feature .",
    "namely , the operator is considered to be able to halt the system motion at a certain multitude of points @xmath8 in the phase space @xmath1 to be called the locus of partial equilibrium and treated here as some smooth curve .",
    "so in the case of perfect rationality a gradual system motion towards the equilibrium point @xmath9 is due to the intelligent actions of the operator which can locate this point on the plane @xmath1 precisely .",
    "the coordinate frame under consideration has been chosen in such a manner that the @xmath10-axis be tangent to the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 at the point @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ f1]a ) .",
    "let us touch on the dynamics of a car following a lead car moving ahead with a fixed velocity @xmath11 to exemplify these constructions .",
    "the motion of the following car is usually described in terms of the headway distance @xmath12 and its velocity @xmath13 whose time variations are governed by the social force model generally written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a certain function . to the headway distance @xmath16 and the car velocity @xmath17 taken at the previous moment of time with some time shift @xmath18 ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) . ] in specifying the function @xmath15 a driver is typically assumed to respond to the combined effect of two stimuli .",
    "one of them is to keep the speed of his car equal , on the average , to the lead car speed @xmath11 and can be quantified in terms of the relative velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the other is to maintain an optimal headway distance @xmath20 generally determined by the values of @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "this stimulus similarly can be quantified by the difference @xmath21 .",
    "so @xmath22 is the equilibrium point of the car following in the phase space @xmath23 and the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 is the line @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , by simple kinematic reasons any point on this line corresponds to a steady state arrangement of the two cars which can be frozen by the driver just fixing the car velocity , whereas keeping the headway distance equal to its optimal value @xmath25 is due to the driver intelligent action .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the social force model   matches actually the perfect rationality in driver behavior .",
    "in fact , the _ detailed _ description of driver actions requires a certain extension of the phase space including , at least , the car acceleration @xmath26 as an individual phase variable .",
    "the matter is that , on one hand , by physical reasons the driver can not change freely the position @xmath10 and velocity @xmath13 of his car , he is able to affect the car dynamics via changing the acceleration @xmath26 only . on the other hand",
    ", the acceleration on its own contributes to the driver perception of the car motion quality .",
    "so in the approximation of perfect rationality the description of the car following is reduced to the problem of minimizing a certain cost functional whose integrand , a cost function , depends on the headway distance @xmath12 , the velocity @xmath13 , and also the acceleration @xmath26 @xcite . as a result",
    "the governing equation contains @xmath27 in the leading order and , thus , does not meet the newtonian mechanics paradigm .",
    "however , since the rational driver can perfectly predict the car motion , the final governing equation is reduced to the social force model  , where the `` force '' @xmath15 depends not only on the current values of the headway distance @xmath12 and the car velocity @xmath13 but also on the parameters of the equilibrium point @xmath28 the attaining of which is the goal of the driver actions . naturally , beyond the perfect rationality approximation",
    "the car dynamics can not be describe in the frameworks of newtonian mechanics @xcite .",
    "the perfect rationality can not be implemented in the reality because of the limit capacity of human cognition .",
    "as far as the system at hand is concerned , this limitation manifests itself in the fact that the operator is not able to order states of the system motion by their preference when they are close to one another in quality . in this case",
    "the rational behavior becomes physically impossible for the operator and model   can not pretend to describe the system dynamics . to tackle this problem",
    "let us note the following before modifying the governing equations  .",
    "pursuing two individual succeeding goals can be singled out in the operator actions .",
    "the first one is to halt the system motion by driving it to any point @xmath29 of the partial equilibrium locus because it could be tough governing fast motion of the system affected not only by the operator intentions but also the physical regularities .",
    "the second one is to drive the system towards the equilibrium position @xmath6 , for example , within close proximity to @xmath8 . as a result",
    "the mechanisms governing the system motion along the @xmath10- and @xmath30-axes are different ; let us discuss them separately .    in the chosen coordinate frame",
    "the curve @xmath8 is tangent to the @xmath10-axis at the equilibrium point @xmath6 , thereby , to simplify the further constructions we may confine our consideration to its certain neighborhood and regard the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 as the @xmath10-axis . outside the partial equilibrium locus the system state varies in time under any action taken by the operator .",
    "however , if after driving the system to some point @xmath29 the operator fixes the variable @xmath30 , there will be no `` forces '' causing the system motion along @xmath8 ; any point of @xmath8 is steady state .",
    "it enables us to approximate the `` force '' @xmath4 by a linear function @xmath31 and regard the cofactor @xmath32 to be mainly determined by the system mechanics .",
    "in other words , the fact that the operator behavior is not perfect seems not to influence substantially the rate of system motion along the @xmath10-axis and , thus , there is no necessity to modify equation  .",
    "moreover , in the case under consideration the function @xmath32 can be regarded as some constant @xmath33 without loss of generality .",
    "the situation is just opposite with respect to the motion along the @xmath30-axis ; the operator actions are to affect it directly .",
    "the operator is able to take any reasonable course of actions in order to drive the system towards the partial equilibrium locus and after getting some point @xmath29 he can just freeze the system motion along the @xmath30-axis to halt the system motion as a whole .",
    "the point @xmath34 is not necessary to be the point @xmath35 that the operator intended to get initially because reaching any point at the partial equilibrium locus is acceptable to halt the system motion .",
    "the point @xmath36 in turn is not mandatory to coincide with the equilibrium one because of the limit capacity of operator cognition . at the next step of governing the system dynamics",
    "the operator has no necessity to be in `` hurry '' ; now it is possible for him to draw a decision on taking actions for reaching the currently desired point @xmath36 during a relatively long time interval . in pursuing the latter goal the operator can drive the system either in close vicinity to the partial equilibrium locus @xmath37 or deviating the system from @xmath37 considerably to enable fast motion .",
    "therefore , to go beyond the frameworks of the perfect rationality in constructing a model for the system motion the following should be taken into account .",
    "first , the characteristic time scale @xmath38 of system dynamics in close vicinity to the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 must exceed essentially the corresponding time scale far from it , i.e. , the inequality @xmath39 should hold .",
    "second , the cognition limitations make it impossible for the operator to locate precisely not only the equilibrium point @xmath6 at @xmath8 but also the position of the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 itself . in order to specify this uncertainty",
    "let us introduce the perception thresholds , @xmath40 , that characterize the dimensions of the neighborhood @xmath41 of the equilibrium point @xmath6 withing which this point as well as the corresponding fragment of @xmath8 can be located by the operator with high probability . since the control over the variable @xmath30 is of prime priority in governing the system dynamics",
    "the threshold @xmath42 can be treated as a small parameter .",
    "therefore the region @xmath41 is actually a some narrow neighborhood of the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 or , more rigorously , its certain fragment containing the equilibrium point .",
    "any point of @xmath41 is regarded by the operator as equilibrium with high probability .",
    "third , the point @xmath43 characterizing the course of actions chosen by the operator at a given moment of time is not fixed , it can migrate inside the region @xmath41 as time goes on .",
    "the movement of this point has to be rather irregular until it remains inside the domain @xmath44 .",
    "the three features enable us to claim that the standard concept of stability is inapplicable to the system motion near the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 . indeed ,",
    "although the system has not reached the desired equilibrium point @xmath6 the operator freezes its motion near some other point @xmath29 and then keeps the system near @xmath8 until he makes a decision about driving the system towards @xmath6 .",
    "so , before making this decision the system motion near @xmath8 looks like stable fluctuations near @xmath8 , after that it has to be classified as unstable .",
    "let us discuss a model based on that captures the key aspects of such operator behavior .",
    "the operator chooses a point @xmath36 on the @xmath10-axis to which he is going to drive the system .",
    "while his control over the system motion is active the system dynamics is governed by the equations    [ freq:1 ] @xmath45 with the cofactor @xmath46 equal to unity , @xmath47 . here",
    "the subscript @xmath30 is omitted at the `` force '' @xmath48 .",
    "the two equations actually describe the system dynamics outside the region @xmath41 .",
    "when , roughly speaking , the system enters the region @xmath41 the operator regarding its any point as an acceptable destination just freezes the system motion along the @xmath30-axis to such a degree that real variations in the variable @xmath30 become imperceptible to him and , thus , are not controllable .",
    "this action is described by the stepwise transition @xmath49 here @xmath50 is some small random value , @xmath51 , which , in addition , can change in time also in an uncontrollable way , @xmath52 is a certain function of two arguments such that @xmath53      p(z_x , z_y ) \\ll 1       & &   \\text{for $ |z_x| \\gtrsim 1 $ \\textit{or } $ |z_y| \\gtrsim 1$}\\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] when the system leaves the region @xmath41 under the actions of uncontrollable factors or the operator gets a decision to correct the system location along the @xmath10-axis he resumes governing the system dynamics , which is represented as the stepwise transition @xmath54\\,.\\ ] ] finally the given model should be completed by an equation describing the operator perception of the desired destination point inside @xmath41 . in the present paper",
    "we write it in a symbolic form @xmath55    where the presence of the time @xmath56 in the list of arguments allows for random factors in the dynamics of the variable @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted that the formulated model of the system dynamics enables us to specify some general features of the `` force '' @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , the existence of the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 has allowed us to single out two stimuli in governing the system motion which determine the operator actions .",
    "they may be reformulated as follows .",
    "the goal of the first one is to keep up the variable @xmath30 in close proximity to the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 in order to depress the fast system motion .",
    "this stimulus can be quantified in terms of the variable @xmath30 . as result ,",
    "the component @xmath57 of the `` force '' @xmath48 caused the first stimulus may be written as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is some kinetic coefficient .",
    "the second one is related to the operator actions of driving the system towards the desired point @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding component @xmath60 does not change its singe in crossing the @xmath10-axis and in the simplest case may be represented in the form @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is another kinetic coefficient .",
    "therefore the expression @xmath63 is the simplest ansatz catching the basic features of such systems .",
    "the form of the governing equations   within approximation   allows us call it the oscillator with dynamical traps .    following @xcite the time moments when the operator suspends or resumes the control over the system motion",
    "will be referred to as action points . besides",
    ", the neighborhood @xmath41 of the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 will be called the region of dynamical traps because after transition   the system can reside inside it for a long time .",
    "it should be pointed out that a similar notion of dynamical traps was also introduced for relaxation oscillations in systems with singular kinetic coefficients @xcite and congested traffic flow @xcite . besides , the concept of dynamical traps is met in describing hamiltonian systems with complex dynamics ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) that denote some regions in the corresponding phase space with anomalously long residence time , however , the nature of the latter traps is different .",
    "the stated concept of human behavior combing the principles of the perfect rationality and the limit capacity of human cognition in ordering possible actions , events , etc . by their preference and as a results , treating some of them as equivalent will be called the fuzzy rationality . in the case under consideration",
    "the fuzzy rationality reflects itself in two effects , the stagnation of the system motion in the region of dynamical traps and probabilistic nature of the system dynamics in this region .      in the present paper the main attention",
    "is focused on the complexity of system motion , e.g. , the corresponding phase portraits , that is caused by the dynamical traps on their own , i.e. , dynamical traps treated as sources of the motion stagnation . previously @xcite it was demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the motion stagnation in the trap region and additive noise can cause nonequilibrium phase transitions . moreover , for one oscillator with dynamical traps there exists lyapunov s function , so in this case the role of noise is constructive , i.e. , for the corresponding phase transition to arise the noise intensity should exceed some threshold @xcite .",
    "for an ensemble of several oscillators with dynamical traps we have failed to find the corresponding lyapunov s function and the preliminary results of numerical simulation @xcite enabled us to pose a hypothesis that the system stagnation in the region of dynamical traps on its own can induce nonequilibrium phase transitions and formation of complex spatial and temporal patterns .",
    "in other words , even without noise effects , in multi - element systems with dynamical traps there should be emergent phenomena of a new type caused by the mismatch between actions of different operators with fuzzy rationality .    , namely , halting the governing of the system motion in entering @xmath41 , then , random motion of the system in @xmath41 , and , finally , resuming the governing of motion due to the system leaving the region @xmath41 or the operator decision of driving the system towards the desired position @xmath36 .",
    "right fragment _ represents the corresponding effective continuous description of regular system motion in the region @xmath41 based on introduction of the stagnation factor @xmath64 being continuous function of its arguments meeting the inequality @xmath65 . ]    therefore , in what follows we will analyze a model that mimics the effects of dynamical traps in the frameworks of regular system motion with stagnation in the region @xmath41 . it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fcm ] , where the left fragment depicts the characteristic three events occurring when the system goes through the region of dynamical traps @xmath41 .",
    "namely , halting the system motion when entering @xmath41 , the motion in @xmath41 under influence of random factors , and , resuming the governing of motion .",
    "the latter can be caused by two factors , the system leaving the region @xmath41 or the operator just getting the decision of driving the system towards the desired point @xmath35 .",
    "both of them determine some cumulative mean lifetime @xmath39 of the system inside @xmath41 . the right fragment of fig .",
    "[ fcm ] exhibits an effective model mimicking this behavior , at least , semiquantitatively .",
    "it assumes the system motion along the @xmath30-axis to be governed by the regular force @xmath66 , where the continuous function @xmath64 , the stagnation factor , takes a small value @xmath67 at the central points of the region @xmath41 , in other words , @xmath68 .",
    "as the point @xmath0 goes away from the central points of @xmath41 and leaves it the stagnation factor exhibits gradual growth up to unity , i.e. , @xmath69 for @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "let us make use of the following ansatz @xmath72 in addition , in the frameworks of the given model irregular variations of the final destination point @xmath36 in the `` mind '' of the operator should be also ignored . within this approximation model",
    "reads    [ freq:2 ] @xmath73    the following constructions for multi - element systems will use these governing equations   as the starting point .",
    "keeping in mind the aforesaid let us consider a chain of @xmath74 `` lazy '' beads ( fig .  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "each of these beads can move in the vertical direction and its dynamics is described in terms of the deviation @xmath75 from the equilibrium position and the motion velocity @xmath76 depending on time @xmath56 , here the bead index @xmath77 runs from @xmath78 to @xmath74 .",
    "the equilibrium position @xmath79 is specified assuming the formal initial ( @xmath80 ) and terminal ( @xmath81 ) beads to be fixed .",
    "each bead @xmath77 `` wishes '' to get the `` optimal '' middle position with respect to its nearest neighbors .",
    "so one of the stimuli for it to accelerate or decelerate is the difference @xmath82 provided its relative velocity @xmath83 with respect to the pair of the nearest beads is sufficiently low .",
    "otherwise , especially if bead @xmath77 is currently located near the optimal position , it has to eliminate the relative velocity @xmath84 , representing the other stimulus for bead @xmath77 to change its state of motion . the model to be formulated below combines both of these stimuli within one cumulative impetus @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the relative weight of the second stimulus",
    "actually this ansatz coincides with approximation   provided the system variables are measured in units where the kinetic coefficient @xmath87 .",
    "beads under consideration and the structure of their individual phase space @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the formal initial @xmath80 and terminal @xmath81 beads are assumed to be fixed , specifying the equilibrium bead position.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    when , however , the relative velocity @xmath84 becomes less then a threshold @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath91 bead @xmath77 is not able to recognize its motion with respect to its nearest neighbors .",
    "since a bead can not `` predict '' the dynamics of its neighbors , it has to regard them as moving uniformly with the current velocities .",
    "so from its point of view , under such conditions the current situation can not become worse , at least , rather fast . in this case bead",
    "@xmath77 just `` allows '' itself to do nothing , i.e. , not to change the state of motion and to retard the correction of its relative position .",
    "this feature is the reason why such beads are called `` lazy '' . below we will use the dimensionless units in which the perception threshold is equal to unity @xmath92 as well as in the later expression for cumulative impetus the required proportionality factor is equal to unity too .    under these conditions",
    "the equation governing the system dynamics is written in the following form @xmath93\\,.\\ ] ] if the cofactor @xmath94 was equal to unity the given system would be no more then a chain of beads connected by elastic springs characterized by the friction coefficient @xmath86 .",
    "the term @xmath95 with the coefficient @xmath96 that can be treated as a certain viscous friction of the bead motion with respect to the given physical frame has been introduced to prevent the system motion as a whole reaching extremely high velocities .",
    "the factor @xmath94 is due to the effect of dynamical traps and following the general ansatz   we write @xmath97 where , as before , the parameter @xmath98 $ ] quantifies the intensity of dynamical traps .",
    "if the parameter @xmath99 , the dynamical traps do not exist at all , in the opposite case , @xmath100 , their influence is pronounced inside the neighborhood @xmath101 of the axis @xmath102 ( the trap region ) whose thickness is about unity ( fig .",
    "for the terminal fixed beads , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , we set @xmath105 which play the role of `` boundary '' conditions for equation  .",
    "it should be noted that the emergence phenomena in a similar chain of oscillators with dynamical traps and affected by some additive noise were considered for the first time in papers  @xcite .",
    "the system of equations   was solved numerically using the standard explicit runge - kutta algorithm of fourth order with fixed time step .",
    "initially all the beads were located at the equilibrium positions @xmath106 and perturbations were introduced into the system via ascribing random independent values to their velocities . the time step @xmath107 of numerical integration",
    "was chosen in such a way that its decrease or increase by several times have no considerable effects .",
    "the system dynamics was found to depend remarkably on the intensity of `` dissipation '' quantified by the parameter @xmath86 .",
    "we remind that the parameter @xmath86 specifies the relative weight of the stimuli to take the middle `` optimal '' position and to eliminate the relative velocity ; the larger the parameter @xmath86 , the more significant the latter stimulus .",
    "so let us discuss the obtained results for the cases of `` strong '' , `` intermediate '' , and `` weak '' dissipation individually .",
    "it should be noted beforehand that , first , all the results of numerical simulation to be presented below were obtained for the dynamical traps of high intensity , namely , for @xmath108 .",
    "emergent phenomena in such systems for different values of the dynamical trap intensity as well as the influence of stochastic factors are worthy of individual analysis .",
    "second , the parameter @xmath109 quantifying additional friction introduced to depress extremely high values of the bead velocities @xmath110 was set equal to @xmath111 .",
    "third , in plotting a collection of phase portraits of bead motion , e.g. , @xmath112 , the bead coordinates @xmath113 are shown with some individual shifts , namely , @xmath114 to simplify the portrait visualization .",
    "the system dynamics with `` strong '' dissipation is exemplified by numerical data obtained using the kinetic coefficient @xmath115 . in this case",
    "the system instability was detected numerically only for the chains with the number of beads @xmath116 .",
    "figure  [ f3]_a _ depicts the found limit cycles of the bead oscillations for the chain with @xmath117 .",
    "the corresponding time patterns @xmath118 , @xmath119 of the middle bead @xmath120 showing time variations of its position and relative velocity are exhibited in fig .  [ f3]_b_. as seen , the periodic motion of these beads looks like relaxation oscillations with the `` slow '' motion fragments matching @xmath121 , i.e. , the synchronized motion of neighboring beads .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the given bead periodic motion is not the standard relaxation oscillations related to alternative step - wise transitions between two quasistable states directly specified by system properties . in fact , for the given system only the states @xmath122 are singled out in properties and the time patten @xmath119 exhibits considerable spike - wise variations only withing the `` fast '' motion fragments , whereas at the other moments of time it is located near the point @xmath123 .",
    "in addition , it should be pointed out that the state @xmath124 is metastable , i.e. stable with respect to small perturbations . moreover , not all large perturbations in the bead velocities were found numerically to give rise to the limit cycle formation ; some of them faded away . however , when the instability was initiated , the steady state oscillations appeared usually after the time interval @xmath125 exceeding the period of these oscillations ten - fold .     for the chain of three beads with `` strong '' dissipation ( _ a _ ) and the corresponding time patterns of the middle bead motion ( _ b _ ) , namely , the time variations in the bead position ( 1 ) and the relative velocity ( 2 ) . in numerical simulation",

    "the frames ( _ a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) depict the data for @xmath127 . the frame ( _ c _ ) exhibits the phase portraits of equidistant 10 beads for the chain of 50 beads and a fragment of the corresponding phase trajectory of a middle bead is shown in the frame ( _ d _ ) .",
    "the frames ( _ e _ ) and ( _ f _ ) demonstrate actually the same data for the chain of 100 beads . in simulation the integration time step @xmath128 was used .",
    "the frames ( _ d , f _ ) exhibit trajectories of duration @xmath129 . ]    for the given bead chains evolution of the phase portraits as the number of beads @xmath74 increases is illustrated in fig .",
    "while their size is not too large , namely , @xmath130 , the regular periodic motion of the beads remains stable , however , various pattens of limit cycles can be formed depending on the initial perturbations .",
    "two found examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ f4]_a , b_. as seen in fig .",
    "[ f4]_b _ a limit cycle can have its own complex structure , which does be a property of the system dynamics rather than a numerical artifact ; it was verified by decreasing the integration time step by several times .",
    "as the number of beads increases the system dynamics becomes irregular ( fig .",
    "[ f4]_c , e _ ) , at least , on time scales about @xmath131 no periodic bead motion was found for @xmath132 .",

    "as seen , this phase portrait does have a complex multi - scale structure .",
    "a new mechanism of emergent phenomena in social systems governed by cumulative action of human beings and physical regularities has been discussed .",
    "it is the fuzzy rationality caused by the bounded capacity of human cognition and manifesting itself in the limited capability of human beings in ordering events , actions , strategies of behavior , etc . according to their preference perfectly",
    "this is most pronounced when , for example , an individual should make a choice between several possible actions similar in quality . as a result",
    ", he has to consider them equivalent , thereby , their choice becomes random and practically independent of the real action quality `` hidden '' for the individual . only in the case where two actions at hand are characterized by a significant difference in quality",
    "the choice is determined by the preference relation . when the control over the system dynamics is concerned the fuzzy rationality",
    "affects the choice between the `` hidden '' optimal strategy of behavior and actions in its proximity . in this case",
    "the optimal strategy becomes unattainable and individuals consider a whole multitude of possible actions `` optimal '' with high probability . as a result",
    ", the dynamics of a given system as well as the control by its elements ( individuals ) is stagnated until the system motion goes rather far from the optimal one , which was expected to induce a system instability .    to elucidate this concept , first",
    ", it has been applied to constructing governing equations for a certain system whose dynamics can be represented as motion of a point @xmath0 on the phase plane @xmath1 . the system is considered to be governed by some physical regularities and the active behavior of its operator ( individual ) together , with the contributions of the two factors being of the same significance .",
    "this feature is taken into account presuming the existence of a partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 in the phase space @xmath1 , i.e. , an one - dimensional set of points such that the system can reside at any one of them infinitely long while the operator suspends its active control over the system dynamics .",
    "in other words , the operator can halt the system motion at any point of @xmath8 because when the system gets the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 there no mechanisms of `` physical '' nature causing its migration along @xmath8 ; only the motivated behavior of the operator can do this .",
    "outside @xmath8 the system can not be halted by any action of the operator ; the system is forced to move ( on the phase plane @xmath1 ) just by the physical regularities .",
    "this construction is exemplified in short appealing to the mathematical models for car following .",
    "pursuing two individual goals are singled out in the operator actions .",
    "the first one is to halt the fast motion by driving the system to any point of the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 .",
    "the second one is driving the system towards the desired equilibrium point , for example , in the vicinity of @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that if the operator behavior were rational strictly , then the motion of the given system would be characterized by some stable stationary point .",
    "it should be pointed out that under such conditions self - organized phenomena can not arise . for the model at hand",
    "the implementation of the fuzzy rationality discussed above has been described within the notion of dynamical traps .",
    "namely , the operator is assumed to consider all the points inside a certain neighborhood @xmath41 of @xmath8 acceptable to be regarded as equilibrium .",
    "therefor , after the system goes into @xmath41 called the region of dynamical trap , the operator halts the system motion or his reaction time becomes much longer then the reaction time corresponding to the system motion outside @xmath41 .",
    "so , roughly speaking , the fuzzy rationality gives rise to the system stagnation inside the region of dynamical traps rather then induces some instability of the equilibrium point .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a simple model of oscillator with dynamical traps catches the general properties of such objects .",
    "suspension and resumption of the operator active behavior in governing the system dynamics is a probabilistic process . the present paper , however , analyzes the dynamical trap effect on its own with respect whether it can induce instability and emergent phenomena of a new type in multi - element ensembles .",
    "so a continuous deterministic model for the dynamical trap effect was developed . in the frameworks of this model the dynamical trap region",
    "is related to anomalous behavior of the corresponding kinetic coefficients inducing the system stagnation in @xmath41 .",
    "so it was possible to expect that in multi - element ensembles the mismatch between actions of different operators should regularly force the system to go away from the region @xmath41 contained the stationary point , causing an instability of a new type which can not be met in `` physical '' media .",
    "indeed , this instability , broadly speaking , is due to the partial equilibrium locus @xmath8 being an one - dimensional collection of saddle points rather then stems from some effect making the stationary point unstable .    to be specific the self - organization of spatio - temporal patterns in the chain of oscillators with dynamical traps , the `` lazy '' bead model ,",
    "was studied in detail .",
    "this model assumes the individual bead behavior to be governed by two stimuli , one of them is to optimize the spatial arrangement of a given bead with respect to its nearest neighbors , the other is to minimize their relative velocities .",
    "however , when the relative velocity becomes rather small a bead being `` lazy '' loses motives for active behavior in correcting the current situation because in this case it can not become worth .",
    "this suspension of activity is regarded as the effect of dynamical traps .    in the frameworks of the `` lazy '' bead model",
    "it has been found , in particular , that , first , the dynamical trap effect on its own , i.e. , without noise can induce the system instability when the number of beads exceeds some critical value about unity .",
    "it should be noted once more that in the case of one oscillator with dynamical traps for the instability to arise noise must be present and its amplitude has to exceed some threshold .",
    "second , the complexity of the system dynamics becomes more and more pronounced as the relative weight @xmath86 of the latter stimulus decreases gradually . for not too small values of @xmath86",
    "the developed spatio - temporal patterns of the bead motion match periodic motion and in the phase space @xmath1 they are represented by a collection of limit cycles which , however , can be of a complex form .",
    "nevertheless , when the number of beads becomes large enough , @xmath163 , the periodic bead motion was not found numerically , maybe , because the waiting time necessary for these patterns to form becomes too long for these many - element ensembles .",
    "it enables us to pose a question as to whether noise with an extremely small amplitude can affect substantially the properties exhibited by systems of many elements with fuzzy rational behavior .",
    "third , in the case of small values of the parameter @xmath86 it has been demonstrated that even for the ensembles of a few beads the dynamical traps give rise to really irregular system motion and phase portraits with stable multi - scale geometry .",
