    "in the mid to late 1990s , it was shown @xcite that the mass modification of the particles in the hot and dense hadronic sources can lead to a squeezed back - to - back correlation ( bbc ) of boson - antiboson pairs in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "this bbc is the result of a quantum mechanical transformation relating in - medium quasiparticles to the two - mode squeezed states of their free observable counterparts , through a bogoliubov transformation between the creation ( annihilation ) operators of the quasiparticles and the free observable particles @xcite .",

    "@xcite , we calculated the bbc functions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 using a monte carlo method and investigated the relativistic effect on the bbc functions .",
