    "perhaps the most important remaining open - question for the quantum - field - theory - based description of interactions of the basic building blocks of matter is the mechanism which drives the high - energy interactions of longitudinally and transversely polarized , massive electroweak bosons . the higgs model and its known extensions provide a set of possible scenarios for such a mechanism .",
    "these scenarios are very attractive because they provide an abundant supply of road - maps and the corresponding navigation rules which could be simply picked - up and followed while exploring , at the lhc collider , the _",
    "`` terra incognita '' _ of the tev - energy - scale interactions of electroweak bosons . by applying these rules the exploration process",
    "is reduced to the painstaking scenario - scrutinizing process .",
    "such a strategy has two important merits : it is theoretically well - controlled and experimentally well - defined .",
    "but is has also a price to pay : it involves a considerable risk of overlooking new , unexpected phenomena .    to minimize such a risk",
    ", we would like to advocate a complementary strategy focusing on the development of handy experimental tools for the exploration process in parallel to mastering the discovery - guide recipes .",
    "obviously , the most desirable tool for exploring the high - energy interactions of the electroweak bosons would be a luminous , polarized , high - energy beam of electroweak bosons .",
    "if proton beams of energies exceeding @xmath4 gev were available , secondary beams of electroweak bosons could be easily formed and used in dedicated experiments  in close analogy to fixed target muon - beam experiments which routinely use beams of unstable particles .",
    "the central point of the present and of the forthcoming paper @xcite is that , even if experiments using beams of electroweak bosons can not be realized at the macroscopic length - scales , the lhc collider offers a reduced - scope , yet unique opportunity to realize them at the femtoscopic length - scale .",
    "the luminous , high - energy lhc collider will be a very efficient factory to copiously produce the electroweak bosons .",
    "its unique merit , with respect to other machines , is that these short - living particles could be observed at the lhc collider over sufficiently long time for experimental `` femtoscopic '' studies of their properties and interactions .",
    "the electroweak bosons will travel , for the observers co - moving with the lhc bunches , over the atomic distances of up to @xmath5 fm before decaying .",
    "this defines the maximal lengths , thus the type , of possible targets which , if arranged to co - move with the lhc bunches , could be employed in experimental studies of properties and collisions of the electroweak bosons .",
    "nature provides only one type of target satisfying the above criteria  the atomic nucleus .",
    "nuclear beams will play a double role in the proposed scheme .",
    "first of all , they will provide standardized bunches of quarks and gluons of the adjustable isospin , allowing to tune the fluxes of the electroweak bosons .",
    "in addition , they will supply the co - moving , hadronic matter of adjustable length , which will serve in forming the effective targets for the beam of electroweak bosons .",
    "the terms _ beam of electroweak bosons _ and _ effective target _ are precisely defined in sections 3 and 4 of this paper .",
    "they will be used here in direct analogy to the beam and targets being used in the muon scattering experiments .",
    "the creation of the beam of electroweak bosons in collisions of fixed - isospin partonic - bunches is considered here to be equivalent to the processes of creation of the muon beam from the fixed - flux and flavour - composition beams of secondary hadrons .",
    "hard partonic collisions creating the electroweak boson beam are uncorrelated with the subsequent collisions of the produced @xmath6-boson beam particles with bunches of spectator quarks and gluons because of the large lorentz-@xmath7 factor of the colliding partonic bunches , high mass of electroweak bosons , and their colourless nature .",
    "this factorization is analogous to the factorization of the production and collisions of the muon beam .",
    "the length of the target for the electroweak boson beam , contrary to the fixed - length target for the muon beam , will vary on event - by - event basis depending upon the localization of the space - time volume , within the bunch of quarks and gluons , where the beam particle was created .",
    "the average length of the target , however , will be fixed for the fixed atomic number of the primary beam particles .",
    "this quantity defines the _ effective - target _ length .",
    "the most important difference between using the muon beam in a concrete experiment and using the electroweak boson beam is that the former one can be isolated by the suitable absorber and the beam transport system while the latter one can not be fully isolated from the beams of spectator quarks and gluons , and from the produced hadrons .",
    "therefore , special measurement procedures and unfolding methods must be invented to filter out , as much as possible , the electroweak boson collision signals from the noise of ordinary collisions of quarks and gluons .    the discussion of such procedures and methods will be presented in a dedicated paper and is not discussed here .",
    "this paper is devoted to the beam aspects of the femtoscopic experiment .",
    "we shall pick - up the the beam of charged electroweak bosons , namely @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and present its properties , methods of controlling its intensity , momentum - band , polarization and the luminosity of the @xmath6nucleon collisions .",
    "if planck - energy - scale antineutrino beams were available , then configuring a fixed target experiment to study the properties and the collisions of polarized @xmath6-bosons could follow directly the examples of the cern fixed target experiments which use the polarized muon beams .",
    "polarized @xmath6-bosons produced in collisions of the antineutrinos with a polarized low - energy electron beam would travel the distance larger than @xmath10 kilometer before decaying .",
    "thus , there would be a sufficient space for : ( 1 ) filtering out the annihilation processes , ( 2 ) selecting a narrow momentum band of the produced @xmath6-beam , ( 3 ) measuring the @xmath6-boson macroscopic electric current , ( 4 ) placing a suitable collision target , ( 5 ) identifying and measuring the products of the @xmath6-boson collisions .",
    "for example , the inclusive cross section , @xmath11 , for scattering of polarized @xmath6-bosons on nucleons could be derived from the measurements by using the canonical formula : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the observed rate of events at the @xmath6nucleon centre - of - mass - system ( cms ) energy squared @xmath14 , in which the momentum of the outgoing @xmath6-boson is @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the flux of @xmath6-bosons having the polarization @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the target density , and @xmath19 is the target length .    applying this formula to the planck - energy experimental configuration requires two conditions , always taken for granted in the fixed target muon experiments , to be fulfilled :    * the @xmath6-boson beam must be formed before arriving at the position of the target . * the total distance between the beam creation zone and the exit point of the target must be significantly smaller than @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the @xmath6-boson beam lorentz factor , @xmath22 is the lifetime of the @xmath6-boson in its rest frame and @xmath23 is the speed of light in the vacuum .    in our `",
    "gedanken experiment ' they are fulfilled owing to the selection of the point - like annihilation process as the source of the @xmath6-boson beam and owing to the planck - scale @xmath21 factor which , in the rest frame of the target , assures macroscopic distances over which the @xmath6-boson could travel before its disintegration .",
    "such an experiment can not be presently realized .",
    "however , as we shall show in the following section , a reduced scope of its functions can be realized at the femtoscopic scale using the lhc beams .",
    "the lhc beams , that will be employed in configuring such an experiment are the proton and the deuteron beams colliding with the heavy ion beams .",
    "the collisions of these beams will be referred to , in the following , as the nucleon ",
    "nucleus collisions .",
    "given the ratio of the lhc beam energy to the planck - scale energy , the lhc experiment to study the @xmath6-boson properties and its collisions must be configured at the fermi - length scale .",
    "it is thus bound to use the nuclear medium to form the beam of @xmath6-bosons and to observe their interactions .",
    "the nucleus will be considered , in the processes discussed in this paper , as a classical object described fully by its static parameters .",
    "its dynamic quantum degrees of freedom can be safely neglected in the following discussion .    the nucleus - rest - frame space - time picture of production of a @xmath6-boson in nucleon - nucleus collisions , its passage in the hadronic matter and subsequent decay is shown in fig .  [ fig : factorization ] . in the nucleus rest frame ,",
    "the incoming nucleon can be considered , for the lorentz factor @xmath24 , as a lorentz - frozen ( static ) bunch of independent partons ( quarks and gluons ) .",
    "the @xmath6-boson is produced in the hard collision of one its partons with the target nucleus .",
    "the produced @xmath6-boson travels the distance @xmath25 in the nucleus , then leaves the nucleus , and decays at the distance @xmath26 .",
    "three requirements must be satisfied to `` configure '' the nucleon  nucleus collisions at the lhc as a femtoscopic experiment to explore the high - energy interactions of the @xmath6-bosons with hadronic matter .",
    "the necessity to fulfill these requirements determines which of the functions of the ` gedanken experiment ' can be realized at the lhc .",
    "they are discussed below in turn .",
    "the first requirement is to define the experimental signatures , and to provide the effective selection methods for those of the nucleon ",
    "nucleus collisions which contain the signals of the @xmath6-collisions with hadronic matter .",
    "contrary to the ` gedanken experiment ' the @xmath6-boson collision events can not be directly selected . as a consequence",
    "the scope of exploring the @xmath6-collision processes must be limited to the inclusive @xmath6nucleon collisions , @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath6-boson collision effects , and the effects of the absorption of the @xmath6-bosons in hadronic matter will be studied using the sample of events characterized by the final - state @xmath6-boson signatures .",
    "these effects will have to be filtered out from the effects due to the initial state interaction of the partons producing the @xmath6-bosons , and from the overwhelming `` noise '' of simultaneous collisions of co - moving beams of strongly interacting partons .",
    "the filtering methods will be proposed and their sensitivity to the @xmath6-collision effects will be discussed in @xcite .        the second requirement is to provide a framework , similar to that for the ` gedanken experiment ' , which will allow to express the nucleon ",
    "nucleus collision observables exclusively in terms of the @xmath6nucleon inclusive cross section and experimentally controllable quantities . for simplicity",
    "we consider first the framework for the inclusive scattering of unpolarized @xmath6-bosons , @xmath27 .",
    "this framework will be extended in section  [ subsec : frampolar ] by including the polarization effects , and in section  [ subsec : unfolding ] by including the @xmath6-boson absorption effects .",

    "we have kept explicitly their dependence upon the momentum of the nucleus , allowing for the apparent deformations of its volume and density in reference frames where the nucleus moves with high velocity ( e.g.  in the @xmath6-boson rest frame ) .",
    "the discussion of the control of the @xmath6-boson targets , presented in this section , uses explicitly the fact that the product of these two functions is invariant with respect to lorentz transformations .",

    "this allows us to discuss the effective target length in the most convenient reference frame and use the formulas derived in this frame in arbitrary lorenz reference frame , provided that it will appear in the expressions together with the nuclear density .",
    "the most convenient reference frame is the rest frame of the nucleus with the @xmath50-direction collinear with the direction of the incoming nucleon .",
    "the @xmath6-boson path - length in hadronic matter is determined by the relative position of the @xmath6-boson creation cell with respect to the centre of the nucleus and by the @xmath6-boson momentum .",
    "the target length for the @xmath6-boson beam will thus vary on event - by - event basis .",
    "the event - by - event variation of the target length can not be controlled experimentally at the lhc .",

    "the transverse size of the @xmath6-boson formation cell ( i.e. the region where , for given @xmath228 and @xmath229 , the @xmath6-formation process is confined ) is determined by the overlap of the localization volumes of the quark ( antiquark ) of the nucleon and antiquark ( quark ) the of the nucleus . the transverse position of the @xmath6-production cell",
    "is thus restricted to the region specified by the following boundaries : @xmath230 , and @xmath231 .",
    "these conditions define the impact parameter and the @xmath6-boson momentum - dependent region in which the integration over @xmath232 will have to be performed . since the transverse - size boundary is confined to small distances ( with respect to the nucleus size and the @xmath6-boson path - length )",
    ", the integrals over @xmath232 can be calculated explicitly : @xmath233    secondly , we note that the transverse momentum of the @xmath6-bosons is , for the lhc energies , significantly smaller than its nucleus - rest - frame longitudinal momentum .",
    "this allows us to ignore , in the calculation of the average path - length , the contribution coming from non - collinear @xmath6nucleus collisions .",
    "technically , this simplification assures the cylindrical symmetry of the integral , allowing to factorize the transverse and the longitudinal degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition , it allows us to drop the dependence upon the incoming @xmath6-boson momentum @xmath234 in the path - length term and upon the transverse momentum of the @xmath6-boson in the probability term .",
