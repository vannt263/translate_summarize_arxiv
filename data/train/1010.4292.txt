    "<S> the calculated @xmath7 is analyzed with the use of the @xmath9 and @xmath10-@xmath9 distributions : the latter is derived with the superstatistical approach ( ssa ) and microcanonical approach ( mca ) to the nonextensive statistics , where @xmath10 stands for the entropic index . based on analyses of our simulation results </S>",
    "<S> , a critical comparison is made between the ssa and mca . </S>",
    "<S> simulations have been performed also for the @xmath0-body ideal - gas system . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the coupling between oscillators in the bath has been examined by additional ( @xmath11 ) models which include baths consisting of coupled linear chains with periodic and fixed - end boundary conditions . </S>"
