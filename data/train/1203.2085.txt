    "recently the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations reported event excesses , which may imply the higgs boson with mass of about @xmath0gev .",
    "while it is difficult to explain the higgs mass in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) as long as the sparticle masses are around 1tev  @xcite , such a higgs mass can be explained if the sparticles are heavier than multi - tev  @xcite .",
    "one of such scenarios is the anomaly - mediated susy breaking ( amsb ) model  @xcite , where the sfermions and the gravitino are @xmath1@xmath2tev and the gaugino masses are @xmath1@xmath2gev , given by the amsb relation .",
    "phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and it was shown that it is compatible with thermal leptogenesis  @xcite , which requires the reheating temperature as high as @xmath3gev  @xcite . is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inflaton decay rate .",
    "note that this definition of @xmath6 is smaller than that of ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor @xmath7 . ]",
    "another attractive scenario is that all sparticles are @xmath8tev in the gravity - mediated susy breaking .",
    "the scenario alleviates the susy flavor / cp problems because of the heavy susy particles , while it explains the 125gev higgs boson for @xmath9  @xcite and the present dark matter abundance ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for realization in the focus - point region  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the scenario suffers from the cosmological polonyi problem  @xcite , since there must be a singlet susy breaking field , called the polonyi field , in order to generate sizable gaugino masses .",
    "although the polonyi may decay before the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) begins for the polonyi mass @xmath10tev , it releases a huge amount of entropy because it dominates the universe before the decay .",
    "thus the leptogenesis scenario does not work in this setup .",
    "an interesting solution to the polonyi problem was proposed long ago by linde  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that , if the polonyi field has a large hubble - induced mass , it follows a time - dependent potential minimum adiabatically and the resultant amplitude of coherent oscillations is exponentially suppressed .",
    "recently , two of the present authors ( ft and tty ) noticed that there is an upper bound on the reheating temperature for the adiabatic solution to work  @xcite and also showed that such a large hubble mass may be a consequence of the strong dynamics at the planck scale  @xcite or the fundamental cut - off scale one order of magnitude lower than the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "more important , the present authors found that there are generally additional contributions to the polonyi abundance which depends on the inflation energy scale , and we showed that the polonyi problem is still solved or greatly relaxed in high - scale inflation models  @xcite . in this solution , we do not need any additional mechanism to dilute the polonyi abundance .",
    "therefore , it may revive the conventional polonyi model as a realistic susy breaking model , which is fully compatible with the current experiments and observations , including the 125gev higgs boson .",
    "in this letter we study the adiabatic solution in detail , considering various production processes of the polonyi field as well as the thermal and non - thermal gravitino production .",
    "in particular , we focus on a minimal model in which only a certain coupling of the inflaton to the polonyi field is enhanced .",
    "we also consider explicit inflation models to see if there is an allowed parameter space where the polonyi and gravitino problems are solved .",
    "first we briefly review the cosmological polonyi problem in the gravity mediation .",
    "let us denote the polonyi field by @xmath11 , which makes a dominant contribution to the susy breaking .",
    "its @xmath12-term is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gravitino mass and @xmath15 is the reduced planck scale .",
    "it generally couples to the mssm superfields as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 collectively denote the matter and gauge superfields , respectively , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constants of order unity . here and hereafter ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are taken to be real and positive , for simplicity .",
    "these couplings give masses of order @xmath14 to the susy particles , as @xmath21 note that @xmath11 must be a singlet field in order to give a sizable mass to the gauginos . the following term in the khler potential yields the sizable @xmath22 and @xmath23 terms  @xcite , @xmath24 as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus the framework naturally solves the @xmath27 problem .",
    "if one takes the gravitino mass to be as large as 10tev , the susy flavor and cp problems are greatly relaxed and the cosmological gravitino problem is also ameliorated .",
    "it also explains the 125gev higgs boson without tuning the @xmath28-parameter  @xcite .",
    "therefore the @xmath8tev susy is plausible from these phenomenological point of view .",
    "however , the model suffers from the cosmological polonyi problem , which inevitably arises in the gravity - mediation scenario .",
    "the polonyi abundance is estimated as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the initial amplitude , which is in general of the order of @xmath15 . the reheating temperature @xmath6 is defined by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the inflaton decay rate , and @xmath33 counts the relativistic degrees of freedom at the reheating .",
    "here we have assumed that the potential for @xmath11 can be well approximated by a quadratic term for @xmath34 , and that the @xmath11 starts to oscillate before the reheating .",
    "the polonyi abundance ( [ rhoz ] ) is so large that the @xmath11 dominates the energy density of the universe soon after the reheating , and causes cosmological problems .",
    "the polonyi decays into gauge bosons through the interaction ( [ kw ] ) with the decay rate given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the polonyi mass at the zero temperature .",
    "the decay into gauginos is suppressed by @xmath37 or @xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes the gaugino mass , and as we will see later , the polonyi mass is considered to be slightly enhanced compared to @xmath39 or @xmath14 .",
    "we parametrize it as @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the interaction ( [ mu ] ) induces the decay of the polonyi into the higgs boson pair  @xcite , @xmath42 while the decay into a higgsino pair is suppressed by a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "the polonyi also decays into a pair of gravitinos if kinematically allowed  @xcite .",
    "the decay rate is given by @xmath43 for example , if the decay into gauge bosons is the dominant decay mode , the lifetime of the polonyi is given by @xmath44 if the decay into the gravitino pair is dominant , the lifetime is given by @xmath45 the lifetime must be ( much ) shorter than 1sec in order not to spoil the success of bbn  @xcite .",
    "even if it decays before bbn , it dilutes the pre - existing baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the dilution factor is roughly given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the polonyi decay temperature .",
    "the dilution factor is so large that thermal and non - thermal leptogenesis scenarios do not work . therefore some involved mechanisms to create the baryon asymmetry",
    "is required if the polonyi problem is solved by increasing the polonyi mass . in the next section",
    "we will consider another attractive solution to the polonyi problem in which there is no late - time entropy production .     and",

    ", we can see that the polonyi abundance is suppressed for @xmath72 and large inflation scale .",
    "hereafter we take @xmath73 for simplicity .",
    "now let us see how the present model is constrained from cosmological arguments .",
    "first , gravitinos are effectively produced at the reheating , and its abundance is proportional to the reheating temperature . if the gravitino is heavier than the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , it is unstable and decays emitting energetic particles .",
    "such late gravitino decay changes the helium-4 abundance  @xcite , and produces lsps non - thermally .",
    "the polonyi causes similar effects : the polonyi decay may alter the standard bbn results and yield too many lsps .",
    "if the polonyi decays into the gravitino , the subsequent gravitino decay also causes similar effects .",
    "notice that the polonyi abundance is given by the sum of the coherent oscillation ( [ co ] ) and thermal production , the latter of which is comparable to the abundance of the ( transverse components of ) gravitino if @xmath74 .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows constraints on the @xmath67 and @xmath6 plane from thermally produced gravitinos and the polonyi coherent oscillations and thermal production for @xmath4810tev and @xmath50 ( upper panel ) and @xmath49tev and @xmath75 ( lower panel ) .",
    "the choice of relatively small @xmath20 is motivated by the existence of the focus - point region , and the polonyi mainly decays into gravitinos in this case .",
    "the dotted line shows the upper bound on @xmath6 from the thermal production of gravitinos .",
    "the gray band shows the upper bound on @xmath6 from the polonyi coherent oscillation and thermal production , and the width of the band represents uncertainty of the polonyi abundance and couplings .",
    "the upper edge of the band corresponds to @xmath76 , while the lower one to @xmath53 , where @xmath40 .",
    "the polonyi mass is varied because it is strongly coupled with the inflaton @xmath54 @xmath77 , and the polonyi self interaction of the form @xmath78 with @xmath79 is expected in the khler potential . with the present parameter choice ,",
    "the bino is the lsp of mass @xmath80gev ( upper panel ) and @xmath81gev ( lower panel ) .",
    "the thermal relic abundance of the bino lsp is not taken into account in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , because it strongly depends on the mass spectrum .",
    "for instance , if it has a sizable mixing with higgsino or wino , the thermal relic abundance can be smaller than the present dm abundance .",
    "( in the latter case , we need to relax the gut relation on the gaugino mass . )",
    "we note that , in the lower panel , the constraint comes from the lsp overproduction from the gravitino / polonyi decay , hence all the constraints disappear if the r - parity is broken by a small amount .",
    "it is seen that the reheating temperature of @xmath82gev is allowed for @xmath83@xmath84gev .",
    "it is important that we do not need any additional late - time entropy production for solving the polonyi problem .",
    "thus the conventional polonyi model for the gravity - mediation for relatively heavy susy scale of @xmath8tev can be compatible with leptogenesis scenario once we assume the polonyi coupling to the inflaton is enhanced .",
    "now let us see if the above solution works in some known inflation models in supergravity . in particular , we will show that there are consistent parameter regions where thermal  @xcite or non - thermal  @xcite leptogenesis scenario works , avoiding the polonyi and gravitino problems .      first , let us consider the susy hybrid inflation model  @xcite .",
