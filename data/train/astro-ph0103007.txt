    "most of the radiation observed from blazars ( bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ) originates in relativistic jets , in which the emitting plasma flows with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath1 at small viewing angles @xmath2 .",
    "since the observed radiation is beamed in the direction of motion the large apparent luminosities are much reduced in the comoving frame , by a factor @xmath3 ( if @xmath4 ) in the case of a moving blob . on the other hand ,",
    "the most important power content of the jet is not in the form of internal random particle energy giving rise to radiation , but in the form of electromagnetic and kinetic powers associated with the bulk motion .",
    "this is indicated also by the power budget of the extended radio structures and radio lobes , which require an average supply which is greater than the luminosity generated by the jet at all scales .",
    "however , the jet does not need to remain relativistic for all its length , and indeed it was believed that it slows down , without losing much of its bulk kinetic energy content .",
    "in fact the detection of large  scale , symmetric jets has been considered as an indication that on such scales the plasma is moving at most with mildly relativistic velocities in low power fr  1 sources ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) , while the jet to counterjet flux ratio requires @xmath50.60.8 in fr  ii large  scale jets ( e.g. laing 1993 ; bridle et al .",
    "1994 ; wardle & aaron 1997 ; hardcastle et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , as these authors ( and laing et al .",
    "1999 ) pointed out , there is the possibility of a velocity structure across the jet , whose plasma could move highly relativistically close to the axis (  spine \" ) and mildly relativistic at the border (  slow layer \" ) . as found by chiaberge et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , celotti et al . ( 2001 ) , such a velocity structure can also help to unify radio ",
    "galaxies seen at large viewing angles and blazars .    observations of large scale jets emitting copious amounts of x  rays also suggest that jets might maintain ultra  relativistic speed up to the largest scales .",
    "we consider as a specific case that of the source pks 0637752 , observed by _",
    "chandra _ , for which observational information is available on both large and small scales .",
    "_ chandra _ observations reveal relatively intense x  ray emission quite far from the nucleus ( chartas et al .",
    "the spatially resolved x  ray images show knots of emission similar to those seen in radio maps ( tingay et al .",
    "1998 ) and optical images ( hst ; schwartz et al .",
    "vsop observations detected superluminal motion in the jet associated with the source ( lovell 2000 ) , setting a lower limit on the ( inner , i.e. pc scale ) bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 and an upper limit on the viewing angle @xmath7 degrees ( assuming @xmath8 km @xmath9 mpc@xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "furthermore the small scale jet appears to be well aligned with the kpc scale one : by de  projecting the x  ray map using an angle of 6 degrees the observed x ",
    "ray emission extends up to @xmath121 mpc from the nucleus .    as discussed by chartas et al . and schwartz et al . , on large scales",
    "the radio spectrum can be explained as synchrotron emission , as also supported by the detection of strong linear radio polarization , while the x  ray emission exceeds by a large factor ( @xmath12 2 orders of magnitude ) the extrapolation from the radio  optical spectrum . if the x  ray flux is synchrotron self ",
    "compton ( ssc ) radiation from plasma moving at most at mildly relativistic speed , then large deviations from equipartition between magnetic field and particle energy density and/or large inhomogeneities have to be invoked in the emitting region . on the other hand thermal emission by e.g. shocked plasma also appears to be unlikely , as it would imply high particle density and thus unobserved large rotation measures . on the other hand the x ",
    "ray flux can be satisfactorily interpreted as scattered cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) by relativistic plasma moving with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath131015 ( ghisellini 2000 ; celotti , ghisellini & chiaberge 2001 ; tavecchio et al .",
    "these observations then suggest that the jet , or some part of it , can indeed maintain highly ( bulk ) relativistic speeds from milli to megaparsec .    here",
    "we introduce another argument in support of large bulk lorentz factors along the entire jet extension .",
    "this is based on minimizing the power required to produce the radiation we observe , once we consider not only the dissipated radiative luminosity , but also the poynting flux and the particle bulk kinetic power of the jet .",
    "note that , as the power in bulk motion dominates over the internal particle energy , the minimum power criterion does not coincide with the equipartition argument usually applied to radio lobes ( burbidge 1959 ) .",
    "we show that the behaviourof the total power as function of the bulk lorentz factor depends on the dominant emission process ( chosen to reproduce the intrinsic quantities ) and has a minimum for a certain value of @xmath14 .    in the following we first explicitly derive the condition for the minimum total power requirement ( section 2 ) .",
    "this is applied to the x  ray extended emitting knot and small scale jet of pks 0637752 in section 3 .",
    "the implications for the energy transport in jets and some observational predictions are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars and more generally the emission by non  thermal plasma in relativistic jets can usually be represented by one or two broad components .",
    "these are commonly interpreted as synchrotron ( the low energy one ) and possibly inverse compton emission ( the high energy one , if present ) from a population of relativistic leptons . the seed photon population for the inverse",
    " compton scattering may be the synchrotron photons themselves ( synchrotron self ",
    "compton , ssc ) or photons produced externally to the emitting plasma .",
    "let us assume the simplest scenario and approximate the emitting region as a spherical ` blob ' of plasma of size @xmath15 , in bulk motion with lorentz factor @xmath14 at an angle @xmath2 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "this produces an intrinsic power @xmath16 in synchrotron radiation , and @xmath17 in inverse compton radiation .",
    "these are the luminosities as measured in the comoving frame .",
    "the corresponding dissipated luminosities ( i.e. the power received by a detector completely surrounding the source and which sees it moving with @xmath14 ) are enhanced by the factor @xmath18 .",
    "instead the ` observed ' luminosities @xmath19 and @xmath20 , estimated by multiplying the received flux by @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the luminosity distance ) , are a factor @xmath23 greater then the intrinsic ones . here",
    "@xmath24^{-1}$ ] is the doppler factor and @xmath25 the blob bulk velocity .",
    "the plasma comprises leptons ( protons ) of comoving density @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , embedded in a magnetic field of strength @xmath28 perpendicular to the direction of motion . the power carried as poynting flux and the kinetic powers corresponding to the bulk motion of leptons and protons",
    "are respectively given by : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the average random lorentz factor of the relativistic leptons , measured in the comoving frame , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the proton and electron rest masses , respectively .",
    "protons are assumed to be cold in the comoving frame .",
    "we can estimate these quantities from the observed radiation",
    ". a lower limit on @xmath26 can be inferred from the synchrotron emission @xmath19 of the plasma .",
    "in fact the number density of leptons producing the observed radiation is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is averaged over the relativistic electron distribution and @xmath35 is the thomson scattering cross section .",
    "the particle bulk kinetic powers can then be expressed as @xmath36 this implies that for a given size of the emitting region , @xmath14 , @xmath2 , observed synchrotron luminosity and spectrum ( which determines @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , the total power @xmath39 must have a minimum for some value of @xmath28 .",
    "a similar approach has been adopted for the case of the galactic superluminal source grs  1915@xmath40105 , for which @xmath14 and @xmath2 are known , by gliozzi , bodo & ghisellini ( 1999 ) . in the case of blazars",
    "the viewing angle is constrained by selection effects to be close to @xmath41 , since the flux is strongly dimmed for larger viewing angles , while the solid angle becomes too small for @xmath42 . under this further condition",
    ", the total power depends only on the product @xmath43 .",
    "in fact in this case @xmath44 , and then @xmath45 and @xmath46 behave in opposite ways with respect to @xmath47 .",
    "the value corresponding to the minimum total power can be easily determined by setting @xmath48 , to derive @xmath49 : @xmath50^{1/4};\\,\\,\\,\\ ,    \\delta=\\gamma.\\ ] ] the behaviours of the different powers and the resulting minimum of the total one are illustrated , as an example , in fig .  1 . here",
    "we represent their values as a function of @xmath43 in the case of  normal \" electron  proton ( @xmath51@xmath52 ) plasma and pure electron ",
    "positron ( @xmath53 ) pair plasma .",
    "-0.5 true cm    interestingly a second observational constraint allows us to decouple @xmath28 and @xmath14 .",
    "in fact the ratio of the luminosity in the inverse compton component to that in the synchrotron component ( hereafter the compton dominance ) is proportional to the ratio of the relevant energy densities , in radiation and magnetic field .",
    "consider first the case of inverse compton on photons produced externally to the jet .",
    "the ratio between the compton and synchrotron luminosities can be expressed as @xmath54 where the radiation energy density @xmath55 ( @xmath56 for viewing angles close to @xmath57 as in our case ; see dermer 1995 ) , in the comoving frame of a source at redshift @xmath58 includes e.g. the cmb radiation field for large scale structures @xmath59",
    "( @xmath60k is the temperature we observe now ) , and/or the photons of the broad line region on sub - pc scales @xmath61 , etc .",
    "thus the magnetic field required to give the observed @xmath62 ratio is simply @xmath63 using eqs . 3 and 6 we",
    "can then constrain the values of @xmath14 and @xmath28 which minimize the total bulk power and at the same time ensure the required compton over synchrotron luminosity ratio . note",
    "that @xmath64 while @xmath65 .",
    "on the other hand , the compton scattered radiation field can be dominated by synchrotron photons .",
    "clearly , this would be favoured ( for a given @xmath28 ) at low values of the bulk speed , such that the role of the external photons ( i.e. their comoving energy density ) is diminished in favour of the synchrotron ones ( sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) .",
    "in such situation the compton dominance is given by @xmath66 which leads to a value for the magnetic field @xmath67 resulting in @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    note that the dependence of @xmath70 and @xmath45 with respect to the bulk lorentz factor is radically different for these two possible origins of the high energy component .",
    "in the following we derive the minimum total power self  consistently , by taking into account which radiative process dominates for different values of @xmath28 and @xmath14 .",
    "consider the specific case of pks 0637752 , for which we have information on both the sub - pc and the extended jet .    in celotti",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) the spectrum of the x  ray knot wk7.8 was successfully fitted by adopting a one zone , homogeneous synchrotron and inverse compton model and assuming relativistic bulk motion . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "this was the key to explaining the strong x  ray emission ( because the cmb is seen in the comoving frame boosted by the factor @xmath71 and thus dominates over the locally produced synchrotron energy density , in turn enhancing the resulting x  ray emission ) .",
    "if the knot were not moving relativistically , many more leptons would be required to produced the observed x  rays , since in this case : i ) the flux would not be beamed and the intrinsic emitted luminosity would be larger ; ii ) the cmb would not be seen boosted and the inverse compton process on external photons would be less favoured .    specifically , the model parameters adopted by celotti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the knot emission of this source assumed a bulk lorentz factor @xmath72 , a viewing angle @xmath73 and a source dimension @xmath74 cm .",
    "note that the emitting region is resolved in the x ",
    "ray images and thus @xmath15 is not a free parameter . also the viewing angle is limited by the vsop observation of superluminal motion , but only to be @xmath75 at the pc scale ; as radio maps do not show any bending of the jet between the pc and @xmath76 kpc scales , we assume the large scale jet to be at a similar viewing angle .",
    "the average @xmath37 , @xmath38 derived by the spectral fitting are reasonably well constrained by the spectral slope and by interpreting the optical flux as due to synchrotron ( this limits the maximum lepton energy @xmath77 ) and the x  rays as due to inverse compton off the cmb .",
    "this latter constraint limits the minimum lorentz factor of the distribution , @xmath78 , to values smaller than @xmath1230 , thus reducing the ( usually large ) uncertainty on the total power associated with this parameter .",
    "note that although the particle distribution is also a function of the assumed @xmath28 and @xmath14 , this dependence has an almost negligible effect on the power estimates in constructing fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 , we have however taken into account the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath28 and @xmath14 by appropriately scaling in order to have the correct observed synchrotron peak frequency .    from all the above parameters we estimated the powers discussed in the previous section for the knot wk7.8 of pks  0637752 .",
    "the main point to be stressed is that the total power ( dominated by @xmath79 ) has a minimum for values of the lorentz factor extremely close to that determined by the spectral fit ( @xmath80 vs @xmath72 ) .",
    "this applies of course for an ordinary e ",
    "p plasma as @xmath79 is calculated assuming an equal number of protons and emitting electrons . at this minimum",
    "the contribution of the poynting flux is smaller ( by a factor @xmath1210 ) than @xmath79 and close to equipartition with the kinetic power associated with the emitting particles . indeed in the case of an e@xmath81 plasma , the total minimum",
    "is reached for @xmath1 at the equipartition between @xmath45 and @xmath82 .",
    "given the relative freedom on the viewing angle and the fact that a decrease in @xmath2 leads to a lowering of the total required power , we tried to find independent estimates of @xmath83 .",
    "in particular we considered the correlation found by rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) between the luminosity in the narrow line emission and the power required for jets to supply the extended lobe energy in their lifetime . from the luminosity in",
    "@xmath84 $ ] ( tadhunter et al . 1993 ) we were able to estimate  following rawlings & saunders prescription  the total luminosity in narrow lines @xmath85 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "according to the above correlation this corresponds to @xmath86 erg s@xmath10 , although the correlation has ( large ! ) uncertainties , and no energy other than that associated with the relativistic emitting particles in the radio lobes is assumed .",
    "-0.3 true cm    -0.3 true cm    consequently we explored the possibility of a viewing angle smaller than @xmath87 .",
    "in particular we report here the case of @xmath88 , which roughly corresponds to a minimum power similar to that determined from the lobe energy content and line luminosity .",
    "the results are graphically displayed in fig .",
    "similarly to the case already discussed the minimum value of the total power is reached for a bulk lorentz factor extremely close to that inferred independently from the spectral fit ( which required @xmath89 and therefore almost the same @xmath28field as before but a smaller intrinsic luminosity ) . in this case @xmath79 and @xmath45 are closer to equipartition and about a factor 8 lower than for @xmath90 .",
    "we also considered analogous estimates for the core ( blazar ) component of pks  0637752 , assuming @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 cm , @xmath94 erg s@xmath10 , @xmath95 1 pc , @xmath96 g , resulting in @xmath97 and @xmath98 erg @xmath99 .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "no consistent solution can be found at low @xmath14 , where the dissipated power exceeds the total power carried by the jet .",
    "in addition , @xmath14@xmath10018 is implied by the observed superluminal motion .",
    "close to @xmath101 , the total power ( once again dominated by @xmath79 ) presents a flattening ( not really a minimum ) at a value similar to that on extended scales and again for a @xmath14 close to that inferred from the spectral fit ( @xmath92 ) , and not far from equipartition of the magnetic field and lepton components .",
    "the two figures ( 2 and 3 ) also show in the upper panels the corresponding mass fluxes @xmath102 , estimated assuming one proton per lepton , and the doppler factors . again on both scales a minimum in @xmath102 is reached close to the minimum power condition and corresponds to values @xmath103 yr@xmath10 .",
    "this can be compared with the accreting mass flux ( note that at small scales entrainment is not likely to be substantial ) .",
    "if we consider a covering factor @xmath104 of the narrow line emitting gas , the corresponding ionizing ( disc ) emission requires an accretion flow of @xmath105 yr@xmath10 for a radiative efficiency of @xmath106 : only about 1 per cent of the mass would need to be channeled and accelerated in jets to ultra  relativistic speeds .",
    "we have considered the implications of observed spectral quantities , namely the synchrotron ( low energy ) and inverse compton ( high energy ) components which dominate the emission of extragalactic jets . besides the total radiated luminosity , these quantities allow to estimate the corresponding bulk kinetic and magnetic powers as functions of the assumed bulk lorentz factor .    in particular it is possible to perform such estimates also for large scales jets which has been seen by @xmath0 .",
    "we have therefore analysed the case of pks 0637752 , for which broad band emission has been observed from both the blazar ( sub - pc ) and the extended jet .    for the range of observing angles consistent with superluminal constraints",
    "we find that : a ) the total power is minimized for relativistic bulk lorentz factor larger than 10 ; b ) the ` fitting ' of the observed spectral energy distribution implies physical parameters which lie close to this minimum in the total power .",
    "these findings somehow lend support to the hypothesis of highly relativistic motion on the hundred  kiloparsec scale in jets , given the already high values of the estimated powers , which appear to be close to the limits of the proposed power production mechanisms in agn .",
    "note that the possible range of total power spans about three and the ratio @xmath107 about eight orders of magnitude .",
    "furthermore even the minimum power inferred ( referring only to the non  thermal emitting jet plasma ) is of order 10@xmath108 erg s@xmath10 , pushing ( once again ) the requirement for any powering mechanism .    within the acceptable range of viewing angles , a specific choice of @xmath109 provides absolute values for the total power which well agree with both @xmath83 derived on sub  pc scale and the jet power estimated from the lobe energy content ( but note that this ` solution ' implies to double the already large linear dimension of the jet ) .    in other words",
    "it appears that jets are in the most energetically economic conditions for the given emitted radiation and spectrum , i.e. that there is a close link between the total power , the dimension , the particle distribution and the intensity of the field . despite of this",
    "the inferred radiative efficiency turns out to be only of the order @xmath110  @xmath111 , for the nuclear and extended regions , respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that such low radiative efficiencies in the kpc  scale jet , and their higher values on smaller scales , may be a natural outcome of the internal  shock blazars scenario ( e.g. ghisellini 2000 ; spada et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in these conditions",
    "the mass flux in the jet corresponds to about one per cent of the mass flux accreting on the central source ( for @xmath112 ) , as deduced from the luminosity of the narrow lines .",
    "it is relevant to comment on the possibility of an e@xmath81 dominated jet .",
    "solutions close to the minimum total power for ultra ",
    "relativistic large ( and small ) scale jets can also be obtained .",
    "furthermore such solutions appear to be intriguingly close to equipartition values of @xmath82 and @xmath45 .",
    "however , if the emission line luminosity is a measure of the lobe energetics , then @xmath113 is too small to power the radio lobe , implying a contribution from the proton component , thus limiting the maximum pair content to 56 pairs per proton .    on large scales",
    "the minimum power condition also corresponds to a situation of quasi ",
    "equipartition between the magnetic and kinetic power transported in the jet .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask whether there is a simple and robust way for the particle bulk motion and the magnetic field components to reach it .",
    "theoretical studies of relativistic hydromagnetic flows ( e.g. li , chiueh & begelman 1992 ; begelman & li 1994 and references therein ) have shown that rough equipartition between particle ( kinetic ) and poynting flux is indeed a quite natural outcome for reasonable assumptions for the boundary conditions , with poynting flux gradually accelerating matter .    clearly , various types of blazars present different spectral characteristics and radiated luminosities .",
    "we are already considering the implications for the total power involved obtained in the different cases ( ghisellini & celotti 2001 , in prep ) .",
    "a further analysis we intend to perform is on data relative to the extended emission from radio galaxies , in particular to estimate the energetics which might be associated with a slower moving ( external ) layer .",
    "a final point to be stressed concerning the recent and future @xmath0 observations is that although the procedure for the determination of powers is similar for the small and large  scale jets , the large  scale powers are much better determined because the energy density of the external radiation field is well known .",
