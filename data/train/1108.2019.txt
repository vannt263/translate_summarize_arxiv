    "nucleon charges defined as matrix elements of vector , axial and tensor currents between nucleon states contain complete information about quark structure of the nucleon .",
    "these charges are connected with the leading twist unpolarized @xmath0 , the helicity @xmath1 and transversity @xmath2 parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the first two pdfs have been extensively investigated theoretically and experimentally in many works ( for instance see @xcite and references therein as well as @xcite ) .",
    "there is a big experimental problem to measure the transversity of the nucleon because of its chiral odd nature . only , recently the tensor charge @xmath2 was extracted @xcite using the data from belle @xcite , hermes @xcite and compass @xcite collaborations . this extraction is based on analysis of the measured azimuthal asymmetries in semi - inclusive scattering and those in @xmath3 processes .",
    "since @xmath2 is a spin dependent pdf , it is interesting to investigate whether there is a `` transversity crisis '' similar to the case of `` spin crisis '' in @xmath1 .",

    "using the most general form of the nucleon interpolating field , we study the tensor form factors of nucleons within light cone qcd sum rules ( lcqsr ) .",
    "the lcqsr is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) over twist of the operators near the light cone , while in the traditional qcd sum rules , the ope is performed over dimensions of the operators . this approach has been widely applied to hadron physics ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "note that , the tensor form factors of nucleons up to @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the euclidean momentum transfer square ) within the @xmath6 chiral soliton model are studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
