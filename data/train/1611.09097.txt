    "the above description only links the dynamics ( frequency ) of ( at least ) the upper khz qpo to the spectral properties of the source , but it does not address the mechanism that determines the emission properties of the qpos .",
    "for example , the steep increase of the rms amplitude of the khz qpos with energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this model can explain the rms and time - lag energy spectra of the lower khz qpo @xcite in the ns lmxb 4u 160852 .",
    "this scenario also provides a framework to interpret our findings in terms of a coupling and an efficient energy exchange between the disc and the corona . since in the observations in which the lower khz qpo is present the changes of the temperature of the corona are relatively small ( at least compared to the relative changes of the optical depth ) , the frequency range spanned by this qpo likely reflects the range of optical depths ( electron density ) in the corona at which the resonance is excited .",
    "we define the optical depth of the corona as @xmath74 @xcite , where @xmath75 is the size of the corona , @xmath76 @xmath77 is the thomson cross section of the electron , and @xmath78 is the electron density . if we take 5 and 20 as extreme values of @xmath53 in our fits ( see figure [ fig : sa_qpo_sigma ] ) , then @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xmath81 for @xmath75 in the range of 4 and 15 km @xcite , respectively",
    ". these values are consistent with the typical electron density in the corona of neutron star or black hole systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting that in 4u 163653 the frequency at which ( i ) the lower khz qpo is most often detected @xcite , ( ii ) the quality factor ( @xmath83 , defined as the qpo frequency divided by the full - width at half - maximum ) of the lower khz qpo is the highest @xcite , and ( iii ) the coherence between the low- and high - energy signals is the highest @xcite , is always @xmath84 hz .",
    "furthermore , @xcite recently showed that the phase lag between the low- and high - energy photons in the lower khz qpo in 4u 163653 is largest at @xmath85 , which also corresponds to a qpo frequency of @xmath84 hz .",
    "all the above suggests that this frequency corresponds to a global oscillation mode of the accretion flow in this source ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the mode could possibly be excited over a fairly large range of values of the properties of the corona ( e.g. , @xmath53 , @xmath55 and @xmath75 ) , and hence over a range of frequencies of the qpo , as observed .",
    "on the other hand , the excitation and damping mechanisms of this global mode of the corona will play a role upon the range of frequencies and the coherence of the qpo . in a follow - up paper ( ribeiro et al .",
    "2017 , in preparation ) we discuss correlations between the rms amplitude of the qpos and the spectral properties of the source , which provide further support to this scenario .",
