    "worldwide , large efforts are being made to interface single atoms with single photons , since this is the key to the entanglement @xcite and teleportation @xcite of quantum states between distant atoms .",
    "transform - limited and mutually coherent single photons in well - defined polarisation and spatio - temporal field modes are needed so that the desired quantum - correlation effects occur @xcite . some crucial problems that arise in the production of such photons",
    "have been solved , such as the choice of an adequate emitter , the efficient collection of the emitted photons or their channelling into a given direction . in particular ,",
    "several research groups have demonstrated that strongly coupled atom - cavity systems can be used as deterministic sources of single photons @xcite . in these experiments , a single atom located in the cavity",
    "is exposed to laser pulses which drive one branch of a raman transition .",
    "the other branch is resonant with the cavity mode so that the field mode of the cavity receives one photon upon each successful raman transition .",
    "the photons are finally emitted from the cavity , and hanbury brown & twiss photon - correlation measurements are used to demonstrate the single - photon nature of the emission .    in this article",
    ", we propose to extend this photon - generation scheme in such a way that single photons of well - defined polarisation are emitted from a coupled atom - cavity system .",
    "this new method is based on our previous work @xcite , where raman transitions between hyperfine states of a @xmath0rb atom were used to generate single photons .",
    "the large number of accessible magnetic sublevels in @xmath0rb meant that the polarisation of these photons was undefined . in order to achieve polarisation control ,",
    "we now investigate the situation shown in fig.[fig:1-principle ] .",
    "vacuum - stimulated raman transitions are considered between the @xmath1 zeeman substates of an @xmath2 hyperfine state , e.g. in the electronic ground state of @xmath3rb atoms .",
    "we assume a magnetic field along the cavity axis that lifts the degeneracy of the magnetic substates .",
    "if the frequency of the applied laser pulses is either red or blue detuned from the unperturbed transition by twice the b - field induced zeeman shift , while the cavity frequency is in resonance with the unperturbed atomic transition , then the transition between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 levels is resonantly driven by laser and cavity , but with their roles changing as a function of the chosen laser detuning . in this way",
    "the raman transition can be driven in one or the other direction , leading to an emission of either @xmath6 or @xmath7 photons . as can be seen in the level scheme shown in fig.[fig:1-principle ]",
    ", this method requires the laser to be polarised perpendicular to the cavity axis , so that it decomposes into @xmath6 and @xmath7 polarisation components with respect to the magnetic field direction .",
    "only the @xmath6 polarisation component of the driving laser is used for the generation of a @xmath7 polarised photon and vice versa .",
    "the other polarisation component of the laser pulse is always present , but it is out - of - resonance with all relevant atomic transitions .    as the cavity supports both polarisation modes , alternating the laser frequency between the two possible resonances from pulse to pulse should be sufficient to generate a sequence of single photons of alternating polarisation .",
    "no repumping of the atom to its initial state is required from one photon to the next , since the final state reached with a @xmath6 photon emission is at the same time the initial state for producing a @xmath7 photon with the subsequent driving laser pulse , and vice versa . with this novel scheme",
    ", one should therefore be able to produce sequences of photons with well - defined polarisation .",
    "for an illustration of the photon generation process , we first consider an idealised atom with an @xmath2 hyperfine ground state and an @xmath8 electronically excited state . the zeeman shift induced by the magnetic field on the @xmath9 atomic ground states",
    "is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the bohr magneton and @xmath12 the land factor . in the following the @xmath13 zeeman substates of the @xmath2 ground state will be written as @xmath14,@xmath15 and @xmath16 , whereas the @xmath8 excited state is labelled @xmath17 . for geometric reasons",
    "the cavity supports only @xmath6 and @xmath7 photons , which have identical frequencies if the relevant cavity modes are degenerate .",
    "the state of the coupled atom - cavity system can therefore be written as a superposition of product states @xmath18 , with @xmath19 representing the atomic state , and @xmath20 denoting the number of @xmath21 photons . in this paper",
    "we restrict the number of photons in each mode to zero or one , since higher photon numbers are very unlikely .",
    "note that the cavity couples only product states of different photon numbers , while the interaction of the atom with the pump laser leaves the intra - cavity photon number unchanged . the pump frequency @xmath22 and",
    "the cavity resonance frequency @xmath23 are both close to the @xmath15 to @xmath17 transition frequency @xmath24 .",
    "we also disregard the states @xmath25 , since @xmath15 is decoupled from all other internal states . in this way an atomic three - level system in a @xmath26-configuration is obtained .",
    "here , we choose the energy of the excited state @xmath27 to define the origin of the energy scale and we divide the hamiltonian of the system into two parts , @xmath28 .",
    "the stationary part @xmath29 includes the energy levels of atom and cavity , and @xmath30 describes the interaction of the atom with pump laser and cavity . the system is examined in the interaction picture . in the rotating wave approximation ,",
    "the stationary part of the hamiltonian reads    @xmath31 + \\hbar\\delta_{cp}\\left(\\hat{a}^{\\dag}\\hat{a}+ \\hat{b}^{\\dag}\\hat{b}\\right),\\label{eq : hstat}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the detuning of the pump laser from the transition between @xmath15 and @xmath17 and @xmath33 is the difference between cavity resonance and pump laser frequency . here ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 , or @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are the creation and annihilation operators of a photon in the @xmath6 or @xmath7 polarised cavity mode , respectively . the interaction between atom and cavity",
    "is given by the interaction hamiltonian    @xmath38 , \\label{eq : hint}\\ ] ]    where g is the coupling constant of the atom to both cavity modes ( assumed to be equal ) , and @xmath39 is the rabi frequency of the pump laser .",
    "the cavity decay gives rise to the emission of photons from the cavity , which is a non - unitary process .",
    "it can not be included in a hermitian hamiltonian , but its effects on the density matrix can be expressed by the liouville operator @xcite , @xmath40= \\kappa \\left(2\\hat a \\hat{\\rho}\\hat a^{\\dag } -",
    "\\hat a^{\\dag}\\hat a \\hat{\\rho } -",

    "the time evolution of the system is then given by the master equation @xmath42 + \\hat{l}[\\hat{\\rho } ] .\\label{eq : mastereq}\\ ] ] note that a similar raman process driven in only one direction has been discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "here , we search for conditions where raman transitions can be driven in both directions , albeit with the cavity frequency fixed .",
    "this imposes new constraints , and we now have to determine the optimal parameters for efficient production of @xmath6 and @xmath7 photons .",
    "the initial state of the system is set to @xmath43 and realistic cavity parameters are chosen , @xmath44mhz ( e.g. corresponding to a @xmath3rb atom in the 5s@xmath45 hyperfine ground state and excitation of the d@xmath46-line , inside a cavity used in former experiments @xcite and a magnetic field of 21.4 g ) .",
    "the cavity is in resonance with the @xmath15 to @xmath17 transition , ( i.e. @xmath47 ) , and in order to resonantly drive the raman transition from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , the pump laser has to have a detuning of @xmath50 .",
    "the pump - laser rabi frequency follows a @xmath51-pulse amplitude with a peak value of @xmath52mhz for each polarisation , as shown in fig.[fig:2-ideal](a ) .",
    "the probability density for emitting a photon varies as a function of time , and reflects the envelope of the generated single - photon wave packet .",
    "note that the shape of the photon depends on the driving field .",
    "changing the shape of the pump pulse or its peak value has a direct impact on the emission probability .",
    "the photon can therefore be shaped in many desired ways .",
    "the integral of the probability density over the whole photon duration gives the overall emission probability of a photon , here it measures @xmath53 .",
    "the lower part of fig.[fig:2-ideal](a ) illustrates the population inversion between the states @xmath54 and @xmath16 , which is here the population difference between the final and the initial atomic state .",
    "the inversion starts from @xmath55 at @xmath56 and increases until it reaches @xmath57 .",
    "note that any losses out of the system ( except for cavity decay ) have been omitted in this simplified model , therefore population which is not transferred into the other ground state simply stays in the initial state .",
    "under these conditions , the emission probability equals the fraction of transferred population .",
    "this is not the case in general , since other loss channels than the cavity might exist .    during the population transfer from the state @xmath58 to @xmath59 ,",
    "the single photon state of the cavity decays . since the time constant 2@xmath41 is much faster than the duration of the pump pulse , the photon leaks out of the cavity during its generation .",
    "once the atom has reached the state @xmath60 , it will be very unlikely to undergo another raman transition back to the initial state , since the back transition is detuned by @xmath61 ( see fig.[fig:1-principle ] ( b ) , grey lines ) which is much larger than the cavity linewidth of 2@xmath41 .",
    "this means a second emission is suppressed and thus only a single @xmath6 or @xmath7 photon is generated .",
    "the efficiency of the photon generation depends on many parameters .",
    "here it is @xmath53 , but it can rise up to @xmath62 with increasing pump power or with a stronger atom - cavity coupling . for",
    "a larger zeeman splitting the emission probability would decrease .",
    "exactly the same photon generation efficiency and photon envelope are obtained when the initial state is @xmath63 and the detuning of the pump laser frequency is @xmath64 .",
    "then raman resonance is fulfilled for the @xmath26-type transition shown in fig.[fig:1-principle ] ( c ) and a @xmath7 photon is generated .",
    "both cases are similar , since the cavity frequency has been chosen to be on the unshifted transition from @xmath2 to @xmath8 , leading to an atom - cavity detuning of @xmath65 with respect to the atomic resonances from @xmath16 to @xmath17 and @xmath66 to @xmath17 .",
    "this symmetry is only broken when we detune the cavity . in fig.[fig:2-ideal](b ) , the photon generation efficiencies are plotted as a function of the cavity - atom detuning , @xmath67 , with the pump frequency always chosen in such a way that laser and cavity are in raman resonance with either the @xmath16 to @xmath54 or the @xmath54 to @xmath16 transition , i.e. @xmath68 .",
    "black lines indicate the probability to emit a @xmath7 photon and grey lines a @xmath6 photon .",
    "the solid lines give the efficiencies for the photon production within the desired @xmath26-type raman transitions , i.e. starting in @xmath16 and ending in @xmath54 for @xmath6 or vice versa for @xmath7 photons . driving",
    "a @xmath26-type transition with a cavity - atom detuning around @xmath69 for @xmath6 photons ( grey line ) or @xmath70 for @xmath7 photons ( black line ) leads to 100@xmath71 efficiency of the process . in both cases ,",
    "the detuning of the cavity compensates the zeeman shift and both arms of the raman resonance coincide with an atomic resonance .",
    "however , to generate @xmath6 and @xmath7 polarised photons with the same probability in case of a fixed cavity detuning , we have to accept a compromise , i.e. @xmath72 with an emission probability reduced to @xmath53 .    to verify whether no unwanted second photon will emerge from the system",
    ", we also have calculated the probability for a photon production from an atom starting in the wrong initial state , e.g. state @xmath54 for @xmath6 photons .",
    "if @xmath6 photons can be generated in this case , the atom would undergo a cycling transition , since initial and final state are the same . as indicated by the grey dashed line",
    "( black dashed line for the analogous case with @xmath7 photons ) in fig.[fig:2-ideal](b ) the probability for such cycling transitions is close to zero in the frequency range around @xmath72 , where the scheme for generating photons of alternating polarisation works best , so no second photon will be emitted .",
    "only when the pump laser accidently hits an atomic resonance does the emission probability become non - negligible .",
    "this phenomenon is however an artefact of our simplified model , the peaks appearing because the spontaneous decay of the excited atomic state has been omitted .",
    "consequently , once the atom is in the excited state it can only emit into the far - off resonant cavity mode . in a real atom the spontaneous decay to other states would dominate the atom s behaviour .",
    "this is discussed in more detail below .",
    "this simple model shows that , for @xmath72 , single - photon polarisation control can be achieved by choosing the appropriate pump - laser frequencies .",
    "there is no need to alter the cavity frequency or the pump polarisation .",
    "moreover , the probability to emit two photons during the same pump pulse is vanishingly small .",
    "to analyse the behaviour of a coupled atom - cavity system under more realistic conditions , all relevant atomic levels and the spontaneous decay of the excited states must be taken into account .",
    "as an example we consider the d@xmath46-line of @xmath3rb .",
    "its 5s@xmath73 ground state decomposes into two hyperfine states , @xmath74 , with @xmath756.8ghz hyperfine splitting , while the 5p@xmath73 excited state has four hyperfine substates , @xmath76 , with splittings of @xmath75(72 ; 157 ; 267)mhz .",
    "the two 5s@xmath77(@xmath2,@xmath9 ) states are the @xmath78 states in our scheme , while the virtual excited level of the raman transition is some superposition of 5p@xmath73(@xmath79=0 ) states .",
    "note that the origin of our energy scale is chosen to coincide with @xmath8 .",
    "this state is still labelled @xmath17 . in the ground state ,",
    "@xmath80 is so far from resonance with pump and cavity that there is effectively no coupling .",
    "therefore spontaneous emissions into @xmath80 constitute an additional loss channel , but the state as such need not be considered .",
    "moreover , we restrict ourselves to a situation where the cavity frequency is near resonant with the transitions from @xmath2 to @xmath81 . with a distance of @xmath75157mhz between @xmath82 and @xmath83 ,",
    "the latter state is far from resonance .",
    "combined with the fact that the dipole - matrix elements for transitions between @xmath2 and @xmath83 are smaller than those for the relevant transitions to @xmath81 the @xmath83 state can be neglected .",
    "we also omit the @xmath84 state , since it does not couple to @xmath2 .",

    "the extension of the model makes the prediction of the emission probability more difficult .",
    "the influence of certain atomic bare states increases or decreases depending on their distance from the virtual excited level of the raman transition . only from a numerical simulation of the scheme , using the master equation ( [ eq : mastereq ] ) with the extended hamiltonian and liouvillian from eq.([eq : hstat_all]-[liouville_loss ] ) , do we gain more insight into the physical processes .        in fig.[fig:3-real](a )",
    "the calculated emission probability is shown as a function of the cavity - atom detuning @xmath114 , with the black lines again showing emission probabilities for @xmath7 photons and grey lines for @xmath6 photons .",
    "compared to fig.[fig:2-ideal](b ) , the symmetry around @xmath47 is lost . at this frequency the probabilities for @xmath6 and @xmath7 photon emissions differ from one another although the cavity is in resonance with an atomic transition .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood because the influence of the @xmath82 state becomes larger the closer the virtual exited level is to this state . for a cavity - atom detuning of @xmath72 ,",
    "the virtual excited level is between @xmath8 and @xmath82 for the @xmath6 process , but below the @xmath8 level for @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the detuning of the virtual level with respect to the atomic bare states determines the sign of the transition amplitudes .",
    "therefore the two possible path of the raman transition ( via @xmath8 and @xmath82 ) interfere either constructively or destructively .",
    "although the former symmetry is lost , three cavity - atom detunings @xmath114 are found where the efficiencies for @xmath6 and @xmath7 photon production are equal .",
    "one is almost half - way between the two atomic resonances , and the other two are close to the @xmath2 to @xmath8 and @xmath2 to @xmath82 resonances . for the latter two cavity frequencies ,",
    "the probability for generating a photon starting from the wrong initial state is below @xmath115 ( fig.[fig:3-real](a ) , dashed lines ) .",
    "this is an upper limit for the probability of generating a second photon after a first emission , if the process is started from the right initial state .",
    "for instance , at @xmath116mhz , the equal probabilities for @xmath6 and @xmath7 photon emission reach a maximum of @xmath117 .",
    "the time evolution of the system for this detuning is shown in fig.[fig:3-real](b ) .",
    "the atom is exposed to the same pump pulse ( shape and amplitude ) for both directions of the raman process .",
    "although the probabilities for @xmath6 and @xmath7 photon emission are equal , the envelopes of the emitted photons differ , as can be seen in the probability - density plot .",
    "in fact , the virtual levels for the two transitions are not at the same energy and their transition amplitudes have different values . to produce identical photons",
    ", one could eventually compensate for this by choosing suitably shaped pump pulses for @xmath6 and @xmath7 processes .",
    "this is , however , beyond the scope of this article .",
    "differences in the two processes can also be seen in the population transfer from the initial to the final state , see fig.[fig:3-real](b ) .",
    "it is more successful for @xmath6 photons , which indicates that the losses to non - coupled states are higher when a @xmath7 photon is generated .",
    "note that these losses never exceed @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , from the low probability of the wrong transition to take place , we conclude that the starting conditions for a photon of opposite polarisation are always met once a first photon has been emitted . therefore generating a sequence of photons of alternating polarisation seems feasible .",
    "we have seen that the production of a photon when the atom is initially in the wrong zeeman state is unlikely .",
    "we now show that one can address either the @xmath54 to @xmath16 or the @xmath16 to @xmath54 transition by choosing the appropriate pump laser frequencies . for a fixed cavity - atom detuning of @xmath116mhz , fig.([fig:4 ] ) shows the calculated emission probabilities as a function of the cavity - pump detuning , @xmath119 .",
    "again the pump laser rabi frequency follows a pulse amplitude as shown in fig.[fig:3-real](b ) .",
    "the raman resonance of laser and cavity at @xmath120 leads to sharp peaks in the photon emission probability for @xmath26 transitions while cycling processes are only visible around @xmath121 . ]",
    "as expected , we find maxima in the photon emission probability whenever raman resonance conditions are met .",
    "starting from state @xmath54 , the emission probability for @xmath7 photons shows a maximum at a pump laser detuning of @xmath122mhz , and similarly starting from state @xmath16 we find a maximum in the emission probability of @xmath6 photons for @xmath123mhz . the emission probability amounts to @xmath117 , as discussed before .",
    "note that the rayleigh scattering peak at @xmath121 dominates the spectrum .",
    "it exceeds 100% emission probability , since the pump laser hits the cavity resonance and the atom undergoes a cycling transition . for this reason ,",
    "more than one photon per pulse can be emitted .",
    "these cycling transitions are more pronounced for @xmath6 photons , since here the virtual excited level of the raman transition is closer to a real atomic level . to guarantee single - photon emission in our scheme , transitions where two photons are possibly emitted have to be avoided .",
    "since the width of the resonances depends on the cavity decay rate 2@xmath41 , the magnetic field has to be chosen high enough to ensure that the separation of the transition lines significantly exceeds 2@xmath41 . for the zeeman splitting considered here the raman resonances",
    "are well resolved and the scheme is not disturbed by cycling transitions , as can be seen in fig.([fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the calculations discussed in this paper are based on the parameters of an atom - cavity system that has been studied experimentally in our group @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "@xmath0rb was used and the raman transitions were driven between two different hyperfine ground states .",
    "the zeeman structure of the levels was not important .",
    "moreover , a repumping laser was necessary to re - establish the starting conditions after each photon emission .",
    "the scheme proposed here could easily be implemented if @xmath3rb atoms were used and a magnetic field was applied . with the pump frequency",
    "being switched from one pulse to the next in a way that the raman transition is either driven from @xmath124 to @xmath125 or vice versa , a stream of photons with alternating polarisation is expected .",
    "no time - consuming repumping will be needed , so that the photon - emission rate increases .",
    "the simulations show that equal efficiencies can be obtained for the production of @xmath6 and @xmath7 photons when an appropriate cavity - atom detuning is used .",
    "the efficiency is 74@xmath71 for a cavity resonance close to the @xmath2 to @xmath82 transition frequency .",
    "the losses to other states are small , which guarantees that after a first emission the atom is well prepared to produce a subsequent photon .",
    "the realisation of this scheme seems promising .",
    "since the produced photons have a well defined polarisation , they can be directed along arbitrary paths .",
