    "two - dimensional electronic systems , as found in single heterojunction interfaces or in more complex structures such as quantum wells , have been studied intensively because of their fundamental interest and for their potential application@xcite . in particular , the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with a spatially periodic modulation of its equilibrium density has attracted considerable attention both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite . one way of achieving these systems@xcite is to apply a voltage between a patterned gate and the 2deg , thereby inducing a one - dimensional periodic modulation of the density . as the gate voltage is increased , electrons tend to ` pool ' near the minima of the modulating potential and , in the limit of strong modulation , the system transforms into a periodic array of 1d quantum wires .",
    "it is clear that the restricted motion of the electrons along the wires will have a profound effect on the character of the plasma excitations in the system .",
    "our main focus in this paper will be to study the evolution of these collective modes with increasing modulation of the 2deg , and in particular , the crossover from 2d to 1d behaviour .",
    "the theoretical approaches commonly used to discuss collective excitations in charge - density - modulated systems can be classified broadly as being either hydrodynamic in nature@xcite , or based on the random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite . the hydrodynamic approaches are appealing because of their relative mathematical and computational simplicity .",
    "although they vary in their level of sophistication , they all have in common the objective of describing the dynamics of the electronic system in terms of a closed set of equations for the density and velocity fields . at the simplest level of approximation@xcite",
    ", the current density in the electron fluid is determined by a local conductivity , proportional to the equilibrium electron density .",
    "poisson s equation is then used to relate the electric field driving the current to the fluctuating electron density . rather than explicitly determining the equilibrium properties of the electronic system ,",
    "the equilibrium density is simply chosen to have some physically reasonable form .",
    "we shall refer to such theories as ` classical ' in that no explicit quantum mechanical aspects are included in either the equilibrium or dynamical properties .    although the classical treatment is useful for obtaining a qualitative understanding of the collective modes in a modulated 2deg , it has the shortcoming of not being able to account for nonlocal effects ( e.g. in the magneto - conductivity tensor ) which become important with increasing magnitude of the plasmon wavevector .",
    "nonlocal effects in the plasmon dispersion can be included in the hydrodynamic theory through the introduction of an electronic compressibility@xcite . in this way",
    "some information about the quantum mechanical equation of state can be built into the theory . in this respect , these theories can be referred to as ` semiclassical ' .",
    "the rpa on the other hand , provides a fully quantum mechanical description of both the equilibrium and dynamical behaviour .",
    "however , being more general , the computational demands for its implementation are significantly greater .",
    "furthermore , since it includes both single - particle and collective aspects , it is sometimes difficult to cleanly identify excitations which are predominantly collective in nature@xcite . for both of these reasons ,",
    "it is still worthwhile having available hydrodynamic based theories .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the collective response of a modulated 2deg using the thomas - fermi - dirac - von weizscker ( tfdw ) hydrodynamics previously developed to treat magnetoplasma excitations in three - dimensional parabolic wells@xcite and electron rings@xcite .",
    "one of the primary virtues of this approach is that it is based on a reasonably accurate description of the ground state properties of the electronic system , which are determined self - consistently from the minimization of the tfdw energy functional .",
    "thus , unlike most earlier hydrodynamic treatments , the form of the equilibrium density is not chosen arbitrarily .",
    "perturbations of the system away from the equilibrium state generate internal forces which drive the system back towards equilibrium .",
    "these forces are consistently included in the tfdw hydrodynamic equations used to describe the dynamics of the system .",
    "although somewhat more sophisticated , the present approach nevertheless retains much of the mathematical simplicity of the usual hydrodynamic theories .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ equilibrium ] we determine the equilibrium properties of a periodically modulated 2deg within the tfdw approximation .",
    "[ collective ] then provides the mathematical formalism needed to study the dynamics of the collective modes and includes a derivation of the power absorption which is typically measured in infrared transmission experiments . in sec .",
    "[ 2dto1d ] , we consider in detail the crossover from 2d to 1d behavior in the periodically - modulated 2deg , and finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we present our concluding remarks .",
    "the fabrication of mesoscopic devices often begins with a 2deg in metal - oxide - semiconductor ( mos ) structures or epitaxially grown heterojunctions . in these systems , the strong confinement of the electrons in the direction normal to",
    "the interface leads to a discrete spectrum of quantized subband states , while motion in the lateral dimensions is essentially free . in the limit",
    "that electronic excitations take place within only a single subband , the system can be idealized as strictly two - dimensional with no spatial extent in the normal direction .",
    "in this situation , the electronic density has the form @xmath0 , where the planar density @xmath1 is defined by whatever additional lateral confining potential @xmath2 is imposed on the system .    to determine the equilibrium density distribution @xmath1",

    "this formulation of the equilibrium properties of the electronic system is quite general in the sense that the physical situation is completely specified by the form of the external potential . for the case of 1d modulation",
    ", the potential @xmath19 will be assumed to be a smooth , periodic function of @xmath20 with period @xmath21 .",
    "this potential can of course be represented as a fourier series , but we shall consider only the simplest form @xmath22 having a single fourier component .",
    "this choice is sufficient to investigate the important effects of modulation on the properties of a 2deg , and has been applied successfully by other workers @xcite to model laterally microstructured field - effect devices used in fir experiments .",
    "the translational invariance of the system along the @xmath23-direction , together with the periodicity of the external confining potential , implies that the solution to eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) will only depend on @xmath20 and will have the property that @xmath24 .",
    "thus , we can restrict our calculation to the unit cell @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "for potentials such as ( [ modpot ] ) with inversion symmetry about the center of the cell , the desired solutions are those satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath26 to complete the determination of @xmath27 , we must finally impose the normalization condition @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the average electron density in the modulated 2deg .    before discussing the nature of the ground state solution to eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) , we first note some technical points involved in the calculation . as is typical of dft schemes , the solutions are obtained using an iterative procedure , and issues of numerical stability and convergence therefore arise .",
    "the usual source of numerical instabilities is the long - ranged nature of the coulomb interaction .",
    "in the course of iterating , a small deviation of the charge density from its true value leads to a change in the effective potential that tends to induce an overcompensating screening charge on the next iteration . in our particular case",
    ", this results in an oscillation of the charge between the central and outer regions of the unit cell , which inhibits the desired convergence of the iterative procedure . this problem can be remedied by a combination of two strategies .",
    "first , we introduce an algebraic mixing of the effective potential    @xmath30~+~(1 - \\alpha)~ v_{\\rm eff}^{(i)}\\ , , \\label{amix}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 is the effective potential on the @xmath32-th iteration , @xmath33 is the density generated by this potential and @xmath34 $ ] is the effective potential that this density would lead to .",
    "the mixing parameter @xmath35 lies between zero and one and reducing its value reduces the change in the potential from one iteration to the next .",
    "this by itself will eliminate the instability in some cases , as for example when the modulation periods are relatively small .",
    "however , to access the physically relevant modulation periods ( @xmath36 in gaas ) , an extremely small value of @xmath35 would have to be used , which results in an unacceptably slow rate of convergence .",
    "this problem can be overcome by means of a second strategy in which the long - range nature of the coulomb potential is effectively screened .",
    "the screening is conveniently formulated in fourier space using the algorithm    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the 2d fourier transforms of the electrostatic potential and 2d electron density , respectively , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is an artificial screening parameter .",
    "one can check that the first term on the right hand side of ( [ screenedpot ] ) , in which the density acts as a source , leads to an exponentially decaying potential in real space . nevertheless , at self - consistency , @xmath42 , which is just the fourier transform of the actual coulomb potential @xmath43 .",
    "by choosing @xmath41 of order unity , we were able to obtain convergence in all cases of interest with @xmath44 .",
    "although these values of @xmath35 are still rather small , they provided a rate of convergence which was significantly better than that achieved with the algebraic mixing scheme alone .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a range of potential modulation amplitudes .",
    "it is useful to represent these amplitudes in the dimensionless form @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the fermi energy of the uniform 2deg and the fermi wavevector @xmath47 is defined by @xmath48 . with an application to gaas in mind ,",
    "typical densities are in the range @xmath49@xmath50 . using the effective mass @xmath51 and static dielectric constant @xmath52 of gaas ,",
    "the atomic unit of length is the effective bohr radius @xmath53 , and the unit of energy is the effective rydberg @xmath54 mev .",
    "in these units , a density of @xmath55 is approximately @xmath56 ; this is the value of the average density used to generate the density distributions in fig .",
    "the equilibrium densities in this figure span the range from weak to moderate to strong modulation , and illustrate the way in which the cell - boundary density decreases with increasing values of @xmath57 . in the extreme localized limit ,",
    "the system consists of isolated quantum wires , each of which is confined within an approximately harmonic potential well of curvature @xmath58 .",
    "it can be seen that the density in this limit is similar to the semi - circular profile found in the classical electrostatic approximation@xcite , and only deviates significantly from this form at the edges of the quantum wire as a result of the quantum mechanical barrier penetration included within the tfdw approximation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we have constructed a ` phase ' diagram in the @xmath59@xmath60 plane which marks the boundary between localized and delocalized solutions of eq .",

    "we have used the criterion @xmath61 .",
    "this condition is rather arbitrary , and a value somewhat greater than or less than @xmath62 could have been used to generate a similar set of curves .",
    "the solid and dashed curves correspond to average 2d densities of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively and span the range of densities of physical interest .",

    ", one can show from eq .",
    "( [ veff ] ) that the scaled wavefunction @xmath65 as a function of the scaled length @xmath66 depends on the density only through the two parameters @xmath67 and @xmath45 . as a result ,",
    "the phase boundary in the @xmath59@xmath60 plane is a universal curve which is valid for any density .",
    "it can be seen that this scaling property of the wavefunction does not apply once interactions are included .",
    "we have also indicated by the labeled points the values of the parameters corresponding to three of the density profiles in fig .",
    "these were obtained for a density of @xmath63 , so that the position of the points relative to the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is relevant ; point ",
    "( b ) \" is associated with a strongly modulated but extended density while point  ( c ) \" is well into the localized region .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 can be used to distinguish two regimes of interest : the rapidly varying regime @xmath69 where the modulation period is small compared to the fermi wavelength of the average density , and the slowly varying regime @xmath70 . in the former limit , all of the curves approach an asymptote which is weakly dependent on density .",
    "this limit of strong quantum confinement can be understood simply in terms of the criterion that the potential barrier height , @xmath57 , is large compared to the quantum mechanical zero point energy @xmath71 .",
    "we thus conclude that the ` phase ' boundary is given approximately by @xmath72 , which is consistent with the numerical calculations . in this limit ,",
    "the quantum kinetic energy is deciding the question of localization . in the opposite limit of a slowly varying potential ( @xmath73 ) ,",
    "the von weizscker kinetic energy becomes negligible and we recover the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation .",
    "the experimental situations of interest are typically in this tf limit .",
    "the ` phase ' boundary now approaches a straight line with zero slope in the noninteracting case ( open circles ) and finite slope in the interacting case ( solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "the behavior of the noninteracting curve follows from the tf density , @xmath74 , and our criterion for localization implies @xmath75 , which is to be expected when the energy of the gas is exclusively kinetic . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of the interacting ` phase ' boundaries can be understood in electrostatic terms .",
    "the external potential @xmath19 can be viewed as arising from a modulation of the external positive background density about the average value @xmath29 : the amplitude of this density modulation , @xmath76 , is related to @xmath57 by @xmath77 . since the electrons simply neutralize the positive background locally in the tf limit , the criterion for localization becomes @xmath78 , which implies @xmath79 .",

    "this implies that the gap at the zone boundary first decreases to zero as a function of @xmath235 , and then increases again .",
    "such a crossing is possible since the two modes in question have different symmetries . to illustrate this more clearly",
    ", we show the induced charge density fluctuations for various modes in fig .",
    "the left panel of this figure corresponds to @xmath243 while the right panel is for @xmath244 .",
    "the sequence from top to bottom illustrates the five lowest modes , starting with the @xmath233 mode in the top panel , followed by the two @xmath222 modes in the middle panel and finally the next pair of @xmath233 modes in the bottom panel .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows how these mode densities change when @xmath235 is increased to @xmath245 .",
    "it is the pair of @xmath222 modes in the middle panel which exhibits the frequency crossing in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for @xmath235 values",
    "up to the crossing point , the lower frequency mode ( the  2 - 8 \" branch ) is symmetric with respect to reflections about @xmath246 , while the next highest mode ( the  3 - 7 \" branch ) is antisymmetric .",
    "the ordering in frequency of these two modes is then reversed at the crossing point , with the odd - parity mode lying lower .",
    "similar behaviour was found for the model densities with weak modulation considered in ref .",
    "[ ] , but for strong modulation an anticrossing behaviour was observed .",
    "as we shall see , the crossing behaviour we find persists for even stronger modulations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "a further examination of fig .  [ fig5 ] shows the odd - parity mode at @xmath222 approaching the lowest ",
    "lying @xmath233 mode with increasing @xmath235 ( points  6 \" and  7 \" ) .",
    "the reason for this can be explained by comparing the mode density (  6 \" ) in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] with the odd - parity density (  7 \" ) in the middle - right panel .",
    "both mode densities are seen to be localized at the cell boundaries where the equilibrium density is lowest , and both have a very similar spatial profile in this region .",
    "the near degeneracy of these modes for large @xmath235 indicates that there is a weak interaction between the density fluctuations localized at adjacent cell boundaries and that as a result , these modes effectively propagate independently of each other .",
    "this behaviour is analogous to the situation in a metallic slab where the symmetric and antisymmetric surface plasmons become degenerate at large wave vectors .",
    "the localization of the mode density at the cell boundaries increases with increasing @xmath235 , implying that the modes are channeled in their propagation along the low density part of the gas .",
    "we also see a similar convergence of the other @xmath222 mode with the next higher @xmath233 mode at large @xmath235 .",
    "the explanation for this is the same as given above . the density fluctuation  8 \" shown by the solid line in the right - middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is the even - parity version of the odd - parity density fluctuation  9 \" shown by the dashed curve in the lower - right panel . a similar pairing of @xmath233 and @xmath222 modes",
    "would also be expected for the higher lying modes in fig .",
    "this behaviour is in fact more evident when the modulation amplitude of the equilibrium density increases ( see figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "we should emphasize that the convergence of pairs of @xmath233 and @xmath222 mode frequencies implies that these modes exhibit a very weak dispersion with respect to @xmath84 .",
    "the absence of an effect of the @xmath247 phase modulation from one unit cell to the next reflects the lack of interaction between adjacent density fluctuations .",
    "returning to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we see that the gaps at the zone center are unobservably small for this case of weak modulation",
    ". however , each of the higher lying modes at @xmath233 corresponds to two distinct modes .",

    "one mode has even parity with respect to the center of the cell , and the other has odd parity .",
    "the latter mode eventually evolves with increasing modulation into the lowest odd - parity mode of an isolated wire .",
    "since this mode has a finite dipole moment , it will couple to an external radiation field and will contribute to the power absorption as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ altexp ] ) . to illustrate this , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the calculated power absorption for different modulations of the 2deg .",
    "the lowest curve labeled `` ( a ) '' corresponds to the case of weak modulation being considered here and shows a small peak at the frequency of the first excited @xmath233 mode  4 \" .",
    "this is essentially a bulk 2d plasmon at a wavevector @xmath249 . in principle",
    ", other @xmath233 odd - parity modes should be observable , but their oscillator strengths are too small to show up in the power absorption .",
    "in fact , the dominant feature in the power absorption of curve  ( a ) \" is the strong drude peak at @xmath204 which is to be expected since the system is only weakly perturbed from a homogeneous 2deg .",
    "we shall return to a more systematic discussion of the power absorption later .",
    "as the modulation is increased , the equilibrium density profile becomes more localized ( see the curve labeled by `` ( b ) '' in fig .",

    "the effect of this increased modulation on the wavevector dispersion along the @xmath20-direction is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . a comparison of this figure with fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] reveals several notable changes , the most dramatic being the increase in the magnitude of the gaps at both the zone center and zone boundary . as we have already discussed in sec .",
    "[ weak ] , the size of the gap is related to the magnitude of the density fourier coefficients , so this result is to be expected .",
    "we also notice that the @xmath84-dispersion of the lowest branch is much flatter than for the uniform gas .",
    "the explanation for this behaviour is once again found in appendix b where we show that the long - wavelength frequency of plasmons propagating in the @xmath20 direction is given by @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is the effective band mass at the zone center .",

    "the dispersion of the plasmon band as a function of @xmath84 is weak since the frequencies at @xmath233 and @xmath222 are coincidentally equal . as for the case of weak modulation",
    ", we also see the lowest pair of @xmath222 modes ( branches  2 - 8 \" and  3 - 7 \" ) crossing , implying that the lowest zone boundary gap closes at some finite value of @xmath235 .",
    "this again is possible due to the different parities of these modes (  2 \" and  3 \" ) in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . the same behaviour is now seen for the next pair of @xmath222 modes which also have opposite parity .",

    "this change in behaviour is associated with the crossing of the pair of @xmath222 branches  2 - 8 \" and  3 - 7 \" .",

    "there is an additional weak peak at @xmath255 a.u .",
    "corresponding to the next odd - parity mode at the zone center .",
    "it is clear that increasing the modulation has led to a decrease in the amplitude of the drude peak at @xmath204 and a transfer of oscillator strength to the other zone center modes .",
