    "excitonic optical absorption in strongly disordered semiconductor alloys has been of great interest to both semiconductor physics and technological applications of semiconductors and semiconductor structures in the past .",
    "although the theory of an optically excited electron - hole pair scattered or bound under the influence of the mutual coulomb interaction into an exciton is quite well understood in weakly disordered systems and even at finite carrier densities in the respective conduction and valence bands , theories for strongly disordered systems such as alloys of insulators and some semiconductors are still very incomplete .",
    "one of the few theories of disorder which interpolates correctly between all regimes of disorder strengths and concentrations is the coherent potential approximation cpa first developed by soven @xcite and taylor @xcite and subsequently extended to a proper two particle theory by velicky @xcite .",
    "the cpa predicts correctly the occurrence of split - off impurity bound states and whole impurity bands , once the relative disorder strength becomes of the order of the width of the unperturbed single particle density of states considered . despite the numerous advantages that the cpa provides , it has proved difficult to incorporate a treatment of a carrier - carrier interaction into its framework and to our knowledge the only attempt to find a joint treatment of both effects has been made by kanehisa and elliott @xcite who introduced a random phase like decoupling of the disorder average in the corresponding perturbation expansion in combination with a contact potential model for the coulomb interaction .",
    "although this description produces a number of correct features in a limit of low disorder , it could not be extrapolated successfully to the case where the disorder becomes stronger , i.e. when the joint density of states splits into two components and the excitons move to a more localized frenkel limit , where a separate approach is needed . no theory has been available for the region of intermediate disorder strengths where the bands are about to split .    an improved treatment of this problem has become possible through the development of a properly weighted two particle cpa in a previous paper @xcite which allows to distinguish between different site types involved in the propagation of two particles during an absorption process .",
    "we will show that differentiating between alloy components in a perturbation expansion with an appropriate decoupling procedure of the disorder average can yield the correct interpolation to all ranges of disorder for a contact potential model .",
    "furthermore , this allows us to distinguish different contact interaction strengths between the carriers if these meet on different types of sites , whereby these strengths are modeled to represent the electron - hole interaction within an atomic radius .",

    "our two - band model hamiltonian without carrier - carrier interactions can thus be written in a site representation as @xmath5 where the @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the annihilation operators for an electron and a hole on the site @xmath8 , respectively .",

    "the particular kind of two particle function needed in this case is determined by the form of the dipole operators which account for the interaction of the electronic excitation with the radiation field and which in the case of allowed interband transitions @xcite effectively couple the two single particle resolvents in the respective bands : @xmath28 the total optical polarizability in a matsubara representation which we adopt for convenience can be written as @xmath29 where the angular brackets denote the configurational average , @xmath30 is the usual inverse temperature and @xmath31 denotes the trace over the band @xmath32 as in ref . @xmath33 here it is assumed that the dipole matrix elements are taken for the transition from a valence band of @xmath34-wave symmetry to a conduction band of @xmath35-wave symmetry in which case they can be assumed to be essentially constant and we normalize them to unity .",
    "this implies that for the calculation of a properly averaged polarizability which is void of any further interactions we need to consider the following two particle function @xmath36 apart from the cumulative function @xmath37 stated above it is now also possible to consider its weighted components by using the appropriately weighted versions of the single particle functions in their definitions .",

    "introducing @xmath46 we find that @xmath47 these functions can now readily be used to obtain corresponding components of the polarizability which are calculated the same way as in ( [ mb2 ] ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote possible weights @xmath51 .",
    "functions of this type have been discussed analytically and numerically in ref . for various regimes of disorder .",
    "the inclusion of a carrier - carrier interaction into a model for the optical polarizability is essential for the treatment of exciton effects .",
    "however , an analytic treatment of this problem in strongly disordered systems such as alloys of insulators and of semiconductors using the true or screened coulomb interaction seems to be almost impossible .",
    "this is due to the fact that the corresponding bethe - salpeter equation @xmath52 is extremely hard to decouple . here",
    "@xmath53 is the coulomb interaction in the site representation with its direct and exchange part and @xmath54 is the non - interacting configuration dependent two particle function @xmath55 the exactly averaged polarizability including exciton effects is calculated from the interacting version of this function ( [ ea1 ] ) as @xmath56 the main difficulty in solving equation ( [ ea1 ] ) arises from the fact that the disorder average over the second term creates higher order correlations in the particle motion than those which are accounted for by the inclusion of the vertex corrections .",
    "these additional average induced correlations lead to an effective coulomb interaction which is renormalized in a very complicated fashion .",
    "for these reasons two drastic simplifications have been made in earlier treatments of the problem .",
    "first the coulomb interaction is replaced by a short range contact potential which binds at most one state in a joint band limit when the disorder is relatively weak .",
    "this state is meant to represent the 1-@xmath35 exciton from the coulomb series which usually dominates the optical absorption spectrum below the continuum absorption edge .",
    "secondly the disorder average in ( [ ea1 ] ) is decoupled into a product of averages .",
    "the average polarizability including this carrier - carrier interaction is then obtained as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the uniform strength of the contact potential and the average was replaced through a horizontal bar over corresponding quantities .",
    "however , this type of decoupling of the average becomes reasonable only in the limit of weak disorder , when the electron - hole pair experiences many impurities before its constituents are coulomb scattered ( wannier excitons ) .",
    "effectively , therefore no higher than two particle correlations can be accounted for within this approximation and it will be shown that for stronger disorder even these correlations are significantly misweighted and overcounted .",
    "it hence must clearly fail in a regime of strong disorder where excitons may be primarily associated with two separate impurity bands .    for the strong disorder limit",
    "it is shown explicitly in ref .",
    "how the solution for the two particle function is modified towards a regime of localized excitations ( frenkel excitons ) , which is equivalent to letting the overlap of the atomic wavefunctions go to zero , while at the same time the disorder strengths are kept constant .",
    "if ( [ ea1 ] ) is considered before averaging in this limit , it goes over to @xmath59{\\cal k}(i \\omega;ii , kk ) = \\delta_{ik } \\pi_0(i \\omega;i ) + \\pi_0(i \\omega;i ) \\sum_j w(i - j){\\cal k}(i \\omega;jj , kk ) \\label{ea3},\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the atomic polarizability on the site @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the exchange part of the coulomb interaction which is now entirely responsible for electron transfer from one atom to another .",
    "it is this term which makes an exact solution of equation ( [ ea3 ] ) still difficult .",
    "if now a the exchange @xmath63 is assumed to go to zero as well we obtain the limit of isolated atoms .",

    "since the present limit corresponds to letting the bandwith of the components of the joint density of states go to zero , given some arbitrary strength of disorder , the same limiting behavior of the polarizability can be attained @xcite by letting the disorder strengths become much larger than the band width which yields two energetically separated contributions to the joint dos and the formal properties of ( [ ea5 ] ) are recovered .",
    "the appearance of ( [ ea5 ] ) suggests that one should also allow for the possibility of using two different contact interaction strengths on different types of sites thus allowing for different types of atomic screening in different alloy components .",
    "it is clear that equation ( [ ea5 ] ) is not obtained by the extrapolation to a strong disorder limit from equation ( [ ea2_2 ] ) and so far there had been no indication as to what type of approximation one should use in the description of an intermediate disorder regime , where the strengths of the disorder @xmath67 are of the order of the corresponding half - widths of the single particle bands @xmath68 , which at the same time extrapolates correctly to the asymptotic behavior predicted by equations ( [ ea2_2 ] ) and ( [ ea5 ] ) for weak and strong disorder , respectively .      based on our results in ref .",
    "we employ in the following a component weighted scattering expansion to obtain the excitonic polarizability , while at the same time we allow the contact potential strengths to assume different values on different types of sites .",
    "we use a similar decoupling of the disorder averages to obtain a new approximation for the scattering in an intermediate disorder regime .",
    "subsequently , we show that this approximation renders exactly the interpolation behavior that we had hoped to achieve .",
    "we introduce the following attractive weighted contact scattering interaction strengths @xmath69 associated with the @xmath13 and @xmath2-components of the medium , whereby @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent bare scattering strengths , and the limit of uniform interaction strengths corresponds to @xmath72 .",

    "it is well known @xcite that in this limit the cpa self energy goes over to the virtual crystal limit @xmath81 and the vertex correction to @xmath82 .",

    "in this section we discuss a numerical implementation of our previous results within a commonly used model in three dimensional systems .",
    "since within the quasi - ata contact potential model of the electron - hole interaction the excitonic polarizability can be obtained directly by inserting the weighted components of the average polarizability for the free particle system into equation ( [ eb4 ] ) , we draw strongly from the results obtained for the non - interacting system in ref . .",

    "for amalgamation type solid solutions , i.e. alloys whose densities of states of the pure @xmath13 and @xmath2-substances overlap to a great extent in the respective conduction and valence bands , cpa results already exist @xcite for the case @xmath144 .",
    "we shall therefore focus on the region of parameters which corresponds to intermediate disorder , where our approximation provides significantly better results than earlier approaches .",

    "in determining the region of interest we note that , as pointed out by many workers ( cf . for example the review article by rashba @xcite ) , the cpa produces a `` pseudo '' gap in the single particle dos at all concentrations once the disorder strengths exceed the half - width of the single particle bands involved , @xmath148 , and also translates to the joint dos in some regimes . in more realistic systems , however , usually a true gap only exists once the disorder strengths exceed the full band widths @xmath149 , even though in the regime @xmath150 the number of states in the region of the pseudo gap is strongly suppressed .",

    "note that in all the figures for the non - interacting polarizability only the single @xmath160-function has been plotted and the components of the spectra sum as @xmath161 and @xmath162 .    in the case of parallel disorder of fig .",

    "in addition , since it is difficult to find a view - angle of the resulting plots which shows all features of the spectra simultaneously , we have cut off the resonance peaks at an appropriate value and overlayed a contour representation of the spectra which renders more detailed information about the position and the width of the excitonic resonances as the interaction strengths are increased .",

    "this implies that it is possible to have a very sharp resonance of the exciton peak associated with the higher lying component of the joint dos deep within the region where the dos is relatively large , but almost entirely consists of the opposite component . on the other hand",
    "the resonance can be very broad even in a region where the cumulative dos is practically zero , due to the presence of finite double weighted components which mutually cancel out to a great extent , once they are summed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) the set of spectra commences with the completely unperturbed joint dos for parallel disorder in fig .",
    "the a - exciton which is being pulled out at the lower end of the central bulk part , which consists almost entirely of @xmath163 and @xmath164-components , becomes very sharp as soon as it leaves the pure a - component at about @xmath173 corresponding to an @xmath1-interaction strength @xmath174 . beyond this value",
    "almost the entire oscillator strength of the @xmath1-component is found in the resonance and thus only the pure @xmath2-contribution remains in the central part as @xmath70 is increased further .",
    "it should be noted that these resonances show a finite width also when they are exterior of any of the dos contributions due to a small artificial imaginary part of about @xmath175 units which has been added to the energy in order to ensure the correct analyticity of the quantities involved at the given numerical accuracy .",
    "a major broadening occurs subsequently as the resonance crosses the lower @xmath160-region which sharpens again once it has passed its lower end .",
    "the overlayed contour plot suggests that in the region without almost any @xmath176-states , the increase of the excitonic binding energy is throughout linear with the increase to the interaction strength @xmath70 .",
    "however , as the bound state passes through the the lower split off flank , which is constituted of about @xmath177 @xmath165 and @xmath178 @xmath163 and @xmath164-components , respectively , ",
    "see @xmath179 enlarged region in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b )  it gets broadened and the propagation path of the bound state seems to attain a parallel shift ( of about @xmath180 ) with respect to the initial one , corresponding to a constant addition to the binding energy beyond the lowest flank of the spectrum .",
    "this additional deepening of binding is found through all stacks of spectra for parallel and anti - parallel disorder equally .",
    "it can be observed throughout fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b)(d ) that as the @xmath1-resonance passes the lower @xmath160-flank most of the states from this region are being absorbed into the resonances while the same is true for the the upper @xmath160-flank of the spectrum which feels the effect from afar . a very similar behavior is observed as @xmath71 is increased over the series of stacked plots and the last bits of the upper flank get absorbed in this process .",
    "passing through the lower @xmath160-flank also gives a strong broadening which accounts for the persistence of @xmath2-states which are not influenced by the @xmath1-interaction .",
    "the plots also show that the formation of excitonic states associated with either of the underlying components of the alloy is largely independent of correlations between the two interaction strengths @xmath70 and @xmath71 , i.e. the formation of bound states associated with one of the two material components is seen to be as good as unaffected by a variation of interaction strength associated with the complementary component .",
    "the only slight correlation which comes into play is via the mixed @xmath160-components to which both @xmath70 and @xmath71 couple weakly .",
    "it can be observed that as the resonance associated with the higher lying component passes through the shifted body of the lower lying one , both this resonance and the peak width of the absorption edge narrow in the case of parallel disorder figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b)(d ) and broaden in the case of anti - parallel disorder figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( b)(d ) .    figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a)(d ) for anti - parallel disorder exhibit many similar properties to the ones for the parallel case , but they also display quite a few novel features .",
    "the @xmath1-resonance is strongly broadened as it is pulled into the center of the gap , which the non - interacting absorption for this case from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) exhibits .",
    "this broadening stems from the @xmath163 and @xmath164-components which still prevail in this region and which are compensated by the @xmath160-gain contribution  see @xmath181 enlarged region of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) .",
    "it is very curious to observe however , that even after the resonance has passed to lower energies , there is a finite hump remaining in the gap center which is subsequently bleached as the @xmath2-resonance also shifts downwards .",
    "the development of this hump can be followed through figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a)(d ) if one looks through the trough that the @xmath1-resonance forms in the central region of the gap onto the residual spectrum visible at the back .",
    "it mainly consists of @xmath164-states which remain in this region whereas both the @xmath163 and @xmath160-components become largely withdrawn .",
    "looking at the contour plots of this arrangement suggests that , in addition to the constant increase in binding of the @xmath2-resonance as @xmath71 increases , which is comparable in magnitude to the one observed for parallel disorder as the central @xmath160-region is passed , the constant of proportionality for the deepening seems to have increased corresponding to a faster linear deepening of the a - exciton binding with increasing @xmath70 .",
    "the spectra of figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a)(d ) are also particularly suitable to visualize that a weighted scattering expansion used in the context of an average decoupling and a contact potential model with two distinguishable interaction strengths renders a much more accurate prediction for the formation of the excitonic resonances than the unweighted one of equation ( [ ea2_2 ] ) . equation ( [ ea2_2 ] ) produces a resonance whenever re@xmath182 = - 1/u$ ] and im@xmath182 $ ] is small or zero . in a split band case as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the real part is seen to have a zero in the gap where im@xmath182 \\simeq 0 $ ] .",
    "this means that an increase of the interaction strength @xmath58 would lead to a bound state being trapped between the split bands at this zero of re@xmath182 $ ] in the limit @xmath183 .",
    "this behavior of course is clearly wrong , since one can expect that the binding energy of any occurring excitonic resonance deepens  in this case the binding energy of the resonance associated with the higher lying @xmath1-band  as the interaction strength increases .",
    "this failure in giving the right asymptotic description can be ascribed to a misweighting and overcounting even of scattering processes which contain two particle correlations only .",
    "our approximation overcomes this problem to a great extent and it is void of the erroneous trapping of the resonance , which as expected passes on to lower energies and finally appears below the @xmath2-band as @xmath70 is increased , independently of the value of @xmath71 .    the variation range of the carrier interaction strengths  particularly the one for @xmath70  which we have plotted throughout figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] is very large and is unlikely to be found in semiconductor alloys .",
    "however , mixtures of molecular crystals which form extremely narrow bands and at the same time have rather strong band offsets might be candidates for such behavior .",
    "much earlier work on excitons in strongly disordered binary solid solutions at finite concentrations focussed on systems where the exciton is tightly bound with a binding energy greater that the narrow band width . in this case",
    "the frenkel exciton has been frequently described by a `` single '' particle green s function based on the theory of molecular excitons by davydov@xcite .",
    "one of the standard assumptions within this framework , which is based on the davydov theory , is that the matrix elements in the optical absorption , @xmath184 are strongly localized in momentum space , i.e. @xmath185 which means that the contributing transitions are not only required to be vertical due to the approximate absence of total momentum of the exciting photon but also to only occur at one single point in the bands at @xmath186 ( davydov component ) , due to the momentum of the relative electron - hole motion being approximated to zero .",
    "early treatments of the absorption of mixed molecular crystals employed the average amplitude approximation ( aaa ) first introduced by broude and rashba @xcite , which is able to roughly predict the position and gravity center strengths of the dominant transitions only . with the introduction of the cpa which has some important advantages over the aaa , such as being able to produce an approximation of the actual shape of the joint dos , it became possible to implement the davydov theory within a self consistent framework .",
    "this has been pursued by onodera and toyozawa @xcite and a little later by hong and robinson @xcite who tried to model their results particularly on observations made in experiments @xcite on naphtalene and anthracene .",
    "the approach of all these authors , despite its self consistency , results in serious restrictions to the predictions their model can render about aspects of genuine two particle behavior and it contains no explicit mention of an electron - hole interaction .",
    "it seems to give reasonable predictions on some of the features of frenkel excitons in the strongly insulating substances as investigated in references @xcite , where the calculated positions of the davydov components are compared with the ones of the experimentally observed peaks in the absorption spectra .",
    "a significant disadvantage of this single particle exciton theory is that only one `` joint density of states '' bandwidth and disorder strength can be considered , rather than two independent values for both of these parameters , associated with the underlying conduction and valence bands . a behavior of the joint density of states as displayed for parallel conduction - valence band disorder which can lead to the filling of the central part of the joint dos by the states arising from the @xmath163 and @xmath164-transitions even in a split band limit , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , could for example never be obtained in such a simple single particle picture .",
    "additionally , the binding energy of the excitons does not relate to any electron - hole interaction , which in a real system determines their relative position with respect to the continuum absorption edge .",
    "the first work which is based on the footing of a proper two particle theory known to us is by abe and toyozawa @xcite who employed velick s two particle cpa@xcite to calculate the absorption in a non - interacting system with gaussian disorder .",
    "kanehisa and elliott @xcite thereafter seem to be the first authors to consider both a two particle cpa for the disorder and a contact interaction as a model for an electron - hole interaction , but they were only able to obtain an asymptotic solution in the regime of weak disorder , using the average decoupling of the unweighted polarizability in ( [ ea2_2 ] ) .",
    "as they pointed out , their results can be regarded as applying to the amalgamation regime and a comparison was made with experiments on iii - v alloys .",
    "one should note that the approaches of refs . and",
    "the present work make the assumption that the optical matrix elements are constant over the single particle bands involved , even though only vertical transitions at @xmath187 are allowed , which is contrasting the davydov theory used in the earlier theoretical models of refs .",
    ", where only the zero momentum component @xmath188 is taken . in a more realistic situation , the appropriate matrix elements will exhibit a more general @xmath189-dependence , but it does not present any conceptual difficulty to modify our present results to model such cases as well , once the actual dispersion laws for the conduction and valence bands are known .",
    "the present work is the most extensive to date which treats the correlated motion of pairs of interacting particles in a disordered medium .",
    "it draws from the extension of the cpa to two particle propagation developed by velick @xcite and its extension to weighted two particle green s functions given in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the model introduced here achieves a better but still approximate treatment of the interference between the effects of impurity scattering and direct two particle ( electron - hole ) interaction and it provides an interpolation scheme through all strengths of disorder as well as the possibility to include site dependent variations in the direct electron - hole interaction within an ata - like framework .",
    "it is therefore most appropriate for systems where the disorder causes a small but distinct band splitting , where previous asymptotic models fail to work .",
    "there are many disordered systems where such interacting pairs of particles play an important physical role and we believe the method can be extended to such situations . modeling the excitonic absorption provides a particularly obvious and parmount application .",
