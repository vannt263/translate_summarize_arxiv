    "in newtonian gravity , the poisson equation is a linear relation between the gravitational potential and the matter overdensity . by contrast , in general relativity ( gr ) this",
    "is replaced by a nonlinear relation , which introduces mode coupling between large and small scales  @xcite .",
    "the original result has been confirmed by a number of independent calculations  @xcite .",
    "similar mode coupling can be produced in newtonian gravity by local - type primordial non - gaussianity of the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "the gr effect has therefore previously been interpreted as an effective local non - gaussianity on very large scales   @xcite .    recently",
    "two papers have argued that a `` separate universe '' approach can be used to show that _ no _ scale - dependent bias arises from the gr corrections on large scales @xcite .",
    "the argument is that the nonlinear coupling between long - wavelength perturbations on a scale @xmath0 , and the small - scale variance , @xmath1 , on a scale @xmath2 , vanishes under a local coordinate rescaling and hence is unobservable .    the separate universe approach @xcite has proved to be a powerful tool to understand the origin of large - scale structure , and primordial non - gaussianity , from inflation .",
    "accelerated expansion in the very early universe stretches initial small - scale vacuum fluctuations up to scales much larger than the hubble scale at the end of inflation .",
    "spatial gradients for such long - wavelength modes become small relative to the local hubble time , and for many scales of interest , the perturbed universe can be treated as a patchwork of `` separate universes '' , each locally obeying the classical friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) evolution of an unperturbed universe .",
    "the separate universe approach is particularly useful for studying nonlinear perturbations on large scales @xcite . for adiabatic perturbations",
    ", each separate universe patch follows locally the same evolution as the unperturbed `` background '' cosmology .",
    "the only difference between separate patches is the local expansion , characterised by the comoving metric perturbation @xmath3 .",
    "this is defined to be the local perturbation of the integrated expansion rate with respect to a background flat reference cosmology , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "an important consequence of the uniqueness of the local evolution for adiabatic perturbations is that @xmath3 is conserved on large scales where the separate universe approach is valid @xcite .    in each patch , the comoving spatial line element is ( see @xcite ) [ met ] ds_(3)^2 = e^2 _ ij dx^i dx^j .",
    "there is a global _ background _ which must be defined with respect to some scale @xmath6 , at least as large as all the other scales of interest , i.e. , at least as large as our presently observable universe .",
    "it is important to distinguish this from the scale of the separate universe patches , @xmath7 .",
    "this is large enough for each patch to be treated as locally homogeneous and isotropic , but patches must be stitched together to describe the long - wavelength perturbations on a scale @xmath8 .",
    "thus , following @xcite , we require a hierarchy of scales ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : [ scales ] _ 0 > _ l _ p _ s.    the local observer in a separate universe patch can not observe the effect of @xmath9 , which is locally homogeneous on the patch scale @xmath7 .",
    "however , local coordinates can be defined only locally and the long mode curvature perturbation is observable through a mapping from local to global coordinates .",
    "in newtonian gravity the only constraint on initial conditions is the poisson equation , which provides a linear relation between the overdensity and the gravitational potential at all orders [ poisson ] ^2 _ n = - a^2h^2 .",
    "thus if the initial newtonian potential @xmath10 is gaussian , then so is the initial density field @xmath11 . in gr ,",
    "the nonlinear energy constraint equation for irrotational dust is  @xcite 23 ^ 2 - 2 ^ 2 + r^(3 ) = 16g+ 2 , where @xmath12 is the comoving matter density , @xmath13 is the cosmological constant , @xmath14 is the expansion rate of the matter 4-velocity , @xmath15 is its shear , and @xmath16 is the ricci curvature scalar of the 3-dimensional space orthogonal to @xmath17 . at first order in perturbations about an flrw cosmology , the energy constraint combines with the momentum constraint to give the relativistic version of the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) , where @xmath10 is replaced by @xmath18 , i.e. the spatial metric perturbation in longitudinal gauge , and @xmath11 is the synchronous comoving gauge density contrast . note that @xmath19 at first order . at second order , at the start of the matter era , using the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath3 , we obtain @xcite [ gr2 ] ^2 - 2 ^ 2 + 12 ( ) ^2 = - a^2h^2 .    consider a gaussian distribution of @xmath3 .",
    "we separate @xmath3 and @xmath11 into independent long- and short - wavelength modes , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where the wavelength of the long modes @xmath0 obeys ; in particular , @xmath8 . to leading order in @xmath22 and @xmath9 , and neglecting gradients of @xmath9 relative to those of @xmath22 ,",
    "the initial constraint ( [ gr2 ] ) implies @xmath23 and @xmath24 the second term on the left represents the long - short mode coupling .    within a local patch on a scale @xmath7 ,",
    "it is possible to redefine the background spatial coordinates to absorb the effects of the long - wavelength perturbations @xmath25 , following @xcite : @xmath26 if we neglect gradients of the long mode , this transformation eliminates @xmath25 from the spatial metric @xmath27 this transformation holds for each _ single _ patch ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "since this is a purely spatial coordinate transformation , the curvature and density perturbations transform as scalars , @xmath28x\\,.\\ ] ] the constraint equation ( [ longshort ] ) becomes @xmath29 thus in the new local coordinates , in one patch of size @xmath7 , we have a linear poisson equation and the long - short mode coupling appears to be absent .",
    "this confirms the fact that the local observer in a separate universe patch can not observe the effect of the locally homogeneous perturbation @xmath9 , as argued in  @xcite .",
    "the original coordinates @xmath30 define a global chart , which is essential for defining random fields such as @xmath9 on large scales , and the long mode curvature perturbation enters through the mapping from local to global coordinates .",
    "indeed , a coordinate transformation that depends on a random field is not a new concept in large - scale structure .",
    "the situation here is reminiscent of the redshift - space distortion map , where the random field is given by the peculiar velocities ( which are in turn generated by large - scale density perturbations ) . because of the nonlinear nature of this map , an initially gaussian field in real space becomes non - gaussian in redshift space @xcite .    as shown in @xcite , @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "are gaussian fields with respect to the local coordinates @xmath33 . by ,",
    "@xmath34 and so we recover a non - gaussian distribution for the density field with respect to the global coordinates , @xmath30 .",
    "see fig .  2 for a schematic illustration of this .",
    "there is no argument against the fact that @xmath33 coordinates are useful to discuss physics in a local patch of size @xmath35  but this applies only locally .",
    "the effect of the long mode @xmath25 is to create spatial curvature @xmath36 on a constant - time hypersurface .",
    "the curvature can be eliminated only locally , by neglecting gradients of @xmath9 , as in . beyond the single patch , when gradients are not negligible , we have @xcite @xmath37 \\,.\\ ] ]    indeed ,",
    "all coordinate transformations that neglect curvature can only be defined locally ( see @xcite ) . the spatial curvature generated by @xmath25",
    "is directly related to the long - wavelength density perturbation @xmath38 by the long - wavelength part of . on a constant - time hypersurface ,",
    "the density perturbation can not be eliminated by the spatial coordinate transformation .",
    "this implies that we need many different local patches of scale @xmath39 described by different @xmath33-coordinates in the entire observed universe of scale @xmath40 .    within a single patch on a scale @xmath7",
    ", the local observer does not notice this stochastic nature of the local coordinates .",
    "however , once we are interested in physics beyond the local patch we have to compare the different patches and we notice that @xmath33 vary stochastically through their dependence on @xmath25 .",
    "this implies that gr non - gaussianity is present in the dark matter distribution .",
    "nonlinear gr effects can be appreciated only by looking at a region where @xmath41 is not negligible and , in principle , the stochastic nature of @xmath9 could become apparent .",
    "in newtonian gravity , it is standard to parametrise primordial non - gaussianity of local type in the newtonian potential by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a gaussian random field .",
    "if we split the gaussian field into long and short modes , @xmath44 , and use the same assumptions that lead to , then the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) yields [ fnlpoisson ] ( 1 + 2 f_nl _",
    "l ) ^2 _ s = - a^2h^2_s .",
    "this leads to a scale - dependent galaxy bias  @xcite .",
    "single - field , slow - roll inflation generates an almost gaussian distribution for @xmath3 , which remains gaussian for adiabatic perturbations on super - hubble scales through to the start of the matter - dominated era . for this gaussian case ,",
    "using the first - order relation @xmath45 , the gr second - order constraint equation ( [ longshort ] ) gives @xmath46 this has been used to argue that gr corrections to the comoving density field will also lead to a scale - dependent bias , with an effective ( local ) non - gaussianity parameter   @xcite : [ fgr2 ] f_nl^gr , eff=-53 .    while the newtonian potential @xmath10 satisfies the linear poisson equation at all orders , in gr @xmath3 obeys the nonlinear constraint ( [ gr2 ] ) .",
    "we could thus define primordial non - gaussianity of the comoving density field , e.g. , from inflation , in terms of the primordial metric perturbation , @xmath3 .",
    "local - type primordial non - gaussianity can be parametrised as thus , the non - gaussianity present in the comoving density field ( [ gr2 ] ) is similar to a newtonian density field with local - type non - gaussianity parameter however , as we shall show in the next section , this newtonian description of the density field in terms of an effective @xmath47 is _ not _ sufficient to describe local halo abundance in gr . when considering halos , smoothing of the dark matter field must be introduced .",
    "the variance of @xmath32 smoothed on a physical scale is not correlated with the large - scale modes @xmath9 , unlike the case with primordial non - gaussianity of local type .",
    "the presence of a large - scale perturbation can change the local abundance of collapsed dark matter halos either through a perturbation in the local  background \" density , @xmath38 , or through a perturbation in the local variance , @xmath48 , on a comoving scale @xmath49 , where we use a bar to denote quantities in the global background .    for a gaussian density field",
    "the small - scale variance is independent of the long - wavelength perturbations , but for a non - gaussian field of the local - type in newtonian gravity , as given in ( [ fnlpoisson ] ) , the small - scale variance is modulated by long - wavelength perturbations and we have _",
    "|r^2|__l = ( 1 + 4f_nl_l ) |_|r^2 . here",
    "@xmath50 is the variance of the density field smoothed on the comoving length scale @xmath51 , corresponding to a given physical mass in the global background , [ def : barm ] m = 43 |r^3 | .",
    "we have @xmath52 and hence local - type non - gaussianity can lead to a strongly scale - dependent bias for halos  @xcite .    in gr the long - wavelength metric perturbation , @xmath9 , also leads to a change in the variance at a fixed comoving radius , @xmath53 .",
    "the density perturbations obey the nonlinear constraint equation .",
    "this nonlinearity modulates the density field by @xmath9 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 refers to the density perturbations in the absence of @xmath9 while @xmath56 denotes that in the presence of @xmath9 . from ( [ longshort ] )",
    "we have [ sigrgivenzeta ] _",
    "r^2|__l = ( 1 - 4_l ) |_r^2 .",
    "however in gr we must also account for the perturbation in the mass enclosed within a comoving radius @xmath53 due to a long - wavelength metric perturbation @xmath9 : [ pertm ] m = 43 ( 1 + 3_l ) r^3 . to compare the local abundance of halos of a fixed physical mass , @xmath57 in ( [ def : barm ] ) , in the presence of a long - wavelength perturbation , @xmath9",
    ", we must compare properties of the density field on a fixed local _",
    "scale @xmath58 .",
    "hence [ rvsbarr ] r = ( 1-_l)|r .",
    "note that we neglect the perturbation in the density , @xmath12 , in ( [ pertm ] ) , since @xmath38 is negligible relative to @xmath59 for long - wavelength perturbations .    for a scale - invariant distribution of the curvature perturbation , @xmath3 , the variance of the density field at two different comoving scales @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    "are related by    equality horizon scale , @xmath62 . using ( [ rvsbarr ] ) , we obtain [ sigrvsbarr ] |_r^2 = ( 1 + 4_l ) |_|r^2 .    thus combining ( [ sigrgivenzeta ] ) and",
    "( [ sigrvsbarr ] ) , we obtain _",
    "r^2|__l = |_|r^2 .",
    "as shown in ( [ localpoisson1 ] ) , the small - scale density at a fixed _ local physical _ scale is independent of the long - wavelength perturbation .",
    "thus the long - wavelength mode has no effect on the small - scale variance of the density field smoothed on a fixed mass scale .",
    "although there is a change in the local variance at a fixed comoving coordinate radius , @xmath53 , this is exactly compensated by the change in the local coordinate scale corresponding to a fixed physical mass and the scale - dependence of the variance @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the argument that the long - wavelength perturbations @xmath63 are not observable locally if the distribution of the primordial metric perturbation , @xmath3 , is a gaussian random field @xcite .",
    "note that in newtonian gravity there is no equivalent perturbation in the physical volume and hence there is no perturbation in the mass enclosed at a coordinate radius @xmath53 caused by the large - scale potential @xmath59 .",
    "a newtonian description with @xmath64 thus fails to account for the local coordinate invariance inherent in gr .",
    "we have shown how non - gaussian correlations in the matter overdensity arise due to nonlinear constraints in gr , even when the primordial metric perturbation from inflation , @xmath65 , is described by a gaussian random field .",
    "this may be understood in a simple way as arising from the long - wavelength metric perturbation @xmath25 rescaling the local small - scale curvature perturbation @xmath66 , and thus the local small - scale density field , through the nonlinear constraint equation ( [ longshort ] ) .",
    "a very long wavelength metric perturbation can be removed locally by a coordinate transformation .",
    "if the long - wavelength perturbation were much larger than our observable horizon , @xmath67 , then that would be the end of the story  perturbations with wavelength much larger than our horizon form part of our background cosmology and can not be observed locally .",
    "however , local coordinates can be defined only locally and the long mode curvature perturbation enters through a mapping from local to global coordinates .",
    "this coordinate transformation depends on a random field and is reminiscent of the mapping between real and redshift space , where the large - scale random field is given by the velocity field .",
    "it is known that redshift space distortions induce non - gaussianity .",
    "the fact that the nonlinear gr effect is present in global coordinates , is similar to non - gaussianities in the cmb that arise at recombination due solely to the intrinsic nonlinearity of relativistic perturbations  @xcite .",
    "if the long - wavelength perturbations are on scales greater than the present horizon , they can not have any physical effect , and can be rescaled away ( this corresponds to properly redefining the background average temperature  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we are interested in modes that are inside the horizon today , and we need to compare different patches of the sky modulated by a long mode @xcite .",
    "this provides an alternative understanding of a gr term that was missing in  @xcite , compared to the expression for the squeezed cmb angular bispectrum obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the angular bispectrum of cmb temperature anisotropies ( and polarisation ) has been estimated  @xcite and shown to reproduce in this squeezed limit the full numerical calculations of the einstein - boltzmann system at second order  @xcite .",
    "this intrinsic non - gaussianity in the cmb , predicted by local rescaling arguments , could in principle be observed by future experiments .    on the other hand , to compute the local abundance of halos of a fixed physical mass",
    ", we have to introduce smoothing on a local physical scale @xmath68 and the corresponding local variance is independent of @xmath9 , as argued by  @xcite .",
    "thus the short - wavelength variance _ at a fixed physical mass scale _ is not modulated by the long - wavelength metric perturbation in gr .",
    "it is still an open question whether observable mass proxies such as luminosity , velocity dispersion , x - ray emission , sz decrement , or gravitational weak lensing signal , correspond directly to the fixed physical mass defined above .",
    "intrinsic non - gaussianity in the large - scale density field in gr is real and physical .",
    "it could leave observable signatures in the large - scale structure of the universe , provided we can find observable quantities that depend on global variables such as the distance between the observer and a distant patch .",
