    "the study of giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) at high temperature ( @xmath4 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath5 ) has been an interesting area of research which has revealed several structural properties of nuclei at extreme conditions .",
    "being a fundamental mode of photo excitation , gdr can probe nuclei at extreme conditions and even those with exotic structures @xcite . several earlier works on gdr focused on the high-@xmath5 regime @xcite whereas recent studies at extreme isospins have potential astrophysical implications @xcite .",
    "the gdr at low @xmath4 is also relatively less explored and its studies have gained acceleration in recent times @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it is very difficult to populate nuclei at low excitation energies , but it is still feasible due to recent developments in the experimental facilities .",
    "several properties of nuclei at low @xmath4 are still not clear : for example , the existence of pairing phase transition , the order of it if it exists , the role of fluctuations , etc .",
    "the low-@xmath4 region is quite intriguing because the microscopic effects such as shell ( quantal ) and pairing effects are quite active , although they are modified by thermal effects .",
    "since the nucleus is a tiny system , the thermal fluctuations inherent in finite systems are expected to be large .",
    "the shape degrees of freedom being crucial for nuclear structure , the deformation parameters are closely associated with the order parameters for the related transitions .",
    "hence the thermal shape fluctuations ( tsf ) are the most dominant ones , and at low @xmath4 the fluctuations in the pairing field can also contribute significantly .",
    "many models @xcite have been used to study the effect of both these fluctuations separately , but the combined effect of these two was not investigated until our recent efforts @xcite .",
    "various theoretical approaches have been introduced to investigate the gdr . in a macroscopic approach",
    ", gdr is a collective mode of excitation of nuclei caused by the out - of - phase oscillations between the proton and neutron fluids under the influence of the electromagnetic field induced by an emitted / absorbed photon .",
    "here , the gdr couples directly to the shape of the nucleus hence providing corresponding structure information .",
    "the thermal shape fluctuation model ( tsfm ) is based on such a macroscopic approach and explains the increase in gdr width with @xmath4 by taking in to account the average of gdr cross sections over the shape degrees of freedom .",
    "the tsfm is quite successful in interpreting several gdr measurements at high @xmath4 and @xmath5 and hence is often used by experimentalists as theoretical support for their data .    in an alternative approach",
    ", the gdr observables can be calculated utilizing a linear response theory incorporating the tsf within the static path approximation @xcite .",
    "other rigorous microscopic approaches exist @xcite but are mostly limited to the study of low - lying states . in microscopic approaches , such as the phonon - damping model ( pdm ) , gdr damping is explained through coupling of the gdr phonon to particle - hole , particle - particle , and hole - hole excitations @xcite .",
    "the pdm can explain the increase in gdr width with @xmath4 , at moderate @xmath4 and the width saturation at high @xmath4 .",
    "apart from the above discussed models , a few phenomenological parametrizations have been reported @xcite , which are very successful in explaining the global trend of the gdr width as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these parametrizations are constructed to mimic the results of tsfm and hence have only empirical basis without any microscopic or macroscopic foundation . however , in recent literature @xcite , these parametrizations are referred synonymously to models and hence should not be understood as a variant of tsfm .",
    "the damping of gdr width at low @xmath4 and the strong influence of pairing on gdr width were first suggested by one of the present authors @xcite .",
    "the first low-@xmath4 gdr width measurements were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite by measuring the @xmath6 decays in coincidence with @xmath7o particles scattered inelastically from @xmath1sn .",
    "these data were successfully explained by using the quasiparticle representation of the pdm @xcite incorporating the thermal pairing correlations .",
    "these calculations are based on the modified bcs approach , where the pairing gap does not vanish abruptly , but decreases slowly with increasing @xmath4 @xcite . in the conventional bcs approach ,",
    "the pairing gap collapses at a critical temperature of the transition from the superfluid phase to the normal one , which is equal to @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the pairing gap at @xmath10 . in another important low-@xmath4 measurement , the gdr width in @xmath2au @xcite at @xmath11 mev",
    "was observed to be similar to the ground - state value , in contrast to the expectation of a larger width due to the thermal excitations .",
    "the shell effects were predicted @xcite to explain this quenching , like in the case of @xmath3pb .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite it was reported that a proper inclusion of shell effects leads to an increase in gdr width in @xmath2au and there is a need for an exact treatment of the pairing fluctuations ( along with the tsf ) to overcome this discrepancy .",
    "subsequently , the importance of considering pairing in the tsfm has been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "very recently , gdr measurements in the low-@xmath4 regions were carried out at the variable energy cyclotron centre , kolkata @xcite and highlighted the interesting nuclear properties at low @xmath4 . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", it has been mentioned that it would also be interesting to compare the data with tsfm calculations by including the effect of thermal pairing . in some of these recent works",
    "@xcite , the empirical parametrizations ( which mimic the results of tsfm at higher @xmath4 ) were reported to fail in explaining the experimental data at low @xmath4 .",
    "it has to be noted that , at low @xmath4 , the application of even the proper tsfm is incomplete and hence the corresponding parametrizations would also fail .",
    "this difficulty in such a parametrization was overcome @xcite by introducing another empirical entity , i.e. , the gdr width at critical @xmath4 ( which corresponds to the width observed at lowest @xmath4 ) , and the gdr width below that critical @xmath4 was assumed to be the same constant value @xcite .    in the present work we discuss a proper tsfm that is also applicable at low @xmath4 .",
    "the success of a modified pairing approach @xcite at low-@xmath4 and that of the tsfm elsewhere @xcite have motivated us to consider a combination of pairing correlations within the tsfm .",
    "preliminary results of our approach can be found in refs .",
    "a short discussion on our approach and some important results for the nuclei @xmath0tc , @xmath1sn , and @xmath3pb were reported recently @xcite . here",
    "we present for the first time our complete formalism in detail along with elaborate discussions of our results for the nuclei @xmath0tc , @xmath1sn , and @xmath3pb .",
    "additionally , we present our results also for the nucleus @xmath2au .",
    "the theoretical approach we follow is explained in four parts corresponding to ( a ) the finite temperature nilsson - strutinsky method for deformation energy calculations , ( b ) the bcs approach for pairing , ( c ) the macroscopic approach for gdr which relates the shapes to gdr observables , and ( d ) thermal fluctuations in finite systems .      for deformation energy calculations ,",
    "we adopt a formalism based on the finite temperature nilsson - strutinsky method @xcite , which is extended to include thermal pairing .",
    "regarding strutinsky s ( microscopic - macroscopic ) prescription @xcite , the total free energy ( @xmath12 ) at a fixed deformation is calculated by using the expression @xmath13the sum at the right - hand side runs over protons ( @xmath14 ) and neutrons ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the macroscopic part , i.e. , the liquid - drop energy ( @xmath16 ) , is calculated by summing up the coulomb and surface energies @xcite corresponding to a triaxially deformed shape defined by the deformation parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( [ hill wheeler ] ) as @xmath19 + 2\\chi\\left[b_c(\\beta,\\gamma)-1\\right]a_s\\right\\}a^{2/3}. \\label{eldm}\\ ] ] the function @xmath20 gives the dependence of the surface energy on shape and is equal to the dimensionless ratio of the surface area of the shape in question to the area of the original sphere .",

    "both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are elliptic integrals which are evaluated for a given deformation . the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are chosen to be @xmath24 mev and @xmath25 , respectively , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the charge and mass numbers of the nucleus .",
    "it has to be noted that @xmath28 is the binding energy relative to that of a sphere and hence is termed the deformation energy .",
    "such a quantity is enough for us as we study only the variation of energy over the deformation space rather than its absolute value . at finite @xmath4 , in principle",
    ", one should consider that the free energy and the liquid drop parameters can have a @xmath4 dependence .",
    "however , any effect of @xmath4 on the liquid drop energy is found to be negligible at lower @xmath29 mev ) @xcite .",
    "this will be further attenuated in the deformation ( relative ) energy that we are interested in . at higher @xmath4 , the shell corrections vanish and hence the equilibrium shape becomes spherical where the deformation energy is zero .",
