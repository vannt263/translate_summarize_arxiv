    "rotation - powered pulsars ( rpps ) exhibit diverse interesting phenomena ranging from periodic pulsations to supersonic motions through the interstellar medium , as well as relativistic winds often revealed by interaction with the neighborhood .",
    "more than 30 years after the discovery of rpps , however , the origins for many of these phenomena still remain out of our grasp , although there has been a recent surge of development in some of these fields , largely driven by new x - ray satellites typified by _ chandra_. one of the many unprecedented features of the new x - ray satellites is superb angular resolutions ; for example , _ chandra _ gives @xmath2 1@xmath3 accuracy in the positions of x - ray sources , comparable to the typical optical and near - infrared ( ir ) observations .",
    "this enables high - precision comparative studies of x - ray and optical / near - ir results , such as more robust searches for optical / near - ir counterparts to rpps and multi - wavelength studies of their close vicinity .    in many ways ,",
    "the @xmath139.5 ms radio pulsar psr  b1951 + 32 @xcite in the ctb  80 supernova remnant ( snr ) provides a rare opportunity to study the interesting phenomena of rpps .",
    "it is a moderately young pulsar of 1.1 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yrs spin - down age , which is comparable to , but slightly larger than , the age determined by its proper motion ( 6.4 @xmath4 10@xmath6 yrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the dynamical age of ctb  80 ( 7.7 @xmath4 10@xmath6 yrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating a finite initial spin . the measured proper motion ( @xmath7  mas  yr@xmath8 ) corresponds to a velocity of @xmath9  km  s@xmath8 at 2 kpc , moving away from the snr center . in the optical , psr  b1951 + 32",
    "is located in a @xmath1@xmath10 nebular core emitting both balmer - dominated and forbidden lines .",
    "@xcite suggested that the core is a bow shock formed by the relativistic winds from the pulsar when it encountered the material behind a radiative shock of the snr .",
    "_ rosat _ x - ray observations were also suggestive of the pulsar wind nature of the core , albeit its inadequate spatial resolution @xcite . on the other hand , using archival data from the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) , @xcite reported a possible optical synchrotron knot near psr  b1951 + 32 , and @xcite claimed the detection of its two optical counterpart candidates .",
    "however , the lack of color information and rather large astrometric uncertainties make it difficult to reach any further conclusion on their nature .    in this _ letter _",
    ", we present x - ray and optical / near - ir observations of psr  b1951 + 32 , searching for the predicted x - ray pulsar wind nebula in the optical core , as well as the emission from the claimed optical synchrotron knot and counterpart candidates .",
    "the ctb 80 core was observed with _",
    "chandra _ on 2001 july 12 for a total good time of 78.2 ks using its advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( s3 chip ) , with a custom sub - array mode of 192 rows , minimizing pile - up on the pulsar while still imaging the entire core .",
    "figure  1 shows a resulting x - ray image , where a strong point source ( i.e. , psr  b1951 + 32 ; @xmath121,900 photon counts ) is embedded in diffuse emission .",
    "its position is ( 19:52:58.23 , + 32:52:41.0 ) with 002 uncertainties in each coordinate ( j2000 ) . considering the 06 systematic uncertainty of the _ chandra _ astrometry , the x - ray position is consistent with that inferred from pulsar radio timing @xcite .",
    "additionally , several other point sources were detected in the _ chandra _ image , and table  1 lists four of them which have isolated counterparts in the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "the offsets between their _ chandra _ and 2mass coordinates are smaller than 07 , comparable to the combined systematic uncertainty of the _ chandra _ and 2mass astrometry .",
    "( the systematic uncertainty of the 2mass astrometry is 02 . )",
    "we observed psr  b1951 + 32 on 2001 july 16 with the @xmath11 pixel ccd of carnegie observatories spectrograph and multi - object imaging camera ( cosmic ) on the 5-m palomar hale telescope .",
    "we used @xmath12 ( 500 nm ) , @xmath13 ( 655 nm ) , and @xmath14 ( 800 nm ) broad - band filters with 100  s integration time for each band , and proceeded with the standard data reduction , such as bias / dark - subtractions and flat - fielding .",
    "we next used @xmath1100 2mass point sources and the iraf task _ ccmap _ to obtain 028 ( ra ) and 040 ( dec ) astrometric uncertainties of the cosmic images .",
    "we also performed @xmath15 band ( 2.15  @xmath16 m ) observations with the keck  i telescope on 2003 november 6 using near - ir camera ( nirc ) equipped with a @xmath17 pixel insb detector .",
    "we obtained 18 dithered frames , each with 42  s integration time , and subtracted dark and median - combined sky frames .",
    "we then shifted and combined them to make a final image .",
    "in addition , we re - analyzed archival data for ctb  80 from wide field and planetary camera  2 aboard hst on 1997 october 2 .",
    "we used @xmath110 2mass point sources to obtain the astrometric solutions for the nirc and hst images with iraf _",
    "ccmap_.    figure  2 compares the h@xmath0 ( hst f656n band ; 2.2  nm wide at 656.4  nm ) image of the ctb  80 core with the x - ray image . in order to match them",
    ", we undertook the following procedure .",
    "_ first _ , we tied the _",
    "image to the cosmic images using the point sources in table  1 , which gave 025 uncertainty in each coordinate ( see the following paragraph for a detailed description ) .",
    "_ next _ , we replaced the cosmic image with the hst f656n band image .",
    "the astrometric discrepancy of them was estimated to be 024 ; therefore , the two images in figure  2 were matched with 035 uncertainty .",
    "in the bottom panel , we identify a @xmath1@xmath18 cometary x - ray nebula , elongated along the proper motion of psr  b1951 + 32 with the pulsar at the head .",
    "the tail shows diffuse and extended emission in the northeast , where the pulsar has traveled .",
    "the south - western boundary of the nebula appears to be confined by a bow shock - like feature in h@xmath0 , and the x - ray emission shows a steep gradient in the confined region .",
    "figure  3 presents the distribution of the x - ray and h@xmath0 emission along the proper motion of psr  b1951 + 32 ( i.e. , the arrow in the bottom panel of figure  2 ) , showing that the h@xmath0 emission peaks @xmath17@xmath3 ahead of the pulsar in the direction of its proper motion .",
    "figure  4 shows the cosmic  @xmath19 , hst  f547 ( 48.6 nm wide at 547.9 nm ) , and nirc  @xmath15 band images centered on psr  b1951 + 32 . in the cosmic images , we determined the pulsar position in two different ways .",
    "_ first _ , we simply found its _",
    "chandra _ position in the cosmic astrometry with 053 ( ra ) and 060 ( dec ) uncertainties , dominated by the systematic astrometric uncertainties of _ chandra _ and 2mass and by uncertainties in the cosmic astrometry . the large dotted circle in figure  4(f ) represents the position of psr  b1951 + 32 determined in this way .",
    "_ secondly _ , the _ chandra _ image was tied to the cosmic images using the x - ray point sources and their 2mass counterparts in table  1 , where the ( intrinsic ) x - ray positional uncertainties of the point sources and the uncertainties of the cosmic astrometry dominate the final uncertainties of 025 in each coordinate .",
    "the small outlined circle in figure  4(f ) represents the position of psr  b1951 + 32 determined in this way .",
    "the positions of the two claimed optical counterpart candidates ( i.e. , 1hst and 4hst ; butler et al .",
    "2002 ) are shown in figure  4(f )  while 1hst is within the error circle , 4hst is outside .",
    "the optical synchrotron knot of psr  b1951 + 32 reported by @xcite was identified in the hst f547 m band image in figure  4(e ) . given e(b@xmath20v ) @xmath21 0.8 extinction towards psr  b1951 + 32 @xcite , the extinction - corrected magnitude of the knot is @xmath22 (= @xmath23 \\times 10^{-5}$ ]  jy ) in the f547 m band .",
    "the knot was also clearly detected in the @xmath13 and @xmath15 bands ( figure  4b , d ) , with estimated extinction - corrected magnitudes of @xmath24 (= @xmath25 \\times 10^{-5}$ ]  jy ) and @xmath26 (= @xmath27 \\times 10^{-5}$ ]  jy ) , respectively .",
    "( the quoted uncertainties represent the 68.3% confidence levels . )",
    "however , emission associated with the knot was not detected in the hst data obtained with narrow - band line filters of f502n ( 2.7 nm wide at 502.3 nm ) , f656n , and f673n ( 4.7 nm wide at 673.2 nm ) .",
    "previous optical and x - ray observations showed that psr  b1951 + 32 has likely been interacting with the recombining material behind the radiative shock of the ctb  80 snr , likely forming a bow shock in the core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radio continuum images resemble our _ chandra _ image , together with a feature reminiscent of a bow shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure  23 ,",
    "the h@xmath0 emission overlaps the x - ray emission in the core ( especially in the eastern part ) , and , around psr  b1951 + 32 , it also shows a bow shock - like feature confining the cometary x - ray nebula .",
    "one simple interpretation of the overall emission of the ctb  80 core ( except for the bow shock - associated features around psr  b1951 + 32 ; see below ) is that the x - ray and radio emission represent the synchrotron radiation of relativistic pulsar winds , while the h@xmath0 emission does cooling , recombining thermal plasma shocked by them ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that this still allows the existence of h@xmath0 emission purely associated with the ctb  80  snr , which might be responsible for the h@xmath0 emission in the western lobes of the ctb  80 core apparently lacking the x - ray and/or radio counterparts , different from one in the eastern part .    obviously , the most distinctive new feature of the ctb  80 core is the cometary x - ray nebula headed by psr  b1951 + 32 along its proper motion , seemingly confined by the h@xmath0 emission forming bow - shock morphology at @xmath1@xmath28 ahead of the pulsar ( figure  2 ) .",
    "the revelation of such a feature is in good accordance with the previous interpretation of the ctb  80 core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the cometary x - ray nebula represents the shocked pulsar winds confined by an h@xmath0 bow shock formed by collisional excitation of the ambient medium via supersonic motion of psr  b1951 + 32 . for this",
    ", it is important to note that there is a significant contribution of collisional excitation to the h@xmath0 emission in the ctb  80 core ( in addition to the recombination mentioned above ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is supportive of the bow - shock interpretation .",
    "one interesting result is that the distance ( from the pulsar ) to the h@xmath0 bow shock ( @xmath1@xmath28 ) is larger than the value ( @xmath1@xmath29 ) obtained for the radio bow shock @xcite , indicating the location of a contact discontinuity of the inner and outer shocks between them , with the radio emission representing the inner shock ( or shocked pulsar winds ) .",
    "assuming @xmath30 to be the projected angular distance to the contact discontinuity , we obtain @xmath10.05 pc at 2 kpc .    in order to have the bow shock formed",
    ", ram pressure balance is required between the relativistic pulsar winds and the ambient medium : @xmath31 @xmath21 @xmath32/@xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the ambient medium density , @xmath35 the pulsar velocity , @xmath32 the pulsar spin - down energy , @xmath36 the solid angle through which the pulsar winds flow , @xmath37 the speed of the light , and @xmath38 the stagnation radius .",
    "assumption of equipartition between the pressure of magnetic field and of particle near the bow shock leads to @xmath39 @xmath1 50(@xmath40/@xmath41)@xmath42(@xmath35/100  km  s@xmath8 ) , where @xmath40 is the hydrogen number density , and also to @xmath39 @xmath1 200@xmath43(@xmath32/10@xmath44  ergs  s@xmath8)@xmath42(@xmath38/0.01  pc)@xmath8 .",
    "the observed values @xmath35 @xmath21 240  km  s@xmath8 , @xmath32 @xmath21 3.7@xmath410@xmath44  ergs  s@xmath8 , and @xmath38 @xmath21 0.03  pc ( @xmath21@xmath29 ) of psr  b1951 + 32 , as well as @xmath45 @xmath46 1 , estimate that @xmath47 @xmath48 100 @xmath16 g .",
    "this reconciles with @xcite which estimated the preshock density and magnetic field to be @xmath150  @xmath49 and @xmath1600  @xmath50 . for @xmath47 = 600  @xmath50 , @xmath45 @xmath46 0.1 , corresponding to highly anisotropic pulsar winds .",
    "if we assume that @xmath51 @xmath48 100  @xmath50 in the entire cometary x - ray nebula , its synchrotron cooling time is @xmath52 @xmath1 40@xmath53 ( @xmath54)@xmath55 @xmath46 40 yrs , where @xmath56 is the observed photon energy in kev . considering the size ( @xmath1@xmath57 ) of the cometary x - ray nebula and the magnitude of the psr  b1951 + 32 proper motion ( @xmath125  mas  yr@xmath8 )",
    ", the short cooling time indicates that the cometary x - ray nebula has likely been replenished by the relativistic pulsar winds flowing from the pulsar . note that similar results have recently been reported for other pulsar wind nebulae @xcite . in conclusion , after the millisecond ( recycled ) pulsar psr  b1957 + 20 @xcite , psr  b1951 + 32 is only a second pulsar showing both inner and outer shocks in a pulsar wind nebula , and it is a unique pulsar exhibiting such a feature in the optical , x - ray , and radio emission together .",
    "our results confirm that the claimed optical synchrotron knot of psr  b1951 + 32 is indeed a continuum source in nature . in figure  4",
    ", the emission from the knot appears to be present in the all five broad bands ( although its significance is weak in the @xmath12 and @xmath14 bands ) . for the hst data ,",
    "the knot is visible only in the relatively line - free f547 m band image ( figure  4[e ] ) , while it is absent in the narrow - band line filter images ( i.e. , f502n , f656n , and f673n ) .",
    "thus , the knot exhibits continuum emission with a flat spectrum in the optical and near - ir wavebands ( see   2 for the flux estimation ) , unless it has a significant variability .",
    "the crab pulsar is also known to have a similar optical synchrotron knot @xcite which might be caused by quasi - stationary shocks from pulsar polar outflows @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , of the two optical counterpart candidates for psr  b1951 + 32 @xcite , our improved astrometry is consistent only with 1hst ( while it excludes 4hst ; figure  4 ) .",
    "however , it is possible that 1hst simply represents non - uniformity in the optical synchrotron knot or emission from any background star .",
    "we need multi - epoch , multi - color observations to study the synchrotron knot and optical counterpart more thoroughly .",
