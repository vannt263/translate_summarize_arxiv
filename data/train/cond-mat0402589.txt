    "one of the most intriguing normal properties of the high-@xmath2 ( ht@xmath4 ) cuprates is the so called  pseudogap ",
    "( pg ) phenomenon .",
    "it is commonly presented in the @xmath5 plane as a line that starts from rather high temperatures ( at small @xmath6 ) and reaches the superconductivity ( sc ) @xmath2  dome  below at or above optimal @xmath7 . in a broad sense @xmath6",
    "means the hole concentration in the cuo@xmath3- plane , but more often than not one refers to properties of the sr - doped la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 the pg feature was seen in numerous experiments ( nmr , tunneling spectra , resistivity etc . ; see for example reviews @xcite ) .",
    "it has been stressed @xcite that the pg temperature is not defined unambiguously .",
    "a widespread view is that the feature comes from some crossover in the electronic density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the main result of the present paper is that after a proper re - arrangement of the experimental data no pg feature exists in the @xmath0cu nuclear spin relaxation time behaviour .",
    "instead , the data show two independent parallel relaxation mechanisms : a temperature independent one that we attribute to stripes caused by the presence of external dopants and an ",
    "universal  temperature dependent term which turns out to be exactly the same as in the stoichiometric compound ybco 124 .",
    "we attempt below to put the results in the context of a phase separation @xcite .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath11 into two terms , as it will be discussed below in more details , manifests itself in a broad temperature interval above @xmath2 .",
    "it is limited from above by a @xmath12 that depends on the concentration , @xmath6 .",
    "we consider @xmath12 defined in this way as a temperature of a 1st order phase transition , which , however , can not complete itself in spatial coexistence of two phases because of the electroneutrality condition @xcite .",
    "it was already argued in @xcite that such a frustrated 1st order phase transition may actually bear a dynamical character .",
    "the fact that a single resonant frequency for the @xmath0cu nuclear spin is observed in the nmr experiments , confirms this suggestion .",
    "although in what follows , we use the notions of the lattice model @xcite , even purely electronic models @xcite for cuprates may reveal a tendency to phase separation .    the basic assumption in @xcite are the following .",
    "at large enough doping holes move between coppers and oxygens .",
    "spins in the system are @xmath13-holes trapped to the cu - sites at the expense of local lattice distorsions .",
    "elastic attractive interactions between these distorsions give rise to a lattice driven frustrated transition below some @xmath12 .",
    "exchange interactions , as in the parent la@xmath14cuo@xmath10 , tend to organize the cu - spins in the antiferromagnetic ( af ) sub - phases .",
    "excess charge of the dopants ions in af regions must be compensated by accumulation of holes in  metallic  regions .",
    "we now turn to experimental data . in what follows",
    "we address only @xmath15 behaviour because for cuprates af fluctuations prevail over the korringa mechanisms .    in fig .",
    "1a we collected data on @xmath16 in lsco from @xcite .",
    "note the following : 1 ) according to @xcite @xmath1 at higher temperatures tends to 2.7 msec@xmath17 _ for all _ sr concentrations , in spite of considerable spread seen in fig .",
    "1a . beginning of deviation from that value could serve us as a definition of @xmath18 ; 2 ) note that dissipation @xmath16  monotonically decreases from small @xmath6 to 0.24 ; 3 ) after an appropriate _ vertical _ offset all curves in fig .",
    "1a collapse onto the @xmath19 dependence of @xmath16 for the `` optimal '' @xmath20 above 50 k ( fig .",
    "we have checked that last tendency works well for ybco ( 6.5 ) doped with ca i.e. , the data for different @xmath21 in y@xmath22ca@xmath23ba@xmath3 cu@xmath24 o@xmath25 @xcite may be put on the top of each other after proper offsets .",
    "this prompts us to verify whether same  off - settings  of the @xmath16 data apply to a broader group of materials .",
    "the stoichiometric yba@xmath3cu@xmath26o@xmath27 possesses no structural or defect disorder and we adjust all data to the @xmath16 behaviour for this material @xcite .",
    "2 shows that after a vertical shift in @xmath16 all the materials indeed follow the same  universal  temperature dependence above their @xmath2 and below 300 k. in other words , in this temperature range the nuclear spin relaxation in these cuprates is a sum of contributions from two parallel processes : @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath29 depends on a material and a degree of disorder @xmath30 , but does not depend on temperature , while @xmath31 , depends only on temperature , is the same for all these compounds and coincides with the @xmath16 for the two chains ybco 124 above its @xmath2=62 k.    thus , to some surprise the only  pseudogap  feature in the nmr data that may be discerned in fig.2 is the one for ybco 124 : a change in the temperature regime between 130 and 180 k. it would be tempting to take again this feature as a mark of the ps regime taking place now in the stoichiometric material where doping most definitely comes about as a spill - over of carriers from the cuo - chains into cuo@xmath3 planes .",
    "it is also natural to think that the number of the transferred carriers is not small : actually the low temperature hall effect measurements @xcite show a rapid increase in the number of carriers ( i.e. fermi surface size ) up to one hole per unit cell even in the single layer material like lsco , at the optimal doping @xmath32 0.15 .",
    "recall , however , that little is known for the  homogeneous  phase ( i.e. above @xmath18 ) . properties of both ybco 124 and the optimally doped lsco ( see @xcite for review ) are unusual and best described in a very broad temperature interval in terms of the  marginal  fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "we have not found a reliable experiment to define @xmath12 for these compounds and therefore leave the origin of the @xmath33-term for further discussions .",
    "the decomposition ( 1 ) into two parallel dissipation processes show that usual definitions of @xmath12 @xcite have no grounds . in fig.1a",
    "the lsco data with @xmath34 are spread even above 250 k. as a rough estimate for @xmath12 , it is much higher than the sc onset temperature .",
    "3 presents the dependence on @xmath6 for @xmath35 in la@xmath36sr@xmath9cuo@xmath37 the inset provides the  offsets ",
    "( i.e. @xmath38 terms ) for other materials .",
    "we return to discussion of fig.3 later .",
    "the observation that is central for the following is that in all the materials with non - zero @xmath35 ( see the inset in fig.3 ) incommensurate ( ic ) peaks have been observed in neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "peaks are close to the @xmath39 $ ]  point : at @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] @xcite .",
    "we will now look for the connection between these two phenomena .",
    "we first make an attempt to agree on a semi - quantitative level the observed ic magnetic peaks in la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 with the values of the first term in eq .",
    "we concentrate on la@xmath42sr@xmath43cuo@xmath10 for which the most detailed data are available @xcite .    with the notation from @xcite @xmath44where @xmath45 stands for one peak ,  hyperfine  tensor",

    "this is the correct order of magnitude .",
    "the descending dependence of the offset ( fig.3 ) agrees qualitatively with the behavior of @xmath64 @xcite in eq.(4 ) . for a quantitative description one",
    "need to know the @xmath6-dependence for @xmath65 .",
    "such data in the absolute units are absent yet except aeppli .",
    "another fact that may underlie this behaviour is that with the _",
    "x_-increase buckling in the cuo@xmath3-planes is known to decrease diminishing pinning effects and making the local symmetry of the cuo@xmath3-unit same as in other materials from the class with small offset in fig.3 .",
    "also , the system grows more metallic with a high holes ",
    "content 31,33,34 .",
    "next  comes the question concerning the origin and the role played by ic peaks and the physics of fluctuations related to them .",
    "discovery of ic spin fluctuations presented a challenge for explaining the nmr results for the oxygen spin relaxation times : hyperfine field ",
    "leaks  originated by the af incommensurate fluctuations , would considerably increase the oxygen s relaxation rates , but this was not seen experimentally .",
    "slichter ( see in ref.@xcite ) interpreted these contradictions in terms of  discommensurations  : a periodic array of soliton - like walls separating regions with a short - range af order .",
    "unlike neutrons , the nmr as a local probe , does not feel the overall periodicity .",
    "existence of stripes looks just natural in terms of a static phase separation . at doping the system ( lsco )",
    "must screen the excess charge ( sr@xmath66-ions ) in af regions .",
    "therefore stripes of the af ordered phase must alternate with ",
    "domain walls .",
    "the stripe arrangement by itself is nothing but an optimization of the competing coulomb and lattice forces @xcite .",
    "( the phenomena is well known in physics of surface . )",
    "stripes in a dynamical regime need better understanding .",
    "for instance , often the ic peaks are seen by neutrons only at low enough temperatures or for large energy transfer at an inelastic scattering @xcite . at low temperatures",
    "stripes may form a long - range order even in lsco ( at smaller @xmath6 , @xcite ) , breaking the symmetry of the ground state .",
    "a better example of the  pinned  stripe order is given by nd ( or eu)-doped lsco @xcite .",
    "( la@xmath67nd@xmath68sr@xmath69cuo@xmath10 reproduces all features of la@xmath70sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 ,  including sc and same positions for ic peaks at given @xmath6 . )",
    "the transition into the ordered stripe phase is driven by appearance first of the lattice / charge peaks @xcite . at finite temperatures stripes",
    "could be viewed as a new type of excitations above the ordered state .    on the other hand in lsco itself ",
    "stripes  are seen through the inelastic scattering processes for arbitrary low energy transfer even at high temperatures 100 - 300 k @xcite . while the ordered ic ground state sets in only well below , at about @xmath71 30k @xcite .",
    "this example provides the argument against treating ",
    "stripes  as  excitations  : at so high a temperature the underlying  long - range  ic ground state would be already melted .",
    "therefore the two - phase description seems to be closer to reality meaning that in the dynamical regime the af regions get coupled via coulomb forces with the  metallic  layer .",
    "note that with the further x - increase  @xmath64 increases as well and saturates making it meaningless to speak in terms of a strictly  monolayer  wall already above @xmath72 0.14 , where @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "( note the difference in notations for ic peaks : ( @xmath74 from @xcite equals @xmath75 from @xcite equals @xmath76 from @xcite ) .",
    "fig.3 demonstrates same tendency to increase the share of the  metallic  fraction with increase of sr - concentration : @xmath29 continues to drop with @xmath6 above 1/8 .",
    "coexistence of a sc and the ic af phases at low temperatures was confirmed recently by the neutron diffraction experiments @xcite for la@xmath8sr@xmath69cuo@xmath10 @xmath77 in the vortex state .",
    "( the coexistence of sc and af formations was found also from the @xmath78sr spectra @xcite ) .",
    "the way of the  coexistence  of sc and the stripe order in the same sample remains unresolved : one view treats the new stripe symmetry as a superstructure superimposed on the fermi surface that changes the energy spectrum like any sdw / cdw can do it ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another plausible alternative would be a spatially inhomogeneous coexistence of the nonsuperconducting ic af phase and a ",
    "metallic  phase with strong fluctuations .",
    "we have found that in a temperature interval above @xmath2 and below some @xmath79300 k the nuclear spin relaxation for a broad class of cuprates comes from two independent mechanisms : relaxation on the``stripe``-like excitations that leads to a temperature independent contribution to @xmath16 and an `` universal '' temperature dependent term .",
    "for la@xmath42sr@xmath43cuo@xmath10 we obtained a correct quantitative estimate for the value of the first term .",
    "we concluded from eq.(1 ) and fig.3 that ' ' stripes '' always come about with external doping and may be pinned by structural defects .",
    "we argue that the whole pattern fits well the notion of the dynamical ps into coexisting metallic and ic magnetic phases .",
    "experimentally , it seems that with the temperature decrease dynamical ps acquires the static character with the ic symmetry breaking for af phase dictated by the competition between the lattice and the coulomb forces .",
    "the form of coexistence of the ic magnetism with sc below @xmath2 remains not understood as well as behaviour of stoichiometric cuprates .",
