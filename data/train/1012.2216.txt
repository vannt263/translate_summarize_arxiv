    "the essence of the problem with the study of the above quoted nuclear reactions is that the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is non - perturbative at low energies .",
    "the way of handling this obstacle has already been outlined 50 years ago by realizing that the description of the electro - weak interaction with a nuclear system , containing nucleons and pions , should be based on the spontaneously broken global chiral symmetry su(2)@xmath36 su(2)@xmath37",
    "@xcite , reflected in the qcd lagrangian @xcite . this fundamental concept was realized after studying the commutation relations of the charges corresponding to the lepton currents for the system of electrons and muons with zero masses . in this case , the lepton charges satisfy the commutation relations of the group su(2 ) @xmath1 su(2 ) @xcite .",
    "the lepton charges are defined as q_l&=&^+d^3 r , [ vc ] + q_5l&=&^+_5d^3 r , [ ac ] where @xmath38 is the lepton isospin .    from eqs.([vc ] ) and ( [ ac ] ) one obtains = i_ijkq_kl , [ cr1 ] = i_ijkq_kl , [ cr2 ] = i _ ijk q_5kl .",
    "[ cr3 ]    gell - mann made an assumption @xcite that the universality of the weak interactions for the leptons and hadrons declares itself in that the charges connected with the hadron currents satisfy the same simultaneous commutation relations as the lepton currents .",
    "besides , the vector part of the weak nucleon current should satisfy the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis , that permits the identification of the weak vector current with the isovector part of the electromagnetic current . in its turn",
    "the weak axial nucleon current should satisfy the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) hypothesis , q_1 , ^a_a,(q_1 ) = if _ m^2_^_f(q^2_1)m^a_. [ pcac ] here f@xmath39 is the pion decay constant , @xmath40 is the pion mass , @xmath41 = 1@xmath42 is the pion propagator and @xmath43 is the matrix element of the pion production / absorption amplitude between the one - nucleon states .",
    "it is seen that the axial current is conserved in the limit of zero pion mass .",
    "this development induced a burst of calculations and powerful low - energy theorems for the weak- and electro - production of pions on nucleon at the threshold were established @xcite . since this concept is correct only for pions with @xmath44 = 0 ,",
    "the pions are called soft .",
    "let us note that the results based on current algebras are model independent .",
    "the spontaneously broken global chiral symmetry su(2)@xmath36 su(2)@xmath37 predicts the existence of three massless particles with the quantum numbers 0@xmath45 in the ground state @xcite . since this symmetry is broken by the finite mass of the quarks ,",
    "also these particles acquire finite mass , and they can be identified with pions .",
    "let us note that eq.([mehw ] ) is valid also for the nuclear processes with the electromagnetic lepton and nuclear currents .",
    "applying eq.([mehw ] ) in calculations of the processes in nuclei , one first supposed that the nuclear current is approximated by the sum of the one - nucleon currents ( [ jw ] ) .",
    "this approximation is called the impulse approximation ( ia ) .",
    "generally , this concept worked well at low energies but it was found that , in some cases , it failed to describe the data .",
    "first it happened in the case of thermal neutron capture by proton , n+pd+ , [ npdg ] that the precise experimental value of the cross section , @xmath46 = 334.2 @xmath7 0.5 mb @xmath3 ] @xcite , is larger by @xmath0 10 % than the ia cross section , @xmath48 = 302.5 @xmath7 4.0 mb @xcite .",
    "this reaction is triggered by the space component of the electromagnetic isovector current , which is of the order @xmath49(1/m ) .",
    "here for the first time , meson exchange currents ( mecs ) rescued the situation .",
    "the pion production amplitude , evaluated in the soft pion limit , provided mecs ( see fig.1c and fig.1d ) that removed about 70 % of the discrepancy @xcite .",
    "0.4 cm    possible presence of the two - nucleon currents follows also from the potential description of the two - nucleon system that we consider for the sake of simplicity . in this case ,",
    "the nuclear hamiltonian is h = t+v , [ h ] where t is the kinetic energy and v is the nuclear potential . for the electromagnetic current , @xmath50 , the current conservation reads , q j(q)=[h,(q ) ] .",
    "[ cc ] writing the current as the sum of the one - nucleon and two - nucleon parts , j_(q)=^2_1 j_(1,i , q_i)+j_(2,q ) , [ cur ] one gets q_i j(1,i , q_i)&=&[t_i,(1,i , q_i)],i=1,2 , [ obc ] + q j(2,q)&=&[t_1+t_2,(2,q)]+([v,(1,1,q_1 ) ] + ( 12 ) ) , [ tbc ] where @xmath51 = @xmath52 + @xmath53 .",
    "it is seen from eq.([tbc ] ) that this equation can not be fulfilled if the mecs are absent .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the approach of soft pions is valid at the threshold energies .",
    "next we discuss the concept of chiral lagrangians allowing to go beyond this restriction .",

    "the constructed currents satisfy the fundamental commutation relations known from the soft - pion approach .",
    "+ 2 . in the limit of zero pion mass",
    "the weak axial current is exactly conserved , + should reproduce the results of the soft - pion technique @xcite .",
    "this is possible thanks to the fact that the correct results are obtained already at the level of trees ( no loops ) .",
    "the chiral lagrangians of the pion - nucleon system reflect the global chiral symmetry .",
    "standardly , they are constructed in non - linear realization of the chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "one can also consider the lagrangians reflecting the local chiral symmetry @xcite . this step allowed to extend the nuclear system by the @xmath54- and a@xmath55 mesons , as compensating yang - mills fields .",
    "however , the problem was that the heavy meson masses violated the symmetry .",
    "later on , a concept of hidden local symmetry allowed one to avoid this conceptual difficulty @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear hard pion chiral lagrangians @xcite served then as starting point for constructing the one - boson exchange currents in the tree approximation .",
    "we shall call this concept as the tree approximation approach ( taa ) .",
    "this approach was also applied to construct the one - boson exchange potentials @xcite . besides the potentials of this sort , many phenomenological potentials of various quality were also constructed @xcite .",
    "the precise second generation potentials nijmegen i @xcite , cd - bonn @xcite and av18 @xcite have @xmath56 1 .",
    "let us note that in order to make realistic calculations , both the one - boson mecs and potentials should be supplied with the strong form factors by hands .",
    "fortunately , this can be done in such a way that the cvc and pcac hypotheses are still valid .",
    "consequently , one can describe the mecs effect consistently : both the mecs and nuclear potentials are obtained within the same approach .",
    "the reactions ( [ nc])-([cc ] ) and ( [ mudc])-([mu3hec ] ) were studied within taa in refs.@xcite .",
    "these reactions are triggered by the space component of the weak current .",

    "this fact makes the calculations of the weak axial mecs effects difficult .    here",

    ".    0.4 cm    from 1980 s , in parallel with the above discussed schemes of the calculations in nuclear physics , new approach was worked out , providing more general framework for systematic construction of many body currents and potentials .",
    "the price for this was explicit absence of all degrees of freedom in the lagrangian but nucleons and pions and applicability to nuclear phenomena only in the low energy region .",
    "the fundamental step allowing to go beyond the tree approximation was made by weinberg in 1979 @xcite . in this work",
    ", weinberg formulated an effective field theory ( eft ) : if one writes down the most general possible lagrangian , including all terms consistent with assumed symmetry principles , and then calculates matrix elements with this lagrangian to any given order of perturbation theory , the result will be the most general possible s - matrix consistent with perturbative unitarity , analyticity , cluster decomposition , and the assumed symmetry properties .",
    "so in this way , one can construct dynamical theory , not limited to the tree approximation .    at low energies , the effective degrees of freedom in nuclear physics are pions and nucleons , rather than quarks and gluons .",
    "with the heavy mesons and nucleon resonances integrated out and the spontaneously broken global chiral symmetry as assumed symmetry , one obtains the @xmath35pt of the nucleon - pion system .",

    "besides , @xmath63 is the weak interaction constant .    at the second order , seven independent terms",
    "appear , at the third order , one has 23 independent terms , and at the dimension four , there are 118 independent operators @xcite .",
    "each term is multiplied by a ( low energy ) constant ( lec ) that is fixed either in the process of the elimination of heavier resonances , or by the data .",
    "weinberg also established counting rules @xcite allowing one to classify the importance of contribution of various diagrams into perturbative expansion of the s - matrix in positive powers @xmath64 of @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a quantity characterizing the hadron system ( momentum , energy or the pion mass ) which is small in comparison with the heavy scale @xmath67 1 gev .",
    "as we have already noted above , in order to calculate reliably the capture rates and cross sections of reactions one needs to know accurately the nuclear wave functions ( potentials ) and the current operators .",
    "the weak axial currents were constructed within the @xmath35pt in refs.@xcite . at the leading ( @xmath64=0)- ( lo ) and the next - to - leading ( @xmath64=1 ) ( nlo ) orders , the weak nuclear current consists of the well - known single nucleon terms .",
    "the space component of the weak axial mecs , which is of the main interest here because it enters in calculations of observables in all weak reactions mentioned above , appears at n@xmath10lo ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "we already know that the single nucleon current is known precisely . on the other hand , in the space component of the weak axial",
    "mecs appears one lec , called @xmath69 .",
    "this parameter manifests itself in the two - nucleon contact vertex with the weak axial current ( see fig.[figg3 ] ) . besides , it is present also in a contact term part of the three - nucleon force constructed within the @xmath35pt .",
