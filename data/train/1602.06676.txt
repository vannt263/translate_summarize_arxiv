    "an electron has an intrinsic ( spin ) angular momentum and associated with this a magnetic moment . when an electric current flows , it is accompanied by a flow of spin angular momentum . for non - magnetic",
    "( nm ) materials like copper , the current of electrons with spin in a particular direction ( e.g. `` up '' ) is compensated by an equal current of electrons with spin in the opposite direction ( `` down '' ) so there is no net flow of spin angular momentum . in a ferromagnetic ( fm ) material with an unequal number of spin - up and spin - down electrons , there is a flow of spin angular momentum but this only has observable consequences when translational symmetry is broken .",
    "this happens , for example , at an interface with a nm metal where spin angular moment is injected into the nm metal leading to `` spin accumulation '' @xcite .",
    "it also happens when the magnetization direction depends on the position in space as in a domain wall ( dw ) where there is a continuous transition of the magnetization direction between two domains in which it is entirely collinear ( up or down for the @xmath1 dw sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", spin angular momentum is transported by an electric current from one region of space to another where it leads to an imbalance and tends to realign the angular momentum and magnetization direction of both regions of space .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` spin - transfer torque '' ( stt ) @xcite and it forms the basis for writing information in magnetic random access memories @xcite or for microwave frequency stt oscillators where the injected spin forces a magnetization to precess with ghz frequency @xcite .",
    "passage of a spin - polarized current can also cause a domain wall to move .",
    "this is the principle behind a new form of shift register called `` racetrack memory '' @xcite .    the stt was first predicted based upon the conservation of spin angular momentum ; a loss of spin current , @xmath2 , corresponds to a torque @xmath3 exerted on the local magnetization@xcite .",
    "various theoretical methods were proposed to compute stts with realistic electronic structures @xcite and a number of these were implemented with first - principles electronic structure calculations @xcite . not all are suitable for studying the effect of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) on stt though @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction couples the electron spin to its orbital motion and the stt exerted on a local magnetization can be larger than the maximum spin angular momentum that can be transferred from conduction electrons , i.e. an amount of @xmath4 per electron .",
    "it was recently found that stts arising from soc can be more efficient in driving magnetization switching , forcing oscillation , or moving magnetic dws @xcite .",
    "two quite distinct theoretical formalisms have been proposed to calculate the stt without assuming spin angular momentum conservation .",
    "the method proposed by the austin group @xcite is to calculate the stt in terms of the exchange interaction between the local magnetization and a nonequilibrium magnetization generated by the current .",
    "we will refer to this as the nonequilibrium magnetization ( nem ) scheme .",
    "the effect of soc is explicitly included in the hamiltonian that is used to determine the current - induced nonequilibrium magnetization .",
    "the nem scheme has been applied to calculate stt in spin valves @xcite , magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite , and ferromagnet@xmath5normal metal bilayers .",
    "@xcite the other method is to consider the charge current pumped by a time varying magnetization . by making use of onsager reciprocity relations ,",
    "this can be used to derive the stt @xcite .",
    "the charge pumping formalism is also applicable when soc is included in the hamiltonian .    in this paper ,",
    "we study the out - of - plane stt in ballistic dws taking nickel as an example .",
    "while numerical values of these torques have been reported in the diffusive regime for real materials using realistic electronic structures @xcite , its physical origin remains unclear .",
    "@xcite experimental observations are usually interpreted by comparing the measured velocities of current - driven dws with the results of micromagnetic simulations , a procedure that is not straightforward .",
    "for instance , the gilbert damping must be accurately taken into account in simulations @xcite but its form in noncollinear magnetizations is still the subject of discussion @xcite . by implementing both the charge pumping and the nem formalisms using first - principles scattering theory @xcite and using them to calculate the out - of - plane stt in ballistic dws , we demonstrate the quantitative equivalence of the two computational schemes .",
    "the stts obtained in ballistic dws can be understood in terms of the scattering of electrons by the noncollinear magnetization as characterized by the dw resistance ( dwr ) . for very short dws , the nonadiabatic reflection of conduction electrons by the large magnetization gradients gives rise to a relatively large dwr and out - of - plane torque . in the long dw limit",
    ", the dwr is dominated by the length - independent intrinsic dwr @xcite that results from an anisotropy in the distribution of conducting channels induced by soc in combination with the noncollinear magnetization .",
    "electron reflection due to the intrinsic dwr gives rise to an out - of - plane torque that scales linearly with the dw length .",
    "we calculate the amplitude of this torque using the two different methods and obtain values in good quantitative agreement with each other .",
