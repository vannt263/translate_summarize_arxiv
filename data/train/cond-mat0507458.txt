    "the survival of ferromagnetic ordering under the disruption of frozen random fields  @xcite and the onset of spin - glass ( sg ) order in systems characterized by random competing interactions  @xcite are two central problems in the statistical mechanics of systems with quenched randomness . when properly rephrased , these two problems turn out to relate to core problems in other , quite different disciplines .",

    "finite - connectivity mean - field sg models  @xcite and their _",

    "the analysis of finite - connectivity sg systems has also offered new tools for understanding the very nature of several optimization problems _ and _ improve algorithmic performances  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we first obtain the phase diagram of finite - connectivity mean - field sg models .",
    "we then investigate the relation between features of the phase diagram and the performance of low density parity check ( ldpc ) codes , analyzing the effects induced by the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) nature of solutions obtained for these finite - connectivity sg models  @xcite . in order to answer these questions",
    ", we exploit the relation between finite - connectivity sg systems and a class of exactly solvable models ; we employ an efficient computational method that has been shown to be quite effective for understanding several features of finite - dimensional sg  @xcite .",
    "we will consider a generalized model unifying the frameworks for a few distinct problems .",

    "methods to achieve reliable information transmission rely on the introduction of structured redundancy to the original message in order to compensate for corruption due to noise .",
    "shannon derived rigorous bounds on the level of redundancy ( the code rate ) required to enable error - free communication for a given channel noise  @xcite .",
    "however , shannon s theorems are non - constructive and do not offer a practical coding scheme .",
    "different methods , based on various redundancy construction recipes , have been proposed over the years  @xcite . despite the fact that error - correcting codes are now widely used in a variety of applications , current performances of most methods are significantly below shannon s bound .",

    "the relation between the parity - check error - correcting codes and sg models , and consequently between quite different disciplines as statistical physics and information theory , has been pointed to in the seminal work of sourlas  @xcite .",

    "we therefore briefly review the rs theory of the model described by hamiltonian ( [ rfrb ] ) as both the bethe sg and ldpc decoding can be considered as special cases of the same model .    to compute the free energy of the problem , consider the replica equality , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the analytical continuation in the interval @xmath75 $ ] of the replicated partition function  @xcite . following the standard derivation , e.g. as in  @xcite , and employing the rs anstz , one obtains the following expression for the replica symmetric free - energy as a function of the local field distribution @xmath76 ( details can be found in appendix a ) @xmath77 there are both site and bond contributions , @xmath78    where @xmath79 denotes an average over the two sources of randomness in ( [ rfrb ] ) , and @xmath80 we denote @xmath81 where @xmath82 \\nonumber \\\\ \\beta a ( \\ { x_j \\},j)&= & \\frac{1}{2 } \\log [ r(+)r(- ) ] \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the polynomials @xmath83 are defined via , @xmath84 , \\label{poly}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 .",

    "we propose an alternative approach to existing methods ( e.g. population dynamics or monte carlo techniques ) which solves equations of the form ( [ crux ] ) efficiently and accurately .",
    "the main reason why it has not been used to study finite - connectivity sg models so far is because of the different context in which it was firstly introduced @xcite .",
