    "blazars are the most extreme class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , probably resulting when an agn is viewed along its relativistic jet axis . although a variety of models have been proposed , and despite decades of observation , many fundamental questions about blazars and agn physics remain open . among them :    * how are jets launched , accelerated , collimated , and confined ? * of what are the jets composed ? *",
    "where in the jet are the observed photons emitted ? * what are the details of the emission mechanisms",
    "?    gamma - rays are our best tool for probing the most extreme processes within agn , and coordinated multiwavelength observations are crucial to the interpretation of gamma - ray data .      since late 2007",
    ", we have undertaken a continuous , fast - cadence ( twice weekly per source ) monitoring program beginning with the systematically - selected sample of 1158 blazars north of @xmath1 from the candidate gamma - ray blazar survey ( cgrabs )  @xcite .",
    "the sample has grown to more than 1550 sources , including all 454 `` clean '' agn associations from the first - year _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) agn catalog ( 1lac )  @xcite .",
    "newly lat - detected agn are added to the sample as well .",
    "results for the cgrabs sample during the 20082009 period are presented and analyzed and the program is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "radio light curves for the cgrabs sample are available to the public for download from http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ovroblazars .",
    "to provide a robust measure of the amplitude of variability observed in a light curve , we introduced the _ intrinsic modulation index _ , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the standard deviation and mean that would be measured for a light curve using a noiseless receiver with perfect sampling . in @xcite we derive a likelihood method for estimating @xmath5 and its uncertainty from an observed light curve .",
    "unlike the various measures of variability amplitude commonly used in the literature , the intrinsic modulation index provides a rigorous measure of its uncertainty which is essential for statistical comparisons .",
    "we computed @xmath5 for each cgrabs source using two years of data in @xcite .",
    "using 3.2 years of data , we find that the intrinsic modulation index for each source is typically either consistent within uncertainties or is found to be larger with the longer data set .",
    "an examination of the sources with the most significant changes shows that the significant increases typically occur in sources that demonstrated no or little variability during the first two years and subsequently exhibited a major flare or change in brightness .",
    "this suggests that the two - year data set was simply not long enough to capture the full range of variability behavior of the sources .",
    "previous findings indicate that 46  year or longer timescales for flaring activity are common in blazars  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so further increases in the modulation indices are likely as the monitoring program continues .      in @xcite",
    ", we found strong ( @xmath6 ) evidence that the gamma - ray  loud subset of cgrabs ( i.e. , those sources that appeared in the 1lac catalog ) was , on average , more variable at 15  ghz than was the gamma - ray  quiet subset ( see figure  [ fig : gamma_nongamma ] ) .",
    "this trend persists in the longer data set with similar significance .",
    "this establishes the first rigorous demonstration of a connection between gamma - ray emission and radio variability amplitudes in blazars .",
    ", for the cgrabs in 1lac ( solid ) and not in 1lac ( dashed ) . the gamma - ray loud 1lac subset are 5.7% more variable on average , a @xmath6 significant difference . ]    in figure  [ fig : bll_vs_fsrq ] , we compare the two - year variability amplitudes for cgrabs sources identified as bl  lac objects with those identified as flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "the bl  lac objects are found to vary more strongly than the fsrqs with @xmath7 significance .",
    "a similar result is found with the longer data set for cgrabs sources .",
    "however , for the 1lac sample , using 3.2  years of data we find the bl  lac objects and fsrqs to be consistent with the same variability amplitude within @xmath8 ( see figure  [ fig : bll_vs_fsrq_1lac ] ) .",
    "further study of this effect in @xcite suggests that the gamma - ray  loud fsrqs are much more radio variable than gamma - ray  quiet fsrqs whereas bl  lac objects display similar radio variability whether or not gamma - ray  loud .     for the cgrabs bl  lac object ( solid ) and fsrq ( dashed ) subsamples .",
    "the bl  lac objects are 3.2% more variable on average , a @xmath7 significant difference . ]     for the 1lac bl  lac object ( black ) and fsrq ( red ) subsamples .",
    "the two distributions are consistent with equal variability at the @xmath9 level . ]      to examine the relationship between radio variability amplitude and redshift , we restrict our sample to the fsrqs .",
    "this is necessary because the lack of optical lines in bl  lac objects makes redshift determination difficult , resulting in @xmath10 or less redshift completeness in our sample .",
    "this also prevents the difference in variability already found between bl  lac objects and fsrqs from contaminating our comparison . in @xcite",
    ", we found an apparent trend of decreasing variability amplitude with increasing redshift , shown in figure  [ fig : m_vs_z ] .",
    "a comparison of bright ( @xmath11 ) fsrqs at @xmath12 with those at @xmath13 found the lower - redshift fsrqs to be more variable with @xmath14 significance  @xcite .    .",
    "error bars indicate the rms scatter within each bin . ]    while this trend continues with the 3.2  year cgrabs data , the significance of the difference is less with the additional data .",
    "we also find that fsrqs within the 1lac sample do not show a significant difference in variability between the high and low redshift subsamples ( figure  [ fig : z_high_low_1lac ] ) . in @xcite , we find that this significance continues to decrease with additional data , suggesting that this observed difference is likely spurious .",
    "if real , however , a number of competing effects must be removed to determine whether the observed trend reflects any intrinsic variability trend with redshift .    ,",
    "black ) and high ( @xmath13 , red ) redshift subsets of the bright ( @xmath11 ) 1lac fsrq sample .",
    "the apparent difference is not statistically significant . ]",
    "a major aim of the ovro monitoring program is the detailed cross - correlation of radio light curves with gamma - ray light curves from the lat .",
    "peaks in the cross - correlation function could identify the relative locations of gamma - ray and radio emission within a blazar jet .",
    "however , establishing the _ physical _ significance of an apparent correlation is a major challenge .",
    "typical methods for computing the significance of a cross - correlation peak do not account for correlation between points within each light curve and , as a result , seriously overestimate the significance of an apparent peak .",
    "we have developed a monte carlo method to evaluate the significance of apparent correlations more accurately .",
    "this method and early results are described in more detail in  @xcite and in max - moerbeck et al . in these proceedings .",
    "a detailed study of cross - correlation between ovro 15  ghz light curves and lat gamma - ray light curves is forthcoming  @xcite .",
    "blazars characteristically exhibit polarized radio emission which can reveal the configuration of the magnetic field in the synchrotron emission regions . as a result ,",
    "monitoring radio polarization in addition to intensity can add valuable information and provide an additional channel to study the relationship between emission in the radio and other bands . to this end , we have designed and begun construction of a new ku - band ( 15  ghz ) receiver , `` kupol , '' with both linear polarization and total intensity measurement capabilities . using a correlation receiver architecture and digital back - end",
    ", kupol provides 16  mhz spectral resolution over a total bandwidth from 1218  ghz using the same beam - differenced optical design as the current program .",
    "construction of kupol is nearly complete and commissioning is planned for early 2012 .",
    "we are actively and continuously monitoring a sample of more than 1550 blazars , including all _ fermi _ gamma - ray blazars north of @xmath1 twice per week at 15  ghz . we have rigorously demonstrated a connection between gamma - ray emission and the strength of radio variability in our sample , an important prerequisite for establishing the physical significance of correlations between radio and gamma - ray light curves .",
    "in addition , we have developed and begun applying a monte carlo method for accurately evaluating the statistical significance of apparent peaks in the discrete cross - correlation function between radio and gamma - ray light curves .",
    "in addition to continuing our monitoring program , we will soon deploy kupol , adding an increased bandwidth , spectral resolution , and linear polarization monitoring to our radio monitoring program .",
    "these tools and the ever growing data sets will enable detailed study of the connection between radio and gamma - ray emission in blazars .",
