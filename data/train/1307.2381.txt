    "in physical world , many systems , for example , power systems , digital communication networks , economic systems and ecological systems , can be seen as large - scale systems .",
    "generally , large - scale systems represent a class of dynamic systems with high dimensions and complex structures , and such systems are usually characterized by geographical separation . when economic cost and reliability of communication links have to been taken into account , the decentralized control scheme is useful  @xcite . in recent control literatures ,",
    "much attention has been given to decentralized control problems  @xcite .",
    "compared with centralized controllers , decentralized controllers are designed only using locally available information of the subsystems , which means a lower level of connectivity and communication costs .    during the past years , there has been quite a lot of attention devoted to the study of markovian jump linear systems  ( mjlss )  and some useful control theories for this class of systems have been developed , such as stabilization  @xcite , @xmath1 control  @xcite , @xmath0 control  @xcite , 2d systems  @xcite , singular systems  @xcite , and model reduction  @xcite .",
    "factually , large - scale systems are often subject to abrupt changes in their structures due to component failures or repairs , sudden environmental disturbances , changing subsystem interconnections , etc .",
    "these structural variations often lead to random variations of the system parameters . in these situations , the model of mjlss",
    "can be used to capture the abrupt changes and some study of large - scale systems using the model of mjlss can be seen in  @xcite . in the system setup ,",
    "the changes of operation modes in the large scale system are governed by a markov process , referred to as global mode process , while the subsystems of the large scale system have their own operation modes . due to the interaction of the subsystems ,",
    "the changes of subsystem operation modes are not necessarily markovian . in  @xcite , the controllers designed only using the state and mode information locally available within the subsystems are referred to as local mode dependent controllers .",
    "a local mode dependent controller changes its operation mode only when the corresponding subsystem changes its operation mode .",
    "the controllers studied in  @xcite , known as global mode dependent controllers , change their gains whenever any of the subsystems switches to a different mode .",
    "hence , compared with the global mode control scheme , the local mode control scheme can effectively reduce the number of control gains and remove undesirable transient dynamics .",
    "as the local mode processes for the subsystems is non - markovian , the local mode dependent controllers can not be obtained directly , but can be derived from the global ones , and the derivation can be seen in section -b of @xcite .    in the large - scale systems considered in this paper",
    ", there are two kinds of internal uncertainties affecting the dynamics of system considered in this paper , which are local uncertainties and interconnection uncertainties .",
    "the local uncertainties result from the existence of uncertain dynamics in each subsystem and the interconnection uncertainties result from the fact that the subsystems are interrelated and interact with each other . in this paper",
    "these uncertainties are assumed to satisfy integral quadratic constraints ( iqcs ) , which have been proven to be effective in a number of robust control problems , for example , see  @xcite .    in @xcite , with no exogenous disturbances entering the system , the authors considered the problem of decentralized stabilization and developed a sufficient condition to design local mode decentralized stabilizing controllers .",
    "however , the external disturbances are often unavoidable in more practical situations . apart from internal uncertainties , each subsystem of the large - scale system",
    "is also affected by exogenous input signals .",
    "this paper focuses on the problem of designing decentralized state feedback control laws to reduce the affect the disturbance input has on the controlled output in an @xmath0 sense , with the controllers designed using local system states and operation modes information .",
    "the purpose is to find controllers such that the closed - loop large - scale system is mean square stable ( mss ) and its @xmath0 norm is below a prescribed level .",
    "this study could be considered as a further development of the result of  @xcite .",
