    "one of the enigmas of modern particle physics is dark matter ( dm ) which , according to the recent survey of planck  @xcite , consists of @xmath7 26.8% of the total energy content of the universe .",
    "various astrophysical and cosmological observations  @xcite strongly suggest convincing hints of the existence of dark matter which is non - relativistic or cold in nature .",
    "the particle nature of dark matter is still unknown .",
    "the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are the most promising candidates for cold dark matter .",
    "the experimental techniques for the detection of dark matter for both direct and indirect cases are very challenging . in direct detection experiments ,",
    "the recoil energy of the target nucleus scattered off by dm particle is measured whereas the signatures of the annihilations of decays of dm particles such as charged particles , photons and neutrinos etc .",
    "are aimed to detect in indirect searches .",
    "the monochromatic line feature of such decay or annihilation products of dm are particularly significant in predicting the nature of dm particles .",
    "a huge variety of dm models in the framework of wimp scenario with masses of dm spanning from kev to tevs has been addressed in several literatures and their direct and indirect detection prospects have been widely studied  @xcite .",
    "recently an evidence of x - ray line of energy 3.55 kev with more than @xmath9 cl has been reported from the analysis of x - ray data of 73 galaxy clusters from xmm - newton observatory  @xcite .",
    "another group has also claimed a similar line ( 3.52 kev x - ray line at @xmath10 cl ) from the data of x - ray spectra of andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) and perseus cluster  @xcite .",
    "the galaxy clusters are assumed to contain huge amount of dm .",
    "thus the signal may have a possible origin related to dm .",
    "the observed line has been explained as decay of sterile neutrino dark matter ( @xmath11 ) with mass of the sterile neutrino @xmath12 kev and mixing angle @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "recently many other interesting ideas have been proposed to explain this line signal to come from dm  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino oscillation data  @xcite provide strong evidences for neutrino mass .",
    "the non - zero neutrino masses and evidences of dm give hints to the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the two beyond sm phenomenon , namely the origin of neutrino masses and the existence of cold dark matter may have a connection . in this work we focus on the simplest framework which invokes this idea of connecting both sectors",
    "has been proposed by ma  @xcite . in this model",
    "the neutrino masses are generated via radiative processes with only the dm particles in the loop .",
    "the right - handed neutrino which can be a possible dm candidate interacts with lepton doublets and hence dm in this scenario is leptophilic in nature . the imposed discreet @xmath5 symmetry on this model not only forbids the tree - level dirac mass terms but also assure a stable cold dm candidate .",
    "phenomenological prospects for dm in this model have been done in refs .",

    "we consider the case where the lightest right - handed neutrino ( @xmath0 ) is the cold dm candidate and the second lightest right - handed neutrino ( @xmath1 ) is nearly degenerated with the cold dm candidate .",
    "this situation provides rich phenomenology in direct detection of such dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "elastic scattering cross section for dm - nucleon interaction is suppressed in this case and inelastic scattering that occurs radiatively dominates .",
    "the transition from @xmath1 to @xmath0 gives rise to monochromatic photon with energy equal to the mass difference between the lightest and second lightest right - handed neutrinos .",
    "if the mass difference between @xmath1 and @xmath14 is of @xmath7 kev , then the recent observation of x - ray line can be accommodated in this beyond sm scenario .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "i the theoretical framework of the model is briefly discussed .",
    "explanation of the observed x - ray line in this model framework and a study of the constrained parameter space are done in the next section . in sec .",
    "iv a brief summery of this work and some conclusions are drawn .",
    "we consider the model proposed by ma  @xcite which is the extension of standard model with three gauge singlet right - handed neutrinos @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and and extra su(2)@xmath3 doublet scalar @xmath4 .",
    "the fields can be written as , @xmath15 the doublet scalar @xmath4 is assumed to obtain no vacuum expectation value and hence inert .",
    "an additional discreet @xmath5 symmetry is imposed on the model .",
    "the stability of the cold dark matter candidate in this model is guaranteed by this symmetry . not only that the tree - level dirac masses of neutrinos are forbidden for this additional @xmath5 symmetry .",

    "[ tab:1 ] .",
    "the lagrangian for the right - handed neutrinos , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) invariant under both sm gauge symmetry and @xmath5 symmetry can be written as , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent yukawa couplings , lepton doublet and the mass of the right - handed neutrino of type @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) respectively . in our following work @xmath24 and @xmath21 are chosen to be real without any loss of generality .",
    "the invariant scalar potential containing the higgs doublet @xmath25 and the additional su(2)@xmath3 doublet @xmath4 is given by , @xmath26 the tree - level dirac mass terms for neutrinos can not be generated since the vacuum expectation value of the doublet @xmath4 ( @xmath27 ) to chosen be zero .",

    "the presence of transition magnetic moment solely triggers such a decay process to occur .",
    "the expression of decay width for this process can be written as , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the energy of the emitted photon which is nothing but the mass difference between the lightest and the second lightest right handed neutrinos present in this framework .",

    "the calculated value of the decay width for the decay process of @xmath1 to @xmath0 and a photon from the observed x - ray line data is @xmath55 gev  @xcite .",

    "[ ndecay ] that to comply the observed data for x - ray line with the framework of this model , the absolute value of @xmath50 should be @xmath56 gev@xmath57 .",
    "the order of the value of @xmath58 is particularly important for studying the prospects of the direct detection of dark matter .",
    "the predicted value of @xmath58 from the recently reported x - ray line data is several orders of magnitude below from the current reach of various dm direct detection experiments  @xcite . as the mass of the dark matter in this model is the lightest right - handed neutrino with heavy mass possibly in the range from few hundreds of gev to few thousands of gev",
    ", the direct dm searches should probe these massive right - handed neutrinos in this mass range .",
    "the expression for @xmath50 in the present scenario can be written in terms of model parameters  @xcite as , @xmath59 @xmath60 is the mass eigenvalue of ordinary neutrino of flavour @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the electric charge of proton .",
    "the term @xmath63 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : mu12 ] is related to the phase difference , @xmath64 between the yukawa couplings @xmath65 and @xmath66 for flavour @xmath61 . for the matrix of yukawa couplings of eq .",

    "the function @xmath67 comes from loop integral and can be expressed as , @xmath68    considering masses of ordinary neutrinos are negligible with respect to that of @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath69 , the allowed parameter space for the model parameters , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath64 is obtained from the computed value of @xmath58 from 3.5 kev x - ray line data .   which is few hundreds of gev or more in this framework and hence the ratio , @xmath72 is @xmath73 the plot showing the variation of the parameters constrained from observed x - ray line data",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ param ] . in this plot",

    "the range of the constrained values of the phase factor , @xmath64 for those mass ratios ( @xmath77 ) spanning from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "the situation would have been slightly modified if one incorporate the precise values of mixing angles ( for example , non - zero @xmath46 ) .",
    "the yukawa matrix structure is then modified and the phase factor for each flavour @xmath61 will be different in general .",
    "but it can be shown that for such cases the the order of the sum of the phase factors will be almost of similar order that has been obtained in this case .",
    "the phase factor determines the coannihilation of @xmath80 and the effective interaction of right - handed neutrino dm with nuclei .",
    "the result shows the values of phase factor @xmath64 with much smaller orders for the considered mass range than expected to be give signatures of direct detection .",
    "hence the coannihilation channels and the dm - nuclei interaction is much lowered from the computed value of @xmath64 constrained by the 3.5 kev x - ray line data .",
    "thus the possibility of direct detection of dark matter in this framework is suppressed by few orders from the reach of ongoing direct dm search experiments .",
    "we have shown that the radiative neutrino mass model can explain the observed 3.5 kev x - ray line signal from the data of various galaxy clusters and andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) .",
    "this model can accommodate naturally both neutrino mass and stable cold dark matter candidate .",
    "the small mass difference between the lightest and the second lightest right - handed neutrino have been considered to produce the energy of the x - ray signal .",
    "thus the transition from @xmath81 due to transition magnetic moment via radiative processes involving leptons and charged scalar in internal lines can naturally accommodate all the requirements for the x - ray line signal .",
    "the value of the transition magnetic moment ( @xmath50 ) for such an observed signal is estimated to be few orders of magnitude smaller than the reach of recent dm direct direct detection experimental limits sustaining the possibility of the cold dm candidate in this model to be detected directly .",
    "the other parameters of this model , namely masses of lightest right - handed neutrino ( @xmath0 ) , doublet scalar ( @xmath4 ) and phase factor ( @xmath64 ) between yukawa couplings , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are further constrained from the observed x - ray line data . a very small but non - zero value of the phase difference between yukawa couplings , @xmath82 and @xmath83 have been predicted .",
    "also the coannihilation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is reduced and the s - wave contribution of dark matter annihilation cross section is calculated to be reduced . finally the analysis performed here for this model framework would be viable for any dm signal in this energy regime .",
    "in addition the dark matter candidate ( lightest right - handed neutrino ) , being leptophilic and massive , can potentially explain ams-02 positron excess .",
