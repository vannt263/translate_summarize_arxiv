    "the study of dynamics of opinion formation is nowadays a hot topic in the statistical physics of complex systems , with a considerable amount of papers published in the last years ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "even simple models can exhibit an interesting collective behavior that emerges from the microscopic interaction among individuals or agents in a given social network .",
    "usually those models exhibit nonequilibrium phase transitions and rich critical phenomena , which justifies the interest of physicists in the study of opinion dynamics @xcite .    in the last few years , a recent attention has been done to the kinetic exchange opinion models ( keom ) @xcite , inspired in models of wealth exchange @xcite .",
    "the lccc model was the first one to consider kinetic exchanges among pairs of agents that present continuous states ( opinions ) @xcite . in this case",
    ", the model presents a continuous symmetry - breaking phase transition .",
    "after that , some extensions were analyzed for continuous and discrete opinions .",
    "for example , the inclusion of competitive interactions @xcite , three - agents interactions @xcite , dynamic self - confidence @xcite , presence of inflexible agents @xcite , and others , similarly to was done previously in other opinion dynamics , like the galam s models @xcite . in all these extensions the critical behavior of the system was extensively analyzed .",
    "dynamics of decision - making has been treated in several works in psychology @xcite and neuroscience @xcite . for the dynamics of opinion formation",
    ", we find many models by physicists dedicated to explain the decision - making process or the exchange of opinion through interactions among agents @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms consider kinetic exchanges ( keom @xcite ) , imitation ( voter model @xcite , sznajd model @xcite ) or the power of local majorities ( majority - rule model @xcite , majority - vote model @xcite ) , among others .",
    "nevertheless , the inclusion of noise and disorder can be considered in such models @xcite .",
    "usually discrete opinion models consider two distinct positions or opinions @xmath5 ( yes or no , democrat or republican , candidate a or candidate b ) .",
    "they can be enriched with the inclusion of a third state , @xmath6 , representing neutral state or indecision .",
    "indecision is a current and rising phenomenon which affects both recent and consolidated democracies @xcite .",
    "many reasons can lead an individual to become neutral or undecided , for example it can be associated to an anticonformism / nonconformism to the proposals on both sides of the debate . the impact of indecision / neutrality was considered recently in many works @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider a discrete keom in the presence of noise and disorder .",
    "in addition to pairwise random interactions , we introduce an indecision noise that significantly affects the dynamics of the system .",
    "our aim is to analyze the critical behavior of the model . in this case ,",
    "based on analytical and numerical results , we found three distinct phase transitions , namely the usual ferro - paramagnetic transition , and two distinct transitions to an absorbing state : from the ferromagnetic state and from the paramagnetic one .",
    "we considered a keom @xcite with competitive positive / negative interactions .",
    "our artificial society is represented by @xmath7 individuals in a fully - connected graph .",
    "each agent @xmath8 can be in one of three possible opinions at each time step @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 or @xmath2 .",
    "this general scheme can represent a public debate with two distinct choices , for example _ yes _ and _ no _ , and also including the undecided / neutral state .",
    "the following microscopic rules control our model :    1 .",
    "we choose two agents at random , say @xmath8 and @xmath11 , in a way that @xmath11 will try to persuade @xmath8 ; 2 .   with probability @xmath12 ,",
    "the opinion of agent @xmath8 in the next step @xmath13 is updated according to the kinetic rule @xmath14 $ ] ; 3 .   with probability @xmath4 ,",
    "the agent @xmath8 spontaneously change to the neutral state , i.e. , @xmath15 .    in the above dynamic rule , sgn(x )",
    "is the signal function defined such that sgn(0)=0 .",
    "this is usual in keom , in order to keep all the agents opinions in one the three possible ones , @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the pairwise couplings @xmath16 are quenched random variables does not affect our results , they can also be considered as annealed variables . ]",
    "that follows the discrete probability distribution @xmath17 . in other words",
    ", the parameter @xmath3 stands for the fraction of negative interactions .",
    "as discussed in previous works @xcite , the consideration of such negative interactions produces an effect similiar to the introduction of galam s contrarians in the population @xcite .",
    "in addition , competitive interactions were also considered for the modelling of coalition forming @xcite .",
    "the probability @xmath4 acts as a noise in the system , and it allows an autonomous decision of an individual to become neutral @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as the volatility of some individuals , who tend to spontaneously change their choices . in a two - candidate election",
    ", if a given individual does not agree with the arguments of supporters of both sides , he / she can decide to not vote for any candidate , and in this case he / she becomes neutral . in this case",
    ", this indecision noise must be differentiated / disassociated from other usual kinds of noises because , unlike the others , it privileges only the neutral opinion . as a recent example , in the 2012 usa election barack obama and mitt romney disputed for the election for president as the main candidates .",
    "it was reported that two months out from election day , nearly a quarter of all registered voters are either undecided about the presidential race or iffy in their support for a candidate , as indicated by polls @xcite .    for @xmath18 ,",
    "i.e. , in the absence of noise , the model undergoes a nonequilibrium order - disorder ( or ferro - paramagnetic ) transition at a critical fraction @xmath19 @xcite . in the ordered ferromagnetic phase ,",
    "one of the extreme opinions @xmath0 or @xmath1 dominates the population , whereas in the disordered paramagnetic phase the three opinions coexist with equal fractions ( @xmath20 ) .    at this point , some definitions are necessary .",
    "the order parameter of the system can be defined as @xmath21 that is the `` magnetization per spin '' of the system , and @xmath22 stands for average over disorder or configurations , computed at the steady states .",
    "let us also define @xmath23 and @xmath24 as the stationary fractions or densities of opinions @xmath25 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
