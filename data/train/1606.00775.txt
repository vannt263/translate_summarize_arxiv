    "rare ( semi-)leptonic decays induced by @xmath4 flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions are highly suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) and therefore sensitive to effects from non - standard interactions .",

    "further significant improvements in the precision of the measurements are expected in the ongoing lhc run and the lhcb upgrade  @xcite , as well as future machines  @xcite .    to fully exploit the forthcoming measurements it requires sufficient understanding of the long - distance backgrounds within the sm and/or the methods to disentangle them from the short - distance effects that might carry information about beyond - the - standard - model ( bsm ) physics .",
    "the non - perturbative qcd dynamics in the matrix elements of the local quark currents between the initial and final meson states is parameterised by hadronic transition form factors .",
    "the latter can be computed in the region of low hadronic recoil , which is the focus of this work , in the framework of lattice qcd .",

    "one such tool is the low recoil operator product expansion ( ope ) , in which the effects of the non - local matrix elements of the four - quark operators can be computed in terms of local matrix elements in powers of @xmath10  @xcite . here",

    "while the narrow resonances are removed by kinematic cuts and are not directly relevant at low recoil anyway , the wiggles , observed in @xmath21 decays  @xcite , constitute a background not captured locally by the ope . since the local resonance structure is a non - perturbative effect , it is not revealed at any order of the perturbative ope .",
