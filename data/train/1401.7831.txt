    "we experimentally demonstrate a vortex - phase filtering technique for extracting the centroid and spatial extent of an unresolved source distribution @xcite .",

    "applications of vortex phase elements span many areas of imaging science including optical spatial filtering @xcite , phase contrast microscopy @xcite , and high - contrast astronomical imaging @xcite .",
    "the latter makes use of an optical vortex coronagraph ( ovc ) .",
    "the ovc is a fourier filtering instrument wherein a focal plane vortex phase element acts to spatially separate light originating from a distant point source that coincides with the optical axis from nearby off - axis sources .",
    "consequently , the ovc is adept at small - angle high - contrast astronomical observations of stars @xcite and exoplanets @xcite .",
    "the optical design demonstrated here is adopted from a recently introduced broadband scalar ovc @xcite .",
    "this design incorporates a computer generated vortex hologram and a complementary dispersion compensating diffraction grating to form a vortex - phase filtering instrument that may be used with white light @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate using the broadband scalar ovc to determine the spatial extent of unresolved sources in the laboratory .",
    "this technique leverages the remarkable sensitivity of the ovc to the angular position of point sources near the optical axis of the system .",

    "but the entrance pupil plane is reimaged twice . the vh shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) is placed at the first focal plane of the ovc optical system [ see fig 4(b ) ] .",
    "the light that emerges from the vh in the first diffracted order contains the desired @xmath13 vortex phase pattern .",
    "in addition , the light in the first order is dispersed in the transverse plane by an angle that depends on the wavelength .",
    "the field at the first focal plane is reimaged onto a diffraction grating ( dg ) , whose line spacing matches that of the vh .",
    "the second grating compensates for the dispersion introduced by the vh in the first diffracted order without modifying the vortex phase .",
    "the result is a broadband ovc wherein the field magnitude at the final pupil plane is proportional to that of the simplified system described in fig . 1 .    to demonstrate the optical system illustrated in fig .",
    "4 in the laboratory , white light ( @xmath32 to @xmath33 ) from a fiber - coupled plasma source ( energetiq eq-99fc ) is collimated by an off - axis parabolic mirror oap and is subsequently focused onto a small pinhole by lens l0 ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .",

    "an evenly illuminated entrance pupil forms an airy disk that is centered on the central dislocation of a vh with @xmath31 pitch .",
    "the vh fabricated for this demonstration approximates the forked interference pattern with a @xmath30 binary amplitude grating printed by a laser lithographic technique at @xmath44 resolution on a @xmath45 thick fused silica plate [ see fig 3(b ) ] .",
    "we approach a point phase singularity by choosing a small aperture and long focal length @xmath46 ( effectively @xmath47 ) .",
    "this ensures the central feature is much smaller than the focal spot size .",
    "the central lobe of the airy disk covers approximately @xmath48 and @xmath49 line pairs for the red and blue bands , respectively .",

    "the recombined beam passes through field lens l5 ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) and forms the final pupil plane at the ccd with a central detected wavelength of 550 nm .",
    "the image of the entrance aperture appears if the pinhole is displaced from the optical axis [ see fig .",
    "4(c ) ] . however , if the center of the pinhole is aligned with the optical axis , most of the light is relocated outside of the geometric image of ap [ see fig .",
    "the transmission of the ovc optics ( from ap to the ls ) is @xmath51 .",
    "this could be enhanced by use of a blazed or volume hologram and grating .",
    "we define the relative suppression of an extended source as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the irradiance at the ccd .",
    "we note that the suppression is defined relative to the @xmath55 case and was calculated from the signal present in the central region of the ccd image with the background signal from scattering removed .",
    "the background is taken to be a constant , evaluated by averaging the counts in a dark region far from the optical axis ( i.e. in an annulus with inner and outer diameter @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "the interior power @xmath58 is integrated over the inner half of the geometric exit pupil radius to avoid contributions from optical aberration ( i.e. @xmath16 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath59 is obtained by measuring the power with the source substantially displaced from the optical axis .",
    "we measure a maximum suppression of @xmath60 with an on - axis pinhole source whose angular extent is @xmath61 over a @xmath62 passband ( @xmath63 band centered at @xmath64 ) .",
    "the nonzero value of @xmath65 is partly attributed to the extended size of the pinhole source .",
    "in cases where the structure of an unresolved source distribution is difficult to discern by conventional imaging , a non - imaging vortex - phase filtering approach may be employed to extract spatial information .",
    "an ideal ovc removes the zero spatial frequency component of a field distribution with constant irradiance across the aperture . in other words",
    ", the ovc completely cancels a distant on - axis point source .",
    "meanwhile , point sources that are minutely displaced from the optical axis are only partially suppressed .",
    "since small differences in source position yield a large transmission response , the ovc is sensitive to extended , yet unresolvable , source distributions @xcite . in the scheme employed here ,",
    "the centroid and angular extent of a spatially incoherent distribution are determined .",
    "we demonstrate the @xmath13 case ; however , other nonzero even values of @xmath6 may be used in principle to make similar measurements .",

    "4 , we measured @xmath65 in the laboratory for pinhole sources with various effective angular extents @xmath1 as a function of the angular position of the source centroid @xmath0 [ see fig .",
    "5 ] . for experimental convenience , we chose to displace the vh transverse to the optical axis rather than the pinhole [ see fig .",
    "shifting the center of the vh with respect to the focal spot is theoretically equivalent to displacing the pinhole from the optical axis .",
    "the values of @xmath65 are calculated from the ccd images at the exit pupil with the background signal from scattering removed .",
