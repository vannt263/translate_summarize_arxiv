    "i met henry kandrup as a graduate student at maryland in 1985 , having recently decided to switch from experiment to theory .",
    "my first interaction with postdocs  at the time an intimidatingly higher form of life  occurred when henry suggested that he and another postdoc , ping yip , and i take up the question of landau damping and stability of star clusters . while i was happy to work with henry and ping , most of the time i was struggling to understand cryptic conversations laced with mathematical jargon ",
    "`` functions of compact support , '' `` consider the following inner product , '' and so on . since i was nt following too much of this , i decided it was better to go away and catch up by reading every paper that was even vaguely related to the topic .",
    "this turned out to be much easier than expected , and one night i came up with a simple way of combining henry s previous work on stability with conventional landau damping theory from plasma physics . coming in to the department late in the morning",
    "i showed the first set of notes to henry .",
    "he looked at them , did not say much  which was unusual  and went back home .",
    "next day , as i entered my office , i was stunned to find , slipped under the door , a complete preprint of a paper , all equations written in by hand in henry s beautiful copperplate .",
    "he had gone home , generalized my notes to the problem at hand , worked through the entire thing , come back late at night , and typed the preprint on an electric typewriter ( this was just before the advent of word processing ) , finishing as the sun came up . after this incident , i was _ really _ afraid of postdocs !",
    "my early interactions with henry were very wide - ranging ; we discussed all sorts of topics , from classical statistical mechanics to quantum gravity , and on all of them he was very well - informed and entertainingly opinionated .",
    "the years went by quickly , henry moved on to other places and so did i. although we argued and collaborated now and then as of old , in my memory the early years have a certain luminescence .",
    "my favorite remembrance of henry is that after he had demolished somebody s hapless piece of research in one of our discussions , he would look up , smile in a disarming way , and say , `` true ? '' it usually was .",
    "one of the topics henry and i discussed at considerable length and depth was the nature of chaos in multi - particle systems and its role in controlling aspects of the dynamical behavior of statistical averages . while we did not always agree , these discussions certainly attuned my thinking about the problem . in this contribution",
    ", i present a discussion of how to think about chaos in a physical way , from the point of view of realistic experiments .",
    "the basis of the arguments applies to both classical and quantum systems and serves to bring together these two great dynamical traditions that are seemingly at such odds with each other .",
    "the work reported here is the result of several collaborations between subsets of the authors .",
    "while i do not know what henry s opinions would have been on this subject , however , i am sure he would not have been quiet !",
    "in classical theory  unlike in quantum mechanics ",
    "the status of dynamical chaos is apparently clear : chaos exists observationally and is well - described theoretically by newton s equations .",
    "( nevertheless , even here , a deeper look at the physical meaning of chaos is certainly helpful ; we return to this presently . )",
    "it is in the context of quantum theory , however , that the notion of chaos appears so puzzling and mysterious .",
    "because of the kosloff - rice theorem  @xcite and related results  @xcite , it is clear that quantum evolution of the wave function or the density matrix is integrable ; hence , chaos can not exist in quantum mechanics in the canonical sense .",
    "this is the basic stumbling block to defining a quantum notion of nonintegrability .",
    "one may argue that real quantum systems are always coupled to an environment and hence their evolution  `` for all practical purposes , '' ( fapp ) , in bell s famous phrase  @xcite  should be described by unitarity - breaking master equations rather than the unitary evolution assumed by the kosloff - rice theorem .",
    "perhaps this way out , although not fundamentally satisfying to the purist , is enough by itself , but it is easy to see what is wrong with the argument .",
    "fundamentally , any fully quantum dynamical description must arise from a hamiltonian describing the system , its environment , and their coupling .",
    "the master equation represents the evolution of the reduced density matrix for the system which arises from tracing over the environment variables in the full ( system plus environment ) density matrix .",
    "since the full evolution must satisfy kosloff - rice , the evolution of the reduced density matrix can not be nonintegrable .",
    "thus , the fundamental problem we are faced with is this : we are familiar with chaos in the real world , but our fundamental theory of dynamics  which passes every experimental test beautifully  seemingly does not have a natural place within it to tolerate even the existence of the concept .",
    "this should not come as a surprise ; after all , the trajectories of classical mechanics are apparently `` real '' and effortless to contemplate , but they too , have no natural place in quantum mechanics .",
    "now it is true that quantum mechanics is an intrinsically probabilistic theory , but that , in itself , is not the real issue .",
    "classical theory can be easily cast as fundamentally probabilistic as well , via the classical liouville equation describing the evolution of a classical probability in phase space .",
    "( for an attempt at an even closer analogy , see ref .",
    "@xcite and the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) as discussed further below , the key point is rather that , unlike special relativity , where @xmath0 smoothly transitions between einstein and newton , the limit @xmath1 is singular . the symmetries underlying quantum and classical dynamics  unitarity and symplecticity , respectively  are fundamentally incompatible with the opposing theory s notion of a physical state : quantum - mechanically , a positive semidefinite density matrix ; classically , a positive phase - space distribution function .    in the rest of this article",
    ", we will expose the singular nature of the @xmath1 limit and discuss a physical point of view ",
    "applicable to both classical and quantum systems  which will enable us to explain how trajectories and chaos appear in real experiments .    at this point",
    ", it should be clear that the questions taken up in this contribution are not those usually considered under the research area called `` quantum chaos . '' there , one is primarily interested in the quantum behavior of a system with a classically chaotic hamiltonian , what might happen to the validity of certain approximations ( e.g. , semiclassical approaches to calculating the quantum propagator ) and whether classical trajectories and phase space structures can provide some insight into the nature of quantum wavefunctions .",
    "but one does not actually study quantum chaos .",
    "we distinguish between _ isolated _ evolution , where the system state evolves without any coupling to the external world , _ unconditioned open _",
    "evolution , where the system evolves coupled to an external environment but where no information regarding the system is extracted from the environment , and _ conditioned open _",
    "evolution where such information _ is _ extracted . in the third case , the evolution of the physical state is driven by the system evolution , the coupling to the external world , and by the fact that observational information regarding the state has been obtained .",
    "this last aspect ",
    "system evolution _ conditioned _ on the measurement results via bayesian inference  leads to an intrinsically nonlinear evolution for the system state , and distinguishes it from unconditioned evolution .",
    "while the concept of conditioned evolution of the system state is familiar to engineers and mathematicians , especially systems engineers and control theorists  @xcite , it is not yet completely familiar territory to the majority of physicists . nevertheless , driven by the impressive progress in the experimental state - of - the - art in quantum and atomic optics and in nanoscience  @xcite ,",
    "these notions are now being employed as everyday tools at least in some fields .",
    "the conditioned evolution provides , in principle , the most realistic possible description of an experiment . to the extent that quantum and classical mechanics are eventually just methodological tools to explain and predict the results of experiments ,",
    "this is the proper context in which to compare them and discuss the nature of predictions for real experiments .",
    "the explicit incorporation of information gained via measurement also provides a structure to address the quantum - classical transition more generally , and to frame the question of where chaos exists within this structure .",
    "the fact that quantum and classical mechanics are fundamentally incompatible in many ways , yet the macroscopic world is well - described by classical dynamics has puzzled physicists ever since the laying of the foundations of quantum theory .",
    "it is fair to say that not everyone is satisfied with the state of affairs  including many seasoned practitioners of quantum mechanics .    of course , the notion of measurement in quantum mechanics  the denial of reality to system properties unless they are measured  is such a revolutionary concept that it engenders much more unease  @xcite , even today .",
    "the problem is that , were quantum mechanics the final theory , it could deny reality to the measurement results themselves unless they were observed by another system and so on , _ ad infinitum_. in order to `` solve '' the `` measurement problem , '' it originally appeared impossible to think of quantum mechanics as a fundamental theory without relying on the existence of a classical world - view within which to embed it  @xcite .",
    "although we still can not dispel the unease invoked by the measurement problem , it is important to stress that the quantum - classical transition can be understood independently .",
    "this transition should not be confused with the measurement problem .",
    "a partial understanding of the classical limit arises from the idea  familiar from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics  that weak interactions of a system with an environment are universal  @xcite .",
    "these interactions can effectively suppress certain nonclassical terms in the quantum evolution  @xcite .",
    "however , at best they only allow for the emergence of a classical probabilistic evolution and it can be shown that the mere existence of such interactions is insufficient to yield classical evolution in all cases  @xcite .",
    "finally , this picture alone can not explain the results of actual measurements where information can be continuously extracted from the environment and used to define operational notions of a trajectory .",
    "we now go in to these questions in more detail .",
    "suppose we are given an arbitrary system hamiltonian @xmath2 in terms of the dynamical variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; we will be more specific regarding the precise meaning of @xmath3 and @xmath4 as position and momentum later .",
    "the hamiltonian is the generator of time evolution for the physical system state , provided there is no coupling to an environment or measurement device . in the classical case , we specify the initial state by a positive phase space distribution function @xmath5 ; in the quantum case , by the ( position - representation ) positive semidefinite density matrix @xmath6 or , completely equivalently , by the corresponding wigner distribution function @xmath7 ( not positive ) .",
    "the wigner distribution  @xcite is a `` half - fourier '' transform of @xmath6 , defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the evolution of an _ isolated _ system is then given by the classical and quantum liouville equations for the _ fine - grained _ distribution functions ( i.e. , the evolution is entropy - preserving ) : @xmath11 f_{cl}(x , p ) , \\label{cle}\\ ] ] @xmath12 f_w(x , p ) \\nonumber\\\\   & & + \\sum_{\\lambda = 1}^\\infty\\frac{(\\hbar/2i)^{2\\lambda}}{(2\\lambda + 1 ) ! }",
    "\\partial_x^{2\\lambda+1}v(x ) \\partial_p^{2\\lambda+1 } f_w(x , p ) , \\label{qle } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed for simplicity that the potential @xmath13 can be taylor - expanded ; this does not alter the nature of any of the following arguments .",
    "note that these evolutions are both linear in the respective distribution functions .",
    "the limiting form @xmath14 is allowed classically , and , on substitution in eqn .",
    "( [ cle ] ) , yields the expected newton s equations .",
    "these may then be interpreted as equations for the particle position and momentum , although we must emphasize that this identification is only formal at this stage .",
    "quantum mechanically , this ultralocal limit is not permitted since @xmath7 must be square - integrable , therefore  even formally  no direct particle interpretation can exist . in both cases , if one allows for initially localized distributions but which nevertheless have some finite width , it is easy to see that if @xmath13 is nonlinear , quite generically the distribution will eventually spread over the allowed phase space and not remain localized .",
    "as alluded to in the introduction , the extension to open systems is conceptually trivial , but very difficult to implement in practice . to the original system hamiltonian , we now add pieces representing the environment and the system - environment coupling .",
    "if the environment is in principle unobservable , then a ( nonlocal in time ) linear master equation for the system s reduced density matrix is  in theory ",
    "derivable by tracing over the environmental variables . in practice ,",
    "tractable equations are impossible to obtain without drastic simplifying assumptions such as weak coupling , timescale separations , and simple forms for the environmental and coupling hamiltonians . in any case , the important point to note is that the act of tracing over the environment does not change the linear nature of the equations . generally speaking",
    ", master equations describing open evolution of _ coarse - grained _ distributions augment the rhs of eqns .",
    "( [ cle ] ) and ( [ qle ] ) with terms containing dissipation and diffusion kernels connected via generalized fluctuation - dissipation relations  @xcite .",
    "while the classical diffusion term vanishes in the limit of zero temperature for the environment , this is not true quantum mechanically due to the presence of zero - point fluctuations .",
    "in contrast to classical theory , where measurement can be , in principle , a passive process , in quantum theory measurement creates an irreducible disturbance on the observed system ( quantum `` backaction '' ) .",
    "this being so , if our aim is that measurement yield dynamical information  rather than strongly influence dynamics  the desired measurement process must yield a limited amount of information in a finite time .",
    "hence , simple projective ( von neumann ) measurements are clearly not appropriate because they yield complete information instantaneously via state projection .",
    "nevertheless , this fundamental notion of measurement can be easily extended  @xcite to devise schemes that extract information continuously  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to have the system of interest interact weakly with another ( e.g. , atom interacting with an electromagnetic field ) and make projective measurements on the auxiliary system ( e.g. , photon counting ) .",
    "because of the weak interaction , the state of the auxiliary system gathers very little information regarding the system of interest , and therefore this system , in turn , is only perturbed slightly by the measurement backaction .",
    "only a small component of the information gathered by the projective measurement of the auxiliary system relates to the system of interest , and a continuous limit of the measurement process can be taken .    in the continuous limit",
    ", the evolution of the system density matrix is fundamentally different from the equations discussed above for the case of open evolution .",
    "the master equation describing the evolution of the reduced density matrix conditioned on the results of the measurements contains a term that reflects the gain in information arising from the measurement record ( `` innovation '' in the language of control theory ) .",
    "this term , arising from applying a continuous analog of bayes theorem , is intrinsically nonlinear in the distribution function .",
    "the coupling to an external probe ( and the associated environment ) will also cause effects very similar to the open evolution considered earlier , and there can once again be dissipation and diffusion terms in the evolution equations .",
    "the primary differences between the classical and quantum treatments , aside from the kinematic constraints on the distribution functions , are the following : ( i ) the ( nonlocal in @xmath4 ) quantum evolution term in eqn .",
    "( [ qle ] ) , and ( ii ) an irreducible diffusion contribution due to quantum backaction reflecting the _ active _ nature of quantum measurements .",
    "we now consider a simple model of position measurement to provide a measure of concreteness . in this model",
    ", we will assume that there are no environmental channels aside from those associated with the measurement .",
    "suppose we have a single quantum degree of freedom , position in this case , undergoing a weak , ideal continuous measurement  @xcite . here",
    "`` ideal '' refers to no loss of information during the measurement , i.e. , a fine - grained evolution with no increase in entropy .",
    "then , we have two coupled equations , one for the measurement record @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the infinitesimal change in the output of the measurement device in time @xmath18 , the parameter @xmath19 characterizes the rate at which the measurement extracts information about the observable , i.e. , the _ strength _ of the measurement  @xcite , and @xmath20 is the wiener increment describing driving by gaussian white noise  @xcite , the difference between the actually observed value and that expected .",
    "the other equation  the nonlinear stochastic master equation ( sme )  specifies the resulting conditioned evolution of the system density matrix , given in the wigner representation , @xmath21\\right .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left.dt\\sum_{\\lambda = 1}^\\infty \\ !",
    "\\frac{\\left ( \\hbar/2i\\right)^{2\\lambda}}{(2\\lambda + 1 ) ! }   \\partial_x^{2\\lambda+1 }   v(x , t ) \\partial_p^{2\\lambda+1 } \\right ] f_w(x , p , t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + dt\\sqrt{8k}(x - \\langle x \\rangle)f_w(x , p , t)dw ,   \\label{condq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the diffusion coefficient arising from quantum backaction and the last ( nonlinear ) term represents the conditioning due to the measurement . in principle , there is also a ( generalized ) damping term  @xcite , but if the measurement coupling is weak enough , it can be neglected .",
    "if we choose to average over all the measurement results , which is the same as ignoring them , then the conditioning term vanishes , but _ not _ the diffusion from the measurement backaction .",
    "thus the resulting linear evolution of the coarse - grained quantum distribution is not the same as the linear fine - grained evolution  ( [ qle ] ) , but yields a conventional open - system master equation .",
    "moreover , for a given ( coarse - grained ) master equation , different underlying fine - grained sme s may exist , specifying different measurement possibilities .",
    "in contrast to the quantum case , the corresponding ( ideal ) classical conditioned master equation [ set @xmath23 in eqn .",
    "( [ condq ] ) , holding @xmath19 fixed ] , @xmath24\\right]f_{cl}(x , p , t ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + dt \\sqrt{8k}(x - \\langle x \\rangle)f_{cl}(x , p ,",
    "t)dw , \\label{condc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] does not have the backaction term as these classical measurements are _ passive _ : averaging over all measurements simply gives back the liouville equation ( [ cle ] ) , and there is no difference between the fine - grained and coarse - grained evolutions in this special case .",
    "[ in general , classical diffusion terms from ordinary open evolution can also coexist , as in the _ a posteriori _ evolution specified by the kushner - stratonovich equation  @xcite , of which eqn .",
    "( [ condc ] ) is a special case . ] as a final point , we delay our discussion of how the classical trajectory limit is incorporated in eqn .",
    "( [ condc ] ) , i.e. , the precise sense in which the `` the position of a particle is what a position - detector detects , '' to the next section .",
    "if quantum mechanics is really the fundamental theory of our world , then an effectively classical description of macroscopic systems must emerge from it  the so - called quantum - classical transition ( qct ) .",
    "it turns out that this issue is inextricably connected with the question of the physical meaning of dynamical nonlinearity discussed above . having written down the relevant evolution equations , we now analyze two notions of the qct and how they emerge from the equations .",
    "quantum mechanics is intrinsically probabilistic , but classical theory  as shown above by the existence of the delta - function limit for the classical distribution function  is not . since newton s equations provide an excellent description of observed classical systems , including chaotic systems , it is crucial to establish how such a localized , or trajectory , description can arise quantum mechanically .",
    "we will call this the _ strong _ form of the qct .",
    "of course , in many situations , only a statistical description is possible even classically , and here we demand only the agreement of quantum and classical distributions and the associated dynamical averages .",
    "this defines the _ weak _ form of the qct .",
    "it is clear that if the strong form of the qct holds , then , via trivial coarse - graining , the weak form follows automatically .",
    "the reverse is not true , however : results from a coarse - grained analysis can not be applied to the fine - grained situation .",
    "moreover , the violation of the conditions necessary to establish the strong form of the qct need not prevent the existence of a weak qct .",
    "we now discuss and establish the conditions under which these transitions occur . since the strong form of the qct requires treating the localized limit , a cumulant expansion for the distribution function immediately suggests itself , whereas , for the more nonlocal issues relevant to the weak form of the qct , a semiclassical analysis turns out to be natural .",
    "it is easy to see that the strong form of the qct is impossible to obtain from either the isolated or open evolution equations for the density matrix or wigner function .",
    "as mentioned already , for a generic dynamical system , a localized initial distribution tends to distribute itself over phase space  and then continue to evolve  either in complicated ways ( isolated system ) or asymptote to an equilibrium state ( open system ) , whether classically or quantum mechanically . in the case of conditioned evolution , however , the distribution can be localized due to the information gained from the measurement , and evolve in a quite different manner . in order to quantify how this happens , let us first apply a cumulant expansion to the ( fine - grained ) conditioned classical evolution  ( [ condc ] ) .",
    "this results in the following equations for the centroids ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 where @xmath28 along with a hierarchy of coupled equations for the time - evolution of the higher cumulants .",
    "these equations are the continuous measurement , real - world , analog of the formal ultralocal newtonian limit of the distribution function in the classical liouville equation  ( [ cle ] ) . whereas eqns .",
    "( [ cumc ] ) always apply , our aim is to determine the conditions under which the cumulant expansion effectively truncates and brings their solution very close to that of newton s equations",
    ". this will be true provided the noise terms are small ( in an average sense ) and the force term is localized , i.e. , @xmath29 , the corrections being small .",
    "the required analysis involves higher cumulants and has been carried out elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the distribution is localized provided @xmath30 and the motion of the centroid will effectively define a smooth classical trajectory  the low - noise condition  as long as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the action scale of the system .",
    "note that this condition does not bound the measurement strength : classically we can always extract as much information as needed  at least in principle  to gain the trajectory limit .",
    "this , then , is the `` realistic '' derivation of newton s equations .",
    "we now turn to the quantum version of these results . in this case",
    ", the analogous cumulant expansion gives exactly the same equations for the centroids as above , while the equations for the higher cumulants are different .",
    "( the evolution of classical and quantum averages is the same to gaussian order , with the first differences arising at the next order  @xcite .",
    ") we can again investigate whether a trajectory limit exists .",
    "localization holds in the weakly nonlinear case if the classical condition above is satisfied . in the case of strong nonlinearity ,",
    "the inequality becomes  @xcite @xmath33 because of the backaction , the low - noise condition is implemented in the quantum case by a double - sided inequality : @xmath34 where the action is measured in units of @xmath35 , @xmath36 being dimensionless .",
    "the left inequality is the same as the classical one discussed above , however the right inequality is essentially quantum mechanical .",
    "the measurement strength can not be made arbitrarily large as the backaction will result in too large a noise in the equations for the centroids . as the action @xmath36 is made larger , both inequalities are satisfied for an ever wider range of values of @xmath19 . for sufficiently large @xmath36 ,",
    "the actual value of @xmath19 becomes irrelevant and the dynamics becomes effectively classical .    to recapitulate , for continuously measured quantum systems , trajectories that emerge in the macroscopic limit follow newton s equations , and hence can be chaotic as shown elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "thus , as speculated in a prescient paper by chirikov  @xcite , measurement indeed provides the missing link between `` quantum '' and `` chaos , '' at least in the classical limit .",
    "finally , in experiments one usually considers the measurement record itself rather than the estimated state of the system as we have discussed so far . as",
    "measurement introduces a white noise , it is important to investigate the condition under which the record tracks the estimate faithfully . if @xmath37 is the time over which the continuous measurement is averaged to obtain the record ( this averaging being a necessary part of any finite - bandwidth experiment ) , and we allow ourselves a maximum of @xmath38 as the position noise , it is easy to see that the measurement strength needs to satisfy  @xcite @xmath39    to demonstrate these results for a concrete example , we revisit the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for a driven , duffing oscillator , with system hamiltonian @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "this hamiltonian has been used before in studies of quantum chaos  @xcite and quantum decoherence  @xcite and , in the parameter regime used , a substantial area of the accessible phase space is stochastic .     and @xmath46 .",
    "( b ) the position variance , @xmath47 , as a function of time .",
    "note the smallness of the scale on the y - axis!,width=321,height=283 ]    numerical calculations at various values of @xmath35 confirm that as @xmath35 is reduced , both the steady - state variance , and the resulting noise ( for optimal measurement strengths ) are reduced , as expected . as the dynamical time scale of this problem is @xmath48 ( in units of the driving period ) , the continuous observation record was averaged over a period of @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , as the range of the motion covers distances of @xmath50 , we demand that the position be tracked to an accuracy of @xmath49 to define an effective `` trajectory . '' to satisfy this , we need to have @xmath51 or larger [ cf .",
    "( [ kobs ] ) ] . in our example , we choose the energy to be @xmath52 , the corresponding typical action turns out to be @xmath50 , and the typical nonlinearity makes the rhs of eqn .",
    "[ klarge ] , @xmath53 .",
    "we see that a choice of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , satisfies all the constraints for a classical motion . in fig .",
    "[ fig00 ] we demonstrate that in this regime , localization is maintained along with low levels of trajectory noise .",
    "[ fig00](a ) shows a typical phase space trajectory , with the position variance during the evolution , @xmath56 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig00](b ) .",
    "we find that the width @xmath57 is always bounded by @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , as is immediately evident from the smoothness of the trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig00](a ) , the noise is also negligible on these scales .",
    "additionally , one can verify that the quantum trajectory evolution and that given by a classical trajectory with an equivalent noise are essentially identical  and chaotic  yielding a lyapunov exponent of @xmath59 .",
    "we return to discuss the lyapunov exponent later below .",
    "the weak form of the qct utilizes the _ coarse - grained _ distribution function ( averaging over all measurements ) , whereas the strong form refers to the _ fine - grained _",
    "distribution for a single measurement realization .",
    "it is important to reiterate that nonexistence of the strong form of the qct does not influence the existence of the weak form of the qct : it does not matter if the distribution is too wide , as long as the classical and quantum distributions agree , and , even if the backaction noise is large , the coarse - grained distribution can remain smooth and the weak quantum - classical correspondence still exist . consequently , this correspondence has to be approached in a different manner .",
    "in fact , the weak version is just another way to state the conventional decoherence idea  @xcite ; however , as discussed elsewhere  @xcite , mere suppression of quantum interference does not guarantee the qct even in the weak form .",
    "we now focus on a semiclassical analysis of the weak qct for bounded , classically chaotic open systems  @xcite .",
    "this analysis is best regarded as a _",
    "regularization _ of the singular @xmath60 limit via the environmental interaction .",
    "this is distinct from the state _ localization _ characteristic of the strong form of the qct . given a small , but finite , value of @xmath35 , the aim is to establish the existence of a timescale beyond which the dynamics of open quantum and classical systems becomes statistically equivalent if the environmental interaction is sufficiently strong .",
    "it has been demonstrated  @xcite that , for a bounded open system with a classically chaotic hamiltonian , the weak form of the qct is achieved by two parallel processes , both relying essentially on the existence of environmental diffusion .",
    "first , the semiclassical approximation for quantum dynamics , which breaks down for classically chaotic systems due to overwhelming nonlocal interference , is recovered as the environmental interaction filters these effects .",
    "second , environmental noise restricts the foliation of the unstable manifold , the set of points which approach a hyperbolic point in reverse time , allowing the semiclassical wavefunction to track this modified classical geometry . in this way",
    ", the noise prevents classical chaos from breaking the semiclassical approximation as @xmath1 , and thus regularizes this limit .",
    "note that this approach explicitly incorporates both the stretching and folding typical of hyperbolic regions as well as the role of the environment as a filter on a phase - space quantum distribution .",
    "we begin with a simple model of a quantum system weakly coupled to the environment so as to maintain complete positivity for the subsystem density matrix , @xmath61 , while subjecting it to a , time - local , unitarity - breaking interaction .",
    "these conditions mathematically constrain the master equation to be of the so - called lindblad form  @xcite .",
    "if this environmental interaction couples to the position , as is often the case , the master equation takes the form : @xmath62 where @xmath63 , the classical liouville operator , and @xmath64 , the quantum correction , can be easily identified from eqn .",
    "( [ qle ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that while the sum of @xmath63 and @xmath64 is clearly unitary , individually the operators are not unitary  @xcite . in this simple master equation ,",
    "we have neglected the dissipative environmental channel and kept the diffusive channel for two reasons : ( i ) the coupling to the environment is always assumed to be weak and the dissipative timescales are , hence , very long , longer than the dynamical timescales of interest , ( ii ) the weak form of the qct arises only from the diffusive channel , hence , dissipative effects are not of interest here .",
    "when @xmath65 , this equation reverts to the classical fokker - planck equation .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the specific form of the diffusion coefficient depends strongly on the physical situation envisaged .",
    "thus , if the master equation describes a weakly coupled , high temperature environment , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is the damping coefficient )  @xcite , whereas for a weak , continuous measurement of position , the diffusion due to quantum backaction is @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "the discussion below holds for all of these cases .",
    "once the qct occurs , the effects of @xmath69 in the evolution specified by eqn .",

    "this definition is the obvious generalization of the conventional ode definition to dynamical averages , where the noise is treated as a drive on the system . indeed , under the conditions when ( noisy ) classical motion emerges , and thus when localization holds , it reduces to the conventional definition , and yields the correct classical lyapunov exponent . to combat slow convergence",
    ", we measure the lyapunov exponent by averaging over an ensemble of finite - time exponents @xmath123 instead of taking the asymptotic long - time limit for a single trajectory .",
    "a key result now follows : in unobserved , i.e. , isolated quantum dynamical systems , it is possible to prove , by employing unitarity and the schwarz inequality , that @xmath72 vanishes ; the finite - time exponent , @xmath124 , decays away as @xmath125  @xcite . from the kosloff - rice theorem we know , of course , that the lyapunov exponent must be zero , since the overall evolution is integrable , but this result gives us a quantitative statement regarding the decay of the exponent .",

    "<S> finally , we have the striking prediction that time - series from measured quantum systems can be chaotic far from the classical regime , with lyapunov exponents differing from their classical values . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions can be tested in next - generation experiments . </S>"
