    "a general problem of astrophysics , also reappearing in heliospheric physics , is the structure of the contact discontinuity which is located between the reverse shock of a stellar wind and the counterstreaming interstellar medium .",
    "the contact discontinuity is called the heliopause or more generally the astropause . here",
    "not only two different flows are encountering , but also the electromagnetic fields transported by the flows .",
    "the aim of our work is to find magnetic field configurations in the vicinity of the stagnation point in the framework of mhd .",
    "similar work has already been done by @xcite .",
    "but their analysis used linearizations of the mhd  equations and their model was restricted to constant resistivities .",
    "introducing the streaming vector @xmath0 with @xmath1 and the electric potential @xmath2 one can write the resistive mhd equations in the following form    @xmath3     \\frac{\\partial\\left(\\zeta,\\alpha\\right)}{\\partial\\left(x , y\\right ) } & = &      \\frac{\\partial\\zeta}{\\partial x}\\,\\frac{\\partial\\alpha}{\\partial y } -     \\frac{\\partial\\zeta}{\\partial y}\\,\\frac{\\partial\\alpha}{\\partial x } =     \\sqrt{\\rho}\\left(r^{z } - e_{0}\\right)\\\\[0.2em ]      -b_{z } w_{p } & = &   \\sqrt{\\rho}\\left(r^{\\zeta } + w_{p}\\frac{\\partial\\phi_{e}}{\\partial\\zeta}\\right )       \\quad\\textrm{and}\\quad        w_{z } b_{p } = \\sqrt{\\rho}\\left(r^{\\alpha } + b_{p}\\frac{\\partial\\phi_{e}}{\\partial\\alpha } \\right )       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the components of the generalized resistivity with ohm s law given by @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the plama pressure .",
    "the potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 are functions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 only and are the streaming function respectively the magnetic flux function .",
    "the potential @xmath7 ensures the vanishing of the @xmath17-component of the lorentz force , which guarantees the vanishing of the @xmath17-component of the pressure gradient and therefore that the equilibrium is two - dimensional .",
    "thus , the potential @xmath7 induces the appropriate coupling between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the equations for incompressible stationary resistive mhd in 2d had been derived by @xcite , but without the relations for the components of the magnetic field and streaming vector in the invariant direction , which are derived in @xcite .",
    "our procedure follows mainly @xcite , however , we admit here of the @xmath17-component of the magnetic field and streaming vector .    to ensure the condition for magnetic field line freezing into the bulk plasma flow , one has to obey ohm s law and the induction equation @xmath20 derivations of this relation",
    "can be found in @xcite and references therein and in @xcite . for @xmath21",
    "this reduces to the well - known frozen - in field condition ( flux conserving flow ) .    in the stationary two - dimensional case",
    "the above criterion must be written as @xmath22 for the stationary two dimensional case .",
    "equation ( [ lico ] ) is equivalent to the critereon for line  freezing , which is given , e.g. by @xcite .        ; for @xmath23 the magnetic field would be exactly flow  aligned , if the shear components are zero.,width=302 ]    the term @xmath24 is the difference between the resistive term and the constant electric field @xmath25 in @xmath17direction would imply that the flow is purely field aligned ] .",
    "a simple case is @xmath26 which neglects resistive terms . assuming a standard stagnation point given by the flow field @xmath27 , which is shown in fig.1 , we are able to calculate a wide class of solutions of ideal ohm s law for the magnetic field by using the theory of characteristics",
    ". these solutions of ideal ohm s law are given by @xmath28 field lines of a special solution of the ohm s law around a standard stagnation point can be seen in fig.2 . where in this special case the constants @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are set to 1 and @xmath32 is set to -1 , which could represent the magnetic fields in the vicinity around a stagnation point of an astrosphere , where the flow vector @xmath33 vanishes at the `` nose '' ( i.e. stagnation point ) of the astropause .",
    "however , in the case of ideality ( @xmath34 ) the velocity field diverges , although @xmath35 remains finite , so that the `` stagnation point '' , is only a `` topological '' stagnation point . only for the field",
    "@xmath33 the origin is a stagnation point . here",
    "we have to choose the density to be zero on the separatrices to avoid magnetic singularities .",
    "therefore around the separatrices there must be a kind of a `` vacuum gap '' to ensure that the mass current density vector @xmath36 remains finite .",
    "this leads to a double separatrix structure of the magnetic field ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "so the constraint of `` idealness '' leads to a magnetic structure which is more complex then the underlying structure of the flow field .",
    "the class of solutions we found does not ensure that these are also solutions of the euler equation .",
    "it seems to be more probable , that stationary mhd equilibria , conserving magnetic flux , do not exist close to the standard stagnation point , at least not without other forces , e.g. pressure anisotropies .",
    "it seems that to date only for a constant resistivity two dimensional annihilation solutions ( without shear components ) have been found @xcite .",
    "so our ansatz gives a possibility for further investigations , to find non flux conserving , but line conserving solutions @xmath37 , so called annihilation solutions , as magnetic flux is annihilated .",
