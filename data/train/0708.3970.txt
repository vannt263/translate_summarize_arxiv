    "the existence of dark matter is one of the direct evidences of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , and supersymmetry ( susy ) is a strong candidate of such new physics .",
    "one the many virtues of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is that the lightest superpartner can serve as dark matter of the universe .",
    "the lightest neutralino of the mssm is an interesting and widely - explored candidate of dark matter ( @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and references therein ) . because of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , the lightest neutralino , @xmath1 , is linear combination of the bino ( @xmath2 ) , the wino ( @xmath3 ) , and the higgsinos ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "expressing @xmath1 as @xmath5 where @xmath6 are elements of the transformation matrix that diagonalizes the mssm neutralino mass matrix , there are several important limits of interest . in the higgsino - dominated ( @xmath7 ) and the wino - dominated ( @xmath8 ) limits , @xmath1 is typically nearly degenerate with either the charged higgsinos and/or the charged winos , and the efficient self- and co - annihilation processes leads to a relic density that is less than the wmap observation @xcite @xmath9 on the other hand , in the bino - dominated limit ( @xmath10 ) , the annihilation cross section is @xmath0-wave suppressed , and bino relic density is typically higher than the wmap observation .    for the relic density of @xmath1 to be consistent with current observations ,",
    "there typically requires fine - tunings of the mssm spectra such that one or more of the following occurs @xcite :    * enhanced co - annihilation between @xmath1 and another superpartner , typically the s - tau ( @xmath11 ) , when these two states are tuned to be nearly degenerate on the order of 1% . *",
    "enhanced @xmath12-channel resonance in the @xmath1 annihilation cross section when the mass of one of the higgs bosons is tuned to be close to twice the mass of @xmath1 . * enhanced annihilation cross section from the wino / higgsino mixture of @xmath1 and enhanced co - annihilation of the charginos when either the mass of the winos ( both neutral and charged ) or the higgsinos ( both neutral and charged ) is tuned to be close to the bino mass @xcite .",
    "the root of the problem is the @xmath0-wave suppression of the bino annihilation cross section due to the majorana nature of the bino . on the other hand ,",
    "dirac particles carrying @xmath13 or @xmath14 quantum numbers such as the kaluza - klein ( kk ) neutrino of the minimal universal extra dimension model @xcite@xcite are typically ruled out as dark matter by direct detection experiments such the cryogenic dark matter search ( cdms ii)@xcite and the xenon10 dark matter experiment @xcite .",

    "we would like a natural mechanism that enhances the annihilation cross section , and at the same time , is consistent with the bounds of direct detection .",
    "the pseudo - dirac bino is one such example .",
    "pseudo - dirac bino may arise in models of d - type susy - breaking .",
    "however , existing models @xcite predict a heavy pseudo - dirac bino with masses at least of the order of 1 tev . in this paper",
    ", we consider pseudo - dirac bino as a candidate of dark matter . without effects of ewsb ,",
    "the bino is a dirac particle whose annihilation cross section is not @xmath0-wave suppressed and can naturally lead to observed relic density .",
    "when ewsb effects are considered , the dirac bino splits into two nearly - degenerate majorana states , and the annihilation of the lightest state is enhanced by co - annihilation between the these two nearly - degenerate bino states . on the other hand ,",
    "the masses of these two states are separated by a few gev s while the scale of momentum transfer in direct detection experiments is of the order of kev s .",
    "therefore , the direct detection experiments is only sensitive to the lightest , majorana , state whose cross section with nuclei is suppressed due to the lack of vector - current interactions .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this mechanism of suppressing the rates of direct detection operates as long as the splitting is larger than 10s of kev s , and is not limited to the splitting of a few gev s ( which happens to be our case here ) . for a similar idea involving the sneutrino as dark matter , see reference @xcite .    in this paper",

    "finally , we summarize our results in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we assume that susy - breaking originates in a hidden sector that contains a gauged @xmath15 group that develops a non - zero @xmath16 , as well as non - zero @xmath17 for some field(s ) @xmath18 that may or may not be charged under the @xmath15 group ( but neutral under sm gauge group ) . in general , both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are communicated to the visible mssm sector . upon integrating out the messengers at the mass scale @xmath19 ,",
    "the majorana gaugino masses are generated through the effective operator @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the chiral superfield containing the mssm gaugino and gauge bosons , while mssm scalar masses are generated through the effective operator @xmath22    in our phenomenological approach , we assume that @xmath18 is charged under @xmath15 , and thus the effective operator of eq .",

    "( [ eq : scalarmass ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by the charge assignments of the messengers and the hidden sector particle content under the @xmath15 gauge group .",
    "although this does not solve the flavor problem of the mssm , we will take this as our starting point for the purpose of discussing pseudo - dirac bino as dark matter . with the above assumptions of susy - breaking , the gauginos of the mssm receive dirac masses rather than majorana masses . as a dirac fermion contains more degrees of freedom than a majorana fermion ,",
    "additional fermionic states ( the gaugino partners , denoted by @xmath23 ) that transform as adjoints of the sm group must be introduced .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) then requires additional bosonic states ( the s - gaugino , denoted by @xmath24 ) that also transform as adjoints of the sm group .",

    "( [ eq : diracgauginomass ] ) is allowed by @xmath28 , while the operator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : majorgauginomass ] ) is forbidden .",
    "we assume that the dirac gaugino masses and the soft scalar masses ( for both the mssm superpartners and the s - gaugino ) are all of the same scale of the order 1 tev .",
    "since the gaugino partners are odd under matter - parity , an immediate interesting consequence of d - type susy - breaking models is that the s - gauginos are even under matter - parity and could be singly produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "dirac gaugino masses are super - soft , and do not enter the renormalization group equations ( rges ) of the scalar soft masses . ignoring all yukawa couplings except for the top yukawa coupling , the rges of all the soft s - fermion masses ( except for the s - top masses ) vanish at one - loop .",
    "the dominant two - loop contributions to the rges involve @xmath30 and are negative .",
    "thus , if the soft masses are unified at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale , we would have a compact ( compared to the typical models of susy - breaking such as gauge- and anomaly - mediated susy breaking ) and inverted spectra with sleptons heavier than the squarks .",
    "in particular , the s - top would be the lightest sfermion and its mass can be approach current experimental bounds ( @xmath31 300 gev ) without s - leptons violating current experimental bounds ( @xmath32 100 gev ) .",
    "such spectra of d - type susy - breaking are very distinct from the typical mssm spectra obtained by gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking and other generic models of susy - breaking .",
    "there are no trilinear soft terms in models of d - type susy - breaking , and the s - top masses can be as light as 400 gev . while this may potentially solve the little hierarchy problem , where large radiative corrections to the soft higgs mass @xmath33 requires a fine - tuning of a few percent to achieve successful ewsb , large @xmath34 and/or @xmath35 are needed for the mass of the lightest cp - even boson to satisfy the cern lep bounds @xcite of @xmath36 gev .",
    "since we do not offer a complete model , we here give only a few remarks about ewsb with d - type susy - breaking .",
    "one possibility of having successful ewsb is to extend the higgs sector with an additional singlet chiral superfield , @xmath37 , with the superpotential @xmath38 that replaces the @xmath39 term in the mssm superpotential . while this superpotential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nmssm - w ] ) is same as that of next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , unlike the typical nmssm scenarios , we do not have trilinear susy - breaking terms in the potential .",
    "instead , we include terms @xmath40 and still achieve successful ewsb with a lightest cp - even boson that satisfies the lep2 bounds .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that , unless the fermionic component of @xmath37 , the singletino ( @xmath41 ) , mixes significantly with the bino , our following analysis does not depend on the existence the chiral superfield @xmath37 .",
    "the mass matrix of the neutral neutralino in a d - type susy - breaking scenario in the basis @xmath42 is @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the dirac bino and wino mass , respectively .",

    "since we are interested in the bino - dominated limit , we will assume that @xmath49 . to simplify our analysis",
    ", we will also make these following three assumptions .",
    "* first , the mass of the lightest bino state is smaller than the mass of the @xmath50-boson , @xmath51 , so the only possible annihilation products are fermion - antifermion pairs . while the annihilation channels into the gauge and the higgs bosons can be important for wino- and higgsino - dominated @xmath1 of the mssm , the fermion - antifermion annihilation channels dominate the total annihilation cross section in the bino - dominated @xmath1 even when the gauge boson annihilation channels are kinematically allowed @xcite . for the d - type susy - breaking scenario , we will simply assume this and postpone the verification of this assumption in a later study .",

    "<S> while the bino - dominated lightest neutralino of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is an interesting and widely - studied candidate of the dark matter , the @xmath0-wave suppression of its annihilation cross section requires fine - tunings of the mssm spectra to be consistent with wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a pseudo - dirac bino that arises in theories with d - type supersymmetry - breaking as an intriguing alternative candidate of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudo - dirac nature of the bino gives a natural mechanism of enhanced co - annihilation because these two states are degenerate in the absence of electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the lightest state can be consistent with limits of direct detection experiments because of the lack of vector interactions , as with the case of the mssm bino . </S>"
