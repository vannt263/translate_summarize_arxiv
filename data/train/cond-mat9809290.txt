    "in a recent article @xcite we have introduced a new approach to the derivation of the bethe ansatz equations of models with bound states . by bound states we mean that the wave functions contain complex momenta @xmath0 which need to be properly handled in the infinite volume limit .",
    "our approach avoids postulating a `` string hypothesis '' for the momenta and allows a systematic and simple procedure to derive all eigenstates .    in our approach",
    "the bethe ansatz is formulated for bound states ( and bound states of bound states ) .",
    "these composites are formed on the infinite line and are incorporated systematically as building blocks of the wave functions defined on a finite ring .",
    "the composites correspond to _ poles _ of the respective s - matrices thus guaranteeing their stability under scattering with other particles .",
    "this necessitates the introduction of appropriate boundary conditions - composite boundary conditions ( cbc ) - which respect the construction and allow the formation of _ exact strings_. we conjecture that the cbc allow a symmetry - presumably yangian - to be manifest already at finite volume , a symmetry that is violated by the conventional periodic boundary conditions , hence appearing in the latter case only in the infinite volume limit",
    ". we shall refer to this approach as the bethe ansatz for composites ( bac ) .",
    "the approach is general and applies to any model where complex momenta appear : the hubbard model , the t - j model , the anderson model and the multichannel kondo model among many others .",
    "we shall discuss here the hubbard model in detail and leave the treatment of the other models for later .",
    "the article is organized as follows :    in section ii we present the model and construct the class of bound state solutions to the schrdinger equation of the model and show how to incorporate them as new ansatz functions besides the usual plane waves into the ba .",
    "we introduce appropriate boundary conditions ( the cbc ) to define the model on a finite configuration space , and deduce the bac equations . a particular class of solutions of the bac equations",
    "is found to underlie the @xmath1-pairing and the charge @xmath2 symmetry group .",
    "next , we clarify the connection with takahashi s string hypothesis @xcite , which , we argue , leads to inconsistencies when finite volume corrections are taken into account .",
    "in section iii we study the bound state excitation spectrum both in the repulsive and attractive models . in the repulsive case ,",
    "holding the number of electrons fixed , we find a three parameter excitation , consisting of two gapless _ holons _",
    "( spinless , carrying charge -@xmath3 ) and a bound state residing in the upper hubbard band ( spinless , carrying charge 2@xmath3 ) .",
    "the latter is in fact an anti - bound state , corresponding to the formation of a bound pair of electrons with positive binding energy dressed by its interaction with the sea electrons . in the attractive case",
    "a dual picture emerges : it corresponds to breaking one of the pairs forming the ground state .",
    "the resulting excitation consists of two gapless ( renormalized ) electrons each carrying charge @xmath3 and spin @xmath4 and a gapped spinless excitation with charge -@xmath5 .",
    "the gapped excitation is an independent mode only away from half - filling and we give numerical results for its dispersion .    in section iv",
    "we summarize our results .",

    "^m = _ j=1^n [ lw2 ] where @xmath11 .",
    "the energy and momentum of the state are then given by @xmath12 the eigenstates of the hamiltonian correspond to the various solutions of eqns ( [ lw1],[lw2 ] ) .",
    "real as well as complex solutions need to be considered to obtain a complete spectrum of states .",
    "we shall argue , however , that complex spin rapidities @xmath13 and complex charge momenta @xmath14 have a different character although both of them were treated in much the same way in the literature .",
    "the former type is associated with the spin degrees of freedom and describes kink / anti - kink bound states . as such they are a many - body phenomenon and make their appearance through complex conjugate solutions of the ba equations for spin rapidities .",
    "the existence of these solutions is postulated in the @xmath15 _ string - hypothesis _ about the form of the ba solutions for large number of particles @xmath6 .",
    "although very plausible , this hypothesis remains unproven up to now @xcite .",
    "the latter type - on which we concentrate in this article - is associated with the charge degrees of freedom . in analogy to the spin sector , they were assumed to correspond to complex conjugate solutions of the lieb - wu equations for charge rapidities .",
    "we will show that they have to be treated differently because they are _ not _ due to a many - body effect but can be identified with the _ elementary _ bound states of the hamiltonian , present already in the few - particle sector .",
    "they have to be incorporated into the bethe ansatz ab initio and lead to a set of ba equations , which we call the bethe ansatz for composites ( bac ) .",
    "the charge complex momenta were also conjectured to form strings , the so called @xmath16 _ strings _ , and bethe - ansatz equations were derived based on this hypothesis @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the bac equations turn out to be equivalent with those derived using the string - hypothesis for the charge rapidities .",
    "this finding does not constitute , however , a proof of the string - hypothesis for a finite system . on the contrary",
    ", we shall argue in section ii d. that the string - hypothesis for charge bound states leads to an _ over - constrained _ set of equations , which has in general no solutions for sufficiently large but finite system size @xmath7 .",
    "we begin by discussing the two string hypotheses separately . to introduce `` @xmath15 - strings '' one assumes complex - conjugate pairs of rapidities @xmath17 , and introducing them into eq ( [ lw2 ] ) one concludes , = + ( e^-n ) with @xmath18 .",
    "more generally , @xmath19 spin rapidities @xmath20 are grouped together to form a @xmath15-string of length @xmath19 : _j = _0 + i ( m+1 - 2j )  j=1  m. [ spinstr ] the solutions with complex @xmath15 to the ba equations are driven to the string position ( [ spinstr ] ) in the limit @xmath21 , corresponding to a many particle effect .",
    "the standard classification emerges in terms of _ spinons _ - chargeless spin-@xmath4 - objects .",
    "the ground state is a singlet , @xmath22 , described by a solution with @xmath23 real @xmath24 rapidities .",
    "the simplest spin excitation corresponds to @xmath25 rapidities , hence @xmath26 .",
    "it is found to be a two parameter state and can be interpreted naturally as a symmetric combination of _ two _ elementary excitations , each carrying spin @xmath4 , the _ spinon _ states . to confirm this picture one needs to show that there is also a state with the spinons combined antisymmetrically to form an excited singlet .",
    "this can be done by introducing a @xmath15-string of length 2 so that again @xmath23 corresponding to a singlet , @xmath22 .",
    "this structure of excitations is universal to @xmath2 invariant models .",
    "it was first observed in the gross - neveu model @xcite , and subsequently rediscovered in several other models : in the kondo model @xcite , the heisenberg model @xcite , the hubbard model @xcite or the t - j model @xcite .",
    "also the spinon - spinon s - matrix , when expressed in terms of rapidities , is identical in these models , and was originally calculated from the bethe ansatz in [ ] .",
    "the fact that quantities such as the quantum numbers of the spinons and their scattering phase shifts are the same in the different models is due to the circumstance that in all of them the interaction has the form of a spin exchange .",
    "thus the spin sector of the various models obeys the same ba equations up to shifts specific to each . as phase shifts and quantum numbers are deduced from simple counting arguments that are independent of those shifts they are identical in spite of a wide variation in dynamics , see [ ] for a detailed discussion .",
    "in addition to these spin strings the standard approach assumes `` @xmath27 strings '' , which should describe the charge bound states @xcite . in the simplest case",
    "one assumes two complex momenta @xmath28 are grouped together with a certain spin rapidity @xmath29 from the set of the @xmath10 : k^=i+ ( ) , [ stri ] which one proceeds to insert into the lieb - wu equations .",
    "this procedure is assumed to hold for @xmath27 strings of any length .",
    "we shall argue in what follows that this approach is flawed ( a brief account was given in [ ] ) and will introduce in its place the bac approach , which does not rely on a string - hypothesis .",
    "we shall argue later that solutions of type ( [ stri ] ) _ do not _ exist for finite @xmath7 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the elementary bound states of ( [ sham ] ) , to be constructed below , can not be defined with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of unbound electrons .",
    "therefore , such states - expected to exist in the infinite volume limit - can not be obtained from finite volume considerations . to obtain a consistent solution at finite volume we need to treat the bound states on an equal footing with the plane wave ( scattering ) states in the bethe ansatz , rather than trying to recover them as special solutions , `` @xmath27 strings '' , of the lieb - wu equations , which were derived from a bethe ansatz based on plane waves .",
    "it is amusing to note that already the expression ( [ stri ] ) hints that it should not be treated , as is conventionally done , on par with the spin strings .",
    "in contrast to the latter the @xmath27 strings are driven to their asymptotic form in the limit @xmath30 , i.e. in the infinite volume limit without the need for @xmath6 to be large as well .",
    "this suggests that they are not due to a many - body correlation effect as the spin strings ( [ spinstr ] ) and should therefore exist already in the two - particle sector of the hilbert space .",
    "we proceed now to explain our approach in detail .",

    "the signs of the energy depends directly on @xmath39 : it is negative in the attractive case ( @xmath40 ) and positive in the repulsive case . in the former case",
    "the real momentum @xmath34 ( which is half the quantum mechanical ( or crystal ) momentum : @xmath41 ) lies near the center of the brillouin zone and in the latter near the edges .",
    "moreover there is a gap in the spectrum @xmath42 : u>0 :  & e(q)|u| + u<0 :  & e(q)-|u| .",
    "[ uu ] the limiting values @xmath43 correspond to @xmath44 from above or below according to the sign of @xmath39 . in both cases @xmath45 tends to infinity at these points .",
    "the state with @xmath46 ( equivalent with @xmath47 ) is strictly local - with a zero width wave function both electrons being one on top of the other .",

    "the bound - state solution ( [ bst ] ) corresponds , as it should , to a pole of the appropriate s - matrix ( or a zero in its inverse ) .",
    "we proceed to make it manifest .",
    "the scattering matrix between two unbound electrons , s_ij(k_i , k_j)= , [ free ] is used to construct the conventional scattering solution ,    f(n_1,n_2)=ae^i(k_1n_1+k_2n_2)(a_a_1a_2(n_2-n_1 ) + [ s_12a]_a_1a_2(n_1-n_2 ) ) [ conven ] where @xmath51 denotes the antisymmetrizer and the momenta are real .    to cast expression ( [ bst ] ) into this form , rewrite it as , a^s_a_1a_2e^i(q - i)n_1e^i(q+i)n_2(n_2-n_1 ) + a^s_a_1a_2e^i(q - i)n_2e^i(q+i)n_1(n_1-n_2 ) , which is of the form ( [ conven ] ) if we identify : @xmath52 and @xmath53 , provided @xmath54_{a_1a_2}=0 $ ] .",

    "now , @xmath292 , the @xmath276 s are distributed symmetrically around zero and @xmath293 .",
    "that means , we can create a hole in the @xmath222- sequence at position @xmath294 , which corresponds to a @xmath295 although the number of allowed slots decreases by one .",
    "this @xmath294 is the third parameter of the spin - triplet excitation and corresponds to the bound state parameter in the repulsive case .",
    "we proceed by introducing the densities , @xmath296 and @xmath297 where @xmath298 , being the ground state distribution with fermi level @xmath204 rather than @xmath299,is determined by the normalization condition @xmath300 .    expressing the smooth density @xmath301 as a sum of three terms , @xmath302 we find , ^b[_c^j ] ( ) = -k_1(-k_j ) [ sigfr ] for @xmath248 and ^b[_h(,_h ) ] ( ) = k_2(-_h ) .",
    "[ sigho ] having solved ( [ sigfr],[sigho ] ) for the densities @xmath303 , we compute the excitation energy .",

    "we have analyzed the simplest gapped excitations . in the repulsive case , when the number of electrons is held fixed , the spectrum consists of two gapless holons , as well as a gapful singlet residing in the upper hubbard band .",

    "the gapped excitations are independent of the concomitant holon excitations away from half - filling .",
    "a dual picture holds for the attractive case .",
    "the upper hubbard excitation we discussed was based on a two - particle bound state ; other excitations emerge when higher composites are studied , and can be identified with elementary @xmath19-complexes , see eq.([mcomp ] ) .",
    "these have higher gaps with respect to the ground state and constitute the upper bands .",
    "we have studied in this article the gapful excitations of the one - dimensional hubbard model , constituting the upper hubbard band .",
    "we have introduced a simple and intuitive construction to incorporate complex momenta solutions that correspond to these states .",
    "our analysis has the following results :    1 )  in infinite volume states with complex momenta are ( elementary ) bound states of the hamiltonian , formed of any ( even ) number of electrons .",
    "these states are spin singlets and live in the upper hubbard band for @xmath317 and the lower band for @xmath40 .",
    "they are renormalized by interacting with other particles , bound or unbound .",
    "2 )  these states exist for finite volume if composite boundary conditions ( cbc ) are introduced .",
    "their existence can be proven exactly without postulating a string - hypothesis , via the bethe ansatz for composites ( bac ) approach .",
    "we have shown that all states can be obtained within this scheme .",
    "3 )  we clarified the physical interpretation of the @xmath50 symmetry in the framework of bac and have shown that it corresponds to the addition of completely local bound states .",
    "a simple proof for the corresponding lowest weight property of the bethe states follows .",
    "4 )  we have argued that the states with complex momenta _ can not _ have the string form for large but finite volume and periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "that means that the @xmath27 string hypothesis may give correct results in the thermodynamic limit but fails for finite volume and pbc .    5 )",
    "the simplest gapped elementary excitations involve a multi - particle bound state . when the number of electrons is held fixed the presence of such a state is accompanied by the appearance of at least two holons in the repulsive case or two dressed electrons in the attractive case .",
    "the gapped excitation is an independent mode only away from half filling , becoming a non - dispersive gap at half filling .",
    "we conclude with two conjectures .",
    "the first is related to the possibility of the bac construction , which follows from the composite boundary conditions : we conjecture that the cbc incorporate a symmetry algebra which should be similar to the yangian symmetry found up to now only in infinite systems .",
    "furthermore , we conjecture that for a finite system with periodic boundary conditions the hubbard model is no longer integrable in the strong sense ; that means the wavefunctions in the @xmath6-particle sector with spin @xmath89 can not be parameterized by the set @xmath318 of @xmath6 momenta and @xmath319 spin rapidities alone , if some of the momenta are complex .",
    "we wish to thank a. ruckenstein , t. kopp , r. fresard , c. bolech , a. jerez and p. zinn - justin for carefully reading the manuscript and for their insightful comments .",
    "this appendix contains the detailed derivation of ( [ sub ] ) , thereby showing the stability of the two - particle bound state if it satisfies the pole condition ( [ xik ] ) .",
    "we define @xmath320 by , a^a_1a_2a_3_[231]=s^ub_1(23)(k , q^-,q^+)a^a_1a_2a_3_[123 ] i.e. it takes particle 1 with the real momentum @xmath78 from the left side of the bound pair to the right side , without changing their momenta . in both the initial and final amplitudes , we have particle 2 on the left of particle 3 , which means @xmath321 and @xmath322 .",
    "therefore , @xmath320 is given as the product , s^ub_1(23)(k , q^-,q^+)=s^uu_13(k , q^+)s^uu_12(k , q^- ) which is equation ( [ frb ] ) . to proceed we write @xmath323 in the form s^uu_ab(k_a , k_b)=(1+s_ab)+(1-s_ab)p_ab where @xmath324 is the spin exchange operator between particles @xmath325 and @xmath326 .",
    "the phase @xmath327 depends on @xmath328 and @xmath329 as , s_ab=. we write s_- =   s_+ = .",
    "then s^ub_1(23)&= & ( ( 1+s_+)+(1-s_+)p_13 ) ( ( 1+s_-)+(1-s_-)p_12 ) + & = & .now we use the fact that the spin space of the three particles is restricted : 2 and 3 are in a mutual singlet in region @xmath330 $ ] .",
    "the spin state space in this region is therefore @xmath331 and a two - dimensional subspace of the eight - dimensional spin space of the three particles . under this condition @xmath332}=-a_{[123]}$ ] .",
    "it follows then @xmath333 if acting on @xmath334 . a further identity valid if the operators act on @xmath334 reads @xmath335 .",
    "note that these operators do not leave @xmath334 invariant .",
    "in general , therefore , the singlet state of particles 2 and 3 will be destroyed upon scattering with particle 1 .",
    "it is due to a non trivial cancelation of terms if momenta @xmath336 , @xmath337 satisfy the pole condition for @xmath338 , that @xmath320 indeed leaves @xmath334 invariant and acts as a pure spin independent phase on the wavefunction .",
    "we use the identities above to simplify expression ( [ equa1 ] ) and find s^ub_1(23)= [ ( 1+s_-)(1+s_+)+2s_+(1-s_- ) ] + p_13[1+s_- -3s_+ + s_+s_- ] .",
    "explicit calculation shows that the term multiplying @xmath339 vanishes for @xmath340 satisfying the pole condition ( [ xik ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath320 is indeed proportional to the identity on @xmath334 , leaving the bound state invariant up to a phase : s^ub_1(23)= ( 1+s_-)= in an analogous manner one writes for the s - matrix of two bound states , consisting of particles 1 and 2 parameterized by @xmath341 and 3 and 4 , parameterized by @xmath342 , s^bb_(12)(34)=s^ub_1(34)s^ub_2(34 ) and one finds immediately s^bb_(12)(34)=.    f. h. l. essler , v. e. korepin and k. schoutens , nucl.phys * b372 * , ( 1992 ) 559 .",
