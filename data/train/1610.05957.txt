    "the coming experiment muse @xcite proposes the measurement of the electromagnetic form factors of proton by the elastic unpolarized @xmath0 scattering at the small momentum transfer and the aim of the precise extraction of the form factors calls for the careful consideration on the tpe effects .    in the literature",
    ", many methods have been applied to estimate the tpe effects in the @xmath11 and @xmath0 scattering , for example , the hadronic model @xcite , gpd method @xcite , phenomenological parametrizations @xcite , dispersion relation approach @xcite , pqcd calculations @xcite and scef method @xcite . among these methods ,",
