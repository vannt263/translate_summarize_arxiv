    "low - dimensional , correlated systems have attracted much attention in recent years due to a large variety of unconventional electronic properties directly connected with electronic correlations . in this context",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems are of special interest , essentially stimulated by theoretical predictions like charge - spin separation for the 1d hubbard model @xcite .",
    "while the 1d hubbard model @xcite is the prototype of an exactly solvable model for correlated electrons , such a charge - spin separation corresponds to the description of the energy eigenstates in terms of occupancy configurations of holons and spinons .",
    "recently the charge - spin separation of that model was shown to occur for all values of excitation energy , the corresponding holon and spinon description being extended to the complete set of energy eigenstates which span the hilbert space @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , quasi-1d materials are ideal model systems which allow the study of basic physical concepts in one dimension . in the last years",
    "there has been a renewed interest on the unconventional spectral properties of these materials @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent angle - resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy revealed very similar spectral fingerprints from both high-@xmath0 superconductors and quasi-1d compounds @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the ultraviolet data for these two different systems could be evidence of the occurrence of the above mentioned charge - spin separation associated with holons and spinons .",
    "the anomalous temperature dependence of the spectral function could also indicate a dimensional crossover @xcite .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite also suggest that the unconventional spectral properties observed in two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials could have a 1d origin .",
    "thus the holons and spinons could play an important role in spectral properties of both 1d and 2d low - dimensional materials .",
    "recently it was found that for the 1d hubbard model there are exact selection rules which limit the number of holons and spinons created by application of rotated electron operators onto any eigenstate of the spin @xmath1 electron number @xcite .",
    "the concept of rotated electron is associated with a unitary transformation introduced in ref .",
    "for such rotated electrons double occupation is a good quantum number for all values of the on - site coulombian repulsion @xmath2 . in order to distinguish the rotated - electron description from the electron representation , the concept of _ effective electronic lattice",
    "_ was introduced @xcite .",
    "it is such that rotated electrons occupy the effective electronic lattice , whereas electrons occupy the _ real - space lattice_. however , these lattices are identical , having the same lattice constant @xmath3 and length @xmath4 , where @xmath5 designates the number of sites .",
    "the occurrence of rotated electrons leads to clear finger prints in the few - electron spectral properties .",
    "indeed , the few - electron spectral functions include several upper hubbard bands corresponding to different and separated energy scales .",
    "the @xmath6 band is spanned by excited states of rotated - electron double occupation @xmath7 . however ,",
    "in general only the first few upper bands have a significant amount of spectral weight .",
    "although the above - mentioned selection rules refer to rotated - electron operators , their existence induces restrictions in the numbers of holons , spinons , and pseudoparticles contained in few - electron excitations .",
    "for instance , according to the results found in ref .",
    "@xcite , about 99% of the upper hubbard band spectral weight of the one - electron addition spectral function corresponds to the first upper hubbard band .",
    "interestingly , rotated electron double occupation @xmath7 equals the number of holons of @xmath8 spin projection @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 denotes the electronic charge and the @xmath8 spin is a @xmath12 algebra associated with the charge degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the charge @xmath10 and @xmath13 holons refer to all values of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath2 and are related to the large @xmath2 dublons and holons respectively , studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the related to the electron - rotated electron unitary transformation is part of the non - perturbative diagonalization of the quantum problem . through out this paper the designation rotated - electron site distribution configuration ( and electron site distribution configuration ) refers to the effective electronic lattice ( and real - space lattice ) .",
    "a property of deep physical meaning is that the energy eigenstates are described by the the same rotated - electron site distribution configurations for all values of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the first - neighbor transfer integral .",
    "this is in contrast to the complex electron site distribution configurations of these states , which change upon variations of the value of the on - site repulsion .",
    "fortunately , the electron - rotated electron unitary transformation becomes the unit transformation as @xmath16 .",
    "thus one can reach the @xmath14 independent rotated - electron site distribution configurations which describe the energy eigenstates by studying the corresponding electron site distribution configurations for the 1d hubbard model in the limit @xmath16 . in the present paper we study",
    "such @xmath14 independent rotated electron configurations . in part , this is achieved by considering the corresponding problem of the electron real - space lattice charge ( and spin ) sequences which describe the energy eigenstates of the 1d hubbard model in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "the problem of the 1d hubbard model in the limit of @xmath16 has been previously studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "in such a limit there is a huge degeneracy of @xmath8-spin and spin occupancy configurations .",
    "thus there are several choices for complete sets of energy eigenstates with the same energy and momentum spectra .",
    "however , only one of these choices is associated with the rotated - electron site distribution configurations reached by the electron - rotated electron canonical unitary transformation .",
    "it refers to the complete set of energy eigenstates generated from the corresponding energy eigenstates of the 1d hubbard model for finite values of @xmath14 by turning off adiabatically the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we call the obtained set of states of the model _ band - momentum energy eigenstates_. the electron occupancy configurations which describe these states have not been studied so far .",
    "in addition to study this problem , in this paper we discuss the relation of the obtained states to an alternative choice of energy eigenstates whose electron site distribution configurations were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    concerning the open questions whose clarification our results are useful for",
    ", one should mention the evaluation of few - electron spectral functions for finite values of excitation energy . except in the limit",
    "@xmath16 @xcite , this is an important open problem of interest for the further understanding of the unconventional spectral properties observed in low - dimensional materials .",
    "the relationship of the pseudoparticles , holons , and spinons to the electrons is a complex problem of crucial importance for the evaluation of these spectral functions .",
    "as discussed in later sections , the concepts of local pseudoparticle and effective pseudoparticle lattices introduced in this paper , as well as the relationship of the energy - eigenstate pseudoparticle occupancy configurations in these effective lattices to the rotated - electron occupancy configurations , provide useful information about such a relationship .",
    "as open questions are concerned , we emphasize that the studies of this paper are a necessary step and a valuable contribution for the evaluation of the overlap between few - electron excitations and energy eigenstates , as further discussed in sec .",
    "elsewhere the tools and concepts introduced in this paper are used in the study of few - electron spectral distributions for finite values of momentum and excitation energy @xcite .",
    "importantly , predictions obtained recently by application of a preliminary version of the theory introduced in this paper and in refs . @xcite",
    "seem to describe both qualitatively and quantitatively the one - electron removal spectral lines observed in real quasi-1d materials by photoemission experiments for finite values of the excitation energy @xcite .",

    "the precise definition of such a concept is a necessary condition for the construction of the energy eigenstates as fourier - transform superpositions of the local states introduced in the previous section .",
    "the concept of effective @xmath18 pseudoparticle lattice is related to the separation of the translational and internal degrees of freedom of these quantum objects , as we explain below .",
    "as mentioned in property 8-iii , in addition to the effective @xmath19 pseudoparticle lattice , there is an effective @xmath18 pseudoparticle lattice for each @xmath111 and @xmath112 pseudoparticle branch .",
    "the spatial coordinate associated with these lattices is the conjugate of the pseudoparticle band - momentum @xmath123 , which is a good quantum number of the many - electron problem .",

    "involve the spatial coordinate of the effective pseudoparticle lattices .    besides the introduction of the effective pseudoparticle lattices , in this section we also provide explicit expressions for the energy eigenstates in terms of slater determinants which involve fourier - transform superpositions of the local states introduced in the previous section .",
    "this clarifies the relation of these energy eigenstates to the rotated - electron site distribution configurations .",
    "indeed , analysis of the new found expressions of the energy eigenstates provides useful information on the processes involved in the diagonalization of the non - perturbative quantum problem after the electron - rotated - electron hilbert - space unitary rotation is performed .",
    "such a non - perturbative diagonalization leads to nothing but the energy eigenstates also reached by the bethe - ansatz solution .",
    "since the present problem is treated in a similar manner for the @xmath104 and @xmath105 pseudoparticles , for simplicity let us again concentrate namely on the case of the @xmath104 pseudoparticles .",
    "the separation of the @xmath18 pseudoparticle translational and internal degrees of freedom can be defined in terms of the following general properties which are obtained from the above properties 1-iii to 8-iii and 1-iv to 3-iv , and other features of the 1d hubbard model :    1-v one can separate the @xmath103-site internal structure of a local @xmath104 pseudoparticle from the problem of the description of the movements of these quantum objects in the effective electronic lattice .",

    "these @xmath103-site domains are point - like sites without internal structure . roughly speaking ,",
    "these point - like pseudoparticle occupied sites correspond to the _ center of mass _ of the @xmath103-site block associated with each local @xmath104 pseudoparticle .",
    "this description corresponds to a separation of the pseudoparticle translational and internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the latter degrees of freedom are described by the @xmath103-site rotated - electron distribution configurations studied in the previous section .",
    "such internal structure plays a key role both in the fulfilment of the @xmath104 pseudoparticle transformations under application of the off - diagonal generators of the @xmath12 @xmath8-spin algebra .",
    "in addition , such an internal structure is a necessary condition for the fulfilment of the periodic boundary conditions of the original electronic problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath104 pseudoparticle translational degrees of freedom are closely related to the spatial coordinates of the effective pseudoparticle lattice .",
    "these spatial coordinates play the role of conjugate variable relative to the band momentum @xmath123 .",
    "such a band momentum obeys eq .",
    "( [ pbcanp ] ) to ensure periodic boundary conditions for the original electronic problem .",
    "an important point is that the pseudoparticle spatial coordinate occupancy configuration of each @xmath104 pseudoparticle branch with finite occupancy in a given energy eigenstate is independently conserved . as the charge ( and spin ) sequence corresponds to the rotated - electron doubly occupied and empty sites ( and rotated - electron singly occupied sites ) only , one can also introduce an independent effective @xmath104 pseudoparticle lattice for each of these occupied pseudoparticle branches , whose coordinates correspond to some of the sites of the local charge sequence only .",

    "thus such a width plays the role of a site domain _",
    "width uncertainty_. as a result , pseudoparticle site domains of width smaller than the @xmath103-site domain are not _ seen _ by the @xmath104 pseudoparticle .",

    "see _ a number @xmath103 of sites out of the @xmath421 sites of such a @xmath422 local @xmath219 pseudoparticle .",
    "3-v let us introduce the concepts of empty sites and lattice constant of the effective @xmath104 pseudoparticle lattice which follow from the above analysis .",

    "<S> moreover , we find that the band - momentum pseudoparticle description associated with the bethe - ansatz takahasi s thermodynamic equations is related by fourier transform to a _ local pseudoparticle _ representation in terms of occupancy configurations of spatial coordinates . </S>",
