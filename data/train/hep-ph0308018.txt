    "in recent years , there have been continuing interests in the electromagnetic @xmath10 transition .",
    "one of the earlier interests was due to the work of becchi and morpurgo @xcite . in that work",
    "they had shown that in the context of the symmetric , non - relativistic , @xmath11 quark model , the transition @xmath12 is a pure magnetic dipole @xmath13 and the contribution from the electric quadrupole @xmath14 is zero .",
    "one crucial assumption in their derivation of this ` selection rule ' is that the quarks in both the nucleon and the delta are in the zero orbital angular momentum states .",
    "these predictions were to be considered as a check to the validity of the quark model , which was still questionable in those days .",
    "later experimental measurements @xcite showed that , indeed , the magnetic dipole @xmath13 contributes predominantly to the @xmath12 transition , while the contribution from @xmath14 is small but non - vanishing .    the non - vanishing value of @xmath14 , and also the coulomb quadrupole @xmath2 in the case of a virtual photon , has generated much theoretical interest .",
    "one way to account for @xmath15 is through the @xmath16-wave mixtures in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 wave functions @xcite .",
    "another way is through the two - body electromagnetic currents from one - gluon and/or one - pion exchange between constituent quarks @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", it is argued that @xmath14 transition is , mainly , due to a two - quark spin - flip operator . on the other hand , in the large @xmath19 limit of quantum chromodynamics",
    "it has been shown @xcite that @xmath20 is of order @xmath21 . to derive this result ,",
    "no assumption about orbital angular momentum of the quarks was necessary .",
    "more recent work in this direction can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another major issue related to the @xmath12 transition , and in general to any hadronic exclusive process , is the applicability of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) at the range of values of momentum transfer @xmath3 accessible in the current generation of experiments . in terms of the ratios",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 ,  pqcd power counting predicts that @xcite , in the limit @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , up to logarithmic corrections to be discussed in this paper . the former prediction has not yet been observed experimentally . in fact , up to @xmath27 gev@xmath9",
    ", @xmath22 stays negative and very close to zero @xcite .",
    "the comparison between data and pqcd prediction for @xmath7 is the main topic of this paper .    to make the pqcd predictions more relevant at finite @xmath3 where",
    "data have been and will be taken , one has to go beyond the asymptotic power counting , make detailed pqcd calculations of hard scattering amplitudes and derive the factorization formula for the experimental observables . in the present case , the relevant quantities are the three independent helicity matrix elements @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass of the nucleon , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . a pqcd calculation of the helicity - conserving matrix element @xmath32 has been known for many years @xcite",
    ". however , a pqcd calculation of the helicity non - conserving amplitudes has not been explored in the literature until recently , because _ it necessarily involves the orbital motion of the quarks _",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a pqcd calculation for the helicity - flip matrix element @xmath1 .",
    "the technical details are basically similar to those in the calculation of the pauli form factor @xmath33 of the proton performed in @xcite . in the calculation , the quarks in the nucleon and the @xmath18 have one unit of relative orbital angular momentum along the direction of motion ( taken as the @xmath34 axis ) _ i.e. _ , @xmath35 . with this",
    "we calculate the `` hard amplitudes '' which , in turn , are to be convoluted with the soft light - cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "the light - cone wave functions of the nucleon and delta have been classified according to their orbital angular momentum dependence in @xcite .",
    "note that we have to add the gluon contribution to maintain color gauge invariance .",
    "we neglect the dynamical gluon effects proportional to the gluon field strength @xmath36 which seems numerically suppressed in general @xcite .",
    "we remark that a detailed calculation of the hard amplitudes for @xmath37 will involve two units of quark relative orbital angular momentum . due to computational complexity",
    "it will not be pursued here .",
    "nevertheless , it can be easily shown that @xmath37 is suppressed , in the high @xmath3 limit by @xmath38 relative to @xmath1 @xcite .    assuming our calculation for @xmath1 is relevant at @xmath3 that is currently explored at jefferson lab , our result and a recent experimentally measured values of @xmath7 enable us to make a phenomenological prediction of this ratio for higher values of @xmath3 .",
    "we mention in this regard that the double logarithmic term , @xmath39 , will play an important role in our analysis . the importance of @xmath39 has also been demonstrated recently in the jefferson lab data on the nucleon elastic form factor @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "our plan of representation is as follows : in section ii we give the notations and definitions needed for the coming sections . in section",
    "iii we present in some detail the calculations performed and comment on the obtained results . in section",
    "iv we perform a phenomenological analysis and make a prediction for @xmath7 .",
    "section v will serve as a summary .",
    "in this paper , we treat the bare delta as if it were a bound state of qcd , although in experiment it appears only as a resonance in certain scattering cross sections .",
    "our analysis is relevant for scattering at the resonance peak where the contribution from the background vanishes by definition .",
    "we will not consider the so - called the dressing of the resonance due to the pion cloud which might be important at small @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "consider the following scattering : @xmath41 which appears as a sub - process of the electro - production of pions .",
    "we are interested in the @xmath1 matrix element , in which case the photon is logitudinally - polarized and with a large virtuality @xmath42 .",
    "our analysis will be carried out in a frame in which the virtual photon @xmath43 , the incoming proton and the outgoing @xmath18 are collinear .",
    "the three momenta of the proton and the @xmath18 are in opposite directions and the @xmath43 is moving in the @xmath44 direction .",
    "the photon polarization vector is given by : @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "we will also need the light - cone wave functions of the proton and the @xmath47 ( with the same charge as the proton ) .",
    "these wave functions are given by @xcite : @xmath48[2][3]\\varepsilon^{ijk}\\left\\{\\psi_p^{(1)}(1,2,3 )   u_{i\\uparrow}^\\dagger(1)\\left [ u_{j\\downarrow}^\\dagger ( 2)d_{k\\uparrow}^\\dagger ( 3)-d_{j\\downarrow}^\\dagger(2 ) u_{k\\uparrow}^\\dagger ( 3)\\right ]",
    "in this section , we derive a leading - order pqcd factorization formula for the helicity - flip @xmath71 matrix element @xmath1 . as shown in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , this is generated by a virtual photon with longitudinal polarization , corresponding to the coulomb quadrupole amplitude .",
    "the first step in calculating @xmath1 is to obtain the hard scattering amplitudes of partons . for this",
    "we follow the guidelines of ref . @xcite . in principle , one has to consider both three - quark scattering with one unit of orbital angular momentum or three - quark - one - gluon scattering without orbital motion .",
    "here we consider explicitly only the former and take into account the latter through the requirement of color gauge invariance , leaving out the contribution with the gluon field strength tensor .",
    "this practice of leaving out dynamical gluon contribution corresponds to the so - called wendzura - wilczek approximation in the literature @xcite .",
    "a key point in the calculation is that since the quark masses are negligible , the quark helicity is conserved .",
    "this is due to the vectorial nature of the electromagnetic coupling between the struck quark and the virtual photon and of qcd quark - gluon coupling @xcite .",
    "when a fock component of the light - cone wave function of the proton contains two quarks of the same flavor and helicity then , clearly , it contributes only when there are two quarks of the same flavor and helicity in the @xmath18 wave function .",

    "<S> we present a leading - order pqcd calculation of the helicity - flip @xmath0 matrix element @xmath1 ( coulomb quadrupole amplitude @xmath2 ) , taking into account the transverse momenta of the quarks and the contribution from the gluons . in the large @xmath3 limit , </S>",
    "<S> its scaling behavior acquires a double - logarithmic correction @xmath4 compared with the standard scaling analysis , due to the contribution from the orbital motion of the small-@xmath5 partons . </S>",
