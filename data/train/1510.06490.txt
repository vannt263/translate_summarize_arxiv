    "ultracold neutrons ( ucns ) are defined operationally to be neutrons of sufficiently low kinetic energies that they can be confined in a material bottle , corresponding to kinetic energies below about 340  nev .",
    "ucns are playing increasingly important roles in the studies of fundamental physical interactions ( for recent reviews , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "experiments using ucns are being performed at ucn facilities around the world , including institut laue - langevin ( ill )  @xcite , los alamos national laboratory ( lanl )  @xcite , research center for nuclear physics ( rcnp ) at osaka university  @xcite , paul scherrer institut ( psi )  @xcite , and university of mainz  @xcite .",
    "one important component for experiments at such facilities is the ucn transport guides .",
    "these guides are used to transport ucns from a source to experiments and from one part of an experiment to another . for applications that require spin polarized ucns ,",
    "it is important that ucns retain their polarization as they are transported ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in other applications in which polarized ucns are stored for extended periods of time , such as neutron electric dipole moment experiments ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the ucna experiment ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is also important that ucns remain highly polarized while they are stored in a material bottle . in some cases ,",
    "the depolarization of ucns due to wall collisions is one of the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties in the final result of the experiment  @xcite .",
    "because of its importance for these applications , the study of spin - flip probabilities and the possible mechanisms for spin flip is an active area of research  @xcite .",
    "the spin - flip probability per bounce has been measured for various materials .",
    "references  @xcite report results on beryllium , quartz , beryllium oxide , glass , graphite , brass , copper , and teflon , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite discusses results on diamond - like carbon ( dlc ) coated on aluminum foil and on polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) foil .",
    "in addition , measurements of the spin - flip probability per bounce have been performed for dlc - coated quartz  @xcite , stainless steel , electropolished copper , and dlc - coated copper  @xcite .",
    "( the results from ref .",
    "@xcite are available in ref .",
    "the reported values for the spin - flip probability per bounce are on the order of @xmath6 for all of these materials with the exception of stainless steel , for which a reported preliminary value for the spin - flip probability per bounce is on the order of @xmath7  @xcite , two to three orders of magnitude larger .",
    "the spin - flipping elastic or quasielastic incoherent scattering from protons in surface hydrogen contamination has been considered to be a possible mechanism for ucn spin flip upon interaction with a surface  @xcite .",
    "so far , however , data and model calculations have not been in agreement .",
    "another possible mechanism is majorana spin flip  @xcite due to magnetic field inhomogeneity near material surfaces , from ferromagnetic impurities or magnetization of the material itself .",
    "in addition , the sudden change in direction that occurs when a ucn reflects from a surface can cause a spin flip in the presence of moderate gradients  @xcite .",
    "gamblin and carver  @xcite discuss such an effect for @xmath8he atoms .",
    "the high spin - flip probability observed for stainless steel in a large holding field  @xcite is likely due to magnetic field inhomogeneity near material surfaces or magnetization of the material itself .",
    "recently , based on the suggestion from ref .",
    "@xcite , we have identified nickel phosphorus ( nip ) coating to be a promising ucn coating material with a small loss per bounce and a high fermi potential  @xcite .",
    "the fermi potentials of nip samples with a phosphorus content of 10.5 wt.% ( 18.2 at.% ) coated on stainless steel and on aluminum were both found to be @xmath9213  nev  @xcite , which is consistent with the calculated value and is to be compared to 188  nev for stainless steel and 168  nev for copper .",
    "nip coating is extremely robust and is widely used in industrial applications .",
    "it is highly attractive from a practical point of view because the coating can be applied commercially in a rather straightforward chemical process , and there are numerous vendors that can provide such a service economically .",
    "it is important that the coating process not use neutron absorbing materials such as cadmium .",
    "furthermore , alloying nickel with phosphorus lowers its curie temperature ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "when made with high enough phosphorus content , nip is known to be non - magnetic at room temperature .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to study its ucn spin depolarization properties and how depolarization depends on the material used for the substrate .    in this paper ,",
    "we report a measurement of the spin - flip probabilities for ucns interacting with nip - coated surfaces .",
    "we investigated aluminum and stainless steel as the substrate .",
    "the results obtained with nip - coated surfaces are compared to those obtained with copper guides .",
    "this measurement was performed as part of development work for a new neutron electric dipole moment experiment at the lanl ucn facility  @xcite and an associated ucn source upgrade  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] , the experimental apparatus and method are described .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis ] describes the analysis of the data . in  sec .",

    "section  [ sec : summary ] provides a short summary of the content of this paper .",
    "the measurement was performed at the lanl ucn facility  @xcite .",
    "spallation neutrons produced by a pulsed 800-mev proton beam striking a tungsten target were moderated by beryllium and graphite moderators at ambient temperature and further cooled by a cold moderator that consisted of cooled polyethylene beads .",
    "the cold neutrons were converted to ucns by a solid deuterium ( sd@xmath10 ) converter .",
    "ucns were directed upward 1  m along a vertical guide coated with @xmath11ni and then 6  m along a horizontal guide made of stainless steel before exiting the biological shield . at the bottom of the vertical ucn guide",
    "was a butterfly valve that remained closed when there was no proton beam pulse striking the spallation target in order to keep the ucns from returning to the sd@xmath10 where they would be absorbed .",
    "a schematic diagram of the experimental setup for the depolarization measurement is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic2 ] .    , width=288 ]    when the ucn gate valve was opened , ucns transported from the source entered the apparatus .",
    "ucns in one spin state , the so - called `` high - field seekers '' for which @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron and @xmath14 is a magnetic field , were able to move past the 6  t magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoidal magnet .",
    "ucns in the other spin state , the so - called `` low - field seekers '' , were reflected back by the potential barrier due to @xmath15 . for @xmath16  t , @xmath17  nev , much larger than the kinetic energy of the neutrons from the lanl ucn source , which has a cutoff at @xmath9190  nev .    on the other side of the high - field region was a ucn guide system ( 76.2  mm in od , 72.9  mm in i d ) that consisted of a set of copper guide sections , a nip - coated guide section , a section of a copper guide with a ucn shutter , and a short section of a copper guide followed by a ucn detector  @xcite .",
    "the guides were placed in a @xmath182  mt magnetic field provided by a set of coils in order to retain the polarization of the ucns .",
    "the ucn shutter , made of copper , had a pinhole 5  mm in diameter .",
    "the gap between the ucn shutter and the end of the guide leading to it was measured to be @xmath180.05  mm .",
    "the high - field seekers were able to move freely through the high magnetic field region , colliding with the inner walls of the guide system .",
    "the number of collisions per second for the high - field seekers in the guide system downstream of the 6  t field region is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total inner surface of the system that the high field seekers interacted with in the guide system downstream of the 6  t field region , @xmath21 is the average velocity of the high - field seekers , and @xmath22 is the density of the high - field seekers . the rate of collisions for the high field seekers was monitored during this time by detecting neutrons that leaked through a pinhole on the shutter in the downstream end of the test guide assembly . if ucns are detected at a rate of @xmath23 and the area of the pinhole is @xmath24 , @xmath25 can be inferred to be @xmath26 assuming that the distribution of ucns inside the system is uniform and isotropic . we discuss the validity of this assumption in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] . for our geometry , @xmath27 .",
    "while the high - field seekers collided with the inner wall of the system at the rate of @xmath25 , spin - flipped neutrons were produced at a rate of @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the probability of spin flip per bounce . while in principle",
    "@xmath29 can depend on the neutron velocity as well as the angle of incidence , and such dependencies can give important information on the possible mechanism of ucn depolarization upon wall collision , we assumed @xmath29 to be independent of the velocity and angle of incidence in our analysis .",
    "reference  @xcite observed no indication of energy dependence within the accuracy of their measurement for the depolarization per bounce on dlc .",
    "the spin - flipped neutrons were not able to pass through the 6  t field region and hence became `` trapped '' in the guide assembly downstream of the 6  t field region .",
    "the number of trapped spin - flipped neutrons in the system at time @xmath30 , @xmath31 , satisfies the following differential equation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the lifetime of the spin - flipped neutrons .",
    "if @xmath25 was constant , then the number of the spin - flipped low - field seekers built up as @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "in general , @xmath33 depends on the ucn velocity @xmath35 . with the velocity dependence taken into account , eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) becomes @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the normalized velocity distribution of ucns at the time of spin flip , and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the cutoff velocity .",
    "the ucn gate valve upstream of the 6  t region was then closed , after which time the high - field seekers were quickly absorbed by a thin sheet of polymethylpentene ( tpx ) attached to the downstream side of the gate valve . on the other hand , the spin - flipped low - field seekers remained trapped in the volume between the 6  t field and the ucn shutter . opening",
    "the shutter allowed the trapped spin - flipped ucns to be rapidly drained from the guide system into the detector .    if the ucn gate valve initially remained open for loading time @xmath40 , followed by cleaning time @xmath41 during which time both the ucn gate valve and the ucn shutter remained closed and at the end of which the ucn shutter was opened , the number of the detected spin - flipped neutrons is given by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff2 ] ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 at @xmath44 .",
    "since both the high - field seekers and the spin - flipped low - field seekers are detected by the same ucn detector , the possible finite detection efficiency cancels in eqs .",

    "measuring @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with sufficient knowledge of @xmath37 and @xmath47 , determines @xmath29 .",
    "the currents for the coils providing the holding field were adjusted so that the field was higher than 2  mt and the gradient was smaller than 10  mt / cm to ensure that the probability of majorana spin flip due to ucn passing an inhomogeneous field region or due to wall collision in an inhomogeneous field was less than @xmath48 per pass or per bounce  @xcite .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic2 ] and table  [ tab : configurations ] , a large portion of the guide system downstream of the 6  t field was made of copper .",
    "copper was chosen because its spin - flip probability was determined to be low by previous measurements  @xcite .",
    "the surface area of the test sample was @xmath1835% of the total surface area of the guide system , diluting the sensitivity to the spin flip due to the test sample .",
    "this was due to geometrical constraints in the experimental area .",
    "two nip - coated samples were prepared , one on a 316l stainless steel tube and the other on an aluminum tube .",
    "both tubes had an i d of 72.9  mm .",
    "the 316l stainless steel tube was cut from welded tubing that had been polished and electropolished to roughness average ( ra ) of 10  microinches ( 0.254  @xmath0 m ) , purchased from valex ( specification 401 )  @xcite .",
    "the aluminum tube was cut from unpolished 6061-t6511 aluminum tubing .",
    "the coating was applied using high - phosphorus content electroless nickel phosphorus plating .",
    "electroless nickel plating is an autocatalytic process in which the deposition of nickel is brought by chemical reduction of a nickel salt with a reducing agent  @xcite .",
    "electroless nip deposits exhibit numerous advantages over those done by other methods  @xcite .",
    "the advantages include hardness , corrosion and wear resistance , plating thickness uniformity , and adjustable magnetic and electrical properties . because of these advantages",
    ", the electroless plating method is widely used in industry .",
    "the coating of our samples was done by chem processing , inc .",
    "the phosphorus content was @xmath49  wt.% ( @xmath50  at.% ) .",
    "the thickness of the coating was 50  @xmath0 m , the largest thickness provided by the vendor , for both samples .",
    "we made this choice as we were interested in seeing if this coating material could keep ucns from seeing the stainless steel s magnetic surface .",
    "( we prepared samples with thinner coating but the limited beam time available to us did not allow us to make measurements with them . ) post - baking at 375@xmath51c for 20  hours was performed for both samples to increase the hardness .",
    "baking also has the effect of removing hydrogen from the nip coating  @xcite .",
    "the coated surface was then cleaned with the following procedure :    1 .",
    "the samples were submerged in alconox solution ( 1 wt.% ) at 60@xmath52c for 10 hours .",
    "the samples were then rinsed with deionized water and then with isopropyl alcohol .",
    "measurements were performed for both nip - coated guide samples .",
    "in addition , to measure the contributions from the rest of the system including the copper guides and the shutter , measurements were made with the nip samples removed .",
    "( the limited beam time did not allow us to perform measurements on uncoated stainless steel samples . ) a description of the three configurations for which measurements were made is listed in table  [ tab : configurations ] .",
    "for all configurations , two series of measurements were performed : one in which @xmath41 was fixed and @xmath53 was varied ( loading time scan ) and another in which @xmath53 was fixed and @xmath41 was varied ( cleaning time scan ) .",
    "table  [ tab : tl_tc ] lists the values of @xmath41 and @xmath53 used in the measurements , and fig .",
    "[ fig : time_spectrum ] shows an example of the measured neutron count rate as a function of time .    [ cols=\"^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the uncertainties of our results were dominated by the uncertainty on the value of the loss per bounce for ucn stored in the system , in particular that for c3 , the contribution of which had to be subtracted from the results obtained for c1 and c2 . for future experiments ,",
    "the uncertainty can be significantly reduced by making the entire guide system out of nip - coated guide sections .",
    "the uncertainty can be further reduced by making an auxiliary measurement to determine the loss per bounce parameter .",
    "this could be achieved by , for example , performing a measurement without opening the shutter and observing the rate at which the depolarized neutrons leak through the pinhole on the shutter , if there is a sufficiently high ucn density stored in the system .",
    "with such an auxiliary measurement , it would be possible to determine the value of @xmath29 on nip - coated surfaces to better than 10% .",
    "in addition , studying the energy dependence of the depolarization probability is of great interest , as it may shed light on the mechanism of ucn depolarization .",
    "such a study can be performed by repeating measurements described in this paper for different field strength settings for the superconducting magnet , thus varying the cutoff energy of the stored neutrons as was done in ref .",
    "such a study of energy dependence would also allow a determination of the energy dependence of the ucn loss parameter .",
    "our results indicate that the depolarization per bounce on the surface of nip - coated 316l ss as well as nip - coated al is as small as that of copper surfaces .",
    "316l stainless steel is austenitic and is considered to be `` non - magnetic . ''",
    "however , stress due to cold working can cause it to develop martensitic microstructure .",
    "such surface magnetism is likely to be the reason for the large depolarization probability observed previously .",
    "the 50  @xmath0 m thick nip coating seems to be sufficiently thick to keep ucns from `` seeing '' the magnetic surface . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "nip coating is extremely robust and is widely used in industrial applications .",
    "the coating can be applied commercially in a rather straightforward chemical process and there are numerous vendors that can provide such a service inexpensively .",
    "the ability of nip coatings to turn ss surfaces non - depolarizing has many practical applications .",
    "ss ucn guides are widely used in ucn facilities because of its mechanical robustness and relatively high ucn potential . however , because of its highly depolarizing nature , other guide materials , such as quartz coated with dlc or nickel molybdenum , have so far been used when non - depolarizing guides were needed .",
    "simple nip coatings can dramatically reduce the depolarization on ss surfaces .",
    "in addition , nip has a higher fermi potential than ss .",
    "we have confirmed that ss flanges retain their sealing properties even after they are coated with nip .",
    "therefore nip - coated ss guides can be used where both mechanical robustness as well as non - depolarizing properties are required .",
    "we measured the spin - flip probabilities for ultracold neutrons interacting with surfaces coated with nickel phosphorus . for 50  @xmath0 m thick nickel phosphorus coated on stainless steel , the spin - flip probability per bounce",
    "was found to be @xmath1 . for 50  @xmath0 m thick nickel phosphorus coated on aluminum , the spin - flip probability per bounce",
    "was found to be @xmath2 .",
    "for the copper guide used as reference , the spin flip probability per bounce was found to be @xmath3 .",
    "the results on the nickel phosphorus - coated surfaces may be interpreted as upper limits , yielding @xmath4 ( 90% c.l . ) and @xmath5 ( 90% c.l . ) for 50  @xmath0 m thick nickel phosphorus coated on stainless steel and 50  @xmath0 m thick nickel phosphorus coated on aluminum , respectively .",
    "our results indicate that nip coatings can make ss surfaces competitive with copper for experiments that require maintaining high ucn polarization .",
    "because nip has a higher fermi potential than copper , can be used with ss guide tubes , has excellent corrosion resistance , and coatings are available commercially , it may become the `` coating of choice '' for a number of applications in experiments conducted with polarized ucns .",
