    "the quest for quantum computer with intrinsic fault tolerance spurs recent interest in searching for exotic fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states that support non - abelian anyons  @xcite . while it is easy to write down a trial wave function with highly nontrivial statistics , the realization of it in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) is not simple .",
    "apart from the technical difficulties of sample preparation and low operating temperature , the lack of effective control on the interaction between particles is a major concern . in a realistic 2deg , electrons interact via long - range coulomb interaction , which may be modified due to the presence of an adjacent gate in the case of graphene or the effect of landau level ( ll ) mixing , which introduces effective three - body interaction ( among others ) . in particular , recent theoretical and experimental studies  @xcite suggest that the perturbative modification of the interparticle interaction can have significant effects on the stability of fqh states .",
    "therefore , the question of how topological order evolves with interparticle interaction remains an interesting question with growing experimental capabilities of controlling microscopic parameters .",

    "@xmath4-wave interactions vanish due to the pauli exclusion principle . unless in the resonance regime , @xmath5-wave interactions in a single - component fermi gas are typical very small .",
    "nevertheless , significant interactions can still be introduced by using atoms or molecules with strong dipole - dipole interactions  @xcite .",
    "the fqh effects in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) dipolar fermi gas with isotropic dipole - dipole interaction have been studied in refs .",
    "the system has been shown to undergo transitions from an integer quantum hall ( iqh ) state to a @xmath6 laughlin state , and to a wigner - crystal state by increasing the rotation frequency . however , we are not aware of any work on the fqh effects in the presence of anisotropic interaction , when the dipoles are not oriented along the rotation axis .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the fqh effects in a fast rotating quasi-2d gas of polarized fermionic dipoles . by tilting the direction of the dipole moments with respect to the rotation axis",
    ", we can tune the dipole - dipole interaction to be anisotropic on the plane of motion .",
    "starting from a laughlin state with isotropic dipolar interaction , we investigate the ground state properties by varying the tilt angle of the dipole moments .",
    "we find that for small tilt angle the ground state can be approximately described by a fqh state .",
    "however , as one further increases the tilt angle , the ground state deviates from the fqh state significantly such that a crystal - like pattern emerges in the density profile of the gas .",
    "the ground state of the system eventually becomes an iqh state when dipole moments are aligned in the 2d plane . for a soft confining potential ,",

    "we studied in details the phase diagram of a finite - size system and concluded that phase transition is expected as the tilt angle @xmath64 varies in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "when the tilt angle is small , the ground state of the system can be described by a fqh state , whose filling fraction depends on the strength of the confinement and hence the average density . at large tilt angle , the system eventually becomes an anisotropic @xmath89 iqh state .",
    "however , for intermediate @xmath64 value , we find that crystal - like order develops in the density profile of the system , suggesting the competition between various parameters and phases . by decomposing the dipolar interaction into isotropic and anisotropic components ,",

    "the various competing orders and ground states are summarized in a complete phase diagram in the parameter space spanned by the tilt angle and the confinement .    in the presence of anisotropy in the interparticle interaction",
    ", we lose the rotational symmetry when treating the system in a disk geometry , hence the total angular momentum is not a good quantum number any more .",
    "nevertheless , we demonstrated that one can still compute the expectation value of the total angular momentum operator for eigenstates and use it to characterize the various ground states emerged as the results of competitions between confinement and anisotropy , as well as between the isotropic and anisotropic components of the interparticle interaction .",
    "particularly interesting is that the resilient features of topological order , such as the presence of hierachical fqh ground states and the low - energy excitations pertaining to the density deformation along the edge of an incompressible quantum hall droplet , remain robust in the presence of anisotropy . while we showed that the calculation of the fidelity of the ground state can be used as a probe to detect phase transitions between states with different topological order",
    ", we believe the mean angular momentum treatment can be readily generalized to the calculation of , e.g. , entanglement spectrum  @xcite , which also facilitates the detection of topological order .    in this paper we demonstrated that an incompressible fqh state with a large excitation gap can survive a fairly large amount of anisotropy .",
    "this implies that the laughlin state , the exact ground state produced by the hard - core potential , is stable against the anisotropic perturbation .",
    "the finding is not unexpected given the remarkable stability of the laughlin states in the presence of long - range interaction , finite thickness of the two - dimensional electron gas , and disorder  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , intriguing to ask the effects of anisotropy on more exotic non - abelian quantum hall states . a more challenging question would be whether it is possible , by tuning the anisotropy , to enhance a certain fqh state , hopefully with exotic statistics .",
