    "the renormalization group ( rg ) transformations is one of the most powerful and frequently used conceptual as well as practical tools in statistical physics and quantum field theory . while conceptually the idea of combining variables on neighbouring sites into complexes is very simple , in practise it almost always turns out to be rather complicated .    historically , the usefulness of rg transformations was realized after the d=2 ising model on triangular lattice was very elegantly solved by niemeijer and van leeuwen @xcite using block spinning .",
    "the nonlinear rg method they used was peculiar to that particular system and did nt allow generalization to more complicated cases . for more general systems wilson @xcite proposed to use the weak coupling ( low temperature ) perturbation theory in momentum space .",
    "this was first applied to scalar @xmath6 models and subsequently to spin systems @xcite and lattice gauge theories for thinning by factor 2 @xcite . for complicated systems like these with local gauge symmetries",
    "some approximate methods were developed like migdal - kadanoff @xcite approximation , variational rg @xcite , mean - field rg @xcite or block spinning using monte carlo numerical methods @xcite .",
    "however , unlike perturbation theory , these approximations are uncontrollable in a sense that it is not clear how to estimate errors .",
    "exact rg transformations are generally not known ( exceptions are decimations in spin chains @xmath0 and mentioned above very special cases in @xmath2 ) . moreover after one rg transformation the resulting action contains generically infinite number of interaction terms , and therefore one is forced to make an additional approximation dropping some of them ( hopefully the less relevant ones ) .",
    "rg transformations are especially useful when applied repeatedly .",
    "this requires self similarity of the approximate effective action and is justified only around fixed points .",
    "note however that accurate thinning of the lattice even just by factor @xmath5 can greatly facilitate the study of a model by means of subsequent mc simulation .",
    "there are several types of the rg transformations .",
    "the conceptually simplest one is the decimation or thinning of degrees of freedom in the configuration space .",
    "some degrees of freedom located , for example , on sites with at least one odd coordinate are simply integrated out .",

    "the main problem is that it is extremely difficult in practise to perform such a transformation even perturbatively .",
    "the relations like eq .",
    "( [ block ] ) are very nonlinear and even singular @xcite .    another type of rg transformations , used especially extensively in field theory , is the momentum space rg @xcite .",
    "one defines the momentum space variables @xmath16 now one performs integration over high frequence modes ( strictly speaking chopping the brillouin zone , but more often the approximate spherically symmetric momentum cutoff @xmath17 is utilized @xcite ) .",
    "this type of rg transformations , while convenient for the @xmath6 model , turns out to be especially inconvenient for constrained systems like the @xmath1 symmetric spin models .",
    "the reason is following . while generally in x - space the constraint are local , for example @xmath18 in p - space it becomes a convolution .",
    "what does it mean now high frequency physical modes ?",
    "the constraint mixes between low and high frequencies .",
    "since most systems of interest belong to this class one has to circumvent the difficulty .",
    "one way is to solve the constraint and make the momentum space rg for physical quantities only .",
    "then the mode integrated effective action contains generally `` non - covariant terms '' .",
    "the original global symmetry is lost since the high frequency modes do not constitute an @xmath1 symmetric set .",
    "problems are more acute with local gauge symmetries . in practice this type of thinning out of degrees of freedom",
    "is often used for the demonstration purposes only and very rarely the actual calculations .",

    "however when trying subsequently to integrate another point , say @xmath25 , all the previous point s neighbours enter the gaussian integral and so on .",
    "the gaussian integration requires inverting increasingly larger matrices .",
    "since we have to integrate out all the points not belonging to the sublattice , some other methods are required .",
    "an exception is the @xmath0 case . here",
    "the size of the matrix does not grow : integration of a point leads just to interactions of the neighbouring remaining points .",
    "this is the reason why it is possible in many cases to explicitly find decimations in @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we perform the decimation for multidimensional free theories . the result does not coincides with the naive continuum limit even in the limit of large @xmath26 .",
    "this is discussed in section 2 . then using this result we develop in section 3 general perturbative formalism for weakly interacting models .",
    "it is applied in section 4 , 5 , 6 to the @xmath1 symmetric nearest neighbours interaction spin model ( the nonlinear @xmath27-model ) . in section 4",
    "we derive the general diagrammatic technique for such a models . in section 5",
    "the solvable @xmath0 model is considered and results compared with the usual perturbative ones , while in 6 the two dimensional asymptotically free model is studied .",
    "the perturbative method generally is better suited for asymptotically free ( = phase transition at @xmath28 ) models like this one .",
    "this is because on fine lattices coupling becomes small .",
    "then the rg transformed model can be investigated , say by the mc method , on coarser lattice . even simplest decimation with @xmath5 reducing the number of points by factor 4 greatly simplifies the numerical work .",
    "a coarse grained effective action is generally obtained as a series in `` closeness '' of the interacting spins : the nearest neighbours , next to nearest etc . in order to make any practical calculations possible",
    ", one has to truncate it at some point .",
    "we restrict our consideration here to the fourth order terms in fields and up to the fourth derivatives .    we conclude in section 7 by discussing complexity of such calculations and some of their uses .",
    "let us start with free boson theory on the lattice .",

    "to summarize we found a systematic way to perform rg of the decimation type in @xmath50 perturbatively .",

    "as we have seen , it operates with original fields only and does not require any ( linear or nonlinear ) transformations of variables . besides , it preserves all the local relations including constraints .",
    "this in turn means that effective ( coarse grained ) theory will obey exactly the same local constraints as did original , and that no non - covariant terms will appear in the effective action . among other applications , this opens a possibility to employ this formalism to study the critical phenomena , when strict control over symmetry properties of model becomes particularly important .",
    "another , compared to others @xcite , useful feature of proposed formalism is its perturbative character",
    ". this can provide us with systematic method of calculations in asymptotically free models and , what is even more essential , with a way to do _",
    "controllable _ approximations .",
    "hopefully , this side of proposed formalism will make it applicable in situations when such a control is essential , as in above mentioned critical phenomena or in the recently proposed double strong - weak expansion approach @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in asymptotically free theories there exist region in parameter space where both strong and weak coupling expansions are valid at the same time . namely both the practical weak coupling @xmath344 and strong coupling @xmath345 expansion parameters are reasonably small .",
    "the `` loop factors '' @xmath346 in the practical weak coupling expansion parameter @xmath347 are partly responsible for this . in this",
    "scheme high frequency modes are integrated out perturbatively and the resulting effective action treated using strong coupling expansion.the symmetry preserving and controllable perturbative decimation technique is the most suitable tool for the first part of such calculations . of course , to apply the method described here to the one dimensional models one should take into account correctly the nonperturbative instanton - like configurations , because in @xmath0 the perturbation theory can be ill defined ( one such example we considered in section 5 ) . in higher dimensions , however , the relative contribution of the nonperturbative configurations becomes less significant .",
    "we would like to stress also that the method described here unlike most of the other decimation ( and exact rg in general ) techniques , enables us to perform decimations not restricted to the simplest case @xmath5 only .",
    "the @xmath348 calculation just takes a bit more computer time .",
    "in this appendix free wilson fermions will be considered and decimated fermionic action in one dimension with @xmath297 will be derived via matching .",

    "the reason of such a strange behaviour is that actually in massless fermion theory without the wilson term there is no way to build an exponential generating functional for decimated theory and therefore there is no way to define an effective action .",
    "moreover , one can check that in such a theory correlators between the even ( or odd ) cites vanish , so that @xmath5 decimation in this case leads to the complete loss of information .    in general case",
    ", the propagator takes the form : @xmath356 that is the kernel of an effective action is @xmath357    notice that for massless theory effective action after field rescaling has the same form with the new wilson parameter @xmath358 this means that the massless wilson action in @xmath0 is a perfect action and has a fixed point @xmath359 .",
