    "however , the problem of finding a lower bound on the speed in the case of the complete graph is still open , and we believe that the true rate of convergence is closer to the one in ( [ eth2uppera ] ) and ( [ eth2upperb ] ) .",

    "the special case @xmath60 will be discussed in section [ s : casetwo ] .",
    "there exist a few mathematical results on the asymptotic behavior of vrrw preceding this work .",

    "recent results of benam and tarrs @xcite show similar localization phenomenon for certain natural generalizations of vrrw .",
    "the asymptotic results in both @xcite and @xcite are shown to hold only on an event of _ positive _ probability .",

    "many interesting open questions remain .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections  [ s : polyaexample][securn ] recall a few techniques used in related settings , and establish some preliminary results . in section  [ sec_mt ]",
    "we introduce a modified vrrw on a triangle with one special ( more reinforced ) vertex and study the asymptotics of weights on the nonspecial vertices .",
    "section  [ s : anaclike ] contains the proof of theorem [ th1 ] in the general ( and novel ) case of complete - like graphs @xmath0 , and section  [ sec : generalize ] discusses some generalizations for @xmath19-partite graphs with leaves .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : speed ] we show theorem [ th2 ] .",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath64 ( resp .",

    "the above notations extend in a straightforward way to the stochastic setting .",
    "we devote this short subsection to a calculation that will hopefully both stimulate the reader s interest in the problem , and point out some of the difficulties awaiting .",
    "in addition , we will use a modification of the supermartingale below in arguments of section  [ s : anaclike ] .",
    "fix @xmath1 , and let @xmath75 be the @xmath19-color plya urn started with one ball of each color .",
    "in particular , at each step , one ball is drawn from the urn at random , and it is placed back immediately together with another ball of the same color . as usual , let the initial time be @xmath19 , and for each time @xmath76 denote by @xmath77 the number of balls of color @xmath3 , @xmath18 in the urn at time @xmath20 . in this way @xmath78 always . a slick way ( see @xcite , section 2.1 ) to prove convergence of the frequencies @xmath79 , @xmath18 , to nontrivial ( nonzero , a.s . )",
    "random variables is via the following martingale method .",
    "using classical martingales @xmath79 for showing this convergence is not optimal for showing that the limit is nonzero , almost surely .",
    "define @xmath80 and then check that the drift of this process equals @xmath81 and is therefore almost surely negative .",
    "thus @xmath82 is a nonnegative supermartingale and it converges almost surely to a finite quantity , hence @xmath79 converges almost surely to a positive quantity .",
    "next consider the vrrw on complete graph with @xmath19 vertices .",
    "the only difference of transitions of @xmath83 from those of @xmath84 is that @xmath85 becomes @xmath86 with probability proportional to @xmath77 no matter which ball was drawn at time @xmath87 , while @xmath88 becomes @xmath89 with probability proportional to @xmath90 only if the current position of the vrrw is not @xmath3 ; in turn this proportion is taken with respect to the values at all but the currently visited site . if one tries simply to recycle the above supermartingale by subtracting a drift increment of order @xmath91 at each time @xmath20 when @xmath92 , then on the event that @xmath90 is asymptotically of order larger than @xmath93 [ this happens , since @xmath94 , a.s . ]",

    "\\(2 ) the result in theorem  [ thurn2 ] may be more surprising , in that it shows @xmath134 to be of the order @xmath138 multiplied by a specific constant , with a random lower order correction .",

    "\\(3 ) both of the above theorems can be derived using an elegant method of athreya and ney @xcite , by embedding the urn into a continuous time multi - type branching process . however , the proof by embedding ( see also @xcite for recent progress ) is much less robust to `` variations '' in dynamics than the martingale proofs of @xcite .",
    "one such variation is the setting where some ( or all ) of the parameters @xmath145 are perturbed about fixed values ( their means ) , and where the distribution of these random perturbations varies over time .",

    "it remains to prove the claim on the event @xmath197 where @xmath154 switches sign infinitely often .",
