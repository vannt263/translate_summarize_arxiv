    "it corresponds to the gfc in the sense that changing the parameters as @xmath238 with @xmath94 satisfying the gfc does not alter @xmath239 or @xmath240 , which are constants in the above canonical form , to first order in @xmath241 . in practice , this means that the canonical form is approximately maintained when making finite steps in the tdvp algorithm .",
    "the above canonical form can be reached via a gauge - transformation @xmath242 where @xmath243 and @xmath244 are non - trivial ( see ) , such that the uniform bulk parameters @xmath30 are also transformed . since the overall state and also the left and right uniform bulk states are unaffected by these transformations , performing them does not affect evolution under the tdvp equations .",
    "for real - time evolution , numerical integration using the euler method is inefficient since small step sizes @xmath245 are required to keep the @xmath246 integration errors made with each finite step small .",
    "a well known integration method with more favorable error scaling is the 4th order runge - kutta method ( rk4 ) @xcite , which makes per - step errors @xmath247 at the cost of three extra evaluations of the derivative .",
    "it builds a final step by making three smaller steps and weighting the derivatives obtained at the visited points .",
    "given a differential equation @xmath248 , the rk4 method estimates @xmath249 with @xmath250 and @xmath251 the smps tdvp flow equations derived in the main part of this work provide the derivative function for the @xmath168th site @xmath252)$ ] , allowing us to implement the rk4 integrator without any additional tools .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath253 , obtained by adding the tangent vector parameters from the various sub - steps , is not gauge - fixing .",
    "this is because each individual @xmath254 , although it is gauge - fixing for the sub - step point @xmath255 at which it was obtained , is not generally gauge - fixing when applied at the original point @xmath35 .",
    "additionally , each sub - step changes the gauge - choice slightly , since gauge - fixing only holds to first order in the step size . on the other hand , since the gauge - fixing flow equations do preserve the gauge choice when integrated exactly , gauge - fixing should improve with the accuracy of the numerical integration .",
    "we should thus expect the rk4 method to maintain the gauge choice up to errors of @xmath247 with each step .",
    "this is far better than the euler method , which incurs @xmath246 errors .",
    "the error can be quantified by the change in the energy expectation value , which is conserved under exact time evolution .",
    "we confirm the benefits of our rk4 implementation by comparing it to the euler method for the heisenberg model example described in the main text , which we simulate on a finite chain with open boundary conditions in order to avoid errors due to the interface with the bulk . to compare the efficiency of the two methods",
    ", we set the step sizes such that the computation time per unit simulated time is roughly the same and examine the overall change in the energy expectation value after a period of simulated time @xmath256 .",
    "since a single rk4 step requires roughly four times as much computation as an euler step , we choose @xmath257 . for @xmath258 , the energy errors after a time @xmath259 are @xmath260 and @xmath261 , showing a significant advantage for the rk4 method for the same computation time .",
    "the vast majority of the rk4 error comes from the first four steps , whereas the euler errors are uniformly distributed in time . excluding these steps from the rk4 error estimate results in @xmath262 .",
    "both @xmath263 and @xmath264 are in line with the theoretical global error estimates of @xmath265 and @xmath266 respectively .",
    "the comparatively large errors made by the rk4 method during the first few steps are caused by the presence of particularly small schmidt coefficients , indicating that the bond - dimension is higher than necessary .",
    "small schmidt coefficients lead to instability because the squares of the schmidt coefficients appear in the @xmath267 and @xmath268 matrices , which are inverted in the tdvp algorithm , amplifying errors on small values greatly . to mitigate this",
    ", the bond - dimension can be reduced dynamically ( and increased later if necessary ) , cutting off schmidt coefficients that are close to zero .",
    "alternatively , an integrator that is robust under low - rank conditions could be used @xcite .",

    "<S> [ tdvpbox ]    the simulation of infinite quantum spin systems has mostly been confined to the translation invariant setting ( usually by restricting states to subsets of mps that are either fully translation invariant or invariant under translations by @xmath1 sites @xcite ) . however , the ability to explore locally nonuniform states on an infinite lattice is particularly attractive for studying the dynamics , e.g.  scattering , of localized excitations in large systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , this would provide a realistic setting in which to study quantum field excitations . </S>",
    "<S> there has been some prior work in this direction , building on previous light - cone results @xcite , where the dynamics of a local disturbance is ( partially ) studied in the heisenberg picture . </S>",
    "<S> these approaches can become expensive for systems with large local spin dimensions ( such as those appearing in lattice field theory ) . </S>",
    "<S> another direction that has been suggested @xcite , is to work completely in the schrdinger picture with infinite uniform mps and to add a finite nonuniform region .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we explore the locally optimal implementation of the tdvp for uniform mps with a dynamically expandable nonuniform segment . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the equations of motion for the variational parameters using a particular choice of gauge - fixing which allows us to integrate the variational dynamics with a complexity that scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the length of the nonuniform piece ( the number of sites ) , @xmath4 is the desired integration time , @xmath5 is the local spin dimension , and @xmath6 is the bond dimension . even though the ends of the nonuniform region can move , there may be some backscattering due to boundary effects ; we describe how to compensate for these with the addition of an _ optical potential _ term . </S>",

    "<S> secondly , given a purely uniform hamiltonian ( @xmath18 ) and an initial state that differs only locally ( in a region @xmath13 $ ] ) from an eigenstate of @xmath19 , our algorithm can be used to simulate the resulting locally non - trivial dynamics .    to capture a locally nonuniform state using mps </S>",
