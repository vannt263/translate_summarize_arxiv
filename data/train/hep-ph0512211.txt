    "the charged fermion flavor parameters  quark masses and mixing angles and charged lepton masses  exhibit a structure that is not explained within the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the two puzzling features  smallness and hierarchy  are very suggestive that an approximate horizontal symmetry is at work .",
    "the simplest framework that employs such a mechanism to explain the flavor puzzle is that of the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "the various generations carry different charges under an abelian symmetry .",
    "the symmetry is spontaneously broken , and the breaking is communicated to the sm fermions via heavy fermions in vector - like representations .",
    "the ratio between the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the mass scale of the vector - like fermions provides a small symmetry - breaking parameter .",
    "yukawa couplings that break the fn symmetry are suppressed by powers of the breaking parameter , depending on their fn charge .",
    "model building within the fn framework usually proceeds as follows .",
    "one chooses a value for the small symmetry - breaking parameter(s ) , and a set of fn charges for the fermion and higgs fields .",
    "these choices determine the parametric suppression of masses and mixing angles .",
    "one then checks that the experimental data can be fitted with a reasonable choice of order - one coefficients for the various yukawa couplings .",
    "thus all fn predictions are subject to inherent limitations :    * the fn charges are not dictated by the theory .",
    "* the value of the small parameter is not predicted .",
    "* there is no information on the @xmath2 coefficients .",
    "the predictive power of the fn framework is thus limited .",
    "there is one relation among the quark flavor parameters that is independent of the choice of horizontal charges @xcite , and there are three in the lepton sector @xcite .",
    "the resulting predictions , that suffer from order one uncertainties , are consistent with the data .",
    "additional relations apply in the supersymmetric extension of the sm , but to provide new tests of the fn mechasnim , supersymmetric contributions to flavor changing processes must be explored , and the universal effects of rge running should be small @xcite .",
    "the predictive power is sharply enhanced in the framework of gut . with an @xmath0 gauge symmetry ,",
    "the number of independent fermion charges is reduced from fifteen to six .    to make further progress",
    ", one would like to embed the fn mechanism in a framework where some or all of the inherent limitations described above are lifted .",
    "this may happen in string theory . while realistic constructions of the supersymmetric sm in string theory are still under study @xcite , much progress has been made in the search for string - inspired phenomenologically viable extensions of the sm such as the fn framework .",
    "the basic idea is that the fn symmetry is a pseudo - anomalous @xmath3 symmetry @xcite .",
    "then the small parameter depends on the fn charges and , furthermore , if one assumes gauge coupling unification , there is a single constraint on the fn charges that can be translated into a relation between the fermion masses and the @xmath4-term .",
    "this idea is based on ingredients of the heterotic string and has led to a detailed investigation of the resulting phenomenology ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite . )    on the other hand , we are not aware of any attempt to - date to construct fn models which arise from d - brane configurations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we take a step in this direction and consider fn models from quiver gauge theories .",
    "these theories arise at low energy as the effective theories on d - branes placed at singular geometries ( see @xcite and references therein ) . as opposed to the heterotic case ,",
    "these theories typically have numerous anomalous @xmath3 s .",
    "the anomalies are cancelled through the generalized green - schwartz ( gs ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "we employ these anomalous @xmath3 s as flavor symmetries and construct fn models .",
    "as we show below , the structure of these theories tightly constrains model building and hence the realization of the fn mechanism . as a consequence",
    ", we will see that much can be said about the lepton sector .",
    "in particular , within the framework of @xmath0 gut model with a single fn - symmetry breaking field , there is essentialy a single viable model which predicts mass anarchy in the neutrino sector .",
    "it is worth noting that within the @xmath0 gut model , it is a priori difficult to get the correct flavor hierarchy altogether .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath5 fields arise from open strings with both ends residing on the same set of @xmath6 stack of branes , while @xmath7 fields come from strings with one end on the @xmath6 stack and the other on a different brane which may provide the necessary @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : branes ] .",
    "in particular this means that the @xmath5 fields are not charged under the fn symmetry and there is no hierarchy in the up sector . as we show below , one can overcome this problem by extending the gauge symmetry , and the obtained structure is sufficiently restrictive to provide prediction regarding the neutrino sector .",
    "gauge group and a distinct @xmath9 .",
    "the fundamental fields are strings stretching between the two stacks and are thus charged under the fn group , while the antisymmetric fields connect only to the @xmath6 stack and have no @xmath9 charge . ]",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : quiv - gauge - theor ] we discuss quiver gauge theories and their orientifold generalizations .",
    "we further discuss higgsing and the role of anomalous @xmath3 s ( and the problems that accompany them ) in such theories . in section",
    "[ sec : frogg - niels - models ] we investigate the embedding of the fn mechanism within quiver gauge theories .",
    "we argue that it is difficult to construct models with non - renormalizable superpotential terms .",
    "we focus on the case of a single @xmath8 symmetry that arises from anomalous @xmath3 s .",
    "we show that there are severe restrictions on the possible fn charges , which lead to a generic constraint on the maximal hierarchy in this framework . in section [ sec : su5-gut - models ]",
    "we construct fn models in @xmath0-gut theories with a single fn field .",
    "we show that there are only three possible fn charges for the @xmath5-plets , and two for the @xmath7-plets .",
    "this situation makes the theory highly predictive .",
    "in particular , requiring that quark masses are hierarchical , a single set of charges is singled out , leading to a unique flavor structure .",
    "the flavor structure of the lepton sector is fixed , and neutrino mass anarchy is predicted .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : summary ] . a full , consistent , quiver realization for the su(5 ) gut theory , with emphasis on anomaly cancellation , is presented in appendix [ sec : an - su5-gut ] .",
    "we collect the six tables of our paper at the very end .",
    "tables i - iii show possible fn charges and suppression factors in generic quiver theories , while tables iv - vi give all possible models within our @xmath10 framework .",
    "a wide class of @xmath11 supersymmetric vacua is obtained by placing d - branes on singular manifolds of type ii strings such as orbifolds and orientifolds @xcite .",
    "placing d - branes at such singularities produces at low energy conformal gauge theories @xcite , while adding fractional d - branes breaks the conformal symmetry , rendering a four dimensional chiral gauge theory .",
    "a quiver diagram is an efficient way for describing the gauge theory obtained from the open string sector ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the degrees of freedom of oriented strings can be described as strings starting and ending on d - branes .",
    "consequently , the fields in the theory transform in the fundamental of a @xmath12 factor of the gauge group and in the antifundamental of another @xmath13 factor .",
    "it is therefore possible to describe the field theory by a quiver diagram , where we denote each @xmath12 factor by a node in the graph and the fields are represented by directed lines connecting two such nodes . the orientation of the line represents the orientation of the string : a line coming out of a node corresponding to a @xmath12 gauge group factor stands for a field in the fundamental @xmath14 , while a line going into a node corresponding to @xmath13 represents a field transforming in the antifundamental @xmath15 .",
    "a line originating and ending on the same node , describes a field in the adjoint representation of the corresponding @xmath16 factor .",
    "gauge invariant field combinations , which may be present in the superpotential , can also be seen using the diagrammatic description .",
    "a field transforming in the fundamental of a given @xmath16 , must interact with a field in the antifundamental of the same @xmath16 in order to get an invariant interaction .",
    "in other words , if there is a field coming into a given vertex , we must also have a field going out of that same vertex .",
    "this has to be the case for all the vertices , so an invariant interaction is described by a closed loop in the quiver diagram .",
    "in particular , a renormalizable cubic term in the superpotential is represented in the quiver by a closed triangle . in general , however , not every closed loop in the quiver which originates from a certain geometry appears in the superpotential .",
    "the general problem of extracting the spectrum and superpotential from a given geometry is still not solved , and only specific examples are known .      strictly speaking ,",
    "gauge theories arising from unoriented string theory are not quivers since the low energy field theory can not be described by a directed graph .",
    "nevertheless , these theories may also be described diagrammatically by ` extended ' quivers , where the lines representing the strings are no longer directed . instead",
    ", the two ends of each string can independently be in either the fundamental or the antifundamental .",
    "thus each line must be drawn with an arrow at each of the two ends , indicating what is the representation of the corresponding string under each of the two gauge group factors .",
    "unoriented strings with both ends coming out of the same set of branes may reside in either the symmetric or the antisymmetric combination of @xmath17 .",
    "which of these two options is realized is directly related to the orientifold projection in the original theory : it is the antisymmetric ( symmetric ) part for the @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) orientifold projection .",
    "having said that , we stress that the effective field theories of unoriented strings on singular manifolds are only known for @xmath20 orbifolds .",
    "nevertheless , it is expected that the unoriented nature of the string should lead to the same ` extended ' quiver type diagrams in more general singularities .",
    "again , invariant interactions follow from the ( extended ) quiver .",
    "it corresponds to a set of lines for which each node has the number of ingoing fields equal to the number of outgoing fields .",
    "higgsing , that is the spontaneous breaking of the gauge group via vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of scalar fields , changes in general the low energy description of a given theory .",
    "in particular , by higgsing a quiver gauge theory , one obtains a ( not necessarily supersymmetric ) new quiver gauge theory where the low energy degrees of freedom are bi - fundamentals of the conserved gauge groups .",
    "we can thus write an effective quiver by identifying or splitting the vertices and lines so that each new node represents an unbroken @xmath16 gauge group .    as an example , consider string theory on a @xmath21 orbifold of the conifold ( also known as @xmath22 ) , with @xmath23 branes at each representation of @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting @xmath24 ^ 6 $ ] gauge theory is described by the quiver of fig .",
    "[ fig : y30]a .",
    "if we higgs the theory by giving @xmath25 a vev proportional to the unit matrix , @xmath26 the corresponding @xmath27 group is broken to the diagonal @xmath16 , and the @xmath24 ^ 5 $ ] gauge theory of fig .",
    "[ fig : y30]b is obtained .",
    "the @xmath25 field itself is eaten up by the longitudinal modes of the broken gauge fields .",
    "higgsing @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the same way , one finds the @xmath24 ^ 3 $ ] theory described by fig .",
    "[ fig : y30]c , which is exactly the quiver of the orbifold @xmath30 @xcite .     quiver diagram to a @xmath31 quiver : a ) the @xmath22 quiver diagram ; b ) the effective quiver diagram induced by higgsing @xmath32 ; c ) the @xmath30 quiver induced by higgsing also @xmath33 . ]",
    "if , instead , we break the @xmath22 quiver by choosing a different form of the vev for @xmath25 , @xmath34 the symmetry breaking is @xmath35 .",
    "this breaking is no longer supersymmetric and @xmath25 in not eaten up completely .",
    "the lines and the nodes split and the quiver takes a very different form , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : y30other ] . other breaking patterns of @xmath36 symmetries with bi - fundamentals can be obtained .",
    "the most general breaking is @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "it leads to more complicated quiver diagrams which , in general , will not be supersymmetric due to a non - vanishing d - term .",
    "however , by giving vevs to a pair of fields in a vector representation , supersymmetry may easily be preserved .",
    "quiver by a diagonal vev with two different eigenvalues with multiplicities @xmath39 and @xmath40 . ]",
    "different patterns of breaking are generated when the higgsed field is in the adjoint representation or , for ` extended ' quiver , in the fundamentals of both gauge groups or in the symmetric ( or anti - symmetric ) representation . in all cases ,",
    "the resulting theories can be described by a new quiver diagram .",
    "typically , many of the @xmath3 factors associated with the @xmath16 gauge groups are anomalous , with anomalies cancelled by the generalized green - schwartz ( gs ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of the heterotic string , in type ii string theory there can be several such anomalous @xmath3 factors .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding gauge fields are massive independent of whether the symmetry is spontaneously broken ( the spontaneous breaking is induced by non - vanishing fayet - illiopolous ( fi ) terms ) @xcite . in the case that the symmetry is not broken by scalar vevs , these @xmath3 factors remain as global symmetries @xcite and the corresponding @xmath41 factors remain good gauge symmetries .",
    "thus each node in the quiver has a corresponding ( local ) global ( non-)anomalous @xmath3 .",
    "phenomenologically , these @xmath3 factors pose considerable problems to model building , essentially since the global @xmath3 symmetries of the sm or its supersymmetric extensions ( ssm ) are not directly related to the local gauge groups .",
    "consider , as an example , a supersymmetric quiver theory which contains the @xmath42 gauge group @xcite . under the corresponding @xmath3 ,",
    "all the doublets ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) are charged @xmath47 .",
    "the superpotential of the ssm has the following form : @xmath48 it is clear that , to allow for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the @xmath3 charges of @xmath45 and @xmath46 must be the same .",
    "but then the @xmath4 term is forbidden . a similar problem exists in the @xmath0 gut models @xcite and their extensions , as we discuss in section [ sec : su5-gut - models ] .",
    "there are three possible solutions to the above problem :    1 .",
    "the particle content of the low energy theory is extended in such a way that the symmetry is realized .",
    "for example , an extended higgs sector @xcite enlarges the global symmetry .",
    "the @xmath3 is broken spontaneously .",
    "the only way to do this without breaking the associated @xmath41 gauge group is by letting a singlet composed of @xmath23 fundamentals to obtain a vev .",
    "this breaks the @xmath3 down to a @xmath51 .",
    "such composite singlets may exist if they are charged under a different , confining gauge group .",
    "the anomalous @xmath3 is broken by non perturbative effects .",
    "depending on the matter content , such effects break the symmetry down to @xmath52 for some integer @xmath53 .    while difficult to analyze , these solutions allow realistic extensions of the ssm through quivers .",
    "we discuss these possibilities further in section [ sec : su5-gut - models ] .",
    "the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism @xcite provides an explanation to the flavor puzzle using a horizontal symmetry .",
    "quarks and leptons of various generations are charged differently under a symmetry @xmath54 which is spontaneously broken .",
    "the simplest realization is through the use of a single abelian @xmath3 which is broken by the vev of a scalar field @xmath55 . to allow for @xmath56-invariant interaction terms involving the sm higgs and fermion fields , powers of @xmath55 must of be involved , depending on the @xmath56-charge of the yukawa interaction",
    "thus , non - renormalizable interaction terms arise , suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath57 , the scale at which the breaking of @xmath58 is communicated to the sm .",
    "the effective yukawa interactions are then suppressed by powers of @xmath59 , and are characterized by smallness and hierarchy , as required phenomenologically .    one way of embedding the fn mechanism in string theory would be by identifying the scale @xmath57 with the string scale , and obtaining a superpotential that has most of its terms non - renormalizable ( the top , and perhaps other third generation yukawa couplings , being the exception ) .",
    "this goal is difficult to achieve .",
    "quiver gauge theories which arise from d - branes at singularities have a superpotential determined fully by the geometry . geometrically engineering",
    "the required superpotential is hard .",
    "most of the geometries which are under control arise from orbifold singularities @xcite or toric geometries @xcite .",
    "( these two classes are , of course , not separate : abelian orbifolds are toric . ) in the first type of geometry , the superpotential is obtained by truncating @xmath60 superconformal yang - mills which has cubic interactions . for the second type , in the case of @xmath61 geometries , one obtains also quartic interactions . in any case , it is difficult to construct a quiver theory with a superpotential that has most of its terms non - renormalizable .",
    "a second approach is to construct a renormalizable model above the scale @xmath57 which , at low energy , produces the required interactions .",
    "further motivation for such a construction comes from the possible identification of the fn symmetry with an anomalous @xmath3 , as discussed below .",
    "a renormalizable model is easy to construct with the introduction of additional vector - like massive fields . as an example , consider a non - renormalizable superpotential term of the form @xmath62 to generate such interaction , we introduce additional vector - like massive fields @xmath63 @xmath64 , with masses at the scale @xmath57 and the following charges under the horizontal symmetry : @xmath65 taking the renormalizable superpotential to be @xmath66 and integrating out @xmath67 and @xmath68 , one finds the required interaction , eq . .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the relevant diagrams which generate this low energy interaction for @xmath69 and for general @xmath39 .     using only cubic interactions . ]",
    "to relate the fn mechanism to a quiver field theory , one needs to identify a global symmetry that can play the role of a viable horizontal symmetry .",
    "we limit our search of viable models to theories with the following features :    * the fn symmetry arises from anomalous gauged @xmath3 s in the quiver .",
    "( in particular , we do not consider global symmetries of the open string sector that are related to isometries in the dual gravitational theory . ) * the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry comes from a vev of a single field , @xmath55 . *",
    "the ratio of the two relevant energy scales is small , @xmath70 allowing for smallness and hierarchy in the effective yukawa couplings .",
    "we note several points that hold generically in a fn mechanism that arises from a quiver theory using an anomalous @xmath3 :    1 .   for @xmath55 to be charged under an anomalous @xmath3",
    ", it must either be stretched between two distinct vertices , or have its two ends on the same vertex but with both ends sitting in the same representation ( either fundamental or antifundamental ) .",
    "the second situation is possible only in the orientifold case .",
    "since @xmath55 is generically charged under the full @xmath71 $ ] , and not just under the anomalous @xmath3 factors , it necessarily breaks some of the gauge groups .",
    "this means that _ the fn mechanism requires an extended group_. 2 .",
    "the charge of a given field under the fn symmetry is fixed by its representation under the corresponding non - abelian gauge groups .",
    "for example , assume @xmath55 resides in the @xmath72 representation of a @xmath73 gauge group .",
    "it is neutral under the sum of the two @xmath3 factors , @xmath74 , but has a charge @xmath75 ( in a specific normalization ) under the difference , @xmath76 .",
    "thus we must identify @xmath77 with @xmath76 .",
    "any field in the @xmath78 representation has then a fn charge of @xmath79 , while a field in the @xmath80 representation is neutral under the fn symmetry .",
    "3 .   there may be other fields in the theory obtaining vevs that break additional gauge groups or @xmath3 s .",
    "our assumptions above mean that those vevs are of the order of @xmath57 and do not contribute to the hierarchy . to distinguish between these fields and @xmath55 , one may write the effective quiver after the higgsing of all fields except @xmath55 .      as explained above",
    ", the charges of the various fields under the fn symmetry are very restricted .",
    "this , in turn , affects the possible hierarchical structure within the quiver theory .",
    "in fact , the strongest suppression possible is by @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) and even this suppression is unlikely to actually appear , as we explain below .",
    "consider first oriented strings .",
    "as explained above , for directed quivers , @xmath55 must be stretched between two distinct branes and so its charge is @xmath83 under the corresponding @xmath84 .",
    "the fn symmetry is then @xmath85 under which @xmath55 is charged @xmath75 .",
    "any other field can be charged with one of the following : @xmath86 .",
    "thus the strongest suppression of an effective yukawa term of the form @xmath87 is obtained when all three fields are charged @xmath88 , giving an @xmath81 suppression .",
    "the corresponding quiver diagram diagram is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : s3orbifold ] .",
    "while an @xmath81-supperssion can , in principle , be generated , it is unlikely to be relevant in practice , since it requires that all three fields @xmath89 transform in the same way under the entire gauge group . in particular",

    "[ fig : s3orient ] .",

    "finally , the third case , @xmath100 , again exhibits a configuration of @xmath81-suppression , as can be seen in table [ tab : charges - orientifolds3 ] . here too , this configuration requires all three fields to be in the same representation of the non - abelian gauge groups .",

    "i.e. _ the strongest suppression of a yukawa coupling is third order in a small parameter and , for practical purposes , probably only second order  that one may wonder whether our framework gives rise to any viable flavor model at all . indeed , in the next section we show that to construct viable models , one has to invoke ( rather plausible ) non - perturbative effects .",
    "these effects relax some of the constraints that we presented in this section and , in particular , allow an @xmath102-suppression of the yukawa couplings in the case of @xmath0 gut models .",

    "we search for viable models that arise from quiver gauge theories .",
    "the theory turns out to have intriguing implications for the neutrino sector .    by an @xmath0 gut model",
    "we mean that there is a range of energy scales where the gauge group is @xmath0 , with matter fields that transform as @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the presence of an antisymmetric multiplet of the gauge group requires that we consider orientifold theories and choose the appropriate projection .",
    "this projection is the one that results in an @xmath18 gauge group(s ) .",
    "our analysis focusses on the energy scale just above the gut breaking scale . in general",
    "there can be many fields that break the various gauge groups that are present in the quiver theory .",
    "however , as discussed in the previous section , we consider a scale that is low enough so that the only field to play a relevant role in the breaking of the fn symmetry and possibly in breaking of a larger gauge group into @xmath0 is the fn field .",
    "the strongest mass hierarchy in the various fermion mass matrices appears in the up sector .",
    "thus , a minimal requirement that we put on viable models is that they produce an up mass hierarchy .",
    "this requirement significantly narrows down the possible configurations .",
    "there are two options regarding the @xmath0 gauge group .",
    "first , it could be related to a single node , namely it is a subgroup of a single @xmath16 symmetry . in this scenario ,",
    "the fields transforming as @xmath106 must have both ends on the @xmath0-related node .",
    "consequently they all carry the same @xmath107 charge , regardless of whether @xmath107 is ( i ) a subgroup of the same @xmath16 , ( ii ) unrelated to this @xmath16 or ( iii ) a subgroup of @xmath36 , where @xmath108 is related to a different node .",
    "thus , this scenario gives rise to up mass anarchy ( that is , no special structure in the up mass matrix ) and is therefore phenomenologically excluded .",
    "the second scenario has the @xmath0 gauge group related to two nodes , namely it is a subgroup of a @xmath109 symmetry .",
    "the fn field must be in the bifundamental @xmath110 of the two nodes .",

    "second , the @xmath126 terms are forbidden , rendering the neutrinos massless .    as discussed in section [ sec : anomalous - u1s ] , there are three possible solutions to this problem , which involve either extending the particle content and the symmetry of the low energy theory , or breaking the symmetry either spontaneously or non - perturbatively . before going into details , we observe that , in fact , the quiver theory gives interesting predictions that are independent of which solution to the up mass problem is employed .    indeed , since the @xmath7 fields carry @xmath84 charges of either @xmath127 or @xmath128 , at least two of them have the same fn charge .",
    "thus , there must be at least quasi - anarchy ( that is two non - hierarchical masses and one mixing angle of order one ) in the neutrino sector . in half of the models",
    "all three @xmath7 fields have the same fn charge , leading to complete neutrino mass anarchy ( no hierarchy in the masses and all three angles of order one ) .",
    "in addition , this situation , where a maximum of two possible fn charges are available to the three @xmath7 fields , has implications for the down sector : either one or all three ( in correspondence to quasi- or full - anarchy in the neutrinos ) down mass ratios are of the same order as the corresponding mixing angles ( _ e.g. _ @xmath129 ) .",
    "a word of caution is , however , in order .",
    "the above restrictions on the possible fn charges can be evaded if the @xmath5 and @xmath7-plets are composite fields . in such a case ,",
    "it is possible for all fields to carry various charges under additional @xmath3 factors , which may play the role of the fn symmetry .",
    "such a possibility , however , complicates the theory considerably and does not seem to be attractive , especially since the effective theory can not be described by a quiver .",
    "we thus assume that the sm fermions are elementary fields , while condensates can either break the @xmath99 symmetry or generate effective higgs fields .",
    "we next discuss the possibilities for solving the @xmath99 problem .",
    "we do so in the specific context of @xmath0 gut , but the solutions can be straightforwardly generalized to other gauge groups .      to allow for up - quark , higgsino and neutrino masses in a model that has the @xmath99 symmetry , one needs to add matter fields .",
    "the simplest extension has a second pair of higgs doublets@xcite .",
    "the @xmath130 charges of the four higgs fields are as follows : @xmath131 here @xmath46 and @xmath132 are fundamental fields , while @xmath45 and @xmath133 are composite",
    ".    one can now distinguish between models according to the fn charges of the matter fields , that is the three @xmath134 , the three @xmath135 , the two elementary higgs fields @xmath46 and @xmath132 , and the two composite higgs fields @xmath45 and @xmath133 .",
    "there are 640 different sets of @xmath136 charges .",
    "they are listed in table [ tab:2hm - composite ] .",
    "we now impose phenomenological requirements to see , first , if there are viable models and , second , if these models make further predictions .",
    "it turns out that requiring that the quark masses are hierarchical is enough to select a _",
    "flavor structure for all fermions and , in particular , predict the flavor structure of the lepton sector .",
    "we first consider the up sector .",
    "we require that the three up - type quarks have masses and that these masses are hierarchical .",
    "this means that no two @xmath5-plets are allowed to carry the same fn charge .",
    "out of the ten different sets of charges for the @xmath5-plets @xmath137 , only one fulfills this requirement , that is @xmath138 of table [ tab:2hm - composite ] .",
    "furthermore , the up sector couples to the composite @xmath45 . in order that the up masses do not vanish , @xmath45 must carry charge @xmath139 under @xmath140 .",
    "thus , of the four sets @xmath141 , only @xmath142 and @xmath143 are viable charge assignments .",
    "we next consider the down sector .",
    "we require that the three down - type quarks have masses and that these masses are hierarchical .",
    "out of the four different sets of charges for the @xmath7-plets @xmath144 , only one fulfills this requirement , that is @xmath145 .",
    "furthermore , the down sector couples to the elementary @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath46 must be connected to the same node as the @xmath7 .",
    "thus , of the four sets @xmath146 , only @xmath147 and @xmath148 are viable choices .",
    "we are therefore left with a unique set of @xmath76 charges , up to the choice of the charges for @xmath133 and @xmath132 .",
    "this freedom , however , only affects the @xmath4-terms and the overall scale of the neutrino masses .",
    "the flavor structure is unaffected by this choice .",
    "taking the configuration `` @xmath149 , '' we obtain the following parametric suppressions for the various entries in the fermion mass matrices : @xmath150    there are other ways to extend the matter content in order to incorporate the @xmath151 as a the symmetry of the theory .",
    "one way to generate the @xmath4-term for the @xmath125 fields , without introducing another pair of higgs fields , can be achieved in a similar fashion to the nmssm .",
    "one assumes @xmath45 is a condensate @xmath152 and introduces another field @xmath153 which is a @xmath154 condensate of the same strongly coupled gauge group .",
    "then the coupling @xmath155 is allowed , while the coupling @xmath156 which breaks the @xmath99 , may be generated by non - perturbative effects below the scale at which the @xmath157 becomes strong , or may not be generated at all , as in the mnssm @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss this idea further , and just note that , as before , the neutrino sector is predicted to be anarchical .",
    "another way to get the up yukawa terms is by breaking the symmetry through non - perturbative effects . in general ,",
    "operators which violate an anomalous symmetry are generated non - perturbatively and can be calculated using the holomorphic structure of the superpotential .",
    "it is important to note that the lagrangian of the minimal @xmath0 posseses a @xmath159 symmetry under which the fields are charged as in eq . .",
    "this @xmath159 is a subgroup of @xmath99 . in our case , of an @xmath160 gauge group , it is simple to see that if in one of the nodes , say the left , there is only a single antisymmetric @xmath5 ( and another @xmath7 to cancel gauge anomalies ) , then the related @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the coefficient in the @xmath163 function , is charged 5 under the anomalous symmetry .",
    "therefore , instantons , if exist , break this @xmath3 down to @xmath159 and can generate masses in the up sector . unfortunately , at the field theory level",
    ", no non - perturbative terms are generated in the superpotential even in this case .",
    "the reason is that the number of flavors in this model is @xmath164@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it could be that non - perturbative corrections which break the anomalous @xmath3 arise already at the string level .",
    "such corrections can not be calculated explicitly .",
    "however , they break the @xmath3 in a way that follows from the anomaly and hence may generate the required up quark yukawa couplings . assuming that these terms are indeed generated in this way",
    ", we consider the set of models where there is a single antisymmetric representation on one of the nodes .",
    "the list of the 80 possible charge assignments is given in table [ tab : instbreak ] .",
    "just as for the previous case , most of the possible charge assignments lead to a phenomenologically excluded models .",
    "we find again that up mass hierarchy requires that the three @xmath5-plets have three different charges ( @xmath138 ) , and down mass hierarchy requires that the @xmath7 and @xmath46 fields connect to the left node ( @xmath165 ) in which the @xmath3 is broken down to @xmath159 . both possible charge assignments for @xmath45 give non - vanishing hierarchical masses .",
    "note , however , that @xmath143 gives an overall suppression of order @xmath93 in the up sector .",
    "the neutrino flavor structure is again anarchical ( independent of the choice @xmath141 , though the overall scale depends once again on this choice ) .",
    "the last class of models involves spontaneous breaking of @xmath151 .",
    "this can be achieved by adding a condensate of five fields in the fundamental representations of one @xmath0 factor .",
    "this condensate includes a singlet of the non - abelian gauge group with a @xmath99 charge @xmath166 , which we denote by @xmath167 . by giving @xmath167 a vev , we break @xmath158 and allow up type mass terms .",
    "a second , conjugate , field @xmath168 is needed in order to allow for a mass term .",
    "the list of the 320 different charge sets is given in table [ tab : spontanbreak ] .",
    "the majority of the sets of charges are not viable .",
    "only two models are viable : @xmath169 and @xmath170 , where the latter , as in the previous case , has an overall suppression in the up sector . once again , anarchy is predicted for the neutrino sector .    in all three classes of models , we arrived at an essentially equivalent configuration for the matter content .",
    "the differences between the three models are just with respect to new fields that are added to solve the @xmath99 problem .",
    "this unique configuration , which leads to the flavor structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) , is presented in the quiver of fig .",
    "[ fig : swhale ] .",
    "( the theory described by this quiver diagram suffers from non - abelian gauge anomalies .",
    "a non - anomalous extension is presented in appendix [ sec : an - su5-gut ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ewhale ] . )",
    "this theory produces , at low energy , the minimal @xmath0 with the correct hierarchy in the up and down sector and with the predicted neutrino anarchy . we stress that , given our assumptions , this theory is unique and thus the anarchy is predicted .",
    "the fermion flavor parameters of the standard model have a special , non - generic structure , that finds no explanation within the standard model .",
    "the hierarchy and the smallness of the yukawa couplings are suggestive of an approximate symmetry .",
    "the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism is a simple and attractive realization of this idea .",
    "the mechanism is , however , limited in its predictive power .",
    "in particular , the fn charges are not dictated by the theory , and there is only information on the parametric suppression , but not the order one coefficients , of the yukawa couplings . in this work",
    ", we investigated whether the embedding of the fn mechanism in string theory improves its predictive power .    specifically , we examined quiver gauge theories which arise at low energy from type ii string theory with d - branes placed on singular manifolds .",
    "the quiver gauge theories can be described by ( non-)directed graphs for ( un)oriented strings , in which the nodes represent the gauge groups ( @xmath16 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) , while lines represent matter fields charged under the corresponding gauge groups .    in general ,",
    "these theories contain several anomalous @xmath3 symmetries whose anomaly is canceled by a generalized gs mechanism .",
    "the unbroken global symmetries can be used to generate the hierarchy of the yukawa couplings , thus realizing the fn mechanism . since charges of the matter fields under these @xmath3 factors are fixed by their representation under the gauge groups , the fn charges are fixed . consequently , one of the inherent limitations of fn models is removed .",
    "preciesly because it is highly predictive , the above framework does not easily lend itself to the construction of viable models .",
    "we have discussed this problem and its possible solutions .",
    "concentrating on a large class of @xmath0 gut models , we have demonstrated the predictive power of quiver gauge theories . requiring mass hierarchy in the up sector",
    ", we showed that the @xmath0 must come from an extended product group such as @xmath171 .",
    "furthermore , there must be either quasi- or full - anarchy in the neutrino sector and either one or all three down mass ratios are of the same order as the corresponding mixing angles ( _ e.g. _ @xmath129 ) . further requiring mass hierarchy in the down sector ,",
    "the fn charges of all matter fields are essentially fixed .",
    "consequently , the lepton flavor structure is predicted and , in particular , there is anarchy ( that is , no special structure ) in the neutrino sector .",

    "as we showed in section [ sec : su5-gut - models ] , all three classes of models have an equivalent configuration for the matter content , which leads to the flavor structure of eq .",

    "note that the two @xmath0 gauge groups are not asymptotically free , which is a typical problem in realizations of the fn mechanism @xcite . in our framework , however , the absence of asymptotic freedom does not pose a problem since the theory is defined at the string scale , where new heavy degrees of freedom are integrated in .",
