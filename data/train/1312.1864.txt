    "the standard model of relativistic heavy - ion collisions relies on relativistic hydrodynamics to simulate the intermediate - stage evolution of the high - energy - density fireball formed in these collisions @xcite .",

    "further , the 14 coefficients in this expansion are assumed to be linear in dissipative fluxes .",
    "however , it is not apparent why a power series in momenta should be convergent and whether one is justified in making such an ansatz , without a small expansion parameter .    the chapman - enskog method , on the other hand , aims at obtaining a perturbative solution of the boltzmann transport equation using the knudsen number ( ratio of mean free path to a typical macroscopic length ) as a small expansion parameter .",
