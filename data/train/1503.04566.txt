    "given three poses of a rigid body , there exists , in general , a unique closed kinematic loop of four revolute joints with one degree of freedom , a so - called bennett or 4r linkage , one of whose links visits the three poses .",
    "@xcite solved this synthesis problem by constructing two 2r dyads to the three given poses and proving that they can be combined to form a bennett linkage .",
    "the three pose synthesis problem for 4r linkages was re - visited by @xcite in a dual quaternion setting .",
    "a generalisation of their approach led to a factorisation theory for `` motion polynomials '' @xcite .",
    "it was used by @xcite to synthesise spatial 6r linkages  closed kinematic chains with six revolute joints  to four prescribed poses in general position .",
    "more precisely , the four poses determine two families of ( not necessary real ) rational coupler motions , each giving rise to nine families of overconstrained 6r linkages .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the construction is only capable of producing a special type of 6r linkages .    in this paper",
    "we intend to close the gap in this sequence of exact factorisation based synthesis procedures for closed loop linkages and present a construction of 5r linkages ( goldberg linkages ) to `` more than three but less than four poses '' .",
    "our synthesis algorithm is based on a characterisation of the image of open 2r chains under study s kinematic mapping and the observation that the coupler motion of a 5r linkage is also parameterised by a cubic motion polynomial ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this allows to treat 5r synthesis as a special case of above mentioned synthesis of 6r linkages .",
    "we continue this text with a quick introduction to dual quaternions and kinematics in . in",
    "we provide a geometric characterisation for the kinematic image of a 2r dyad .",
    "while necessary properties can be derived easily , the proof of their sufficiency requires more work and comprises the main part of this text .",
    "the synthesis of 5r linkage in is then merely a corollary to previous results .",

    "in this section we discuss the exact synthesis of 5r linkages , based on our geometric characterisation of 2r spaces .",

    "this conic intersects the null cone in two pairs @xmath93 , @xmath116 , and @xmath94 , @xmath117 of conjugate complex points that can be computed from the roots of a univariate quartic polynomial . again , we denote projection on the primal part by a prime .",
    "we can determine the primal part @xmath97 of @xmath100 by solving the system @xmath118 .",
    "it consists of two linear and one quadratic equation .",
    "hence , there are precisely two solutions in projective sense . picking one of them ,",
    "the primal parts of the remaining vertices can be computed unambiguously : write , for example , @xmath119 and solve @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",

    "the computation of shows that the two 2r spaces are @xmath40 \\vee [ h_1 ] \\vee [ h_2 ] \\vee [ h_1h_2]$ ] and @xmath40 \\vee [ h_1 ] \\vee [ h_2 ] \\vee [ h_2h_1]$ ] with suitable rotation quaternions @xmath54 , @xmath55 . in other words , they differ only by the _ ordering of their axes . _",
    "this shows that the figures formed by opposite axes in a bennett linkage are congruent .    in a 5r linkage",
    "there are two possibilities to assign a coupler to a fixed base .",
    "the two choices can be distinguished by the degree of their relative motion with respect to the base . as has been shown recently by (",
    "* theorem  6 ) , the degrees of relative motions between non - adjacent links in the dual quaternion model of rigid body kinematics are two and three , respectively . in order to gain additional degrees of freedoms over the synthesis of bennett linkages",
    ", it is mandatory to use the link to the degree three motion as coupler . in this sense",
    ", we can say that the coupler motion of a 5r linkage admits a rational cubic parameterisation ( a cubic motion polynomial ) in the dual quaternion model of  @xmath32 .",
    "however , not every twisted cubic in the study quadric gives rise to a 5r linkage .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition is that the coupler motion can also be generated by a 2r dyad , that is , the twisted cubic lies in a 2r space .    using the factorisation theory for rational motions @xcite ,",
    "a generic cubic motion polynomial @xmath115 can be written , in six different ways , as @xmath125 with linear motion polynomials @xmath126 , @xmath127 , that parameterise rotations about fixed axes .",
    "suitable combinations of such factorisations give an overconstrained 6r linkage whose coupler follows the prescribed cubic motion . for details on how to compute cubic interpolants on quadrics , how to factor the resulting motions and how to pick factorisations suitable for linkage synthesis we refer to @xcite .",
    "we just highlight the major differences to the case of 5r linkage synthesis .    by a fundamental property of the underlying theory , the factorisations of a cubic motion polynomial are , at least in generic situations , in bijection with the permutations of the real quadratic factors of @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "pairings for `` admissible '' kinematic chains correspond to permutations with different factors at the beginning or at the end . in the case of 5r synthesis",
    ", the situation is special .",
    "at least one factorisation is of the shape @xmath125 where either the axes of @xmath54 and @xmath55 or of @xmath55 and @xmath129 are identical . lets assume the first case",
    ". then @xmath54 and @xmath55 commute so that @xmath130 is another factorisation , different in algebraic sense but identical in kinematic sense .",
    "it can be paired with _ just two _ of the remaining four factorisations to form a closed 5r linkage .",
    "if @xmath55 and @xmath129 have identical axis , above discussion can be repeated with @xmath131 instead of @xmath115 .    for a more detailed discussion of some properties of 5r linkages in this context ,",
    "we need some results of twisted cubics that can be found in classical texts ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the intersection of a 2r space with the study quadric is a regular ruled quadric @xmath43 .",
    "it carries two families of rulings .",
    "one family contains a ruling corresponding , via study s kinematic mapping , to all rotations about the axis at the base of the 2r dyad , the other family contains a ruling corresponding to the moving revolute axes .",
    "we may accordingly speak of a `` first '' and a `` second '' family of rulings .",
    "the twisted cubics on @xmath43 can be partitioned into two classes : members of the first class intersect every ruling of the first family in two and every ruling of the second family in just one point . for cubics of second class ,",
    "the situation is just the other way round .",
    "finally , four points on @xmath43 determine two one - parametric families of twisted cubics , one of first class and one of second .",
    "a member of each family is uniquely determined by the choice of one further point on a ruling through one of the four given points .",
    "these considerations clearly show that four poses in general position can not be reached by a 5r linkage unless their kinematic images span a 2r space . on the other hand ,",
    "three poses in general position already determine , by , two 2r spaces but also a bennett linkage . by above discussion",
    ", we have three degrees of freedom to find a cubic curve through three quadric points . in other words ,",
    "the number of free degrees in 5r linkage synthesis exceed that of 4r linkages by three .",
    "unfortunately , only restricted use can be made of these .",
    "it is , for example , not possible to arbitrarily prescribe one further orientation : while there is a dual quaternion with prescribed primal part ( orientation ) in each 2r space , it will , in general , not lie on the study quadric .",
    "an additional prescribed position is prevented for similar reasons .    finally , also",
    "the appearance of two types of factorisations with commuting factors on the left ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) or on the right ( @xmath55 , @xmath129 ) can be explained by the two families of twisted cubics on @xmath43 .",
    "if the commuting factors are on the left , @xmath132 is a quadratic parameterisation of the line @xmath40 \\vee [ h_1]$ ] and every point on that line corresponds to two parameter values . in particular , there exist a second parameter value @xmath133 ( besides @xmath60 ) such that @xmath134 = [ 1]$ ] .",
    "but then @xmath135 yields a second curve point ( besides @xmath40 $ ] ) on @xmath40 \\vee [ h_3]$ ] , that is , the cubic belongs to the second family . in similar manner",
    "we see that the cubic belongs to the first family , if @xmath55 and @xmath129 commute .",
    "we characterised the kinematic image of 2r dyads and used it to specialise a recently developed synthesis procedure for 6r linkages in such a way that it yields 5r linkages .",
    "even if sufficient degrees of freedom are available , it is not possible in general to find a 5r linkage that visits three and a half poses ( three poses plus one position or one orientation ) because of geometric obstructions .",
    "thus , a natural selection of interpolation data for the envisaged coupler motion is not entirely clear .",
