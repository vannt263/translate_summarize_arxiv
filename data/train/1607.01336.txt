    ", particles made of magnetic compounds display a variety of magnetic behaviors , that differ substantially from their parent massive materials .",
    "@xcite their distinct properties are mainly connected to the finite size effects related to the reduced number of magnetic ions in the enclosed volume .",
    "@xcite additionally , the surface and interface effects related to the symmetry breaking at physical boundaries of the materials cause spin disorder and frustration along with the interparticle interactions .",
    "@xcite an interesting class of nanoparticles ( np ) is found when ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) materials are combined together in a core / shell structure .",
    "the coupling at the interface between these two magnetic phases gives rise to the eb phenomenon , @xcite which is of fundamental interest and has found multiple technological applications depending on the specific composition and the characteristic size of the respective phases .",
    "@xcite the pinning mechanism , that results from eb , has been commercially explored for the magnetic field sensors and in modern magnetic read heads .",

    "although pure metal particles would have desirable high values of saturation of magnetization , @xcite they have strong natural tendency to form parent oxide phases .",
    "@xcite this process can be controlled under proper synthesis conditions to prevent further oxidation , leading to the formation of core / shell structures with the oxide phase ( often an af or ferrimagnetic material @xcite ) usually formed at the outer part of the structures . in the case of co np , most of the published studies@xcite report the formation of the coo phase on the shell ,",
    "although in some cases the presence of the co@xmath1o@xmath2 has also been evidenced by structural @xcite or magnetic characterization .",
    "@xcite the possibility of observing eb in co based nanostructures in contact with co@xmath1o@xmath2 has been rather less investigated and the published studies focus on layered structures .",
    "@xcite synthesis of single phase coo or co@xmath1o@xmath2 np have been achieved by several authors , that have reported af magnetic behavior with ordering temperatures reduced compared to the bulk values @xcite and remanence values much higher than those for the bulk due to finite - size effects .",

    "the sizes of the crystallites forming core and shell are tuned by the controlled oxidation at different temperatures .",
    "hence , we are able to show that , the variation of shell thickness , while keeping the fixed overall particle size , leads to the significant changes in the eb effect , that are stronger for the intermediate shell thicknesses . a detailed structural study of the samples allows to correlate this maximum eb to the maximum interfacial strain due to lattice mismatch and the associated increased anisotropy . by means of atomistic monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , we trace back the origin of maximum eb effect at the intermediate size and the changes in the magnetization reversal of interfacial surface spins as core / shell size",

    "citric acid is then added to the solution and homogenized thoroughly during 6 h to obtain a transparent reddish solution .",
    "ethanolic tetraethyl orthosilicate ( teos ) is finally added to the solution as a source of the silica matrix in form of droplets and mixed vigorously for 12 h for obtaining a homogeneous solution .",
    "the final reddish solution is dried in open air very slowly to form a gel at room temperature , that is dried at 323 k for 15 days and subsequently decomposed at 873 k for 6 h in a continuous flow of h@xmath6/argon mixture ( 5% h@xmath6 and 95% argon ) .",
    "the as - synthesized co nanoparticles ( @xmath7 10 % ) in a silica matrix are processed for controlled oxidation by annealing the sample in the range of 333 - 1023 k for 10 minutes each in order to grow desired co / co@xmath1o@xmath2 phase fractions .",
    "henceforth , nine samples will be addressed as 25:2 , 24:3 , 21:6 , 18:9 , 15:12 , 10:17 , 5:22 , 2:25 , and 1:26 , where numbers are the sizes of co and co@xmath1o@xmath2 phases , respectively in nm .",

    "high resolution tem images of the particles are used to assess their size , shape and crystalline planes of co and co@xmath1o@xmath2 .",

    "0.0 cm    analysis of the xps spectra have been performed in order to investigate the details of the chemical composition of the core and shell phases of the nanoparticles .",
    "the results for the co 2p@xmath13 and o 1s contributions to xps are depicted in fig . [ fig.2](a ) for the sample with 15:12 composition .",
    "the oxidation states of co atoms are obtained by deconvoluting the spectra for co 2p@xmath13 and o 1s contributions , as shown at the top and bottom panels of the figure .",
    "the co@xmath14 , co@xmath15 and co contributions to the 2p@xmath13 spectrum can be deconvoluted as shown in the corresponding subspectra ( lines ) that exhibit maxima with increasing binding energies , respectively .",
    "a similar procedure is done for the o 1s spectrum , that can be deconvoluted into four contributions , exhibiting maxima with increasing energy corresponding to surface o , o - h , o - co@xmath14 , and o - co@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "it is noted that the ratio of the area under the deconvoluted curves of co@xmath15 and co@xmath14 in co 2p@xmath13 spectrum , as well as that of o - co@xmath15and o - co@xmath14 curves in o 1s spectrum has nearly same value of 2:1 , as expected for co@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the analysis provides a ratio of co:(co@xmath14+co@xmath15 ) @xmath16 50.3:49.7 , which is close to the phase fraction ratio of co : co@xmath1o@xmath17 52:48 , as obtained from the rietveld refinement .",

    "the behavior of the three samples is similar , showing irreversibility up to the highest measured temperature of 300 k , which indicates that the nanoparticles have blocking temperatures above this value due to their relatively large size .",
    "note that both curves decrease monotonously below 300 k and do not display any peak characteristic of the nel temperature of coo , which should be in the range of @xmath18 k depending on the particle size .",
    "@xcite the co@xmath1o@xmath2 orders antiferromagnetically around 40 k. @xcite below @xmath0 40 k , a weak anomaly can be observed in both the zfc and fc curves marked by an upturn of the magnetization , which could be ascribed to the onset of the antiferromagnetic order @xcite in crystallites forming the shell .",
    "this is consistent with the significant decrease of the nel temperature of co@xmath1o@xmath2 in the range of 26@xmath1935 k depending on the finite size effect .",
    "@xcite with increasing co@xmath1o@xmath2 fraction , the magnitude of the magnetization as well as the thermomagnetic irreversibility ( defined as @xmath20 ) decrease , as a result of the increasing contribution of shell spins with reduced magnetization , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig . 3 ] and the corresponding insets .",
    "similar low temperature responses ( not to be confused with the ones reported here ) have been reported that are usually ascribed either to residual phases @xcite in co / coo nanoparticles or onset of spin - glass freezing @xcite for other core / shell compositions .",
    "hysteresis loops have been measured in between @xmath21 20 koe at 5 k for all the nine samples , as shown by the full loops in the insets of figs .",
    "[ fig.4](a - i ) . for particles with dominant co component at the particle core ( samples 25:2 , 24:3 )",

    "[ fig.5]d).@xcite with the increase of the oxide component at the shell , the loop shapes become more elongated with higher closure fields @xcite and a high field linear component with increasing contribution .",
    "this high field susceptibility can be ascribed to the contribution of uncompensated spins in the antiferromagnetic shell and core / shell interface@xcite as it dies off at temperatures higher than t@xmath23 of co@xmath1o@xmath2 . for the most oxidized sample ( sample 1:26 )",
    "a linear field dependence extends over the whole field range as typically reported for purely antiferromagnetic nanoparticles or in bulk .",
    "@xcite    in order to probe the effect of the shell thickness on the eb effect , all the nine samples are cooled in @xmath2410 koe from 300 k down to 5 k and the magnetic hysteresis loops are recorded subsequently .",
    "the main panels in figs .",
    "[ fig.4](a - i ) show a zoom of the central portion of the hysteresis loops for zfc ( continuous lines ) and fc ( dashed lines ) protocols .",
    "note that hysteresis loops after fc appear clearly shifted to the negative fields with respect to zfc ones as a consequence of the eb coupling between the fm core and af shell spins . in some cases ,",
    "a vertical displacement is also observed .",
    "the eb field and vertical shift are defined as @xmath25 , @xmath26/2 $ ] respectively , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the coercive fields at the decreasing and increasing field loop branches .",
    "the dependence of these quantities as well as that of the coercive field @xmath4 and saturation magnetization@xmath29 on the crystallite size of the both phases is presented in figs .",
    "[ fig.5](a - d ) .",
    "0.0 cm    the most remarkable feature is the nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath3 and @xmath4 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] , which has been reported previously for co / coo nanoparticles .",
    "@xcite it is clear that eb has to tend towards zero when either the oxide shell becomes thinner or the co core diminishes .",
    "however , an argument based on finite size effects would indicate that with increasing the core diameter @xmath3 should increase resulting from the increase of surface interface .",
    "on the other hand , a decrease in the shell thickness would produce the the contrary effect .",
    "so , in order to clarify the origin of the nonmonotonic behavior , results of mc simulations will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec_sim ] .",
    "however , it should be noted that the maximum @xmath3 and @xmath30 is found for the sample with 18:9 composition , which was the one showing higher lattice mismatch .",
    "therefore , lattice strain at the core / shell interface for the intermediate shell thickness might be playing a role by inducing a higher net magnetic moment at the interface .",
    "the result is in agreement with what it has been found at the interface of au - fe@xmath1o@xmath2 composites @xcite or co / co@xmath1o@xmath2 nanooctahedra , @xcite suggesting that , lattice mismatch correlates the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "0.0 cm    this hypothesis is further sustained by the behavior of @xmath4 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5](b ) , that presents a maximum for sample 18:9 , and with the results of the mc simulations presented in sec .",
    "[ sec_sim ] .",
    "finally , we notice that vertical loop shifts indicated in fig . [",
    "fig.5](c ) are concomitant to the observation of horizontal shifts and indicate the existence of a fraction of spins that remain pinned during the field reversal ( see also the simulation results in fig.[fig.7 ] below ) .",
    "therefore , the coincidence of the maximum for both the quantities points to a relation between the increased interfacial anisotropy and stress as commented above .",
    "we have also measured the thermal variation of fc hysteresis loops by cooling the sample in a 10 koe cooling field from 300 k down to the various temperatures below 250 k and the @xmath31 dependence by cooling the samples from 300 k down to 5 k in different cooling fields up to 50 koe .",
    "the extracted @xmath3 and @xmath4 values and their variation with the mentioned parameters are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] for 24:3 , 15:12 , and 10:17 samples .",
    "the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 increase rapidly with @xmath31 initially and saturate for @xmath32 10 koe for the three selected samples .",
    "therefore , we can exclude that the loop shifts observed in our samples are due to minor loop effects .",
    "no maximum in these quantities has been detected in our samples , in contrast with what is observed in some studies of single phase oxide nanoparticles , @xcite where it was related to the glassy magnetic nature of surface spins .",
    "the results displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig.6](b , d ) show that both @xmath3 and @xmath4 decrease with increasing temperature although following different tendencies depending on the sample .",
    "remarkably , although the nel temperature of co@xmath1o@xmath2 is below @xmath33 k , the loop shifts persist up to @xmath0 250 k or above , demonstrating the robustness of the exchange coupling between core and shell and the persistence of eb effects up to almost room temperature .",
    "to sustain the experimentally observed variation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 with particle morphology , we have conducted atomistic mc simulations of a model of core / shell nanoparticle @xcite based on the following hamiltonian @xmath34 where @xmath35 are heisenberg classical unit vectors representing the magnetic ions and , in the last term , the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath36 is given in reduced units @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the atomic spin moment .",
    "note also that all parameters used in the simulations will be given in temperature units , scaling them by the boltzmann constant @xmath39 and that the simulation temperature includes a factor @xmath40 .",
    "the real values of the exchange and anisotropy constants for co and co@xmath1o@xmath2 have been used @xcite and they are given by @xmath41 k , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the interface exchange coupling has been set to @xmath44 . the total radius of the simulated particles ( containing @xmath45 spins ) has been taken as the mean radius of the real samples @xmath46 ( where @xmath12 is the lattice constant ) and nine shell thicknesses @xmath47 have been considered as studied experimentally . in order to mimick the observed presence of crystallites in the shell of the real nanoparticles ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_charact ] ) , we have divided the shell in regions with different random anisotropy directions similar to that was done in the literature .",
    "@xcite this turns out to be crucial to reproduce the experimental phenomenology .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.7](a ) we present the simulated hysteresis loops as obtained after cooling down to 0.1 k under an applied magnetic field , @xmath48 k , for different shell thicknesses .",
    "the loops display shifts contrary to the cooling field direction , that vary in a non - monotonous way with @xmath49 . with increasing @xmath49 the fraction of af spins increases . as a result of it ,",
    "the remanent magnetization decreases and the loops become more similar to that of an af material .",
    "the area of the loops decrease with an extended region having linear field dependence , in qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed behavior .",
    "0.0 cm    the variation of the eb field can be more easily traced back to the magnetization reversal behavior of the interfacial spins at the shell , @xcite whose contribution to the hysteresis loop is shown in fig . [ fig.7](b ) .",
    "as can be clearly seen , the interfacial hysteresis loops present a clear asymmetry between the decreasing and increasing field branches and , some of them , display characteristic apexes near the coercive field points.@xcite although the interface magnetization remains quite constant except near the coercive fields , the interfacial magnetization on the decreasing field branch is not equal ( in absolute value ) to that on the increasing field .",
    "this indicates that a considerable fraction of interfacial spins remains pinned during the field reversal .",
    "0.0 cm    this can be directly checked by looking at snapshots of the interfacial spins configurations taken at different points of the hysteresis loops , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] for a particle with @xmath50 . comparing the magnetic configurations at the remanent [ panels ( a ) and ( c ) ] and coercive field points [ panels ( b ) and ( d ) ]",
    ", we can see that the interfacial surface spins remain mostly oriented along the direction induced by the magnetic field applied during the initial cooling , as indicated by the absence of variation in the colors of the outer shell of spins . on the contrary , interfacial spins in contact with the core , are dragged during the quasiuniform core reversal as can be appreciated by change in color ( reddish to blueish and vice versa ) and orientation when going from remanent to the coercive field points .    in order to compare with the experimental results of fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] and [ fig.6 ] , we have calculated the coercive field and horizontal loop shifts as @xmath51 , @xmath52 from the hysteresis loops of fig .",
    "[ fig.7 ] .",
    "their dependence on the core diameter is given in fig .",
    "[ fig.9 ] .",
    "initially , both the quantities increase with increasing the particle core diameter starting from a fully af particle corresponding to the increase of the interfacial region surface , as it is also observed experimentally .",
    "however , this tendency is broken as the core size increases further and a maximum in @xmath53 is observed for a core diameter of @xmath54 nm ( shell thickness of @xmath55 nm ) . below this value ,",
    "the eb field progressively decreases as the shell thickness is reduced .",
    "this non - monotonous trend is in agreement with that observed experimentally .",
    "the observed behavior for @xmath53 correlates with the changes in the contribution of the interfacial surface spins to the hysteresis loops displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.7](b ) , where it can be seen that the change in the fraction of pinned spins decreases for the particles with thinner shells ( black , red and green curves ) as compared to the one giving maximum eb ( blue curve ) .",
    "similar trend is observed for the @xmath56 curve , which can be understood by noticing that the coercive field , at difference of @xmath53 , is directly related to the reversal of the core spins . as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig.10 ] , where a snapshot of the local changes in spin orientations between the positive and negative coercive field is depicted .",
    "the reversal of the core drags some of the inner spins at the interface , which explains the increase of @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "in contrast , spins at the outer part of the interface remain pinned , thus contributing to the loop shift .",
    "finally , let us also remark that the results of the hysteresis loops at finite temperatures for sample with @xmath58 shown in figs .",

    "<S> coupling at the interface of core / shell magnetic nanoparticles is known to be responsible for the exchange bias ( eb ) and the relative sizes of core and shell components are supposed to influence the associated phenomenology . in this work , we have prepared core / shell structured nanoparticles with the total averaged diameter around @xmath0 27 nm and a wide range of shell thicknesses through the controlled oxidation of co nanoparticles well dispersed in an amorphous silica host . </S>",
    "<S> structural characterizations give compelling evidence of the formation of co@xmath1o@xmath2 crystallite phase at the shells surrounding the co core . </S>",
    "<S> field cooled hysteresis loops display nonmonotonous dependence of the exchange bias @xmath3 and coercive @xmath4 fields , that become maximum for a sample with an intermediate shell thickness , at which lattice strain is also maximum for both the phases . results of our atomistic monte carlo simulations of the particles with the same size and compositions as in experiments are in agreement with the experimental observations and have allowed us to identify a change in the contribution of the interfacial surface spins to the magnetization reversal giving rise to the maximum in @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>"
