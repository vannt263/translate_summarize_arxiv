    "in 1970s , the discovery of black hole entropy , the four laws of classical black hole mechanics and hawking radiation revealed a mysterious but charming connection between gravitation and thermodynamics . in 1995 , jacobson derived the einstein equations as equilibrium equation of state by assuming proportionality of entropy and horizon area , and the clausius relation .",
    "since then , a large number of papers have sprung up to generalize the approach to other gravity theories @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "last year , verlinde @xcite argued the gravity is not only an emergent force , but particularly an entropy force .",
    "his work is motivated by the jacobson s work as well as the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "recently , li and his collaborators gave a new scenario of entropy force and holographic thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "first , a surface stress tensor is introduced on a holographic screen while brown - york quasi - local energy @xcite is adopted to replace verlinde energy .",
    "this tensor would give both the surface energy and pressure .",
    "then , a closed screen used by verlinde is extended to an open or closed one .",
    "finally , a time - like screen is used rather than a null screen .",
    "the thermodynamics is self - consistent and back to the jacobson s form while the time - like screen is approaching the null screen .    as an important part , chemical potential on holographic screen",
    "is discussed in detail , and specific examples are calculated in li s paper .",
    "for example , a screen sweeping vacuum outside a black hole horizon gives a form of chemical potential according to thermodynamic relations .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a different interpretation of chemical potential on holographic screen .",
    "we ponder that such holographic entropy is the entropy bound , independent of concrete matter , since the entropy is given within an ideal system .",
    "there are two reasons in favor of our point .",
    "one is the verlinde temperature is general , having nothing to do with the composition of matter .",
    "it only requires the information of metric .",
    "the other is birkhoff s theorem ensure the irrelevance between exterior metric and interior matter composition .    in section iii ,",
    "we discuss two ideal cases , each of which will lead to the entropy bound respectively . for the first case",
    ", we analyze the system with sparse but incompressible liquid like star of uniform density and then give a holographic derivation of bekenstein entropy bound . for the second case , we consider a spherically symmetric system , and compute its holographic entropy on a screen at infinity .",
    "since the temperature we use is not related to specific matter system , the entropy we obtain is not the usual statistical one ( like the black hole entropy ) . at infinity",
    ", we also can not recognize the form of system , so the holographic entropy which we calculated is the entropy bound .",
    "in this paper , we choose the natural units(ie .",
    "in this paper , we need the form of the surface stress tensor and other indispensable quantities , thus we have to review @xcitemiao:2011er , and lay the foundation of our calculation in section iii .",
    "introducing some basic definitions is beneficial .",
    "we set a 2 + 1 dimensional timelike hypersurface @xmath1 embedded in the 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( here @xmath9,@xmath10 run from 0 to 3 , and @xmath11,@xmath12 run from 0 to 2 ) denote the coordinates , metric and covariant derivatives of @xmath2 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath1 can be described by a scalar function @xmath13    analogous to jacobson s procedure @xcite , we suppose an energy flux @xmath14 passing through an open but time - like patch on holographic screen @xmath15 @xmath16where @xmath17 is the stress tensor in the bulk @xmath2 , @xmath18 is the killing vector , and @xmath19 is the unit vector normal to @xmath1 . obviously , a vector normal to @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath20 , and can be normalized as @xmath21    from the viewpoint of the holographic principle , every physical process in the bulk is corresponding to a process on the holographic screen . when an energy flux @xmath14 passes through the screen @xmath1 from the left side to the right side , the energy will change on the right side , and thus a corresponding change on the screen due to the holographic principle .",
    "the energy density @xmath22 and energy flux @xmath12 on @xmath1 take the form @xmath23where @xmath24 is the energy - momentum tensor on @xmath1 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the unit vectors normal to the screen s boundary @xmath27 ( we will give the expressions of @xmath25 and @xmath28 below eq.([mi ] ) ) , and @xmath29 is the killing vector on @xmath1 .",
    "naturally , @xmath24 should only rest on the geometry of the boundary , thus we suppose ( in miao:2011er , a more general and appropriate ansatz has been given , which , however , do not influence our discussion ) @xmath30where @xmath31 is a constant to be determined , and @xmath32 is the extrinsic curvature on @xmath1 defined as @xmath33here @xmath34 is the projection operator satisfying @xmath35 .",
    "it should be stressed that eq.(t ) is the key ansatz in this scheme to derive the einstein equations .",
    "the total energy variation on the screen then becomes @xmath36notice that there are two contributions to @xmath14 , namely the variation of the energy density @xmath37 and the energy flux @xmath12 flowing into the screen .",
    "@xmath38 is the determination of the reduced metric on @xmath39 , with @xmath8 the covariant derivative on @xmath1 and @xmath40 a unit vector in @xmath1 and normal to @xmath39 .",
    "let us choose a suitable function @xmath41 on @xmath1 to denote the boundary @xmath39 , then we have @xmath42when @xmath43 is along the direction of @xmath44(@xmath45 ) it becomes @xmath46 , and when  it is along the direction of @xmath47(@xmath48 ) it becomes @xmath49 .    from eq.([t ] ) and the gauss - codazzi equation @xmath50 , one can rewrite the eq.([ee2 ] ) as@xmath51 in the following derivations , we will only focus on the quasi - static process for simplicity .",
    "recalling that we have use eq.([fsigma ] ) to denote the holographic screen @xmath1 . in the quasi - static limit",
    ", @xmath52 is independent of time , so @xmath53 .",
    "note that @xmath54 in the quasi - static limit , thus we have @xmath55 .",
    "then the killing vector @xmath29 on @xmath1 can be induced from the killing vector @xmath56 in the bulk @xmath57 , @xmath58thus , in the quasi - static limit , we can rewrite eq.([e1 ] ) as @xmath59from the eq.([e11 ] ) and eq.([e22 ] ) , it follows @xmath60note that @xmath61 , thus we can add a cosmological constant term @xmath62 to the left of the above equation . defining the newton s constant as @xmath63 , we then get the einstein equations , @xmath64substitute @xmath65 into eq.([t ] ) , we obtain , @xmath66which is just the quasi - local stress tensor defined in @xcite . as emphasized in @xcite , @xmath24 characterizes the entire system , including contributions from both the gravitational field and the matter fields .",
    "in addition , generally , @xmath24 need to be subtracted in order to derive the correct energy .    to find the relationships between the energy in the bulk and on the holographic screen",
    ", we require a closed screen . using eq.([e1 ] ) and eq.([ee2 ] ) , together with the conservation of energy in the bulk@xmath67we get@xmath68where the fact that a closed screen has no time - like boundary has been used .",
    "this shows the relationship between the bulk energy and the energy on the holographic screen , which also make the logic in section iii complete .",
    "obviously , they differ from each other by a time independent constant at most .",
    "this constant is associated with the subtraction scheme of the energy on the screen , and generally it depends on the position of the screen . due to the constant independent of time , the subtraction scheme does not affect our derivation of the einstein equations .",
    "in this section , we follow the procedure in sec .",
    "vi of @xcite , and delve into the first law of thermodynamics on the holographic screen .",
    "let us consider a 2 + 1 dimensional holographic screen @xmath1 with a constant time slice @xmath57 . for simplicity , we will deal with the case of a static , spherically symmetric spacetime@xmath69where @xmath70 and @xmath38 are functions of @xmath71 only , and @xmath1 is a hypersurface described by @xmath72 mass is distributed around the origin point with spherical symmetry .",
    "we use the quasi - local energy in @xcite to investigate the first law of thermodynamics on screen .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "ii , an appropriate subtraction scheme for the stress tensor on @xmath1 is necessary to derive the correct energy . for the asymptotically flat space ,",
    "brown and york propose to deduct the contributions of energy from the flat background spacetime , which gives rise to the same result at infinity as the adm energy for asymptotically flat space .",
    "thus , we concentrate on spherically symmetric asymptotically flat spacetime in this section . more details of the subtraction scheme available from sec .",
    "vi of @xcite , we merely use the results without proof .",
    "we choose newton constant @xmath73 for simplicity . following the subtraction scheme used in @xcite ,",
    "the proper surface energy density on screen becomes @xmath74while the proper surface momentum density @xmath75 vanishes due to spherical symmetry .",
    "and the pressure @xmath76 , trace of the spatial stress , is @xmath77@xmath25 is the unit vector normal to boundary @xmath39 , and @xmath78is the killing vector on @xmath1.@xmath79 is the induced metric on two - boundary @xmath57 . both @xmath80 and @xmath76 are measured by observer at infinity and vanish in flat spacetime .",
    "thus , the quasi - local energy on a time slice @xmath57 is@xmath81introduce the verlinde temperature on the screen as@xmath82 then , we assume that the full form of the first law of thermodynamics on screen is @xmath83where @xmath84 is the entropy of screen , @xmath85 is the chemical potential and @xmath86 is the number of freedom . here we suppose @xmath87 as in verlinde s paper .",
    "we will discuss an ideal model in which mass density @xmath37 is a sufficiently small constant independent of @xmath71 .",
    "it suggests incompressible liquid and infinite sound speed like stars of uniform density .",
    "thus , the holographic entropy we calculate is rather the entropy bound of ordinary matter .",
    "it will give some intuitions about specific physical system .",
    "in gr , with a constant @xmath37 , there are exact solutions of metric @xcite : @xmath88@xmath89where @xmath90 is the radius of matter distribution and @xmath2 is the total mass .",
    "we initially suspend the chemical potential and assume the first law of thermodynamics on the holographic screen @xmath91using brown and york s energy definition , relative quantities are as follows : @xmath92 @xmath93    @xmath94    thus we can get @xmath95when @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 .",
    "actually , without matter , no normal entropy appears .",
    "thus , we introduce a holographic chemical potential , and then the 1st law is back to the form of eq.([law1 ] ) .",
    "then , we immediately have @xmath98this is proportional to @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which denotes the influnce of particles passing through the screen .",
    "finally , we get the entropy bound @xmath101 rather than the entropy of concrete matter .    as the second model",
    ", we place a screen sweeping vacuum at infinity in the spherically symmetric space . according to birkhoff s theorem ,",
    "no matter what the composition of matter is and how it distributes ( up to spherical symmetry ) and evolves , the geometry of outer space - time is described by schwarzschild vacuum solution , such as black hole , star system .",
    "this is very similar to the case with constant bulk density .",
    "again , the specific mathematical calculation of entropy is just entropy bound of some special physical system .    still without the chemical potential like eq.([no che ] ) , those quantities have different forms:@xmath102    @xmath103    @xmath104    the entropy is approximately@xmath105when @xmath106 , the mass @xmath2 can be treat as a small quantity , then we expand @xmath84 as@xmath107this is the bekenstein bound .",
    "the entropy @xmath108 while the adm mass @xmath109 , therefor the holographic chemical potential vanishes .",
    "the reason why we lay the screen at infinity is attributed to the non - locality of gravity .",
    "it requires an asymptotic flat spacetime to define the total energy . to include the whole physics , especially the gravity , we choose an isolated system which have infinit boundary to satisfy the asymptotic flat condition . only in this way",
    "can we obtain the entropy bound of the system .",
    "to some extent , this is coincident with two simple calculations in @xcite ( page 105 and 112 ) which show that a large @xmath71 is needed to reach the entropy bound for photons .",
    "those examples correspond concrete material system and are included in our general calculation    let us analyze the mathematical structure of the first law of holographic thermodynamics . in this paper , we just care about the physics of isolated systems .",
    "consequently we consider the adm mass @xmath2 and constant density @xmath110 are parameters rather than variables . with the only variable @xmath71 ,",
    "the holographic thermodynamic equation is totally differential .",
    "on verlinde and li s projects , gravity is treated as entropy force which is not related to elementary particles , while the chemical potential is related to the variation of the number of particles in thermodynamics . in the first model ,",
    "the screen moving outward in the star leads to the increase of particles , therefore the holographic chemical potential appears in the screen , whereas the chemical potential in the second model does not arise owing to the screen moving in the vacuum .",
    "since the specific matter constitution is not considered , the holographic chemical potential can not be deduced from the first principle in this paper .",
    "we can only judge the origin of the chemical potential from simple discussion .",
    "since the gravity is not fundamental and have no relevant elementary particles , we can relate it to phonon .",
    "the degrees of freedom are equal to the area in our convention .",
    "while the screen expanding in the vacuum , the degrees of freedom also rise without particles , thus it is contributed by the particles and gravity respectively .",
    "the effect of gravity in the holographic screen is the increasing number of modes of simple harmonic oscillation .",
    "a larger screen area implies the possibility of excitation of higher energy levels .",
    "we know the phonon have no chemical potential , therefore the screen moving in vacuum will not lead a chemical potential as the second case .",
    "having calculated these two special examples , we find that entropy bound is a natural result of the first law of thermodynamics on the holographic screen .",
    "however , more research on holographic chemical potential need to be done in future .",
