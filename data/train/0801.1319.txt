    "random young diagrams are distributed according to the _ plancherel measure _ ( on irreducible representations ) of @xmath11 .",
    "this discrete probability measure is the push - forward of the uniform distribution on @xmath11 , under the _ robinson - schensted correspondence_. schensted @xcite established that this correspondence encodes @xmath4 and @xmath9 symmetrically in the shape @xmath12 associated to @xmath10 . in @xcite ,",

    "is further evidenced by computations ( with contributions by o.  zeitouni ) of the expectation of @xmath13 and @xmath22 as @xmath21 varies ; see section  5 and the appendix .",

    "the core technical result of this paper is a generalization of the aforementioned theorem of schensted  @xcite :    [ thm : hard ] heckeshape simultaneously and symmetrically encodes @xmath4 and @xmath9 as the size of the first row and column of @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "theorem  [ thm : hard ] is obtained by establishing another new result , connecting @xmath40 to the `` @xmath0-infusion '' operation defined in @xcite .",
    "this latter result is an analogue of the classical fact that connects the robinson - schensted correspondence to the ( ordinary ) _ jeu de taquin _ rectification procedure .",

    "thus , the `` typical shape '' is @xmath46 , possessing nearly @xmath47 of the distribution .",
    "the remainder of the above results will be illustrated in section  2 , after we define heckeshape .",
    "theorem  [ thm : hard ] has some immediate consequences , familiar from the permutation case .",
    "[ cor : expectformula ] under the uniform measure on @xmath1 , we have @xmath48 in addition , @xmath49    two other consequences will be given in section  3 .",
    "one gives a `` coxeter - theoretic '' generalization of the widely known erds - szekeres theorem @xcite .",
    "another expands upon the discussion of patience sorting given in @xcite .      in our experiments , heckeshape was reasonably efficient as a sampling algorithm .",
    "for example , when @xmath50 sampling one young diagram takes on the order of seconds to minutes on current technology . for larger @xmath2",
    ", we could sample one young diagram when @xmath51 in several hours on the same technology . a sample when @xmath52 took about one and a half days .",
    "the memory demands were modest . in view of the apparent `` concentration '' suggested below",
    ", one sample was enough to be of interest for our purposes , when @xmath2 is large .",
    "there are classical antecedents of theorem  [ thm : hard ] .",
    "as stated earlier , schensted @xcite proved the analogous conclusion about the shape coming from the robinson - schensted correspondence for a permutation @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , knuth @xcite proved that the first row of the robinson - schensted - knuth algorithm ( rsk ) encodes the length of the longest weakly increasing subsequence ( @xmath23 ) of a word  @xmath10 .",
    "what is perhaps less well - known is that rsk also encodes @xmath9 as the length of the first column of the shape it associates to @xmath10 .",
    "however , unlike heckeshape , it is asymmetric : @xmath4 is not encoded by the length of the first row ( as @xmath53 in general ) .",
    "thus , the symmetry of hecke(shape ) makes it natural to analyze , as it seems desirable to simultaneously capture the statistics of @xmath13 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , we do not have handy formulas for @xmath54 , @xmath55 or @xmath56 , such as the _ hook - length formula _ for @xmath57 .",
    "( in the permutation case , the hook - length formula plays a crucial role , see @xcite . ) in small examples large prime factors appear , showing that such a formula is unlikely .",
    "for instance , @xmath58 .",
    "this issue is closely related to the open question of finding `` good '' determinantal expressions for _ grothendieck polynomials _",
    "that being said , special cases exhibit connections to work of stanley @xcite on polygonal dissections , and of @xcite on generalized littlewood - richardson rules ( further discussion may appear elsewhere ) .",
    "thus , the enumerative combinatorics of these numbers might of interest in their own right .    it is not difficult to give recursions to calculate @xmath55 and @xmath56 that are useful in moderately large cases . are there efficient ( possibly randomized or approximate ) counting algorithms ?    objectively ,",
    "the lack of simple formulas to compute @xmath54 makes it trickier to apply standard approaches directly ; this is an admitted defect of our setting .",
    "nevertheless , we believe the framework of problems described here is tractable .",
    "in addition to the results below , in the appendix one gains useful and nontrivial information about the plancherel - hecke measure by exploiting the related work of  @xcite . in this way",
    ", the techniques of @xcite can be applied to the present context .",
    "we organize our analysis by first setting @xmath59 and considering the limit behavior of @xmath33 when @xmath60 , as @xmath61 .",
    "( the case @xmath62 is trivial . )",
    "as is explained below , we conjecture that there is a * critical value * of @xmath21 , denoted @xmath63 : the behavior of @xmath33 is qualitatively different in the intervals @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 . at @xmath66 , further refinement of the analysis",
    "is needed , as we transition from one state to the other .    in the permutation case , to study the plancherel measure , it is useful to consider the most likely , or `` typical '' shape .",
    "there , three facts are true",
    ". first , in the large limit ( and after rescaling ) , a well - defined typical shape exists .",
    "second , the expectation of the lis and lds of a large random permutation is encoded respectively in the length of the first row and column of the limit shape .",
    "third , the plancherel measure is concentrated near the typical shape .",
    "we conjecture that analogues of all three of the aforementioned features also hold for the plancherel - hecke measure .    to be more precise , let the * typical shape * @xmath67 be the shape @xmath12 ( contained in @xmath68 ) maximizing @xmath54 .",
    "this young diagram @xmath67 can be interpreted as a step - function .",
    "it can furthermore be associated to a piecewise linear approximation @xmath69 .",
    "finally , rescale by @xmath70    [ conj : thebigone ]    * for any @xmath71 , there is a unique continuous function @xmath72 such that for any @xmath73 , @xmath74 as @xmath61 .",
    "we call this @xmath75 the * limit typical shape*. * a `` phase transition '' occurs at @xmath76 : + for @xmath77 , @xmath75 is the line @xmath78 + for @xmath79 , @xmath75 is the * plancherel curve * , which is parametrically given by @xmath80 ( the curves defined by ( [ eqn : line ] ) and ( [ eqn : vershikcurve ] ) are declared to be identically @xmath81 for @xmath82 . ) * for @xmath66 : there is a constant @xmath83 such that if @xmath84 then if @xmath85 , @xmath75 is given by ( [ eqn : line ] ) .",
    "otherwise , @xmath75 is given by a deformation of ( [ eqn : vershikcurve ] ) which is symmetric across the line @xmath86 .",
    "in either case , the @xmath87 and @xmath88 intercepts are at @xmath89 where @xmath90 and explicitly , @xmath91    we have reasonable support for the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) of conjecture  [ conj : thebigone ] .",
    "_ heuristically _ , part ( ii ) of the conjecture says that when @xmath21 is large , and thus @xmath92 is `` close '' to @xmath2 , a random word is `` close to '' being a random permutation . for a permutation , schensted and",
    "hecke behave the same .",
    "hence the plancherel and plancherel - hecke measures ought to be maximized on the same shape .",
    "when @xmath21 is small , the limit typical shape is a rescaling of the `` staircase shape '' which plays a distinguished role in the edelman - greene algorithm @xcite and the hecke algorithm ; see theorem  [ thm : desc ] and its proof .",
    "conjecture  [ conj : thebigone](iii ) is more speculative , since we did not have as much computational evidence for the shape of @xmath75 .",
    "there appears to be a continuous `` flattening '' of the plancherel curve to a line as we tune @xmath93 from @xmath94 to @xmath81 .",
    "our data was insufficient to rule out the possibility that @xmath75 is simply a rescaling of the plancherel curve by a factor of @xmath95 .",
    "explicitly describe the deformation of @xmath75 when @xmath66 , as @xmath93 varies .",
    "our best estimate is that @xmath96 ( probably just @xmath97 ) .",
    "however , the values of @xmath95 for @xmath93 relatively small can be experimentally estimated .",
    "the table below was based on monte carlo estimates of @xmath98 for @xmath99 and @xmath100 and the estimates were stable throughout this range .",
    "they closely agree with the conjecture for @xmath95 given above .",
    ".estimates of @xmath95 for the @xmath66 case [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig : pilesize ] shows that there is a definite shape describing the mean pile sizes as @xmath21 varies .",
    "questions about the structure of this shape may be interpreted as enriched questions related to lis .",
    "one can analyze such questions using the dichotomy of section  1.4 ; we do not pursue this here .",
    "now we show that the size of the first row of @xmath101 computes @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath102 be the largest index such that the longest strictly increasing subsequence ending at @xmath103 has length @xmath104 .",

    "we now in fact prove the following claim , which is stronger than the lis assertion of theorem  [ thm : hard ] ( cf .",
    "7.23.10 ) ) :    [ prop : refined_firstrow ] suppose @xmath15 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the insertion tableau of @xmath111 .",

    "by induction on @xmath2 .",

    "we prove the desired conclusion holds for the case that @xmath120 for some maximally chosen @xmath121 ; other cases are similar .",
    "so after inserting @xmath119 , the first row of @xmath110 is @xmath122 the assumption shows that the longest increasing subsequence @xmath123 in @xmath10 using @xmath119 is of length at least @xmath124 , since we can adjoin @xmath119 to the length @xmath104 subsequence ending at @xmath125 . on the other hand , @xmath123 is of length at most @xmath124 since if it were , say , of length @xmath126 , there must be a length @xmath124 increasing subsequence in @xmath127 ending at @xmath128 with @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "but this is a contradiction of the definition of @xmath131 since we would then have a length @xmath126 increasing subsequence ending at @xmath132 .",
    "since we have just shown @xmath133 , it is now clear that @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",

    "<S> we define and study the _ plancherel - hecke probability measure _ on young diagrams ; the _ hecke algorithm _ of [ buch - kresch - shimozono - tamvakis - yong 06 ] is interpreted as a polynomial - time exact sampling algorithm for this measure . using the results of [ thomas - yong 07 ] on _ jeu de taquin _ for _ increasing tableaux _ , a symmetry property of the hecke algorithm is proved , in terms of longest strictly increasing / decreasing subsequences of words . </S>",
    "<S> this parallels classical theorems of [ schensted 61 ] and of [ knuth 70 ] , respectively , on the _ schensted _ and _ robinson - schensted - knuth _ algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate , and conjecture about , the limit typical shape of the measure , in analogy with work of [ vershik - kerov 77 ] , [ logan - shepp 77 ] and others on the `` longest increasing subsequence problem '' for permutations . </S>",
    "<S> we also include a related extension of [ aldous - diaconis 99 ] on _ patience sorting_. together , these results provide a new rationale for the study of increasing tableau combinatorics , distinct from the original algebraic - geometric ones concerning @xmath0-theoretic schubert calculus . </S>"
