    "in general relativity of einstein there is an inherent feature of singularity at the end point of gravitationally collapsing system and has been remains an embarassing situation to the astrophysical community . to overcome this odd phase of a stellar body where all the physical laws break down , mazur and",
    "mottola @xcite proposed a new model considering the gravitationally vacuum star which was termed in brevity as gravastar , that brings up a new arena in the gravitational system .",
    "they generated a new type of solution to this system of gravitational collapse by extending the idea of bose - einstein condensation by constructing gravastar as a cold , dark and compact object of interior de sitter condensate phase surrounded by a thin shell of ultra relativistic matter whereas the exterior region is completely vacuum , i.e. the schwarzschild spacetime is at the outside .",
    "the shell is very thin but of finite width in the range @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the interior and exterior radii of the gravastar . with this unique specification",
    "we can divide the entire system of gravastar into three specific segments based on the equation of state ( eos ) as follows : ( i ) interior : @xmath4 ,  with eos  @xmath5 , ( ii ) shell : @xmath6 ,  with eos  @xmath7 , and ( iii ) exterior : @xmath8 ,  with eos  @xmath9 .",
    "the abovementioned model of gravastar has been studied by researchers which opened up a new challenges in the gravitational research to obtain a singularity free solution of the einstein field equations .",
    "therefore , it is supposed to be an alternative solution of black hole and has been studied by several authors in different context of astrophysical systems  @xcite .",
    "the negative matter density in the interior region creates a repulsive pressure acting radially outward from the centre of the gravastar @xmath10 over the shell whereas the shell of positive matter density provides the necessary gravitational pull to balance this repulsive force within the interior .",
    "it is assumed that the dark energy ( or the vacuum energy ) is responsible for this repulsive pressure from the interior . in a general consideration ,",
    "the eos @xmath5 is suggesting that the repulsive pressure is an agent , responsible for accelerating phase of the present universe and is known as the @xmath0-dark energy  @xcite . in literature this eos is termed as a ` false vacuum ' , ` degenerate vacuum ' , or ` @xmath11-vacuum '  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this context one can note that gravastar may have some connection to the dark star  @xcite .",
    "the eos for the shell @xmath12 represents essentially a stiff fluid model as conceived by zeldovich  @xcite in connection to the cold baryonic universe .",
    "the idea has been considered by several scientists for various situations in cosmology  @xcite as well as astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "einstein introduced cosmological constant @xmath0 in his field equations to make it consistent with the mach principle to obtain a static and non - expanding solutions of the universe without having any valid physical interpretation of the proposed model . in his model",
    "the constant @xmath0 with the right sign could produce a repulsive pressure to exactly counter balance the gravitational attraction and hence could keep the model of the universe static .",
    "but after the experimental verification of expanding universe by edwin hubble between 1922 to 1924 @xcite and the success of flrw cosmology made einstein realize that the universe has been expanding with an acceleration .",
    "that is why later on einstein discarded the cosmological constant from his field equation .",
    "however , though it is abandoned by einstein but for the physical requirement to describe one - loop quantum vacuum fluctuations , the casimir effect @xcite , cosmological constant had to appear once again in the theory with a form as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the stress energy tensor and the metric tensor respectively and @xmath16 is the usual newtonian constant .",
    "recent observations conducted by wmap suggests that @xmath17 of the total mass - energy of the universe is dark energy @xcite .",
    "it is believed that this dark energy plays an important role for the evolution of the universe and in order to describe the dark energy scientists have recall the erstwhile cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , in the modern cosmology this cosmological constant is treated as a strong candidate for the dark energy which is responsible for the accelerating phase of the present universe .",
    "very recently a charged gravastar in higher dimension has proposed by bhar @xcite admitting conformal motion and also by ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite without admitting the conformal motion in the framework of mazur and mottola model .",
    "these works provide an alternative solution to the static black holes .",
    "usmani et al .",
    "@xcite have also found solution of neutral gravastar in higher dimension without admitting the conformal motion .",
    "the present study on gravastar basically is an extension of the work of usmani et al . @xcite as mentioned above and its generalization to the higher dimensional spacetime in presence of the cosmological constant @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the main motivation of this work is to study the effects of the cosmological constant for construction of gravastars and also to study the higher dimensional effects , if any .",
    "the present investigations are based on the plans as follows : the background of the model has been implemented by einstein - maxwell geometry discuss in sect .",
    "2 , whereas the he solution of interior spacetime , the thin shell and exterior space - time of the gravastar has been discussed in sect .",
    "then we have discussed the junction conditions for the different regions of the gravatar in sect .",
    "4 . in the sect .",
    "5 we explore some physical features of the model , viz .",
    "proper length , energy , entropy and also study their variation with the radial parameter which followed by the discussion and concluding remarks at the end in sect .",
    "the einstein - hilbert action coupled to matter is given by @xmath19 where the curvature scalar in @xmath20-dimensional spacetime is represented by @xmath21 , with @xmath22 is the @xmath20-dimensional newtonian constant and @xmath23 denotes the lagrangian for the matter distribution .",
    "we obtain the following einstein equation by varying the above action with respect to the metric @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the einstein s tensor in @xmath20-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the interior of the star is assumed to be perfect fluid type and can be given by @xmath26 where @xmath11 represents the energy density , @xmath27 is the isotropic pressure , and @xmath28 is the @xmath20-velocity of the fluid .",
    "here in the present study it is assumed that the gravastars in higher dimensions have the @xmath20-dimensional spacetime with the structure @xmath29 , where the range of the radial coordinate is @xmath30 and the time axis is represented by @xmath31 .",
    "for this purpose , we consider a static spherically symmetric metric in @xmath32 dimension as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the linear element of a @xmath35-dimensional unit sphere , parameterized by the angles @xmath36 as follows : + @xmath37 $ ] .      in general relativity",
    "the conservation of energy - momentum is expressed with the aid of a stress - energy - momentum pseudotensor , i.e. @xmath42 and can be expressed in its general form with @xmath20-dimension as @xmath43    in the next sect .",
    "3 we shall formulate special explicit forms of the energy conservation equations for all the three regions , viz .",
    "interior , intermediate thin shell and exterior spacetimes .",
    "in the interior region of the gravastar it is assumed that the negative pressure is acting radially outward from the center of the spherically symmetric system to balance the inward pull from the shell . following mazur - mottola  @xcite ,",
    "the eos for the interior region can be provided in the form @xmath44    using eq .",

    "thus essentially we get @xmath53    using eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) one may obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) , the following relation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an integration constant .",

    "( [ eq10 ] ) it is observed that the matter density remains constant over the entire interior spacetime .",

    "so the usual gravitational mass in for a @xmath35-dimensional sphere dimension can be represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) , which is directly proportional to the radius @xmath62 and the matter density @xmath11 .    in the interior region",

    "therefore , we try to find an analytic solution within the thin shell limit , @xmath65 . to do so we set @xmath66 to be zero to the leading order . under this approximation , the field eqs .",

    "the variation of @xmath114 with @xmath40 for different dimensions is shown in fig .",
    "2 . one can note that the energy is increasing from the interior boundary to the exterior boundary .",
    "this is clearly indicating that the shell is getting harder from the interior to exterior boundary , which suggests that the exterior boundary is more dense than the interior boundary as obtained in fig .",
    "the plot also indicates that energy is decreasing as the dimension increases .      following the prescription by mazur - mottola @xcite we can use the following equation to calculate the entropy within the shell as , @xmath115        the above integration can be solved for small thickness limit @xmath116 by using the taylor series expansion and we obtain @xmath117    it is observed from eq .",

    "in the present study of grvastars with higher dimensional manifold and in the presence of cosmological constant , we have considered several aspects of the system . to examine a new model of gravastar in comparison with the type proposed by mazur - mottola @xcite , we are especially searching for its generalization to : ( i ) the extended @xmath20 dimensional spacetime from the @xmath124 dimensions , ( ii ) the einstein - maxwell spacetime geometry , and ( iii ) the cosmological constant . using the considerations ( i ) and ( ii )",

    "the variations of the parameters as shown in the plots ( figs .",

    "\\(ii ) we have calculated different parameters for three specific regions of the gravastar .",
    "all the features of the solutions suggest that the cosmological constant plays an important role for the construction of gravastars .",
    "\\(iii ) from eqs . ( 10 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 14 ) we can observe that the pressure , matter density and the metric potentials are finite at the centre ( i.e. @xmath51 ) of the gravastar .",

    "\\(iv ) the variation of the energy and the entropy is shown in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 respectively , form this figures it can be observed that both energy and entropy is decreasing with the dimensions .",
    "this in turn indicates that the shell becomes less compact and the matter density must decrease with dimensions .",
    "exactly the same nature of variation for the matter density within the shell has been observed in fig",
    "\\(v ) from fig .",
    "4 we can observe that the proper length is decreasing with the increase in dimensions , which suggests that the shell become thinner in higher dimensions . which is again well justification of the fig .",
    "1 i.e. as the matter density decreases the energy as well as the entropy will also decreases .",
    "\\(vi ) in comparison with the previous work by ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite it can be seen that the presence of cosmological constant for the construction of gravastar in higher dimensions shows almost the similar effects as observed in the presence of charge in the gravastar .",
    "this observation therefore indicates that the repulsive nature of the colombian charge and cosmological constant have the similar role in constructing gravastar .",
    "finally we can conclude that all the obtained results of the present investigation on gravastar are very much indicative that higher dimensional approach to construct of a gravastar theoretically sound and solutions are physically acceptable .",
    "however , a close observation of different profiles and plots we can conclude that the higher dimensional modeling of a gravastar does not indicate any significant difference in nature of the physical parameters from that of the ordinary four dimensional spacetime with or without cosmological constant .",
