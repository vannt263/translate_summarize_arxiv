    "we have shown in @xcite that in analogy to the electron anomalous magnetic moment @xmath1 ( being @xmath2 the bohr magneton ) shown by schwinger @xcite as due to their interaction with the virtual photon background through its self - energy , a similar effect exists for photons . due to",
    "the magnetic properties of the photon self - energy , a photon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath3 arises , which is paramagnetic in the region of transparency ( which is the region of momentum space where the photon self - energy , and in consequence , its frequency @xmath4 , is real ) .",
    "the photon magnetic moment vanishes only when its momentum @xmath5 is parallel to the magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "the photon magnetic properties are due to the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath7 expressed by the photon dispersion equation dependence on the self - energy tensor @xmath8 . but let us recall some details about the electron - positron quantum mechanics in a magnetic field .",
    "we assume some magnetic field defined by the field invariants @xmath9 , @xmath10 . in a given coordinate system ,",
    "constant uniform magnetic field @xmath6 , taken along @xmath11 , produces a symmetry breaking of the space symmetry . for electrons and positrons ( @xmath12 ) physical quantities",
    "are invariant only under rotations around @xmath11 or displacements along it @xcite .",
    "this means that the conserved quantities , i.e. , those commuting with the hamiltonian operator , are all parallel to @xmath6 , as angular momentum and spin components @xmath13,@xmath14,@xmath15 and the linear momentum @xmath16 . by using units @xmath17 ,",
    "the energy eigenvalues for @xmath12 are @xmath18 where @xmath19 are spin eigenvalues along @xmath11 and @xmath20 are the landau quantum numbers . in other words , in presence of @xmath7 , the transverse squared energy @xmath21 is quantized by integer multiples of @xmath22 . for the ground state @xmath23 , @xmath24 ,",
    "the integer is zero .",
    "quantum states degeneracy with regard spin is expressed by a term @xmath25 , whereas degeneracy with regard to orbit center coordinates leads to a factor @xmath22 , the quantity @xmath26 characterizes the spread of the @xmath12 spinor wavefunctions in the plane orthogonal to @xmath7 . the magnetic moment operator @xmath27 is defined as the quantum average of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the dirac hamiltonian in the magnetic field @xmath7 , and it is not a constant of motion . but its time - dependent terms vanish after quantum averaging and it leads to @xmath30 .",
    "obviously , it must be understood as the modulus of a vector parallel to @xmath7 .",
    "there is no a linear relation between @xmath31 and @xmath13 as it exists in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "there is also no room for conjecture the arising of a magnetic moment component in a direction different from @xmath7 .    due to the explicit symmetry breaking",
    ", the four momentum operator acting on the vacuum state does not have a vanishing four - vector eigenvalue , @xmath32 .",
    "the components @xmath33 does not commute with the hamiltonian operator @xmath29 , and are not conserved .",
    "the @xmath12 quantum vacuum energy density is given by @xmath34 , after removing divergences it gives the well - known euler - heisenberg expression @xmath35\\frac{d x}{x}$ ] which is an even function of @xmath7 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 g is the schwinger critical field .",
    "the magnetized vacuum is paramagnetic @xmath38 and is an odd function @xcite of @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath39 it is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 the fine structure constant .",
    "@xmath42 is obviously be understood as the modulus of a vector parallel to @xmath6 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath7 , is defined as such for a class of reference frames moving parallel to @xmath7 . for frames moving in other directions , for instance , perpendicular to @xmath7 , the magnetic field changes to @xmath43 and an electric field",
    "@xmath44 arises , such that @xmath45 .",
    "we do not intend to define an anomalous electric moment in that case , since it would be of pure kinematical origin ( it can be eliminated by a lorentz boost ) and for that reason , it is not interesting .",
    "most of this paper is based on a talk presented at the international workshop on astronomy and relativistic astrophysics 2009 ( iwara09 ) , which was based on @xcite , as well as some new results .",
    "we have enlarged the manuscript in some details , and discussed a new reference related to the content of @xcite .",
    "in a similar way as the definition of the electron - positron magnetic moment , for an observable photon we define the quantity @xmath46 , which is to be understood also as the modulus of a vector along @xmath6 .",
    "it can be obtained analytically from the dispersion equations for the photon in a magnetic field and it is generated by the photon self - energy tensor dependence on @xmath7 .",
    "there is no any reason to impose a priori any linear relation between @xmath0 and classical photon spin , ( or either electron - positron angular moment operators ) as has been made recently in the literature ( see @xcite .",
    "we will return later to this reference )    the diagonalization of the photon self - energy tensor leads to the equations @xcite @xmath47 having three non vanishing eigenvalues and three eigenvectors for @xmath48 , corresponding to three photon propagation modes .",
    "one additional eigenvector is the photon four momentum vector @xmath49 whose eigenvalue is @xmath50 .",
    "the first three eigenvectors @xmath51 satisfy the four dimensional transversality condition @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 is the photon four - momentum , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the external electromagnetic field tensor and its dual pseudotensor , respectively .    in reference frames which are at rest or moving parallel to @xmath6",
    "we define @xmath56 and @xmath57 as the transverse and parallel unit vectors respectively .    by @xmath58 as the electromagnetic four vector describing these eigenmodes , its electric and magnetic fields @xmath59 , @xmath60",
    "are obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that the mode @xmath61 is a transverse plane polarized wave whose electric unit vector is @xmath62 orthogonal to the plane ( @xmath63 ) . for @xmath64 ,",
    "@xmath65 is longitudinal , polarized along @xmath66 and it is a non physical mode , whereas @xmath67 is transverse , since @xmath68 .",
    "thus , in that case modes @xmath69 are superposition of waves of opposite circular polarizations .    for @xmath70 ,",
    "the mode @xmath67 becomes pure electric and longitudinal with @xmath68(and also non physical ) , whereas @xmath65 is transverse @xmath66 , as it is @xmath71 @xcite , @xcite . in that case @xmath72 , and the circular polarization unit vectors @xmath73 are common eigenvectors of @xmath74 and of the rotation generator matrix @xmath75 .",
    "the quasi - photon moving parallel to @xmath7 moves with the speed of light @xmath76 .",
    "the photon magnetic moment is identified as a 3-d vector which contains the contribution from electron - positron pairs whose spin components are oriented along @xmath6 .",
    "this is in correspondence with the fact that after solving the dispersion equations the resulting entity embodies properties of both free photons plus electron - positron pairs , leading to a composite particle which we name quasi - photons .",
    "for them , the phase and group velocities perpendicular to @xmath7 are smaller than unity , although , due to gauge invariance , quasi - photons are massless .",
    "the @xmath12 virtual pairs contributing to the photon self - energy , if considered as two - particle states , must have total spin @xmath77 , with projections @xmath78 .",
    "for the quasi - photon propagating along @xmath79 , its observable projection is only @xmath80 .",
    "we would like to stress here that the problem of a photon interacting with the electron - positron field in a magnetic field implicitly assumes a lagrangian describing the interaction of the electron - positron fields in presence of an external constant magnetic field ( furry representation ) . from the lagrangian",
    "a total hamiltonian can be written in principle as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 are respectively the hamiltonian operator for the electrons in the external field , the interaction hamiltonian of bounded electrons and positrons with the photon , and the free photon hamiltonian ( some gauge condition is assumed to be imposed ) .",
    "obviously , only components @xmath83 , @xmath13 of the total momentum @xmath84 and angular momentum @xmath13 commute with @xmath85 and are conserved along with the total energy .",
    "this is consequence of basic principles in quantum theory .",
    "the dispersion equations , obtained as the zeros of the photon inverse green function @xmath86 after diagonalizing the polarization operator @xmath87 , are @xmath88 after solving the dispersion equations for @xmath89 in terms of @xmath90 we get @xmath91    the refraction index @xmath92 can be defined as @xmath93 being different for each eigenmode , leading to the phenomenon of birefringence .",
    "the propagation of light in magnetized vacuum is thus similar to that in an anisotropic medium .",
    "gauge invariance implies that @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "thus , for parallel propagation @xmath96 . by differentiating ( [ eg2 ] ) with regard to @xmath7 we get the relation @xmath97 , and in consequence @xmath98 .",
    "the function @xmath99 is zero if the series expansion of @xmath100 in powers of @xmath7 is taken as linear in @xmath101 ( see below ) . from ( [ eg2 ] )",
    ", we have the approximate dispersion equation @xmath102 for nonparallel propagation the fact that @xmath103 is a consequence of photon paramagnetism .",
    "we will write now the explicit expressions for the photon magnetic moment found in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in the regions @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the photon is paramagnetic , since @xmath106 . in",
    "that small frequencies and weak field limit the expressions for @xmath107 were expanded in series of even powers of @xmath22 and in all positive powers of @xmath108 .",
    "we will take only the linear approximation in @xmath108 . by taking the first two terms in the @xmath109 series expansion , the magnetic moments are ,",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111      in @xcite was pointed out that in the case @xmath112 , the energy gap between successive landau energy levels for electrons and positrons is of order close to the electron rest energy .",
    "the photon self - energy diverges for values of @xmath113 .    in the vicinity of the first threshold @xmath114 and by considering @xmath115 and @xmath116 , according to @xcite , @xcite",
    "the physical eigenwaves are described by the second and third modes , but only the second mode has a singular behavior near the threshold .",
    "the photon magnetic moment found in @xcite is @xmath117    this solution is valid in the vicinity of the first threshold and agrees with the previously mentioned numerical result in its paramagnetic property , which is valid throughout the whole region of transparency ( below the first pair creation threshold ) .",
    "the expression ( [ frr1 ] ) has a maximum near the threshold @xcite , @xmath118 . by calling @xmath119^{2/3}}\\ ] ] that maximum is @xmath120^{2/3}$ ] .",
    "numerically for @xmath121 , @xmath122 .    at this point",
    "the authors want to refer again to paper @xcite dealing with topics close to the content of @xcite , but restricted to asymptotically large magnetic fields . in that paper",
    "it is imposed a linear dependence of the photon magnetic moment with regard to the photon spin in analogy to the non - relativistic electron , which is not true at the relativistic level , and it is claimed the existence of a non - zero photon magnetic moment component orthogonal to @xmath7 .",
    "this also can not be justified a priori since the symmetry is broken along @xmath7 , and a direction orthogonal to it is not related to any observable .",
    "for instance , @xmath123 , @xmath124 did not commute with the total hamiltonian @xmath85 . such alleged  perpendicular component \" , is shown in the paper @xcite to come from the scalar product of two orthogonal vectors , and in consequence _ _",
    "it is recognized as giving a zero contribution to the @xmath7 dependent part of @xmath4__. thus , that  perpendicular component \" _ comes from differentiating zero with regard to @xmath6 _ , which is mathematically nonsense .",
    "it is also argued to be obtainable by an independent procedure , which a simple analysis shows that it actually involves again differentiating zero with regard to @xmath6 .",
    "based on these results , it is claimed some precession of the magnetic moment around @xmath7 which has no basis at all ( see the appendix ) .",
    "beyond the first threshold @xmath125 , for frequencies such that @xmath126 starts the so - called region of absorption , i.e. , for @xmath127 , @xmath128 becomes complex , its imaginary part leading to complex frequencies @xmath129 after solving the dispersion equations ( the thresholds for absorption would be slightly lower if the pair resulting from the photon decay forms a bound state , or positronium .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath130 is finite on the photon mass shell @xcite and it accounts for the probability of photon decay in electron - positron pairs ( the same occurs for higher thresholds ) .",
    "thus , in this region the photon magnetic moment can not be considered independently of the created electron - positron pairs .",
    "the absorptive region is the continuation of the large frequency , large magnetic field limit to the region @xmath131 and fields @xmath132 .",
    "that region is also interesting in astrophysics , and in cosmology ( stars having fields @xmath132 and early universe ) .",
    "it is interesting , however , to remark some of the new features .",
    "for instance , although larger values are expected for the photon magnetic moment than in the region of transparency , a negative peak is found for the first threshold of the third mode .",
    "this has no absolute meaning since in that region photons coexist with electron - positron pairs ( the photon has some nonzero probability of decaying in pairs or either in positronium ) and the magnetic moment of the created electron - positron pairs ( or positronium ) must be added to that of photons .",
    "this is point is not taken into account in @xcite , where the photon magnetic moment in supercritical magnetic fields is discussed only on real @xmath4 .",
    "the magnetized vacuum background is no longer satisfactorily described by the euler - heisenberg expression @xmath133 , and radiative corrections containing the photon self - energy must be taken into account .",
    "these corrections can be written in the two equivalent forms @xcite @xmath134 , where @xmath135 , @xmath136 are the electron green function and self - energy , respectively .",
    "integration over @xmath137 must be understood as sum over landau numbers @xmath138 .",
    "appropriate counterterms must be subtracted to make these integrals convergent . by starting from the second",
    "integral , one can write @xmath139    the leading divergences are eliminated after integrating over @xmath140 . for some ranges of @xmath141 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath107 are divergent at the pair creation thresholds , getting some imaginary part and becoming complex , as discussed previously , and this suggests that quantum vacuum modes at these frequencies become unstable and decay for fields @xmath132 , in a similar way as observable photons .",
    "let s consider in ( [ omegarad ] ) only the second mode contribution coming from the first threshold for pair creation @xmath125 : @xmath142 from ( [ omegarad2 ] ) it is easy to obtain an expression for the imaginary part .",
    "we assume that @xmath143 is small in the absorptive region , where the main contribution comes from @xmath144 .",
    "thus , in the first line of ( [ omegarad2 ] ) the quantity @xmath145 from ( [ omegarad3 ] ) @xmath146 where ( see @xcite ) @xmath147 and @xmath148 is the step function .",
    "the integration over @xmath89 is extended along the half - plane @xmath149 , and for @xmath90 , in the half - plane @xmath150 . the numerical calculation of ( [ imomegarad2 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ imom ] .",
    "imaginary part of vacuum energy.,width=340 ]    by observing the figure we see that for fields @xmath151 we have @xmath152 in energy units .",
    "this would correspond to @xmath153 electron - positron pairs or photons , after the pairs decay .",
    "magnetized vacuum becomes unstable and may decay finally in electromagnetic radiation through that mechanism , for fields @xmath154 .",
    "the question immediately comes about the source of matter or energy to account for the created @xmath12 pairs or photons .",
    "we conclude that the source of the field would contribute with a compensating amount of energy .",
    "for instance , if the field is produced by a star through the dynamo effect , the vacuum decay would be produced at the expense of a small slowing down of the rotating energy , and a consequent decrease of the magnetic field intensity .",
    "magnetic energy would be transformed into radiation beams , propagating along @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the vacuum decay through the present mechanism might play a role in the @xmath155-ray emission of strongly magnetized stars .",
    "we recall also that at present qed in unstable vacuum ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite and its references ) has growing interest , and the possibility of observing vacuum decay in critical electric fields in terrestrial laboratories ( see @xcite ) is becoming realistic thanks to the development of high power pulse lasers technology .",

    "thank cesar zen vasconcellos and jorge horvath for hospitality at the international workshop on astronomy and reltivistic astrophysics ( iwara ) 2009 .",
    "the present paper is an updated version of a talk given on it .",
    "we are assuming throughout this paper the constancy of the external magnetic field ( as also is done in @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath7 varies , we are dealing with a different problem .",
    "the  demonstration \" made in the appendix of @xcite is due to a mistake .",
    "it is equivalent to the following procedure .",
    "let us start from a rotated system of coordinates where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the components ( of the spatial part ) of the magnetic field tensor @xmath158 .",
    "we have      its square is , @xmath160 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the contribution of @xmath161 to the perpendicular - to-@xmath6 magnetic moment would be proportional to @xmath162 if we assume that the limit @xmath163 can be taken , it would lead to        let us show that this demonstration has a mistake , due to the fact that it bypasses a constraint implicit in the vector product definition , since @xmath169=\\textbf{b } \\times \\textbf{k}_{\\perp}$ ] , and it implies @xmath170 .",
    "first of all let us consider the two sides of equation ( [ kfk ] ) . from the general definition",
    "we expect that @xmath171 ^ 2=b^2 k^2_{\\perp}=(b_y^2 + b_z^2)k^2_{\\perp}$ ] .",
    "thus , by comparison with the left hand side , it must be either @xmath172 and @xmath173 , or @xmath174 , must hold after some algebra , where @xmath175 is some other component of @xmath5 orthogonal to @xmath6 .",
    "let us assume that the plane @xmath176 is chosen as orthogonal to the plane @xmath177 .",
    "this selection of the coordinate system can always be done and in it only the component @xmath178 lies on the @xmath179 plane",
    ". then @xmath180 ( where @xmath181 is the polar angle of @xmath5 with regard to @xmath182-axis ) has components @xmath183 ( @xmath184 is the azimuthal angle ) and in consequence in ( [ kfk ] ) , ( [ 18 ] ) @xmath185 identically , and @xmath186 , since de derivative of zero with regard to any quantity is zero .",
    "[ last ]      we will refer to a mechanical analogy of the  perpendicular diamagnetic component \" problem : the case of a point of mass @xmath188 rotating uniformly around a center ( as a simplified version , for instance , of a planet around the sun ; we may assume the existence of a central force ) .",
    "with regard to some adequately chosen reference frame , its kinetic energy can be written as @xmath189 .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath4 is taken along the 3-rd axis , since the particle rotates in the 1,2 plane . here",
    "@xmath4 is the analog of @xmath7 . from @xmath44",
    ", we get the angular momentum , ( the analog of the magnetic moment ) @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the modulus of the angular momentum vector @xmath192 directed along @xmath4",
