    "in the 19th century , faraday showed that when the exterior of a large , enclosed cubical metallic cage ( i.e. , a faraday cage ) is electrified at such a high voltage that sparks started to dart from the corners of the cage , he could still safely conduct many sensitive electrical experiments within the cage , such as sensitive electroscope measurements of the charge residing on the interior surface of the cage .",
    "he found the complete absence of any charges residing on the interior surface .",
    "therefore in the special case of a spherical faraday cage  configuration , such as the one depicted in figure 1 , one would never expect any kind of electrical effects to be detectable inside the hollow spherical cavity which is carved out of this metallic sphere .",
    "but what is impossible classically is sometimes possible quantum mechanically . for example , a 2d , cylindrical ( i.e. , tubular ) faraday cage was used in aharonov and bohm s original paper @xcite , in which they first proposed the electric ( or scalar ) aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect .",
    "a metallic tube shielded an electron passing through the tube from any exterior electric fields .",
    "however , if a voltage pulse were to be applied to the @xmath4 of the tube only when the electron wavepacket were to be deep in the @xmath5 of the tube , then the electron could not feel any forces during its passage through the tube .",
    "nevertheless , the electron would pick up the scalar ab phase shift@xmath6 caused by the voltage  pulse @xmath7 applied to the tube whilst the electron was deep in the interior of the faraday cage .    the scalar ( electric ) ab effect",
    "is less known than the vector ( magnetic ) version of the ab effect since it is harder to achieve the situation required for the electric ab effect where fields are vanishing while the potentials are non - zero .",
    "if one considers the fields and potentials for the cylindrical faraday cage used in aharonov and bohm s original paper , then the electron will invariably pass through some region with a non - zero electric field , although the field may be extremely small .",
    "to have the electron pass _ only _ through regions where there is no field , one needs to switch the fields and potentials on and off completely , i.e. , it is necessary to consider the time - dependent fields and potentials described by equation ( [ scalar ab phase shift ] ) , where @xmath8 is a function with compact support .",
    "the existence of the scalar ab effect has been questioned ( see for example the paper by walstad @xcite ) exactly on the basis that some experimental confirmations of the effect @xcite have the interfering electron passing through regions where the electric field is non - zero , and thus ( potentially ) one could explain the shift in an interference pattern in terms of classical forces rather than as a quantum phase effect .    in this paper",
    "we are proposing two variants of the scalar ab effect as two thought experiments  which address these questions with setups where a quantum system that is influenced by potentials is _ always _ deep inside a field - free region of space .",
    "however , since both of these thought experiments  involve time - dependent potentials which have no spatial gradients , the resulting effect on the system is not a @xmath2 interference phenomenon , as in the vector ( magnetic ) ab effect , but rather a @xmath3 interference phenomenon .    from equation ( [ scalar ab phase shift ] )",
    "it can be seen that the phase in the case of the electric ab effect involves just an open time integration as opposed to the usual closed - path spatial line integral of the vector ( magnetic ) ab effect .",
    "this opens the possibility of setting up a scalar ab experiment where one does not split the system along different spatial paths , as in the vector ab setup , but instead the quantum system stays at a single location while the potential will be varying in time .",
    "since we will not be spatially splitting and recombining our system , no @xmath2 interference pattern will result , and therefore no shift in the @xmath2 fringes as in the vector ( magnetic ) ab effect .",
    "however , we shall see below that there can still be a shift in the fringes of a purely @xmath3 interference pattern , or a change of the frequency spectrum of the system .",
    "our proposal directly tests the scalar ab effect without any loopholes  that would allow for the effect to be explained any other way .",
    "the basic setup involves a spherical metallic shell ( i.e. , a faraday cage ) that has an oscillating charge @xmath9 or mass @xmath10 deposited on it . inside the shell , the potential is spatially uniform , but is time - varying .",
    "the two systems that are placed inside this shell are a josephson - circuit setup and a two - level atom . in both cases , the interior system does not move spatially and there is a complete absence of any field ( electric or gravitational ) , but the system will experience a time - varying potential energy @xmath11 which creates an observable ab effect .",
    "we present here a method to observe the electric scalar ab effect by a superconducting artificial atom @xcite . in order to shield the atom  from external magnetic fields ,",
    "as shown in figure [ 3drfsquid ] , it is confined within a superconducting faraday cage .",
    "internal scalar potential differences arise by sending rf - signals to the surface of the cage . due to the shielding of the cage , communication between the exterior and interior",
    "can only be by way of the scalar ab phase of a cooper pair , in the limit of electrostatics equilibrium established instantly all over the whole faraday cage .",
    "this assumption satisfies the fact that the skin effect on the surface of the cage does nt affect the interior . it may be possible that indications of this internal effect can also be measured by the external circuit .",
    "we demonstrate this system by considering the superconducting model circuit of figure [ squid circuit ] .",
    "an ac voltage is introduced onto the sphere by charging its self - capacitance . for a superconductor subject to a voltage @xmath7 , a phase factor @xmath12 develops within the order parameter of the cooper pair condensate , @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , a phase difference between the superconducting banks of the josephson junction also gives rise to a supercurrent according to the inverse ac josephson effect , i.e. the levinsen effect @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that the scalar ab phase allows the fully enclosed superconducting circuit to be driven by the external signal generator .",
    "circuit0602.eps    neglecting possible readout schemes for our model circuit , we construct the lagrangian using node potentials and phases @xmath14 in the standard way @xcite .",
    "node phases are related to fluxes by @xmath15 @xmath16 where flux quanta are @xmath17 .",
    "omitting bias conditions , we find @xmath18\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] considering @xmath19 is driven @xmath20 , the interior phase @xmath21 and @xmath22 become the independent variables in the lagrangian .",
    "this allows us to get the following equation of motion with driving on @xmath23.@xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 is the effective gate capacitance of the sc island and @xmath28 is the total capacitance of the system .",
    "we adopt the following initial conditions , which assume an initial steady state throughout the system .",
    "@xmath29{c}\\varphi_{2}\\left (   t=0\\right )   = \\varphi_{1}\\left (   t=0\\right ) \\\\ \\dot{\\varphi}_{2}\\left (   t=0\\right )   = \\dot{\\varphi}_{1}\\left (   t=0\\right ) \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] figure [ psi ] depicts the calculated dynamics of @xmath30 . when the floating part node 2 is initially grounded and the internal circuit is cooled down to ground state , a signal of @xmath19 drives @xmath30 starting at some moment according to the equation of motion ( [ equation of motion ] ) .",
    "hence an interior supercurrent is being driven after the signal is turned off at some point and causes a nonvanishing @xmath30 because of the josephson effect , which reflects on changing @xmath31 from the internal circuit .",
    "an rf - squid ( light blue in figure [ squid circuit ] ) at the read out port picks up the time dependent phase @xmath31 and converts it into time dependent magnetic flux which can be detected from an exterior circuit .",
    "we have therefore demonstrated that the external generator affects the fully enclosed superconducting circuit .",
    "deltaf2.eps    also notice that the internal josephson junction circuit , with the possible addition of current or flux biasing , shares a similar circuit topology to phase or flux qubits , respectively @xcite . in any case , when @xmath32 , phase is a good quantum number .",
    "the anharmonic potential energy , @xmath33 is depicted as in figure [ potential energy ] and gives quantized energy levels similar to an atom occupying the local minimas of this periodic potential .",
    "this artificial atomic system , as we have just determined , is affected by the external modulating voltage .",
    "note that the electric potential becomes @xmath34 which is the conjugate variable of @xmath35 in the hamiltonian .",
    "driving on the potential could displace the phase from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "a @xmath38 phase in the internal circuit corresponds to a flux quantum in the cavity generated by the persistent current going through the central sc wire . after releasing the driving ,",
    "the system may stay in the @xmath37 state until there is a relaxation back to @xmath36 , which can be detected via measurement of the rf - squid ( rightmost loop in figure [ squid circuit ] ) .",
    "if the driving finishes one cycle from @xmath39 to @xmath36 , the magnetic flux quantum comes back to _ zero _ in the cavity .",
    "therefore , the internal magnetic flux becomes the consequence of a temporal scalar ab effect .",
    "potentialenergy.eps    here we make the following observations :    \\(1 ) the supercurrent is created due interference between two paths for the propagation of the sc phase to node-2",
    ". one of the paths is via the jj and the other is via the solenoid .",
    "\\(2 ) the scalar ab phase discussed here is only for a single cooper pair instead of a bulk system .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the phase difference drives the supercurrent that in principle can be detected . considering the bulk system",
    ", the ab phase factor should include the phase from all cooper pairs , @xmath40 , and electrons,@xmath41 .",
    "here @xmath42 is the total number of cooper pairs ( which is not conserved in principle ) and @xmath43 is the total number of electrons of the whole system .",
    "also , ab phase factor from ionic lattice should be included as well @xmath44 . for the case of a 3d rf - squid confined within the faraday cage ( see figure [ 3drfsquid ] ) , there will arise time - varying charge imbalances between the charge of the fixed ionic lattice and the charge of the mobile cooper pairs on the sc island , which will give rise to a nonzero total ab phase developed in the internal circuit .",
    "the ab effect here merely drives the cooper pair condensate and generates a magnetic field in the internal cavity .",
    "this is the physical reaction caused by the scalar ab phase that we expect here by theoretical analysis .",
    "\\(3 ) driving the sc atom away from @xmath36 to @xmath45 becomes analogous to the case of the ionization of an atom .",
    "consequently , we can expect that treating this perturbation results in a nonlocal photoelectric effect .",
    "here we consider the problem of a two - level atom that is undergoing a time - dependent gravitational redshift when the atom is placed inside a time - varying spherical mass shell @xmath46 ( see figure 5 ) again , as in the electric case , the gravitational scalar potential will be uniform everywhere within the interior of a mass shell , so that no gravitational force will be experienced by the atom .",
    "nevertheless , there can in general arise a scalar ab phase @xcite , which arises from the newtonian gravitational scalar potential @xmath47@xmath48 where @xmath49 is the time - varying rest mass of the quantum system that is acquiring this phase shift .",
    "the newtonian gravitational scalar potential for a time - varying mass shell @xmath10 , such as that associated with the sinusoidally time - varying charge @xmath50 on the surface of the shell depicted in figure 1 , is given by@xmath51 where @xmath52 is newton s constant , @xmath53 is the radius of the mass shell , @xmath54 is the dc component of the mass shell , and @xmath55 is the amplitude of the ac component of the time - varying mass shell .",
    "it goes without saying that the mass - to - charge ratio of the electron is so tiny that the ac component associated with @xmath55 will be extremely small , so that there would be no hope for any practical laboratory experiment in connection with the faraday cage configuration shown in figure 5 .",
    "however , we are concerned here with the problem of whether _ in principle _ the gravitational ab phase exists or not , so that a thought experiment  would suffice here .",
    "nevertheless , there exist astrophysical situations , such as in the case of an exploding mass shell of a supernova , where the radius @xmath56 is the time - dependent quantity rather than the mass @xmath10 .",
    "then the gravitational ab phase shift may be large enough to be seen in practice . in any case",
    ", although the gravitational scalar potential may vary with time , nevertheless it must be independent of the position of the field point within the interior of the mass shell .",
    "this follows from gauss s theorem .",
    "therefore the atom within the mass shell experiences no classical forces .",
    "however , it can experience a nonzero quantum phase shift arising from the gravitational ab effect .     that arises from a time - dependent charge @xmath57 .",
    "the mass @xmath46 results a time - dependent gravitational redshift that leads to observable fm sidebands in the spectrum of the atom.,width=307,height=220 ]    the rest mass of the excited state of an atom or of a nucleus will be larger than the rest mass of the ground state of this atom or nucleus .",
    "this follows from einstein s equation@xmath58 in quantum mechanics , einstein s equation becomes@xmath59 thus the rest mass @xmath60 in relativity is the expectation value of the energy operator @xmath61 in quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , when an atom is in a stationary state @xmath62 , it follows from ( [ rest mass is expectation value of energy ] ) that@xmath63 and thus we recover einstein s equation ( [ e = mc^2 ] ) .",
    "we shall assume that ( [ rest mass is expectation value of energy ] ) holds in general for open quantum systems , such as that of an atom inside a time - varying mass shell depicted in figure 5 .",
    "now from the expression for the gravitational ab phase ( [ gr ab phase ] ) , we expect that the atom in a stationary state with an energy @xmath64 inside the mass shell will pick up an ab phase factor , so that@xmath65 substituting this into ( [ rest mass is expectation value of energy ] ) , we find@xmath66 which is an application of ( [ rest mass is expectation value of energy ] ) to the case of a time - dependent environment , such as the time - varying mass shell . to find @xmath67 , let us take the time derivative of the expression for the ab phase ( [ gr ab phase ] ) .",
    "then one obtains the relationship@xmath68 the physical meaning of this relationship is that the instantaneous  frequency @xmath67 associated with the modulation of the phase of the atomic wavefunction due to an instantaneous  change in the gravitational potential energy @xmath69 of the atom inside the mass shell , leads to an `` instantaneous '' energy change of the energy level of the atom given by@xmath70 upon substitution of @xmath67 from ( [ instantaneous frequency of wavefunction ] ) back into ( [ generalized einstein relation ] ) , it follows that@xmath71 from which we infer that@xmath72 which leads to the conclusion that the rest mass of quantum mechanical systems may be increased due to its external gravitational environment .",
    "if we now take the difference in the upper and lower energy levels of the two - level atom and set it equal to the frequency of an emitted photon @xmath73 times planck s constant @xmath74 , we will find that@xmath75 since @xmath47 is a negative quantity , this implies that the photon of energy @xmath76 as seen by an observer at infinity will be smaller in energy than the photon of energy @xmath77 as seen by an observer near to the atom .",
    "thus we have recovered einstein s gravitational redshift starting from the gravitational ab phase shift .",
    "now if the potential @xmath47 were to be time varying due to changes in the mass shell , the gravitational red shift would be changed by the time variation of @xmath47 .",
    "if the time variation were to be sinusoidal , then we would expect the emission and absorption spectrum of the atom to undergo fm modulation . to see this ,",
    "let us assume that the states of a two - level atom are represented by @xmath78 for the initial state and by @xmath79 for the final state .",
    "then fermi s golden rule states that the rate of transitions @xmath80  between these two states will be given by the absolute square of the transition matrix element connecting the initial and final states , i.e.,@xmath81 where @xmath82 is the time - dependent perturbation that causes the transitions to occur .",
    "( for the present purposes , we ignore the proportionality constant and the density of final states in fermi s golden rule . )",
    "let us first consider the effect of the @xmath83 scalar ab effect on the transitions between the initial and final states of a @xmath84 atom , i.e. , an ion , within the spherical shell of the faraday cage .",
    "the electric ab phase is given by@xmath85 where @xmath86 is the charge of the ion .",
    "since the initial and final states of the transition must have the same charge @xmath86 ( which follows from wigner s charge superselection rule ) , it follows that the electric ab phase factors in the transition matrix elements in fermi s golden rule must cancel out , i.e.,@xmath87 since @xmath88=0 $ ] . from ( [ invisibility of electric ab effect in atoms ] ) , we conclude that the electric ab effect can not be observed in the spectroscopy of any charged atomic system",
    ".    however , this is @xmath89 true for the gravitational ab effect .",
    "this is because of the fact that the @xmath90 @xmath91 of an excited atom will be greater than the @xmath90 @xmath91 of the unexcited atom .",
    "( recall that there exists no superselection rule for mass , unlike for the case of charge . )    now from einstein s equation ( [ e = mc^2 ] ) ,  it follows that there exists a rest mass difference between the final and the initial states of the two - level atom , which is given by@xmath92 where @xmath93 is the energy level of the final state and @xmath94 is the energy level of the initial state .",
    "therefore from ( [ gr ab phase ] ) , we see that the difference in the gravitational ab phase picked up by the final state and the phase picked up the initial state will no longer vanish , but will differ by the amount@xmath95 where , to a a first approximation , the energy difference @xmath96 is independent of @xmath47 .    as a simple example of how the difference in the gravitational ab phases in the initial and final states can lead to an observable ab interference effect , let us consider a superposition of the initial and final states which is initially given by@xmath97 after a time @xmath98 , this superposition will evolve to pick up phase factors , viz.,@xmath99 where@xmath100@xmath101 are the gravitational ab phases picked up by the initial and final states , respectively . from ( [ difference in ab phases ] ) and ( [ superposition state at t = t ] ) it follows that@xmath102 where @xmath103 is the difference of the two ab phases . from ( [ gr ab phase ] ) and ( [ dc and ac components of m(t ) ] ) , we see that@xmath104@xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the fm modulation parameters for the initial and final wavefunctions , respectively , of the two - level atom .",
    "the sinusoidal modulations of the phases given by ( [ phase modulation of initial state ] ) and ( [ phase modulation of final state ] ) will lead to many fm harmonics of the frequency @xmath108 via the jacobi - anger expansion of the wavefunctions of the two - level atom ( see appendix a ) .",
    "for large values of @xmath109 and @xmath110 , the dominant upper and lower fm sidebands of the fm - modulated wavefunctions of the atom will occur at the frequency shifts @xmath111 and @xmath112 away from their usual frequencies of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "it follows that the usual energy - conservation - enforcing delta function in the fermi golden rule will be modified from the usual two - level atom resonance condition not only by the usual gravitational red shift stemming from the dc component of the mass shell @xmath54 , but it will also be modified due to the fm sidebands that arise from the ac component of the time - varying mass shell @xmath10 .",
    "the bottom line of this analysis is that the usual absorption or emission line of the two - level atom will be split into upper and lower fm sideband frequencies occurring on either side of the unsplit line of the atom with frequency shifts of @xmath115 , where@xmath116 is the difference between the fm modulation parameters of the final state and the initial state that stems from the difference in their rest masses , @xmath117 .",
    "we conclude from the above two counter - examples  that the claims of the non - existence of the scalar ab effect are false .",
    "although these two counter - examples  are by nature merely thought experiments ,  they do establish the @xmath118 of the electric ab effect and the @xmath118 of the gravitational ab effect _ in principle_. however , they may ultimately lead to actual experiments in the laboratory in the josephson interferometry case , and to actual observational evidence in astrophysical settings in the gravitational redshift case .    finally , we note that the magnetic ( vector ) ab effect as observed by tonomura @xcite using ferromagnetic toroids in electron interference experiments , are obviously topological in nature .",
    "however , the electric and gravitational ( scalar ) ab effects that are predicted to occur here inside the metallic shells of figures 1 and 5 , are obviously non - topological in nature .",
    "consider the general case in which the potential energy inside the faraday cages depicted in figures 1 and 5 satisfy the periodicity condition in time@xmath119 where the period @xmath120 is that of an arbitrary periodic waveform generator that replaces the sine - wave generators in figures 1 and 5 .",
    "then it is apparent that this temporal periodicity condition is mathematically identical to the spatial periodicity condition@xmath121 that applies to a 1d crystalline lattice with a lattice constant @xmath122 .",
    "bloch s theorem @xcite then tells us that the wavefunction inside the 1d crystalline lattice is given by@xmath123 where @xmath124 is the crystal momentum  or quasi - momentum , and where@xmath125 is a periodic function of @xmath126 within the spatial crystalline lattice .",
    "similarly , the temporal version of bloch s theorem ( also known as floquet s theorem ) is given by@xmath127 where @xmath64 is the crystal energy  or quasi - energy  @xcite@xcite , and where@xmath128 is a periodic function of @xmath129 within a certain temporal crystalline lattice .",
    "@xcite  ( we have suppressed the spatial dependence of the wavefunction @xmath130 and of the periodic function @xmath131 as being understood in ( [ bloch s theorem temporal form ] ) .",
    "this also applies to all of the following expressions for @xmath130 and @xmath132 ) .",
    "both the crystal momentum  and the crystal energy  are _ physically observable quantities _ that obey _ conservation laws _ , because of the discrete translational symmetry of the crystalline systems in @xmath126 and in @xmath129 , respectively , which follow from the translational symmetry of ( [ temporally periodic potential energy ] ) and ( [ spatially periodic potential energy ] ) .",
    "since @xmath131 is a periodic function of time with a period @xmath133 , it can be expanded by fourier s theorem into a fourier series expansion@xmath134 where @xmath135 are the fourier coefficients of @xmath131 , and where @xmath136 is the frequency of periodic charge waveform @xmath137 that is being injected onto the surface of the faraday cage in figures 1 and 5 by the arbitrary periodic waveform generator . substituting ( [ fourier series expansion of u(t ) ] ) into ( [ bloch s theorem temporal form ] )",
    ", one finds that@xmath138 so that we conclude that@xmath139 which describes the quasi - energy  levels @xcite  of any charged quantum system inside the cavity of a faraday cage which is being driven by an arbitrary periodic waveform .",
    "note that this derivation of the spectrum of quasi - energy levels ( [ quasi - energy level spectrum indexed by n ] ) applies to the case of @xmath140 periodic potential energy function @xmath11 .",
    "however , let us now consider the important special case of a @xmath141 time variation of @xmath11 .",
    "the wavefunction of a quantum system inside the faraday cage such as the ones depicted in figures 1 and 5 , will be phase modulated by the time - varying potential energy in accordance with the time - dependent schrdinger equation@xmath142 where the @xmath143 is the total hamiltonian , @xmath144 is the unperturbed hamiltonian , and @xmath11 is the potential energy of the quantum system inside the spherical shell , which results , for example , from the injection of the charge @xmath9 onto the surface of the spherical metallic shell ( i.e. , faraday cage ) in figure 1 .",
    "note that @xmath145 will be independent of the position of any field point in the volume within the shell .",
    "thus@xmath146 for the case of an oscillating charge @xmath147 which is @xmath4 to the faraday cage .",
    "however , any field arising from the spatial gradients of @xmath11 @xmath5 to the space containing the quantum system is zero .",
    "now we shall assume that the quantum system is initially in an unperturbed eigenstate of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath144 , i.e.,@xmath148 where @xmath64 is the unperturbed energy level of the system .",
    "since @xmath149   = 0 $ ] , it follows that the solution to the time - dependent schrdinger equation is@xmath150 where @xmath151 is the phase shift of the wavefunction of the system which is associated with the scalar ab effect , i.e.,@xmath152 in agreement with ( [ scalar ab phase shift ] ) and ( [ gr ab phase ] ) . using the explicit functional form of ( [ u(t ) ] ) in order to evaluate this integral , we find that@xmath153 where the fm depth of modulation  @xmath154 parameter is defined as follows:@xmath155    thus we find that the wavefunction of the system in the presence of the @xmath5 potential energy @xmath11 , which iscaused , for example , by the @xmath4 charge @xmath9 , will have the form@xmath156 now from the generating function for bessel functions , one obtains the jacobi - anger expansion @xcite@xmath157 where @xmath158 is the @xmath159 order bessel function of the argument @xmath154 .",

    "positive values of @xmath160 will correspond to upshifted - frequency sidebands , and negative values of @xmath160 to downshifted - frequency sidebands in the quasi - energy spectrum .    substituting the jacobi - anger expansion into the wavefunction ( [ fm modulated wf ] ) ,",
