    "the effect of short - range correlations ( src ) to the one - body properties of nuclei is an old but challenging and appealing problem . in general , the account of src is important for the description of the mean values of some two - body operators , such as the ground state energy of nuclei but it is also of interest to investigate the src contribution to simpler nuclear quantities related to one - body operators such as the form factor ( ff ) , density distribution ( dd ) and momentum distribution ( md ) .",
    "it has been shown that mean - field theories can not describe correctly md and dd simultaneously @xcite and the main features of md depend little on the effective mean - field considered @xcite .",
    "the reason is that md is sensitive to short - range and tensor nucleon - nucleon correlations which are not included in the mean - field theories .",
    "we note however that the choice of a single particle potential having a short range repulsion could play a role in improving somehow the values of md @xcite .    the experimental evidence obtained from inclusive and exclusive electron scattering on nuclei established the existence of a high - momentum component for momenta @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is well known , that the independent - particle model ( ipm ) fails to reproduce the high momentum transfer data from electron scattering in nuclei .",
    "that is , the ipm is inadequate to reproduce satisfactorily the diffraction minima of the charge ff for high values of momentum transfer .",
    "therefore , although single - particle potentials of the type mentioned above , that is with a short - range repulsion lead to certain improvement , theoretical approaches which take into account src due to the character of the nucleon - nucleon forces at small distances , are necessary to be developed .    in this effort",
    ", two main problems appear .",
    "the first one is the type of src which must be incorporated to the mean - field nucleon wave function and the second one is the type of cluster - expansion to be used which is connected with the number of simultaneously correlated nucleons .    in the present work we consider central correlations of jastrow type @xcite while three different cluster expansions are considered .",
    "the first two types of expansions , named fiy ( factor , iwamoto and yamada ) @xcite and faht ( factor , aviles , hartogh and tolhoek ) @xcite respectively , were developed by clark and co - workers @xcite while the third one named loa ( low order approximation ) was derived by gaudin , gillespie and ripka @xcite .",
    "the fiy expansion , truncated at the two - body terms , was used for the calculation of the charge ff and dd @xcite and md @xcite in @xmath9-@xmath10 and @xmath9-@xmath11 shell nuclei while the loa , truncated at the two - body terms and including a part of the three - body term , was used for the calculation of the above one - body quantities in the closed shell nuclei @xmath12he , @xmath13o and @xmath14ca @xcite as well as of the bound - states overlap functions , separation energies and spectroscopic factors in @xmath13o and @xmath14ca @xcite . the faht expansion , truncated at the two - body terms",
    "was used for the evaluation of the charge ff @xcite and nuclear ground state energy of @xmath12he and @xmath13o @xcite . in the present paper the faht expansion",

    "the above mentioned three types of expansions are applied and compared for the one - body characteristics of @xmath9-@xmath10 and @xmath9-@xmath11 shell nuclei .",
    "the comparison of the three truncated expansions can be made , as usually , by comparing @xmath6 ( in computing the ff ) i.e. the smaller the @xmath6 , the better the quality of the corresponding expansion . in the present work",
    "we introduce also an information - theoretical criterion in addition to @xmath6 .",

    "here we apply this idea to compare various cluster expansions .",
