    "in the analysis of the first data obtained in proton - proton collisions with centre of mass energy @xmath3 tev at run 2 of the lhc , the atlas and cms collaborations both reported an excess of events in the invariant mass distribution of two photons near 750 gev @xcite .    if confirmed by the bulk of the run 2 lhc data in the near future , this excess indicates the existence of a new boson @xmath0 with mass around 750 gev , that decays into two photons . assuming that this is indeed the case , and not a statistical fluctuation",
    ", we may finally have the first hint of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this tantalising possibility led to an unprecedented explosion in the number of exploratory papers dedicated to the 750 gev di - photon resonance .",
    "the atlas collaboration analysed 3.2 1/fb of data and reported an excess of 14 events at the di - photon invariant mass of 750 gev , with a best - fit width of approximately 45 gev .",
    "the quoted statistical significance of the atlas excess is 3.9 @xmath4 or 2.3 @xmath4 including the look - elsewhere effect .",
    "the cms collaboration reports an excess of 10 di - photon events with a narrow - width peak at around 760 gev and a lower statistical significance of 2.6 @xmath4 .",
    "the cross - sections for the observed di - photon excess were estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) as @xmath5 which we will take to be 8 fb . the di - photon resonance @xmath0 must be a boson thanks to the landau - yang theorem . in this work",
    "we will neglect the possibility of a spin - two particle and focus on a spin - zero state  a scalar or a pseudo - scalar .",
    "as in most of the di - photon literature we will also assume the mass and the width of the @xmath0 to fit the atlas data , thus in total , ^obs_pp x = 8 fb , m_x= 750 gev , _ tot= 45 gev , though the observational evidence for the latter feature of a relatively large total width @xmath6 , is not strong ; consequently in most of our numerical estimates in the next section we will indicate an appropriate scaling factor between the 45 gev value and a generic @xmath7 .    at first sight @xmath0 appears to be very similar to the standard model higgs ",
    "it is produced in @xmath8 collisions and its decay modes include the @xmath9 channel .",
    "hence it is natural to expect that it is dominantly produced from initial protons via the gluon - gluon fusion process ( plus contributions from quark - anti - quark annihilation ) and then decays into two photons .",
    "however , because it is six times heavier than the standard model ( sm ) higgs , the new boson @xmath0 provides an interesting complication to model - building  it requires the addition of new mediators between @xmath0 and the sm , contributing to _ both _ the production and the decay process .",
    "one can not hope to utilise any of the sm fermions either in the loop of the gluon fusion production of @xmath0 , or in the @xmath10 decay loop .",
    "since @xmath11 is above all of the sm fermion - anti - fermion thresholds , @xmath0 bosons produced on - shell would rapidly decay into fermion - anti - fermion pairs at tree level , thus wiping out the corresponding @xmath12 and @xmath13 branching ratios which are loop suppressed .",
    "hence , both parts of the assumed @xmath14 process , the gluon fusion , and the di - photon decay have to be generated entirely by new heavy mediators with @xmath15 propagating in the loops .",
    "futhermore , the mixing of a scalar @xmath0 singlet with the sm higgs must be severely suppressed @xcite , @xmath16 . in summary",
    ", the entire parton - level process must be generated by beyond sm ( bsm ) physics with no input from the standard model beyond just providing the external states .",
    "in addition , the yukawa couplings of @xmath0 to the mediators that are required to accommodate the observed di - photon rate for a 45 gev resonance are already pushed to large values and become non - perturbative not much above the tev scale @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we follow an alternative more minimal approach where the @xmath0 ( pseudo)-scalar communicates only to the @xmath17 hypercharge factor of the standard model . in this case",
    "one does not require separate bsm - enabled production and decay mechanisms .",
    "this idea that the di - photon resonance couples to photons but not gluons was put forward in two pioneering papers  @xcite already on december 17 2015 , and considered further in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main theoretical challenge facing this ` pure photon ' set - up is that the di - photon channel is subdominant , being suppressed by @xmath18 relative to the gluon fusion rate  and this , as we will briefly review in section * [ sec : estimates ] *",
    ", puts the model in dangerous territory , with a combination of non - perturbative couplings , very large numbers @xmath19 of mediator flavours and very low scales of new physics .",
    "we will propose that these short - comings can be resolved by allowing a lepton mediator that feels large extra dimensions .",
    "the resulting tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states quite easily enhances the di - photon rate sufficiently to match with observations . in section * [ sec : model ] * we will examine the effect in various dimensions determining how the photon - fusion rates match with the expectations for the observed di - photon resonance .",
    "following that , in section * [ sec : p ] * we will derive additional constraints on the uv - cutoff of the theory by requiring perturbativity of the gauge coupling .",
    "even though the assumptions about the content of the theory are the most minimal , we find that a significant window remains to fit the di - photon signal in perturbative settings .    the effect of radiative corrections on the scalar boson mass and its finite naturalness are discussed in section * [ sec : mx ] * , in a framework where a supersymmetric theory is compactified down to 4d with scherk - schwarz boundary conditions . following this , in section  * [ sec : dark ] *",
    ", we address the additional invisible decays of @xmath0 to @xmath9 , that can account for the full total width @xmath20 gev , and hence enable the di - photon resonance to play a role as mediator between the sm and dark matter ( dm ) sectors .",
    "finally section  * [ sec : conc ] * presents our conclusions .",
    "for a ( pseudo)-scalar of mass @xmath11 and width @xmath7 one can express the di - photon cross - section using the standard narrow - width approximation expression , _ pp x ( s)= ( _ i = g , q , c_ii _ xii ) _ x [ eq : narw ] where the sum is over all partons and @xmath21 are the dimensionless integrals over the corresponding parton distribution functions .",
    "for example for gluons @xmath22 at 13 tev was estimated in @xcite as @xmath23 , for quarks @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and for photons @xmath26 .",
    "we now concentrate on the case where the @xmath0 boson is coupled only to photons , thus keeping only @xmath27 in the sum on the right hand side of .",
    "in fact , one should also consider corrections to this process sourced by the photon pdf integral @xmath27 , by the ` vbf ' type processes , which are proportional to quark pdfs @xmath28 with each of the initial quarks emitting a photon .",
    "a very rough estimate for the relative importance of this effect would be @xmath29 , using the values quoted in @xcite . while a detailed calculation of such effects is beyond the scope of this paper",
    ", we will take the above estimate as a hint that the corrections to the leading photo - production process are relatively small and as a result the presence of additional jets ( in the vbf case arising from the initial quark partons ) is suppressed relative to what one would expect for a heavy higgs - like scalar production in the standard model .",
    "photon - photon fusion in elastic @xmath8 scattering as searches of new physics was considered even earlier in ref .",
    "but in the weakly - coupled sm - like settings , the branching ratio of a scalar resonance to photons is tiny , and hence the rate for such processes is negligible .",
    "for example , the sm higgs production via photon fusion in elastic @xmath8 collision is only @xmath30 fb @xcite .",
    "the next step is to account for contributions from inelastic as well as elastic @xmath8 collisions . following refs .",
    "@xcite we will express the answer in the form _ pp : x ( 13 tev ) 10 pb ( ) ( br_x)^2 .",
    "[ eq : xc ] the numerical factor @xmath31 pb on the right hand side includes the contribution from the integral over the parton distribution functions of the photons in the initial state protons . as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , this factor can suffer from a large theoretical uncertainty and arises from accounting for inelastic collisions where one or both initial protons gets destroyed after emitting a photon .",
    "the estimates for @xmath32 obtained in the recent literature give @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and the most recent calculation @xcite gives @xmath36 .",
    "( an even earlier estimate made in @xcite , which was based on the ( subdominant ) elastic @xmath8 collisions , gives the rate suppressed by two orders of magnitude relative to . )",
    "the overall factor of the order-10 pb is perhaps on the optimistic side , but for the purposes of our work which aims instead to enhance the @xmath37 fractions , it will not be critical if the overall coefficient in is reduced .",
    "the photon fusion cross section computed in the same manner at @xmath38 tev in @xcite is roughly a factor of 2 smaller than the corresponding @xmath39 tev result in , which is consistent with the absence of the di - photon resonance signal in run 1 lhc searches .    to match the signal rate quoted in -",

    "thus , we see that to reproduce the experimental signal ( or excess ) attributed to the di - photon resonance with @xmath41 gev and @xmath46 gev in terms of the _ photon fusion _ process on its own , would require the introduction of new physics degrees of freedom already at the electroweak scale , i.e. @xmath47 , which is obviously at odds with the experiment .",
    "if the total width of the di - photon resonance turns out to be much less than 45 gev , the value of @xmath43 will be rescaled as indicated in . what is the minimal possible value of the total width ?",

    "this gives an infinite tower of kaluza - klein states of vector - like leptons populating the loops and , as we will show in the following section , leads to an appropriate enhancement necessary ( and sufficient ) to photo - produce the observed di - photon rate .",
    "at the same time , the kaluza - klein lepton tower also contributes to the coupling constants of the theory which , not surprisingly , exhibit power - like ( rather than merely logarithmic ) growth at energies above the kk mass threshold .",

    "as outlined in the introduction , to address these shortcomings we wish to consider a kk tower of vector - like leptons coupled to photons and to @xmath0 . in the simplest scenario , we take the new leptons to extend into the bulk of a @xmath71-dimensional theory @xcite with @xmath72 flat compact extra dimensions .",

    "thus we have a rough estimate m_x^2 ~ m^2 _ , where @xmath148 is the photino mass in the standard model . the finite naturalness bound for the 750 gev scalar",
    "would then imply an upper bound on the photino mass of m _",
    "( 4/ ) m_x ( 1/ ) 110 tev , which should not cause any problems with the current limits .",
    "let us also comment on the soft masses of the scalar leptons @xmath149 .",
    "these are susy - breaking contributions first generated at two loops in @xmath150 by back reaction from the standard model .",
    "analogously to ordinary slepton mass - squared soft terms in gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking , we can parameterise these contributions as , m_l_sc^2 ~ m^2_soft sm , where @xmath151 are the slepton masses in the standard model . even at 100 tev a hypothetical sm slepton would result only in a @xmath152 gev contribution compared to the mass of @xmath149 , which does not impose any significant phenomenological constraints .",
    "having generated the required @xmath153% branching ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath9 necessary to explain the di - photon excess observed by atlas and cms in terms of solely photon - photon fusion and decay , both mediated by a tower of kk states of vector - like leptons , we now address the remaining 97% of the 45 gev total width of @xmath0 .",
    "an obvious and interesting possibility is that the di - photon spin - zero state @xmath0 decays into dark matter particles .",
    "more generally @xmath0 can decay invisibly into any particles of the dark sector , which includes but is not necessarily limited to cosmologically stable dark matter . over the last two years so - called simplified models describing scalar and pseudo - scalar mediators to dark sectors and their searches at the lhc @xcite and future hadron colliders @xcite have attracted a fair amount of interest .",
    "the role of the 750 gev resonance as the possible mediator to dm was studied in the recent work , including refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the simplified models describing elementary interactions of spin - zero mediators with the the dark sector particles , which for simplicity we take to be dirac fermions @xmath154 , @xmath155 , contain the interactions @xmath156 the partial decay widths of @xmath0 into these fermions ( for a single flavour ) are given by [ eq : gs ] _",
    "= m_x(1-)^ , _ = m_x(1-)^ , for the scalar and the pseudo - scalar cases respectively .",
    "it is straightforward to achieve 97% of the 45 gev @xmath7 from these decays alone .",
    "for example for @xmath19 light dm fermions one would need n_f^1/2 g_dm 1.21 , which is easy to accommodate in a weakly coupled theory .",
    "it is also possible , if so desired , to arrange for dm particles to propagate in large extra dimensions assuming that the lowest kk modes are kinematically accessible to the 750 gev particle .",
    "three comments are in order .",
    "first , following the same logic as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we will not insist that the relic density of the dark sector fermions computed using the lagrangian in eq .   should match the observed cosmological abundance of dm .",
    "such calculations have already been carried out elsewhere , e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite , but more importantly , it is also possible that the dark sector particles @xmath154 are only the distant parents of the cosmologically stable dm and can undergo further decays .",
    "our second comment is that for searches of these dark sectors at the lhc which are mediated by the @xmath0 particle produced via photon fusion , the standard strategy of jets plus missing energy searches used in @xcite will not be directly applicable .",
    "the reason is that at the partonic level the process @xmath157 is entirely electromagnetic and we expect that additional qcd jet activity will be suppressed numerically ( as already mentioned in section * 2 * ) .",
    "finally , one should ensure that the new heavy leptons do not themselves introduce stable charged matter that violates cosmological and astrophysical bounds .",
    "this requires either sufficiently low reheat temperatures , small freeze - out densities or perhaps decay through higher dimensional operators .",
    "see for example refs.@xcite .",
    "we proposed a scenario where the spin - zero 750 gev state is coupled to a new heavy lepton which lives in the bulk of a higher - dimensional theory and interacts only with the photons of the standard model .",
    "we found that they allow for a minimal and compelling explanation of the di - photon resonance via photo - production and decay .",
    "the central role in this effect is played by the summation over the kaluza - klein modes of these leptons appearing in the loops of the @xmath1 production and decay subprocesses .",
    "the set - up requires only a minimal extension of the standard model in the sense that the same mechanism is used for the production and the decay of the @xmath0 resonance . with the new lepton",
    "being coupled only to the @xmath17 gauge sector in the standard model one can explain the absence of other resonances at 8 and 13 tev in the vicinity of the 750 gev di - photon invariant mass .",
    "the decay channel into @xmath158 is suppressed by @xmath159 , while other potential candidates , such as two jets , @xmath160 and 2 leptons are either absent or suppressed by powers of @xmath150 .",
    "this feature is particularly important for suppressing standard model jets which would otherwise accompany the di - photon production mediated by @xmath0 .",
    "since at the parton level the entire @xmath161 process is electromagnetic , any additional qcd jet activity would be suppressed by extra powers of @xmath150 or a combination of @xmath162 ( for the vbf process ) relative to the @xmath27 factor in our leading order photon fusion process .",
    "thus the relative absence of additional jets which would accompany the di - photon resonance if it was produced in gluon fusion relative to the case of pure photo - production considered here , is a distinguishing feature of our model .",
    "similarly , while mono - jet searches disfavour a large invisible width @xmath163 gev , this conclusion @xcite does not apply directly to our model , as the mono - jet would have to originate e.g. from a quark in one of the initial protons @xmath164 in addition to the photon which participates in the photon fusion .",
    "this is again suppressed by the fine structure constant times the corresponding ratio of pdfs .    at the same time , the approach presented here can be easily applied to the case where the di - photon ( pseudo)-scalar @xmath0 is produced in the gluon fusion channel . in this case",
    "one would simply substitute the vector - like lepton by a single species of a new quark @xmath54 , @xmath165 in the bulk of an extra - dimensional theory .",
    "the di - photon rate in the gluon fusion process would of course be greater relative to the photon fusion , and will be even easier to fit in our kk model .",
    "the extension of the standard model by a new spin - zero singlet state @xmath0 also sits very well with other items on the bsm wish list : @xmath0 can play the role of the inflaton  as the singlet degree of freedom which is non - minimally coupled to gravity  see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it can also help to stabilise the sm higgs potential @xcite , assist the first order phase transition and provide additional sources of cp violation for baryogenesis .",
    "finally as was already noted in section  * [ sec : dark ] * , a ( pseudo)-scalar @xmath0 is also an obvious candidate for being a mediator to the dark matter sector @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to valery khoze , alberto mariotti , misha ryskin and michael spannowsky for useful discussions and comments .",
    "this work is supported by the stfc through the ippp grant , and for vvk in part by the royal society wolfson research merit award .",
    "the expressions that one derives in the effective field theories are dominated by two elements : the kk tower and the magnitude and nature of the uv cut - off . in view of the latter",
    ", one should check that these approximations adequately model what happens when a uv completion is added to the theory .",
    "we have already argued that the physical manifestation of the uv finiteness of string theory is typically equivalent to a simple cut - off on schwinger integrals , and that this in turn is equivalent to inserting factors @xmath166 in otherwise divergent kk sums .",
    "however we would like briefly to confirm that this expectation holds for the wilson coefficient we are interested in . a simple equivalent calculation to the field theory one can be performed in the heterotic string , where the uv cut - off is simply understood as a consequence of modular symmetry . in general one can find the wilson coefficient by obtaining the threshold corrections to @xmath150 from the two - point function of the photon in the standard way , but inserting the resonance as continuous wilson line backgrounds @xmath167 ( that break some non - abelian gauge symmetry ) around compact dimensions @xmath168 . the standard starting point is therefore @xmath169.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 refers to the charges , and @xmath170 refers to spin structure on the two cycles of the torus where @xmath171 is the @xmath172-scale ; of course this is not required for the current problem . ] .",
    "the integration over the real part of the modular parameter , @xmath173 , projects onto physical states , while the integral over the imaginary part , @xmath174 is precisely equivalent to the schwinger integral in field theory , with the fundamental domain @xmath175 providing a natural cut - off .    expanding in the canonically normalized @xmath0 fields corresponding to the wilson - lines , @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the radius of the dimension associated with wilson line @xmath0 , and neglecting the exponentially suppressed string modes as well , we find @xmath178 where the formfactor of interest arises from the @xmath179 cross - term with @xmath180 .",
    "a non - negligible result requires @xmath177 to be small ( in other words we did nt need to resum that dimension ) , leading to a formfactor of order @xmath181 in agreement with the field theory .",
    "note that the compactification was somewhat asymmetric , but the crucial factor was the appearance of the bulk volume in string units @xmath182 , which had to be orthogonal to the wilson line .",
    "a similar situation holds in any situation where there is a large bulk volume dependence in the hypercharge gauge thresholds .",
    "for example in type i or type ii models with d - branes , the dependence of threshold corrections on wilson lines and/or d - brane displacements has been examined in the literature in various contexts , for example @xcite .",
    "the typical dependence goes as @xmath183 where @xmath184 is now the brane displacement , @xmath185 is the volume of neumann directions , and @xmath186 the volume of dirichlet ones . as for the previous example",
    ", we can expand for small displacements and recover a wilson coefficient proportional to the volume .",
    "we should note in this context that there has been some interest in the 750 gev di - photon as a pseudo - scalar axion that participates in generalized green - schwarz anomaly cancellation ( i.e. it appears as a closed string r - r state in the wess - zumino d - brane action ) @xcite .",
    "that possibility can be understood also entirely within an effective field theory in which heavy chiral modes are integrated out due to a large yukawa coupling @xcite .",
    "however in the present case where we consider the state to be a scalar coupling to kk modes , it would correspond to a _ dilatonic _",
    "closed string mode , more along the lines of the scalar proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally it is interesting in this context naively to estimate parameters under the assumption that the vector - like leptons and @xmath187 all occupy the same relatively large volumed d - brane .",
    "then one has @xmath188 with @xmath189 and @xmath190 denoting volumes of the respective branes in string units @xcite , leading to an estimate of m_d ~ ( ) ^2 ~ y()^2 , assuming @xmath191 .",
    "given the possibility of non - zero scherk - schwarz contributions to supersymmetry breaking , it is interesting to ask what contributions to the @xmath0 scalar mass can arise from the kaluza - klein lepton tower in .    like the 5d coupling computed earlier in @xcite the result",
    "is expected to be finite , but in this case for arbitrary dimensions due to the spontaneous nature of supersymmetry breaking in scherk - schwarz mechanism .",
    "as we shall see , the soft - masses are dominated by the kk modes and consequently the field theory calculation contains all the necessary physics provided the compactification radii are relatively large compared to the fundamental scale .",
    "( in other words any string calculation would yield the same result . )    to see this explicitly , and to obtain precise results for arbitrary dimensions , let us briefly derive the soft - mass of the scalar in field theory using the earlier schwinger approach .",
    "the object of interest is m_x^2 = y^2 _ .",
    "using schwinger parametrization each integral is of the form _ _",
    "0^(-t(+m_d^2))- , and poisson resumming as before we find @xmath192e^{-m_{d}^{2}t-\\mathbf{\\bfell}^{2}\\pi^{2}r^{2}/t}.\\ ] ] the terms with zero @xmath106 vanish ( thanks to the supersymmetry being spontaneously broken ) and the integral is then rendered finite ( hence no uv regularisation is required ) .",
