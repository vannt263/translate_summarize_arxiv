    "the problem of how to treat theoretically systems of interacting electrons in disordered materials extends over many decades .",
    "the most difficult problems to solve are ones in which the physical properties of interest depend on spatial correlations of individual realizations of the disorder potential . in this case , the majority of disorder - averaged approximations fail and more sophisticated analytical or numerical techniques are required . anderson localization and coulomb gap physics are two examples of such problems@xcite .",
    "the problems are particularly challenging in narrow band materials where conventional approximations for the coulomb interaction are poor.@xcite    there has been particular interest in low - dimensional disordered systems in recent years . for example , many transition metal oxides , especially the quasi - two - dimensional high temperature superconductors,@xcite are intrinsically disordered by chemical doping , and have electronic properties that appear to be strongly susceptible to disorder .",
    "more recently , experiments have demonstrated the formation of a two - dimensional electron gas at the interface of an otherwise insulating la@xmath0cuo@xmath1/sr@xmath0tio@xmath1 heterostructure,@xcite and there are indications that the electronic states at the interface are strongly influenced by inhomogeneities.@xcite a more fundamental question that has arisen in the past decade is whether interactions may drive a delocalization transition in thin metal films.@xcite    theoretically , we can investigate the relation between disorder and electron - electron interactions by studying the anderson - hubbard ( ah ) hamiltonian .",
    "the ah model is the hubbard model@xcite for a lattice with site energies chosen from a random distribution @xmath2 where @xmath3 denote the sites of the lattice , @xmath4 implies that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are nearest neighbours , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the destruction ( number ) operator for an electron at site @xmath5 with spin @xmath9 and the hopping energy is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the on - site energy at site @xmath5 is given by @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the electron repulsion of two electrons sharing the same site .",
    "the only known exact solution for the ah hamiltonian is in infinite - dimensions,@xcite and we thus have to use approximate methods in finite dimensions .",
    "the various approximate methods used previously include self - consistent hartree - fock theory,@xcite dynamical mean field theories,@xcite and exact numerical calculations for small clusters.@xcite of particular relevance to the current work is a recent variational wavefunction approach by pezzoli _ et al_,@xcite which we discuss below .    here",
    ", we consider a variational wavefunction approach , based on a modification of the gutzwiller wave function ( gwf)@xcite to include spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "the gwf is the simplest variational wave function for hubbard - type hamiltonians and is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a reference product ( i.e.  slater - determinant ) state .",
    "this function was originally introduced to study the correlations of the ground state of the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the variational parameter @xmath15 incorporates the effect of the hubbard repulsion between electrons of opposite spins on the same site , and is obtained by minimizing the energy functional @xmath16 we note that @xmath17 corresponds to an unprojected wavefunction , while @xmath18 corresponds to a fully projected wavefunction in which there are no doubly - occupied sites .",
    "physically , the @xmath18 projection captures an essential feature of the large-@xmath12 hubbard model : it generates local paramagnetic moments without breaking the spin - rotational invariance of the lattice .",
    "the gwf is hard to treat analytically , even for the disorder - free hubbard",
    "hamiltonian where analytical results have only been obtained in one@xcite and infinite@xcite dimensions .",
    "the variational gwf is therefore primarily a numerical method.@xcite our goal is to investigate the quality of a number of simple variational wavefunctions by comparison of the variational ground states with exact diagonalization calculations on small clusters .",
    "the gwf has certain well - known limitations:@xcite it fails in the disorder - free case , for example , to describe the mott transition at half - filling in finite dimensions . in general",
    ", the gwf can be improved by the addition of nonlocal jastrow factors that describe the long - range interactions between charge - density excitations.@xcite recently , pezzoli _ et .",
    "al._@xcite used variational methods to study the ah hamiltonian in two dimensions .",
    "their particular focus was on states near the mott transition , which necessitated the inclusion of the jastrow factors .",
    "furthermore , they included spatial inhomogeneity in both the product state @xmath19 and in their local variational factors ( e.g. @xmath20 ) .",
    "these extra degrees of freedom resulted in a large number of variational parameters ( several hundred for a typical lattice ) and required sophisticated minimization schemes for the energy functional.@xcite it is therefore worth asking under what circumstances we can safely reduce the number of variational parameters and still obtain reasonable results for the variational wavefunction .    in the current work ,",
    "we examine trial wavefunctions with a small number of variational parameters .",
    "spatial inhomogeneity is incorporated in the product state wavefunctions @xmath14 , however , the variational parameters are taken to be spatially homogeneous .",
    "our main result is that for weak and intermediate disorder , this simple wavefunction gives a surprisingly good description of the ground state away from the mott transition .",

    "a consequence of saturation is that the impurity potential is only partially screened at large @xmath12 .",

    "the gwfs used in this work make two key simplifying assumptions : first , that the correlation physics is approximately local and can be represented by a gutzwiller partially - projected wavefunction and , second , that the spatial inhomogeneity associated with the disorder potential can be incorporated entirely within the uncorrelated product state . in this section , we discuss these two assumptions , keeping in mind that , while it is possible to treat a large number of variational parameters using statistical sampling methods,@xcite many of the interesting questions relating to disordered systems require the ability to study large system sizes , and that it is therefore desirable to restrict the number of variational parameters as much as possible . the results shown in this paper give some clues as to how this can be done .",

    "it appears as if , for @xmath135 , spatial inhomogeneity can be adequately incorporated in the product state provided that screening is included , either through a hartree - fock determination of the product state or through a variational parameter .",
    "this represents a huge savings of computational effort since , if one makes a physically reasonable ansatz for the form of the jastrow factor , the number of variational parameters can be reduced to four : a screening parameter @xmath47 , a projection parameter @xmath48 , and a pair of parameters for the jastrow factor.@xcite    for strong disorder , the situation is different since spatial fluctuations of the charge density are significant .",
    "it appears that , in this case , spatial inhomogeneity can not be included solely in @xmath137 , but must be included in the variational parameters as well .",
    "this was the approach taken in ref .   where the local variational parameters @xmath48 and @xmath47 were allowed to vary from site to site ( but the nonlocal jastrow factors were treated as spatially homogeneous in order to reduce the computational workload ) on lattices of @xmath138 sites .",
