    "recently , radiation - induced vanishing magneto - resistance observed in high - mobility 2deg has attracted a great deal of attraction@xcite .",

    "the idea of negative resistance(conductance ) was originally invoked long time ago by ryzhii@xcite .",

    "subsequent theoretical works explained the negative resistance in terms of the radiation induced change of electron distribution@xcite .",
    "an alternative way of explanation of the `` zero resistance '' exists . based on a semiclassical approach using a phenomenological damping parameter , iarrea et al .",
    "directly proposed vanishingly small positive resistance@xcite . according to ref.@xcite",
    ", the physical origin of the zero resistance is that the electric current is blocked by pauli exclusion principle when the  fermi level \" oscillates sufficiently .",
    "so far , most of theoretical study has been based on the perturbation analysis .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the radiation - induced electron transport without relying on the perturbation analysis .",
    "we will not use fermi golden rule for the transport which sometimes gives ambiguous conclusion on the validity of the theory .    by this means , we study the magneto transport of electrons in landauer geometry .",
    "the effects of landau level broadening are realized via finite guiding center potential and the finite bias gives rise to the shift of the density of states .",
    "we do not assume equilibrium function for a localized states defined by magnetic fields . because when disorder in 2deg play a role in magneto transport , ( quasi-)extended states opens transport channels@xcite therefore the occupation of a localized state do not follow fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "we found the negative conductance in consistent with the previous calculations showing negative resistance @xcite .",
    "our model study indicates that    \\(i ) the negative conductance indeed exists even in purely quantum mechanical calculations without perturbation analysis .",
    "\\(ii ) if the magnetic orbitals open transport channels via disorder scattering , the pauli exclusion principle do not ensure the zero conductance",
    ".    we also investigated the nonlinear effects and the breakdown of the negative conductance as a function of dc bias .",
    "we analyze the radiation induced non - equilibrium distribution functions for temperatures lower than landau level spacing .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model and related formalism for the calculations of transport properties . in section iii , we show the linear negative conductance indeed exists in certain conditions .",
    "it will be shown that , however , if the dc bias do not change the density of states , there is no negative conductance .",
    "the nonlinear properties will be presented in section iv , and the radiation induced non - equilibrium distribution function will be presented in section v.",
    "we consider a 2deg confined in a cylinder with radius r subjected to a transverse magnetic field @xmath0 .",
