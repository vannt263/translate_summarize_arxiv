    "a simple prototype example is the system of lattice electrons subject to a ( perpendicular ) strong random magnetic flux ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rf ] ) . an electron hopping from one site to the next acquires a field dependent phase which , if the field is strong enough becomes completely random . under these conditions",

    "notice that the definition ( [ h_rf ] ) implicitly assumes that all energies are measured in units of the modulus of the hopping matrix elements .",

    "( however , it is important to recognise that the denotation ` random flux model ' is , to some extent , misleading in the sense that the hamiltonian ( [ h_rf ] ) does _ not _ actually model a short range correlated random magnetic field but rather the lattice version of a random _ vector potential_. the difference can be of importance since a short range correlated field would imply the presence of _ long _ range correlations in the vector potential  @xcite . keeping this difference in mind",
    "we nevertheless continue to refer to ( [ h_rf ] ) as a random flux hamiltonian . )    the random phase hamiltonian ( [ h_rf ] ) , describing the lattice dynamics of _ scalar _ fermions , can straightforwardly be generalized so as to accommodate fermions with an internal structure : let us assume that a ) the lattice fermions carry an internal quantum number , @xmath18 such as , e.g. , spin and b ) that the fundamental hopping mechanism leads to a full randomisation of the internal states . under these circumstances , the hamiltonian ( [ h_rf ] ) generalises to ( c.f .",

    "the generalized rf - model has applications in both condensed matter and high energy physics :    _ physics of manganese oxides : _ suggestions have been put forward to explain the effect of giant magnetoresistance , shown by transition metal oxide compounds , in terms of effective models consisting of lattice electrons hopping in a matrix of localised @xmath31 core spins@xcite .",
    "the hopping process is essentially influenced by the hund s rule coupling between the spin of the itinerant electrons and the localised spins . in the limit where the coupling strength becomes infinite ,",

    "more precisely , the model ( [ h_rf ] ) bears similarity with a lattice anderson hamiltonian with strong disorder in the hopping matrix elements .",
    "being hermitian but not real , the hamiltonian ( [ h_rf ] ) is expected to fall into the general class of models with unitary symmetry . in particular , all states might be expected to be anderson localised . as will be discussed below",
    ", this picture is correct as long as one stays away from zero energy : * _ the middle of the tight binding band _ , @xmath42 .",
    "in the band center , the hamiltonian ( [ h_rf ] ) possesses a discrete symmetry which , as will be explored in detail below , heavily influences the physical properties of the model . the nature of the symmetry can easily be understood by inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : rf ] : the essential point is that the hamiltonian of the rf problem is of pure nearest neighbour type .",

    "symmetries of the type ( [ chiral2 ] ) are commonly referred to as _",
    "chiral symmetries_. + the existence of a chiral symmetry has far reaching consequences for the physics of the model at the band - center . before turning to a more comprehensive discussion of this point ,",
    "let us summarise a few elementary facts that follow straightforwardly from the definition of the model .",
    "firstly , we note that the hamiltonian is _ always _ chiral , i.e. not just in the band center .",
    "one may then ask why , for finite energies , the chiral symmetry is ineffective .",
    "the reason is that the information about both thermodynamic and transport properties of the system is encoded in the single - particle green function @xmath50 rather than in the hamiltonian itself ( here @xmath51 ) .",
    "now , @xmath52 i.e. the inversion property under adjungation with @xmath49 is broken by finite @xmath53 .",
    "some physical implications of this symmetry breaking will be discussed in detail below .",
    "+ secondly , we note that stochastic hamiltonians with a chiral structure have previously been studied in the random matrix literature  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that they belong to symmetry classes that are fundamentally different from the standard wigner dyson classes .",
    "in particular , the band center rf model belongs to the universality class of the so - called ` chiral gue ' , chgue  @xcite . for finite @xmath53 , the model undergoes a symmetry crossover from chgue to ordinary gue symmetry .",
    "+ to the best of our knowledge the full extent of the consequences of the chirality of the rf model was first noticed in a seminal paper by miller and wang  @xcite .",
    "* beginning with lee and fisher  @xcite , there has been intensive research into the anderson localization behaviour of the model .",
    "so far the question whether or not all states are localised has not been conclusively settled : despite extensive numerical and analytic studies , opinion is divided between those who conclude that all states are localised  @xcite , and those who believe that delocalised states persist at the center of the band  @xcite . below we will provide further evidence for the existence of a metallic phase in the middle of the band . needless to say ,",
    "the phenomenon is induced by the unconventional symmetry of the model .",
    "by contrast , for finite @xmath53 , the model can be shown to map onto the standard anderson model of unitary symmetry which is known to be localised in dimensions two and less . for weak random magnetic fields ,",
    "this connection has already been established microscopically in ref .",
    "+ besides the localization behaviour , several other physical properties of the rf system are affected by the chiral symmetry .",
    "in particular the presence of the symmetry gives rise to non - trivial quantum - interference corrections to average _ single_-particle properties such as , e.g. the density of states .",
    "some of these features will be discussed below .",
    "the subject of this paper is the construction of an effective field theory describing the low energy / long range properties of the generalized random flux model ( [ un_h ] ) .",
    "some emphasis will be placed on exploring the consequences of the chiral symmetry of these systems .",
    "specifically , it will be shown that the random flux model maps onto a field theory of a structure similar to that constructed earlier by gade  @xcite in connection with _",
    "weakly _ disordered sublattice models introduced by oppermann and wegner@xcite .",
    "both the symmetries and the structure of gade s field theory are known to be essentially influenced by chirality . in particular ,",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) flow of the theory is drastically different from the one observed in conventional low dimensional disordered systems .",
    "indeed , the fact that the rf models ( [ un_h ] ) and the wegner / oppermann sublattice systems of broken time reversal invariance , respectively , map onto the same field theory might have been anticipated from the outset , the reason being that the latter represents the maximally disordered counterpart of the former . on the field theoretical side , the main _ difference _ between the models lies in the value of the coupling constants .",
    "the consequences of this difference for the large scale analysis of the rf model will be discussed below , after the field theory has been microscopically derived .",
    "a second difference to gade s analysis is that the present construction will be based on the supersymmetry formalism ( as opposed to gade s boson replicas ) .",
    "as will be discussed below , the supersymmetric formulation enables one to explicitly demonstrate that the ergodic limit of the model is described by chiral random matrix theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start out from a qualitative explanation for the importance of the chiral symmetry in section [ sec : qualitative ] .",
    "the central sections [ sec : cf ] and [ sec : effective ] contain the derivation of the long range field theory of the model . in section [ sec : eval ] we discuss what kind of physical predictions follow from the field theoretical modelling .",
    "to clarify our discussion , much of the technical content of the analysis has been moved to appendices .",
    "prior to embarking on the quantitative analysis of the rf model , it is instructive to develop some intuition regarding the consequences of the presence of the chiral symmetry .",
    "perhaps the most apparent manifestation of the symmetry is the non - triviality of ensemble averaged _ single - particle _ properties such as the dos : as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite within a perturbative renormalization group scheme , the dos of the two - dimensional ( weakly disordered ) sublattice model diverges upon approaching the middle of the band .",
    "the same type of behaviour has been predicted for one - dimensional chiral systems  @xcite . that these results can , in fact , not hold true all the way down to @xmath42 follows from exact random matrix theory  @xcite . the random matrix analysis which , by general symmetry arguments , is expected to effectively describe the ergodic limit of chiral problems ( i.e. the asymptotic vicinity of the band center ) yields a _ vanishing _ dos at @xmath42 . since the breakdown of the dos takes place on an energy scale set by the level spacing , it is generally difficult to detect within perturbative approaches .",
    "in fact it is known , for example from the conceptually related analysis of the level - spacing gap in the dos of superconductor / normal metal systems without proximity effect  @xcite , that a non - perturbative level spacing gap may signal its presence in terms of spurious _ divergences _ appearing in perturbative analyses . thus , judging from perturbation theory alone , it may be difficult to tell what part of the band center dos divergence is ` real ' and what is merely an unphysical repercussion of a tiny non - perturbative effect .",
    "as will be discussed in more detail below , the complex behaviour of the dos finds its origin in the fact that , in chiral models , mechanisms of large scale quantum interference  which are commonly represented by diffusion - type modes like ` diffusons ' and ` cooperons '  already operate on the level of single - particle properties .",
    "this should be contrasted with the situation in conventional disordered models where the average green function picks up a largely structureless imaginary self energy but otherwise is not affected by the disorder .    to understand why the dos of the rf model behaves unusually in the band center",
    ", it is not even necessary to invoke the concept of diffusion modes .",
    "a simple path counting argument analogous to that employed by brinkman and rice  @xcite is sufficient : consider the average dos per unit volume , @xmath54 , represented in terms of the single - particle green function , @xmath55 where the outer brackets represent the phase averaging @xmath56 expanding in powers of @xmath57 and inserting lattice resolutions of unity , @xmath58 , we obtain @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the linear extension of the lattice and @xmath25 the lattice spacing .",
    "the expression @xmath61 has the meaning of the total phase acquired during the propagation along the path @xmath62 ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig : self_ret ] ) .",
    "the second equality in ( [ dos_path ] ) states that the contribution of all paths with a non - vanishing total phase averages to zero .",
    "the surviving @xmath63-phase paths are self retracing  indicated by the symbol ` s.r . ' . in the third equality",
    "we have used the fact that the total number of self retracing paths of length @xmath0 is @xmath64 .",
    "evidently , the summation over @xmath0 in the last line diverges for @xmath65 , indicating a breakdown of perturbation theory in the vicinity of the band center .",
    "notice that the presence of @xmath63-phase paths is intimately connected to the sublattice structure of the system .",
    "no analogous contribution to the mean dos of conventional ( on - site ) disordered systems exists .",
    "a second and more formal way of demonstrating the non - triviality of single - particle properties is based on a few algebraic manipulations of the single - particle green function . introducing a system of pauli matrices in the two - component @xmath45-partition",
    ", the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 and both @xmath68 and @xmath69 are hermitian .",
    "similarly , the green function can be represented as @xmath70 the point now is that the central matrix can be interpreted as a retarded and an advanced stochastic green function @xmath71 and @xmath72 , coupled by the operator @xmath73 . since the the manipulations with the matrices @xmath26 and @xmath49 do not affect the structure of the singularities of the green function , we conclude that the single - particle @xmath74 has the effective complexity of _ two _ coupled stochastic green functions . in particular , we can anticipate that the average @xmath74 will be affected by mechanisms of quantum interference between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "notice that both large energy arguments @xmath53 and on - site matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( corresponding to diagonal blocks in the @xmath45-partition ) would lead to a destruction of this two - particle coherence .",
    "after these general considerations , we proceed to the quantitative study of the generalized rf - problem .",
    "our general strategy parallels that employed by zirnbauer  @xcite in a loosely related study of the mapping of the chalker - coddingtom network model of the integer quantum hall effect onto the effective field theory proposed by pruisken .",
    "as a first step towards the construction of a field theory of the rf problem , we need to introduce some degrees of freedom capable of describing the long range features of the model ( [ un_h ] ) .",
    "a mathematical tool for mapping model systems governed by unitary stochastic operators onto functional integrals containing a ` low energy ' sector describing the large distance physics has recently been introduced and applied by zirnbauer  @xcite . for reasons that will become clear below",
    ", the transformation has been christened the ` colour - flavour transformation ' .",
    "our application of the colour - flavour transformation to the @xmath4 rf - model closely parallels the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite of the spectral properties of _ single _ @xmath4 matrices . for this reason",
