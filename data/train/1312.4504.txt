    "the nuclear magnetic properties of solid and liquid @xmath0he are studied extensively since the 70 s , and demonstrate an amazingly rich panel of phenomena : from the ideal ( neutral ) fermi liquid , the bcs _ p_-pairing superfluid , to the magnetic orders u2d2 and cnaf in the solid , associated to their peculiar excitations ( a non exhaustive list being particle - hole , spin waves , homogeneously precessing domain , etc ) @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional low temperature physics of quantum solids originates in adsorption experiments @xcite .",
    "the study of the magnetic properties of confined @xmath0he have followed very rapidly the first results on the bulk liquid @xcite .",
    "it became soon obvious that a few layers of @xmath0he were adsorbed on the immersed surfaces , and formed a `` 2d - like '' solid .",
    "especially , with graphite substrates ( which present very large surface areas to the adsorbate ) ideal 2d magnetic behaviour has been reported : for instance in the heisenberg ferromagnetic 2d solid , in accordance with the mermin - wagner theorem , no phase transition is detected at finite temperature and finite field @xcite .    with the advent of a new type of porous substrates , namely the silica aerogels , a renewal of the confined @xmath0he studies occured in the middle of the 90 s @xcite .",
    "an aerogel is a net of strands formed of roughly 3 nm diameter silica spheres .",
    "the average distance between strands lies in the range 30 - 170 nm , which corresponds to samples having porosities lying between 95 % and 99 % .",
    "moreover , the structure of the net is fractal over typically two orders of magnitude in lengths .",
    "+ the typical 70 nm size of the aerogel pores makes these samples particularly interesting for @xmath0he physics .",
    "indeed , this lengthscale is of the same order as the superfluid coherence length , which enables to strongly suppress the superfluid transition @xcite .",
    "thus , one can study the effect of a controlled ( fractal , with no lattice ) disorder introduced in a perfect bcs superfluid . on the other hand ,",
    "the fermi liquid properties are not affected @xcite , since their relevant lengthscale is atomic , @xmath2",
    ". however , the transport properties are strongly modified , since the network of strands limits the mean free path of thermal excitations @xcite .    in these confined experiments ,",
    "the behaviour of the liquid and the adsorbed solid at the level of the boundary layer is an intriguing and important question .",
    "indeed , the features observed in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr , the lineshape in continuous wave , and the t@xmath3 and t@xmath4 relaxation times in pulsed experiments ) are directly linked to the fluid - solid interaction @xcite .",
    "even the state of the matter at the level of the boundary has been questioned @xcite : first of all , is it a liquid or a solid ?",
    "if it is a liquid , is it a `` ferromagnetic liquid '' ? or are the two spin baths unchanged , with simply a weak liquid / solid exchange due to the overlap of their wave functions ? + moreover , the boundary effects between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic domains is of ubiquitous interests in physics : they appear here in @xmath0he nmr experiments , but can be exploited with esr ( electron spin resonance ) @xcite for metallic micro / nano layered structures .",
    "the model of `` fast exchange '' was rapidly proposed to explain the results obtained on confined @xmath0he @xcite . based on ideas developed by m.t .",
    "bal - monod and coworkers @xcite , it explained the distorsion of the superfluid nmr lineshapes @xcite , the linear in temperature relaxation time @xmath5 @xcite , and the anomalous @xmath6 dependence of the thermal resistance between the fluid and the cold source ( instead of the @xmath7 kapitza resistance ) @xcite . in this model",
    "the atoms ( carrying a spin ) can jump _ very quickly _ from one spin bath to the other ( i.e. the solid - like and the liquid ensemble ) .",
    "this generates in turn a spin current at the interface which carries information from one ensemble to the other , producing the signatures described above .",
    "+ in the present experimental work we visualize the fast exchange effect through the @xmath1 ( spin - spin relaxation time ) measured with cw - nmr on @xmath0he confined in aerogel . these original results are corollary to the @xmath5,@xmath1 measurements done on other substrates , but their importance lies in the quality of the data .",

    "in the present paper we report on continuous wave nuclear magnetic resonance experiments ( cw - nmr ) performed on @xmath0he confined in aerogel , for pressures ranging from 0 to 30 bars .",

    "the magnetic susceptibility of each spin component is @xmath52 .",
    "a static homogeneous magnetic field @xmath8 is imposed along @xmath53 .",
    "the two spin baths acquire thus a static ( homogeneous ) thermodynamical magnetization @xmath54 along @xmath53 .",
    "the radio - frequency ( magnetic ) excitation at angular frequency @xmath55 is denoted @xmath56 ( and points along @xmath57 ) .",
    "the total field is thus @xmath58 .",
    "the properties of both the solid and the liquid are homogeneous .",
    "moreover , the liquid and the solid are supposed to be perfectly isotropic .",
    "the superscripts @xmath59 evidently refer to the relevant spin bath .",
    "( color online ) schematic of the two idealized coupled spin baths ( not to scale ) .",
    "the global shape is taken to be isotropic for simplicity .",
    "the relevant parameters are introduced on the figure , and explained in the text . , height=188 ]    in this idealized view , they are two main simplifications which should not be impacting too much the description of the effect we are analysing .",
    "first , we wrote `` atomic layer '' in quotation marks because in practice it certainy _ is not _ a well defined crystalline solid .",
    "moreover , in a 2d solid the intra-``layer '' and inter-``layer '' spin transports are usually quite different . nevertheless , we rely on the disordered nature of the solid formed on the porous substrates to somehow `` smooth out '' these difficulties , by producing an average set of parameters roughly homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the second restriction is that we limit the discussion to one spherical cavity .",
    "again , its properties can be viewed as average parameters obtained over the distribution of pores in the material ( aerogel , sinter , powder ) . what this treatment neglects is any coherent phenomenon coming from the coupling between neigboring cavities",

    "this linewidth has a gaussian - like shape and can be quite broad . in the liquid phase however , due to the fast motion of the neighboring particles , the dipolar fields average out and the local field seen by one @xmath0he atom reduces almost to the static field @xmath8 : the nmr resonance line is very sharp , and this effect is known as _ motional narrowing _",

    "they write : @xmath63 by definition , at the boundary between liquid and solid we have : @xmath64 with the notation @xmath65 meaning `` on the internal side of the boundary spherical surface '' .",
    "this surface current will be discussed explicitly below",
    ".    one important result due to motional narrowing is that ( for low enough fields ) one simply has @xmath66 @xcite . in the degenerate fermi liquid ,",
    "only one parameter governs both the relaxation times and the spin diffusion coefficient @xmath62 : the quasi - particle scattering time @xmath67 .",
    "this single particle lifetime scales as @xmath68 typically below 50@xmath20mk @xcite .",
    "one has simply @xmath69 .",
    "+ the relaxation time gets much longer than a 100@xmath20s at low temperatures @xcite , and the diffusion coefficient has values far above @xmath70@xmath71/s @xcite ( this minimum occuring for both around 0.5@xmath20k ) .",
    "these values depend on pressure , and are the smallest at the melting curve .",
    "this means that on the scale of the solid linewidth , the liquid resonance line is almost a delta function , and the high value of the spin diffusion coefficient will ensure that magnetization is easily transported over the liquid sphere .",
    "+ due to the high - symmetry of the problem , each @xmath51 component of the magnetization depends only on @xmath72 .",
    "thus the derivation operators written above reduce to simple expressions , and @xmath73 is constant over the boundary surface .",
    "+ the above equations describe a trivial precession at @xmath55 of the magnetization about the field axis @xmath53 , plus the motion induced by the excitation @xmath74 .",
    "it is convenient to transpose them in a rotating frame , rotating at the precession velocity , in order to deal only with the slow dynamics induced by the nmr protocol : @xmath75 where the tilded parameters are rotating frame transformed parameters .",
    "we have introduced @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "taking the tabulated values and @xmath98 nm , one gets @xmath99 of the order of @xmath100 t .",
