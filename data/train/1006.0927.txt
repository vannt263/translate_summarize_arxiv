    "a more general perspective on the problem for a certain class of models is taken in refs .   and using methods of boundary critical phenomena and conformal field theory .",
    "the ultimate goal of the `` case studies '' is ( i ) to derive criteria which a priori allow to answer the question whether certain ( local ) observables become stationary and ( ii ) to construct the stationary density matrix @xmath6 , which is the appropriate ensemble by which the asymptotic expectation values can be computed .",
    "it is of particular interest to understand the conditions under which the latter becomes the canonical one and the system thermalizes . from our considerations it is plausible to expect that the number and character of the constants of motion of a specific model are of crucial importance in answering the questions addressed above . roughly speaking",
    ", if the number of constants of motion is large the time evolved state contains a lot of information from the initial state and thermalization can not be expected . in all the studies mentioned above single component systems containing either bosons or fermions were studied .",

    "in the area of photoexcited semiconductors much effort has been put into measuring ( pump - probe techniques ) and understanding the relaxation dynamics of highly excited electrons coupled to optical phonons ; for a recent review see ref .  .",
    "the long - time asymptotics of the electron - phonon system is difficult to study experimentally due to the strong coupling to other degrees of freedom ( e.g. acoustic phonons and holes ) , but the short - time ( transient ) dynamics shows interesting non - markovian effects requiring a treatment beyond the use of boltzmann equations.@xcite a detailed understanding of relaxation also plays a major role in the field of condensed matter system based quantum information processing.@xcite here the strong coupling of the degrees of freedom envisaged as quantum - bits to the environment usually leads to a coherence time to short to perform substantial information processing .",
    "gaining insights into the relaxation process might lead to ways to circumvent this obstacle and significantly increase the coherence time .",
    "we here supplement the recent `` case studies '' on the relaxation dynamics of either bosonic or fermionic correlated systems by analytically investigating the time evolution of a _ two - component _ model of electrons coupled to phonons .",
    "the model naturally contains two subsystems  the electron and the phonon systems  and an observable can be considered as _",
    "local _ if it contains only fermionic or bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "we first consider the time evolution resulting from a quench of the electron - phonon coupling from zero to a finite value starting with the noninteracting canonical equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 in the electron as well as the phonon subsystems . in _ addition _",
    "we study the dynamics inferred by the interacting hamiltonian out of a pure state given by the product of the phonon vacuum and the filled fermi sea supplemented by a highly excited additional electron of momentum @xmath52 .",
    "the _ short - time _ dynamics of our model starting with this initial state was earlier discussed in the context of optically excited semiconductors@xcite and used to explain results of pump - probe experiments.@xcite while the time evolution of observables , in particular the electron or phonon momentum distribution function and the subsystem energies , is rather simple for the quench a rich dynamics is found in case of the `` @xmath52-excitation '' .",
    "we show that in the large time limit @xmath1 the subsystem energies ( and the energy in the electron - phonon coupling ) converge to stationary values for both nonequilibrium initial states .",
    "the same holds for the electron momentum distribution , while for the phonon momentum distribution function convergence is only achieved after averaging over a small momentum interval .",

    "[ fig11 ] ) shows that the amplitude decays _",
    "faster _ than in the case of a quench , that is faster than @xmath206 .",
    "this has to be contrasted to the observation that it takes much _ longer _ times in case of the @xmath52-excitation before any asymptotic behavior sets in ( compare figs .  [ fig6 ] and [ fig11 ] ) . from the numerical data it turned out to be impossible to extract an analytical form of the amplitude decay ( e.g.  power law @xmath287 with an exponent @xmath288 larger than 1/2 ) .",
    "as already noted when discussing figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] the oscillation frequency of @xmath238 at fixed @xmath48 seems to dependent on @xmath48 .",
    "this becomes even more evident in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . besides this",
    "the oscillation frequency depends on the model parameters @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "we did not succeed in extracting a clear picture for the dependence of the frequencies on these three parameters .",
    "in addition , it is not obvious how to relate the numerically determined frequencies appearing in @xmath238 at fixed @xmath48 to the mode energies @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "this again exemplifies that the time evolution of the fermionic momentum distribution function for the @xmath52-excitation is rather involved and much richer than the dynamics encountered above .",
    "we studied the relaxation dynamics of an exactly solvable electron - phonon model out of two initial nonequilibrium states .",
    "this way we added a _ continuum _ model containing both _ fermions and bosons _ to the list of quantum many - body models recently investigated and considered other nonequilibrium situations than the parameter quench .",
    "our model features a natural set of constants of motion , with as many elements as degrees of freedom .",
    "this set can be used to construct the initial state dependent generalized gibbs ensemble .",
    "we found that for _ all observables _ of interest to us the asymptotic long - time limit of expectation values which _ become stationary _ are equal to those obtained from the appropriate _ natural gge .",
    "_ we discussed that the momentum distribution functions of the gge differ from those obtained within the canonical ensemble . while the ( excess ) energies and the electron",
    "momentum distribution function become stationary , the phonon momentum distribution at fixed momentum oscillates with a constant amplitude even at large times .",
    "this can be understood from the linear relation between the eigenmode ladder operators and the phononic ones .",
    "long - time convergence of the energies and the fermionic momentum distribution function in the strict sense is only achieved if the thermodynamic limit is taken first .",
    "going beyond this we showed that the gge predictions for these expectation values agree to time averaged values taken at large times ( even larger than the characteristic scale @xmath293 ) .",
    "for most of the studied situations we were able to _ analytically _ describe how the gge prediction is reached .",
    "we found that the asymptotic limit is only reached following a power law ( instead of exponentially ) .",
    "the dynamics of the fermionic momentum distribution function resulting from the @xmath52-excitation turned out to be much richer than the one found for other observables and for the interaction quench .",
