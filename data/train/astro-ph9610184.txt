    "the study of the history of stellar populations plays a crucial role in understanding the evolution of galaxies , and , in this framework , starbursts may occupy a key position . in a starburst galaxy ,",
    "the radiation output is dominated by the emission from a large number of recently formed , hot , massive stars . in some cases ,",
    "the rate of star formation is high enough that , if it remains constant , the galaxy will be depleted of its gas content in much less than a hubble time . the role of starbursts within the galaxy evolution scenario is still debated : are bursts of star formation the preferred channel for forming new stellar populations or are they just sporadic events in the lifetime of some galaxies ? did the first generation of stars in a primeval galaxy form from a widespread burst of star formation over a short timescale or was it created through a slow and mostly quiescent process ?    in order to answer these questions , we need first to understand how starbursts evolve in local galaxies .",
    "star formation episodes show a large variability in duration , ranging from 10@xmath310@xmath8  yr ( rieke et al . 1985 ) to more than 10@xmath5  yr ( hunter & gallagher 1986 ) .",
    "the lifespan of a star formation event is only loosely constrained by the gas depletion timescale .",
    "the mechanisms for generating inflows of gas to fuel the star forming region are not completely understood yet , although models are being investigated ( e.g. shlosman 1992 ) .",
    "the total gas mass in a galaxy is difficult to determine ,",
    "since both the atomic and molecular gas content need to be measured , but observational techniques to derive the molecular gas mass may be inadequate ( e.g. allen 1996 ) . the gas mass available for star formation may be increased by inputs from interacting companions .",
    "once triggered , the evolution of a starburst region depends on the details of its interaction with the galaxy environment .",
    "for instance , bursts of star formation can propagate across a galaxy , increasing the duration of the event ( e.g. , beck et al .",
    "high resolution imaging reveals that bursts of star formation break down into distinct knots of ob associations , often characterized by different evolutionary stages ( meurer et al .",
    "1995 , conti & vacca 1994 ) .",
    "finally , star formation processes can be depressed by gas outflows which may develop into superwinds and deplete a region of gas , and , therefore , of fuel ( heckman et al .",
    "1990 , de  young & heckman 1994 ) .",
    "it follows that feedback mechanisms from the host galaxy influence the evolution and the duration of a burst of star formation , and this is reflected into the stellar populations generated by the star - forming episode .",
    "the universality of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in starbursts is also an open issue .",
    "a dependence of the imf on environment may produce dramatically different results for the star formation history of the galaxy . increasing evidence suggests , however , that the slope of the imf in ob associations is fairly independent of the gas metallicity and close to the salpeter value ( @xmath6=2.35 ) in the high - mass  stars regime ( massey et al .",
    "1995 , moffat 1996 , stasinska & leitherer 1996 ) .",
    "the upper and lower mass limits for the imf in starburst galaxies are still strongly debated .",
    "stars as massive as 85100  m@xmath7 are found in the galaxy , in the magellanic clouds , and in nearby resolved starbursts , suggesting upper mass limits independent of the environment ( kudritzki et al .",
    "1991 , massey et al .",
    "1995 , moffat 1996 ) .",
    "infrared studies of unresolved starburst galaxies point , however , at upper mass limits as low as 30  m@xmath7 for the imf , using either the comparison of the observed spectra with models , as in the case of the luminous infrared galaxies ( goldader et al .",
    "1996 ) , or the analysis of the he / h line emission ratios ( doyon , puxley , & joseph 1992 , see however shields 1993 ) .",
    "even more difficult is the determination of the low  mass  star limit , which can not be directly observed , because the energy output from a starburst galaxy is dominated by the high  mass stars produced in the burst .",
    "values larger than 1  m@xmath7 for the low  mass limit of the imf in starburst galaxies have been suggested on the basis of the observed mass - to - light ratios ( rieke et al . 1980 , 1993 , bernlhr 1993 ) .",
    "these conclusions , however , depend on the adopted imf ( rieke et al .",
    "1993 ) and on the reddening correction applied to the luminosity .",
    "revisions of the latter indicate smaller values of the low  mass  star limit , at least for the famous case of m  82 ( lester et al .",
    "1990 , satyapal et al .",
    "the analysis of a relatively large sample of galaxies shows that a low - mass - star  deficient imf is , indeed , not universal among starbursts ( devereux 1989 ) .",
    "corrections for the effects of dust reddening are crucial when multiwavelength observations are used to derive intrinsic quantities for a galaxy .",
    "dust selectively extincts the radiation , with blue wavelengths being more affected than red wavelengths . as an added complication ,",
    "limitations in angular resolution usually produce observations of unresolved galactic regions , and the _ effective _ reddening of the emerging radiation is determined by the details of the dust - stars - gas geometry ( natta & panagia 1984 , disney , davies & phillips 1989 , witt , thronson & capuano 1992 , byun , freeman , & kylafis 1994 , giovanelli et al .",
    "1995 , xu & buat 1995 , shields & kennicutt 1995 , witt & gordon 1996 , boisse & thoraval 1996 ) .",
    "dust obscuration in moderately reddened starburst galaxies can be well represented by a ( clumpy ) dust distribution foreground to the star forming region(s ) ( calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 , 1996 , kinney et al .",
    "1994 , calzetti et al .",
    "1995 , meurer et al .",
    "however , the reddening of the stellar continuum in these galaxies is generally lower than the reddening of the ionized gas ( e.g. fanelli , oconnell & thuan 1988 , calzetti et al .",
    "1994 , cks94 hereafter , lanon , rocca - volmerange & thuan 1996 , mayya & prabhu 1996 ) , suggesting that the covering factor of the dust in front of the stars is lower than that in front of the gas .",
    "generally , the effects of the dust obscuration are only partially explained by the foreground distribution .",
    "the observed uv and optical radiation accounts only for 70% of all the radiation contributing to the far  infrared ( iras ) luminosity ( calzetti et al . 1995 ) , implying that a fraction of the stars is embedded in optically thick dust clouds .",
    "the study of the star formation histories of starburst galaxies helps to gain insight into the starburst phenomenon . new photometric data at j , h , and k are presented and discussed for a sample of 24 galaxies , and are supplemented with published uv , optical and near infrared spectra .",
    "these data are used to investigate the reddening properties of the stellar continuum in the entire wavelength range uv - to - ir , and to derive the stellar content of starburst regions .",
    "the investigation on the dust obscuration of the stellar continuum presented here ( section  4 ) is an extension to infrared wavelengths of the study of cks94 ; the results on the reddening of the ionized gas of calzetti et al .",
    "( 1996 , cks96 hereafter ) will be used .",
    "the observations are presented in sections  2 and 3 .",
    "constraints on the recent star formation history through the type ii supernova rates are derived in section  5 , and the stellar content and star formation history of the galaxies are discussed in sections  6 and 7 .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section  8 .",
    "the 24 galaxies listed in table  1 include 19 starbursts , 1 liner , and 4 seyfert  2s , selected from the _ atlas of ultraviolet spectra of star - forming galaxies _ of kinney et al .",
    "a galaxy had to have a well detected uv spectrum in the iue archive in order to be included in the sample , which automatically excluded heavily reddened objects .",
    "in addition to this basic selection criterion , optical spectra obtained in apertures which closely match that of iue had to be available ( see section  2.3 ) . for this sample ,",
    "broad - band images at j , h , and k , and , for some of the galaxies , infrared ( ir ) spectra were obtained ( see cks96 for the ir spectroscopy ) .",
    "the 24 galaxies are at low redshifts , with distances between 2.5  mpc ( ngc  1569 ) and 300  mpc ( mrk  357 ) , with median value @xmath160  mpc ( h@xmath9=50  km / s / mpc ) .",
    "the multiwavelength data are obtained using observational apertures which are closely matched in size , so that the same region is sampled at all wavelengths in each galaxy .",
    "the apertures subtend physical regions of about 4.5  kpc at the typical distance of the galaxies , implying that a fairly large portion of the galaxy population is sampled .",
    "the 19 starburst galaxies span a range of morphological types , from sab to irregulars , usually with disturbed morphologies .",
    "the oxygen abundance ranges typically from 1/4 to twice solar ( see table  2 ) , although abundances as low as 1/10 solar have been derived for ngc  4861 ( barth et al .",
    "a detailed description of the data used in this work is given in the following two sections .",
    "the ir images were obtained with the simultaneous quad - color infrared imaging device ( sqiid ) at the kpno 1.3-m telescope during two separate runs in april 1994 and october 1994 .",
    "the sqiid has four detectors which are exposed simultaneously to image a field in the j , h , k , and l bands .",
    "each detector has 256@xmath2256 pixels , with a scale of 1.395@xmath10/pix , 1.366@xmath10/pix , and 1.361@xmath10/pix at j , h , and k , respectively .",
    "the overlapping area between the detectors is 245@xmath2245 pixels ( ellis et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the targets were typically observed with multiple exposures of 3 minutes each , to account for the fluctuations of the sky background .",
    "total integration times ranged from 15 minutes for the brightest galaxies to 36 minutes for the faintest galaxies .",
    "ngc  1068 was observed with multiple exposures of 5 seconds each , with total integration time of 30 seconds .",
    "sky frames were obtained by moving the targets across the sqiid 5.5@xmath11 field of view .    the data were background subtracted using dimsum , which masks the objects and rescales the images before median filtering to create the sky frames .",
    "flat - fielding and co - addition of the images was obtained using the sqiid data reduction package .",
    "at least one blue ( j@xmath12k@xmath40.1 ) and one red ( j@xmath12k@xmath10.9 ) standard stars from the list of elias et al .",
    "( 1982 ) were observed each night for flux calibration and color corrections .",
    "the blue standards were followed through the night to provide airmass corrections .",
    "the loss in flux due to a unit change in airmass is 0.175 mag at j and k , and 0.125 mag at h.    cross - calibration of the standard stars shows variations of about 6% in the absolute k band photometry during the april run and 7% in the same band during the september run .",
    "the uncertainties are smaller in the more sensitive j and h bands .",
    "the variations of the observed colors relative to the expected ones for the standard stars are @xmath13% and @xmath14% during the april run , and @xmath15% and @xmath16% during the september run .",
    "the variations are small , likely because of the simultaneous exposure of the j , h , and k detectors .",
    "the observed galaxies are listed in table  1 , together with the activity type , the redshift , the k - band magnitude , the j@xmath12h color , and the h@xmath12k color , measured in an aperture of 10@xmath10 diameter centered on the starburst .",
    "all quantities have been corrected for the foreground extinction from our galaxy ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) .",
    "the present sample has some overlap with the sample of markarian galaxies analyzed by balzano & weedman ( 1981 ) , who obtained absolute photometry at j , h , and k in an aperture comparable to the one used here .",
    "the 7 galaxies in common between the two samples are : ic  1586 ( mrk  347 ) , ngc  1614 ( mrk  617 ) , ngc  4194 ( mrk  201 ) , ngc  4385 ( mrk  52 ) , ngc  6052 ( mrk297 ) , ngc  6217 , ngc  7714 ( mrk  538 ) . differences @xmath17 and @xmath18 are observed in the absolute photometry of the common galaxies ; typical differences in the colors are less than @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt the differences as 1  @xmath21 uncertainties on our measurements .",
    "the differences with previous results are larger for the absolute photometry than for the colors , and can be attributed to the different filter bandpasses used in the two works , to the different calibration stars , and to atmospheric transparency variations during our observations .",

    ", therefore , carries uncertainties due to the unknown behaviour of the galaxies energy distribution in the wavelength range not covered by the spectra .",
    "this , coupled with the fact that variations of the atmospheric transparency were larger during the imaging observations than during the spectroscopic observations , may ultimately account for the mismatch .",
    "the nir spectral index derived from the spectra , @xmath30 must have the same value of the index from the images , @xmath25 , if the relative calibration of different wavebands has been done correctly .",

    "an uncertainty of less than 30% in the calibration of the j spectra relative to the k spectra produces a variation @xmath34 . in the next sections ,",
    "the nir colors associated with the two galaxies will be those from the imaging , since the j , h , and k images were obtained simultaneously , and are thus almost independent of the sky conditions .",
    "the starburst , liner , and sy2 galaxies in our sample occupy the typical loci expected for these classes of galaxies in the ( j@xmath12h)(h@xmath12k ) diagram ( see figure  4 ; e.g. carico et al . 1986 ) . only ngc  4861 and ngc  1068 deviate from the general trend .",
    "the j@xmath12h color of ngc  4861 is bluer than the other starbursts and is due to the pa@xmath23 emission line s contribution to the j - band magnitude ( table  3 ) .",

    "1990 ) , then the hot dust provides about 50% of the flux at 2.2  @xmath0 m .",
    "the properties of the starburst galaxies in the sample can not be properly discussed without investigating the impact of the dust obscuration on the measured fluxes .",
    "the analysis of the dust reddening in external galaxies is usually complicated by the potentially complex geometries which characterize the distribution of stars , ionized gas , and dust . even in the presence of fairly large amounts of dust , mixed distributions of the various components",
    "can mimick a grey obscuration , and give the ( incorrect ) impression that the reddening in the galaxy is negligible ( e.g. , witt , thronson , & capuano 1992 ) .",
    "in addition , the obscuration suffered by the stellar continuum may be different from the obscuration of the ionized gas , since stars and gas may occupy different locations within the galaxy , and the dust may have different covering factors for stars and gas .",
    "various authors ( e.g. , fanelli et al .",
    "1988 , cks94 , lanon et al .",
    "1996 ) have reported that the emission from stars is typically less obscured than the emission from the ionized gas .",
    "however , cks94 showed that the reddening of the uv continuum emission ( i.e. , massive stars ) correlates with the reddening of the gas . in this and the next section we use the infrared observations presented in section  2 to pin down the effects of obscuration on the stellar continuum of the sample galaxies , and to derive a description for the geometrical distribution of the dust .",
    "for the reddening of the nebular gas , the results by cks96 are adopted .    from the analysis of the hydrogen emission line intensities at optical and infrared wavelengths , cks96",
    "conclude that the geometry of the dust obscuring the ionized gas can be described by a foreground clumpy distribution , and the reddening is compatible with a galactic - like extinction curve .",
    "although the solution for the geometry is not unique ( see puxley & brand for the case of ngc1614 ) , it represents a simple description which accounts for the observed reddening values of the gas in the optical@xmath35ir wavelength range ( up to br@xmath27 ) .",
    "the same study excludes pure internal dust as a viable geometrical description .",
    "the dust obscuration becomes progressively less important towards ir wavelengths ; the galactic extinction is about 10 times smaller at 2.2  @xmath0 m than at 0.55  @xmath0 m .",
    "the effects of dust reddening on the stellar continuum can then be investigated using multiwavelength observations .",

    "the linear correlation between the stellar continuum flux ratios and the color excess of the ionized gas indicates that the reddening of the gas is proportional that of the stars ( cks94 ) .",

    "the lower number of data available from spectroscopy is usually compensated by tighter correlations , resulting in smaller values of the reduced @xmath32 and in comparable 1  @xmath21 uncertainties in the two data sets .",
    "the galaxies ngc  4861 and ic  214 do not follow the same trend as the others at uv and optical wavelengths , respectively , and are removed from the fits .",
    "ngc  4861 is in any respect a peculiar galaxy in our sample ; the large ews of its emission lines suggest an overall stellar population which is much younger than the average of the other galaxies in the sample . both the continuum and the line emission from ngc  4861 are dominated by the bright knot , a giant hii region with an upper limit on the age of @xmath14.5  myr ( barth et al .",
    "1994 , see also section  7 ) . for ic  214 ,",
    "the deviation can be attributed to the absolute calibration of the optical spectrum , which appears underestimated .",
    "there are only 8 galaxies in our sample for which f(0.26 ) is available , therefore the data point k@xmath11(0.26)-k@xmath11(k ) has the largest uncertainty .",
    "the values of k@xmath11(@xmath44 ) are shown in figure  6 , together with the curve obtained by cks94 at uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "cks94 could not derive the absolute value for the obscuration curve , and their curve is here arbitrarily placed at k@xmath11(0.55)-k@xmath11(2.2)=2 , which is approximately the halfway point between the two sets of values obtained from e(b@xmath12v)@xmath50 and from e(b@xmath12v)@xmath51 ( see table  5 ) .",
    "the k@xmath11(@xmath44 ) values derived from the e(b@xmath12)@xmath51 correlations are systematically higher than the values derived from the e(b@xmath12)@xmath50 correlations .",

    "the differences in k@xmath11(@xmath44)-k@xmath11(2.2 ) can therefore be attributed to the statistical uncertainty associated with the small number of points on which the linear fits are performed .",
    "hence , we adopt the dispersion of the two datasets as the actual uncertainty in our measurements .    for the galactic diffuse interstellar medium , the total - to - selective extinction at optical wavelengths is k(0.55)=3.1 , and the selective extinction is k(0.55)@xmath12k(2.2)=2.8 .",
    "the mean value of k@xmath11(0.55)@xmath12k@xmath11(2.2 ) is @xmath53 for the obscuration curve of figure  6 , smaller than the galactic value .",
    "the present data are not suited for deriving the total - to - selective obscuration at optical wavelengths k@xmath11(0.55 ) , because we are lacking the reference point at zero obscuration ( e.g. radio data ) . however , since the total - to - selective obscuration at k , k@xmath11(2.2 ) , is expected to be small , and probably not larger than the corresponding galactic value k(2.2)=0.3 , k@xmath11(0.55 ) should be only a few tenths larger than k@xmath11(0.55)@xmath12k@xmath11(2.2 ) .",
    "it follows that the total - to - selective obscuration in the starburst galaxies is smaller than the total - to - selective galactic extinction .",
    "this method normalizes the obscuration curve to the color excess of the nebular gas [ equation ( 4 ) ] ; as will be seen in the next section , the shallow trend of k@xmath11(@xmath44 ) , expecially at uv wavelengths , can be interpreted as a difference in the covering factors of the dust in front of the stars and of the gas .",
    "emission from hot dust may in principle originate around hii regions , where the high uv energy density may heat a fraction of the available dust to high temperatures ( t@xmath54  k , e.g. panagia 1978 ) , and contribute to the k - band flux .",
    "a contribution to the k - band proportional to the amount of reddening from the hot dust would bias the slope @xmath55 of equation  2 by increasing its absolute value , and making it more negative .",
    "however , the k - band flux of the `` dusty '' starburst galaxy m  82 receives less than 15% contribution from hot dust ( satyapal et al .",
    "in addition , bluer wavelengths are progressively less affected by hot dust emission than the k  band , and our results on k@xmath11(@xmath44 ) do not change if the j  band instead of the k  band is chosen as reference point .",
    "two basic hypotheses are used in deriving k@xmath11(@xmath44 ) : 1 ) the stellar continuum ratios f(@xmath36)/f(k ) are mostly determined by dust reddening and the variations in the composition of the stellar population in each galaxy are a secondary effect ; 2 ) the ageing of the burst population is also a secondary effect . to test these hypotheses , the observed continuum ratios f(0.55)/f(0.16 ) and f(2.2)/f(0.55 ) of the 19 galaxies",
    "are compared with predictions from models of stellar populations in figure  7 .",
    "the two extreme cases of a single , ageing burst population and of a continuous star formation population , in the age range 1@xmath210@xmath31.5@xmath210@xmath56  yr , are considered ( bruzual & charlot 1996 , leitherer & heckman 1995 , lh95 hereafter , see also section  6 ) . in neither case , the predicted colors are able to reproduce the observed ones .",
    "the reddening lines are also shown , using the galactic and lmc extinction curves and the curve of figure  6 .",
    "the trend of the data points is compatible with being mostly due to dust obscuration , and the scatter around the reddening line can be attributed to variations in the intrinsic populations from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "some scatter is indeed expected due to the large galaxy region subtended by the observational apertures .",
    "the separate position occupied by ngc  4861 in the diagram is a consequence of the younger stellar population which characterize this galaxy relative to the others ( see section  7 ) .",
    "the location of ic  214 is explained by the inaccurate calibration at optical wavelengths .",
    "further evidence that the reddening and not the ageing of the burst population is the main responsible for the observed trends comes from the study reported in cks94 . in starburst galaxies , the uv spectral index is weakly dependent on age ; the number of ionizing photons decreases significantly ( and the nebular lines becomes undetectable ) before the intrinsic value of the uv spectral index changes appreciably ( lh95 ) .",
    "therefore , the correlation of the uv spectral index with the color excess e(b@xmath12v ) of the gas , found by cks94 , is an effect of dust reddening ; the ultraviolet stellar continuum becomes redder as the reddening of the gas increases .",
    "the distribution of stars , gas , and dust in galaxies is complex enough that in general it can not be fully accounted for by simple models .",
    "however , models provide pictorial guidelines on the true distribution , and , in some cases , can satisfactorily describe the observables , such as the reddening of the emerging radiation .    the foreground clumpy dust model , which is able to describe the reddening of the nebular gas ( cks96 ) ,",
    "will be employed to pin down any difference between the obscuration of the stellar continuum and the obscuration of the gas , from the uv to the k band . in the model ,",
    "the dust clumps are assumed to be all equal and to be poissonian distributed along the line of sight , with average number @xmath57 ( natta & panagia 1984 , cks94 ) .",
    "the clumpy distribution is also assumed to be foreground to the ionized gas , and , therefore , to the starburst region ; however , it is not required that it is foreground to the entire galaxy .",
    "it should be remembered that the goal of the model is to provide some insight on the systematic behavior of the reddening suffered by the stars , but may not necessarily yield the _ exact _ geometrical distribution of the dust in the galaxy .",
    "the general expression for the color excess of the radiation crossing a foreground distribution of clumps is given by ( cks94 ) : @xmath58 where h@xmath39 and h@xmath40 are defined as in equation  ( 1 ) , @xmath59 is the average number of clumps crossed by the nebular radiation , @xmath60 is the optical depth of a clump at wavelength @xmath44 , which satisfies the relation @xmath61 , and k(@xmath44 ) is the extinction curve ( e.g. , galactic or lmc ) .",
    "two cases are shown in figure  8 , overplotted to the data of cks96 , and correspond to two configurations of the relative source - dust location .",
    "in the first case ( dashed line in figure  8) , the dust layer is close to the radiation source , so light from regions outside the observational aperture is scattered into the line of sight , and adds a positive contribution to the observed radiation ( scattering model , this is also the case shown in figure  1 of cks96 ) . in the second case ( continuous line ) , such `` extra '' contribution is not present , because the clumpy dust layer is distant from the radiation source , or because the observational aperture is large enough to encompass most of the scattering regions ( non - scattering model ) .",
    "the non - scattering model is in better agreement with the observed color excess than the scattering model , and is used to investigate the behavior of the stellar continuum .",
    "the agreement with the data of the non - scattering case is not surprising , since the observational aperture encompasses a major fraction of the galaxy at the typical distance of 60  mpc .",
    "since the reddening of the stellar continuum correlates with the reddening of the nebular gas , the same model can be employed to describe the obscuration of gas and stars . however , the possibility that the covering factor of the dust changes from gas to stars should be included . for a foreground distribution of clumps , the selective obscuration of the stellar continuum relative to the emission lines , k@xmath11(@xmath44)@xmath12k@xmath11(2.2 ) , is then given by ( cks94 ) : @xmath62}\\over \\displaystyle [ e^{-\\tau_c(h_b ) } -   e^{-\\tau_c(h_a)}]}\\ [ k(h_a)-k(h_b)],\\eqno(6)\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the ratio of the average number of clumps in front of the stars to the number in front of the ionized gas ( i.e. , the ratio between covering factors ) .",
    "the shape of the curve in equation  ( 6 ) depends on the optical depth of the clumps , and on the two emission lines h@xmath39 and h@xmath40 selected for the normalization ; however , for our range of optical depths , @xmath64 or , if @xmath65 , e(b@xmath12v)@xmath661 , such dependences are not important .    the effect of the parameter @xmath67 on the selective obscuration described by equation  ( 6 ) is shown in figure  9 .",
    "if both the ionized gas and the stars cross the same dust layer , @xmath68 ; the case shown in the figure ( curves 1 g and 1l ) corresponds to @xmath59=10 and e(b@xmath12v)@xmath51=1.0 , which implies @xmath69 .",
    "the predicted optical and uv rise is clearly steeper than the observed one , and the disagreement is not lessened if the model parameters are changed : the dependence on @xmath70 is weak for our range of values , and there is no explicit dependence of the curve on the average amount of clumps @xmath57 .",
    "however , changing the value of @xmath67 changes the normalization of the obscuration curve . a qualitative agreement between data and models",
    "is observed in figure  9 , for both the galactic and the lmc extinction curves , if @xmath71 is adopted ( curves 2 g , 2l , 3 g , and 3l ) . from a quantitative point of view , small disagreements still exist between data and models : the galactic curve has in general too strong a 0.22  @xmath0 m feature , and the lmc curve is too steep in the far - uv , relative to the cks94 curve .",
    "these deviations are accentuated for small values of @xmath72 , although in such regime the reddening effect of the dust on the emerging radiation is small , and the details of the selective obscuration are lost in the measurement uncertainties .",
    "physically , @xmath73 means that the stellar continuum radiation crosses only 60% of the clumps crossed by the nebular radiation before emerging from the galaxy .",
    "the covering factor of the dust in front of the gas is then almost twice as much as the covering factor of the dust in front of the stars .",
    "the dust distribution is not only clumpy , but is also unevenly distributed in front of stars and gas , and the ionized gas is , on average , more closely associated with the dust than the stars are ( cf . cks94 ; see , however , keel 1993 ) .",
    "these results on the reddening of the stellar continuum in starbursts will be applied in sections 6 and 7 to derive the intrinsic shape of the spectra .",
    "a first constraint on the star formation histories of our galaxies can be obtained from the comparison of the present supernova rate , which is a measure of the past star formation activity , with the present rate of production of ionizing photons , which is a measure of the current star formation activity ( kennicutt 1983 ) .",

    "the [ feii ] emission from a galaxy may be thought of as a measure of the `` current '' supernova rate ( greenhouse et al .",

    "1989 ) . the nebular h emission can be used to derive a `` predicted '' type ii supernova rate , because it gives a measure of the number of massive stars which are presently ionizing the gas .",
    "the total number of type ii supernovae ( snii ) produced by an instantaneous burst of star formation is at most a factor 2 lower than the total number of type ia supernovae ( snia ) , but is spread over timescale about 30 times shorter ( greggio 1996 ) .",
    "it follows that in a steady star formation regime , the snii rate is about one order of magnitude larger than the snia rate , as observed for late type spirals ( van den bergh & tamman 1991 ) . in this case , the [ feii ] emission is produced mainly by shocks from snii ( and from snib , if these arise from massive stars , see ratnatunga & van den bergh 1989 ) , and is a measure of star formation activity in the recent past .",
    "the tight correlation between [ feii ] and the h recombination lines for the starburst galaxies in this sample ( with the exception of ngc  4861 and ngc  1569 , see below ) suggests that the current supernova rate yields numbers which are proportional to the predicted supernova rate .",
    "the galaxies are characterized by similar values of the oxygen abundance ( cks94 ) , therefore metallicity effects should not be important here . in an instantaneous burst of star formation , the number of ionizing photons decreases by 2 orders of magnitude after 78  myr , while the first type ii supernova appears after 35  myr ( lh95 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that all the galaxies in this sample are in the narrow evolutionary window between 4 and 8 myr , and we favor continuous star formation to explain the tight correlation of figure  12 .",

    "meurer et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the star formation histories of individual knots are averaged into a `` global '' star formation event .",

    "a direct comparison with the broad band data shows that the two sets of data are consistent with each other , and describe the same mean spectrum .",
    "because of their resolution , the spectra from cks94 provide detailed information on the far uv rise and the amplitude of the @xmath10.4  @xmath0 m discontinuity , which may help constrain the stellar populations responsible for the observed radiation .",
    "the tss is shown in figure  13 .",
    "the spectral synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 1996 , bc96 hereafter ) are used to generate spectra for the fit of the tss .",
    "the adopted imf is salpeter in the mass range 0.1100  m@xmath7 .",
    "the bc96 models do not include the contribution from the nebular continuum emission , which we obtain from lh95 and add to the spectra produced by the bc96 code at the appropriate age .",
    "the bc96 models are given for solar metallicity only ; this is sufficiently adequate for the present sample , where most of the galaxies have about solar metallicity .",
    "the synthetic spectrum to be compared with the tss is built by combining three stellar populations of increasing age .",
    "the weights of the three populations are left as free parameters which are fitted via the minimum @xmath32 technique .",
    "the best fit model must also satisfy the additional constrain of being able to reproduce the observed hydrogen line ews .",
    "of the three stellar populations , one is assumed to be young and responsible for most of the ultraviolet continuum ( `` star - forming population '' ) ; the other two are assumed to be older than the first and contribute mainly to the optical and ir continuum , to dilute the hydrogen line ews ( `` underlying populations '' ) .",
    "for this reason , the star - forming population is selected in the age range 03@xmath210@xmath3  yr , and both the cases of an instantaneous burst of star formation and of a constant sfr regime are considered .",
    "the underlying populations have ages @xmath957@xmath210@xmath3  yr , and are produced by bursts of star formation .",
    "the latter is not a restrictive assumption if the the burst duration is finite , but much shorter than the age of the stars . a second type of fit of the tss is also attempted by using only one star - forming population with constant sfr , and leaving the age as free parameter .",
    "the spectrum produced by a star - forming population alone has systematically bluer colors than the tss at uv wavelengths , for a stellar age of less than a few 10@xmath3  yr .",
    "figure  13a shows the example of a stellar population with constant sfr and 2@xmath210@xmath3  yr old .",
    "this spectrum is clearly bluer than the tss at all wavelengths . among the instantaneous - burst populations , the one which comes closer to the tss has an age of 10  myr , still a much bluer uv spectrum , and far too red optical@xmath12ir colors .",
    "the tss therefore appears to receive additional contribution from stellar populations which are older than a few times 10@xmath3  yr . a starburst galaxy may indeed be conceived as a high  sfr event superimposed to an underlying quiescent galaxy , which is probably forming stars at a roughly constant ( and small ) rate since a hubble time . in figure  13b",
    ", this galaxy is modelled by the combination of two stellar populations : the first is undergoing star formation at a constant rate since 1.5@xmath210@xmath56  yr and represents the underlying galaxy population ; the second is undergoing star formation at a constant rate since 2@xmath210@xmath3  yr and represents the starburst population .",
    "the fit of this model to the tss is quite unsatisfactory , expecially at optical wavelengths , where the model spectrum tends to be redder than the tss .",
    "this is a common characteristics to all the synthetic spectra obtained by combining a relatively young population ( age @xmath110@xmath3  yr or younger ) with an old underlying population ( age @xmath110@xmath56  yr ) .",
    "a satisfactory fit of the tss can be obtained with a stellar population characterized by constant sfr since 12@xmath210@xmath5  yr ( see figure  13c ) .",
    "the low mass stars produced during this period of time , and which contribute mostly to the optical and ir flux , account approximately for the dilution of the ews of the hydrogen emission lines , although a detailed comparison would imply an heavy extrapolation from the lh95 diagrams",
    ". the hi gas reservoir of our galaxies may be sufficient to support such long star formation timescales at the present sfr ( columns 2 and 4 of table  8) .",
    "for mrk  357 , ngc  1614 , ngc  4194 , ngc  4385 , ngc  6090 , and mrk  309 , whose gas depletion timescale is shorter than 10@xmath5  yr , the present burst of star formation is probably an exceptional event .",
    "however , molecular hydrogen has not been included in the gas supply estimates of table  8 , and , if present in large amounts , would considerably increase the depletion times . rather than a single large star formation event lasting 10@xmath5  yr , the starburst region subtended by our large aperture may be thought of as a collection of more modest bursting knots characterized by different values of the sfr and igniting at different epochs of the galaxy s life .",
    "a way to reduce the sfr and allow the burst to last longer with the available gas supply is to assume that low  mass stars are not produced during bursts of star formation , or , alternatively , that the imf is flatter than salpeter below a certain stellar mass ; if the low mass limit for the imf is 1  m@xmath7 , instead of 0.1  m@xmath7 , the sfrs decrease by a factor @xmath12.5 , for @xmath6=2.35 . whether this is the case in starburst galaxies",
    "is still debated ( e.g. , rieke et al .",
    "1980 , 1993 , lester et al .",
    "1990 , satyapal et al .",
    "1995 , bernlr 1993 ; see also below ) .    a better fit to the data in terms of @xmath32 is given by the combination of three components : a 2@xmath210@xmath3  yr population with constant sfr , and two intermediate age populations , generated by instantaneous bursts 10@xmath8  yr and 5@xmath210@xmath8  yr ago , respectively .",
    "they contribute 15% , 13% , and 72% , respectively , of the k - band flux ( see figure  13d ) .",
    "the intermediate age populations are responsible for the dilution of the ews of the hydrogen emission lines , and account for the small values of the observed h@xmath6 , pa@xmath23 , and br@xmath27 ews ( see table  7 ) .",
    "an additional consistency check is to compare the k - band luminosities of the galaxies with the model .",
    "column  7 of table  8 gives for each galaxy the reddening corrected k - band luminosity , l@xmath96 , in units of the solar k - band luminosity , and normalized to the star formation rate sfr100 ; these values are to be compared with the quantity 5.28@xmath210@xmath5  l@xmath7  yr / m@xmath7 derived for the model .",
    "most of the galaxies lay within a factor two of the model value , and the median value for the observed l@xmath96/sfr100 is 5.94@xmath210@xmath5  l@xmath7  yr / m@xmath7 . the exceptions are ngc  4861 and ngc  6217 .",
    "as will be seen in a following section , the k - band flux of ngc  4861 receives about 50% contribution from the bursting population ; in the case of ngc  6217 , it is likely that old stellar populations provide the bulk of the k - band flux .",
    "the mass in stars per unit of sfr predicted by the model is 1.62@xmath210@xmath5  m@xmath7 .",
    "this value is also the timescale over which the stars have been produced , namely 1.62@xmath210@xmath5  yr , if the sfr remained constant over that period of time ; this is in rough agreement with the age of the oldest stellar population from the model ( @xmath97500  myr ) .",
    "if the star formation is episodic , some of the past episodes may have been characterized by different ( possibly higher ) values of the sfr , and the entire star - forming event by a different ( possibly shorter ) timescale .",
    "the amplitude of the discontinuity at 0.4  @xmath0 m in the synthetic model is overpredicted relative to the observations ; this characteristic remains true also when model fitting of individual galaxies is attempted ( see below ) , and may be partially explained by the fact that the wavelength region 0.320.38  @xmath0 m is the noisiest in our spectra ( cf .",
    "mcquade et al .",
    "1995 , storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "as already discussed above , underlying populations older than 12  gyr produce increasingly worse fits of the tss , mainly because the synthetic spectra are far too red at optical wavelengths ; the underlying stellar population contributing to the mean starburst spectrum must thus be younger than @xmath972  gyr . changing the metallicity of the model populations from solar to half",
    "solar ( the typical value of our galaxies ) has a negligible effect on this conclusion .",
    "the small values of the hydrogen line ews can be explained either as a dilution effect from an underlying population or as evidence for a high - mass - star  truncated imf .",
    "a 30  m@xmath7 upper mass limit produces a factor 45 less ionizing photons than a 100  m@xmath7 upper mass limit , for a salpeter imf ( lh95 ) , and therefore , smaller emission line ews .",
    "for instance , a @xmath15@xmath210@xmath3  yr star - forming population , with constant sfr and a 0.130  m@xmath7 salpeter imf , accounts for the observed mean ews of table  7 .",
    "however , its spectrum does not reproduce other observables ; it is , for instance , much bluer than the tss ( figure  14 ) .",
    "a fit of both the tss and the line ews with a high - mass  truncated imf still requires the presence of intermediate age underlying populations . in this case",
    ", the best fitting star - forming population has age 0.51@xmath210@xmath3  yr , which is when red supergiants appear ; a small change in age thus corresponds to a variation up to a factor 20 in the ew of the infrared hydrogen lines ( lh95 ) .",
    "this is in contradiction with the observational values of the br@xmath27 ew , which show a small spread around the mean value .",
    "the model predicts a k - band luminosity per unit of sfr30 @xmath13.0@xmath210@xmath5  l@xmath7  yr / m@xmath7 , which is a factor @xmath12 larger than the observed mean value l@xmath96/sfr30@xmath931.4@xmath210@xmath5",
    "l@xmath7  yr / m@xmath7 .",
    "this prediction is minimally dependent on the age of the star - forming population , since the intermediate age populations contribute more than 80% of the k - band flux , even when the red supergiants appear .",
    "the gas consumption timescales decrease by a factor 4.35 , going from m@xmath98=100  m@xmath7 ( cf .",
    "table  8) to m@xmath98=30  m@xmath7 ; for most of the galaxies in the sample the hi gas depletion time is , then , less than the age of the older population predicted by the model .",
    "there is , in conclusion , no compelling evidence for a high - mass - star  truncated imf from this set of data ( see , also , moffat 1996 ) .    in summary",
    ", the tss can be described either by a single star - forming population which is undergoing constant star formation since 12@xmath210@xmath5  yr , or by the combination of a relatively young ( @xmath12@xmath210@xmath3  yr ) , constant sfr population with two older underlying populations , in the age range 10@xmath810@xmath5  yr and no longer forming stars . the fitting technique is not sophisticated enough to break the two intermediate age populations into more components .",
    "it is interesting , however , that at least two intermediate age components , and maybe a continuously star - forming population , are needed to fit the observed spectrum ; this support the idea that starburst activity in galaxies is spread over a timescale of roughly 10@xmath5  yr and proceeds through episodes which may involve different but spatially close regions ( e.g. waller 1991 ) .",
    "stellar populations older than @xmath110@xmath5  yr are not needed to account for the tss , implying that the emission from the most recently formed stars dominates the observed spectrum not only in the uv , but also at optical and ir wavelengths .",
    "this explains , a posteriori , why the continuum emission from the galaxies follows a common reddening trend at all wavelengths , as seen in section  4.1 .",
    "the best fit model to the tss yields a stellar mass - to - light ratio , m / l@xmath96 , of 0.31  m@xmath7/l@xmath99 , where l@xmath96 is the k - band luminosity ; 98.7% of the mass in this ratio is provided by the two intermediate age populations . the mean value of the observed mass - to - light ratio is 1.44  m@xmath7/l@xmath99 ( see the last column of table  8) , or about 5 times the stellar mass - to - light ratio predicted from the model .",
    "each galaxy s mass - to - light ratio has been derived from the dynamical mass , m@xmath100 , subtended by the observational aperture , using the hi velocity width from huchtmeier & richter ( 1989 ) .",
    "the difference between the observed and the model mass - to - light ratios allows room for the presence of molecular and atomic gas , of stellar remnants and of low  mass  stars ( older than @xmath12@xmath210@xmath5  yr ) which contribute negligibly to the observed luminosity , but will contribute to the mass .",
    "an estimate of the hi mass contained within the observational aperture is given in column  6 of table  8 , and is in general a small fraction of the total mass within the aperture ; the values of column  6 are derived assuming a spherical distribution for the hi gas . to estimate the contribution to the dynamical mass of the stars older than @xmath12@xmath210@xmath5  yr , we assume that the stellar populations follow a hubble luminosity profile ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . for a galaxy with typical stellar mass 10@xmath101  m@xmath7 and radius 10  kpc ,",
    "the mass contained within a region of 4  kpc in diameter is about 3.6@xmath210@xmath56  m@xmath7 .",
    "this value is a factor 4 smaller if the galaxy follows an exponential profile .",
    "if the age of the stars is 10  gyr or larger , the k - band luminosity produced by this low - mass  star population is less than 15% of the observed mean value , and of the same order of magnitude of the observational uncertainties .",
    "the total mass produced by a star formation event lasting 2@xmath210@xmath5  yr and with mean sfr100=9  m@xmath7/yr ( as derived from table  6 ) is 1.8@xmath210@xmath56  m@xmath7 , or about 1/2 of the pre - existing stars .",
    "accounting for the mass returned to the ism by supernova explosions would introduce a small difference in this estimate , because most of the mass is locked in low  mass stars .",
    "the total stellar mass - to - light ratio is therefore 3 times larger than the mass - to - light ratio of the population generated by the star formation event , namely @xmath10.9  m@xmath7/l@xmath99 . only ngc  1614 , ngc  4194 , and ngc",
    "4385 have mass - to - light ratios significantly smaller than 0.9  m@xmath7/l@xmath99 .",
    "a few reasons may explain their case : 1 ) the tss does not match perfectly each individual spectral energy distribution , and specific stellar population models should be applied to individual galaxies ; 2 ) the dynamical mass may be underestimated , because detailed density profiles have not been taken into account .    in summary ,",
    "the mean mass - to - light ratio derived from the observations is compatible with the value derived from the model .",
    "the implication is that an imf with lower and upper mass limits in the range 0.1100  m@xmath7 can satisfactorily model the data , and a low - mass - stars  deficient imf is not required to explain the observations .",
    "in order to test the effectiveness of our crude fitting technique , we try to reproduce the observed spectra of two galaxies : the starburst prototype ngc  7714 ( weedman et al .",
    "1981 ) , and the bluest galaxy in our sample , ngc  4861 .",
    "the spectrum of ngc  7714 ( see figure  15 ) is corrected for reddening using e(b@xmath12v)=0.4 and the reddening values of table  5 and cks94 .",
    "the best fit for the spectrum and the emission line ews is given by a 1@xmath210@xmath3  yr population with constant sfr and two underlying populations with ages 1@xmath210@xmath8  yr and 5@xmath210@xmath8  yr . the flux from the three stellar populations accounts for 14% , 17% and 69% , respectively , of the k - band emission . the observed and predicted emission line ews are shown in table  7 .",
    "the results from this model suggest that ngc  7714 has been experiencing episodic or continuous star formation over the last 5@xmath210@xmath81@xmath210@xmath5  yr , as already concluded by gonzalez - delgado et al .",
    "if the sfr were to remain constant over a period of 10@xmath5  yr , the total mass produced by the star formation event would be @xmath16@xmath210@xmath5  m@xmath7 , comparable to the total hi mass in the galaxy",
    ". the k - band luminosity per unit of star formation rate and the stellar mass - to - light ratio predicted by the model are 2.67@xmath210@xmath5  l@xmath7  yr / m@xmath7 and 0.32  m@xmath7/l@xmath7 , respectively , to be compared with the values shown in table  8 .",
    "the observed m / l is about a factor 3.5 larger than the model",
    "m / l , implying that the use of an imf with mass range 0.1100  m@xmath7 is appropriate also for the case of ngc  7714 . a low - mass - stars  deficient imf does not seem required for this galaxy , unlike previous results ( bernlhr 1993 , and references therein ) .",
    "much of the difference between the present and previous conclusions on the imf can be attributed to the reddening corrections adopted by different authors for the luminosity . if the dust and stars are assumed to be mixed ( cf .",
    "bernlhr 1993 ) , the reddening corrected luminosities will be larger , and the m / l values smaller , than those obtained by assuming that the dust is foreground to the stars ( cf .",
    "satyapal et al .",
    "1995 , for the case of m82 ) .",
    "for instance , in a dust - star mixed geometry a measured e(b@xmath12v)=0.22 at optical wavelengths corresponds to a k - band optical depth @xmath102 and the ir stellar continuum must be corrected for a reddening factor 2.3 . in a foreground geometry",
    "the same value of the optical color excess corresponds to a k - band optical depth @xmath103 and to a reddening correction factor of only 1.06 for the ir stellar continuum .",
    "ngc  4861 strongly deviates from the average behavior of the other galaxies : its spectrum is the bluest in our sample , and the ews of its hydrogen emission lines are about one order of magnitude larger than the others ( cf .",
    "tables  2 and 3 ) .",
    "ngc  4861 is the closest approximation to a pure starburst population in the present sample .",
    "after reddening correction , using the same recipe as for ngc  7714 and e(b@xmath12v)=0.2 , the ngc  4861 spectrum is best fitted by the combination of a 4@xmath210@xmath81  yr constant sfr population with a 1.2@xmath210@xmath56  yr burst population ( figure  16a ) .",
    "the latter provides 52% of the k - band flux , 43% of the j - band flux , and 16% of the 0.65  @xmath0 m flux .",
    "however , this synthetic spectrum overpredicts the hydrogen line ews , expecially in the j and k bands ( see model  1 in table  7 ) . if we impose that the star - forming population can only originate from an instantaneous burst of star formation , then the best fitting synthetic spectrum is given by a combination of a 3@xmath210@xmath81  yr and a 1.2@xmath210@xmath56  yr burst population ( figure  16b ) , where the latter provides 62% of the k - band flux , 52% of the j - band flux , and 18% of the 0.65  @xmath0 m flux .",

    "the reddening of the stellar continuum is similar in value to that of the ionized gas , but the two values progressively diverge towards the uv . if a galactic - type extinction curve is adopted for the gas , the uv - bright stars are about 60% less reddened than the nebular gas ( cf .",

    "the fit of the `` template starburst spectrum '' with stellar population models requires at least three different components : a star - forming population , which is responsible for most of the uv emission , and two intermediate age populations , 1@xmath210@xmath8  yr and 5@xmath210@xmath8  yr old , respectively , which contribute to a large fraction of the optical and ir emission .",
    "the star - forming component is producing stars at a constant rate since @xmath12@xmath210@xmath3  yr , in agreement with the age limits placed to this component by the current supernova rates , measured from the [ feii ] emission line .",
    "the three stellar components which fit the `` template starburst spectrum '' are all relatively close in age and younger than 10@xmath5  yr . our fitting technique is not sophisticated enough to reveal whether more than three stellar components contribute to the mean spectrum , but the limiting case of continuous star formation over @xmath12@xmath210@xmath5  yr produces a synthetic spectrum which is still in general agreement with the observations .",
    "this suggests the that starburst activity in galaxies is continuous but episodic ( cf .",
    "waller 1991 ) and covers relatively long periods of time , up to @xmath112  gyr .",
    "past star formation episodes have been as efficient as or more efficient than the present one at producing stars , and the star formation history of a starburst galaxy is characterized by events with different levels of star formation strength .",
    "the galaxy very old population ( age @xmath110@xmath56  yr ) does not contribute significantly to the template starburst spectrum , since the best fit models do not require components older than @xmath110@xmath5  yr .",
    "this is an `` a posteriori '' justification for the use of a foreground dust distribution to de - redden the galaxy spectra : stellar populations younger than @xmath110@xmath5  yr may have been generated during star formation episodes which are associated with the current event .    a salpeter imf with mass range 0.1100",
    "m@xmath7 has been adopted through the analysis .",
    "this assumption has been checked against various observables , and no obvious contradiction has been found . the observed galaxy mass - to - light ratios are compatible with a low mass limit of about 0.1  @xmath104 , and there is no clear need for a low - mass - star  deficient imf . a high - mass - star  truncated imf is also in disagreement with the data ; a salpeter imf in the range 0.130  m@xmath7 can account for the small values of the nebular hydrogen line ews , but produces a synthetic spectrum which is much bluer than the `` template starburst spectrum '' .",
    "spectral energy distributions of local galaxies are often compared with spectra or multi - band photometry of intermediate and high redshift galaxies in an effort to pin down the stellar composition , and therefore , the star formation history of the progenitors of present - day galaxies ( e.g. , steidel et al . 1996 , madau et al . 1996 ) . in this respect ,",
    "the `` template starburst spectrum '' provides a baseline for comparisons with high - redshift star - forming galaxies , since it represents the the reddening - corrected uv - to - ir spectral energy distribution of a `` typical '' starburst galaxy , as derived from observations",
    ". however , metallicity differences may not be negligible between present - day and high - redshift galaxies , and comparisons should take this caveat into account .",
