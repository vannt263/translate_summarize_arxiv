    "the behavior of quantum many - body systems away from equilibrium has recently become the object of intense experimental study .",

    "the potential technological implications are profound because the manipulation of coherent quantum dynamics is at the root of the possibility of building a quantum computer .    in terms of theoretical description",
    ", systems away from equilibrium are considerably more complicated than their equilibrium counterparts .",
    "whereas equilibrium systems can be understood by means of standard methods like mean field theory and renormalization group , we lack analogous methods for understanding non - equilibrium physics @xcite .",
    "there are no obvious generalizations of such standard methods at equilibrium , and in particular , it is not clear to what extent the non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum systems features universality .",
    "an important example is the universality of the kibble@xmath3zurek mechanism to compute the density of defects as the external temperature is tuned in time @xcite .",
    "experiments on cold atomic gases give us the opportunity to observe a genuine quantum evolution in a system that is very close to be isolated .",
    "we can then address questions like the possibility of equilibration in a system with unitary evolution and the process of thermalization in a closed quantum system .",
    "these topics have recently found a renewed interest along with other fundamental problems in quantum statistical mechanics @xcite . in the case of such systems ,",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics is obtained by making some parameters of the system hamiltonian time - dependent and hence casting the system off equilibrium .",
    "the time dependence of the hamiltonian can be adiabatically slow @xcite or it can change abruptly @xcite in which case the process is called a _ quantum quench_. among other applications , the paradigm of the quantum quench has been recently used to study the behavior of topological phases away from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the understanding of non - equilibrium dynamics of isolated interacting quantum systems is of fundamental importance to understand quantum equilibration , a topic that has lately experienced a new renaissance @xcite . due to unitary time evolution , a _",
    "finite _ quantum system with a non - trivial initial state can not converge to a steady state .",
    "however , it has been shown in some remarkable papers @xcite that thermalization of a finite subsystem is possible in the infinite size limit . the system can be coarse grained by choosing a partial set of local or macroscopic observables , and the expectation values of these observables can in principle converge to the ones in thermal equilibrium .",
    "in particular , an integrable system does not thermalize : even local or macroscopic observables undergo oscillations , or at best relax to equilibrium values that are generally not the same as those predicted by the microcanonical ensemble @xcite . even for a non - integrable system",
    ", thermalization does not always occur : in some cases there is only relaxation to a non - thermal state depending on the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the equilibration process has several characteristic time scales .",
    "the largest one is the recurrence time @xmath5 at which the system gets infinitesimally close to its initial state .",
    "it only exists for finite systems , and diverges at least exponentially as a function of the system size .",
    "the smallest time scale is the relaxation time @xmath6 at which a given observable relaxes to its long - term average value .",
    "furthermore , there is a third important time scale @xmath7 in between at which _ revivals _ occur : these are brief detachments from the average value of an observable .",
    "revivals typically last for a very short time only ( in comparison to the spacing between them ) , and their magnitude decays in time as the equilibration process nears completion .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the structure of the revivals for an integrable model , the transverse field xy spin chain .",
    "our main result is that this structure is universal in the sense that it does not depend on the details of the quench and on the initial state . by applying non - integrable perturbations to the system and finding that the revival structure is surprisingly robust against such perturbations , we argue that the revival structure is a universal non - equilibrium property which follows from the locality of the hamiltonian .",
    "we consider a closed quantum system whose hamiltonian @xmath8 depends on parameters @xmath9 representing the coupling strengths of interactions and external fields .",
    "a quantum quench is a sudden change in the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the quantum system is originally prepared in the ground state @xmath10 of @xmath11 , and at time @xmath12 we switch the parameters to different values @xmath13 .",
    "the system then evolves unitarily with the quench hamiltonian @xmath14 according to @xmath15 , where we define the superoperator @xmath16 .",
    "unitary evolution implies that a finite system can not converge to a steady state @xmath17 , even weakly .",
    "the limit of @xmath18 for @xmath19 does not exist unless the initial state @xmath10 is trivial , e.g. , an eigenstate . on the other hand ,",
    "the time average @xmath20 always exists and is given by the @xmath10 totally dephased in the eigenbasis @xmath21 of the hamiltonian : @xmath22 .",
    "for a finite system , equilibration means that the expectation values of macroscopic observables spend most of their time very close to their average values .",
    "an important quantity describing the time evolution is the loschmidt echo ( le ) defined as @xmath23 which gives a measure of the distance between the time evolved state @xmath18 and the initial state @xmath10 . when the system undergoes a recurrence at @xmath24 we have @xmath25 .",
    "the general expression for the le can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the populations of the hamiltonian eigenstates for the initial state .",
    "it follows that the time average of the le is @xmath28 .",
    "the le typically decays in a short time @xmath6 from @xmath29 to its average value @xmath30 around which it oscillates .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath6 is @xmath31 for an off - critical quench , while it scales like @xmath32 with the system size @xmath1 for a critical quench , that is , if @xmath13 is a critical point , showing a critical _ slow - down _ of the system @xcite .",
    "revivals are also visible in the le as deviations from the average value @xmath30 . we define revivals as time instances at which the signal @xmath33 differs from @xmath30 by more than three standard deviations . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq - le-1 ] ) , this happens when an exceptionally large number of weights @xmath27 get partially back in phase .",
    "it is not straightforward to understand directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq - le-1 ] ) when such a situation can occur in a generic quantum system , therefore we consider the particular case of a simple one dimensional spin chain .",
    "in this section , we consider an integrable ( exactly solvable ) model , the one dimensional xy model of @xmath34 spins one half in a transverse magnetic field . since the model is exactly solvable",
    ", we can obtain the whole spectrum and the eigenstate decomposition of the initial state .",
    "this leads to an exact expression for the le , and the revival times can be extracted by inspecting its time dependence .",
    "the hamiltonian of this spin chain is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the anisotropy parameter , and @xmath37 is the external transverse magnetic field .",
    "we assume cyclic boundary conditions @xmath38 .",
    "the periodic ( @xmath39 ) and antiperiodic ( @xmath40 ) boundary conditions differ in @xmath41 terms and this difference usually does not affect the phase diagram or other quantities in the thermodynamic limit",
    ". however , it can be important in the le that is typically exponentially small in @xmath34 . in the following",
    ", we shall see that the boundary conditions can have a dramatic effect in the case of the critical quench .",
    "note that the xy model reduces to the quantum ising model for @xmath42 , and to the isotropic xx model for @xmath43 .",
    "the hamiltonian exhibits two regions of criticality : the xx model at @xmath43 has a critical region for @xmath44 , while the xy regions of criticality are the lines @xmath45 .",
    "the xy model can be diagonalized by a standard procedure @xcite .",
    "in the first step , we map @xmath46 to spinless fermions by using a jordan@xmath3wigner transformation : @xmath47 the translational symmetry is then exploited by the fourier transform @xmath48 , where the momenta are quantized according to @xmath49 .",
    "finally , after the bogoliubov transformation @xmath50 , we obtain a hamiltonian describing non - interacting fermionic degrees of freedom @xmath51 : @xmath52 the dispersion relation of these fermionic quasiparticles is given by @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and the angle @xmath55 appearing in the bogoliubov transformation is @xmath56 $ ] .      in a quantum quench ,",
    "the system is prepared in the ground state of @xmath11 , and then evolved with @xmath14 at @xmath57 .",
    "it is useful to write the ground state @xmath58 of the initial hamiltonian in terms of the eigenstates of the quench hamiltonian : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the vacuum state defined by @xmath62 .",
    "the time evolution then reads @xmath63 , and the le takes the form @xmath64 where the coefficient @xmath65 is a slowly varying positive function of the momentum @xmath66 .",
    "now we show how the revivals in the le can be derived from the dispersion relation @xmath67 of the quasiparticles .",
    "we first take the logarithm of eq .",
    "( [ eq - le-2 ] ) to transform the product into a sum over momentum @xmath66 : @xmath68 since each @xmath69 term has a periodicity @xmath70 in time , and @xmath71 varies sufficiently slowly with @xmath66 , this expression shows that nearby @xmath66 modes separated by @xmath72 add up constructively whenever @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "this rearranges to @xmath75 , and in principle we could expect a revival time @xmath76 corresponding to each @xmath66 .",
    "however , more modes can add up constructively if the dispersion relation @xmath67 is closer to a straight line , therefore the most pronounced revivals ( in fact , the only revivals that stand out from the background noise ) are given by the stationary values of the group velocity @xmath77 .",
    "the first of these revivals is the one corresponding to the maximal group velocity @xmath78 and we can thus give the following estimate for the revival time scale : @xmath79 the maximum group velocity @xmath2 can be computed exactly from the dispersion relation @xmath67 .",
    "it takes a particularly simple form in the case of the ising model ( @xmath80 ) : @xmath81 when @xmath82 and @xmath83 when @xmath84 .     +    in fig .",
    "[ fig-1a ] , the le for a critical quench ( @xmath85 ) with antiperiodic boundary conditions ( @xmath40 ) is plotted .",
    "the @xmath7 predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq - rev ] ) is in perfect agreement with the data .",
    "the same critical quench with periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath39 ) is interesting . at the odd revivals ,",
    "there is no signal in the le due to a destructive ( vanishing ) contribution from one of the @xmath66 modes in the product of eq .",
    "( [ eq - le-2 ] ) . only the even revivals are spotted .",
    "[ fig-1b ] and [ fig-1d ] verify that the revival times scale like @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the linear size of the system .",
    "the quench in fig .",
    "[ fig-1b ] is non - critical , and the parameters of the quench hamiltonian are far away from any phase boundaries .",
    "this means that the system is gapped , and a simple spectral analysis would imply that @xmath7 is of @xmath31 .",
    "however , even if there is a small reconstruction of the wave - function at a time scale @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 is a difference between any two energy levels ) , the weight involved is not sufficiently large to make the corresponding revival strong enough .",
    "_ visible revivals _ are governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq - rev ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig-1c ] , the system is quenched from different ground states corresponding to different parameter values @xmath90 .",
    "as one can see , the details of the evolution and the average values @xmath30 are different , but the structure of the revivals is the same for all the quenches , and the revival times are consistent with those predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq - rev ] ) .",
    "this is the promised _",
    "universality _ of the revival structure : the initial state and the size of the quench are unimportant .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 determine @xmath2 and therefore @xmath7 but not the fact that revivals happen at time instances spaced evenly at intervals that are linear in system size : @xmath91 .",
    "although the behavior of the le is illuminating for theoretical arguments , it is hardly of experimental relevance because the amplitude of the signal is zero in the thermodynamic limit . on the other hand",
    ", it is expected that a revival in the le corresponds to revivals in macroscopic observables as well . to demonstrate this",
    ", we study the time evolution of the order parameter ( magnetization ) @xmath92 @xcite and of the single spin entanglement entropy @xmath93 . if we consider a subsystem @xmath94 consisting of a single spin , the von neumann entropy between subsystem @xmath94 and the rest of the system is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath94 .    , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",

    "the horizontal lines represent average values and three standard deviations thereof . ]",
    "when the initial state of the quenching process in eq .",
    "( [ eq - state ] ) is expanded in position basis rather than momentum basis , one finds that the excitations are pairwise correlated between different lattice sites due to the fermionic anticommutation relations .",
    "this implies that @xmath96 is diagonal , and then we can use translational invariance to establish @xmath106 where the average magnetization is given by @xmath107 the entanglement entropy @xmath108 and the average magnetization @xmath109 are thus governed by the interference of the same modes as in eq .",
    "( [ eq - le-2 ] ) with their frequencies given by the same dispersion relation @xmath67 .",
    "this means that they share the same time scales as the le .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] .",
    "in fact , since the magnetization is given as a sum rather than a product of different oscillating modes it can be used instead of the le to determine @xmath7 in the large @xmath34 limit when the le has a very small average value . in practice ,",
    "the magnetization is analogous to the logarithmic loschmidt echo used in @xcite .",

    ", more such modes can add up constructively if the second derivative of @xmath67 vanishes , therefore we expect visible wave packets to travel with the stationary values of @xmath118",
    ". indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig-3a ] shows that the different wave packets corresponding to the local extrema of @xmath118 propagate through the lattice while maintaining their respective wave forms .",
    "the fastest wave packets travel with the maximal group velocity @xmath2 , and the first revivals can be interpreted as constructive interferences between them .",
    "since we assume cyclic boundary conditions , one can think of the spin chain as a closed ring . in this picture ,",
    "the fastest wave packets first meet halfway in the ring at time @xmath119 which indeed coincides with the first revival time in eq .",
    "( [ eq - rev ] ) .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that the structure of the revivals is governed by the maximal speed of quasiparticles in the system .",
    "we found that as long as the quasiparticles exist , the details of the quench are not relevant .",
    "there is universality within the integrable behavior of the system . at this point , we wonder whether there is universality beyond the quasi - free system . the local physics induced by the local hamiltonian might imply that as long as information is not completely lost @xmath3 as in the case of an infinite system @xmath3 revivals can be observed due to the recombination of the fastest signals even when these are not point - like and do not correspond to quasiparticles . to investigate this possibility , we now study the robustness of the revival structure against non - integrable perturbations .",
    "we start by considering the xz spin chain , which contains an additional @xmath120 coupling with respect to the quantum ising model ( @xmath42 ) : @xmath121 this hamiltonian is non - integrable , and we simulate the quantum quench by exact numerical diagonalization . to achieve a relatively large system size ( @xmath122 ) ,",
    "we take the limit of large field ( @xmath123 ) , restricting the effective hilbert space to states where almost all spins are aligned with the field .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the structure of the revivals is clearly visible for @xmath124 , and hence this structure is universal for a _ range _ of the non - integrability parameter @xmath125 .",
    "the revival times scale linearly with @xmath34 , and the range of visibility is largely independent of both the system size @xmath34 and the magnetic field @xmath37 .",
    "we find that pronounced revivals gradually disappear in the range @xmath126 for all @xmath127 when @xmath128 is fixed , and for all @xmath129 when @xmath130 is fixed .",
    "since @xmath131 in the ising model for @xmath84 , we see that the non - equilibrium dynamics is dominated by the @xmath132 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq - h-3 ] ) .",
    "the xz spin chain is therefore significantly non - integrable for @xmath133 , even in the @xmath134 limit .",
    "this claim is further supported by the fact that the visibility range in @xmath125 does not depend on @xmath37 .",
    "we finally note that the equilibrium ( long - term average ) value of the magnetization is strongly dependent on the initial state and so this equilibration is not thermalization , even though the system is non - integrable @xcite .",
    "now we consider another integrability breaking perturbation to the xy spin chain .",
    "we introduce a site dependent external field component @xmath135 to the hamiltonian that explicitly breaks the translational invariance and the integrability of the model .",
    "the total site dependent field is @xmath136 , where @xmath135 is randomly picked from a uniform distribution with a maximum amplitude @xmath137 in the sense @xmath138 .",
    "using exact diagonalization and exploiting the fact that the hamiltonian decomposes to subspaces of odd and even number of spins , we can assess the effect of the site dependent field disturbance for modest sized systems @xmath139 .",
    "the simulations run on such systems give supporting evidence that the revival structure is essentially unchanged for a range of the amplitude @xmath137 . in fig .",
    "[ fig-5 ] , the loschmidt echo for a critical and a non - critical system is plotted with various values of @xmath137 to illustrate this observation .",
    "we found in section [ sec - xy ] that the transverse field xy model exhibits a universal structure of revivals that is independent of the initial state and the size of the quench .",
    "since the xy model is integrable and its exact solution is in terms of free fermionic quasiparticles , there is a straightforward interpretation for the phenomenon of revivals .",
    "the information propagates around the system via wave packets of quasiparticles , and the first revival occurs when the wave packets traveling with the maximal group velocity @xmath2 meet .",
    "this interpretation explains the universality of the revival structure since @xmath2 only depends on the dispersion relation of the quasiparticles associated with the quench hamiltonian ( and nothing which would be related to the initial state ) .",
    "on the other hand , the robustness against non - integrable perturbations found in section [ sec - pert ] suggests something more generic than the quasiparticle interpretation .",
    "the quasiparticles of the perturbed system are no longer free but there is a finite interaction between them . for the xz spin chain ,",
    "this interaction is on the order of @xmath125 as can be verified by looking at the exact eigenvalues for finite systems .",
    "this implies that the quasiparticles decay on the time scale of @xmath140 , and hence one would not expect to see revivals at time scales much larger than @xmath140 . however , the evidence is on the contrary : at @xmath141 and @xmath142 , revivals are still clearly visible at @xmath143 , which is an order of magnitude larger than @xmath144 .",
    "it appears that the revival structure is a non - equilibrium property that is beyond integrability and the existence of stable quasiparticles .",
    "here we provide a more generic interpretation in terms of _",
    "quantum many - body physics is generally described by hamiltonians that can be written as sums of local operators .",
    "the locality of the hamiltonian has profound consequences on the dynamics of the system @xcite : there exists an emergent light cone for the propagation of information such that signals outside the light cone are exponentially suppressed .",
    "the characteristic speed of the light cone gives the maximal speed of information in the system , and it is called the lieb@xmath3robinson speed @xmath4 . in general , it depends on both the graph of the system and the strengths of the interactions in the hamiltonian .",
    "we speculate that the revival structure described in the previous sections is much more generic and valid whenever a many - body quantum system has local dynamics , as long as the integrability breaking is not too strong and hence information is not completely lost in the system .",
    "since the propagation of information is governed by @xmath4 , the revival time scale becomes @xmath145 in general . in the integrable case",
    ", @xmath4 reduces to the quasiparticle speed @xmath2 , and hence we recover the revival time scale in eq .",
    "( [ eq - rev ] ) . on the other hand , the locality of the dynamics is intact in the non - integrable case as well , providing a natural explanation for the robustness of the revival structure .",
    "in this paper , we studied the phenomenon of revivals after a quantum quench in the transverse field xy model , and found a non - trivial revival structure that can not be obtained from a simple spectral analysis .",
    "it was shown that this structure is universal in the sense that it does not depend on the initial state and the size of the quench .",
    "revivals were shown to be related to quasiparticles propagating around the system with a finite maximum speed @xmath2 , and a corresponding estimate for the revival time scale was established .",
    "we also investigated the effect of non - integrable perturbations on the structure of the revivals .",
    "in particular , we considered the xz spin chain and a random disorder in the magnetic field .",
    "it was found that the revival structure is clearly visible at time scales far beyond the lifetime of quasiparticles , implying that something more generic than integrability is behind the phenomenon of revivals . in perspective of this",
