    "the logistic equation was introduced in 1845 by the belgian mathematician and sociologist pierre - franois verhulst to model the growth of populations limited by finite resources @xcite .",
    "the discrete time variable version of verhulst s growth law , the logistic map , has become a foundation stone for the theory of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the logistic map is the archetypal example of how the use as starting point of simple non - linear discrete maps have often led to significant developments in the theory of non - linear dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the universal properties associated to the renowned period - doubling and intermittency routes to chaos displayed by the logistic map , similar to those of conventional critical phenomena in statistical physics , triggered , about three decades ago , an upsurge of activity in the field and now both routes , as well as many other remarkable features displayed by the logistic map , are well understood .",
    "here we might argue that at the present time the logistic map is again becoming a prototypical model system .",
    "this time for the assessment of the validity and understanding of the reasons for applicability of the nonextensive generalization of the boltzmann gibbs ( bg ) statistical mechanics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is a formalism assumed to be appropriate for circumstances where the system is out of the range of validity of the canonical bg theory . and",
    "these circumstances are believed in some cases to be a breakdown in the chain of increasing randomness from non - ergodicity to completely developed phase - space mixing .",
    "the logistic map contains infinite families of critical attractors at which the ergodic and mixing properties breakdown .",
    "these are the tangent bifurcations and the accumulation point(s ) of the pitchfork bifurcations , the so - called onset of chaos @xcite . at each of",
    "the map critical attractors the lyapunov coefficient @xmath3 vanishes , and the sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath2 for large iteration time @xmath4 ceases to obey exponential behavior , exhibiting instead power - law or faster than exponential behavior .",
    "the pitchfork bifurcations are also critical attractors at which the negative lyapunov coefficient of periodic orbits goes to cero .",
    "there are other attractors at which the lyapunov coefficient diverges to minus infinity , where there is faster than exponential convergence of orbits .",
    "these are the superstable attractors located between successive pitchfork bifurcations and their accumulation point is also the onset of chaos .    here",
    "we review briefly specific and rigorous results on the dynamics associated to the critical attractors of the logistic map , or of its generalization to non - linearity of order @xmath5 , @xmath6,@xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "( the phase space variable is @xmath9 , the control parameter is @xmath10 and the conventional logistic map corresponds to @xmath11 ) .",
    "our results relate to the anomalous sensitivity to initial conditions at the onset of chaos , the associated spectrum of tsallis @xmath0-lyapunov coefficients , and the relationship of these with the mori @xmath0-phase transitions @xcite , one of which was originally observed numerically for the feigenbaum attractor @xcite @xcite .",
    "in particular , we identify the mori singularities in the lyapunov spectra with the appearance of special values for the tsallis entropic index @xmath0 . as the properties of the logistic map are very familiar and well understood it is of interest to see how previous knowledge fits in with the new perspective .",
    "tsallis suggested @xcite that for critical attractors @xmath2 ( defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the initial separation of two orbits and @xmath14 that at time @xmath4 ) , has the form @xmath15\\equiv [ 1-(q-1)\\lambda _ { q}(x_{0})\\ t]^{-1/(q-1 ) } ,   \\label{sensitivity1}\\ ] ] that yields the customary exponential @xmath2 with @xmath3 when @xmath16 . in eq .",

    "tsallis also suggested @xcite that the pesin identity @xmath19 @xmath20 ( where the rate of entropy production @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 , @xmath4 large , and @xmath23 ) would be generalized to @xmath24 @xmath25 , where the @xmath0-generalized rate of entropy production @xmath26 is defined via @xmath27 , @xmath4 large , and where @xmath28 is the tsallis entropy ; @xmath29 is the inverse of @xmath30 .    to check on the above",
    ", we have analyzed recently @xcite-@xcite both the pitchfork and tangent bifurcations and the onset of chaos of the logistic map and found that indeed the tsallis suggestions hold for these critical attractors , though with some qualifications .",
    "for the case of the tangent bifurcation it is important to neglect the feedback mechanism into the neighborhood of the tangency to avoid the crossover out of the @xmath0-exponential form for @xmath2 . as we explain below , for the onset of chaos",
    "there is a multiplicity of @xmath0-indexes , appearing in pairs @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and a spectrum of @xmath0-lyapunov coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 for each @xmath31 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "( the superindex @xmath37 refers to starting and final trajectory positions ) .",
    "the dynamics of the attractor confers the @xmath0-indexes a decreasing order of importance . retaining only the dominant indexes @xmath38 and @xmath39 yields a quite reasonable description of the dynamics and considering the next few leading indexes provides a satisfactorily accurate account .",
    "although in brief , we also describe our finding @xcite that the dynamics at the noise - perturbed edge of chaos in logistic maps is analogous to that observed in supercooled liquids close to vitrification .",
    "the three major features of glassy dynamics in structural glass formers , two - step relaxation , aging , and a relationship between relaxation time and configurational entropy , are displayed by orbits with vanishing lyapunov coefficient .",
    "the known properties in control - parameter space of the noise - induced bifurcation gap play a central role in determining the characteristics of dynamical relaxation at the chaos threshold .",
    "for our purposes it is convenient to recall some essentials of logistic map properties . the accumulation point of the period doublings and also of the chaotic band splittings is the feigenbaum attractor that marks the threshold between periodic and chaotic orbits , at @xmath40 , with @xmath41 when @xmath11 .",
    "the locations of period doublings , at @xmath42 , and band splittings , at @xmath43 , obey for large @xmath44 power laws of the form @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with @xmath47 when @xmath11 , which is one of the two feigenbaum s universal constants .",
    "for our use below we recall also the sequence of parameter values @xmath48 employed to define the diameters @xmath49 of the bifurcation forks that form the period - doubling cascade sequence . at @xmath50 @xmath48 the map displays a ` superstable ' periodic orbit of length @xmath51 that contains the point @xmath52 . for large @xmath44",
    "the distances to @xmath52 , of the iterate positions in such @xmath51-cycle that are closest to @xmath52 , @xmath53 , have constant ratios @xmath54 ; @xmath55 when @xmath11 , which is the second of the feigenbaum s constants .",
    "a set of diameters with scaling properties similar to those of @xmath56 can also be defined for the band splitting sequence @xcite .",
    "other diameters in the @xmath51-supercycles are defined as the distance of the @xmath57th element @xmath58 to its nearest neighbor @xmath59 .",
    "that is @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "feigenbaum @xcite constructed the auxiliary function @xmath62 to quantify the rate of change of the diameters and showed that it has finite ( jump ) discontinuities at all rationals , as can be seen by considering the variable @xmath63 with @xmath44 large ( and therefore omitting the subindex @xmath44 ) .",
    "one obtains @xcite",
    "@xcite @xmath64 , but @xmath65 , and through the antiperiodic property @xmath66 , also @xmath67 , but @xmath68 .",
    "other discontinuities in @xmath69 appear at @xmath70etc . as these decrease rapidly in most cases it is only necessary to consider the first few .",
    "an important factor of our work is that the sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath71 can be evaluated for trajectories within the feigenbaum attractor via consideration of the discontinuities of @xmath72 .",
    "if the initial separation is chosen to be a diameter @xmath73 and the final time @xmath4 is chosen to have the form @xmath74 , then @xmath75 , and @xmath71 can be written @xcite as @xmath76 for clarity of presentation , we shall only use absolute values of positions so that the dynamics of iterates do not carry information on the self - similar properties of `` left '' and `` right '' symbolic dynamic sequences @xcite .",
    "this choice does not affect results on the sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "during the late 1980 s mori and coworkers developed a comprehensive thermodynamic formalism to characterize drastic changes at bifurcations and at other singular phenomena in low dimensional maps @xcite .",

    "each of these transitions is related to a discontinuity in the @xmath1 function of diameter ratios , and this in turn implies a @xmath0-exponential @xmath2 and a spectrum of @xmath0-lyapunov coefficients for each set of orbits .",
    "the transitions come in pairs with specific conjugate indexes @xmath0 and @xmath133 , as these correspond to switching starting and finishing orbital positions .",
    "since the amplitude of the discontinuities in @xmath1 diminishes rapidly , in practical terms there is only need of evaluation for the first few of them .",
    "the dominant discontinuity is associated to the most crowded and sparse regions of the attractor and this alone provides a very reasonable description , as found in earlier studies @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "thus , the special values for the tsallis entropic index @xmath0 in @xmath289 are equal to the special values of the variable @xmath0 in the formalism of mori and colleagues at which the @xmath0-phase transitions take place .",
    "as described , the dynamics of noise - perturbed logistic maps at the chaos threshold presents the characteristic features of glassy dynamics observed in supercooled liquids .",
    "in particular our results are @xcite : i ) the two - step relaxation that takes place when @xmath186 is obtained in terms of the bifurcation gap properties , specifically , the plateau duration @xmath239 is given by a power law in the noise amplitude @xmath179 .",
    "ii ) the map analog of the adam - gibbs law is given also as a power - law relation between @xmath258 and the entropy @xmath290 associated to the noise widening of chaotic bands .",
    "iii ) the trajectories at @xmath291 are shown to obey a scaling property , characteristic of aging in glassy dynamics , of the form @xmath292 @xmath293 where @xmath241 is a waiting time .",
    "the limit of vanishing noise amplitude @xmath186 ( the counterpart of the limit @xmath294 in the supercooled liquid ) brings about loss of ergodicity .",
    "this nonergodic state with @xmath295 corresponds to the limiting state , @xmath186 , @xmath256 , for a family of small @xmath199 states with glassy properties , which are expressed for @xmath253 via the @xmath0-exponentials of the tsallis formalism .",
    "it has been suggested on several occasions @xcite @xcite that the setting in which nonextensive statistics appears to come out is linked to the prevalence of nonuniform convergence , such as that involving the thermodynamic @xmath296 and the infinitely large time @xmath81 limits . here",
    "a similar situation happens , that is , if @xmath297 is taken before @xmath81 a nonergodic orbit restrained to the feigenbaum attractor and with fully - developed glassy properties is obtained , whereas if @xmath81 is taken before @xmath298 a chaotic orbit with @xmath255 would be observed",
