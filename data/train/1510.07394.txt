    "in today s networks , relay - based transmission is adopted to bridge large distances between a source and a destination . in this work , we investigate the two - hop relay channel comprised of a source , a relay , and a destination , where a direct link between the source and the destination does not exist .",
    "there are two main modes of relay operation , the full - duplex ( fd ) mode and the half - duplex ( hd ) mode . in the fd mode ,",
    "the relay transmits and receives at the same time and in the same frequency band . as a result ,",
    "self - interference ( si ) caused by the relay s transmit signal impairs the received signal and can cause a severe degradation of the achievable rate of the relay channel .",
    "therefore , often the hd mode is preferred for practical implementations , where the relay transmits and receives either in different frequency bands or in different time slots to avoid si .",
    "information theoretical analyses of the capacity of the two - hop hd relay channel were provided in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thereby , it was shown that the capacity of the hd relay channel can not be achieved by schemes using a fixed transmission / reception schedule for the relay . instead , for the gaussian two - hop hd relay channel",
    ", the optimal relay input symbol distribution is discrete and includes a zero symbol , while the source transmits gaussian distributed symbols when the relay transmits a zero symbol and is silent otherwise , see @xcite . hence , in each symbol interval either the source or the relay transmit a zero symbol . thereby , the positions of the zero symbols at the relay are dependent on the data received from the source . therefore , as the positions of the zero symbols in the codeword of the relay are random for the destination , the relay s zero symbols also carry information .    on the other hand , the latest advances in hardware design have shown that it is in principle possible to suppress the si at the relay to such an extent that the fd mode outperforms the hd mode .",
    "as the transmit power of fd nodes is about 100 db higher than the noise floor , elaborate si mitigation techniques are necessary , see @xcite",
    ". if the si is canceled completely , the ideal fd relay channel , consisting of two successive additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels , results . for the ideal fd relay channel ,",
    "the capacity achieving input distributions at the source and the relay are gaussian , see @xcite , @xcite . however , in practice even after performing si mitigation , the residual si from the transmitted signal to the received signal is not negligible , and hence , its influence has to be taken into account .",
    "the achievable rates of the fd relay channel for gaussian input distributions at the source and the relay were already derived in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite investigated the achievable rates of the fd multiple - input multiple - output relay channel using gaussian input distributions . in order to optimize the transmission rate ,",
    "a hybrid hd / fd scheme was proposed in @xcite , where the transmission rates of conventional hd relaying and conventional fd relaying were compared in order to switch between hd and fd transmission depending on the instantaneous channel state .",
    "thereby , both the hd and the fd transmission schemes employed gaussian input distributions at the relay and at the source to transmit over the gaussian two - hop relay channel , which is not optimal in general , see @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "the capacity of the gaussian two - hop fd relay channel is studied , where the source - relay and relay - destination links are both affected by awgn .",
    "the residual si at the relay is modeled as a gaussian distributed additive noise whose variance is proportional to the instantaneous power of the symbol transmitted at the relay in the same symbol interval .",
    "we show that , in order to achieve the capacity of the considered channel , the source has to use gaussian signaling where the variance of the source symbols depends on the power of the si , and as a consequence , depends on the relay s transmit symbols .",
    "this dependence leads to a waterfilling solution , where the source decreases its transmit power for increasing power of the relay s transmit symbol .",
    "in fact , when the amplitude of the transmit symbol of the relay exceeds a certain threshold , the source is silent .",
    "the optimal distribution of the relay input symbols is shown to be gaussian as long as the relay - destination link is the bottleneck of the end - to - end transmission .",
    "otherwise , the relay employs a discrete input distribution in order to keep its influence on the source - relay channel small .",
    "we numerically compare the capacity of the gaussian fd two - hop relay channel with the capacity of the gaussian hd two - hop relay channel and the achievable rates of conventional fd and hd transmission . here , conventional fd relaying",
    "is shown to be nearly capacity achieving for all cases , where fd relaying significantly outperforms hd relaying .",
    "in this section , we present the models adopted for the gaussian fd two - hop relay channel and the si .",
    "the source - relay and the relay - destination channels are both assumed to be awgn channels .",
    "the source - relay channel is additionally impaired by si noise caused by the relay transmit symbols .",
    "there is no direct link between the source and the destination .",
    "therefore , the received symbols at the relay , @xmath0 $ ] , and the destination , @xmath1 $ ] , can be modeled as functions of the transmitted symbols at the source , @xmath2 $ ] , and the relay , @xmath3 $ ] , as follows @xmath4&=h_{sr}x_1[k]+h_{rr}x_2[k]+n_r[k]\\label{r1}\\\\ r_2[k]&=h_{rd}x_2[k]+n_d[k],\\label{r2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denote the coefficients of the channel from the source to the relay , the si channel at the relay , and the channel from the relay to the destination , respectively",

    ", @xmath6 has to be estimated .",
    "the estimate , @xmath15 , can be modeled as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the estimation error . as the signal received at the relay for estimation of @xmath6",
    "is corrupted by awgn , the estimate , @xmath15 , is also corrupted by gaussian noise , and therefore the estimation error , @xmath17 , is gaussian distributed with zero mean and variance @xmath18 .",
    "thereby , the value of @xmath18 depends on the employed estimation scheme , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , after removing the contribution of @xmath19 $ ] , the received symbols at the relay can be modeled as @xmath20&=h_{sr}x_1[k]-\\tilde{h}_{rr}x_2[k]+n_r[k],\\label{r3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 .",
    "as @xmath17 is multiplied with the relay transmit symbol @xmath3 $ ] , the residual si in symbol interval @xmath22 is gaussian distributed with zero mean and variance @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "hence , if the relay does not transmit or transmits a zero symbol , there is no si noise , and therefore hd relaying is obtained as a special case .",
    "furthermore , the si noise power scales linearly with the instantaneous relay transmit power , which is in agreement with measurement results obtained for the residual si noise power , see e.g. @xcite . note that an alternative model used in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite assumes that the si power depends on the average relay transmit power .",
    "we note that , in practice , all channel coefficients , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , have to be estimated .",

    "<S> in this work , the capacity of the gaussian full - duplex ( fd ) two - hop relay channel with self - interference ( si ) is studied . in the two - hop relay channel , </S>",
    "<S> the source transmits data to a relay , which forwards the data to the destination , and a direct link between the source and the destination is not present . since the relay is assumed to be fd , the relay is transmitting and receiving at the same time and in the same frequency band . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a practical fd relay , where the si caused by the transmitted signal to the received signal is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , the si is modeled as an additive gaussian random noise whose variance is proportional to the instantaneous power of the transmit signal . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the capacity of the gaussian fd two - hop relay channel is achieved either by a gaussian or by a discrete input distribution at the relay . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the capacity achieving distribution at the source is gaussian with a varying variance in the form of a waterfilling power allocation across different symbols . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically compare the capacity of the gaussian fd two - hop relay channel with the achievable rates of conventional fd relaying , optimal half - duplex ( hd ) relaying , and conventional hd relaying . here , conventional fd relaying </S>",
    "<S> is shown to be nearly capacity achieving for all cases , where fd relaying significantly outperforms hd relaying . </S>"
