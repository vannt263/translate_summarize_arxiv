    "the isotopic composition of nuclear reaction products provides important information on the reaction dynamics and the possible occurrence of a liquid - gas phase transition  @xcite .",
    "isotopically resolved light fragments have revealed systematic scalings  @xcite that supply information on neutron and proton densities at the breakup stage . the isoscaling has been observed in a variety of reactions under the assumptions of statistical emissions and equal temperature and volume of the two considered systems .",
    "our study was devoted to select central collisions , inspect the characteristics of the source formed in the central events ( size , temperature and volume ) , and examine the isotopic ratios .",
    "in particular , using fragments with a charge @xmath5 identified in mass , we studied the isoscaling and the isotopic ratios for mirror nuclei .",
    "we present data concerning @xmath0sn+@xmath1ni and @xmath2sn+@xmath3ni central collisions at 35 amev .",
    "the measurements have been performed using the 688 si - csi telescopes of the forward part ( @xmath6 ) of chimera apparatus in the framework of reverse experiments  @xcite .",
    "in order to have an impact parameter selector we resorted to the principal component analysis ( pca ) , which is a multivariate analysis technique  @xcite concerned with determination of the so - called principal variables , linear combinations of the primary physical variables . in our case , the first three principal components ( p1 , p2 , p3 ) define principal planes where the data retain about 80% of the original information .",
    "the experimental events , projected on the p1-p2 plane , show three well distinct clouds .",
    "two bumps correspond to events that can be associated to peripheral collisions .",
    "the third cloud mostly contains well detected multifragmentation events , characterized by high imf multiplicity .",
    "a variable summarizing both the information provided by p1 and p3 allows for a more careful selection in order to separate central and semi - peripheral collisions and to select events with an isotropic distribution of @xmath7 .    to get information on the characteristics of the source , formed in central collisions , we performed a comparison between data and statistical model ( smm  @xcite ) predictions .",
    "the statistical model reproduces quite well the experimental observables ( fig .",
    "[ smm ] ) if , for n - poor ( rich ) reaction , a source is considered having mass @xmath8 , charge @xmath9 , excitation energy @xmath10 and a freeze - out volume of @xmath11 .",
    "these source characteristics are in good agreement with the predictions of the dynamical model bnv  @xcite , which predicts for the n - poor ( rich ) reaction that an equilibrated excited system with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 mev is formed at a time 120 - 140 fm / c after the initial stage of the collision .",
    "[ ht ]    information about the space - time evolution of the reaction zone has been obtained via intensity interferometry . the two - fragments velocity correlation function for imfs",
    "( @xmath15 reveals that the sources formed in @xmath0sn+@xmath1ni and @xmath2sn+@xmath3ni central collisions decay by emitting fragments and isotopes showing almost identical space - time patterns  @xcite .",
    "the temperatures of the two sources were extracted by looking at the double isotope ratios thermometers  @xcite .",
    "the temperature is given by @xmath16 where s is related to the ground state spins , r is the ratio of the production yields of four isotopes and @xmath17 is related to the isotope binding energies .",
    "the measured yields of isotopes from lithium to oxygen were used to construct the so - called apparent temperatures ; their values and the values after secondary decay correction  @xcite are presented as a function of the binding energy term b in the right box of fig .",
    "the deduced values of the temperatures are in the range typical for reaction processes near the onset of multi - fragment emissions  @xcite .",
    "the weighted average corrected temperatures result @xmath18 and @xmath19mev for @xmath2sn+@xmath3ni and @xmath0sn+@xmath1ni reactions respectively .",
    "having verified that the sources of the two analysed systems present the same size , temperature , volume and emission patterns , we moved on to study the isotopic ratios . in the grand - canonical approximation the yield ratio @xmath20 of a fragment of n neutrons and z protons , emitted in two reactions differing only in isospin , is related to the relative free neutron density and to the relative free proton density by the relation ( neglecting the particle unstable feeding corrections  @xcite ) : + @xmath21 + c is an overall normalization factor and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the relative free neutron and proton densities , related to the isoscaling parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite . in fig .  [ isoscaling ]",
    "the measured isotopic ratios are plotted as a function of neutron number ( left upper panel ) and proton number ( left lower panel ) of fragments . on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ isoscaling ] the mirror isobar ratios are shown .",
    "if the sequential decay and the coulomb effects are small , the dependence of isobaric mirror yield ratios on the binding energy difference should be exponential , i.e. of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the temperature of the emitting source for the reaction @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the free neutron and proton densities for the same reaction",
    ".      a constrained fit on the 27 experimental ratios of fig .",
    "[ isoscaling ] has been performed .",
    "the average corrected isotope temperature is assumed as the temperature of the emitting systems . the relative neutron and proton densities @xmath22 , @xmath23 , c and the free neutron to proton density @xmath31 ( for the reaction @xmath0sn + @xmath1ni ) were used as free parameters of the fit .",
    "the @xmath32 for the reaction @xmath2sn + @xmath3ni has been derived as @xmath33 . a very good agreement with an exponential behaviour",
    "has been obtained giving values @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( corresponding to isoscaling parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it can be observed that the extracted values of @xmath22 and @xmath32 result definitely higher than the values calculated ( 1.08 , 1.41 and 1.18 ) assuming neutrons and protons homogeneously distributed in a volume proportional to the nucleons number , supporting the idea of the isospin distillation mechanism .",
    "even if this can be a signal expected for a liquid - gas phase transition further analyses are required to evaluate secondary decay effects .",
