    "the relaxation behavior depends strongly on the presence or absence of a harmonic component in the potential , and , in some respects , on dimensionality .",
    "first we consider the purely anharmonic arrays .",
    "the dimensionality plays a particularly important role in this case .    in one dimension the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ energydecay ] shows an essentially purely exponential decay ( verified separately ) , which is characteristic of a single predominant decay channel .",
    "the decay is more rapid at higher temperatures .",
    "note that there are no phonons in this purely quartic system , so that single frequencies are not associated with normal modes of the system .",
    "conversely , exact solutions of the fpu chain such as solitons and intrinsic localized modes may involve many frequencies .",
    "the second frame in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ spectrumdecay ] shows that the higher frequencies decay first , exactly opposite to the harmonic chain .",
    "we find that the relaxation pathway is for the high frequency portions of the spectrum to degrade rapidly into lower frequency excitations , as schematically indicated by the sloped arrows in fig .",
    "[ figswesq ] . the lowest frequencies decay into the reservoir and define the exponential decay rate seen in fig .",
    "[ energydecay ] . in more detail ,",
    "the high frequency components of the spectrum are mainly due to highly mobile localized modes that degrade into lower energy ( less mobile ) excitations as they move and collide with one another .",
    "the lowest frequency excitations are in turn absorbed into the cold reservoir but continue to be replenished through the degradation process .",
    "it is important to note , however , that among the low frequency excitations are some that persist for a very long time , certainly beyond the times of our simulations .",
    "their decay is surely slower than exponential , perhaps a stretched exponential .",
    "these , the only remaining spectral components at time @xmath59 , are  labeled \" by short downward arrows in the relaxation schematic and include rather stable breather and/or soliton modes that move very slowly and are localized away from the boundaries .",
    "also , some direct relaxation of all frequency components into the reservoir occurs as well ( shown schematically by the short arrows at high frequencies in fig .",
    "[ figswesq ] ) , but this direct relaxation is slower than the energy degradation pathway .",
    "for example , when a highly mobile localized excitation reaches a boundary , it typically remains at the boundary for about one period of oscillation ( which is short for a highly energetic excitation ) , during which it loses a small portion of its energy to the reservoir .",
    "the remaining excitation is reflected back into the chain , where it will continue to lose energy through other collision events and/or re - arrival at the boundaries .",
    "the role of high - frequency mobile modes and of low - frequency slowly moving or stationary modes in this picture will be tested in more detail in the next section , where we explicitly inject a high - frequency localized mode into the array and observe the relaxation dynamics .",
    "we do note here that our picture is consistent with known facts about localized states .",
    "in particular , it is known that higher - frequency and/or higher amplitude localized modes can move at higher velocities  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that while in motion such modes lose energy through collisions with other excitations .",
    "figure  [ energydecay ] shows a faster decay at higher temperatures , which is consistent with our observations elsewhere that the speed of an injected pulse ( and therefore , we conjecture , the speed of a moving localized mode ) in these arrays increases with temperature  @xcite .",
    "= 4.in = 4.in",
    "the relaxation dynamics of the purely anharmonic array in two dimensions differs from the one - dimensional case in a number of ways .",
    "first , we note that the decay of the energy in fig .",
    "[ energydecay ] is ( except for very early times ) slower in the hard array than in the harmonic one over the times of observation .",
    "second , except for an initial short time interval , the decay is found not to be exponential , indicating that there is no longer a single predominant decay channel as there was in one dimension . in two dimensions the relaxation pathway again includes degradation of higher frequency excitations to lower frequencies , as can be seen in the spectral rendition in fig .",
    "[ spectrumdecay ] . however , whereas in one dimension the degradation process is faster than the decay of low frequency excitations into the reservoir ( and hence this latter decay is the rate - limiting step that defines the total energy decay process ) , here the degradation process is slower , leading to spectral bottlenecks and competing time scales .",
    "we find that increasing the array size leads to slower degradation of the high frequency components and to more pronounced spectral bottlenecks in the mid - frequency range .",
    "our physical picture of the source of the competing time scales involves the observation that in two dimensions , localized excitations are not nearly as mobile as in one dimension . in one dimension energy degradation",
    "occurs as a consequence of high mobility and the resultant inevitable frequent scattering .",
    "the reduced mobility in two dimensions was noted in earlier work on pulse propagation  @xcite and will be supported and clarified in the next section , where we explicitly inject a high - amplitude breather into our system . at long times in the 2d system excitations of all energies",
    "eventually reach the boundaries .",
    "these excitations typically lose some of their energy into the cold reservoir and the remainder is reflected back into the array , where it either degrades into lower energy components or reaches a boundary again with the attendant energy loss .",
    "note also that with increasing temperature the total system energy decays more rapidly , which is consistent with our assertion that mobility ( low as it may be ) in the purely hard arrays increases with temperature because of the participation of more mobile higher frequency components in the initial equilibrium mix of excitations .",
    "the result is an energy decay that is of stretched exponential form , @xmath60 as is evident in the first panel of fig .",
    "[ figexp ] , where we plot @xmath61/d\\ln t \\beta(t ) = \\frac{d}{d\\ln t } \\ln \\left [ -\\ln \\left(\\frac{e(t)}{e(0)}\\right)\\right]\\ ] ] as a function of time for four purely anharmonic 2d arrays of different sizes , damping coefficients , and temperatures . when the decay is a stretched exponential this rendition gives a flat line at the value @xmath62 .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath63 is independent of temperature , as seen in the figure ( we have tested this assertion for various lattice sizes in the range @xmath64 ) , and that it increases with @xmath25 , as also seen in the figure . for the @xmath65 lattices we find that @xmath63 is around @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "the temperature independence is explained by the fact that temperature does not dominate the mobility of the residual excitations nor does it determine their rate of energy loss once they reach a boundary . on the other hand ,",
    "it is reasonable that increasing @xmath25 leads to a faster long - time relaxation process ( larger @xmath63 ) because more energy is lost to the reservoir upon each collision .",
    "we find that @xmath63 also increases with @xmath1 , which is somewhat of a puzzle .",
    "we find , for instance , that in a @xmath70 array with @xmath67 ( and for any temperature ) @xmath71 .",
    "the issue of the size dependence of relaxational processes following a stretched exponential behavior is a difficult problem that has only recently been addressed in a different context  @xcite . in summary , for the purely anharmonic 2d arrays @xmath72    the mixed arrays , i.e. , those with interactions that have both quadratic and quartic potential contributions , are of course the ubiquitous fpu systems since it is difficult to envision a  real \" physical system that has no quadratic potential terms ( one might also say this about cubic potential terms that have not been included here  @xcite ) .",
    "the thermal relaxation of these arrays proceeds similarly in one and two dimensions . at early and intermediate times the mixed arrays",
    "relax very similarly to the harmonic arrays ( i.e. , exponential decay followed by power law decay ) , albeit somewhat modified and speeded up by the presence of high - frequency mobile excitations in addition to the low - frequency phononic excitations .",
    "the rapid decay of both low and high frequency excitations is evident in the third frames of both panels in fig .",
    "[ spectrumdecay ] .",
    "this similarity in one dimension was noted by piazza et al .",
    "@xcite . after some time",
    ", however , the mixed chain relaxation behavior changes to a stretched exponential .",
    "this occurs when the low frequency modes have essentially all decayed .",
    "the higher frequency spectral components that persist are localized long - lived excitations ( note that high - frequency phonon modes are unstable against breather formation in these systems  @xcite ) . unlike the purely anharmonic array , here there is no low - frequency residue to perturb the high - frequency localized excitations and so they survive relatively unperturbed and immobile for a long time .",
    "the persistence of high - frequency spectral components is seen in the third frames of both panels in fig .",
    "[ spectrumdecay ] , and the schematic representation of the progression in one dimension is shown in fig .",
    "[ figswesq ] .",
    "the slow leakage of breather energy into low energy modes that continue to dissipate into the cold reservoir is responsible for the eventual stretched exponential relaxation of the system .",
    "these behaviors can be seen clearly in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ figexp ] which shows @xmath73 for various 1d and 2d mixed arrays . the initial exponential behavior ( which corresponds to a flat curve at @xmath74 ) , occurs over too short a time scale to be clearly discernible .",
    "there then follows a power law decay regime which eventually turns to a stretched exponential . in the power law regime , if the energy decays as @xmath75 then it follows that @xmath76 , which is independent of @xmath77 and depends only on the ratio @xmath78 via @xmath79 .",
    "the two 2d curves and the 1d curve with the same value of @xmath78 are all seen to decay with the same slope .",
    "as all the curves settle into their asymptotic behavior , we see that @xmath63 depends neither on @xmath1 nor on @xmath25 : the two 1d arrays are of different sizes but asymptote to the same @xmath63 ( approximately @xmath80 ) , as do the two 2d arrays of the same size and initial temperature but with different damping coefficients ( @xmath81 ) . on the other hand , the 2d arrays that have different initial temperatures asymptote to different values of @xmath63 ( approximately @xmath82 for @xmath83 and around @xmath84 for @xmath85 ) .",
    "the observed behavior is explained by the fact that the slow leakage of energy out of the long - lived localized excitations is rate limiting .",
    "a higher initial temperature leads to more energetic , more stable breathers with slower leakage , hence explaining why @xmath63 decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "neither the size of the system nor the damping coefficient are important in this limit , since the slowest process is the leakage .",
    "the low - energy outcome of that leakage is absorbed quickly by the cold reservoir .",
    "note that this description is consistent with that provided for relaxation of lattices with local anharmonic potentials  @xcite . in summary , for 1d and 2d arrays with quadratic plus quartic interaction potentials @xmath86    it is interesting to stress that , like an inverse power law decay , a stretched exponential can indeed be obtained from a distribution or hierarchical progression of decay times .",

    "if the distribution of relaxation times varies as @xmath88 , then the decay will go as a stretched exponential with @xmath89 at long times ( the stretched exponential with @xmath90 is the only one whose associated distribution is expressible in extremely simple analytic form , but distributions associated with other fractional exponents are also known analytically or numerically  @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath110 is the initial point of highest energy in the chain and @xmath111 is the point of maximum energy at time @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , in two dimensions we define @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the initial point of highest energy and @xmath114 is the point of maximum energy at time @xmath52 .    in a purely anharmonic chain in one dimension , a short time after it is created the excitation begins to move essentially ballistically in one direction or the other with equal probability .",
    "the motion continues for a period of random duration , until the excitation stops moving for a random period of time .",
    "then it moves again in either direction .",
    "whatever its initial parity , while subsequently stationary the excitation has even parity ( the more stable of the two configurations ) .",
    "any perturbation ( usually scattering of slow low - frequency excitations ) that disturbs this parity sets the breather in motion , and while it moves it alternates between even and odd parity . the excitation only loses energy while in motion , through collisions with persistent low - frequency excitations .",
    "= 4.in    a typical mean squared displacement for the one - dimensional purely anharmonic array is shown in fig .",
    "[ figrr ] .",
    "the mean square displacement follows the superdiffusive law @xmath115 with @xmath116 over the entire lifetime of the excitation .",
    "this particular exponent is recovered for the purely quartic chain under all conditions that we have tested , that is , independently of force constant , excitation amplitude , and temperature .",
    "parameter variations affect only the prefactor , which reflects the breather velocity .",
    "indeed , it does not matter _ when _ in the course of the relaxation process the localized excitation is introduced : its mean squared displacement grows with the same exponent @xmath117 until the excitation is extinguished into the background .",
    "this confirms the role of the persistent low - frequency excitations . we have argued  @xcite that this particular superdiffusive exponent can be understood in terms of scattering events that occur with a time distribution @xmath118  @xcite .    in a purely anharmonic two - dimensional array",
    "the motion is rather different ( which is consistent with the spectral differences in one and two dimensions ) .",
    "a typical mean squared displacement is also shown in fig .",
    "[ figrr ] .",
    "the law is now sub diffusive , @xmath119 with @xmath120 over the lifetime of the excitation .",
    "again , this exponent is insensitive to force constant , excitation amplitude , and temperature changes .",
    "it does reflect the fact that the excitation moves much less in two dimensions than in one ( although it does of course move and eventually recedes into the background ) . in earlier work",
    "@xcite we noted that a pulse in a one dimensional purely hard array tends to move more rapidly but remains more tightly concentrated than a pulse in , say , a harmonic or soft array .",
    "we also noted that in two ( or more ) dimensions these two tendencies are in some sense contradictory since the only way that a symmetric excitation can move is by breaking its symmetry and/or dispersing .",
    "the sort of perturbation that would set a breather in motion requires an asymmetry that is more difficult to achieve in two dimensions than in one .",
    "if the distribution of collision times of energetic breathers with other excitations that can set it in motion has sufficiently long quiescent periods ( long - tailed waiting time probability distribution function ) then the motion of the excitations is typically subdiffusive  @xcite .",
    "note that this does not preclude collisions that lead to energy loss by the breather even if it is not set in motion .",
    "the situation in mixed anharmonic arrays is similar in one and two dimensions , see fig .",
    "[ figrr ] .",
    "the injected excitations at first move with the same characteristic exponents @xmath77 as in the corresponding purely anharmonic systems , but as the harmonic interactions sweep the background thermal energy out of the system , the localized excitations stop moving .",
    "the mean squared displacement in each dimension then becomes independent of time ( earlier in two dimensions than in one ) .",
    "energy relaxation in one- and two - dimensional nonlinear arrays with quartic interparticle interactions ( fermi - pasta - ulam or fpu arrays ) proceeds along energetic pathways completely different from those of harmonic systems and is quite sensitive to the presence or absence of quadratic contributions to the interactions .",
    "relaxation in a purely harmonic array involves the sequential decay of independent phonon modes starting with those of lowest frequency and moving upward across the spectrum .",
    "the decay of energy in these arrays is exponential at short and long times , but follows an inverse power law at intermediate times . throughout the decay process",
    ", the energy is distributed uniformly over the entire array .",
    "a localized excitation injected in the lattice simply decays according to the distribution of characteristic relaxation times of its phonon components .",
    "fpu arrays with quadratic and quartic interactions contain phonon - like modes as well as high - energy nonlinear , and to varying degrees localized , excitations ( provided the initial temperature is sufficiently high to excite these ) .",
    "the relaxation process involves the decay of phonons in the same spectral order as in the harmonic arrays and also energy losses through collisions of mobile high - energy localized excitations as they collide with lower - frequency ones .",
    "eventually the harmonic interactions succeed in  sweeping \" the system clean of low energy excitations and the remaining localized modes are quasistationary breather solutions that persist for a very long time .",
    "the decay to this quasistationary state is a stretched exponential with an exponent that depends on temperature but not on system size or damping coefficient .",
    "an explicitly injected high - energy localized breather follows this behavior , with a mean squared displacement that at first grows with time but then becomes independent of time when the system has been swept clean of background excitations .",
    "the greatest differences between one- and two - dimensional fpu arrays occur in the purely quartic arrays . in all cases",
    "the relaxation begins from the high - frequency end of the spectrum ( opposite to the harmonic case ) and involves not a direct absorption by the cold reservoir but rather a degradation of high - frequency excitations to lower - frequency ones . in one dimension",
    "this degradation process is considerably faster than in two dimensions .",
    "the lowest frequency modes in one dimension are absorbed by the cold reservoir but are quickly replenished by the degradation process .",
    "the energy relaxation is essentially exponential , with a time constant determined by the decay of the lowest frequency components . in two dimensions the degradation process is slower and there are frequency bottlenecks so that the decay of the lowest frequency excitations into the cold reservoir no longer constitutes the rate limiting process .",
    "instead , the degradation and decay contribute to a resulting stretched exponential energy decay with an exponent that depends on system size and damping coefficient but is independent of temperature . in both one and two dimensions there",
    "remains a thermal residue of localized low - frequency excitations that continue to perturb and degrade higher frequency ones .",
    "the array is never  swept clean \" of low - energy excitations as is the mixed array , and therefore no persistent breathers occur in this system . in order to confirm this behavior we have followed the dynamics of an injected high - frequency localized excitation in these arrays . in one dimension",
    "this localized excitation remains localized but is very mobile throughout its lifetime , being characterized by a super - diffusive mean squared displacement . in two dimensions",
    "the excitation also remains localized and is much less mobile ( but nevertheless , always mobile until it disappears ) , being characterized by sub - diffusive motion .",
