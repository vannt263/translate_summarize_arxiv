    "in recent works , we have developed connections and a variational formalism to treat deformed or metric derivatives , considering the relevant space - time/ phase space as fractal or multifractal @xcite and presented a variational approach to dissipative systems , contemplating also cases of a time - dependent mass @xcite .",
    "the use of deformed - operators was justified based on our proposition that there exists an intimate relationship between dissipation , coarse - grained media and a limit energy scale for the interactions .",
    "concepts and connections like open systems , quasi - particles , energy scale and the change in the geometry of spacetime at its topological level , nonconservative systems , noninteger dimensions of spacetime connected to a coarse - grained medium , have been discussed . with this perspective",
    ", we argued that deformed or , we should say , metric or structural derivatives , similarly to the fractional calculus ( fc ) , could allows us to describe and emulate certain dynamics without explicit many - body , dissipation or geometrical terms in the dynamical governing equations .",
    "also , we emphasized that the paradigm we adopt was different from the standard approach in the generalized statistical mechanics context @xcite , where the modification of entropy definition leads to the modification of the algebra and , consequently , the concept of a derivative @xcite .",
    "this was set up by mapping into a continuous fractal space @xcite which naturally yields the need of modifications in the derivatives , that we named deformed or , better , metric derivatives @xcite .",
    "the modifications of the derivatives , accordingly with the metric , brings to a change in the algebra involved , which , in turn , may lead to a generalized statistical mechanics with some adequate definition of entropy .    the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation sets out as a fundamental approach to describe physics in the field of applied magnetism .",
    "it exhibits a wide spectrum of effects stemming from its non - linear structure , and its mathematical and physical consequences open up a rich field of study .",
    "we pursue the investigation of the llg equation in a scenario where complexity may play a role .",
    "the connection between llg and fractionality , represented by an @xmath1deformation parameter in the deformed differential equations , has not been exploited with due attention . here , the use of metric derivatives aims to take into account long - range forces , possible non - manifest or hidden interactions and/or the dimensionality of space .    in this contribution , considering intrinsically the presence of complexity and possible dissipative effects , and aiming to tackle these issues , we apply our approach to study the llg equation with two metric or structural derivatives , the recently proposed scale @xmath2derivative @xcite in the nonextensive statistical mechanics and , as an alternative , the axiomatic metric derivative ( amd ) that has the mittag - leffler function as eigenfunction and where deformed leibniz and chain rule hold - similarly to the standard calculus - but in the regime of low - level of fractionality .",
    "the deformed operators here are local .",
    "we actually focus our attention to understand whether the damping in the llg equation can be connected to some entropic index , the fractionality or even dimensionality of space ; in a further step , we go over into anisotropic heisenberg spin systems in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions with the purpose of modeling the weak anisotropy effects by means of some representative parameter , that depends on the dimension of space or the strength of the interactions with the medium . some considerations about an apparent paradox in the magnetization or angular damping is given .    our paper is outlined as follows : in section 2 , we briefly present the scale@xmath2derivative in a nonextensive context ; in section 3 , we cast some helpful mathematical aspects ; in section 4 , we build up an axiomatic local metric derivative ; we tackle the problem of the llg equations as an example for application of our approach in section 5 .",
    "we finally present our conclusions and outlook in section 6 .",
    "some initial claims here coincide with our work of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have recently suggested that the approaches mentioned above are in fact based on local operators @xcite .    in this sense",
    ", there emerges a question : is it possible to have a local deformed operator whose eigenfunctions could be the mittag - leffler function and preserves the non - violated form of leibniz rule , with some easy form for chain rule , even if the rules were considered as approximations ?",
    "this is our actual goal here . to propose some local deformed or metric derivatives that should satisfy those requests , but being local and an approximation for low level of fractionality ( order parameter close to @xmath3 ) .    here",
    ", in this section , we provide some brief information to recall the main forms of deformed or metric derivative .",
    "the readers may see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "the local differential equation @xmath4 with convenient initial condition , yields the solution given by the q - exponential , @xmath5 @xcite , were @xmath6 is the @xmath0exponential .",
    "the key of our work here is the scale@xmath2derivative ( sq - d ) that we have recently defined as @xmath7\\frac{df(x)}{dx}.}\\label{eq : q - derivative redef}\\ ] ]    the eigenvalue equation holds for this derivative operator , as the reader can verify : @xmath8    the solution to eq.([eq : eigenvalue ] ) with this sq - d is @xmath9 .      with the aim to obtain a scale@xmath2deformed heisenberg equation , we now consider the @xmath10derivative @xcite @xmath11 and the scale -@xmath0deformed schrdinger equation @xcite , @xmath12 that , as we have shown in @xcite , is related to the nonlinear schrdinger equation referred to in refs .",
    "@xcite as nrt - like schrdinger equation ( with @xmath13 compared to the @xmath0index of the reference ) and can be thought as resulting from a @xmath14deformed - derivative applied to the wave function @xmath15 .",
    "considering in eq.([eq : schrodinger scale - q ] ) , @xmath16 the @xmath0evolution operator naturally emerges if we take into account a @xmath14deformed - derivative ( do not confuse with formalism of discrete scale time derivative ) : @xmath17 here , @xmath18is a constant for dimensional regularization reasons . note that the q - deformed evolution operator is neither hermitian nor unitary , the possibility of a @xmath0unitary as @xmath19 could be thought to come over these facts . in this work , we assume the case where the commutativity of @xmath20 and @xmath21 holds , but the @xmath0unitarity is also a possibility .",
    "now , we follow similar reasonings that can be found in ref.@xcite and considering the sq - d .",
    "so , with these considerations , we can now write a nonlinear @xmath22deformed heisenberg equation as @xmath23,\\label{eq : q - heisenberg}\\ ] ] where we supposed that @xmath20 and @xmath21 commute and @xmath18 is some factor only for dimensional equilibrium .      to build up the scale@xmath2 deformed landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation",

    "@xmath26 here , @xmath27 is some effective hamiltonian whose form that we shall clearly write down in the sequel .",
    "the scale@xmath2deformed momentum operator is here defined as @xmath28\\frac{\\partial^{q}}{\\partial x^{q}}.$ ]    considering this operator , we obtain a deformed algebra , here in terms of commutation relation between coordinate and momentum @xmath29=\\imath[1+\\lambda(1-q')x]\\hbar m_{q'}\\delta_{\\imath j}i\\ ] ] and , for angular momentum components , as @xmath30=\\imath[1+\\lambda(1-q')x]\\hbar m_{q}\\hat{l}_{k}^{q}.\\ ] ] the @xmath31 factor in @xmath32 is only an index and @xmath33 is not necessarily equal to @xmath34    the resulting scale@xmath2deformed llg equation can now be written as @xmath35g_{q}\\mu_{b}}{\\hbar m_{q}}\\hat{s_{q}}\\times\\vec{h}_{eff}.\\label{eq : scale - q - deformed llg}\\ ] ]    take @xmath36 @xmath37g_{q}\\mu_{b}}{\\hbar m_{q}}.$ ]    if we consider that the spin algebra is nor affected by any emergent effects , we can take @xmath38    considering the eq.([eq : q - heisenberg ] ) with @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; we obtain the @xmath0time deformed llg dynamical equation for magnetization as    @xmath42    considering @xmath43 we have the solution :    @xmath44    in the figure , @xmath45        increase/ damping- @xmath46 .",
    "now , to compare results with two different local operators , we apply the axiomatic metric derivative .",
    "following the steps on @xcite and considering the axiomatic md @xcite , there holds the eigenvalue equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the mittag - leffler function that is of crucial importance to describe the dynamics of complex systems .",
    "it involves a generalization of the exponential function and several trigonometric and hyperbolic functions .",
    "the eigenvalue equation above is only valid if we consider @xmath49 very close to @xmath50 this is what we call low - level fractionality @xcite .",
    "our proposal is to allow the use o leibniz rule , even if it would result in an approximation .",
    "so , we can build up an * * evolution operator : @xmath51 and for the deformed heisenberg equation    @xmath52,\\label{eq : fhe}\\ ] ]    where we supposed that @xmath53 and @xmath21 commute .    to build up the deformed landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation",
    ", we use the eq .",

    "@xmath56 here , @xmath27 is some effective hamiltonian whose form that we will turn out clear forward .",
    "now , consider the deformed momentum operator as @xcite @xmath57    taking this operator , we obtain a deformed algebra , here in terms of commutation relation for coordinate and momentum @xmath58=\\imath\\gamma(\\alpha+1)\\hbar^{\\alpha}m_{\\alpha}\\delta_{\\imath j}i\\ ] ] and for angular momentum components as @xmath59=\\imath\\gamma(\\alpha+1)\\hbar^{\\alpha}m_{\\alpha}\\hat{l}_{k}^{\\alpha}.\\ ] ]    the resulting the @xmath1deformed llg equation can now be written as @xmath60    if we take @xmath61 @xmath62 we can re - write the equation as the @xmath1deformed llg @xmath63    with @xmath43 we have the solution of eq.([eq : llg_m fract ] ) : @xmath64    in the figure below , the reader may notice the behavior of the magnetization , considering @xmath45    q-    \\a ) damping of oscillations . in the figure @xmath65 .",
    "b ) increase of oscillations .",
    "for @xmath66 the solution reduces to @xmath67 , the standard simple harmonic oscillator solution for the precession of magnetization .",
    "the presence of complex interactions and dissipative effects that are not explicitly included into the hamiltonian can be seen with the use of deformed metric derivatives . without explicitly adding up the gilbert damping term ,",
    "the damping in the oscillations could reproduce the damping described by the gilbert term or could it disclose some new extra damping effect . also , depending on the relevant parameter , the @xmath0 entropic parameter or for @xmath49 , the increasing oscillations can signally that it is sensible to expect fractionality to interfere on the effects of polarized currents as the slonczewski term describes .",
    "we point out that there are qualitative similarities in both cases , as the damping or the increasing of the oscillations , depending on the relevant control parameters . despite that , there are also some interesting differences , as the change in phase for axiomatic derivative application case .    here",
    ", we cast some comments about an apparent paradox : if we make , as usually done in the literature for llg , the scalar product in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q - llg equation for m ] ) with , @xmath68 we obtain an apparent paradox that the modulus of @xmath69does not change . on the other hand , if instead of @xmath70we proceed now with a scalar product with @xmath27 and we obtain thereby the indications that the angle between @xmath71and @xmath27 does not change .",
    "so , how to explain the damping in osculations for @xmath72 this question can be explained by the the following arguments .",
    "even the usual llg equation , with the term of gilbert , can be rewritten in a form similar to eq .",
    "llg without term of gilbert .",
    "( 2.7 ) in the ref .",
    "the effective @xmath27 field now stores information about the interactions that cause damping . in our case , when carrying out the simulations , we have taken @xmath27 as a constant effective field . here",
    ", we can argue that the damping term , eq .",
    "( 2.8 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite being small , this would cause the effective field @xmath73 to be approximately @xmath74 . in this way",
    ", the scalar product would make dominate over the term of explicit dissipation .",
    "this could , therefore , explain the possible inconsistency .",
    "in short :      with this aim , we have applied scale -@xmath0derivative and the axiomatic metric derivative to build up deformed heisenberg equations .",
    "the evolution operator naturally emerges with the use of each case of the structural derivatives .",
    "the deformed llg equations are solved for a simple case , with both structural or metric derivatives .",
    "these two points are relevant in connection with fractionality and the recent high precision measurements in magnetic systems may open up a new venue to strengthen the relationship between the fractional properties of space - time and condensed matter systems .",
