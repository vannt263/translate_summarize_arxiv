    "<S> these non - markovian processes are relevant for many biological phenomena , such as the unzipping of dna @xcite , translocation of polymers through nanopores @xcite , subdiffusion of macromolecules inside cells @xcite and single - file diffusion @xcite .    in the above applications , </S>",
    "<S> often the tagged particle is subject to either pinning by an elastic spring or absorption . </S>",

    "<S> the second situation arises when a reactant attached to a single monomer encounters an external reactive site fixed in space @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> these problems are relevant for practical applications : the pinning by optical tweezers is indeed elastic , while harmonic absorption mimics well a finite interval with absorbing boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> our approach naturally incorporates the initial condition of the system . in the following , we specifically consider a one - dimensional rouse chain , and mention higher dimensions in the conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> our main results , summarized in table [ table1 ] , show that while the steady state is independent of the initial condition , the transient behavior exhibits very strong memory effects : ( i ) if a quench in temperature is performed at @xmath8 , the msd displays a bump in time and converges to the steady state value as a power law . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior , predicted for both pinning and absorption , could be observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) for harmonic absorption , the absorption time distribution decays exponentially with a characteristic time which is independent of the initial condition . </S>",
