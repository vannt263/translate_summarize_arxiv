    "this complex generalization of classical lefschetz fibrations in algebraic geometry was introduced by boris moishezon in the late seventies for the study of complex surfaces from the differentiable viewpoint @xcite .",
    "lefschetz fibrations on a closed oriented smooth 4-manifolds have crucial role in 4-manifolds theory as they form the natural stage for investigating the boundaries among the three different structures on 4-manifolds namely differentiable , symplectic and holomorphic structures .",
    "each of the three structures have fascinating stories of their on 4-manifolds , on rigid extreme one has the enriques  kodaira classification classifying the compact complex surfaces into ten classes @xcite while on flexible extreme one has the freedman s classification classifying the simply - connected smooth compact 4-manifolds upto homeomorphism by the intersection form @xcite . in the middle , however , the 4-manifolds theory is far from completion due to the existence of infinite number of distinct smooth structures through the lenses of smooth invariants namely donaldson , seiberg  witten and gromov  witten and the lack of symplectic invariants facilitated much of the past and current research directions in geometry and topology .    in the late ninties ,",
    "simon donaldson established a remarkable result on the existence of symplectic lefschetz pencils on arbitrary symplectic manifolds @xcite .",
    "this implies that after appropriately blowing up basepoints of the symplectic lefschetz pencil one acquires symplectic lefschetz fibrations on any given symplectic manifolds .",
    "conversely , by the observation of robert gompf the total space of differentiable lefschetz fibration has a symplectic structure that is unique up to isotopy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of differentiable lefschetz fibrations is essentially equivalent to the study of symplectic manifolds .    naturally , one is curious about how far smooth lefschetz fibrations are from holomorphic ones .",
    "a lefschetz fibration is called _ holomorphic _ if the total space @xmath12 is a complex surface , and for a suitable complex structure on the base sphere @xmath18 the fibration map @xmath11 is holomorphic . in dimension 4 , the basic invariants of a given lefschetz fibration are the genus of the regular fibers , the number and types of singular fibers . and we define the isomorphism in lefschetz fibrations as the following ,    two genus g lefschetz fibrations @xmath11 , @xmath19 are _ isomorphic _ if there are orientation preserving diffeomorphisms @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that @xmath22 .    by the work of gromov and mcduff , any genus 0 lefschetz fibrations are in fact holomorphic .",
    "they are ruled surfaces over @xmath23 which are either @xmath24 or @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "likewise , for genus 1 the classification of elliptic lefschetz fibrations by moishezon and livn @xcite implies holomorphicity in all cases .",

    "the 4manifold @xmath36 is khler and the lefschetz fibration @xmath37 is holomorphic .",
    "classification of elliptic lefschetz fibrations stems from the simplicity of @xmath38 the mapping class group of the torus .",
    "one can perform the ( symplectic ) fiber sum operation in complex category by the cyclic @xmath39fold branched covering construction which can be applied to @xmath40 branched along 2 regular fibers to construct a complex elliptic surface which is diffeomorphic to the 4-manifold @xmath41 acquired by the fiber sum construction . in this way we can talk about @xmath41 as complex surfaces .",
    "given such a concrete classification of elliptic lefschetz fibrations , one could naturally consider the moduli space @xmath6 of elliptic holomorphic genus @xmath42 lefschetz fibrations over @xmath17 with @xmath7 number of singular fibers and a distinguished section .",
    "different points in the moduli @xmath6 corresponds to putting a different complex structure on @xmath41 , while they are isomorphic as elliptic lefschetz fibrations , since each fiber is a torus ( an elliptic curve ) but its complex structure might change from fiber to fiber ( with varying @xmath43-invariants ) .",
