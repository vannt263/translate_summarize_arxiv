    "at the very heart of applications such as quantum cryptography , computation and teleportation lies a fascinating phenomenon known as `` entanglement''the spooky , distance - defying link that can form between objects such as atoms even when they are completely shielded from one another @xcite .",
    "this type of correlation between particles is the deepest difference between quantum and classical world @xcite @xcite @xcite , and is also the key to realize `` qubits '' , the unit of quantum information and future quantum computer . because the photon is the best particle to carry information and to propagate it to a distant receiver at the fastest speed , realizing photon - photon and multi - photon entanglement is the best choice for future photonic applications @xcite .",
    "now scientists have realized two- , four- , six- , and even more photon entanglement using parametric down - conversion and other nonlinear optical technologies ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is hard to operate on photons directly , so it is necessary to study other particles entanglement and their coupling with photons . until now",
    ", successful quantum entanglement has also been demonstrated with individual ions and atoms ( see for example this review paper @xcite ) , electrons in superconductors @xcite , and coupling superconductor qubits to cavity light mode @xcite .",
    "however all of these apparatuses are either too big for application or dependent on tough conditions ( like ultralow temperature ) to maintain the entangled states , in other words , they are far from practical applications . only in recent years have people made considerable progress in acceptable conditions with integrable entangled solid state systems @xcite  like semiconductor quantum dots @xcite , photonic crystals @xcite  and has `` spintronics '' come into the science and technology community @xcite @xcite .",
    "it turns out electronic spin is a good carrier that can be used for computing and storing information at the same time  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "what s more , it is also easy to be coupled to polarized photons , which is believed to be a better way to enlarge our information transmitting capability without costing more energy and fibers  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite . for the practical application in quantum memory for future computer",

    "the probability of building a quantum computer basing on diamond and defects , like the nv center , is well confirmed by many research groups @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the electron structure of nv center in diamond is widely studied using different methods @xcite , and the difficulties of entanglements among the spaced nv centers @xcite and coupling to superconductor circuits @xcite , integrated to photonic cavities @xcite and microrings  @xcite are also overcome very recently .    however , it is a real challenge to realize the entanglement between electronic spin and polarized photon in nv centers in diamond @xcite @xcite .",
    "there are several difficulties .",
    "for example , the energy bands are very complex compared with individual ions and atoms exposing to the crystal environment . and",
    "it is hard to modulate the energy level structures to include two electronic spin states with almost the same energy gap to transfer to the common ground or excited states to easily operate and generate entanglement between photons and spins . in 2010 ,",
    "coherent operation and entanglement between electronic spins in nv center and polarized photons are performed successfully by buckley and togan and their teams @xcite @xcite .",
    "emre togan and collaborators reported their work in august 2010 @xcite , first - time showed the stable entanglement between spin state and photon polarization in a solid - state material which potentially can be demonstrated in room temperature .",
    "buckley s work was reported in nov 2010 @xcite , on coherence control experiment for single spin in diamond , with the faraday effect ( fe ) and the optical stark effect ( ose ) observed under scheduled exciting pulse series .",
    "fe is usually a tool to control polarization rotating of emitted light from solid system . and",
    "ose can cause energy band structure adjust and luminescence spectrum shift if an ultrafast ( usually in femtosecond scale ) laser pulse is applied on the sample .",
    "the ose has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally in qds of semiconductor systems ( see , for example , the first experimental observation of ose in semiconductor qd @xcite ) and other solid optical systems @xcite , and has been used as a tool to control single electron and photon or phonon interaction in solid nanostructures in recent years @xcite .",
    "these two effects are important for quantum operations ( see for example @xcite @xcite ) .    in togan and buckley s work , they all used the @xmath0 singlet state as the excited state and a pair of lower @xmath1 magnetic momentum states as the ground states , and operated the system with tunable 637 nm lasers .",
    "their results show a promising way toward diamond , or more generally , solid - system based , quantum logical gates , multi - spin - photon entangled network , and other practical applications in related fields .",
    "this article will mainly focus on these two experimental reports and represent their results using a unified model .      before we move onto the in - depth discussion ,",
    "let s briefly introduce the basic theory of entanglement in general .",
    "as discussed in gerry and knight s book @xcite , the four bell states are given by    @xmath2    where `` h '' and",
    "`` v '' are orthogonal states with `` opposite '' properties , for example , spin - up versus spin - down , polarized - to - z versus polarized - perpendicular - to - z , and so on . if a quantum system is in one of the four bell states , then we can say this system is in a `` maximally entangled '' state .",
    "`` maximally entangled '' means that when we trace over quantum substate b to find the density operator @xmath3 of quantum substate a , we obtain a multiple of the identity operator .",
    "for example , let s consider a polarized photon a and a spinning electron b are in the state of @xmath4 , we have @xmath5 similarly , @xmath6 .",
    "this means that if we measure photon a polarized along any axis , the result is completely random , we find polarization parallel to the axis with probability @xmath7 and polarization perpendicular to the axis with probability @xmath7 .",
    "this is also true for measuring b s spin state .",
    "therefore , if we perform any local measurement of a or b , we acquire no information about the preparation of the state , instead we merely generate a random bit ( number set combined with 0 or 1 ) .",
    "however , when we repeat our measurements on a and b , if we get the state of a , then the state of b is acquired . because a and b have some correlation . as gerry and knight s definition",
    ", the correlation function can be written as @xmath8,\\ ] ] which means the average of probing a in state h while b in state v. here , a is in h then @xmath9 , otherwise , a is not in h , then @xmath10 .",
    "similar to b(v ) .",
    "for the @xmath11 state s case , we can write @xmath12 and @xmath13 thus that @xmath14 .",
    "that means when we know photon a is in h state , then we are sure that spin b is in state v. because h and v is different , we call this entanglement as non - parity or antialigned entanglement . in contrast",
    ", there are parity or aligned entanglement , if a and b are always with the same type of states .",
    "this conditional probability can be measured and verified among the statistics on a large number sets of measurement experiments .",
    "if we span our measurement basis in the form of bell states , we can get the other correlation function for conditional measurement . and",
    "if any of the correlation function gives a value greater than 0.5 , then the system is in an entangled state .    for a full description of entanglement ,",
    "entropy and negativity are important conceptions , you can find more details in @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite give a systematical introduction on multi - particle ( bipartite , cluster , ghz and so on ) entanglement and measurement methods . and",
    "besides the discrete type ( like spin states ) entanglement , some continuous variables can also be entangled , like momentum , position , energy and so on .",
    "a theoretical introduction can be found in @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "our discussion in this essay is basically on the theory and experimental methods to establish a @xmath4 type entanglement between a polariton and an electronic spin in negatively charged nv center of diamond .",
    "the essay , therefore , includes the following topics : a simple but unified quantum optical theory to describe the polariton - spin interaction ( both off - resonant and on - resonant dynamics ) in nv center of diamond , the nv center s electronic structure and possible level structure to perform a good spin - polariton entanglement , represent one recent experiment  its methods and results  using our model . through the course of theoretical analysis , i will also explain the phenomena of faraday effect ( fe ) and optical stark effect ( ose ) , which are inevitable effects to consider , and point out some possible errors in two highly impacted articles .",
    "from this part we mainly reference and compared with the experimental results and theoretical analysis of two up - to - date articles and one perspective article : @xcite , published in nov 2010 , @xcite , published in aug 2010 , and @xcite as a comment on @xcite , published in _ science _ in nov 2010 .",
    "i will build up a unified theory frame mainly inspired by buckley s article , using the knowledge i have learned through the course , to explain the reported phenomena of faraday effect ( fe ) , optical stark effect ( ose ) , spin echo and entanglement generation between nitrogen vacancy center electronic spin and photon , and to point out some new discoveries and argument through comparing my calculation with published results . to make our discussion well readable ,",
    "some contents are cited from the original papers without notice , and some parts will be highlighted with colored fonts to distinguish my disparate arguments with the publication .",
    "now let s consider the nitrogen - vacancy center under a coherent laser pump and excited from ground state to excited state .",
    "the initial and final states for the joint spin - photon system can be written as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 are the bare ground ( excited ) states of the nv center orbital transition to spin number @xmath17 state , and @xmath18 is a photon - number state of the electromagnetic field , @xmath19 .",
    "as the energy splitting between different @xmath20 states is so small compared with the detuning , we can safely simplify the interested energy levels into a two - level system , with a formalism similar to jaynes - cummings model .",
    "the energy level structure is shown in fig.[jclevel ] .",

    "if we try to excite the pure @xmath37 ground state to the excited state with a resonant laser pulse of length @xmath182 , then the system will evolve to the excited state at the end of the pulse .",
    "we call this kind of pulse a @xmath183-pulse . while if the pulse length @xmath184 , it has no effect on the system .",
    "so , this kind of @xmath185-pulse is a transparent pulse to the system .",

    "to better control the quantum state of spin and accurately realize spin - photon entanglement , we need to consider the fine or even hyperfine level structures of the spinning electrons of the nv center ( here , negatively charged ) in the diamond crystal environment .",
    "there have been many approaches used to obtain the energy band structure , for example , local density function method @xcite , many - body perturbation model @xcite , etc . in this section",
    ", i would like to calculate the matrix of the system s hamiltonian with spin - spin and spin - orbit interaction , strain @xcite , @xcite , @xcite terms . and use group theory s results to confirm the basis of electron states and transition selection rules with impact on the photon s polarization .    in the absence of external strain and electric or magnetic fields , properties of the six electronic excited states",
    "are determined by the nv center s @xmath188 symmetry and spin - orbit and spin - spin interactions ( shown in fig.[energysplitting1 ] ) .",
    "optical transitions between the ground and excited states are spin preserving , but could change electronic orbital angular momentum depending on the photon polarization .",
    "two of the excited states , labeled @xmath189 and @xmath190 according to their orbital symmetry , correspond to the @xmath125 spin projection .",
    "therefore they couple only to the @xmath191 ground state and provide good cycling transitions , suitable for readout of the @xmath191 state population through fluorescence detection .",
    "the other four excited states are entangled states of spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "specifically , the @xmath192 state has the form @xmath193 where @xmath194 are orbital states with angular momentum projection @xmath195 along the nv axis , where @xmath196 denotes the magnetic sublevel states with @xmath127 .",
    "similarly , we denote @xmath125 spin states with @xmath197 . at the same time , the ground states ( @xmath198 ) are associated with the orbital state @xmath199 with zero angular momentum projection ( for simplicity , the spatial part of the wavefunction is not explicitly written ) .",
    "hence , owing to total angular momentum conservation , the @xmath192 state decays with equal probability to the @xmath200 ground state through @xmath201 polarized radiation and to @xmath202 through @xmath203 polarized radiation ( here , circular polarizations are represented by @xmath204 , while linear polarizations are represented by @xmath205 and @xmath206 ) . in other words , if we can trigger a photon from the electron transition from @xmath192 to the ground states @xmath207 , we can entangle the frequency and spin state information into the polarized photon and easily verify the fidelity of entanglement by reading out the photon s polarization and frequency information and comparing this with our knowledge of the electron structure of the nv center .",
    "all of these properties make the @xmath208 singlet state ( sometimes people use @xmath209 to differentiate this singlet state from the triplet state @xmath210 which finally forms the singlet state under interaction with the atomic environment ) a good candidate for spin - photon entangling in diamond nv center . and , it is vital to determine the level structure of related states before we carry out any entanglement scheme designs .",
    "the inevitable presence of a small strain field , characterized by the strain splitting @xmath211 of @xmath212 reduces the nv center s symmetry and shifts the energies of the excited state ( @xmath210 ) levels according to their orbital wavefunctions .",
    "a group theory study of the nv center in diamond @xcite , tells us that a small strain will not change the polarization of the transited photon , such that we can use a small strain to modify the energy level structure .",
