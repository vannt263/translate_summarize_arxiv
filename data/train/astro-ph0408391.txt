    "the question of whether there are young galaxies in the local universe forming stars for the first time is of considerable interest for galaxy formation and cosmological studies .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , cold dark matter models predict that low - mass dwarf galaxies could still be forming at the present epoch because they originate from density fluctuations considerably smaller than those giving rise to the giant ones .",
    "thus the existence of young dwarf galaxies in the local universe would put strong constraints on the primordial density fluctuation spectrum .",
    "second , while much progress has been made in finding large populations of galaxies at high ( @xmath7 @xmath8 3 ) redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , truly young galaxies in the process of forming remain elusive in the distant universe .",
    "the spectra of those far - away galaxies generally indicate the presence of a substantial amount of heavy elements , implying previous star formation and metal enrichment . thus it is important to have examples of bona fide young galaxies in the local universe because they can be used as laboratories to study star formation and chemical enrichment processes in environments that are sometimes much more pristine than those in known high - redshift galaxies .",
    "moreover , their proximity allows studies of their structure , metal content , and stellar populations with a sensitivity , precision , and spatial resolution that faint distant high - redshift galaxies do not allow . finally , in the hierarchical model of galaxy formation",
    ", large galaxies result from the merging of smaller structures .",
    "these building - block galaxies are too faint and small to be studied at high redshifts , while we stand a much better chance of understanding them if we can find local examples .",
    "the blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy i  zw  18 is one of the best candidates for being a truly young galaxy .",
    "@xcite described it as a double system of compact galaxies , which are in fact two bright knots of star formation with an angular separation of 58 .",
    "these two star - forming regions are referred to as the brighter northwest ( nw ) and fainter southeast ( se ) components .",
    "they form what we will refer to as the main body ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the presence of ionized gas emission ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and of wolf - rayet stars in the nw component @xcite suggest active ongoing star formation in the main body .",
    "later studies by @xcite and @xcite have revealed a more complex optical morphology .",
    "they pointed out the existence of a prominent diffuse feature @xmath6 22  northwest of the main body , hereafter called the c component ( figure [ fig1 ] ) , which contains a blue irregular star - forming region .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have shown the c component to have a systemic radial velocity equal to that of the ionized gas in the main body , thus establishing its physical association to i  zw  18 .",
    "furthermore , the interferometric h i map of i  zw  18 by @xcite has shown that the c component is embedded in a common h i envelope with the main body .",
    "i  zw  18 remains the most metal - poor bcd and the lowest metallicity star - forming galaxy known since its discovery by @xcite .",
    "later spectroscopic observations by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have confirmed its low metallicity , with an oxygen abundance of only @xmath6 1/50 the solar value .",
    "many studies have focused on the evolutionary state of i  zw  18 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have suggested that it may be a young galaxy , recently undergoing its first burst of star formation .",
    "the latter authors concluded from _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst_)/wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images that the colors of the diffuse unresolved component surrounding the se and nw regions are consistent with a population of b and early a stars , with no evidence for older stars . from color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) studies of the main body based on other",
    "_ hst_/wfpc2 images , @xcite have found that star formation in i  zw  18 began at least 30  50 myr ago and is still continuing to the present .",
    "@xcite have discussed the star formation history in i  zw  18 using the same _ hst_/wfpc2 data as @xcite and @xcite , but going deeper thanks to a more sophisticated treatment of the data . by comparing the observed cmds and luminosity functions with the synthetic ones",
    ", they concluded that there were two episodes of star formation in i  zw  18 .",
    "the first star formation episode occurred @xmath6 0.5  1 gyr ago , as evidenced by the presence of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "this age is more than 10 times larger than the one obtained by @xcite .",
    "the more intense second star formation episode took place between 15 and 20 myr ago .",
    "subsequently , @xcite has carried out a near - infrared ( nir ) cmd study based on _ hst_/near infrared camera and multi object spectrometer ( nicmos ) @xmath9 ( f110w ) and @xmath10 ( f160w ) images .",
    "he concluded that the main body of i  zw  18 is dominated by two populations , a 10  20 myr population of red supergiants ( rsg ) and a considerably older ( 0.1  5 gyr ) population of agb stars .",
    "because of its faintness , the c component has not been studied in as much detail .",
    "its optical spectrum @xcite reveals a blue continuum with weak balmer absorption features and faint h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 in emission , suggesting that the h ii region is ionized by a population of early b stars . in a @xmath13 vs. @xmath0 cmd analysis of the c component ,",
    "@xcite have found a well - defined stellar upper main - sequence ( ms ) of blue stars with ages @xmath6 40 myr .",
    "however , numerous faint red stars are also present , with ages @xmath6 100  300 myr .",
    "those authors concluded that the c component consists of an older stellar population with an age of several hundred myr , but that it has experienced more recently a modest starburst in its southeastern half , as evidenced by the presence of blue stars and h@xmath11 emission . @xcite",
    "have estimated an age for the c component not exceeding 200 myr .    using integrated optical and nir photometric colors derived from ground - based and archival _ hst _ images ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that the age of i  zw  18 as a whole , including both the main body and the c component , does not exceed 500 myr .",
    "this is in agreement with the upper age limits obtained by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but in contradiction with the large one of 5 gyr obtained by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have proposed an extreme scenario in which star formation in i  zw  18 proceeds , not only in recent short episodic bursts , but also in a continuous fashion at a low level over a long period of many gyr .",
    "this would result in an extended underlying low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) red stellar component in i  zw  18 .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have shown that the existence of such a component is supported neither by spectroscopic nor photometric measurements of the extended emission around i  zw  18 .    it is evident that despite considerable work , the debate on the age of i  zw  18 is still not settled .",
    "the evolutionary status of i  zw  18 remains elusive because of several limitations in the preceding work .",
    "previous studies of stellar populations in i  zw  18 based on integrated photometric colors or on spectral synthesis do not provide a unique star formation history .",
    "cmd studies constrain better the star formation history , but until now the available _",
    "images on which these studies are based did not go deep enough below the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) to reveal whether a faint old ( @xmath14 1  2 gyr ) stellar population of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars exists in i  zw  18 or not .",
    "evidently deeper _ hst _ observations were needed .",
    "the installation of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on _ hst _ in 2003 made those deeper observations possible .",
    "we use here new deep _",
    "hst_/acs imaging of i  zw  18 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 to go @xmath6 1  2 mag below the trgb and put more stringent constraints on the state of evolution of the bcd .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in sect .",
    "2 . the lack of a rgb population in the cmd of i  zw  18 is examined in sect .",
    "the distance determination to i  zw  18 is discussed in sect .",
    "cmds of the stellar populations are studied in sect .",
    "we find that i  zw  18 does not contain stars older than @xmath6 500 myr , making it a truly young galaxy .",
    "our results are summarized in sect .",
    "we have obtained _ hst _ images of i  zw  18 during the 2003 may 26  june 6 period in the course of eight visits totaling 25 orbits , with the acs / wide field camera ( wfc ) detector through filters f555w and f814w , which we will refer to hereafter as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0 exposure was obtained during five visits totaling 16 orbits and the @xmath1 exposure during three visits with a total of 9 orbits .",
    "all observations were obtained with the same orientation of the field of view , with one exposure per orbit , split into two subexposures to permit cosmic ray removal .",
    "drizzling was applied so that separate exposures obtained during one visit were slightly offset with respect to one another to permit better spatial sampling .",
    "the total exposure time was 43520s ( @xmath6 12.1 hours ) in @xmath0 and 24300s ( @xmath6 6.8 hours ) in @xmath1 .",
    "the galaxy was positioned on the wfc1 frame , with the scale being 005 per pixel .",
    "preliminary processing of the raw images was done at the space telescope science institute through the standard pipeline .",
    "this resulted in distortion - corrected and drizzled images , six in the @xmath0 band and three in the @xmath1 band , which we used in our subsequent reductions with iraf .",
    "the separate @xmath0 and @xmath1 images were then combined with a coregistration better than 0.1 pixel and cosmic rays removed .",
    "the acs @xmath0 and @xmath1 images of i  zw  18 are shown in figures [ fig1]a  [ fig1]b , rotated so that north is up and east is to the left .",
    "the main body and the c component are labeled in figure [ fig1]b .",
    "their enlarged @xmath0 and @xmath3 views are displayed respectively in figures [ fig2]a  [ fig2]b and figures [ fig2]c  [ fig2]d .",
    "the dark regions in the @xmath3 images correspond to blue colors and the white regions to red colors .",
    "the extended and filamentary dark regions in the main body ( figure [ fig2]b ) represent ionized gas emission from supernova shells , while extended white sources are background red galaxies .",
    "note the presence of several blue stars at large distances from the main body , suggesting recent or ongoing star formation in the halo .",
    "however , the extended halo of red stars , which is a common feature of many dwarf galaxies observed with the _ hst _",
    "( e.g. in ngc 2366 , * ? ? ? * ) , is conspicuous by its absence in i  zw  18 . no appreciable ionized gas emission is seen in the c component ( figures [ fig2]c  [ fig2]d ) despite the presence of many blue stars .",
    "the superior spatial resolution of the _ hst_/acs images permits to resolve individual stars and study stellar populations in i  zw  18 by means of cmds .",
    "thanks to the higher sensitivity of the acs and longer exposure times , our data is considerably deeper than previous _ hst _",
    "observations of i  zw  18 with the wfpc2 .",
    "we used the daophot package in iraf to perform point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting photometry in the sky area shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "thanks to the drizzling procedure , the several bright and relatively isolated stars around the main body and the c component ( figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]c ) allow us to derive reliable and well sampled stellar psfs . we obtain full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the stellar profiles of 2.5 pixels ( 0125 ) and 2.8 pixels ( 0140 ) respectively for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images . as for the aperture radius to use for stellar photometry , we experimented with radii between 2 and 4 pixels to search for the best value giving at the same time a high recovery rate of point sources and small aperture corrections to the derived magnitudes .",
    "we find that the best compromise is an aperture radius of 3 pixel ( 015 ) . with smaller radii",
    "the aperture corrections are too large ( the calibrating aperture radius is 05 ) and introduce unwanted uncertainties in the photometry . with larger radii",
    "the number of recovered stars is sharply reduced , because of the crowding effect which is especially important in the main body .",
    "the background level was measured in an annulus with radii 4 and 6 pixels ( 02 and 03 ) around each source and subtracted .",
    "the zero - points of the photometry are defined as the magnitude of a star which produces a count rate of one electron per second in a given filter and are set so that the star vega has magnitude 0 at all wavelengths .",
    "this gives zero - points of 25.711 mag and 25.487 mag for @xmath0 ( f555w filter ) and @xmath1 ( f814w filter ) respectively .",
    "photometric aperture corrections were obtained by a comparison of psf - fitted magnitudes of 12 bright isolated stars with the magnitudes of the same stars measured with the aperture photometry technique within a 10 pixel ( 05 ) aperture .",
    "we obtained the corrections @xmath15(05 ) ",
    "@xmath16 = 0.18 mag and @xmath17(05 )  @xmath18 = 0.23 mag .",
    "correction for charge - transfer efficiency loss has been carried out according to the prescriptions of @xcite .",
    "we find however , that this effect is negligible ( less than 0.01 mag for sources brighter than 29 mag ) given the high level of the night sky in our long - exposure images .",
    "to check our photometry , we compare the magnitudes of several bright isolated stars in the main body , measured through a large aperture of 10 pixel radius , with those measured using the same aperture in the wfpc2 images of @xcite .",
    "we find that our magnitudes are fainter by 0.05 mag in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "to put our results on the same scale as the wfpc2 data , we have applied that small correction to our data . since",
    "no photometric correction to infinite aperture is yet available for the acs data , we have not considered it . in total , taking into account the aperture corrections and the slight shift between the acs and wfpc2 magnitude scales , the corrections to our psf photometry amount to 0.23 mag in @xmath0 and 0.28 mag in @xmath1 .    to minimize the number of false detections ,",
    "we have adopted the minimum detection level to be 3@xmath19 above the sky noise and a sharpness in the 1.0  + 1.0 range .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the distribution of photometric errors as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes as determined by daophot .",
    "it is seen that errors are about 0.2 mag at @xmath0 = 29 mag and @xmath1 = 28.5 mag .",
    "they increase to about 0.4 mag at @xmath0 = 30 mag and @xmath1 = 29.5 mag .",
    "note that at bright magnitudes ( @xmath20 @xmath4 27 mag ) , the error distribution is very broad at a given brightness because of the effects of crowding , ionized gas emission and a high background level of the unresolved stellar component in the brightest regions of the main body .",
    "the total numbers of recovered stars are respectively 1599 , 3555 and 671 in the @xmath0 image , the @xmath1 image and in both of these images at the same time .",
    "we have adopted a matching radius of 1 pixel , although changing that radius within the range 0.5  2 pixels does not change appreciably the number of stars in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 frames . that more than half the stars are not matched is likely caused by incompleteness effects and an increasing number of false detections at faint magnitudes .",
    "indeed , the number of the stars with @xmath0 = 26  27 mag recovered in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 images is @xmath6 74% that recovered in the @xmath0 image alone , while the number of the stars with @xmath0 = 29  30 mag recovered in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 images is only @xmath6 5% that recovered in the @xmath0 image alone .",
    "the transformation of instrumental magnitudes to the johnson - cousins @xmath21 photometric system as defined by @xcite was performed according to the prescriptions of @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes and colors of point sources were corrected for galactic interstellar extinction adopting @xmath22 = 0.106 mag @xcite .",
    "we have carried out a completeness analysis using the daophot routine addstar .",
    "since the crowding level is more important in the main body than in the c component , the analysis was done for each component separately , in the regions determined by the rectangles in figure [ fig4 ] . for each frame",
    "we have added artificial stars amounting to @xmath6 5% the number of real stars detected inside each rectangle .",
    "we then performed a new photometric reduction using the same procedure as the one applied to the original frame , and checked how many added stars were recovered .",
    "this operation was repeated 10 times for each frame and each magnitude bin and the results were averaged . the completeness factor in each magnitude bin defined as the percentage of recovered artificial stars is shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the completeness is better for the c component because of its lesser crowding : it is about 69% in @xmath0 and 44% in @xmath1 in the 28  29 mag range , but drops to @xmath6 17% and @xmath6 10% in the 29  30 mag range . for the main body ,",
    "the completeness is about 55% in @xmath0 and 39% in @xmath1 in the 28  29 mag range , but drops to @xmath6 10% and @xmath6 5% in the 29  30 mag range .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] displays the combined @xmath1 vs. @xmath3 cmd for the main body and the c component .",
    "the 50% detection limit in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters is shown by a dashed straight line .",
    "our cmd is more than two magnitudes deeper than the cmds obtained earlier for i  zw  18 @xcite . a well populated ms",
    "can be seen at @xmath3 @xmath6 0 mag , which begins with the brightest stars ( @xmath1 @xmath6 23.5 mag ) and goes all the way down to 28.5 mag .",
    "many bright blue loop ( bl ) and rsg stars with @xmath3 @xmath14 0 mag are present in the upper part of the diagram",
    ". two clumps of agb stars with @xmath1 @xmath6 25 mag and @xmath6 26 mag , and with @xmath3 redder than 1.0 mag are detected .",
    "there is , however , a conspicuous lack of a rgb stellar population , despite the fact that our data , depending on the adopted distance to i  zw  18 , goes @xmath6 1  2 mag fainter than the trgb . only a few faint red ( @xmath3 @xmath23 1.3 mag ) sources close to the detectability limit ( @xmath1 @xmath23 26.6 mag ) are present in the combined cmd .",
    "they may be false detections because of their faintness in @xmath0 ( @xmath14 28.5 mag ) .",
    "they may also be real stars with erroneous colors because of the large photometric uncertainties ( see their error bars in figure [ fig5 ] ) and/or with colors reddened by dust .",
    "their possible nature will be discussed in sect .",
    "we have indicated the expected location of the rgb in the cmd by superposing on the data points the isochrone for the very metal - deficient and old globular cluster m15 .",
    "its metallicity [ fe / h ] is 2.17 @xcite , lower than the metallicity of the ionized gas in i  zw  18 .",
    "we have used m15 because it has the lowest metallicity in the @xcite globular cluster sample , and because its isochrone fits well the rgb of the very metal - deficient bcd ugc 4483 ( @xmath2/23 ) @xcite .",
    "isochrones of globular clusters with higher metallicities are too red as compared to the data .",
    "the dotted , dashed and solid lines show respectively , from left to right , the location of the m15 isochrone for three distances of i  zw  18 : 10 mpc , 12.6 mpc and 15 mpc , corresponding to distance moduli @xmath24 = 30 mag , 30.5 mag and 30.88 mag .",
    "the upper extremities of each curve are the locations of the trgb at these respective distances .",
    "it is clear that there is a dearth of sources in the expected region of rgb stars .",
    "this absence is due to a sensitivity effect since it manifests itself at @xmath6 1  2 mag above the 50% completeness line .",
    "only stars detected at levels greater than 3@xmath19 above the sky noise in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are shown in fig .",
    "we have also produced a cmd for i zw 18 where the threshould level is only 1@xmath19 above the sky noise .",
    "examination of that cmd still reveals a lack of rgb stars in i zw 18 , despite the fact that the cmd goes down now 1 mag deeper ( limiting @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes of above @xmath6 30 mag ) .",
    "the cmd of i  zw  18 is thus unique among all cmds of galaxies with resolved stellar populations studied so far with the _ hst_. in those galaxies , the rgb stellar population is invariably present and is many times more populated than the agb stellar population ( see e.g. figure 14 of * ? ? ?",
    "* where the cmds of 11 dwarf irregular and bcd galaxies are presented ) .      to quantify our conclusions about the absence of a rgb stellar population in i zw 18",
    ", we compare the cmd of i zw 18 with that of a nearby galaxy with a well - populated rgb , moved from its actual distance to the one of i zw 18 , so that the data for the comparison galaxy have a resolution and a sensitivity comparable to those of the i zw 18 observations .",
    "the cometary blue compact dwarf galaxy ugc 4483 located at the distance of 3.4@xmath250.2 mpc is an ideal galaxy for such a comparison . with a metallicity of the ionized gas equal to 1/23 that of the sun",
    ", it is one of the bcds with a heavy element content closest to that of i  zw  18 .",
    "it has been resolved into individual stars with _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 observations by @xcite .",
    "the rgb stellar population in ugc 4483 with @xmath26(trgb ) @xmath6 1.3 mag is one of the bluest known among bcds .",
    "its cmd has been analyzed by @xcite and is given in fig .",
    "we discuss in the following how to perform the resampling of the data for ugc 4483 when moving it to the larger distance of i zw 18 .",
    "we need to take into account the fading of stars , the increasing errors of the stellar apparent magnitudes and the increasing crowding effects .",
    "first , we consider how the fading of a star affects the probability of its detection . assuming that ugc 4483 is at the distance of i zw 18 and that it is observed with the acs with the same exposure times in @xmath0 and @xmath1 as for i zw 18 , then the detection probability of a star in the cmd of fig .",
    "[ fig9]c with magnitudes @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath27 where @xmath28(@xmath29 ) and @xmath28(@xmath30 ) denote the incompleteness factors of the acs observations ( table [ tab1 ] ) , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the magnitudes of a star when moved to the distance of i zw 18 .",
    "although the incompleteness factors are different for the main body and the c component , we have used only the incompleteness factors for the latter in our modeling .",
    "this is because the contamination by ionized gas emission in ugc 4483 is more similar to that in the c component than in the main body of i  zw  18 , where it is considerably higher .",
    "next we consider the crowding effect : not all stars that are resolved in ugc 4483 at its distance of 3.4 mpc will be resolved at the distance of i zw 18 .",
    "we assume that this effect is independent of apparent magnitude . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the distribution of distances to the nearest companion of each star in i zw 18 ( a ) and in ugc 4483 ( b and c for the parts of the galaxy imaged respectively by the pc and by the wf2+wf3+wf4 frames , hereafter wf frames ) .",
    "all distances are expressed in acs pixels .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig6]a and [ fig6]b that both stars in a pair are resolved by the acs and the pc only if their separation is more than 3 acs pixels .",
    "the lower separation limits of the acs and the pc are similar because their resolutions are nearly the same . on the other hand , in the wfpc2/wf frames , because of their twice as worse angular resolution , both stars in a pair are recovered only if their separation is more than @xmath6 6 acs pixels . because the linear resolution at a distance of 15 mpc as compared to one of 3.4 mpc is 15/3.4 = 4.4 times worse , of the detected stars in ugc 4483 , only the ones in pairs with separations @xmath14",
    "3@xmath314.4 @xmath32 13 acs will be resolved at the distance of 15 mpc .",
    "the parts of the distributions occupied by the resolved pairs of stars are shown by shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b and [ fig6]c .",
    "they correspond to a fraction of stars of @xmath6 0.06 for the pc frame and of @xmath6 0.51 for the wf frames .",
    "the remaining pairs with smaller separations are not resolved .",
    "we assume that for those , only one of the two stars in a pair is recovered .",
    "this corresponds to a fraction of stars in unresolved pairs of 0.94/2 = 0.47 for the pc frame and of 0.49/2 = 0.25 for the wf frames",
    ".    however , these fractions can be even smaller if there are stars close to the unresolved pairs . to estimate this effect , we consider the distribution of separations between the unresolved pairs of stars and the next nearest star .",
    "we find that only @xmath32 60% of unresolved pairs have a nearest star with a separation @xmath14 13 acs pixels .",
    "we calculate the fraction of the stars @xmath33 which is recovered at the distance of 15 mpc to be : 0.06 + 0.94/2@xmath310.6 @xmath32 0.34 for the pc frame , and 0.51 + 0.49/2@xmath310.6 @xmath32 0.66 for the wf frames . in similar manner",
    ", we derive @xmath33 = 0.39 ( pc ) and 0.76 ( wf ) for the distance of 12.6 mpc and 0.49 ( pc ) and 0.87 ( wf ) for the distance of 10 mpc .",
    "finally , the total probability to recover a detected star in ugc 4483 at the distance of i zw 18 is @xmath34 = @xmath35@xmath31@xmath33 .",
    "we show in fig .",

    "[ fig9]c according to the detection probability @xmath34 for each star .",
    "in addition , we have also recalculated the magnitude of each star by taking into account the errors in the magnitude measurements . for a given stellar magnitude",
    ", we have adopted a 1@xmath19 deviation from a fit to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and distributed the errors in a gaussian fashion .",
    "the apparent magnitude scale for each panel ( left ordinate ) has been adjusted so that the absolute magnitude scale ( right ordinate ) is the same in all panels . in all three panels ,",
    "we also show the isochrone for the globular cluster m15 by a thick line .",
    "the two parallel lines in panels ( b ) and ( c ) delineate the location of rgb stars .",
    "we conclude from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that the rgb of ugc 4483 is clearly visible at all three distances .",
    "even if the rgb is sparser at the distance of 15 mpc , it is still clearly there . in all likelihood , the absence of a rgb in i zw 18 is not the result of a selection effect .",

    "it seen that in both galaxies the numbers of agb stars brighter than the trgb are comparable . however , the numbers of stars fainter than the trgb are much larger in the recalculated cmds of ugc 4483 than in the cmd of i zw 18 .",
    "a kolmogorov- smirnov test shows that , in the 26  28.5 mag magnitude range , the observed distribution of stars in i zw 18 is different at the @xmath23 99% and @xmath6 96% levels from those in ugc 4483 , for distances of 12.6 mpc and 15 mpc respectively . for a distance of 10 mpc ,",
    "the difference in the distributions of stars is at the 99.9% level .",
    "we have chosen a broad region between the two parallel lines for the construction of the histograms shown in fig .",
    "the differences between the histograms of ugc 4483 and that of i zw 18 would be considerably larger if we make that region narrower , and in particular if we exclude from consideration the stars in i zw 18 that are concentrated at the blue edge of the region 0.2  0.3 mag blueward of the m15 isochrone .",
    "there are reasons to think that these blue stars may not be rgb stars .",
    "since the metallicity of the stars in i zw 18 is unlikely to be much lower than the metallicity [ fe / h ] = 2.17 of m15 , their blue colors are likely due to an age effect .",
    "hence these stars are likely considerably younger than the @xmath6 10 gyr old rgb stars in m15 .",
    "furthermore , the distributions of stars in this region are very different in i zw 18 and in ugc 4483 .",
    "the rgb stars in the cmds of ugc 4483 are distributed more uniformly and not in a narrow blue edge as seen in i zw 18 .",
    "there has been some debate about the exact distance of i  zw  18 . values that have been proposed range from @xmath6 10 mpc @xcite assuming the observed heliocentric radial velocity of the galaxy of @xmath6 750 km s@xmath36 is a pure hubble flow velocity and a hubble constant of 75 km s@xmath36 mpc@xmath36 , to @xmath6 12.6 mpc @xcite based on a virgocentric flow model , to @xmath6 15 mpc @xcite based on photometric and spectroscopic properties of i  zw  18 .    with the absence of a rgb stellar population , we can not use the trgb as a distance indicator .",
    "other arguments need to be invoked .",
    "the redshift distance of i  zw  18 without correction for virgocentric infall is 10 mpc .",
    "if this distance is correct , then the @xmath1 magnitude of the trgb would be @xmath6 26 mag , corresponding to the upper extremity of the dotted line in figure [ fig5 ] , i.e. it would appear brighter than some agb stars",
    ". this seems unlikely as agb stars are usually brighter than the trgb .",
    "for example , the agb stars in the bcd vii zw 403 which contains numerous rgb stars are @xmath6 0.5 mag brighter than the trgb @xcite . in another bcd ,",
    "ugc 4483 , the agb stars are brighter than the trgb by @xmath14 0.7 mag @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that a distance of 10 mpc to i  zw  18 is too small .",
    "there is other evidence that goes in the same sense .",
    "@xcite , by correcting the radial velocity of i  zw  18 for virgocentric infall , obtained @xmath37 = 12.6 mpc . @xcite and @xcite suggested that i  zw  18 should be as distant as 15 mpc .",
    "thus , @xcite found that the ionized gas emission seen in the southeastern and central parts of the c component can only be produced by stars with ages less than @xmath6 15 myr or with masses @xmath14 10  15 @xmath38 . at a distance of 10 mpc ,",
    "the absolute luminosities of the brightest stars in the cmd of the c component would not be large enough for such massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , @xcite have compared the cmds of 11 galaxies ( five bcd and irregular galaxies outside the local group and six local group irregular galaxies ) observed with the _ hst _ and found that the absolute magnitudes of the brightest stars in the main body of i  zw  18 would be systematically fainter than those in these galaxies if i  zw  18 is at 10 mpc , which is not plausible . increasing the distance of i  zw  18 to 12.6 mpc",
    "still does not match the observations .",
    "the youngest bright stars in the cmd of the c component would still have too low absolute luminosities and too large ages ( @xmath14 25  30 myr ) to account for the ionized gas in the c component .",
    "we estimate the distance to i  zw  18 by comparing the absolute magnitudes of the agb stars in i  zw  18 with those in other bcds . in figure",
    "[ fig9 ] we compare the cmds of i  zw  18 ( figures [ fig9]a and [ fig9]b ) and the bcd ugc 4483 ( figure [ fig9]c ) .",
    "we consider two distances for i  zw  18 , 12.6 mpc ( figure [ fig9]a ) as proposed by @xcite and 15 mpc as proposed by @xcite and @xcite ( figure [ fig9]b ) . as in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the scales of apparent magnitudes ( left ordinate in each panel ) are adjusted so that the absolute magnitude scale ( right ordinate in each panel ) is the same in all panels .",
    "the thick solid line is the isochrone of the globular cluster m15 , the dashed line in figures [ fig9]a  [ fig9]b shows the 50% completeness limit .",
    "two clumps of agb stars with @xmath1 @xmath6 25 mag and 26 mag are seen in the cmd of i zw 18 . for each cmd , we have derived the mean magnitudes of the agb stars in the shaded regions . in the case of i",
    "zw 18 , this corresponds to the fainter clump .",
    "the short horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] indicate the mean absolute magnitude of agb stars thus obtained .",
    "the absence of rgb stars implies that the agb stars of the fainter clump in i  zw  18 should be at least as bright in absolute magnitude as those in ugc 4483 , since they are descendants of more massive stars .",
    "however , at the distance of 12.6 mpc ( figure [ fig9]a ) the agb stars in i  zw  18 are fainter by 0.25 mag than those in ugc 4483 ( figure [ fig9]c ) .",
    "their absolute magnitudes are similar to those of older agb stars in the bcd vii zw 403 @xcite .",
    "if we increase the distance of i  zw  18 to 15 mpc , then the agb stars in i  zw  18 are 0.13 mag brighter , a much more satisfactory state of affair ( figures [ fig9]b and [ fig9]c ) .",
    "in fact , the agb stars in i  zw  18 and in ugc 4483 have the same absolute magnitudes if the distance to i zw 18 is 14.1 mpc , corresponding to a distance modulus of 30.75 mag .",
    "poor statistics of the agb stars in the cmd of i zw 18 and uncertainties in their real absolute magnitudes preclude a more precise determination of the distance to the bcd .",
    "all we can say is that it is somewhere between 12.6 mpc and 15 mpc , with the most likely value being in the upper range .",
    "our acs data are considerably deeper than all previous imaging of i  zw  18 , obtained with the wfpc2 or nicmos . for comparison ,",
    "the faintest red stars with @xmath1 @xmath6 25 mag and @xmath3 @xmath14 1 mag in the cmd of @xcite ( their figure 7b ) correspond to the brightest agb stars in our cmd ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "likewise , the faintest red stars with @xmath39 @xmath6 7.5 mag ( at the distance of 12.6 mpc ) detected by @xcite correspond to the same brightest agb stars in our data . these agb stars are @xmath6 2.5 mag brighter than the trgb absolute magnitude of @xmath6 5 mag in the @xmath10 band @xcite . furthermore , the acs observations of the c component have two times better spatial resolution as compared to the previous wfpc2 observations ( 005 instead 01 ) .",
    "thus , there is no doubt that our deep images allow to study much fainter stellar populations and put more stringent constraints on the evolutionary state of i  zw  18 .    we have already discussed in section 3 the absence of a rgb stellar population in i  zw  18 .",
    "we now examine the stellar populations that are present .",
    "the cmds for the main body and c component are shown in figures [ fig10]a and [ fig10]b , respectively . the distance of 15 mpc to i  zw  18 is adopted hereafter .",
    "overplotted on the data are geneva theoretical isochrones ( solid lines ) of single stellar populations for a heavy element mass fraction @xmath40 = 0.0004 @xcite , which corresponds to the metallicity of the ionized gas in i  zw  18 . each isochrone is labeled by the logarithm of the age in years .",
    "we choose to use geneva instead of padova isochrones @xcite because the latter are not able to reproduce the isochrone of the globular cluster m2 with a similar metallicity , [ fe / h ] = 1.58 @xcite , while the agreement is better with geneva isochrones .",
    "several star formation episodes in the main body can be inferred from the cmd in figure [ fig10]a and from other observational data . the ongoing star formation with age @xmath6 4 myr",
    "is evidenced by the ionized gas emission ( figures [ fig2]a  [ fig2]b ) and the presence of wr stars in the nw component @xcite , located in two compact clusters @xcite .",
    "the brightest post - ms star in the cmd with an absolute magnitude @xmath41 @xmath6 9.7 mag and an age of @xmath6 5  6 myr is also part of the present burst .",
    "numerous supergiants with @xmath41 @xmath4 8 mag indicate that intense star formation occured @xmath6 10  15 myr ago .",
    "there is evidence for two older star formation events in the cmd .",

    "a second star formation happened @xmath6 300  500 myr ago , which is responsible for the oldest stars in the main body , the agb stars with @xmath41 @xmath6 5 mag .",
    "these age estimates are in agreement with the previous cmd analyses by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , although those authors discussed only one previous star formation episode , because their data did not go as deep as ours and the 300  500 myr old agb stars were not seen .",
    "most importantly , no old agb stars with ages @xmath14 1 gyr are seen , contrary to the assertion of @xcite on the basis of his _ hst_/nicmos cmd .",
    "the presence of such old agb stars would have required numerous rgb stars which are not present in our cmd .",
    "we turn next to the stellar populations in the c component . here , there is no substantial ongoing massive star formation as intense ionized gas emission is not seen .",
    "this is corroborated by the upper part of the cmd , which is nearly devoid of bright stars ( figure [ fig10]b ) .",
    "the lone bright source and the brightest one in the cmd , at @xmath1 @xmath6 22 mag ( shown by a large filled circle in figure [ fig10]b and labeled `` c '' in figure [ fig2]c and figure [ fig10]b ) , is in fact not a single star but represents the central cluster discussed by @xcite . it is partially resolved in our images with a fwhm @xmath6 015 , corresponding to a linear size of @xmath6 10 pc .",

    "ongoing and recent past star formation in the main body is mainly localized in the mii region associated with the se component , and in the miii region associated with the nw component .",

    "however , the absence of ionized gas emission around this cluster @xcite and its relatively red @xmath3 @xmath6 0.35 mag ( figure [ fig11]f ) implies that its age is @xmath14 100 myr .",
    "all previous cmd studies of i  zw  18 did not go deep enough to allow setting an upper limit to its age .",
    "our new deep acs images permit us to do so . for a distance of i",
    "zw 18 in the range between 12.6 mpc and 15 mpc , no rgb stars are seen in our cmds , and the age upper limit can be set to 1  2 gyr .",
    "however , the real age for i  zw  18 is likely smaller as only stars with ages @xmath4 500 myr are present ( figures [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "this age upper limit of @xmath6 500 myr is in excellent agreement with the age estimates obtained by @xcite and @xcite by examining the integrated optical and near - infrared colors of i  zw  18 .    while we favor a distance of i zw 18 in the upper range of the 12.6 mpc ",
    "15 mpc interval , our conclusions will be reenforced if the smaller distance of 12.6 mpc is adopted for the bcd . in this case , it would be easier to detect faint rgb stars since the trgb s apparent magnitude would be up to 0.38 mag brighter ( compare figures [ fig9]a and [ fig9]b with the simulated cmds for ugc 4483 in figures [ fig7]b and [ fig7]c ) .",
    "the ages of the oldest stellar populations will increase at most by a few hundred myr .",
    "however , we have argued in section 4 that such a small distance would not be in agreement with photometric and spectroscopic observations of i  zw  18",

    "we have also included in the last category the progenitors of the agb stars located in the lower right corner of the cmd with 26.4 mag @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath5 27.5 mag and 0.6 mag @xmath5 @xmath3 @xmath5 1.2 mag .",
    "the boundaries of the regions in the cmd of i  zw  18 where these stars are located are shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the spatial distributions of different types of stars are displayed by in figures [ fig12]a  [ fig12]d .",
    "the open circles indicate the locations of the nw and se components in the main body and the central star cluster in the c component .",
    "the spatial distribution of all stars irrespective of type is shown in figure [ fig12]a .",
    "it is seen that the vast majority of the stars are located in the main body and in the c component .",
    "the few scattered points outside i  zw  18 are probably false detections .      in the main body ,",
    "the ms and bl+rsg stars ( figures [ fig12]b  [ fig12]c ) are distributed uniformly , suggesting that ongoing and recent past star formation took place over the whole body . on the other hand ,",
    "the agb stars are mainly located in the southeastern part ( figure [ fig12]d ) .",
    "this was noted earlier by @xcite and @xcite based on wfpc2 images .",
    "the absence of agb stars in the northwestern region may be caused in part by a more severe crowding and a larger contribution of ionized gas emission in the @xmath0 image ( figures [ fig2]a  [ fig2]b ) .",
    "this may make daophot miss more of the agb stars since they are fainter in @xmath0 than the ms and bl+rsg stars .",
    "however , we believe that some of the effect is real .",
    "the most striking feature is that the older agb stars are not more spread out spatially than the younger stars , a fact already noted by @xcite .",
    "such a distribution is drastically different from the situation in other galaxies where the old agb and rgb stars are distributed over a considerably larger area as compared to younger stars , due to diffusion and relaxation processes of stellar ensembles .",
    "if anything , the reverse appears to be true here : the ms and bl+rsg stars are distributed over a larger area around the main body as compared to the agb stars .",
    "this suggests that star formation in the past responsible for the agb stars was more concentrated in the main body , while recent star formation responsible for the ms and bl+rsg stars is more spread out .",
    "evidently , i  zw  18 is a galaxy in the process of forming from the inside out .",
    "the absence of a halo of agb stars and of their progenitors around i  zw  18 , despite an easier detectability at large distances because of less crowding , is in direct contradiction with the scenario of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors have proposed that continuous low - mass star formation has proceeded in i  zw  18 on cosmological time scales in a large area around the main body .",
    "they predict the existence of a red extended underlying stellar component which @xcite claim to have detected from their optical and near - infrared surface photometry , but which was not confirmed by independent photometry by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , the spatial distributions in figure [ fig12 ] suggest that the agb stars in the main body are relatively young and have had no time to migrate to large distances ( cf .",
    "* ) .      in the c component ,",
    "the spatial distributions of the different types of stars are very different from those in the main body .",
    "the ms stars are seen primarily in the southeastern part and are nearly absent in the northwestern part ( figure [ fig12]b ) .",
    "the bl+rsg stars are also mainly distributed in the southeastern part , however their location is offset as compared to the ms stars : the ms stars are mostly aligned in the east - west direction while the bl+rsg stars are mainly distributed in the southeast - northwest direction . on the other hand ,",
    "agb stars are located principally in the northwestern part .",
    "some of these stars are also present to the south of the central cluster .",
    "it appears that the two major episodes of star formation in the c component have occurred in spatially different regions .",
    "this is characteristic of the mode of star formation in bcds where the centers of star formation move about in a stochastic manner .",
    "this also implies that , as for the main body , the formation of the c component is still proceeding .",
    "it started in the northwestern part @xmath6 200  300 myr ago , lasting for a relatively short period , and continues now in the southeastern part .",
    "that ms stars are not seen in the northwestern part does not mean that such stars are not present there .",
    "they are simply too faint to be detected because the ms turn - off for a 200  300 myr old stellar population is @xmath41 @xmath6 1 mag ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or @xmath1 @xmath6 30 mag , below the detectability limit .",
    "the absence of ms stars also means that no detectable star formation has occurred during the last @xmath6 200 myr in the northwestern part .",
    "one possible exception is the nw cluster with the age @xmath14 100 myr . on the other hand , the absence of agb stars in the southeastern region , where ms stars reside ,",
    "suggests that this region is younger , with an age @xmath4 100 myr .",
    "a similar age estimate was made by @xcite from a spectroscopic study .      finally , we consider the spatial distribution and nature of the few faintest ( @xmath1 @xmath23 26.6 mag ) and reddest ( @xmath3 @xmath23 1.3 mag ) sources in the cmd of figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "they are shown by crosses in figure [ fig12]d . a few of these sources are scattered in the field and are likely false detections .",
    "two other are in the c component , while the remaining six are in the southeastern part of the main body .",
    "their @xmath3 colors are redder than those of globular cluster stars in m15 .",
    "the location of some of these sources in the cmd of the main body to the right of the 10 gyr geneva theoretical isochrone with @xmath40 = 0.0004 ( figure [ fig10]a ) implies that they are older than the universe , which is absurd .",
    "the situation is worse when padova isochrones are used .",
    "thus , we conclude that the red colors of the faint sources are not due to their large ages , but to some other reason .",
    "their very red @xmath3 colors may be explained in part by large photometric uncertainties , which at these faint magnitudes , can reach @xmath4 0.5 mag ( see the error bars in figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , these sources may be reddened by dust known to be present in the main body , with a maximum extinction @xmath22 @xmath6 0.5 mag in the southeastern part @xcite . however , this value is derived over large areas , and the extinction can be clumpy and significantly higher on small scales .",
    "it is seen from figure [ fig5 ] that correction for interstellar reddening with @xmath22 @xmath14 1 mag will move all red faint sources in the cmd region where stars with ages @xmath4 500 myr reside . in any case , the faintness of these sources and the unknown distribution of extinction on small scales in the main body and in the c component precludes a more reliable explanation of their nature .",
    "another way to study the properties of stellar populations is to consider their integrated characteristics as given by the surface brightness and color profiles in different regions of the galaxy .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it includes both resolved and unresolved stars .",
    "the disadvantage is that populations with different ages contribute to the integrated light and assumptions have to be made on the star formation history to derive the age distribution of stars .    in figure [ fig13 ]",
    ", we show the @xmath0 ( a ) and @xmath1 ( b ) surface - brightness and @xmath3 ( c ) color distributions averaged over a 7  wide strip along the position angle 47  connecting the main body and the c component .",
    "the origin is taken to be at the center of the nw component of the main body .",
    "surface brightnesses and colors have been transformed to the standard @xmath43 photometric system according to the prescriptions of @xcite and have been corrected for galactic extinction with @xmath22 = 0.106 mag @xcite .",
    "the nw and se components of the main body and the central cluster in the c component are labeled in each panel .",
    "the bluest color @xmath6 0.5 mag is in a region @xmath6 3  northwest of the nw component .",
    "the equivalent width of the h@xmath11 emission line in this region exceeds 1000  @xcite and hence the blue color is due to ionized gas emission .",
    "other regions in the main body with @xmath3 as blue as @xmath6 0.3 - 0.4 mag are also strongly contaminated by ionized gas emission .",
    "the only region in the main body free of ionized gas emission is the southernmost one ( region mi ) which , with @xmath3 @xmath6 0.3  0.4 mag , is the reddest part in i  zw  18 . in the c component ,",
    "the contribution of ionized gas emission is negligible @xcite and the bluest color @xmath3 @xmath6 0 mag in the southeastern part ( region ci ) really reflects that of a young stellar population .",
    "the reddest color @xmath3 @xmath6 0.2  0.3 mag is in the northwestern part of the c component .",
    "it is slightly bluer than the color of the reddest region in the main body , suggesting that the c component may be slightly younger than the main body .",
    "the surface brightness profiles also show the absence of an extended lsb component , with a precipitous drop of 6 mag from the nw component to the edge of the galaxy over a distance @xmath6 10  or 750 pc .",
    "to model the colors of the reddest regions in i  zw  18 , we use spectral energy distributions of single stellar populations with a heavy element mass fraction @xmath40 = 0.0004 , calculated with the pegase.2 code of @xcite .",
    "because geneva stellar evolutionary models @xcite do not include agb stars , the padova models @xcite are used .",
    "the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with a slope @xmath11 = 2.35 , and lower and upper stellar mass limits of 0.1 @xmath38 and 120 @xmath38 respectively are adopted .",
    "the models predict that the @xmath3 color of an instantaneous burst with age between 200 and 500 myr is @xmath6 0.5 mag , or @xmath6 0.1  0.2 mag redder than the observed reddest color . only for an instantaneous burst with age @xmath4 150 myr , several 100 myr smaller than the cmd - derived ages ,",
    "are the modeled colors consistent with the observed ones .",
    "we have also considered the case of continuous star formation . if star formation has occurred at a constant rate continuously during the period 50  160 myr ago , then the @xmath3 color is @xmath6 0.35 mag , in agreement with the observed value .",
    "but the upper age limit is again significantly lower than the cmd - derived ages .",
    "we can increase the upper age limit for continuous star formation to make it consistent with the cmd - derived value of @xmath6 500 myr , but to reproduce @xmath3 @xmath6 0.35 mag , we must at the same time decrease the lower age limit to @xmath6 10 myr . in this case",
    "young massive stars should be present in the reddest regions of i  zw  18 , and they are not seen .    a possible cause for the color discrepancy may be that the metallicity of stars in i  zw  18 is not equal to the metallicity of the ionized gas as assumed , but lower .",
    "we have checked into this possibility with models that are four times as metal - poor ( @xmath40 = 0.0001 ) .",
    "@xmath3 does become bluer , but the blueing is not sufficient . for instantaneous bursts with ages in the range 200  500 myr , @xmath3 @xmath6 0.46 mag , still too red as compared to the observed value .",
    "we have also varied the parameters of the imf for a single stellar population with a heavy element mass fraction @xmath40 = 0.0004 . making the slope flatter or steeper with @xmath11 in the range 2 - 3 and increasing the lower mass limit from 0.1 @xmath38 to 1 @xmath38 does not result in a significantly bluer @xmath3 color .",
    "the @xmath3 colors are in the range 0.45  0.50 mag for instantaneous bursts with ages in the range 200  500 myr .",
    "we conclude from the previous considerations that , despite the uncertainties of the models and the fact that they can not reproduce precisely the observed reddest colors in i  zw  18 , they do predict young ages which are in the ballpark of cmd - derived ages .",
    "we present a photometric study of the resolved stellar populations in i  zw  18 , the most metal - deficient blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy known . the analysis of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of i  zw  18 , based on _ hubble space telescope_/advanced camera for surveys @xmath0 and @xmath1 images , the deepest ever obtained for the bcd , have led us to the following conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "the cmd of i  zw  18 is populated by stars with different ages including the youngest hydrogen core burning main - sequence ( ms ) stars ( age @xmath4 30 myr ) , evolved massive stars with helium core burning [ blue loop ( bl ) stars and red supergiants ( rsg ) ] with ages between 10 myr and 100 myr , and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) helium shell burning stars with ages between 100 myr and 500 myr . however , _",
    "i  zw  18 is the first galaxy with resolved stellar populations where no red giant branch ( rgb ) stars are seen _ , although our data go 1  2 mag deeper than the tip of the rgb for a distance of i zw 18 in the range 12.6 mpc  15 mpc ( see conclusion 2 ) .",
    "the oldest stars located mainly in the southeastern part of the main body and the northwestern part of the c component have an age not exceeding @xmath6 500 myr . thus _",
    "i  zw  18 is a bona fide young galaxy_.    \\2 .",
    "since no rgb stars are seen , we can not use the brightness of the tip of the rgb to derive the distance to i  zw  18 .",
    "instead , we compare the brightness of the agb stars in i  zw  18 with those in the very metal - deficient bcd ugc 4483 with a heavy element abundance of @xmath2/23 to derive a distance in the range 12.6 mpc  15 mpc , with the most likely value in the upper range .    \\3 .",
    "several star formation episodes in i  zw  18 can be inferred from its cmd .",
    "however star formation proceeds differently in the main body and in the c component . in the main body ,",
    "three star formation episodes are indicated , separated by periods of @xmath6 100  200 myr .",
    "examination of the spatial distribution of the stellar populations suggests that the star formation process is still gradually building up the main body from the inside out as the young ms and bl+rsg stars occupy larger areas as compared to the older agb stars . in the c component ,",
    "two star formation episodes are inferred separated by a period of @xmath6 200 myr .",
    "these separate star formation episodes occurred in spatially different regions , reflecting the stochastic mode of star formation in bcds .",
    "the southeastern region of the c component is a few hundred myr younger than the northwestern region .",
    "both in the main body and in the c component , the spatial distributions of the stellar populations in i  zw  18 strongly suggest that the galaxy is still in the process of forming .",
