    "elements in the solar system are formed from a variety of nucleosynthesis processes in stars , such as the slow and rapid neutron - capture processes ( the s - process and r - process respectively ) .",
    "the s - process signature of the solar system abundances can be split into three components ; the weak - component , which involves nuclei with @xmath0 , the main - component , which involves nuclei having atomic mass between @xmath3 , and the strong component , which accounts for the production of the solar @xmath4pb @xcite .",
    "the s - process site is attributed to massive stars for the weak component , and to agb stars having initial mass between 1 and 3@xmath1 at solar - like metallicity for the main component and at low metallicity for the strong component @xcite .",
    "stellar evolution models of massive stars can be used to determine information on the conditions within stellar interiors and calculate the s - process yields relevant for the weak - component .",
    "any changes to the input physics , such as improved laboratory nuclear reaction rates , can affect the evolution of the simulated star and consequently affect the s - process yields .",
    "therefore , different nuclear reaction rates can be tested for their astrophysical impact . in this work",
    ", we will show how variations in the rate of the @xmath2c + @xmath2c reaction affect the evolution of a 25@xmath1 star and the consequential s - process yields of the star .",
    "the motivation for this work originates from nuclear physics experiments and theory ( see for instance spillane et al .",
    "2007 @xcite and gasques et al .",
    "2007 @xcite ) , which are probing low enough energies to investigate the reaction within the gamow window for @xmath2c+@xmath2c fusion .",
    "carbon - core burning occurs at @xmath5 gk .",
    "the dominating reactions are @xmath2c(@xmath2c,@xmath6ne and @xmath2c(@xmath2c , p)@xmath7na which , combined with the efficient @xmath7na(p,@xmath6ne reaction , leaves @xmath8o and @xmath9ne as the dominant isotopes in the core ( the @xmath8o being a remnant from the previous helium burning stage ) .",
    "in addition to core burning , there are typically multiple stages of shell burning later in the evolution of the star , where the number of shells differs depending on the initial mass of the star .",
    "the main neutron source for the s - process in massive stars is @xmath10ne by the reaction @xmath10ne@xmath11n@xmath12 mg .",
    "@xmath10ne is produced in helium burning from the @xmath13n@xmath14f@xmath15o@xmath16ne reaction chain during the supergiant phase .",
    "@xmath10ne is partially burnt at the end of helium burning with a neutron density , @xmath17 @xmath18 ( see , for example , raiteri et al . 1991 @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath10ne left in the co - core is then burnt during carbon - shell burning with higher neutron densities ( @xmath19@xmath18 ) , with the @xmath2c(@xmath2c,@xmath6ne reaction providing the @xmath20 particles @xcite .",
    "the carbon - shell burning is sensitive to the profile of @xmath2c after core - carbon burning , which is in turn sensitive to the still uncertain @xmath2c@xmath21o rate and the choice of convection physics in the models @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "in addition , the yields are sensitive to changes in reactions involving @xmath10ne or its formation @xcite@xcite .",
    "most of the s - process - rich material ejected by the supernova event of a 25@xmath1 star is formed by carbon - shell burning , affecting the weak s - component @xcite@xcite .",
    "stellar models of a 25@xmath1 star with metallicity @xmath22 were generated using the geneva stellar evolution code , with the nuclear network post - processed using the nugrid ppn tool @xcite .",
    "the post - processing was computed using the khaos cluster at keele university .",
    "variations in the carbon burning rate were chosen in relation to the ` standard ' caughlan and fowler rate ( cf88 from now on ) .",
    "models were generated with the cf88 rate ( referred to as model c12s in this work ) , the cf88 rate multiplied by 10 ( c12t10 ) and divided by 10 ( c12d10 ) .",
    "the ratio of the p- and @xmath20-channels was chosen to be 35%:65% @xcite . the additional uncertainty associated with this choice of ratio will be investigated in a forth - coming paper .",
    "models at solar metallicity using different @xmath2c burning rates . here ,",
    "( a ) is model c12t10 , ( b ) is model c12s and ( c ) is model c12d10 .",
    "the shaded regions correspond to convection zones present in the star , with the type of burning indicated by labels . ]",
    "differences in the convective history can be seen in each of the different models .",
    "[ fig : kips ] shows structure evolution diagrams for the models c12t10 , c12s and c12d10 . in each case the convection zones for carbon shell burning at @xmath23(time in years until core collapse ) @xmath24 1 to -2 differ in size and duration . for model c12t10 ,",
    "the duration of the second carbon - shell burning process is much longer and the size of the convection zones is larger .",
    "a large fraction of overlap between the first shell and the second shell is observed and isotopes produced in the first shell by the s - process will be mixed into the second .",
    "the presence of overlapping carbon shells was previously noted by chieffi et .",
    "for model c12d10 , the second carbon - shell burning episode occurs later in time than for the other two models , which is due to the star contracting further before it can reach a temperature high enough so that carbon burning is activated in the shell .",
    "[ fig : ab_c12d10 ] shows the relative abundances of stable isotopes in the second carbon shell of the c12d10 model with respect to the c12s model .",
    "[ fig : ab_c12t10 ] shows the equivalent plot for the c12t10 model with respect to the c12s model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ab_c12d10 ] , a clear signature of a higher neutron density is shown , e.g. higher production of r - only species @xmath25zn , @xmath26ge and lower production of @xmath27sr due to the @xmath28se branching .",
    "the reason is that the star in model c12d10 contracts further , resulting in carbon shells that burn at a higher temperature than the c12s model .",
    "therefore the @xmath10ne neutron source is burned at a higher temperature , increasing the neutron density .",
    "the s - process efficiency is quite similar in model c12s and c12d10 ( see , for example , the similar production of neutron magic isotope @xmath29sr ) . concerning model c12t10 , in fig . [",
    "fig : ab_c12t10 ] , a general increase in the s - process efficiency for isotopes with @xmath0 is shown , compared to model c12s .",
    "the overlap between the first and second convective shells causes the initial distribution of isotopes at the start of the second carbon - shell burning to be affected by the products of the first shell . in the first shell ,",
    "neutrons are also efficiently produced by an additional neutron source , @xmath30o(@xmath20,n)@xmath31ne , where @xmath30o is mostly produced by @xmath8o(p,@xmath32)@xmath30f(@xmath33)@xmath30o .            in this paper",
    ", it has been shown that changes to the carbon burning rate by a factor of 10 in stellar models of a 25@xmath1 star significantly affect the s - process yields .",
    "the overlap of convective carbon shells active at different burning temperatures also has important implications for the s - process yields .",
    "further analysis will be conducted in a forth - coming paper .",
