    "a comet discovered in panstarrs1 @xcite survey data on 2015 dec .",
    "31 @xcite was determined to be the recovery of comet 332p / ikeya - murakami ( previously known as 332p = p/2015 y2 ) , which was discovered in 2010 after a massive outburst @xcite .",
    "follow up observations using megacam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) on 2016 january 1 showed another comet @xmath7 southwest of 332p .",
    "subsequent observations showed the new comet had many pieces and was undergoing a fragmentation .",
    "@xcite suggested that the breakup began in 2010 and that what appeared to be the eastern - most nucleus ( our @xmath8 ) is the primary ; @xcite argued that a new further - east component ( their @xmath9 , our @xmath0 ) contains a translation of iau fragment designations to our @xmath10 identifiers . ]",
    "is the primary .",
    "we obtained data on 12 nights between 1 january and 10 february 2016 , and identified at least 17 fragments , some of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fragimg ] .",
    "the situation is very dynamic with rapid changes in brightness between fragments and new components appearing ( fragment @xmath11 appeared on january 7 ) . both the initial outburst and this multiplicity of nuclei",
    "are observed near perihelion ( true anomaly @xmath12 in 2010 ; @xmath13 here . )",
    "comet splitting may be common , but detailed characterization of a split nucleus is relatively rare .",
    "there have been observations of @xmath14 split comets in the last 150 years , with only a handful well studied @xcite .",
    "splitting is an efficient mass loss mechanism for comets , and is important in their evolution .",
    "two types of splitting are known : ( 1 ) splitting into a few pieces , leaving a surviving nucleus ; and ( 2 ) catastrophic splitting into many sub - km fragments .",
    "various mechanisms ",
    "e.g. , tides , rotation , thermal stress , gas pressure , and impacts  have been proposed for splitting @xcite , but only in the case of comet shoemaker - levy 9 was the mechanism well understood ( tidal break up , @xcite ) .",
    "importantly , the size distribution and composition the ejected material can be related to the internal structure of the comet @xcite .    in this paper , we present photometry and astrometry of these central fragments of 332p , and perform dynamical simulations to examine the time span over which 332p broke up .",
    "we attempt to use the time of the breakup in relation to perihelion to infer the breakup mechanism .",
    "our principal observations were obtained with megacam on the 3.6 m cfht telescope , on 2016 1 january to 13 april ( table [ table : observations ] ) .",
    "the two initial nights used the @xmath15 filter with exposures of 60s and 90s .",
    "subsequent nights were observed in the more sensitive wide - band @xmath16 filter for 120s to 180s .",
    "additionally , we obtained @xmath17-band observations with the uh2.2 m and tek2048 , on ut 16 jan 2015 in the middle of the gap between cfht runs .",

    "no evidence of any fragments is seen in october , but fragment @xmath1 and the @xmath8 through @xmath19 cluster are seen in december . because these are short 45s images on a small 1.8 m telescope , it was necessary to stack four images to see the december ps1 @xmath15-band detections .",
    "the megacam images were bias  subtracted and flattened by the elixir pipeline at cfht .",
    "we fit a world coordinate system ( wcs ) using the astromatic swarp tool @xcite , and used our custom calibration pipeline to give an absolute magnitude calibration using sdss dr8 @xcite . for the @xmath15 filter",
    ", we ignored the minor 1% difference between sdss @xmath15 and megacam @xmath15 .",

    "because the fragments were crowded , diffuse , and ( for @xmath8 and @xmath23 ) overlapping , we applied a simple aperture correction to compute individual magnitudes .",
    "we computed the magnitude of isolated fragment @xmath1 in each image in a large 5  diameter aperture , and used this to correct the magnitude of all measured fragments to a smaller 2  aperture .",
    "additionally , we increased the size of this calibration aperture inversely with geocentric distance , to maintain a constant physical aperture size .",
    "the initially brightest fragment , @xmath1 , had a magnitude of @xmath24 , and the faintest fragment @xmath11 had @xmath25 .",

    "@xmath32 the uncertainties shown by the error bars are computed from the scatter of measurements taken during one night .",
    "it is immediately evident that the brightest fragment @xmath1 is growing fainter as it approaches perihelion , a trend that is followed by @xmath33 , and faint fragment @xmath6 .",
    "however , fragment @xmath0 appears to rise in brightness in the initial @xmath15-band measurements , and @xmath34 and @xmath19 are growing steadily brighter , suggesting that the cloud is evolving rapidly .",
    "most notably , by 30 january , @xmath0 has increased in brightness by two magnitudes , and is clearly the brightest object . on 31 january ,",
    "its @xmath35 is only about one magnitude fainter than the fading value after the 2010 outburst ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) .",
    "in addition to the data in fig .  [",
    "fig : photometry ] , we performed photometry on the 4 december ps1 images .",
    "we measured both fragment @xmath1 and the diffuse assemblage at @xmath8 to have identical magnitudes @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for @xmath1",
    "this magnitude is consistent with the dimming trend seen in the subsequent cfht observations . for @xmath8 ,",
    "this value is roughly consistent with the summed flux of @xmath38 in the cfht observations suggesting little evolution in @xmath1 or @xmath38 from 4 dec .",
    "the surprising result was the complete absence of concentrated fragment @xmath0 in the ps1 4 december image .",
    "the absence of @xmath0 may be consistent with the ongoing brightening as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : photometry ] , but may also arise from the depth limitations of the ps1 data .    in a supplementary table to this paper , we present astrometry and photometry of the fragments in fig .  [",
    "fig : photometry ] extending to 13 april , omitting the low quality ps1 data . the full data set in the supplementary data table shows fragments f1 and f4 brightening slightly , and f2 brightening by @xmath39 mag .",
    "the radial and transverse nongravitational parameters , respectively @xmath40 and @xmath41 , from a symmetric nongravitational force model devised by marsden et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , of component f4 were obtained by hui et al .",
    "( in preparation ) using exorb8[multiblock footnote omitted ] to be @xmath42 au day@xmath3 and @xmath43 au day@xmath3 , taking measurements and astrometry from the minor planet center through ut 2016 april 13 , confirming existence of a nongravitational force .",
    "@xmath44 is consistent with prograde rotation @xcite .",
    "admittedly the nongravitational model may not be perfectly suitable to the case of component f4 , as a small but clear systematic bias trend in astrometric residuals starting from 2016 april 09 is identified by hui et al .",
    "however , taking the complexity of the cascading fragmentation experienced by this comet into consideration , and the short observed arc of the 2016 apparition , we think that the application of the nongravitational model is still meaningful .",
    "we also attempted to prove that component f4 is the primary component , rather than the earliest detected component f1 . if the identification of f4 as the primary is incorrect , we would expect to see a larger rms in the orbital solution compared to a correct linkage . by following the same methods and procedures , we set to establish a linked orbit between observations from 2010 - 2011 and the current observations of component f1 .",
    "the effort turned out to be very successful and the solution quickly converged after only a few iterations .",
    "indeed , the rms of the best fit is even slightly better ( @xmath450.1 ) than that of component f4 , regardless of ballistic or nongravitational solutions .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that the identification of component f4 as the primary of comet 332p is erroneous , because the positional uncertainties of f4 are generally greater than those of f1 , as a consequence of the well - defined morphology of component f1 , and its isolation from any other fragments of 332p .",
    "the separation speeds of fragments split off cometary nuclei are generally found to be @xmath450.1 ",
    "1 m s@xmath46 ( sekanina 1982 ) , which is hard to detect by fitting an impulse from optical astrometric observations alone ( farnocchia , private communication ) .",
    "therefore the successful linkage between the 2010 - 2011 observations and observations of component f1 of the current apparition is not surprising . in order to determine the genetic relationship between components f1 and f4",
    ", alternative dynamic methods will have to be used .",
    "to understand the dynamical properties of the fragments , we make use of the monte carlo model developed in our earlier works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in detail",
    ", our approach creates an ensemble of fragment ejection directions , velocities , and times , and finds those emission events that best match the final observations .",
    "intervals of ejection time that produce a larger number of viable matches with the data are deemed more likely than intervals that produce fewer matches .",
    "the continuing fragmentation of the comet makes it challenging to follow each fragment over an extended period of time , especially for fragments in the debris field surrounding fragment @xmath23 .",
    "hence , we focus on four distinct fragments @xmath1 , @xmath23 , @xmath0 and @xmath6 only .",
    "component @xmath0 is the likely primary as discussed ; fragments @xmath1 and @xmath6 are either very bright or distant from the remainder , allowing robust night - to - night associations ; fragment @xmath23 began as the brightest fragment in the debris field that was unambiguously followed for the longest time span ( 2016 jan . 1 to 8) , making it a good representative of the debris field as a whole .",
    "all other mini fragments in the debris field are extremely diffuse and it is impossible to uniquely track them for more than a few days .",
    "unarguably , all fragments are the descendants from the primary component @xmath0 .",
    "the question is whether all fragments are the _ direct _ descendants of @xmath0 .",
    "it is plausible that the fragments continue to split into smaller fragments as already been hinted by the @xmath8-@xmath23 debris field . for a given fragment , any fragment to its east could be its direct parent , i.e. @xmath6 could be the direct descendant of either @xmath1 , @xmath23 or @xmath0 , and @xmath1 could be directly from either @xmath23 or @xmath0",
    ". however , both @xmath1 and @xmath6 are apparently `` healthy '' fragments while @xmath23 and its immediate companions are only visible intermittently , we feel it is unlikely for @xmath23 ( or its direct progenitor ) to be the parent of either @xmath1 or @xmath6 .",
    "hence , we explore these two scenarios :    1 .   @xmath0 as the parent of @xmath1 , @xmath23 and @xmath6 ; and 2 .   @xmath0 as the parent of @xmath1 and @xmath23 , while @xmath1 as the parent of @xmath6 .    a total of @xmath47 million virtual fragments are released in a 10-day step from the 2010 outburst ( circa .",
    "2010 nov .  1 ) to the recovery in 2016 ( circa .",
    "2016 jan .  1 ) , from the parent component ( either @xmath1 or @xmath0 ) .",
    "the fragments are ejected isotropically at random speeds between 0 and @xmath48 , a range determined by @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the fragments are then mainly determined by solar gravity as well as the net radial force due to anisotropic outgassing of the respective fragment , described by the ratio between the force and solar gravity , @xmath49 ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "we then integrate the fragments to the epoch of 2016 jan .",
    "8.0 tt using the 15th order radau integrator embedded the mercury6 package @xcite , accounting for the gravitational perturbations from the eight major planets ( including the earth - moon barycenter ) , and radiation pressure . at the end",
    ", we compare the modeled _ relative _ positions between the primary and the fragment with the observations , and record the solutions when the observed minus calculated ( @xmath50 ) error is less than @xmath51 ( roughly one fwhm ) .",
    "henceforth , we refer this set of solutions as `` good '' solutions .",
    "the demographics of the `` good '' solutions are shown as figure  [ fig : mc - min ] and  [ fig : mc - best ] .",
    "fragment direction is expressed in the comet s reference frame , with the @xmath52 axis pointing toward the sun , the orthogonal @xmath53 axis aligned in the negative orbit direction , and the @xmath54 axis pointing north from the @xmath55 orbital plane . a fragment s ejection direction perpendicular to an assumed spherical surface is specified by standard spherical longitude @xmath56 and latitude @xmath57 .",
    "that is , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "then @xmath61 points at the sun , @xmath62 points in the negative sense of orbital motion , and @xmath63 points north .",
    "we immediately note that the solutions do not congregate around or shortly after the 2010 outburst , but instead mostly scatter along the comet s outbound journey .",
    "this indicates that the surviving fragments are not immediately produced by the major outburst . for each fragment :    1 .",
    "the separation of @xmath1 from the main nucleus most likely occurred in early 2014 , with an uncertainty of about 6 months .",
    "the median solution is @xmath64 , @xmath65 , split speed @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , representing an emission in the northern hemisphere at the night - side .",
    "the split of fragment @xmath23 is complicated by the fact that @xmath23 is observationally less constrained .",
    "however , we note that most good solutions congregate over recent epochs , within a few months from the recovery in late 2015 , consistent with the fact that fragment @xmath23 is much closer to the primary than fragment @xmath1 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the split between @xmath23 and the primary occur much later than the split between @xmath1 and the primary .",
    "the good solutions are very scattered across the parameter spaces , but do seem to congregate in the nucleus southern hemisphere at the night - side ( i.e. @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) .",
    "3 .   the simulation favors @xmath0 as the direct parent of fragment @xmath6 , as the solution to @xmath1 leaves a large systematic residual .",
    "the split epoch is around late 2011 to early 2012 .",
    "the median good solutions are near @xmath70 , @xmath71 , or in the twilight zone of the southern hemisphere , with a split speed of @xmath72 ) and a @xmath49 of @xmath73",
    ".    in general , our solution agrees with the general conclusion by @xcite , that all the surviving fragments are likely not immediately produced by the 2010 outburst .",
    "further refinement of split parameters is challenging , as the determination is highly sensitive to the quality of the astrometry .",
    "this is especially true for the sub - fragments in the debris field which cross - identification between observations from different night / observatory needs to be done with great care .",
    "initially , fragment @xmath1 was brighter than the nucleus @xmath0 . however , as noted by @xcite , split comet fragment size is often unrelated to dust flux .",
    "the previous far larger outburst of comet 17p / holmes also produced fragments , but these were seen immediately after the event @xcite , in contrast to the 2010 outburst of p/2010 v1 . in both events , a proposed mechanism for the outburst was the runaway exothermic conversion of co - laden amorphous ice to the crystalline form , triggered by a perihelion heat wave from the surface @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the delay in fragment emission from the initial outburst is the result of a smoldering ongoing crystallization process initiated by the 2010 perihelion .",
    "1 of @xcite shows that the crystallization process has a many - year slow - growth phase before accelerating catastrophically , in agreement with the delayed fragmentation we observe .",
    "if such a process hit pockets of co rich ice , or if it propagated into deep reservoirs where it reached a critical temperature of @xmath74 months or years later , it could create a sequence of delayed post - perihelion splitting events .",
    "in contrast to amorphous ice crystallization , the direct sublimation of co or other volatiles , even if they survived at the heliocentric distance of 332p , would be a self - quenching endothermic process .",
    "we performed photometric analysis and dynamical simulations of the central components of fragmented comet 332p .",
    "dynamical arguments indicate that @xmath0 corresponds to the primary fragment , which is within a magnitude of the @xmath26 of the fading post - outburst nucleus in 2011 .",
