    "the present paper is aimed to investigate global static stability of a prestressed axisymmetric collapsible elastic tube conveying a non - newtonian fluid .",
    "the mechanical model under consideration is an axisymmetric variant of plane starling resistor previously discussed in many studies : a flexible thin tube of finite length is mounted from both ends on rigid parts which are subjected to fixed upstream and downstream pressures ( fig .",
    "[ geometry ] ) .",
    "the problem has its origins mainly in studies of blood flow , air expiration from lungs and other biological situations when a media is forced to flow through a compliant channel .",
    "the problem has been investigated from different points of view , the papers @xcite-@xcite are recommended for a review purpose .",
    "the fluid is generally considered as newtonian in the problem of media flow through a collapsible tube .",
    "but it s well known that most biofluids exhibit non - newtonian properties which havent been taken into account ( to the author knowledge ) in any paper concerning stability of the system .",
    "the influence of fluid rheology on local ( twf ) stability has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown how material nonlinearity affects the local properties of elastic wave - like disturbances .",
    "it seems like we are still far from entire understanding of the physical phenomenon even in the case of linear newtonian fluid flow through a collapsible tube but the paper is to shed light to the other aspect of the problem - fluid nonlinearity .",
    "so the study is devoted to developing of a model of power - law fluid flow past a flexible tube and examining its global static stability .",
    "the non - newtonian fluid is assumed to have power - law ( ostwald - de waele ) properties .",
    "the power - law fluid obeys the following constitutive relation : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a pressure , @xmath2 is the unit tensor , @xmath3 is the second invariant of strain rate @xmath4 .",
    "there are two material constants : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the first is a dynamic viscosity and has the dimensions of @xmath7 while the latter , @xmath6 , is a nondimensional parameter which characterizes the physical nonlinearity of the fluid . in case of @xmath8",
    "the media becomes of newtonian type .",
    "also the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and its density is denoted as @xmath9 .",
    "a quasi one - dimensional model of a power - law fluid propagation through a collapsible tube will be proposed in the section . consider an axisymmetric flow past a channel whose boundary can be characterized by the radius @xmath10 of circular cross - section , where @xmath11 is longitudinal coordinate and @xmath12 is the time .",
    "the velocity vector @xmath13 has two nonzero parts with respect to cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "one needs to average the fluid flow over a cross section to obtain a quasi one - dimensional model @xcite .      to average the mechanical system under investigation one should apply some prescribed velocity profile on a cross - section @xmath14",
    "the following approximation ( karman - pohlhausen ) is assumed in this paper : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the volume flux through the cross - section and @xmath17 is a prescribed profile corresponding to poiseuille solution .",
    "the equations of motion and continuity can now be integrated over the arbitrary cross - section @xmath14 applying a profile law ( 2 ) .",
    "one can assume that @xmath18 is a small parameter to obtain a one - dimensional model described only in terms of mean ( with respect to cross section @xmath14 ) parameters :    @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the mean value of pressure .",
    "a description of tube mechanical behaviour is needed to obtain a closed system of equations .",
    "a massless string model @xcite can be used to describe the tube response to fluid pressure .",
    "this model neglects longitudinal displacement of tube due to fluid drag .",
    "in contrast to plane starling resistor the tube cross - section provides an additional stiffness @xmath23 due to a circular shape : @xmath24 where @xmath23 - radial stiffness , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the young s modulus and the poisson s ratio of the tube s material , @xmath27 - undeformed radius of the tube , @xmath28 - the thickness of the tube s wall , @xmath29 - an external pressure and @xmath30 - the force ( per unit perimeter ) of longitudinal tension .",
    "the prescribed upstream @xmath31 and downstream pressure @xmath32 are the boundary conditions of the problem .",
    "the equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are valid through the whole system , while the equation ( 5 ) can be applied only to the compliant region , @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "therefore , it s useful to solve the equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in the upstream ( @xmath34 $ ] ) and downstream ( @xmath35 $ ] ) rigid segments and hence to carry down pressure boundary conditions to an entrance ( @xmath36 ) and an exit ( @xmath37 ) of the collapsible tube @xcite .      generally the external pressure @xmath38 is arbitrary but in the study it will be prescribed in a nontrivial way . applying the same upstream pressure @xmath39 and the downstream pressure @xmath40 to the absolutely rigid starling resistor results in constant pressure gradient @xmath41 and corresponding flux @xmath42 ( hagen - poiseuille law )",
    ". one can set @xmath43 to balance the internal and external to the membrane forces and to have the uniform solution @xmath44 even in the case of compliant properties of collapsible segment .",
    "so the special external pressure applied is a simplification of a general case which is made in order to deal only with uniform reference solution : @xmath45 this reference solution of system of equations ( 3)-(5 ) will be perturbed to explore static stability of the system in the next section .",
    "the statically perturbed solution corresponds to different volume flux @xmath46 , tube shape @xmath47 .",
    "the substitution of this perturbed solution to stationary form of equation ( 3)-(5 ) leads only to one equation : @xmath48    consider a stationary flow with flux @xmath49 through the rigid upstream ( downstream ) segment .",
    "equation  ( 3 ) lead to the well - known relation between the flux and a constant pressure gradient @xmath50 : @xmath51 note that value @xmath52 retains the meaning of pressure gradient only in the rigid segment of starling resistor , and it allows to calculate pressure distribution over the length of the upstream ( downstream ) rigid segment : @xmath53    now the upstream and downstream pressure boundary conditions can be carried down to the collapsible segment ends in order to restrict mathematical region to the segment @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the entrance pressure @xmath55 from the one hand can be expressed as @xmath56 and from the other hand can be obtained from equation ( 5 ) giving the first boundary condition at @xmath36 : @xmath57 the latter is a pinned boundary condition . using the same approach one can find another set of conditions at the exit boundary : @xmath58    the system of equations ( 6)-(8 ) forms an nonlinear boundary value problem having @xmath49 as an eigenvalue and @xmath59 as an eigenfunction .",
    "this boundary value problem will be investigated through all next sections .",
    "let us introduce the nondimensional parameters : @xmath60@xmath61 where @xmath6 is the power - law fluid nondimensional material constant , @xmath62 characterize the system geometry , @xmath63 is a modified reynolds number , @xmath64 is the nondimensional longitudinal force and @xmath65 is the nondimensional radial stiffness .",
    "the dimensional basis \\{@xmath5 , @xmath9 , @xmath27 } is chosen to vary experimental parameters @xmath49 , @xmath30 , @xmath65 independently .",
    "considering only small shell displacements allows to linearize the boundary value problem with respect to a small parameter @xmath66 : @xmath67 @xmath68    @xmath69 @xmath70    the linear boundary value problem ( 10)-(12 ) is of third order and has four boundary conditions .",
    "a condition of the problem solvability defines the neutral surface in nondimensional parameter space on which the nontrivial solution of the system ( 6)-(8 ) can be found .",
    "the general solution of equation ( 10 ) can be found in a following complex form ( except the case of multiple roots ) : @xmath71 where the values @xmath72 are the roots of corresponding characteristic equation . substituting ( 13 ) in ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) gives a forth order linear system with respect to three complex unknown @xmath73 .",
    "one can find an expression for a neutral surface by making the determinant of augmented matrix equal to zero .",
    "numerical analysis of this expression in a space of nondimensional parameters @xmath6 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 will be conducted through the next sections .",
    "neutral surface consists of those points of nondimensional parameter space where nontrivial solution of ( 10)-(12 ) exists .",
    "existence of nontrivial solution means that the reference solution can be statically unstable .",
    "the term `` neutral curve '' applies to two - dimensional cross section of neutral surface when all the parameters are set except for two of them .      for a given values of nondimensional parameter @xmath6 , @xmath74 , @xmath75",
    "there always exists a special case @xmath77 , when the boundary value problem ( 10)-(12 ) has an `` automodel '' solution .",
    "one can see that a variable @xmath78 governs the equation and the boundary conditions in this situation .",
    "hence the expression for neutral surface in nondimensional parameter space can be reduced to single equation on @xmath79 having @xmath6 as parameter .",
    "each solution @xmath80 defines a straight line in ( @xmath81 ,  @xmath82)-subspace which is very useful to compare with as @xmath83 .",
    "relations between @xmath80 and @xmath6 are shown on fig .",
    "[ automodel ] .",
    "numerical investigation shows that there can be no solution @xmath80 for particular values of geometry parameters , for example : @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this corresponds to a collapsible tube without rigid parts but with prescribed pressure on fixed ends . for any @xmath6",
    "the automodel system is statically stable in this case since nontrivial solution @xmath80 of ( 10)-(12 ) can not be found .",
    "physically the `` automodel '' case corresponds to sub- to supercritical flow transition when small amplitude long - wavelength traveling wave flutter appears @xcite ( the value @xmath86 was used there to distinguish sub- from supercritical regime ) .      in this section",
    "the neutral surface will be plotted through two - dimensional cuts by ( @xmath87 ,  @xmath88)-subspace for different values of stiffness @xmath65 and power - law index @xmath6 with other nondimensional parameters being set as follows : @xmath89 for classical penrose tubes parameters @xmath65 is of order of millions and for typical real fluids @xmath90 .",
    "it is also useful to distinguish sub- and supercritical regimes on this plots .",
    "the transition line @xmath91 is horizontal and it corresponds to automodel case discussed above .",
    "the region below the transition line ( @xmath92 ) is subcritical .",
    "note that for higher stiffness @xmath65 all the neutral curves move upwards .",
    "smaller values ( @xmath93 ) which corresponds to pseudoplastic behaviour of the fluid result in considerable defomation of neutral curves .",
    "in this paper the global static stability of axisymmetric starling resistor conveying power - law fluid has been investigated .",
    "the global stability is found to be largely influenced by the physical nonlinearity @xmath6 of the fluid .",
    "the external pressure was chosen to be of special form giving uniform reference solution .",
    "mechanical response of the tube resembles generalised `` string '' model .",
    "the steady equations of motion and incompressibility lead to a boundary value problem which has a nontrivial solution only for specific values of nondimensional parameters .",
    "thus the static instability is associated with nonuniqueness of boundary value problem solution .",
    "the analytical condition of nonuniqueness is investigated numerically for different values of parameters including the automodel case .",
    "the automodel case corresponds to transition from sub- to supercritical regime .",
    "it has been found that the transition is nt always statically unstable .",
    "the neutral curves has been plotted at fig .",
    "[ automodel ] for different geometric parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "increasing of @xmath75 generally leads to neutral curves appearance while sufficient growth of @xmath74 vanishes them .",
    "also one can see how critical values of automodel parameter @xmath94 is affected by nonlinearity : the larger @xmath6 the lower the value @xmath80 .",
    "the transition between regimes is plotted as dashed line in ( t , r)-space for different values of stiffness @xmath65 and power - law index @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ general ] ) .",
    "one can see that static instability can occur for values of @xmath63 lower than @xmath95 which corresponds to transition .",
    "it s worth to point out that increasing of stiffness @xmath65 move upwards all the neutral curves .",
    "decreasing of @xmath6 makes the smallest value of @xmath63 larger when @xmath64 is fixed .",
    "the problem under consideration is treated in very simplified matter .",
    "but since one - dimensional models are believed to capture qualitative properties of starling resistor it s clearly showed that the nonlinearity of the fluid greatly influences the stability condition .",
