    "a characteristic feature of this series of papers including @xcite is that we give a complete answer to special ( but also natural ) word and conjugacy problems for the groups of 2-bridge links , which form a special ( but also important ) family of prime alternating links .",
    "the key tool used in the proofs is small cancellation theory , applied to two - generator and one - relator presentations of @xmath0-bridge link groups .",
