    "current - induced magnetization reversal had attracted considerable interest due to its fundamental significance in understanding interplay between magnetism and electricity as well as potential applications in magnetic memories.@xcite as the scale of the ferromagnetic nanograins goes down to only several nanometers,@xcite many theoretical@xcite and experimental works @xcite were inspired to address the current - induced magnetization reversal in these small structures . by far , most studied setups were multi - layer or nanopillar structures with vertical geometries , in which spins are always carried along the flowing of charge current . usually , the critical current density as high as @xmath0 a/@xmath1 is required to induce a reversal.@xcite considering such high density of current flowing through each nanograin , when a huge amount of nanograins are integrated in large scale , spurious effects such as joule heat , current - induced magnetic field , and noise are not ignorable .",
    "a possible solution is to use pure spin current , in which the same amount of spin - up and -down currents flow along opposite directions , yielding no net electric current . by",
    "far , one of the most promising designs to realize considerable pure spin current is the non - local spin valve ( nlsv ) devices@xcite with lateral geometry.@xcite recently , a nlsv was reported to reversibly switch the magnetization of a ferromagnetic particle.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setupmodel](a ) , a typical nlsv includes a bigger fixed and a smaller free ferromagnets ( denoted by the shadow areas ) embedded on the left and right sides , usually referred as injector and detector , respectively . by driving a current @xmath2 through regions ( 2 ) , ( 1 ) , and ( 3 ) , spins can be injected from injector ( 1 ) to produce a nonequilibrium spin accumulation in nonmagnetic region ( 4 ) .",
    "this spin accumulation exhibits as a splitting of chemical potentials for spin - up and -down electrons ( spin bias or spin voltage ) , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : yang2008_gamma_jle_spinbias](a ) and [ fig : yang2008_gamma_jle_spinbias](b ) .",
    "while the spin - polarized current flows only in the loop formed by regions ( 2 ) , ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , the nonequilibrium spin accumulation in region ( 4 ) diffuses to the right accompanied by a pure spin current flowing toward the detector . in this way , net charge current is prevented from flowing directly into the grain . in the response of @xmath2 , the magnetization of the detector can be read out by measuring the voltage difference @xmath3 between ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , referred to as the nlsv voltage , which is usually estimated by the spin diffusion equation.@xcite by applying @xmath2 exceeding a critical value , the magnetization of the detector can be switched reversibly.@xcite this process is usually described by landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation.@xcite    by far , the detectors are films of size of 100 - 1000 nm . considering commercial charge devices already work well at these scales , the ultimate goal of utilizing pure spin degree of freedom is to replace the charge devices at only several nanometers . besides ,",
    "because the llg equation pre - assume the magnitude and polarization of currents that flow through the grain as input parameters , the counteraction of the detector on the currents is not taken into account . as a result",
    ", important information could be missing , e.g. , whether the pure spin current is still a pure spin current after flowing into the detector .    in this work ,",
    "we study a nlsv device , in which the usual film detector is replaced with one or multiple well - separated cobalt nanograins embedded in insulator , as those in ref . .",
    "the nanograin is much smaller in size ( @xmath4 atoms ) than the films and at much lower temperatures ( @xmath5 mk ) .",
    "such small nanograin can be viewed as a stoner particle whose ferromagnetism comes from the exchange interactions between itinerant electrons inside it , and thereby can be manipulated by exchanging angular momenta with the electrons that tunnel through it.@xcite the grain is modeled as coupled to two non - magnetic leads via quantum tunneling . in one lead ,",
    "the chemical potentials for the spin - up and -down electrons are split , due to the spin injection in the nlsv .",
    "the small size of the nanograin allows us to model the nlsv signal and the magnetization switching within one set of rate equations .",
    "besides , the previous knowledge of the co nanograin from experiments@xcite and theories@xcite allows us to perform a realistic evaluation .",
    "this work focuses on two aspects : ( i ) the possibility of the detection and switching is evaluated using the parameters extracted from the previous nlsv@xcite and co grain@xcite experiments .",
    "( ii ) such small grain is subjected to strong coulomb and magnetic blockades,@xcite how these blockades determine the critical conditions for the reversal , e.g. , the critical driving current @xmath2 , the gate voltage @xmath6 , and the spin bias @xmath7 .",
    "we find that : ( i ) the numerical evaluations using realistic parameters from the recent nlsv@xcite and the cobalt grain experiments@xcite@xcite show that it is possible to employ the nlsv device to detect and switch the magnetization of a ferromagnetic nanograin under the present experimental conditions .",
    "( ii ) under @xmath2 , the nlsv signal can also be detected in the sequential tunneling regime to read out the magnetization of the grain , and interpreted from a microscopic view .",
    "interestingly , if the majority band of the grain is favored to participate in the electron transport , the sign of the nlsv signal turns out to be just opposite to that if the the minority band is preferred to conduct electrons . in the presence of an angle @xmath8 between the easy axis of the grain and the spin - quantization direction of the lead ,",
    "the nlsv signal is proportional to @xmath9 and vanishes when @xmath10 .",
    "( iii ) under @xmath2 exceeding a critical value , the magnetization of the grain can be switched reversibly .",
    "the critical current @xmath2 required for the magnetization switching is determined by the gate voltage @xmath6 and the spin bias @xmath7 at which both the coulomb and magnetic blockades in the grain are lifted . by choosing suitable gate voltage , the critical @xmath7 needed for switching",
    "can be minimized to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the volume - independent anisotropy of the grain . besides",
    ", the transient current during the magnetization reversal may be a spin - polarized current instead of the anticipated pure spin current , due to the electron accumulation or drainage in the floating lead used for the nlsv measurement .",
