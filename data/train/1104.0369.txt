    "the low - energy electronic spectra are linearly dependent on the magnitude of momentum , forming conical valleys , and the dynamics of electrons in graphene can be formulated by dirac equation of massless fermion @xcite .",
    "because of this dirac fermion - like behavior of electrons , graphene may offer an opportunity to test the various predictions of the planar field theories @xcite by experiment with solid state material . in this respect",
    "there have been much effort to connect the two - dimensional ( 2d ) field theory with the graphene physics @xcite , including the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect  @xcite in a ring geometry of graphene  @xcite .",
    "the studies of the ab effect in a graphene ring were mostly concerned about the breaking of time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) that yields a splitting of the valley degeneracy due to the time - reversal symmetry in graphene . in this regard , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the splitting of the degeneracy in a single valley can be controlled by the threaded magnetic flux and a confinement potential of the dirac electrons on the ab ring of graphene .",
    "an interesting result from the work was that the confinement potential , introduced as a mass term in the dirac equation , leads to a breaking of the trs in the absence of the magnetic flux .    in this paper , motivated from the above result , we study the aharonov - bohm - coulomb ( abc ) problem  @xcite in a graphene ring to investigate the effect of a coulomb type potential in the form of @xmath0 on the splitting of valley degeneracy .   within the framework of field theory",
    "there are many possible ways in introducing the potential to the dirac equation .",
    "the only criterion for a consistent coupling of the potential to the dirac equation is the fact that the larger component of the dirac field @xmath1 should satisfy the schrdinger equation @xmath2\\varphi = \\mcl{e}\\varphi$ ] in the non - relativistic galilean limit @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are at least two ways such that the same consistent galilean limit is fulfilled . in the present work we consider the following two possibilities  @xcite :",
    "one is the _ scalar coupling _ and the other is the _ vector coupling_. as we shall describe explicitly in next section , in the former case the @xmath0 potential enters the dirac equation as a mass term , while it enters the equation as an energy term in the latter case . from the viewpoint of time - reversal symmetry the scalar coupling is expected to break the trs , but the vector coupling is not . in the following , we explicitly show that the scalar coupling indeed leads to the splitting of valley degeneracy , while the vector coupling does not .",
    "what is remarkable and new in our result is that , besides the splitting of the single - valley degeneracy , the scalar coupling produces a separation between the energy spectrum of one valley and that of the other valley , and the separation increases with the interaction strength @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , starting with a brief recapitulation of the time - reversal symmetries in graphene , we give a qualitative argument how the trs is broken by the @xmath0 potential in the ab ring of graphene , whereby the splitting of valley degeneracy is produced . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we solve the 2d dirac equation for the scalar coupling of the potential in a graphene ring .",
    "we derive an analytical expression of the energy spectrum in terms of valley parameter ( denoted by @xmath4 ) and the interaction strength @xmath3 .",
    "these two parameters interplay to separate the whole energy spectrum of one valley from the other .",
    "we then compute a persistent current in the ring .",
    "owing to the separation of energy spectra the persistent current is asymmetric about the zero magnetic flux , which represents an essentially single - valley characteristic in the case of scalar coupling , known as the valley polarization  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we present the energy spectrum for the vector coupling . it is shown that , contrary to the scalar coupling case , the potential via vector coupling to the dirac equation alone can break neither the intravalley nor the intervalley degeneracies because of the conservation of the trs .",

    "however , in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , we see that no intervalley splitting exists in the case of vector coupling .",
    "this also confirms that , in the case of vector coupling , the coulomb potential alone does not break the intervalley degeneracy , as explained by the consideration of the time reversal symmetry .",
    "in this paper we have considered the abc problem in a graphene ring with magnetic flux tube and a coulomb type potential @xmath0 at its center .",
    "we have investigated the effects of the potential on the energy spectrum in two different ways : the scalar coupling and the vector coupling . in the scalar coupling",
    "the potential enters the 2d dirac equation as a symmetry - breaking mass term , so that both the intervalley and the intravalley degeneracies are broken .",
    "the main effect of the interaction appears as the separation between the energy spectrum of one valley and that of the other valley , which is attributed to the breaking of the intervalley degeneracy ; for the repulsive interaction the @xmath42 ( @xmath7 ) valley is lifted while the @xmath43 ( @xmath8 ) valley is lowered , and vice versa for the attractive interaction .",
    "contrary to the scalar coupling , the potential in the vector coupling does not break any symmetry and only shifts the ab energy spectrum , indicating essentially the same feature as the energy spectrum without a coulomb potential .",
    "the results obtained here suggests that the scalar coupling of the coulomb type potential @xmath0 can decouple the two valleys because of the considerable lift of energy spectrum , so that each valley degree of freedom becomes an independent quantity , called a valley isospin .",
    "a real experiment with graphene ring may realize this decoupling , known as the valley polarization , which is an important element in the graphene - based electronics , called _ valleytronics _",
    "@xcite .",
    "another interesting issue related to the ab effect is when the thin magnetic flux tube is located at the center of the honeycomb lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "since the anyon is a flux - carrying particle , a similar situation arises when there is an anyon impurity in the graphene plane .",
    "since , in this case , the magnetic flux is located on the graphene , we should treat the singular solution problem , which was extensively discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of the anyonic and cosmic string theories . roughly speaking , there are two prescriptions for the interpretation of the singular solution : one is a mathematically - based prescription called self - adjoint extension and the other is a physically - based prescription .",
    "we do not know yet which prescription is physically more reasonable .",
    "probably , the real experiment with graphene may shed light on the treatment of the singular solution .",
    "if so , our understanding on the anyonic and cosmic string theories can be greatly enhanced through the graphene physics .",
