    "systems producing absorption in the spectra of distant quasars offer an excellent probe of the early universe . at high redshifts , they easily outnumber other observed tracers of cosmic structure , including both normal and active galaxies . mounting evidence that the high column density absorbers are young galaxies links relatively pristine baryonic matter to highly evolved objects at the present day .",

    "the interpretation of quasar absorption systems has undergone something of a revolution during the past two years , with the recognition that they may be gas aggregating into nonlinear structures in hierarchical models like those invoked to account for the observed galaxy distribution ( e.g. , cen 1994 ; petitjean , mucket , & kates 1995 ; zhang , anninos , & norman 1995 ; hernquist et al .   1996 ; miralda - escud et al .",

    "( 1996 ) for the ly@xmath0  forest , the column density distribution predicted by kwhm matches existing data reasonably well , but it falls below the observations by factors @xmath14 and @xmath15 for  and lyman limit absorbers , respectively .",
    "this discrepancy can be attributed at least partly to resolution effects in the simulations .",
    "owing to computational expense , the kwhm simulation could not resolve halos with circular velocities below @xmath16 .",
    "higher resolution simulations of localized regions by quinn , katz , & efstathiou ( 1996 ; hereafter qke ) indicate that halos down to @xmath17  can host damped absorbers , so clearly the number of high column density systems found by kwhm is artificially depressed by the finite resolution of their simulation .    in this paper",
    ", we overcome this numerical limitation using a two - step correction procedure .",
    "first , we employ the press & schechter ( 1974 ) algorithm to correct the kwhm data by extending the halo mass function to values lower than could be resolved by their simulation .",
    "then , we account for absorption by gas in these halos from a relation between the absorption cross section for a halo and its circular velocity .",
    "this relation is established by fitting both the kwhm data and high - resolution simulations that use the qke initial conditions and the kwhm background radiation field .",

    "heating by the uv background prevents the collapse and cooling of gas in smaller halos ( qke ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ) .",
    "the high - resolution volumes are small and were chosen in a non - random way , so they can not be used directly to infer the number of  and lyman limit systems . by convolving the absorption area vs.  circular velocity relation with the halo mass function given by the press - schechter method , we can predict the absorption at any mass scale , effectively extending the dynamic range of the simulations down to the lowest mass objects that produce high column density absorption .",
    "we also present another calculation , similar to that in kwhm but including star formation , to quantify the effects of gas depletion on high column density absorption .",

    "the central region forms a collapsed object that is represented using a large number of low mass particles , while regions further away are modeled using a small number of more massive particles . a simulation of the same volume as qke would require @xmath34 particles of each species to match the resolution of the central region throughout ; the nesting technique allows us to achieve high - resolution locally while preserving the cosmological context of the calculation .",

    "all of the distributions in figure  [ starfig ] show a clear flattening in the column density range @xmath112 .",
    "this flattening reflects the onset of self - shielding . a small range of total hydrogen column densities maps into a wider range of neutral hydrogen column densities because the neutral fraction rises rapidly with column density as self - shielding becomes important .",
    "while the optical depth to lyman limit photons is one at @xmath113 , self - shielding does not become strong until significantly higher column densities because higher frequency photons have a lower ionization cross section and can still penetrate the cloud .",

    "we apply this approach to a number of popular cosmological scenarios in a separate paper ( gardner 1996 ) .",
    "while it is less secure than the resolution - corrected numerical approach of this paper , it is an improvement over existing semi - analytic calculations of  abundances ( e.g. , mo & miralda - escud 1994 ; kauffmann & charlot 1994 ; ma & bertschinger 1994 ; klypin 1995 ) , which usually assume that _ all _ gas within the halo virial radius cools and becomes neutral , and which either assume a form and scale for the collapsed gas distribution or compare to observations only through the atomic gas density parameter @xmath115 , which is sensitive mainly to the very highest column density systems .",
    "our resolution correction increases the incidence of  and lyman limit absorption in the cdm model by about a factor of two , relative to the results of kwhm .",
    "this increase brings the predicted abundance of  absorbers into quite good agreement with observations at @xmath6 and 3 , indicating that the high redshift galaxies that form in the cdm model can account naturally for the observed damped ly@xmath0  absorption . at @xmath52",
    "the predicted @xmath72 is @xmath96 ( a factor 2.4 ) below a recent observational estimate .",
    "however , many of the systems that contribute to this data point have not yet been confirmed by high - resolution spectroscopy , so the estimate may decrease with future observations .",
    "the underprediction of lyman limit absorption in the simulations is more dramatic , nearly a factor of three at @xmath6 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "this discrepancy could represent a failure of the cdm model with our adopted parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , though most of the popular alternatives to standard cdm have less small scale power and therefore fare at least as badly in this regard .",
    "an alternative possibility is that most lyman limit absorption occurs in structures far below the resolution scale of even our high - resolution , individual object simulations .",
    "for example , mo & miralda - escud ( 1996 ) propose that most lyman limit systems are low mass ( @xmath116 ) clouds formed by thermal instabilities in galactic halo gas .",
    "we could also be underestimating lyman limit absorption if some of it arises in partially collapsed structures  sheets or filaments  that are not accounted for by the press - schechter halo formula . while the kwhm simulation includes such structures , it may underestimate their numbers in regions of low background density , where its spatial resolution is degraded , and the qke simulations select high density regions from the outset .",
    "high resolution simulations focused on underdense regions could investigate this possibility . at lower redshifts lyman limit absorption",
    "is always associated with normal galaxies ( steidel 1994 ; lanzetta 1996 ) , but this is not necessarily the case at high redshifts .",
    "in addition to resolution - corrected estimates of @xmath72 , our results provide some insights into the physical nature of  absorbers .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fignzplot ] , roughly half of the absorbers reside in halos with circular velocities greater than @xmath117 and half in halos with @xmath118 .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of metal - line absorption in damped systems ( e.g. , wolfe 1994 ) may be able to test this prediction over the next few years , and future simulations can provide predictions for other cosmological models .",
    "we find that halos with @xmath119 frequently host more than one gas concentration ( figure  [ figvaplot ] ) , so imaging observations might often reveal multiple objects close to the line of sight .    at @xmath10 , star formation and feedback  at least as implemented in our simulations  have virtually no effect on the predicted numbers of lyman limit and  absorbers .",
    "roughly half of the cold , collapsed gas is converted to stars by @xmath6 , but this affects the absorption statistics only at @xmath120 .",
    "depletion of the gas supply by star formation may account for the absence of observed systems with column densities in this range , though the number expected in existing surveys would be small in any case . at lower redshifts , the effects of gas depletion may extend to lower column densities . for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , there are just over a billion years between @xmath52 and @xmath6 , but there are over two billion years between @xmath6 and @xmath121 and over eight billion years from @xmath121 to the present . assuming a roughly constant star formation rate in disk galaxies , most of the depletion of  gas would occur at low redshifts .",
    "ongoing searches for  absorbers are improving the observational constraints on their abundance at high redshift , and follow - up spectroscopic studies of their metal - line absorption and imaging studies of associated ly@xmath0  and continuum emission are beginning to yield important insights into their physical properties .",
    "multi - color searches for `` lyman - break '' galaxies are beginning to reveal the population of `` normal '' high redshift galaxies , which are the likely sources of most  absorption . in the hierarchical clustering framework ,",
    "the abundance , properties , and clustering of these objects depend on the amount of power in the primordial fluctuation spectrum on galactic mass scales , which in turn depends on the nature of dark matter , on the mechanism that produces the fluctuations , and on cosmological parameters such as @xmath106 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "the initial fluctuations on galactic scales are difficult to constrain with local observations because much larger structures ( e.g. , galaxy clusters ) have since collapsed .",
    "the comparison between rapidly improving high redshift data and numerical simulations like those used here opens a new window for testing cosmological models , and we expect that it will take us much further towards understanding the origin of quasar absorbers , high redshift galaxies , and the galaxies that we observe today .    this work was supported in part by the san diego , pittsburgh , and illinois supercomputer centers , the alfred p. sloan foundation , nasa theory grants nagw-2422 , nagw-2523 , nag5 - 2882 , and nag5 - 3111 , nasa hpcc / ess grant nag5 - 2213 , nasa grant nag5 - 1618 , and the nsf under grant asc 93 - 18185 and the presidential faculty fellows program .",

    "<S> lyman limit and damped ly@xmath0  absorption systems probe the distribution of collapsed , cold gas at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations that incorporate gravity and gas dynamics can predict the abundance of such absorbers in cosmological models . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a semi - analytical method to correct the numerical predictions for the contribution of unresolved low mass halos , and we apply this method to the katz ( 1996 ) simulation of the standard cold dark matter model ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) . using this simulation and higher resolution simulations of individual low mass systems , we determine the relation between a halo s circular velocity @xmath5 and its cross section for producing lyman limit or damped ly@xmath0  absorption . </S>",
    "<S> we combine this relation with the press - schechter formula for the abundance of halos  itself calibrated against the simulated halo population  to compute the number of absorbers per unit redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution correction increases the predicted abundances by about a factor of two at @xmath6 , 3 , and 4 , bringing the predicted number of damped ly@xmath0  absorbers into quite good agreement with observations . </S>",
    "<S> roughly half of these systems reside in halos with circular velocities @xmath7 and half in halos with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> halos with @xmath9 typically harbor two or more systems capable of producing damped absorption . </S>",
    "<S> even with the resolution correction , the predicted abundance of lyman limit systems is a factor of three below observational estimates , signifying either a failure of the standard cold dark matter model or a failure of these simulations to resolve most of the systems responsible for lyman limit absorption . by comparing simulations with and without star formation </S>",
    "<S> , we find that depletion of the gas supply by star formation affects absorption line statistics at @xmath10 only for column densities exceeding @xmath11 , even though half of the cold , collapsed gas has been converted to stars by @xmath6 .    </S>",
