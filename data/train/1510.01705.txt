    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     after fixing compensator structure , coefficients @xmath0 are obtained by applying straightforward least squares optimization .",
    "+ we should emphasize here that fitting has to be done for both real and imaginary part of @xmath1 $ ] , thus the actual compensator structure is twice that depicted in figure  [ fig : compensator_structure ] .",
    "+        simulation parameters for system * s * are as follows : symbol rate @xmath2 , carrier frequency @xmath3 , with 64qam input symbol sequence .",
    "nonlinear distortion subsystem * f * of * s * , used in simulation , is defined in , where the delays @xmath4 are given by the vector @xmath5 $ ] , with @xmath6 .",
    "digital simulation of the continuous part of * s * was done by representing continuous signals by their discrete counterparts , obtained by sampling with high sampling rate @xmath7 .",
    "as input to * s * , we assume periodic 64qam symbol sequence , with period @xmath8 .",
    "this period length is used for generating input / output data for fitting coefficients @xmath0 , as well as generating input / output data for performance validation .",
    "+ in figure  [ fig : evm_comparison ] we present evm obtained for different compensator structures , as well as output evm with no compensation , and case with ideal compensator @xmath9 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : evm_comparison ] , compensator fitted using the proposed structure in figure  [ fig : compensator_structure ] outperforms other compensators , and gives output evm almost identical to the ideal compensator .",
    "this result was to be expected , since model in figure  [ fig : compensator_structure ] approximates the original system * s * very closely , and thus is capable of approximating system @xmath10 closely as well .",
    "this is not the case for compensators modeled with simple volterra series , due to inherently long ( or more precisely infinite ) memory introduced by the lti part of * s*. even if we use noncausal volterra series model ( i.e. @xmath11 ) , which is expected to capture true dynamics better , we are still unable to get good fitting of the system * s * , and consequently of the compensator @xmath12 .",
    "+ advantage of the proposed compensator structure is not only in better compensation performance , but also in that it achieves better performance with much more efficient strucuture .",
    "that is , we need far less coefficients in order to represent nonlinear part of the compensator , in both least squares optimization and actual implementation ( table  [ table ] ) . in table",
    "[ table ] we can see a comparison in the number of coefficients between different compensator structures , for nonlinear subsystem parameter value @xmath13 .",
    "data in the first column is number of coefficients ( i.e. basis elements ) needed for general volterra model , i.e. coefficients which are optimized by least squares .",
    "the second column shows actual number of coefficients used to build compensator .",
    "least squares optimization yields many nonzero coefficients , but only subset of those are considered significant and thus used in actual compensator implementation .",
    "coefficient is considered significant if its value falls above a certain treshold @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is chosen such that increase in evm after zeroing nonsignificant coefficients is not larger than 1% of the best achievable evm ( i.e. when all basis elements are used for building compensator ) . from table",
    "[ table ] we can see that for case 3 volterra structure , 10 times more coefficients are needed in order to implement compensator , than in the case of our proposed structure . and",
    "even when such a large number of coefficients is used , its performance is still below the one achieved by this new compensator model .",
    "in this paper , we propose a novel explicit expression of the equivalent baseband model , under assumption that the passband nonlinearity can be described by a volterra series model with the fixed degree and memory depth .",
    "this result suggests a new , non - obvious , analytically motivated structure of digital precompensation of passband nonlinear distortions caused by power amplifiers , in digital communication systems .",
    "it has been shown that the baseband equivalent model can be written as a series connection of a fixed degree and low memory volterra model , and a long memory discrete lti system , called reconstruction filter .",
    "frequency response of the reconstruction filter is shown to be smooth , hence well aproximable by low order polynomials .",
    "parameters of such a model ( and accordingly of the predistorter ) can be obtained by applying simple least squares optimization to the input / output data measured from the system , thus implying low implementation complexity .",
    "state of the art implementations of dpd , have long memory requirements in the nonlinear subsystem , but structure of our baseband equivalent model suggests that the long memory requirements are shifted from the nonlinear part , to the lti part , which consists of fir filters and is easy to implement in digital circuits , giving it advantage of much lower complexity .",
    "we also argued that this baseband model , and its corresponding dpd structure , can be readily extended to ofdm modulation .",
    "simulation results have shown that by using this new dpd structure , significant reduction in nonlinear distortion caused by the rf pa can be achieved , while utilizing full frequency band , and thus effectively using maximal input symbol rate .",
