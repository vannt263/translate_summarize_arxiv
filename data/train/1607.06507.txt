    "quantum technology relies on the utilization of resources , like quantum coherence and entanglement , which allow quantum information and computation processing @xmath1",
    ". however , the quantum entanglement is so fragile and undergoes either an asymptotic decay or a sudden death @xmath2 .",
    "this is due to decoherence , whereby the unavoidable interaction between any real quantum system with its surrounding environment alters the quantum system and consequently disentanglement occurs .",
    "therefore , it is very important to investigate the physical systems and physical effects that may lead to effective long - time entanglement preservation .",
    "although there are so - called decoherence - free states whose initial entanglement is invariant over time , however , only a certain kind of entangled state can be decoupled from the influence of the environment in this way @xmath3 .",
    "so far , a lot of researches have been devoted to entanglement manipulation and protection .",
    "for instance , the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) is a promising way to avoid the decaying behaviour of the entanglement in dissipative systems .",
    "this effect which refers to the inhibition of the temporal evolution of a quantum system by repeated projective measurements during a defined period of time , has been discussed in @xmath4 .",
    "but , this scheme is relatively difficult since one has to perform a series of measurements to the system during the course of the evolution .",
    "the other scheme for protecting the entanglement is detuning modulation that discussed in @xmath5 , which in this approach the quantum entanglement is not preserved in the long - time limit .",
    "another proposed scheme , without the disadvantages of the aforementioned schemes , focuses on the protection of the long time limit of quantum entanglement through the addition of qubits .",
    "the protection of entanglement between two qubits via the additional qubits scheme , was first observed in @xmath6 , where the bipartite entanglement is sustained by the addition of a third qubit . improving the preservation of entanglement by much more additional qubits",
    "was performed in @xmath7 , in such way that all of the entangled qubits and the additional ones were contained in a common environment .    distantly noninteracting",
    "two - level quantum systems each of them interacts with their independent environments are the preferable elements of a quantum hardware in order to accomplish the individual control required for quantum information processing @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , finding strategies to protect quantum resources , such as coherence and entanglement , is an essential task in these configurations @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a system consisting of @xmath10 non - interacting qubits in a common zero - temperature thermal lorentzian reservoir and show how quantum coherence of a given single - qubit in this system can be preserved by increasing the number of additional @xmath11 qubits . at long time limit ( @xmath0 ) , we show that , apart from markovian and non - markovian dynamics , the coherence measure for the single - qubit approaches asymptotically to a non - zero steady value depending on the number of additional qubits and the initial value of qubit coherence .",
    "also , we see that , as @xmath12 , the coherence measure reaches to its initial value .    in the next step , we extend this scheme for protecting bipartite and tripartite entanglements among two and three distant qubits each of them",
    "is contained in independent reservoirs .",
    "it is observed that adding another qubits to each of the reservoirs leads to protecting entanglement from sudden death . at the limit @xmath0",
    ", we obtain simple analytical expressions for each of the bipartite concurrence @xmath13 and tripartite lower bound of concurrence ( lbc ) @xmath14 in terms of number of additional qubits contained in each of the reservoirs and the respective initial state entanglement .",
    "moreover , increasing the number of additional qubits in each of the reservoirs preserves completely the initial entanglement from the dissipative processes in the reservoirs .",
    "as illustrated in the text , this mechanism of entanglement preservation works even for different markovian and non - markovian dynamics occurred individually in each of the related subsystems . after this introduction , in sec .",
    "ii we formulate our scheme for preserving the quantum coherence of a single - qubit . sec .",
    "iii is devoted for extending the scheme proposed in sec ii for protection of bipartite and tripartite entanglements . and",
    "finally , the paper is ended with conclusion in sec .",
    "in this section , we consider an system consisting of @xmath10 independent qubits ( two - level atoms ) immersed in a common zero - temperature thermal reservoir , as depicted in fig .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath15 of the system contains two parts ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 with @xmath18 the free hamiltonian and @xmath19 describing the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath20    @xmath21    where , @xmath22 is the raising ( lowering ) operator of the @xmath23 qubit with transition frequency @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the @xmath27 field mode with frequency @xmath28 .",
    "the strength of coupling between the @xmath23 qubit and the @xmath27 field mode is described by @xmath29 and the dimensionless real constants @xmath30 are introduced to individualize the qubits .    it is convenient to work in the interaction picture where the state @xmath31 of the system obeys the schrodinger equation as @xmath32 and the hamiltonian in this picture is given by @xmath33 since the total hamiltonian commutes with the number of excitations ( i. e. @xmath34=0 $ ] ) , therefore , any initial state of the form @xmath35 evolves after time @xmath36 into the state @xmath37 where @xmath38 , which means all of the qubits are in the ground state @xmath39 except the @xmath23 qubit that is in the excited state @xmath40 and we have @xmath41 ( that is , tensor products of @xmath39 performed @xmath10 times ) .",
    "also , we denote @xmath42 being the vacuum state of the reservoir and @xmath43 the state of it with only one excitation in the @xmath44th field mode .    substituting eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 7 ) to eqs . ( 4 ) ,",
    "gives the probability amplitudes that is governed by a system of @xmath45 differential equations @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath48 , then we have @xmath49 . integrating eqs .",
    "( 9 ) , and substituting it into the eqs .",
    "( 8) , gives the following set of @xmath10 closed integro - differential equation @xmath50 and the correlation function @xmath51 is related to the spectral density @xmath52 of the reservoir by @xmath53 the exact form of @xmath54 thus depends on the particular choice for the spectral density of the reservoir . we take a lorentzian spectral density for the reservoir as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the detuning of @xmath57 and the central frequency of the reservoir that we have assumed to be @xmath24 . the parameter @xmath58 defines the spectral width of the coupling and the parameter @xmath59 is the coupling constant . by using the spectral density @xmath52 given by eqs .",
    "( 12 ) , we can then obtain the exact solutions by laplace transform @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 . here , there are two regimes for the system environment coupling ; weak coupling regime ( @xmath63 ) and strong coupling regime ( @xmath64 ) . in the weak coupling regime",
    "the behaviour of the system is markovian and irreversible decay occurs .",
    "however , in the strong coupling regime non - markovian dynamics occurs accompanied by an oscillatory reversible decay . after tracing out the zero - temperature thermal reservoir and",
    "the qubits except @xmath23 one , the reduced density matrix of the @xmath23 qubit in the basis @xmath65 , at time @xmath36 , becomes @xmath66 furthermore , if we let @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 , eqs .",
    "( 13 ) reduces to @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the reduced density matrix of the @xmath23 qubit in eqs . ( 14 ) , can be rewritten as @xmath74 the @xmath23 qubit dynamics thus depends only on the function @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , which depends on the spectral density and the number of qubits .",
    "also , as discussed in @xmath77 , by differentiating of eqs .",
    "( 17 ) with respect to time and comparing it with an exact master equation , decay rate of the @xmath23 qubit can be obtained as @xmath78    baumgratz @xmath79 introduced an intuitive measure of quantum coherence based on the off - diagonal elements of density matrix of the desired quantum state @xmath80 , as @xmath81 where @xmath82 are the off - diagonal elements of the system density matrix .",
    "indeed , it has been recently shown that @xmath83 satisfies the physical requirements which make it a proper coherence measure .",
    "suppose the @xmath23 qubit is initially prepared in the state @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , the other qubits are prepared in the state @xmath39 and the reservoir is in its respective vacuum state , so in this way , @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , at time @xmath87 , the coherence of the @xmath23 qubit becomes @xmath88 .",
    "the dynamics of coherence as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath89 is shown in fig .",
    "2 , where we have assumed that @xmath90 . in fig .",
    "2 ( a , b ) , the coherence measure of the qubit exhibits a markovian dynamics with an asymptotical decay in the absence of additional qubits ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "however , it is readily observed that it can be greatly inhibited by increasing the number of additional qubits ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "moreover , in the non - markovian regime and in the absence of additional qubits ( @xmath91 ) , the measure of coherence oscillatory undergoes to sudden death and in the presence of additional qubits ( @xmath92 ) , undergoes to a non - zero steady value , as depicted in fig .",
    "2(c , d ) .",
    "the oscillations of coherence in the non - markovian regime constitute a sufficient condition to signify the presence of memory effects in the system dynamics , being due to information backflow from the environment to the system .",
    "we point out that , in contrast to the markovian regime , the existence of detuning ( @xmath56 ) tend to slow down the decay process of the coherence in the non - markovian regime .",
    "it should be noted that , in the long time limit , the measure of coherence reduces to the following expression @xmath93 indeed , the qubit coherency can be determined only by knowing the number of additional @xmath11 qubits in the reservoir and the initial state of the qubit .",
    "also , as @xmath94 , @xmath95 reaches to @xmath96 , i.e. to the initial coherency of the @xmath23 qubit . on the other hand ,",
    "these observations are confirmed by the behavior of the related decay rate ( 18 ) in terms of the scaled parameter @xmath89 , as shown in fig .",
    "to achieve our scheme of entanglement preservation , we consider a composite system consisting of two subsystems @xmath97 and @xmath98 contained in two independent lorenzian reservoirs .",
    "each of the subsystems has @xmath99 and @xmath100 qubits respectively .",
    "let s consider the @xmath23 qubit of subsystem @xmath97 and the @xmath101 qubit of subsystem @xmath98 prepared initially in an epr - type entangled state as follows @xmath102 as depicted in fig . 1 ( b ) . according to the ref .",
    "@xmath103 , the complete dynamics of the above two - qubit system can be obtained easily ( see appendix ) . therefore , in the standard computational basis set such as @xmath104 , the explicit forms of the matrix elements of above two - qubit density operator at time @xmath36 becomes @xmath105 where @xmath106 are similar to the eqs .",
    "the parameter @xmath107 defines the spectral width of the coupling of the qubits of subsystem @xmath97 ( subsystem @xmath98 ) to its respective reservoir .",
    "we assume that the coupling constants of the qubits to their respective reservoirs are equal , i.e. @xmath108 .    to quantify amount of entanglement of the state ( 22 ) , we use concurrence as a measure of two - qubit entanglement .",
    "the following analytical closed form for the concurrence is obtained @xmath109 the time dependency of the concurrence has been shown in fig . 4 in the markovian and non - markovian regimes .",
    "notice that in the case of @xmath110 ( in the absence of additional qubits in the subsystems a , b ) , the concurrence ultimately decays into zero but there is a steady non - zero value for it by increasing @xmath99 and @xmath100 in both the markovian and non - markovian regimes .",
    "an interesting result for the concurrence occurs at the asymptotical limit @xmath111 , as follows @xmath112 indeed , in the long time limit , the concurrence can be determined only by knowing the number of qubits in the reservoirs and the initial conditions of the two - qubit system .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath113 and @xmath114 or @xmath115 and @xmath116 , or each of them equal to one , then the concurrence decays into zero in the long time limit . on the other hand , as @xmath117",
    ", the concurrence approaches to its initial value ( 2@xmath118 ) .",
    "also , if we let , for instance , @xmath119 and rename @xmath120 then the eqs . ( 24 ) becomes @xmath121 the concurrence evolution in ( 23 ) can be evaluated under different non - markovian behaviors of the related subsystems as shown in fig . 5 with @xmath122 .",
    "at the long time limit , it is interesting to note that , apart from different non - markovian natures of the subsystems , the asymptotic concurrences are completely coincided to each others .      in this section ,",
    "we extend the results of the previous section to three subsystems @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath123 each of them contained in three independent lorenzian reservoirs .",

    "the matrix elements of the three - qubit density operator at time @xmath36 are    @xmath129    and zero for the remained ones and @xmath106 and @xmath130 are similar to the eqs .",
    "the parameter @xmath131 ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) is the spectral width of the coupling of @xmath99 ( @xmath100 and @xmath124 ) qubits to its respective reservior .",
    "also , we assume that the coupling constants of the subsystems to their respective reservoirs are equal @xmath134 .    to assess entanglement analytically the so - called lower bound of concurrence ( lbc ) can be used .",
    "any separable states have a vanishing lbc but its inverse is not true .",
    "however , a positive lbc detects entanglement with certainty yet .",
    "thus , use of lbc for the tendency of entanglement dynamics is acceptable . according to ref .",
    "@xmath135 , the lbc of a three qubit mixed state @xmath136 is defined by @xmath137 ^ 2+[c_{r}^{(23|1)}(\\rho)]^2+[c_{r}^{(31|2)}(\\rho)]^2\\}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 where @xmath139 are the eigenvalues , in decreasing order , of the matrix @xmath140 , @xmath141 the six generators of group @xmath142 acting on qubits @xmath143 and @xmath144 the y - component pauli matrix acting on qubit @xmath145 . for the density matrix of our concern , its lbc can be obtained as @xmath146 fig .",
    "6 , shows the lbc in markovian and non - markovian regimes .",
    "notice that similar to the previous section , in the case of @xmath147 ( without the presence of additional qubits in the subsystems a , b and c ) , the lbc eventually decays to zero but there is a steady value for lbc being retained by increasing @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath124 in both markovian and non - markovian regimes . in the limit @xmath111 , the lbc reduces to @xmath148 consider , for example , @xmath149 then the lbc in ( 31 ) becomes @xmath150 and in the same way , if @xmath115 and @xmath149 , then lbc is equal to zero",

    "explicit dependence of the coherence measure , bipartite and tripartite concurrences on the number of additional qubits have been derived .",
