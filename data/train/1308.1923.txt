    "the main goal of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is to create and study new states of nuclear matter .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are able to reach collisional energies high enough to create the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , a new state of nuclear matter in which the quarks and gluons are the relevant degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "one of the most surprising discoveries made at rhic and later confirmed at the lhc is that the qgp seems to behave as a nearly ideal fluid , with one of the smallest values for the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio , @xmath0 , ever observed in nature @xcite .    in the last two years , rhic started to investigate collisions at lower energies , the so - called rhic low energy scan , in order to probe the phase diagram of nuclear matter at large baryon chemical potentials and to study the existence of a critical point @xcite .",
    "a striking discovery made by the low energy scan program was that the differential elliptic flow of charged hadrons , @xmath1 , does not change considerably as one goes to lower collisional energy @xcite .",
    "this came as a surprise since the large values of @xmath1 observed at rhic s highest energy were taken as the main evidence for the  almost \" ideal fluid nature of the qgp @xcite .",
    "the fact that such a high differential flow coefficient is also observed at smaller collisional energies , in which the qgp is only present during a very small fraction of the total lifetime of the system , may suggest that the hadron gas formed at the end of the collision can also exhibit strong collective flow .",
    "several calculations shen:2012vn , auvinen:2013qia , plumari:2013bga , solanki:2012ne based on fluid - dynamical and/or transport models performed at lower rhic energies have tried to understand how such large differential elliptic flow can occur even at these energies . however , at nonzero baryon chemical potential , the uncertainties in the equation of state and in the transport coefficients , and the existence of baryon stopping in the initial stages render such a task more complicated .",
    "recently , it was shown that the dissipative effects on @xmath1 at rhic s top energy originate mostly from the viscosity of the qgp around the ( pseudo ) phase transition and the viscosity of the hadron gas formed afterwards @xcite .",
    "as one goes to higher energies , @xmath1 becomes more sensitive to the viscosity of the qgp phase ( which is expected to increase with temperature ) , while if one goes to smaller energies , this observable becomes more and more sensitive to the viscosity of the hadron gas ( which is expected to increase with decreasing temperature ) .",
    "since @xmath2 increases with decreasing temperature in the hadron gas phase , one would naively expect @xmath1 to become considerably smaller as the initial collisional energy of the system is reduced .",
    "note that the aforementioned behavior of @xmath0 as a function of energy was only estimated for nuclear systems at zero baryon chemical potential @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand how this is modified in the presence of a finite baryon chemical potential , @xmath3 .",
    "previous works already indicate that the @xmath0 of a gas is reduced at finite chemical potential @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath0 was computed for a pion - nucleon gas in ref .",
    "japonese using the chapman - enskog formalism @xcite and it was shown to be reduced when @xmath4 .",
    "the exception is in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath0 of a hadron resonance gas was estimated in the excluded volume hadron gas model using a simplified _ ansatz _ for the shear viscosity coefficient . in that work",
    "the result obtained was that @xmath0 is increased when the baryon chemical potential is nonzero .    on the other hand , it is important to state here that the fluidity of a system at finite chemical potential can not be inferred by the smallness of @xmath5 , as was argued in ref .",
    "a more realistic measure of fluidity would be the ratio of shear viscosity over the enthalpy multiplied by the temperature , @xmath6 .",
    "note that , when the chemical potential is zero , this quantity reduces to the ratio between shear viscosity and entropy density . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath7 is large @xmath8 considerably differs from @xmath0 , which can make a difference when analyzing how well a certain system flows ( the same can be said for systems that are chemically frozen ) .    in this work ,",
    "we compute the shear viscosity of a hadron resonance gas at nonzero temperature and baryon chemical potential using chapman - enskog theory @xcite within a simple hadronic model @xcite .",
    "we then compute @xmath6 for this system and show that it is considerably reduced when the baryon chemical potential is nonzero .",
    "for the values of baryon chemical potential expected to occur around the ( chemical freeze - out ) phase transition of qcd andronic:2008gu , andronic:2005yp , cleymans:1998fq , cleymans:1999st , cleymans:2005xv , noronhahostler:2009tz , this reduction is shown to be particularly large .",
    "this result suggests that the baryon rich hadron gas formed in the intermediate energies obtained at rhic , and at future facilities such as fair @xcite , can display strong collective flow , as already implied by the flow harmonic data obtained at rhic .    in this work",
    "the metric tensor is @xmath9 and natural units are employed , @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , we limit our discussion to boltzmann gases .",
    "we start by generalizing the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the retarded green s function associated with the shear - stress tensor for the case of a dilute multi - component system . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this formalism will give the same answer as the chapman - enskog expansion @xcite for the linear coefficients of the burnett theory @xcite , i.e. , the gradient expansion .",
    "we perform our calculations in the local rest frame of the fluid where @xmath11 .",
    "since we restrict our discussion to shear viscosity , we may consider the simplified scenario in which the fluid does not accelerate , @xmath12 , nor expands , @xmath13 , and the temperature , @xmath14 , and chemical potential , @xmath15 , do not vary in space and time .",
    "here , @xmath16 , where @xmath7 is the baryon chemical potential and @xmath17 is the baryon number of the @xmath18th hadron species . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we only consider classical statistics .",
    "after these simplifications , the boltzmann equation linearized around a classical equilibrium state , @xmath19 , becomes @xcite@xmath20where @xmath21 is the energy of the particle , @xmath22 is the number of hadron species considered , @xmath23 is the spatial derivative , and @xmath24 is the shear tensor .",
    "we defined @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the doubly symmetric , traceless projection operator .",
    "also , we introduced the linearized collision operator , @xmath30,@xmath31here , @xmath32 $ ] is the lorentz - invariant measure , @xmath33 is the degeneracy factor of the @xmath18th hadron species , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the corresponding transition rate , with @xmath36 being the differential cross section and @xmath37 the mandelstan variable .    using eqs .",
    "( [ linearboltzmann ] ) and ( [ collisionterm ] ) , we express the fourier transform of the shear - stress tensor , @xmath38 , in terms of the fourier transform of the shear tensor , @xmath39 , in the traditional form of linear response @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the green s function has the following structure@xmath41where @xmath42 and we used the definition of the total shear - stress tensor of a multi - component system@xmath43    our goal is to compute the above retarded green s function and its derivatives at vanishing wavenumber",
    ". this will be enough to determine the relevant transport coefficients of linearized relativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "following the strategy outlined in @xcite , we start by introducing the irreducible second rank tensor @xmath44 , which satisfies the following integro - differential equation,@xmath45 in general , @xmath46 is a function of @xmath47 but , as mentioned above , we shall only need it at vanishing wavenumber , @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath49 and its dependence on @xmath50 can be described by the following expansion , @xmath51substituting eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ oh_man ] ) , it follows that @xmath52where we used @xcite @xmath53then , the linear relation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be cast into a more convenient form , @xmath56 , where we introduced the retarded green s function@xmath57    equations such as ( [ equation ] ) appear quite often in problems involving the extraction of transport coefficients from the boltzmann equation .",

    "<S> we investigate the effects of finite baryon chemical potential on the transport properties of a hadron resonance gas . we find that a hadron resonance gas with large baryon number density is closer to the ideal fluid limit than the corresponding gas with zero baryon number . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the system created at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at lower collision energies may behave as a fluid , with an effective fluidity close to the one found at rhic s highest energy near phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this might explain why the differential elliptic flow coefficient measured at lower collisional energies at rhic is similar to the one observed at high energies . </S>"
