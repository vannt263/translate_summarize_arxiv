    "experimentally , the existence of such bound states is indicated in the finuda measurements @xcite of the stopped @xmath1 absorption on li , c and other target nuclei .",
    "these experiments using the finuda spectrometer installed at the da@xmath10ne collider detect a @xmath3 hyperon and a proton pair in coincidence following @xmath1 absorption at rest on several nuclei .",
    "the emitted @xmath3-@xmath2 pair is found to emerge , predominantly back to back in all target nuclei , and have their invariant mass distributions peaking significantly below the sum of a kaon and two proton mass in free state ( 2.370 gev ) . if it is assumed that the @xmath3-@xmath2 pair is emitted from a ",
    "@xmath5 \" system in the nucleus , this mass shift implies a bound @xmath5 system in nuclei with the binding energy above 100 mev . in a more elaborate second run of these experiments",
    "carried out recently @xcite it is further reported that these mass shifts occur only for the @xmath5 module , and not for the @xmath11 cluster .",
    "the absorption on an @xmath12 pair gives @xmath3-@xmath13 and @xmath14-@xmath2 pairs in the final state .",
    "recent analysis of the old disto data from the saturne accelerator on @xmath15 reaction too suggests the existence of a @xmath5 cluster with the binding energy around 100 mev @xcite .    theoretically , following the extraordinary success of the su(3 ) chiral perturbation theories in describing the @xmath16-@xmath17 and @xmath18-@xmath17 systems , the @xmath1-@xmath2 system has also been studied under this framework , though , unlike pion and @xmath18 cases , the basic interaction here is relatively strong .",
    "this , however , is incorporated in these studies by including terms up to order @xmath19 in the chiral lagrangian expansion .",
    "then , in combination with non - perturbative coupled - channel techniques this framework has been found quite appropriate for the study of antikaon - nucleon interaction in the literature .",
    "it was first developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently expanded in ref .",
    "various channels involved for s = @xmath201 meson - baryon scattering are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath9 , @xmath25 . with the proper choice of parameters entering in these calculations ,",
    "all available low - energy scattering data in these channels are reproduced well .",
    "the @xmath9 scattering amplitude resulting from these calculations have a two pole structure between @xmath26 and @xmath27 thresholds . the pole which is located close to the real axis couples strongly to the @xmath27 channel , while the one coupling strongly to @xmath28 channel lies away from the real axis .",
    "empirically , only available information pertaining to @xmath9 scattering below threshold is the @xmath26 invariant mass distribution .",
    "this mass spectrum has its maximum at 1405 mev , and has a width of about 50 mev . in the particle data group table",
    "@xcite this is identified as t = 0 , spin half , s = @xmath201 @xmath29 @xmath9 bound state with a binding energy of 27 mev .",
    "however , it is noticed in the literature that there is some subtlety involved in assigning a mass to the @xmath29 .",
    "the observed @xmath26 spectrum has t = 0 .",
    "hence , in principle , it can have a generic s - wave t = 0 source .",
    "this means that one needs to fit a superposition of the contributions from both , the @xmath27 and @xmath30 poles mentioned above , to reproduce the observed @xmath30 spectrum and assign a mass to @xmath29 . within this scenario",
    "it turns out that both the poles contribute roughly in equal measure to reproduce the measured @xmath26 spectrum , with a tendency towards higher @xmath27 share .",
    "a more thorough investigation of this issue has been carried out recently in ref .",
    "they conclude that for the study of @xmath27 scattering , amongst various channels involved in the coupled channel calculations , the @xmath27 and @xmath26 channels dominate and they couple strongly .",
    "they also conclude that the mass of the @xmath29 state is in fact 1420 mev , and not 1405 mev , thus making it only 12 mev below @xmath27 threshold .",
    "recent measurements on the @xmath31 reaction at cosy @xcite , however , seem to present experimental evidence which do not support the above two pole model for the @xmath29 .",
    "the shape and position of the @xmath29 distribution in these measurements is reconstructed cleanly in the @xmath32 channel using invariant- and missing - mass techniques .",
    "the mass of the @xmath29 is found to be @xmath33 1400 mev and width @xmath33 60 mev .",
    "theoretical search for the antikaon - nucleus bound state has been carried out in the literature following the variational approach @xcite and the faddeev method @xcite for @xmath1 plus 2 - 3 nucleons and heavier nuclei .",
    "all these calculations need , as input , realistic choice for the @xmath34 and the @xmath1-@xmath17 potentials . for the nucleon - nucleon potential , following extensive work over the years on this subject , it is always possible to make a correct choice . for the @xmath1-@xmath17 potential , however , the situation is uncertain .",
    "some calculations generated a pseudo - potential for it by reproducing the @xmath1-@xmath2 bound state of 27 mev binding energy , while others used a leading order chiral interaction .",
    "they all found @xmath5 bound states with about 50 mev or more binding energies .",
    "latest calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite , which , following the two pole model , uses the @xmath1-@xmath17 effective potential corresponding to 1420 mev mass of @xmath29 , finds a @xmath5 system bound by around 19 mev only .",
    "this state has a width between 40 and 70 mev .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath5 module might not be sufficiently bound to produce any experimentally observable signal corresponding to the antikaon - nucleus mesic bound state .",
    "the situation is further confused by the suggestion in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the down - shift observed in the invariant mass of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the finuda experiment could be the result of the final state interaction of these particles with the recoiling nucleus .",
    "this seems quite plausible because , due to q - value of the @xmath35 reaction being around 317 mev , the kinetic energies of outgoing @xmath2 and @xmath3 are 160 mev or so . at these energies",
    ", it is well known that in the nucleon - nucleus scattering the reactive cross section mainly consists of the single nucleon knock - out channel @xcite .",
    "thus , the knock - out of one nucleon in the nucleus by the out going @xmath2 or @xmath3 can shift their energies considerably .",
    "the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite indeed reproduce the observed mass shifts in the finuda experiments .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the similar effects not observed in run ( 2 ) of finuda in @xmath1-@xmath36 absorption can not be reconciled with this explanation @xcite .    therefore",
    ", the situation on the ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) reaction in the nucleus seems very confusing .",
    "it calls for more studies on the description of the reaction dynamics , as well as the @xmath1-nuclear binding .    in the present paper",
    "we reexamine the hypothesis of magas _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite of the origin of the observed @xmath3-@xmath2 peak in the finuda measurements to the single nucleon knock - out events in the final state .",
    "the calculations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are the computer simulations of the internuclear cascade model for the nucleon - nucleus scattering .",
    "this approach describes the sequence of nucleon - nucleon collisions of the outgoing nucleon while passing through the residual nucleus in the final state in the framework of classical physics .",
    "the trajectory of each nucleon is followed .",
    "after a mean free path a @xmath17-@xmath17 collision takes place and its results are computed by monte carlo or some similar method .",
    "apart from the pauli principle there are no quantum mechanical effects in this approach of describing the fsi .",
    "the nucleus too is described by the fermi gas model , thus being totally devoid of any nuclear structure effect . in view of the crucial role played by the fsi in interpreting the finuda @xmath3-@xmath2 measurements for @xmath1-nuclear bound states ,",
    "it is absolutely necessary that the fsi in this reaction is described using quantum mechanical scattering theory and nuclear wave functions .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , first , based on physical reasoning , we present an overall description of the @xmath37 reaction following @xmath1 absorption in the nucleus along with an appropriate final state interaction .",
    "this is followed by the formalism utilized for the evaluation of the cross section .",
    "calculated results along with a discussion around them are presented for @xmath4c target nucleus .",
    "this is followed by the conclusions .    to remain specific in our discussion and presentation , in the following we consider @xmath4c target nucleus all along .",
    "the @xmath1 meson after being captured in a high atomic orbit reaches the @xmath38 orbit through electromagnetic transitions .",
    "from there onward it comes under the influence of the strong nuclear interaction and gets absorbed .",
    "the x - ray transition width for the @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 transition and the nuclear capture from the @xmath38 orbit are reported in @xcite to be 0.0749 ev and 0.98 @xmath41 0.19 ev respectively .",
    "this gives the relative population of kaons in @xmath40 and @xmath38 orbits , using @xmath42 around 7@xmath43 .",
    "such a small population of kaons in the @xmath40 orbit also makes nuclear capture of kaons from the @xmath44 orbit as insignificant .",
    "we , thus , consider in our calculations the capture of the kaon from both the @xmath38 and @xmath40 atomic orbits .",
    "the @xmath1 absorption yield for the @xmath45 branch is written as the weighted average yield from these orbits as @xmath46 however , as we will see later ( fig .",
    "1 ) , due to larger centrifugal barrier , the overlap of the @xmath38 orbit with the nuclear wave functions is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the @xmath40 orbit . furthermore ,",
    "as the calculation of the absorption yield , @xmath47 involves the square of this overlap , despite the factor of 0.07 in the above for the @xmath40 orbit , the contribution from the @xmath38 orbit to the @xmath1 nuclear capture remains about two orders of magnitude smaller than that from the @xmath40 orbit .",
    "therefore , in the following we present calculations considering the capture from the @xmath40 orbit only .    in the absorption process , the @xmath3 hyperons in the final state are produced either in the quasi - free process @xmath48 or the two - nucleon absorption process @xmath49 .",
    "for the measurements which involve @xmath2-@xmath3 detection in coincidence , obviously only the two - nucleon absorption contributes . the absorption on more than two nucleons is expected to be weak",
    "because the probability of finding three or more nucleons together in the nucleus is small .",
    "the q - value of the @xmath50 process ( ignoring nuclear binding of the absorbing protons ) is 317 mev .",
    "this energy is mainly shared by the emerging nucleon and the @xmath3 hyperon .",
    "furthermore , since the fermi momentum of the nucleons in the nucleus is not large , the outgoing nucleon and the @xmath3 hyperon following @xmath1-absorption at rest emerge back to back and have their momenta centred around 570 mev / c .",
    "of course , due to fermi motion , in an actual situation the back to back correlation is smeared into two narrow cones , and momenta of the nucleon and the @xmath3 are spread around 570 mev / c by the fermi motion .",
    "additionally , the target nucleus , after absorption , is left into a two hole shell model state .",
    "structurally , two aspects of nucleon motion in the nucleus appear in the @xmath51 absorption process in the nucleus .",
    "because of the predominantly back to back emission of @xmath2 and @xmath3 hyperon and their momenta being centred around 570 mev / c , the absorbing pair of nucleons in the nucleus needs to be as close as around 0.2 fm to each other at the time of @xmath1 absorption .",
    "since the @xmath17-@xmath17 potential at these distances is very strong , the relative wave function of these protons has strong short range correlations .",
    "these correlations in the nucleus , however , heals very fast @xcite and the wave function goes over to the shell model mean field wave function .",
    "the centre of mass of these two protons , however , has no such constraints on it , hence , it always moves in the most probable trajectory given by the nuclear mean field .",
    "the appropriate 2-proton wave function in the nucleus for the kaon absorption , therefore , has the form , @xmath52 where @xmath53 s are the shell model wave functions and @xmath54 is a jastrow - type correlation function @xcite .",
    "the outgoing @xmath2 and @xmath3 will also be correlated similarly by a correlation function , say @xmath55 .",
    "the healed @xmath2-@xmath3 wave function here , however , will be a phase shifted wave function .",
    "consequent to the above completely two different space scales involved , the absorption probability for @xmath1 in the nucleus for the @xmath2-@xmath3 branch ( for absorption on a @xmath56 pair , say ) factors into two parts ( shown in the next section ) , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the centre - of - mass and the total momenta of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . @xmath60 and @xmath61 are respectively the absorption strength for @xmath62 process in their centre of mass and the momentum probability distribution of nuclear wave functions corresponding to the total momentum , @xmath63 . because of the back - to - back emission of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , obviously the magnitude of @xmath64 is very large and that of @xmath63 is small . due to",
    "these vastly different momentum scales for @xmath64 and @xmath63 , over most of the variables measured in the @xmath51 reaction , while @xmath65 can go through a large variation , the factor @xmath66 does not change much .       showing the localization of the @xmath1 absorption for the @xmath40 and @xmath38 orbits .",
    "the vertical line shows the @xmath67 radius of the @xmath4c nucleus .",
    "( b ) distribution of the @xmath40 and the @xmath38 @xmath1 wave functions.,width=604,height=264 ]    before we talk about the final state interaction ( fsi ) , let us mention that the @xmath1 absorption in the nucleus occurs on its surface .",
    "quantitatively , this region is determined by the overlap of the @xmath1 @xmath40 and @xmath38 atomic orbits with the spatial distribution of the absorbing protons .",
    "1a shows these overlaps , where @xmath68 for the @xmath4c nucleus we have taken the two protons moving in the @xmath69 shell model orbital .",
    "their radial distribution is described by the harmonic oscillator wave function .",
    "the kaonic atomic orbits are given by the hydrogenic wave function .",
    "to show their relative localization clearly , in fig .",
    "1a we plot @xmath70 s for the @xmath40 and the @xmath38 @xmath1 orbits , which have different magnitudes , on the same scale with arbitrary units .",
    "we see that both the overlap functions peak around r = 2.5 fm , with @xmath38 overlap function about half a fermi ahead .",
    "the @xmath4c rms radius is known to be 2.4 fm .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath38 overlap function , we note is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the @xmath40 orbit .",
    "this happens because the @xmath38 wave function rises slower than the @xmath40 @xmath1 wave function in the region of the overlap , as we see in fig .",
    "above localization of the @xmath70 beyond the @xmath4c rms radius coupled with the back to back emission of @xmath2 and @xmath3 following absorption , suggests that only one of the two emitted particles , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , goes into the nucleus at a time .",
    "the other particle moves outward .",
    "hence , the fsi with the recoiling nucleus is mainly suffered by only one particle , @xmath2 or @xmath3 at a time .",
    "the channels which dominate in contribution to this interaction are the elastic channel and the single nucleon knock - out ( ko ) channel .",
    "the latter is known to constitute about 80@xmath43 of the total reactive cross section in the proton - nucleus inelastic scattering in nuclei around 160 mev proton energy @xcite , which is the relevant proton energy in the present study . out of these , the effect of the elastic channel at intermediate energies is mostly absorptive , while that of the ko channel is dispersive as well as absorptive . in our calculations ,",
    "we include both the channels .",
    "the inclusive probability for a process like @xmath71 is therefore written as @xmath72 the sum of two terms in the above is incoherent because in principle ( by making exclusive measurements ) we can distinguish between elastic scattering and single scattering with one target nucleon being knocked out .",

    "4 - 5 ) between the calculated results from vertex i and the corresponding finuda measurements .        to get a quantitative idea about the extent of deflection the vertex ii may introduce in the proton , @xmath263 , in fig .",
    "8 we show its angular distribution relative to the @xmath169 motion after being scattered from the vertex ii . initially the @xmath264 is taken to move at 180@xmath257 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath3 with energy as fixed at the vertex i , including the spread due to fermi motion . without the knock - out scattering",
    ", this distribution will be just a point at cos(@xmath265)=@xmath201 in this figure .",
    "due to scattering this point gets a significant spread , as we see in this figure .",
    "calculated results use eq .",
    "( 54 ) and are integrated over the energy spread of @xmath263 .",
    "mass distribution from both the vertices along with the experimental points @xcite.,width=415,height=377 ]    the consequence of above is expected to be a significant modification in the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath2 and @xmath169 . however , before we show these results we may mention that , because of various sums , integrals and constrain checks on kinematic variables , the calculations are very involved and tedious . therefore , to keep the calculations somewhat simpler and physically transparent we have put some constraints in the calculations without , of course , losing any essence of the physics of the results .",
    "we have seen earlier in the calculations on vertex i that the @xmath2 and @xmath169 from it emerge mainly back - to - back with a very small cone angle .",
    "we have , therefore , done the vertex ii calculations with @xmath265 = 180@xmath184 only .",
    "the energy variation of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 due to fermi motion of the absorbing protons in the nucleus a , however , has been kept intact . with this , in fig .",
    "9 we show the calculated invariant mass distribution of @xmath2-@xmath3 after knock - out scattering along with the finuda measurements @xcite . it is extraordinary to see that the calculated mass distribution totally agrees with the measured ones . they agree in mass shift as well as in the shape of the distribution .",
    "this is the same observation as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , to get the complete @xmath2-@xmath169 invariant mass distribution we need to add to above the contribution from the  elastic scattering \" fsi corresponding to vertex i ( fig .",
    "therefore , in fig .",
    "9 we also show the @xmath2-@xmath3 invariant mass distribution due to vertex i , and the sum of the ",
    "elastic \" and  knock - out \" contributions .",
    "the summed distribution obviously has two peaks , one corresponding to  elastic scattering \" fsi and another to the  single nucleon knock - out \" fsi .",
    "this is similar to the inclusive inelastic spectrum normally seen experimentally in ( @xmath2 , @xmath263 ) or ( @xmath7 , @xmath266 ) scattering on any nucleus at  intermediate energies \" @xcite .",
    "unusual thing following @xmath1 absorption seen here is that the peak corresponding to  elastic scattering \" seems to be missing in the finuda data .",
    "this is intriguing .",
    "we summarize our observations for the vertex ii as ,    1 .",
    "the calculated invariant @xmath2-@xmath3 mass distribution totally reproduces the experimentally observed distribution .",
    "this is in line with the finding in ref .",
    "though we have not shown the full calculations for the inclusive energy spectra for the proton or lambda and angular correlation between them , we believe that due to large deflection and energy shift by the single - nucleon knock - out scattering the agreement seen in figs .",
    "4 - 5 between the observed and calculated angular correlation between the @xmath2 and @xmath169 and the inclusive @xmath2 and @xmath169 energy spectra using only the vertex i will be spoiled considerably .",
    "we have not calculated these spectra fully because , due to several integrations over various kinematic variables , they are very long and involved .",
    "we have calculated the inclusive differential absorption probability for @xmath1 at rest in @xmath4c nucleus for the @xmath0 exit channel .",
    "the @xmath1 is assumed to be absorbed on a pair of protons in the nucleus .",
    "the final state interaction in the reaction includes the elastic scattering of @xmath2 and @xmath169 in the final state and the single nucleon knock - out from the recoiling nucleus .",
    "the calculated invariant @xmath2-@xmath3 mass distribution shows two peaks , one due to elastic scattering and another due to knock - out channel .",
    "the latter peak overlaps in position and width with the peak observed in the finuda measurements .",
    "the peak corresponding to elastic scattering is not seen in the experiments .    measured angular correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath169 and their inclusive energy distribution agree with the corresponding calculated results including only the elastic scattering in the final state .",
    "inclusion of the knock - out channel is likely to spoil this distribution .",
    "thus , finally , we may conclude that , seen in isolation , the experimentally observed shift in the invariant @xmath2-@xmath3 mass distribution could be interpreted as due to single nucleon knock - out final state interaction .",
    "but , if we include other results , like the absence of elastic scattering peak in experiments , full agreement of the calculated @xmath2-@xmath169 angular correlation and their inclusive spectra using only vertex i with the corresponding measurements , the situation becomes quite a bit confusing .",
    "as a final comment in the present work on the  @xmath200 \" cluster interpretation of the observed downshift of about 100 mev in the finuda measurements of the @xmath267 invariant mass compared to its free value , the knock - out reaction in the final state seems to be a definitive alternative for this shift .",
    "only discomfiture in this conclusion comes from the absence of the  elastic scattering \" peak ( fig .",
    "9 ) in the observed invariant mass distribution in the finuda measurements .",
    "this absence can not be attributed to the cut off of the @xmath3 hyperons below 300 mev / c momentum in the finuda spectrometer as these momenta in the ",
    "elastic scattering \" peak are above 400 mev / c .",
    "availability of absolute measurements may help to understand the ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) reaction better .",
