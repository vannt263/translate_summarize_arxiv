    "few - body quantum physics with ultracold atoms has emerged as a new research field , connecting basic concepts from nuclear , molecular , and atomic physics @xcite .",
    "the paradigm of the field is efimov s prediction of universal three - body states @xcite .",
    "efimov showed that , when two bosons interact with an infinite scattering length , the corresponding three - particle system has an infinite number of three - body states just below threshold .",
    "signatures of efimov states were first observed in an ultracold gas of cesium atoms @xcite , and have since been found in many other ultracold systems , including other bosonic gases @xcite , three - component fermionic spin mixtures @xcite , and mixtures of atomic species @xcite .",
    "very recently , the existence of an efimov state has also been confirmed for helium atoms in a molecular beam @xcite .",
    "moreover , extensions of the efimov scenario to universal states of larger clusters @xcite have been demonstrated in experiments @xcite , highlighting the general nature of universal few - body physics .",
    "the universal regime of few - body physics is realized when the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 is well separated from all other length scales of the problem .",
    "this means that @xmath1 has to be large compared with the relevant range of the two - body interaction potential , but small compared with the thermal de broglie wavelength of the sample .",
    "thus , the conceptually most simple case is the idealized scenario of a zero - range two - body interaction in a zero - temperature ensemble .",
    "this case , which has been widely discussed in the literature , is commonly referred to as the `` universal limit '' of few - body physics , where all observables are uniquely connected by fixed relations @xcite .",
    "many experiments have focused on tests of these universal relations , concerning the famous efimov period @xcite , the relation between features at positive and negative scattering lengths @xcite , and the relation between three - body and @xmath2-body resonances @xcite . some of the experiments @xcite have revealed deviations from perfect universality , which challenge our understanding of the intricate connections between the idealized few - body scenario and systems that exist in the real world .",
    "efimov resonances in three - body loss @xcite represent the main observables in few - body physics with ultracold atoms .",
    "they mark the points where the three - atom states cross the dissociation threshold .",
    "the finite temperature of the ensemble shifts those resonances as the efimov state then couples to the scattering continuum , and the feature turns into a triatomic continuum resonance @xcite .",
    "the limitations by unitarity @xcite lead to a saturation of the maximum resonance amplitude , and the resulting effect is a blurring with a loss of visibility @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even when an experimental observation is strongly influenced by the finite temperature , an appropriate theoretical model allows one to extract the zero - temperature position of an efimov resonance .",
    "knowledge of this position also determines the three - body parameter ( 3bp ) @xcite , which fixes the ladder of efimov states .    in our recent work on cesium @xcite ,",
    "we have observed and analyzed an _ excited - state _ efimov resonance . such higher - order resonances are , under realistic experimental conditions , always strongly influenced by the temperature .",
    "we have employed the theoretical model of ref .",
    "@xcite to extract the resonance position for the zero - temperature limit .",
    "the theoretical approach is based on an @xmath3-matrix formalism and provides a non - perturbative solution for any temperature under the basic assumption of a two - body interaction with a zero range .",
    "we thus refer to it as the universal zero - range ( uzr ) model .",
    "an extension of the theory has been applied in ref .",

    "this reveals a temperature - dependent resonance shift that corresponds to a variation of the 3bp with the collision energy . for a real atomic system",
    ", we introduce the length that is associated with the van der waals attraction and characterize the shift in an empirical way based on length scale arguments .",

    "the shaded region indicates the temperature range explored in our cs experiments , which extends from 9  nk to 3.2  @xmath8k , corresponding to @xmath9 from @xmath10 to @xmath11.,width=321 ]    different regimes in experiments on efimov states can be discussed in terms of length scales .",
    "figure  [ fig : lengthscales ] illustrates the situation for the cs atom .",
    "the shortest relevant length scale is the van der waals length @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 is the atomic mass and @xmath14 is the van der waals coefficient .",
    "this length quantifies the long - range part of the two - body interatomic potential , and for cs @xmath15 with @xmath16 denoting bohr s radius .",
    "the efimov ground - state is characterized by the parameter @xmath17 , which specifies the scattering length at which an efimov state crosses the dissociation threshold .",
    "this parameter , which corresponds to the 3bp in the zero - energy limit , also characterizes the typical size of the efimov ground state .",
    "recent work has revealed a new kind of ` 3bp universality ' @xcite , which is specific to atomic systems and links this parameter to the van der waals length by @xmath18 .",
    "the first excited efimov state is characterized by the analogously defined resonance position @xmath19 .    to tune the scattering length in cs ,",
    "a broad feshbach resonance near 800 g serves as an excellent tool @xcite .",
    "this resonance represents the most extreme case of an entrance - channel dominated resonance @xcite that is known for any species . here",
    "the scattering problem can be described in terms of an effective single - channel model , neglecting the intrinsic two - channel nature of a feshbach resonance . for this resonance ,",
    "the length parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 have been determined @xcite , corresponding to an efimov period of @xmath22 .",
    "the first observation of an efimov resonance in cs @xcite was made at low magnetic fields near 7.5 g , where a feshbach resonance of similar character exists .",
    "here @xmath23 was found , which is very close to the observation on the high - field resonance .",
    "we now introduce the thermal length scale @xmath7 , where @xmath24 is the thermal de broglie wavenumber .",
    "experiments on cs have been carried in a temperature range between @xmath25nk @xcite and 3.2@xmath8k .",
    "for the lowest temperature , @xmath26nk , the length @xmath27 is right between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this means that the ground - state efimov resonance will show very little temperature effects since the dimensionless parameter @xmath30 is quite small , which indeed was the case in the experiments reported in refs .",
    "in contrast , the excited - state efimov resonance will be strongly dominated by finite - temperature effects since @xmath31 is rather large , which was the case in the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite . in an intermediate experimental temperature regime , with @xmath32nk one obtains @xmath33 , which means that also the ground - state efimov resonance will be subject to substantial temperature effects .",
    "this intermediate regime was already investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at the highest experimental temperatures of @xmath34k ( this work ) we realize @xmath35 , so that strongly temperature - dominated behavior of the ground - state resonance can be expected , quite similar to the excited - state efimov resonance at 9nk .",
    "however , in this regime , an additional complication arises as even the smallest dimensionless parameter in the problem , @xmath36 , is no longer small .",
    "this suggests the appearance of a combined effect of finite temperature and finite range .",
    "in this section , we present our experimental results for the temperature dependence of the ground - state efimov resonance that appears in cs near a magnetic field of 853  g  @xcite . for an accurate conversion of the magnetic field to the scattering length",
    "we employ the model of ref .  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ ssect : exp ] , we describe our experimental methods . in sec .",
    "[ ssect : exp_fits ] , we present detailed measurements of the three - body loss rate coefficient @xmath37 , which are then compared and analyzed with the uzr model . in sec .",
    "[ ssect : finitetcorr ] , we present an empirical description of a small temperature - dependent shift of the resonance position as determined within the uzr approach .      our experimental setup and the procedures for preparing an ultracold cesium sample are similar to the ones reported in refs .",
    "here we use a single laser beam instead of two crossed laser beams to form an optical dipole trap , which contains the atoms in the lowest hyperfine and zeeman sublevel @xmath38 .",
    "the near - infrared trapping beam with a waist of 40 @xmath8 m is provided by a fiber laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm . along the axial direction",
    "the trapping potential is mainly provided by the curvature of the magnetic field .",
    "a magnetic levitation gradient of @xmath39  g / cm is applied to compensate the gravitational force . to prepare atoms at various temperatures , we vary the trap depth at which the evaporation is stopped .",
    "an increase in trap depth of typically 50% is applied adiabatically at the end of the evaporation to avoid unwanted evaporative losses during the hold time . by varying the final power of the trapping light between 1.2 and 260 mw , we can set the temperature in a range between about 30  nk and 3  @xmath8k . for the shallowest trap ,",
    "the trap frequencies are @xmath40[19.0(2 ) , 20.8(7 ) , 1.46(1 ) ] hz , where the last one is the axial frequency . for the deepest trap , the trap frequencies are @xmath40[296(1 ) , 359(3 ) , 2.21(2 ) ] hz .",
    "correspondingly , the geometric mean frequency @xmath41 varies between 8.3(1 )  hz and 61.7(3 )  hz .",
    "the typical atom numbers after the preparation procedure are about @xmath42 for our lowest @xmath43 and @xmath44 for our highest @xmath43 .",
    "the three - body recombination rate coefficient @xmath37 is obtained from the decay curves of the atoms hold in the dipole trap .",
    "the maximum hold time is chosen to provide a typical loss of 30% , and thus varies between 1 and 7 s. because of anti - evaporation  @xcite , the temperature @xmath43 of the gas increases by about 10% during the decay process .",
    "the corresponding time evolution of @xmath43 needs to be taken into account to extract accurate values for @xmath37 .",
    "we perform time - of - flight absorption imaging at the end of the hold period to obtain the remaining atom number @xmath2 and the temperature @xmath43 at each @xmath45 . for each setting of the magnetic field , both @xmath2 and @xmath43",
    "are recorded as functions of the variable hold time @xmath45 .    to obtain the values for the loss - rate coefficient @xmath37 , we model the atomic number evolution by the differential equation @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the time - dependent effective volume .",
    "the differential equation is solved with the same method as used in ref .",
    "we numerically integrate the equation and fit it to the observed atom number evolution while leaving @xmath37 and the initial atom number @xmath48 as free parameters .",
    "since our model neglects the effect of the small temperature increase on @xmath37 , the results represent temperature - averaged values .",
    "we treat them as the @xmath37 values at the mean temperature . for the roughly 10% temperature increase",
    "the resulting errors are small and we consider them as part of the uncertainties of @xmath43 .       as a function of the inverse scattering length @xmath49 at finite temperatures , measured for the ground - state efimov resonance .",

    "a comparison between the results from the two fit methods provides information on model - dependent errors .",
    "we follow two different strategies to compare the uzr model to our experimental data . in the first case",

    "we only take into account the experimental points for @xmath59 to avoid the influence of a four - body resonance  @xcite , the effect of which is clearly visible in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : logl3](b ) , show a reasonable agreement with the experimental data .",
    "they reproduce the observed decrease of the resonant value of @xmath37 over more than three decades and they show a similar temperature shift of the maximum .",
    "a closer inspection , however , reveals significant deviations , in particular in the position of the loss maximum .",
    "our second strategy is to fit all curves independently and to extract the corresponding sets of three parameters for all different temperatures separately . for the resonance position extracted in this way we use the notation @xmath60 to emphasize the difference between this fit parameter of the uzr model and the true zero - temperature resonance position @xmath52 . indeed , our results in fig .",

    "the resonance shift seems to be universal , at least for different feshbach resonances of the same character in the same atomic system .",
    "another interesting case for which temperature - dependent experimental data are available is the excited - state efimov resonance in @xmath4li .",

    "<S> we interpret this contribution in terms of the finite range of the van der waals interaction in real atomic systems and we quantify it in an empirical way based on length scale arguments . </S>",
    "<S> a universal character of the corresponding resonance shift is suggested by observations related to other efimov resonances and the comparison with a theoretical finite - temperature approach that explicitly takes the van der waals interaction into account . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are of importance for the precise determination of efimov resonance positions from experiments at finite temperatures .    </S>"
