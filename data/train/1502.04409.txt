    "the interplay between spatial periodicity and non - linear dynamical evolution harbours a large number of interesting physical many body effects .",
    "a particularly outstanding one is the existence of unique soliton solutions that reside in the linear energy gaps between the bloch bands @xcite .",
    "these so - called gap solitons are characterized by several remarkable features : independent of the repulsive or attractive nature of the nonlinearity , gap - solitons are always bright solitons @xcite and even though they are spatial localized , they are intrinsically related to the extended bloch waves @xcite . the general properties of gap solitons have been intensively studied in many different nonlinear periodic systems , such as optical waveguide arrays and photonic lattices @xcite , semiconductor microcavities @xcite and also atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the latter systems allows very good control over all available physical parameters and matter - wave gap solitons @xcite have been observed experimentally for the first time in 2004 @xcite .",
    "another recent area of interest related to atomic becs is the behaviour of the atoms in the presence of spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "for neutral atoms this corresponds to a coupling between a pseudo - spin and the motional degrees of freedom and this interplay has in recent years shown to lead to intriguing new phases @xcite and to modified excitations and dynamics @xcite ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "similarly , solitonic solutions in the presence of spin - orbit coupling are predicted to show many interesting properties @xcite .",
    "however , as one of the prominent features of spin - orbit - coupled system is the presence of a broken galilean invariance @xcite , the conventional method of finding moving solitons using stationary ones is not applicable .",
    "it is therefore a nontrivial task to find moving soliton solutions @xcite .    the combination of spin - orbit coupling and optical lattices in bec experiments is particularly intriguing .",
    "spin - orbit coupling dramatically changes the bloch spectrum and , under suitable parameters , the lowest bloch bands can become flat @xcite .",
    "the collective excitation possesses novel roton - like structures @xcite .",
    "these new spectra are known to modify the standard mott - superfluid transition @xcite and allow for the existence of many exotic magnetic states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nontrivial dynamics , such as unconventional bloch oscillation @xcite and anomalous anderson localization @xcite , are predicted to appear .",
    "recently , kartashov _ et al .",
    "_ studied the properties of gap solitons in a spin - orbit - coupled bec in one and two dimensional spin - dependent optical lattices and demonstrated that gap solitons can be categorized according to their spin - dependent parity , time - reversal and translational symmetries @xcite .",
    "these studies provide a useful guideline for finding gap soliton solutions .",
    "however , the discussed systems have not yet been experimentally realized .",
    "so far , only two experimental approaches to prepare spin - orbit - coupled becs in lattice potentials exist .",
    "the first is a combination of raman lasers and a radio - frequency magnetic field @xcite , where both the raman beams and the radio - frequency field couple two energetic ground states of the atoms .",
    "the momentum imparted to the atoms from the raman beams generates artificial spin - orbit coupling , and meanwhile dresses the radio - frequency coupling to create spin - dependent lattice potentials .",
    "for this , however , the frequency difference between the raman beams has to be exactly the same as the frequency of the radio - frequency field , which is a significant limitation for the parameters space that can be explored .",
    "the second approach is to adiabatically load a raman coupled bec into a conventional optical lattice that is formed by two counter - propagating laser beams @xcite .",
    "a frequency difference between the lattice beams creates a moving lattice and by tuning the frequency difference , the bec can be loaded into any bloch band in the moving frame .    motivated by the experimental developments reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and theoretical studies @xcite , we present in this work a systematical study of the properties of gap solitons in an experimentally realisable spin - orbit - coupled bec in a one dimensional optical lattice . the properties of gap solitons existing in the first linear gap for the repulsive interactions were first studies in ref .",
    "@xcite and here we mostly focus on the two families of fundamental modes in the second gap , which have a number of interesting properties .",
    "if the detuning between the raman beams and energy states of the atoms is zero , the fundamental modes have well - defined parity symmetry and different families of the fundamental modes take the opposite sign of the parity . furthermore , the density distributions of the second family has a double humped structure , which disappears in the presence of small raman coupling , when the density distribution of the second family becomes similar to that of the first family . for non - zero detuning",
    ", the hamiltonian does not have the parity symmetry and we find that the spin compositions of different fundamental mode families differ significantly .",
    "this provides a possible experimental signature to distinguish them .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the description of our system in terms of dimensionless gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations .",
    "after that , in sec .",
    "[ sec : blochspectrum ] , we present the linear bloch spectrum and bloch waves , from which the position of the linear energy gaps are identified . the parity symmetry of the bloch waves is illustrated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : zero detuning ] we demonstrate in detail the properties of gap solitons considering the case of zero detuning .",
    "the case of non - zero detuning is analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonzero detuning ] and we conclude in sec .  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "our study is fully based on the very recent experimental realization of a spin - orbit - coupled bec by hamner _",
    "_ @xcite . to create spin - orbit coupling",
    ", they select two energy levels of @xmath0rb atoms , which act the pseudo - spin-@xmath1 , and raman couple them with a coupling strength @xmath2 , called the rabi frequency , and with a detuning given by @xmath3 .",
    "this raman coupling creates the spin - orbit coupling through the momentum transfer between the raman beams and the atoms and the hamiltonian that results from this coupling is given by @xmath4 here the @xmath5 are the pauli matrices , @xmath6 is the atom mass , and @xmath7 is the momentum of the atoms along the raman beams , which counter propagate along the @xmath8 direction .",
    "spin - orbit coupling happens in the same direction and the coefficient @xmath9 is proportional to the wavenumber of the raman beams @xmath10 .",
    "the spin - orbit - coupled bec is then loaded into a one dimensional optical lattice by adiabatically ramping up the lattice beams , which are optically aligned with the raman beams .",
    "the mean - field description of the spin - orbit - coupled lattice bec is then given by the coupled gp equations , @xmath11    \\psi +    2\\hbar \\sqrt{\\omega_x\\omega_y }    h_\\text{non } \\psi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the nonlinear terms @xmath12 originate from the atomic interactions .",
    "they are explicitly given by @xmath13 and the spinor wave - function is @xmath14 . here , @xmath15 is the wavenumber of lattice beams , @xmath16 is lattice depth which can be tuned by changing the intensity of the lattice beams , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the harmonic trap frequency in the transversal directions .",
    "we study an elongated bec , so that the weak harmonic trap along the @xmath8 direction can be neglected , and we assume that the dynamics in the transverse directions is completely frozen out due to large transversal trapping frequencies .",
    "the @xmath0rb atoms are characterized by repulsive interactions and the relevant s - wave scattering lengths are quantified by @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the experiment by hamner _",
    "@xcite the difference between the s - wave scattering lengths is very small and in the following we will assume @xmath21 for simplicity .    to find gap solitons numerically , we start from the dimensionless gp equations",
    "@xmath22 \\phi \\notag \\\\ & - \\frac{\\mathrm{v } } { 2}\\cos(2z )       \\phi +   ( \\left|   \\phi_1 \\right| ^2    + \\left|   \\phi_2 \\right| ^2 )        \\phi , \\label{tdgp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the units of energy , time and length are @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",

    "out this work we set @xmath35 corresponding to @xmath36 .",

    "this parity symmetry plays an important role in the specific form of the linear bloch spectrum and therefore also for the properties of the gap solitons as we will show in the remainder of this paper .",
    "once a gap soliton solution @xmath39 is found , its stability can be studied by simulating its long time behaviour using eq .  .",
    "for this we add 10% gaussian distributed noise to the wave function to trigger a possible instability and evolve the resulting state for 500ms .",
    "we also check the stability using the linear stability analysis by solving the standard bogoliubov de gennes equations .",
    "both , the results from nonlinear evolution and the linear stability analysis , are consistent with each other .",
    "since gap solitons only exist in the linear energy gaps , it is important to first identify the positions of these gaps . to do this , we use the bloch ansatz @xmath45 in eq .  , while neglecting the nonlinear terms . here",
    "the @xmath46 are periodic functions , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the band index and @xmath49 the quasi - momentum . the equations satisfied by the @xmath50 are then @xmath51    u_{n , k }   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we calculate the linear bloch spectrum by numerical diagonalization .    the application of the parity symmetry operation given in eq .   to above equations results in @xmath52 , if @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , for these linear equations , the parity behavior is the same as the time - reversal - like symmetry @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being the complex conjugate operator .",
    "while it might be natural to expect this symmetry in the spectrum , it is worth noting that it is broken by any non - zero detuning .",
