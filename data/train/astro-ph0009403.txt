    "@xmath53 , which is consistent with the ongoing trend observed since day  3270 from /wfpc2 imaging ( ls00 ) .",
    "as discussed below , the density difference does not have to be large .",
    "we constructed photoionization / recombination models for the inner ring to check the results derived from the plasma diagnostic line ratios in the previous section .",
    "the code for the model and the input elemental abundances were the same as those used in lundqvist ( 1999 ) , except for the si abundance which was reduced to si / h@xmath54 ( cf .",
    "recently , the spectrum from the supernova breakout has been re - calculated with the multienergy group radiation hydrodynamics code _ stella _ and it is in good agreement with the early ( up to @xmath7  day 150 ) optical / uv light curves of  ( @xcite ) . that result will be used later in a more thorough investigation of the rings ( p.  lundqvist , in preparation ) .",
    "here we used the model `` _ 500full1 _ '' burst spectrum of ensman &  burrows ( 1992 ) , which was accurate enough for our purposes .",
    "guided by the densities derived from the [ ] line ratio , we computed models for atomic densities in the range @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting electron density would be @xmath7 17% higher if the gas is fully ionized , but is probably the same as the atomic density in the epoch that we are considering .",
    "the inner radius of the ring is assumed to be @xmath56  cm , as in lundqvist &  fransson ( 1996 ) .",
    "we modeled the temperature sensitive ratios @xmath46 ( ) and @xmath46 ( ) as a function of atomic density ( figure  [ iring - mod ] ) .",
    "although the light travel time differences are not as important across the inner ring as for the outer rings ( see below ) , we included this effect in our models .",
    "the line ratios were calculated for two cases : an ionization - bounded model , and a model where we simulated a density - bounded situation by including only the innermost 25% of the ionized gas , which we referred to as `` 25% truncation '' . @xmath46 ( ) quickly increases from low values ( @xmath57 ) to very large values ( @xmath58 ) at a density in the range @xmath59 , the exact value of which depends on the degree of truncation . for example , @xmath46 ( ) = 50 is reached at @xmath60 for the @xmath61 truncation model , and at @xmath62 for the ionization - bounded case .    in our model ,",
    "the observed @xmath46 ( ) ratios in the inner ring are actually very sensitive to density .",
    "this is contrary to what is expected in the standard nebular analysis where @xmath46 ( ) is used to determine electron temperature because it is relatively insensitive to variations in electron densities .",
    "the reason for this discrepency is that the temperature of the emitting gas at a specific epoch in the  inner ring depends on the density of the gas , which drops faster for the higher density component .",
    "this translates directly into different line ratios for different density components within the gas .",
    "only models with an average temperature of the line emitting gas similar to the temperature given by the nebular analysis will give the correct line ratio .",
    "on the other hand , the degree of truncation has only minor effects on the dependence of the [ ] line ratio with density .",
    "assuming these two cases represent the range of possible models ( ls00 ) , we derived the [ ] density of the wir region to be @xmath63 and the [ ] density to be @xmath64 . for the eir region , the corresponding numbers were @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] emission come from regions of progressively lower density , consistent with the findings of ls00 .",
    "moreover , the densities derived in this paper ( day  4282 ) are somewhat lower than those in ls00 ( day  3000 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the trend that gas components of progressively lower density dominate the emission for a particular transition at later and later times .",
    "the higher the ionization potential of a line , the lower the density of the gas that emits it at a specific epoch .",
    "this has the interesting effect that the density components dominating the [ ] emission in the epoch studied in ls00 ( @xmath7  day 3000 ) , could be the same as those dominating the [ ] emission in this analysis ( day  4282 ) .",
    "with the emission from the outer rings much weaker than that from the inner ring , the uncertainties in the outer ring fluxes are much larger than those for the inner ring ( cf .",
    "table  [ tb - flux ] ) . both [ ] 5755 and [ ] 4363",
    "are absent , or very close to the noise limit , in our data for the outer rings .",
    "therefore we can not obtain a meaningful estimate of the electron temperature directly from the line ratios @xmath46 ( ) and @xmath46 ( ) . the [ ] 6716 , 6731 lines , on the other hand , are both relatively strong and do not suffer from systematic errors in background subtraction ( cf .",
    " [ anal ] ) . using the @xmath46 ( ) method (  [ iring ] ) , we arrived at a 1-@xmath50 upper limit on the electron density of the nor ( sor ) of @xmath67 , allowing for a @xmath25 between 5000  k and 10000  k. the derived outer ring densities are about a factor of two lower than the inner ring . the slightly higher electron density for the nor , which lies further away from us than the sor , may indicate that the effect of light travel time is important for the outer rings .",
    "as a consistency check , we also computed photoionization / recombination models for the outer rings to model the observed [ ] / , [ ] / , and [ ] /  flux ratios .",
    "the code and elemental abundances were the same as those used for the inner ring analysis (  [ i - model ] ) .",
    "we adopted @xmath68  cm as the distance of the outer rings from the supernova .",
    "this means that there is a @xmath69 day difference in age of the emission from the observed positions on the sor and nor (  [ obs ] ) .",
    "we took this different light travel time into account in our models .",
    "guided by the densities derived from @xmath46 ( ) for the outer rings , we ran models for atomic densities in the range @xmath70 .",
    "as discussed in lundqvist & fransson ( 1996 ) , the degree of ionization of the circumstellar gas after shock breakout is sensitive to the distance of the gas to the supernova .",
    "it is particularly important for the `` _ 500full1 _ '' model by ensman &  burrows ( 1992 ) because of the smaller number of high energy photons in the burst spectrum . at a distance 3.2 times farther away from the supernova than the inner ring ,",
    "the inner part of the outer rings was dominated by , , and  shortly after breakout , instead of the higher ionized species such as , and   that were present in the inner ring , at the density range that we are considering ( @xcite ) .",
    "we calculated that the maximum temperature reached in the outer rings from the initial uv flash was only @xmath71 k , a factor of @xmath37 smaller than that in the inner ring . at @xmath7  day 3500 , roughly the mean epoch of emission for the sor and nor positions we observed , for an atomic density of @xmath72 , the maximum temperature in the outer rings would be @xmath73  k , and the dominant ions , , and .",
    "for a density of @xmath74 , the dominant ions would be , , and  instead , and the temperature would be in the range @xmath75  k. in figure  [ oring - mod ] we show the modeled emissions in [ ] 6716 , 6731 , [ ] 6548 , 6583 , and [ ] 4959 , 5007 , normalized to  as functions of atomic density .",
    "similar to the inner ring , we considered two limiting cases for the outer ring modeling : an ionization - bounded model and a 25% truncation model ( cf .  ",
    "[ i - model ] ) .",
    "we plotted the observed normalized fluxes [ ] / , [ ] / , and [ ] /  for both the sor and nor regions for comparison with the models .",
    "for the nor , the density implied by the [ ] /  flux ratio in the model ( @xmath76 ) was indeed consistent with that indicated by the line ratio @xmath46 ( ) in table  [ tb - nete ] .",
    "we concluded that the observed nor [ ] lines could be interpreted with a model where the input s abundance was the same as that of the inner ring , i.e. , s / h  @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , figure  [ oring - mod ] also suggested that the nor [ ] and [ ] emissions were consistent with a model where the emitting gases ( @xmath78 ) were less dense than those in the inner ring , but with the same n and o abundances .",
    "our results favor a coeval scenario for the inner and outer rings , as argued for in crotts & heathcote ( 2000 ) .",
    "due to large uncertainties in the measured fluxes , caused largely by uncertainties in the background subtraction , we were unable to determine whether the nor is ionization- or density - bounded .",
    "for the sor , the [ ] density estimate from our model ( @xmath79 ) was again consistent with that from the @xmath46 ( ) calculations .",
    "however , even for the 25% truncation model , the modeled [ ] emission from the sor is @xmath80 higher than the observed value .",
    "in fact , only truncated models ( and possibly with even more truncation , such as a @xmath81 truncation model ) can possibly fit the results , if we assume that the n abundance in the sor is similar to that in the inner ring .",
    "the sor [ ] emission then implies a density @xmath82 .",
    "however , the [ ] density inferred for the sor in figure  [ oring - mod ] is @xmath83 .",
    "this result , that the [ ] -emitting region has higher density than that of the [ ] -emitting region in the sor , is opposite to what is expected ( cf .  ",
    "[ i - model ] ) .",
    "we note though , that the modeled ratio of [ ] / [ ] is the same as the observed sor value for a density of @xmath84 , which could either indicate a lower overall metal abundance in the sor than in the nor ( although with similar relative abundances of n and o ) , or that the adopted value of the lmc  background in the sor which we subtracted was too low . as described in ",
    "[ anal ] , the sor region is more vulnerable to background subtraction errors than the nor because it is fainter .",
    "the observed sor [ ] /  flux ratio could be brought to agreement with the model if the real lmc  background at the position of sor was @xmath7  10% larger than the value we have adopted . despite this problem , we note that the [ ] /h@xmath85 ratio is very sensitive to the density , placing a lower limit on the density of the emitting regions in both of the outer rings at @xmath84 .",
    "the densities we derive , @xmath86 , are somewhat larger than estimated by panagia et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who found @xmath87 on day 2887 for a single position of the northern outer ring .",
    "this is not necessarily a real contradiction , since the uv lines studied by panagia et al .",
    "probe mainly hot gas ( [ ] , ] , [ ] ) , which , in order to stay hot at these late epochs can not be dense .",
    "however , we do not feel that their result , that the n abundance in the outer rings is a factor of @xmath88 smaller than the inner ring , is conclusive .",
    "a time dependent , and self - consistent analysis is required to study the extreme non - equilibrium conditions encountered in the rings at late epochs .",
    "we close this discussion by noting that creating a density of @xmath86 at the position of the outer rings poses a real challenge to models of the formation of the ring system .",
    "for example , it is a factor @xmath89 higher than indicated by the models of blondin &  lundqvist ( 1993 ) and martin &  arnett ( 1995 ) . multidimensional models including photoionization by the progenitor have not yet demonstrated an improvement of this situation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "high quality spectra with good s / n are needed to accurately determine the temperature , ionization and abundances of the gas in the outer rings .",
    "the first evidence for the collision between the supernova ejecta and the inner circumstellar ring came in 1997 april from the stis observations of a  emission feature blueshifted up to @xmath90 that was projected near the inside edge of the spectral image of the ring ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent photometric observations with /wfpc2",
    "( @xcite ) and spectroscopic observations with stis ( @xcite ) of this hotspot ( spot  1 ) demonstrate continued brightening plus emissions in other species such as [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] .",
    "the appearance of spot  1 was explained as the result of the collision of the outer shock from the  debris with a dense knot of gas protruded inward towards the supernova from the ring .",
    "additional spots were predicted to appear once the debris collides with the rest of the ring .",
    "the presence of a new source of radiation was first reported in the ctio  1.08@xmath91 m image in 1999 december 25 by bouchet et al .",
    "subsequent stis ( maran , pun , &  sonneborn 2000 ) and wfpc2 ( garnavich , kirshner , &  challis 2000b ) imaging showed that 5 additional bright spots have developed around the inner ring . in figure  [ slit - pos](b ) , we point out a redshifted component in  in the g750 m ( 6581 ) spectral image which was first identified in this data by lawrence &  crotts ( 2000 ) .",
    "this high - velocity  emission originates from the inner edge of the eir region .",
    "no similar doppler - shifted emission is observed in our data for any other species .",
    "the position of this redshifted  flux coincides with that of spot 3 ( or hs2 - 106 , using the nomenclature of @xcite ) , one of the recently discovered new regions of brightening on the  inner ring reported by garnavich et al .",
    "( 2000b ) .",
    "measurements of spot 3 in the 2000 february 2 ( day  4727 ) wfpc2 images gave a position of 070 away from the center of the  debris and a position angle of 106 .",
    "this is the start of the full scale collision between the supernova ejecta and the inner circumstellar ring , as also pointed out by lawrence et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the combined  spectrum of the spot 3 and the overlapping portion of the eir is extracted in a similar manner as that described in  2 , except that fewer rows ( @xmath92 ) are integrated for the output spectrum . the extracted  profile for spot 3 and the ring",
    "is shown in figure  [ ha - spot ] .",
    "redshifted emission from spot 3 is clearly observed up to @xmath93 while the blueshifted component can not be identified because the extracted spectrum is dominated by the eir flux that fills the width of the aperture between @xmath94 .",
    "we fitted the rest of the  emission with a gaussian function and a linear background .",
    "the best - fit gaussian is shown by the dotted line in figure  [ ha - spot ] .",
    "the  flux from spot 3 derived from the best - fit parameters is @xmath95 ( no reddening correction ) . with only the redshifted profile available for fitting ,",
    "the fwhm of the emission is poorly constrained to be @xmath96 . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission - line width of spot  1 in  measured from much better s / n stis observations gives a fwhm width of @xmath97 ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent monitoring of the spot  1  radiation profile suggests that the width of the radiation remains constant with time ( c.s.j .",
    "pun , in preparation ) .",
    "if we assume that the intrinsic width of spots 1 and 3 are identical , then we expect the _ observed _ fwhm of the spot 3 profile to be @xmath98 , after correcting for the different position angles of the two spots on the ring . with the profile width fixed , we determined a more accurate spot 3 flux to be @xmath99 ( no reddening correction ) .",
    "the best fit profile is shown with dashed line in figure  [ ha - spot ] .",
    "the portion of this radiation ( @xmath768% , or @xmath100 ) that lies within the 02 aperture has been removed for the determination of the eir  inner ring flux ( cf .   [ anal ] ) .",
    "the spot  3 flux measured in this paper was consistent with the value previously reported using the same data by lawrence et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    using the calcphot task in the synphot package of the stsdas data reduction software",
    ", we converted the spot 3 flux in 1998 november to an equivalent stmag magnitude of 21.7 ( 0.4 ) .",
    "if we assume the rate of brightness increase for spot  3 is the same as that of spot  1 , @xmath101  mmag  day@xmath102 ( @xcite ) , then the extrapolated brightness for spot  3 on day  4727 will be 20.7 ( 0.4 ) .",
    "our predicted flux was @xmath103  mag fainter than the measured wfpc2  photometric result of 19.6 ( @xmath104 ) on day  4727 ( @xcite ) , probably caused by the fact that spot  3 is not centered within the stis aperture in our data .    finally , we comment on the monitoring of the interaction between the  debris and the circumstellar ring . while difference imaging in , [ ] , and  1.083@xmath91 m , where the newly - formed spots have the greatest contrast above the equatorial inner ring , may be a sensitive technique ( @xcite ) , it is susceptable to problems in separating the flux from the newly formed spots from the noisy background .",
    "it is not surprising that by separating the emission of the slow - moving ring ( @xmath105 ) from that of the interacting spots ( @xmath106 ) , radiation from spot 3 could be detected in the stis data at least one year before discovery by imaging , and over six months before it could be identified in pre - discovery images .",
    "this indicates that high resolution spectroscopic monitoring provides the best technique for discovering new areas of shock interaction in .",
