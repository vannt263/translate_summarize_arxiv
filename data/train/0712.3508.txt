    "it seems that the existing calculations of fission barriers overestimate energies of nuclear configurations close to scission by including a spurious contribution of kinetic energy of the fragments _ relative _ motion .",
    "this may be seen as follows : the binding of two separated selfbound systems is equal to @xmath4 , with @xmath5 fragment binding energies and @xmath6 coulomb energy . for a compound system , energy @xmath7 , should tend to @xmath8 for separate entities ,",
    "hence it should not contain fragment center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energies @xmath9 .",
    "however , in a standard hartree - fock ( hf ) , energy of a two - piece configuration still contains the term @xmath10 , corresponding to the relative motion of two fragments @xcite .    within the mean - field theory ,",
    "this overestimate arises from the c.m .",
    "kinetic energy correction that has to be subtracted from the expectation value of the hamiltonian ( energy functional ) to obtain the binding .",
    "the expectation value of the operator @xmath11 on the slater state reads : @xmath12 with @xmath13 labelling occupied single particle states , and @xmath14 nucleon mass .",
    "one should include one @xmath15 correction for a compound system , two corrections for two separate fragments , three corrections for three fragments , etc .",
    "for two distant fragments , @xmath16 , if one could _ distinguish _ particles belonging to each , which would imply the vanishing expectation value @xmath17 , @xmath18 the second term on the right - hand side is just the asymptotic ( for the distance @xmath19 ) value of kinetic energy of the fragments relative motion , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "this quantity becomes spurious for a two - piece system as it does not contribute to the binding .",
    "as noted by berger and gogny , @xcite this asymptotic term should be subtracted from the hf energy to obtain proper fusion barriers .    in practical hf calculations the @xmath15 correction is included in various forms ( see @xcite ) . here",
    "we confine the discussion to effective interactions which use the natural definition ( [ hfk ] ) . with such interactions",
    "one obtains @xmath23 mev for @xmath24 , decreasing with @xmath25 .",
    "this quantity should be subtracted from @xmath7 in a consistent theory : partially - for shapes with constriction , totally - for two - piece systems .",
    "this subtraction is usually included in calculations of fusion barriers ( otherwise the barriers are too high @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , but omitted in fission studies . however , even for fusion barriers , a gradual dependence of the correction on the compactness of the system is missing .    as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , the subtraction of the asymptotic value of @xmath26 brings the calculated hf fission barriers closer to the experimental values in medium - size @xmath27 nuclei . in the present work we estimate the effect of the shape - dependent correction @xmath28 on fission barriers in heavier nuclei , using the skyrme effective interaction sly6 @xcite ( section 3 ) .",
    "the correction is discussed and defined in section 2 , where we also consider a different treatment of the relative kinetic energy in the cluster model and in the mean - field theory .",
    "conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "it is remarkable that a correction of similar property and magnitude , although based on completely different grounds , @xcite has been introduced in macroscopic - microscopic calculations @xcite in order to obtain a better agreement with the experimenal fission barriers in the same regions of nuclei .",
    "the difficulty in the determination of the fission or fusion barrier discussed here is pertinent to nuclear models in which the binding energy of the far separated nuclei 1 and 2 treated as a one system is different from @xmath29 , with @xmath5 determined separately . since the standard hf belongs to this category , it needs a correction which would ensure that @xmath30 in fission ( with @xmath7 understood as adiabatic energy ) .",
    "the smoothness of such correction with the evolving nuclear shape is a natural requirement .    at the heart of the difficulty lies the identity of particles that impedes a definition of the relative coordinate and motion of two interacting subsystems .",
    "this problem is crucial in studies of light nuclei , where it is treated within the resonatig group method ( rgm ) that is basically a version of the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "a cluster configuration @xmath31 is represented as an expansion @xmath32 onto an overcomplete basis formed by states @xmath33 $ ] @xcite,@xcite with @xmath34 the cluster states depending on _ intrinsic _ coordinates , @xmath35 the amplitude of the relative motion and @xmath36 the antisymmetrizer containing permutations mixing the coordinates of the first @xmath37 with those of the last @xmath38 nucleons .",
    "thus , the label @xmath39 of the basis states assumes the role of the intercluster coordinate .    from the schrdinger equation for @xmath40",
    "one obtains the hill - wheeler equation for the amplitude of the relative motion in coordinate @xmath39 , with a well defined hamiltonian .",
    "however , a decomposition of this hamiltonian into kinetic and potential parts , @xmath41 , is arbitrary : the relative kinetic energy operator is _ assumed _ as @xmath42 with the reduced mass @xmath43 , and this _ fixes _ the potential @xmath44 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "so obtained potentials are much deeper in the compound nucleus region than those implied by the mean field ; in this way the pauli exclusion influences the relative motion of the overlaping clusters .",
    "it follows that while the rgm ( or gcm ) provides a solution to the relative motion problem , its ingredients , like the potential @xmath44 , do not seem to be of much use for the mean - field theory . as an aplication of the full rgm ( gcm )",
    "method for heavy nuclei would be prohibitively difficult , one would rather include a kinetic energy correction in the relatively simple hf method to improve energy asymptotics for separated clusters",
    ". however , this can not be just the expectation value of @xmath45{\\bf p}^2_{rel}$ ] in the slater state : owing to the incompatibility of the @xmath46 variable with the antisymmetry of the slater determinant , its value , @xmath47)/(2m)$ ] , is by @xmath0 10 mev larger than the proper value of @xmath26 .",
    "this is why obtaining the correct value of eq.([as ] ) requires an extention that goes beyond hf .",
    "some guidance might be provided by realistic internuclear potentials used in fusion studies , e.g. @xcite .",
    "these potentials have correct two - fragments asymptotics , but should be smoothly replaced by the mean - field energy for compact mononuclear configurations , where they become irrelevant .",
    "one possibility to proceed @xcite is to introduce a measure of the fragment separation @xmath48 which would replace the relative distance @xmath39 and define the subtracted portion of the relative kinetic energy , @xmath49 .",
    "to this aim , consider dispersion of the number of particles in the @xmath50-th hf orbital , residing in the volume @xmath51 of the first fragment with @xmath37 nucleons .",
    "this reads @xmath52 , with @xmath53 ( with many - particle correlations ignored ) . for completely divided fragments",
    "the @xmath50-th wave function is localized , so @xmath540 or 1 and dispersion vanishes .",
    "we define @xmath48 by means of dispersion averaged over the occupied orbitals : @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( with obvious modifications for pairing included ) .",
    "so defined @xmath48 is positive , reaches the maximal value 1 for separated fragments and falls to zero for wave functions uniformly smeared over two fragments .",
    "it has thus necessary properties to show main effects of a gradual inclusion of @xmath26 in hf energy .",
    "subtraction of a varying portion of @xmath26 will change energy balance between configurations with and without constriction , lowering the former with respect to the latter .",
    "as found in the study @xcite of fusion barriers , values of @xmath48 at the barrier vary between 0.7 and 0.9 and decrease together with the interfragment distance @xmath57 .",
    "the latter is defined as the distance between the centers of mass of two half - spaces , containing @xmath37 and @xmath38 nucleons . clearly , fusion barriers calculated using the shape - dependent correction @xmath58 are higher than those obtained by subtracting the whole asymptotic value @xmath26 .",
    "the related increase in the barrier height will depend on the slope @xmath59 ( without any correction ) : a small increase for a large positive slope , a larger increase ( and the barrier shift towards smaller @xmath57 ) for small positive or negative slopes .",
    "for example , with the sly6 force , the inclusion of the @xmath48-dependence leads to the increase in fusion barrier by 1.8 mev for @xmath60ca@xmath61ca and by 2.5 mev mev for @xmath60ca@xmath62pb , with the inward shift of the barrier top by 0.6 and 1.5 fm , respectively @xcite .    in the present study of fission barriers we use a different prescription for the relative kinetic energy correction . for a system of @xmath25 nucleons",
    "consider its division @xmath31 into volumes @xmath51 and @xmath63 .",
    "calculate the quantity @xmath64 for each wave function and call it localized in @xmath51 ( @xmath63 ) if @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , with some small @xmath67 ( we use @xmath68 ) .",
    "suppose that for a given nuclear shape ( configuration ) @xmath69 wave functions are localized in @xmath51 and @xmath70 in @xmath63 .",
    "then the correction for this shape is defined as @xmath71 this quantity tends to @xmath72 for no localization and to the asymptotic value @xmath26 for divided fragments ( full localization ) .",
    "the correction ( [ corr ] ) is more directly related to the localized orbitals than @xmath58 , but still not completely satisfactory .",
    "ultimately , it would be desirable to define the correction for relative kinetic energy as a part of the energy functional and treat it variationally .",
    "we have calculated the fission barriers with and without the @xmath28 correction in @xmath2hg and @xmath3u . pairing",
    "was included as the delta interaction in the bcs scheme , using the cutof according to the prescription of ref .",
    "the delta interaction strength was fixed at @xmath73 mev @xmath74 for neutrons and @xmath75 mev @xmath74 for protons .    the calculated fission barrier in @xmath2hg ( fig .",
    "1 ) is mass - symmetric ( @xmath76 ) and the saddle corresponds to a large elongation with the quadrupole moment close to @xmath77 b , cf fig . 2 . to relate fig . 1 to other studies",
    ", we mention that the energy plot for @xmath78 b , calculated with the gogny interaction , may be found in fig . 2 of @xcite , while the whole macroscopic - microscopic fission barrier was given in fig . 3 of @xcite .",
    "between the secondary minimum at @xmath79 b and @xmath80 b the hf minima are soft to mass - asymmetry or even slightly mass - asymmetric . our calculated barrier of 27.5 mev is lowered owing to the @xmath28 correction to 23.7 mev vs. the experimental value of 20.4 mev @xcite and 19.3 mev calculated in @xcite .",
    "it may be seen that the relative kinetic energy correction of 3.8 mev at the @xmath2hg fission barrier is smaller than those for @xmath1 nuclei @xcite , but still significant .",
    "hg , @xmath81300 b ; density contours 0.01 @xmath82 apart . ]",
    "the calculated barrier in @xmath3u is shown in fig .",
    "3 . the triaxial first hump of 7.55 mev at @xmath83 b and the mass - asymmetric second hump of 8 mev at @xmath84 b ( that agrees with the result with sly6 reported in @xcite ) are both larger than the experimental barriers ( inner and outer ) close to 6 mev @xcite,@xcite . at the second barrier ,",
    "the neck is still not yet developed ( cf shapes in fig .",
    "4 ) and single - particle orbitals are not well localized in parts of the volume corresponding to @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the partition chosen close to the maximum of the experimental mass yield @xcite .",
    "hence the @xmath28 correction vanishes and does not influence the barrier height in this case . for quadrupole moments",
    "@xmath87 b the localization begins and the correction grows slowly with @xmath88 . at @xmath89 b ( shape in fig .",
    "4 ) it amounts already to 1.9 mev .",
    "this implies that the barrier relevant for the quantum tunneling , while not being higher , becomes shorter .",
    "an estimate of the effect on the fission half - life may be obtained by using the relation @xmath90 , with action @xmath91 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "for @xmath92 we can use the cranking mass parameters , typical for the appropriate deformation range , calculated with the woods - saxon potential .",
    "an approximate relation between the quadrupole moment and the deformation parameter @xmath93 , @xmath94 , with the assumed @xmath95 fm , gives @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "between @xmath98 and 2.3 , where the correction causes an appreciable difference in the integrand of action , the mass parameter @xmath99 decreases from about 20 to 5 @xmath100/mev and is similar to @xmath101 , while @xmath102 increases from about 30 to 60 @xmath100/mev ( subscripts of the mass tensor refer to deformation parameters @xmath103 , @xcite ) . taking @xmath104/mev ( as @xmath105 increases with @xmath93 , @xmath106 ) , and estimating @xmath107",
    "as @xmath108 with @xmath109 equal to 1.0 mev ( cf fig.3 ) , we obtain a rough estimate @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the expected change in the fission half - life is about two orders of magnitude , compared to the experimental value of @xmath112 of 23.4 @xcite .",
    "the true correction @xmath113 is probably at least that large : the recently calculated selfconsistent cranking inertia parameters @xcite , that should be used in the exact calculation , seem larger than the woods - saxon cranking mass parameters .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the calculated barriers will be still lowered by the rotational correction . in @xmath3u",
    ", one can expect more than a 1 mev correction at the first barrier , and more than a 2 mev correction at the second barrier , based on calculations @xcite .",
    "an even larger rotational correction should be expected for @xmath2hg at the barrier , owing to a larger deformation .",
    "125 b , left ) and beyond the barrier ( @xmath81200 b , right ) configurations in @xmath3u ; density contours 0.01 @xmath82 apart . ]",
    "125 b , left ) and beyond the barrier ( @xmath81200 b , right ) configurations in @xmath3u ; density contours 0.01 @xmath82 apart . ]",
    "correctly calculated energies of nuclear shapes with constriction become lower than in the standard approach , so such shapes , in particular scission configurations , are less excited with respect to more compact configurations . here",
    "are some consequences of this correction for theoretical predictions :    fission barriers with configurations close to scission are lowered by aproximately @xmath15 which weakly depends on the mass number @xmath25 .",
    "this brings the calculated fission barriers in relatively light ( @xmath114 nuclei much closer to the data @xcite .",
    "a smaller correction is expected for fission barriers in @xmath115 nuclei , e.g. in @xmath2hg ( fig .",
    "this is consistent with very elongated , constricted shapes at the fission saddles in these nuclei , quite different , however , from scission configurations .",
    "fission barriers with energy at the scission point close ( within a few mev ) to that at the ground state become shorter , and this leads to a moderate decrease in fission half - lives ( fig . 3 for @xmath3u ) .",
    "modifications are expected for barriers and half - lives for multipartition and multifragmentation ; a scission configuration for triparition will be lowered by @xmath116 , that for the decay into four fragments by @xmath117 , etc .",
    "one can also notice that the correction to barriers would tend to destabilize hypothethic hyperdeformed minima studied in ref .",
    "@xcite    due to the magnitude of the correction , it lowers substantially fission barriers ( up to the actinides ) and modifies fission life - times , except for the superheavy nuclei .",
    "even there , the correction should be accounted for when considering fission dynamics .",
    "a related correction may be necessary in methods other than hf , unless they correctly and smoothly describe binding during fission and fusion .",
