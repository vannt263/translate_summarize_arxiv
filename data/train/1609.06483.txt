    "instead one has to take the explicit evolution of quantum phases into account and resort to either coarse - graining methods @xcite or compensate for a short timespan of non markovian dynamics @xcite .",

    "does non - diffusive heat transfer appear in any type of small quantum systems ?",

    "is it possible to understand the crossover from the quantum to the macroscopic classical behavior ?    in this paper we investigate non - diffusive heat transport in a one - dimensional isotropic quantum xy spin chain .",
    "this system was chosen because it is simple , well understood , and can also be solved analytically @xcite . moreover ,",
    "quantum spin chains are known to exhibit spin waves @xcite , which can be expected to serve as a natural carrier of heat .",
    "although the xy chain does not exhibit a phase transition at finite temperature , its ground state shows a quantum , i.e. , zero temperature , phase transition from superfluid to mott insulating behaviour if the nearest - neighbor interaction is weak enough @xcite .",
    "in addition , the impact of ballistic transport is expected to be particularly strong in 1d systems @xcite . for this reason the chosen model is an excellent candidate for the study of non - conventional heat transport .",
