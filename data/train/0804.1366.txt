    "models of complex networks can be roughly split into two classes : static and growth models .",
    "static models , such as classical random graphs  @xcite and their generalizations  @xcite , generate a whole network at once , trying to directly reproduce some properties observed in real network snapshots .",
    "growth models , e.g. , preferential attachment  @xcite , construct networks by adding a node at a time , attempting to provide some insight into the laws governing network evolution . compared to static models , it is generally more difficult to closely match observed network properties with growth models , because in this case one usually has less direct control over the properties of modeled networks .",
    "the first growth model that matched the observed internet topology surprisingly well , across a wide spectrum of network properties , was the positive - feedback preference ( pfp ) model by zhou and mondragn  @xcite . in the model , at each time step",
    ", one node is added to the network , and connected to the existing nodes by two or three links , choosing different link placement options with different probabilities .",
    "the most important property of the model is that the probability to connect a new node to the existing nodes of degree @xmath0 is a superlinear function of @xmath0 .",
    "although there are many other models of the internet evolution , e.g.  @xcite , the pfp model stands apart as it gives rise to the following unresolved paradox .",
    "on the one hand the model matches perfectly the observed internet , while on the other hand , since it is explicitly based on preferential attachment with a superlinear preference kernel , it can not produce , in the thermodynamic limit , any scale - free networks  @xcite , including the internet .    here",
    "we resolve this paradox by showing that superlinear preferential attachment can have vast preasymptotic regimes .",
    "specifically , we first find an analytic asymptotic solution for superlinearly growing networks with arbitrary average degree , confirming that the asymptotic regime is indeed degenerate  regardless of the average degree , only a finite number of nodes have high degrees ( section  [ sec : analytic - solution ] ) . however , in section  [ sec : preasymptotic ] , we show that if the preference kernel is not too superlinear and if the average degree is not too low , then this asymptotic regime becomes noticeable only at network sizes that are orders of magnitudes larger than the size of any real network , including the internet .",
    "we thus half - resolve the paradox by showing that the pfp model _ can _ , in fact , match the internet .",
    "section  [ seq : rcc - vs - jdd ] resolves the other half , by explaining why the model _ does _ so : its design implicitly reproduces the degree correlations in the internet , which are known to define almost all important topological properties , except clustering  @xcite .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] with an outline of our findings and their implications .",
    "in this section we derive the analytic solution for the degree distribution of superlinearly growing networks ( slgns ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we begin by recalling what is known for networks grown by adding a single link per node ( the average degree @xmath1 ) , and then generalize to the case with multiple links .",
    "the case when a new node attaches to exactly one existing target ( or host ) node is well - studied  @xcite .",
    "let the probability that the new node selects a host node of degree @xmath0 be @xmath2 where the summation is over all @xmath3 existing nodes and @xmath4 s are their degrees .",
    "then the asymptotic degree distribution is a stretched exponential for sub - linearly growing networks ( @xmath5 ) and a power law for linearly growing networks ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "superlinearly growing networks with @xmath7 are asymptotically star graphs .    specifically , if @xmath8 , then the number of nodes with degrees @xmath9 remains finite in the thermodynamic limit @xmath10 , meaning that almost all nodes have degree @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 , then the number @xmath14 of nodes with degree @xmath15 ( degree-@xmath15 nodes ) grows as @xmath16 , while the number of nodes with degrees @xmath17 remains finite . if @xmath18 , then @xmath19 , and the number of nodes with degrees @xmath20 is finite .",
    "in other words , there is an infinite series of `` phase transitions '' at critical values @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , and the degree distribution in slgns with @xmath23 lying between these critical values , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , is given by @xmath26    in what follows we also consider the _ extremal growth _ rule , which formally corresponds to the @xmath27 limit , and specifies that a new node attaches to the existing node with the maximum degree . if there are several nodes with the same maximum degree , then the host node is randomly selected among them .",
    "slgns grown according to this rule stay stars throughout their evolution , assuming they are stars at the beginning .",
    "if an slgn is not initially a star , then extremal growth evolves it to almost a star , with all new nodes attaching to a maximum - degree node in the initial graph .",
    "adding one link per node results in growing trees , which are not good models of real complex networks that all have strong clustering .",
    "but even if we are not concerned with the models realism , there is another reason to consider slgns with multiple links added per new node .",
    "while for sub - linearly growing networks , adding more than one link should not qualitatively change the degree distribution , this modification may have a more prominent effect on the degree distributions in superlinearly growing networks .",
    "indeed , the more links per node we add in slgns with a finite @xmath23 , the stronger the deviations from stars we obviously expect to observe . in view of the pfp model paradox",
    ", one might even start suspecting that multiple links may resurrect power laws .",
    "we thus have to exercise more care dealing with multiple - link slgns .",
    "in what follows , we first consider them under the extremal growth rule , and then remove this restriction .",
    "we denote by @xmath28 the number of links added per new node .",
    "the pfp model uses a superposition of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 cases , and a combination of the following two link placement options : place a link either between the new and host nodes , or between the host and another existing node , called the peer node .",
    "links are always placed such that the subgraph induced by the new links is connected and contains the new node , so that the network stays connected at each time step . for concreteness , we shall assume that @xmath28 is a fixed positive integer , and consider cases with different @xmath28 separately .",
    "another important restriction is that we construct simple graphs , i.e. , self - loops and multiple links between the same two nodes are not allowed .",
    "we first focus on the case with @xmath29 . in this case",
    "we have only two options to place two links ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : link - placement ] ) : place both links between the new and host nodes , or place one link between the new and host nodes , and place another link between the host and peer nodes .",
    "the both options , or any their superposition , produce the same result .",
    "let the initial network be two disconnected nodes . adding the third node according to the extremal growth rule creates the star graph with three nodes .",
    "we shall represent our graphs by their degree sequences @xmath31 .",
    "the degree sequence representation turns out to define , up to an isomorphism , the graphs grown according to our extremal growth rule .",
    "the star graph after the first step is @xmath32 in this representation . applying the extremal growth rule to add the fourth node",
    ", we obtain @xmath33 , and then @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and generally @xmath36    we prove ( [ book ] ) by induction .",
    "we already checked its validity for small @xmath3 . assuming that ( [ book ] ) holds for some @xmath37 , we establish it for @xmath38 .",
    "if we place the two links according to the first option , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : link - placement - a ] , then the new node attaches to the nodes with degrees @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "thus degree @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the new node acquires degree @xmath15 , other degrees do not change , and the new graph has indeed the same structure ( [ book ] ) .",
    "if we use the other link placement option shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : link - placement - b ] , we must choose the node of degree @xmath40 as the host node .",
    "we can not attach the new node to the node of degree @xmath39 because this latter node is already connected to all other nodes , and therefore we can not add the second link between this hub node and any peer node . selecting the node of degree @xmath40 as the host , we notice that it is connected to all other nodes , except the degree-@xmath11 node .",
    "therefore this latter node is the only choice for the peer node .",
    "hence @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the new node acquires degree @xmath11 , and other degrees do not change . thus the new graph has the same structure ( [ book ] ) .",
    "we shall call the graphs series ( [ book ] ) the _ open @xmath15-books_. the justification for this name is as follows .",
    "the link between the two nodes of highest degrees , denoted by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , is the _ binding _ of an open book .",
    "each degree-@xmath15 node is connected to @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the resulting triangle is a _",
    "page_. thus , an open @xmath15-book contains @xmath47 triangular pages . finally , the link between the highest - degree node @xmath45 and the dangling degree-@xmath11 node is a built - in _ bookmark_. the open @xmath15-book graph with @xmath48 nodes is shown in fig .  [ open ] .",
    "-book ( 8,7,2,2,2,2,2,2,1 ) . ]",
    "note that we can call a star an open @xmath11-book .",
    "it does not have bookmarks , its binding is the hub node , and its @xmath39 pages are all the links .",
    "we now move to the case with three links added per new node , @xmath30 .",
    "generalizing the link placement options for two links , there are four options for placing three links , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : link - placement - m=3 ] . choosing the first option with three host nodes ( fig .",

    "the link placement option in fig .",
    "[ fig : link - placement - m=3c ] results in exactly the same graph series . placing links as in fig .",
    "[ fig : link - placement - m=3d ] , we obtain almost the same graph series , except that the first graph is @xmath55 .",
    "the option in fig .",
    "[ fig : link - placement - m=3b ] leads to a different graph series , but almost all nodes still have degree @xmath56 .",
    "+    we call the graph series ( [ book2 ] ) _ open @xmath56-books_. the binding is the triangle @xmath57 connecting the three nodes @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath58 of highest degrees @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath47 .",
    "each page is a tetrahedron @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is one of the @xmath61 degree-@xmath56 nodes .",
    "thus , an open @xmath56-book has @xmath61 tetrahedral pages",

    "even though the exact open book structure is almost surely destroyed , the distortion is still asymptotically small and admits analytic estimates .",
    "indeed , let us first estimate the number @xmath84 of degree-@xmath56 nodes in an @xmath3-sized slgn with @xmath29 and @xmath83 .",
    "this number grows if instead of connecting to the highest - degree node with probability @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ jj ] ) , the new node selects the other option and connects to a degree-@xmath15 node with probability @xmath86 .",

    "( [ n3 ] ) gives @xmath90 which we juxtapose against simulations in section  [ sec : preasymptotic ] .",

    "another apparent disagreement is that according to our analysis , @xmath99 for all @xmath100 , while the pfp model simulations show that @xmath101 for all @xmath0 .",
    "the explanation of these paradoxes lies in the fact that the pfp model has a vast preasymptotic regime , and both the internet size and sizes achievable in simulations lie deep within this regime . in this section , we describe two main factors that render this regime extremely vast for the pfp - modeled internet .",

    "nothing is known about fluctuations of the degree distribution , the analysis of which is difficult even in the simpler case of linear preferential attachment  @xcite .",

    "we have shown in the previous section that the power laws empirically observed in the pfp model do not contradict the asymptotic open book structure of slgns , since typical network sizes considered in simulations are preasymptotically small . however",
    ", this argument does not explain why the pfp model almost exactly reproduces not only the power - law degree distribution observed in the real internet , but also a long list of other important network properties .",
    "since the preasymptotic regime is not amenable to straightforward analytic treatment , in this section we approach the problem from a different angle , and provide a simple explanation based mostly on previous empirical work .",
    "we first notice that the fact that the pfp model exhibits preasymptotic power - law behavior is not so much surprising , because for @xmath6 the model produces asymptotic power laws , and this asymptote is quickly achieved for small @xmath3 .",
    "the results of the previous section indicate that if @xmath136 and @xmath113 , then this power - law asymptotic behavior unnoticeably changes to preasymptotic , slowly transforming into the new asymptotic behavior only for very large @xmath3 .    yet",
    "this argument does not explain why the pfp model reproduces so many other network properties observed in the internet .",
    "previous work  @xcite shows that the degree distribution alone does not fully define all other internet s properties , i.e. , the internet is not @xmath137-random in the terminology of @xcite , but is almost @xmath138-random  its structure is very close to the structure of maximally random graphs constrained by its @xmath15-point degree correlations , or the joint degree distribution ( jdd ) defined by the total number @xmath139 of links between degree-@xmath0 and degree-@xmath140 nodes . in other words ,",
    "the internet s jdd narrowly defines almost all its other important properties , except clustering @xcite .",
    "although the pfp model is not concerned with the jdd _ per se _ , it reproduces precisely the observed rich club connectivity ( rcc ) @xmath141 defined as the ratio of the number of links in the subgraph induced by the @xmath142 highest degree nodes to the maximal number of such links @xmath143 .",
    "the values of @xmath141 observed in the internet for small @xmath142 are substantially higher than in networks grown according to linear preferential attachment .",
    "superlinear preference increases the connectivity density among high - degree nodes , which explains why the pfp model successfully captures the observed rcc .    in the rest of this section",
    "we analyze the relationship between the jdd and rcc .",
    "specifically , the jdd almost fully defines rcc : any two graphs with the same jdd have almost the same rcc . while the converse is generally not true , a given form of rcc introduces certain constraints to the jdd .",
    "given the jdd s definitive role for the internet topology , we conclude that reproducing internet s rcc must significantly improve the accuracy in capturing all other properties of the internet topology that depend on degree correlations , which explains the success of the pfp model and provides clear grounds for the discussion in  @xcite .    to see that the jdd almost fully defines rcc is straightforward  @xcite .",
    "we first get rid of the node rank @xmath142 in @xmath141 .",
    "the rank of a node is its position in the degree sequence sorted in decreasing order , i.e. , as in ( [ book ] ) .",
    "recall that the node rank is essentially the complementary cumulative distribution function for node degrees : if @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the degree and rank of node @xmath146 , @xmath147 is the maximum degree , and if we denote @xmath148 , then @xmath149 .",
    "thus , the jdd and rcc are directly related via @xmath150 defined as the total number of links between degree-@xmath0 nodes and nodes @xmath146 of higher degrees",
    "@xmath151 @xmath152 it follows that the jdd defines rcc , up to reordering of nodes of the same degree .    to illustrate how the rcc constrains jdd",
    ", we choose to consider a common projection of the jdd , the average degree of the nearest neighbors of degree-@xmath0 nodes @xmath153 .",
    "we first look at the maximum and minimum possible value of @xmath153 for a class of graphs with some fixed degree distribution with minimum and maximum degrees of @xmath11 and @xmath147 .",
    "we then suppose that @xmath150 is also given as a constraint , and we quantify how this constraint narrows down the spectrum of possible values of @xmath153 .",
    "it is easy to see that the minimum and maximum values of @xmath153 without the @xmath150 constraints are simply @xmath11 and @xmath147 , if we neglect any structural constraints that a given form of the degree distribution imposes on possible jdds .",
    "for example , if @xmath154 , then @xmath155 can not be @xmath147 , it is necessarily less than @xmath147 .",
    "scale - free networks with @xmath156 have these constraints for links connecting nodes of degrees @xmath0 and @xmath140 such that @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "to formally see that without such constraints the minimum and maximum of @xmath153 is @xmath11 and @xmath147 , let @xmath158 be the factor taking care of links between nodes of the same degree in @xmath159 , so that the total number @xmath160 of `` edge ends '' ( stubs ) attached to degree-@xmath0 nodes is @xmath161 .",
    "we then have , by definition , @xmath162 ( the more common definition for the normalized distributions @xmath163 and @xmath164 such that @xmath165 is @xmath166 . ) the minimum ( maximum ) values of  @xmath153 are achieved when all degree-@xmath0 nodes are attached only to the nodes with the minimum ( maximum ) degrees , @xmath167 where the minimum ( maximum ) is taken over all possible jdd matrices @xmath168 yielding the given degree distribution @xmath160 .",

    "suppose now that @xmath172 is given as a constraint .",
    "note that @xmath173 is not precisely equal to @xmath150 , but we neglect this extra @xmath174 term here as well , partly because in the internet , @xmath174 is relatively small for almost all @xmath0 . introducing ratio @xmath175 , which is approximately the ratio of the number of links connecting degree-@xmath0 nodes and nodes of higher degrees to the number of all links attached to degree-@xmath0 nodes , we write the new minimum value of @xmath153 as    @xmath176    where the minimum is now taken over all jdds @xmath168 satisfying the rcc constraints .",
    "similarly , for the maximum possible value , we have @xmath177 and the maximum possible difference is @xmath178    compared to the unconstrained case , the relative decrease of the range of possible values of @xmath153 , assuming large  @xmath147 , is @xmath179 in disassortative networks , such as the internet @xcite , most links incident to medium- and high - degree nodes lead to low - degree nodes , meaning that @xmath180 except for @xmath181 . given ( [ eq : delta_delta ] ) , we conclude that the rcc introduces significant constraints to the jdd , reflected even in a jdd s simple summary statistic @xmath153 , except for lowest degrees @xmath182 , and perhaps highest degrees @xmath183 , for which our analysis may be not very accurate since we neglected the structural constraints that are relevant in the high - degree zone .",

    "preferential attachment is a robust mechanism that may be responsible for the emergence of the power - law degree distributions in some complex networks  @xcite .",
    "however , power laws emerge only if the preference kernel is a linear function of node degree  @xcite . if one believes that preferential attachment is a driving force , explicit or implicit , behind the evolution of complex networks , then the natural question one has to face",
    "is why this kernel must be exactly linear in so many so different complex systems .    in this paper",
    "we argue that even if the preference kernel is not linear but slightly superlinear , preferential attachment may still produce scale - free networks , except that it does so not in the asymptotic but in a vast preasymptotic regime .",
    "two key factors contribute to the depth of this regime : 1 )  how close the preference kernel is to being linear , and 2 )  how many links are added per new node . these factors allow us to say , informally , that multiple links added under slightly superlinear preferential attachment resurrect power laws , although only by means of deepening the preasymptotic regime .",
    "the asymptotic regime is still degenerate : adding @xmath28 links leads to the asymptotic degree distribution @xmath187 .",
    "more precisely , the asymptotic network structure is a distorted ( or `` torn '' ) open @xmath28-book  a generalization of the known object in topology  @xcite .",
    "the level of distortion depends on how close the preference kernel is to a linear function .",
    "similar to the @xmath93 case ( the open @xmath11-book is a star ) , we find an infinite series of connectivity transitions characterizing the degree of damage to the open book structure , as the kernel approaches a linear function .",
    "to explain the success of one particular superlinear model  the positive - feedback preference model  @xcite  in capturing not only the degree distribution but also many other important properties of one particular complex network , the internet , we analyze the both - way relationship between the joint degree distribution ( @xmath15-point degree correlations ) and rich - club connectivity .",
    "the former defines the latter , while the latter constrains the former .",
    "these constraints , captured by the model , suffice to reproduce many other important internet s properties , since it has been shown that most of them , except clustering , depend only on the joint degree distribution  @xcite .",
    "given that the depth of the preasymptotic regime increases with the number @xmath28 of links added per node , and that the average degrees @xmath188 of some complex networks including the internet have been reported to grow with network size @xcite , our findings , taken altogether , imply that some complex networks may exist in vast preasymptotic regimes of evolution processes that have degenerate network formations as their asymptotes .",
    "we contrast this implication with the observation that the vast majority of the existing network evolution models are designed with the goal to yield asymptotic power - law distributions , quickly achievable at small network sizes .",
    "an interesting open question is whether the dynamics of the world economy supports our findings .",
    "specifically , does the superlinear growth of wealth contribute to such effects as the `` shrinking middle class '' @xcite and growing wealth inequality @xcite ?",
    "more succinctly , is the pareto distribution preasymptotic  @xcite ?",

    "a sufficiently large network is thus not an open book exactly , yet the deviation from this structure is rather small .",
