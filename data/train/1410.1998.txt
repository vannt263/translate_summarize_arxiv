    "image inpainting is a frequently arising problem in image processing .",
    "examples are restoring scratches in photographs , removal of superimposed objects , dealing with areas removed by a user , digital zooming , edge decoding , restoration of defects in audio / video recordings or in seismic data .",
    "the term ` inpainting ' first appeared in  @xcite , but earlier work on disocclusions was already done , e.g. , in  @xcite . in this respect",

    "inpainting is a very active field of research which has been tackled by various approaches . for a good overview",

    "while exemplar - based and sparsity - based ( dictionary / frame / tensor ) methods are in general better suited for filling large texture areas , diffusion - based and corresponding variational techniques show good results for natural images . the total variation ( tv ) regularized model proposed in  @xcite for denoising",
    "was first applied to inpainting in  @xcite .",
    "it was later also used in combination with other methods , however , the tv regularizer typically introduces a staircasing effect in the corresponding minimizer . a simple method to avoid these artifacts consists in the incorporation of second order derivatives into the model . indeed , starting with  @xcite",
    "various approaches with higher order derivatives have been proposed , see , e.g. ,  @xcite . in this paper , we address the problem of inpainting cyclic data using a variational model with second order cyclic differences . in general , manifold - valued data processing has recently gained a lot of interest .",
    "examples are wavelet - type multiscale transforms for manifold data  @xcite and manifold - valued partial differential equations  @xcite .",

    "have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "these papers extend the previous work  @xcite on @xmath0-valued functions where , in particular , the existence of minimizers of certain energies is shown in the space of functions with bounded total cyclic variation .",
    "first order tv minimization for cyclic data in image processing has been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the authors unwrap the data to the real line and propose an algorithm based on functional lifting which takes the periodicity into account .",
    "in particular , they also consider cyclic inpainting .",
    "an algorithm for tv minimization on riemannian manifolds was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the approach is based on a reformulation as a multilabel optimization problem with an infinite number of labels .",
    "using convex relaxation techniques , the resulting hard optimization problem is approximated which also requires the discretization of the manifold .",
    "another approach for denoising manifold - valued data via first order tv minimization was given in  @xcite .",
