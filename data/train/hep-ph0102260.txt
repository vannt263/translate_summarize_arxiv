    "the investigation of matter under extreme conditions and the modifications of hadron properties with density or temperature is one of the main topics in intermediate and high - energy nuclear physics .",
    "experimentally , the cleanest information is obtained from electromagnetic probes which penetrate the medium almost undisturbed . in the vector dominance model of sakurai @xcite electromagnetic processes",
    "are mediated by neutral vector mesons ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore possible medium modifications of vector mesons attract particular interest . for example",
    ", the dilepton data measured by the ceres collaboration in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite seem to give evidence for a change of the @xmath0-meson properties in hot or dense nuclear matter .",
    "the strong enhancement of dilepton production at low invariant masses ( @xmath8 ) , was interpreted by li et al .",
    "@xcite as a signature for a dropping @xmath0-meson mass , conjectured by brown and rho @xcite as a consequence of scale invariance and partial restoration of chiral symmetry",
    ". on the other hand the ceres data could also be explained in an alternative way by a strong broadening of the @xmath0-meson in the medium due to resonance formation @xcite and medium modifications of the pion cloud @xcite .",
    "( for a review see @xcite . )    despite of the phenomenological success of this viewpoint , the role of chiral symmetry is not obvious",
    ". an important consequence of chiral symmetry restoration is that the vector and axial - vector ( isovector ) correlators , which differ in vacuum due to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , have to become identical in the restored phase , i.e. at high temperature or density . as a precursor , already at much lower temperatures",
    "the correlators start to mix , i.e. the in - medium vector correlator receives contributions proportional to the vacuum axial - vector correlator and vice versa @xcite .    roughly speaking ,",
    "the vector correlator is dominated by the @xmath0 meson , while the axial - vector correlator gets important contributions from the pion and from the @xmath1 meson . in this sense , in the above - mentioned phenomenological models the medium modification of the @xmath0-meson could be interpreted as some kind of mixing phenomenon , caused by thermal or nuclear pions @xcite . certainly , it would be much more satisfactory , to start from a model which is manifestly chirally symmetric and to study both , the vector correlator and the axial - vector correlator simultaneously . among other things",
    "this implies that we have to include the @xmath1-meson and to treat it on an equal footing with the @xmath0 . of course , to obtain a realistic description , it is not sufficient to stay at tree - level , where the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are stable particles without width , but we should also include the most important decay channels @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this requires at least a one - loop calculation .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to construct such a model in vacuum , while the application to finite temperatures will be the topic of a later publication .    in the 1960s",
    "the gauged linear @xmath11 model emerged as a combination of the gell - mann ",
    "lvy @xmath11 model , which exhibits the essential features of the spontaneously broken global @xmath12 chiral symmetry @xcite , and sakurai s idea of vector meson dominance @xcite , in which a yang - mills gauge theory is constructed with the @xmath13 isospin group as a gauge group and the @xmath14 meson as the gauge boson .",
    "analogously , lee and nieh @xcite have built a lagrangian with local @xmath15 symmetry and @xmath14 and @xmath16 mesons as gauge bosons .",
    "the local ( gauge ) symmetry is explicitly broken only by the vector meson mass terms , leading to the current - field identities , and global chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken as in the ordinary @xmath11 model , leading to the @xmath17 mass splitting . in order to render the theory renormalizable , t hooft proposed to generate the vector meson mass by using the higgs mechanism rather than by explicitly breaking the local symmetry @xcite",
    ".    however , from a modern point of view , there seems to be no reason why in an effective hadronic model chiral symmetry should be a local symmetry , while it is only a global symmetry in qcd , the underlying fundamental theory .",
    "in fact , the main advantage of this concept is that it allows only for a small number of free parameters since all couplings of gauge fields are determined by only one coupling constant @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the `` pure '' gauged linear ( or non - linear ) @xmath11 model as described above ( including the vector - meson mass term ) gives the wrong phenomenology of @xmath14 and @xmath16 mesons . in the literature",
    "one finds two strategies to cure this problem .",
    "the first one consists of adding terms of higher dimension ( i.e. with more fields or derivatives ) to the lagrangian , which are still invariant under local transformations .",
    "one term of this kind was already considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that this is not sufficient , and therefore one more term was added . in a more recent work @xcite this strategy was combined with the second one , which consists of introducing further gauge - invariance breaking terms in addition to the mass term .",
    "of course , these terms destroy the current field identity , but we do not believe that this is a severe objection against this strategy .",
    "one could even argue that the current - field identity can not be valid in nature , since it is in contradiction to the large four and six pion continuum observed in the vector correlator above the @xmath14 resonance . in this article",
    "we will completely abandon the concept of local symmetry .",
    "we will show that in this way we can reproduce rather the experimentally measured spectral functions of the vector and the axial - vector correlators without adding terms of higher dimension .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sectl ] we introduce the lagrangian of our model .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the properties of the gauged linear @xmath11 model in sect .",
    "[ sectlgauged ] .",

    ". [ sectlglobal ] , we relax the constraints imposed by the gauge symmetry , retaining only a global chiral symmetry .",

    "here special care is taken , not to destroy the symmetries of the model by an unsuited regularization scheme .",
    "since we give up the current - field identity , the vector and axial - vector currents are not just proportional to the fields , but involve additional terms .",
    "the corresponding correlation functions are derived in sect .",

    ", we draw conclusions .",
    "in this section we want to construct the chirally symmetric lagrangian which will be the starting point for our analysis . in view of the phenomenological success of the vector dominance model @xcite in the vector channel , the gauged linear @xmath11 model @xcite , which is its generalization to @xmath12 chiral symmetry , seems to be a natural candidate . in the literature , this model served e.g. as a toy model for the calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson properties in a hot meson gas @xcite .",
    "however , as we will discuss , the gauged linear @xmath11 model does not correctly reproduce the phenomenology of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in vacuum , and we will have to modify it .",
    "it is nevertheless useful to begin with a brief review of the basics of this model because most of the definitions and formulas given here will remain valid after our modifications .",
    "defining the four - component field @xmath20 we can write the lagrangian of the mesonic part of the linear @xmath11 model as @xmath21 for @xmath22 chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , yielding massless pions . to obtain massive pions , we add a small explicit symmetry breaking term : @xmath23 let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be @xmath26 matrices acting in the @xmath27 space , with @xmath28 generating ordinary isospin rotation around the @xmath29 axis and @xmath30 inducing rotations in the @xmath31 plane .",

    "( [ minimumsigma0 ] ) can now be written as @xmath54 , i.e. for @xmath55 the pions are massless , as required by the goldstone theorem .",
    "in addition to the mass splitting , the shift of the @xmath11 field generates many new vertices , in particular a @xmath56 vertex generated by the interaction lagrangian @xmath57 this leads to the so - called @xmath56 mixing , which is usually eliminated by a redefinition of the @xmath16 field , @xmath58 , followed by a wave - function renormalization of the pion field , @xmath59 , with @xmath60 . as a consequence",
    ", the physical pion mass is increased by @xmath61 , @xmath62 whereas the pion decay constant is reduced by @xmath63 , @xmath64 however , we will choose a different method to treat the @xmath56 mixing , namely summing the self - energy diagrams generated by the @xmath56 vertex to all orders , which gives the same results at tree level , but is more convenient if loop corrections are taken into account . in the next section this will be discussed in more detail .",
    "the properties of the @xmath14 and the @xmath16 are dominated by the decay modes @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding vertex functions within the present model are shown in figs .",
    "[ figgrpp ] and [ figgapr ] .    if the @xmath56 mixing is not eliminated , there are four contributions to the @xmath67 vertex .",
    "the corresponding vertex factors read : @xmath68 the coupling constant @xmath18 can be determined from eqs .",
    "( [ masses0 ] ) and ( [ fpi0 ] ) and the empirical values of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . if we take e.g. @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , we find @xmath75 .",
    "this is more or less the value which is needed to obtain a good description of the @xmath0-meson width and the electromagnetic pion form factor in models without @xmath1-degrees of freedom , where the @xmath67 vertex function consists of diagram ( a ) only ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present model , the second contribution , ( b+c ) , has the same structure as ( a ) and leads to a reduction of the @xmath67 coupling constant by a factor @xmath76 .",
    "however , this is exactly cancelled by the factors @xmath61 assigned to each external pion line if one calculates the decay @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the contributions ( a ) to ( c ) would give a quite good description of the decay @xmath77 with the value @xmath75 determined above .",
    "unfortunately there is still contribution ( d ) , which generates a strong @xmath78-dependence of the vertex function .",
    "this does not only result in a too small width for @xmath77 , but also leads to a wrong shape of the pion electromagnetic form factor or the @xmath79 scattering phase shifts in the @xmath80 channel as a function of @xmath78 , which can perfectly be reproduced without momentum dependence of the vertex .",
    "a similar effect exists for the decay @xmath81 .",
    "due to @xmath56 mixing there are two contributions to the @xmath82 vertex function shown in fig .",
    "[ figgapr ] : @xmath83 again , the term arising from the non - abelian terms in the field strength tensors @xmath84 , @xmath85\\ ] ] causes an additional momentum dependence of the vertex . as a consequence ,",
    "the amplitude for @xmath86 as a function of the invariant mass of the @xmath16 has a zero at @xmath87 .",
    "this lies well below the @xmath2 mass , i.e. within the range where the @xmath16 can experimentally be observed under clean conditions .",
    "the experimental data , however , show no minimum in the @xmath88 invariant mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the problems discussed in the end of the previous section force us to modify the lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ lgauged ] ) . to that end",
    "we relax the constraints imposed by the requirement that the lagrangian ( except for the mass term @xmath89 ) should be invariant under a local @xmath12 transformation and only insist on a global chiral symmetry .",
    "in fact , this has already been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in a less radical way .",
    "two consequences of the gauge principle are incorporated in the lagrangian ( [ lgauged ] ) : first , the same coupling constant @xmath18 appears in different interaction terms , and second , some chirally symmetric interaction terms are not allowed .",
    "for example , the most general interaction of two @xmath42 fields with two @xmath90 fields which is chirally symmetric and has dimension @xmath91 looks as follows : @xmath92 the gauge principle would force us to choose @xmath93 and @xmath94 , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath95 and @xmath96 were chosen as independent parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( with @xmath99 and @xmath100 as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , the problems with the phenomenology of @xmath14 and @xmath16 mesons arise mainly from the vector meson self interaction . however ,",
    "if we are interested only in global chiral symmetry , we can adjust the coupling constants independently : @xmath101    + \\frac{g^{\\prime\\prime\\,2}}{4}\\,{\\mathrm{tr}\\,}y_\\mu y_\\nu\\,[y^\\mu , y^\\nu]\\ , .",
    "\\label{lyyylyyyy}\\ ] ] we are allowed to choose the coupling constants @xmath102 and @xmath103 smaller than @xmath18 or even to put them to zero .",
    "in fact , we perform our calculations with arbitrary values of these coupling constants , and find that the best description of the axial - vector correlator can be achieved with @xmath104 , while our results are insensitive to @xmath103 . for simplicity , we will put both , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , to zero throughout this paper .",
    "in addition to the @xmath103 term , one could think of other chirally symmetric @xmath105-interaction terms of dimension @xmath106 . however , they are not important for our purposes , either .",
    "higher - dimension terms , which are frequently used in the literature @xcite , are much more complicated and result in momentum dependent vertices .",
    "as we will see , the experimental data on @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons can very well be explained without such terms .",
    "this indicates that in nature the momentum dependence of the vertices is small .",
    "besides the interaction terms , we also modify the kinetic term for the vector mesons contained in eq .",
    "( [ lkiny0 ] ) .",
    "with the original kinetic term , the longitudinal part of the vector meson propagator does not go to zero for @xmath107 , causing serious problems if one tries to calculate loop diagrams with vector meson lines . to avoid these problems , we take the stckelberg lagrangian @xcite @xmath108 from this one retrieves the kinetic term of the original lagrangian ( [ lkiny0 ] ) by taking the limit @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath14 meson propagator now has the form @xmath110 this form has the advantage that for @xmath111 the propagator behaves as @xmath112 for @xmath107 , which is not true for @xmath113 .",
    "on the other hand , we have introduced unphysical scalar particles with mass @xmath114 .",
    "this can be interpreted as some form of regularization of the contributions from the longitudinal polarization states of the vector mesons .",
    "therefore the parameter @xmath115 must be chosen small enough , such that all thresholds involving these unphysical particles lie above the energy range we are interested in , because in this case the contributions of the unphysical scalar particles are cancelled by the ghost contributions . ] .    combining everything",
    ", we obtain our full lagrangian : @xmath116    again , as in the previous section , we must shift the @xmath11 field , and eqs .",
    "( [ shiftsigma ] ) and ( [ minimumsigma0 ] ) remain valid . but instead of eq .",
    "( [ masses0 ] ) we find the following expressions for the meson masses : @xmath117 this has the interesting consequence that with a special choice of parameters ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) it is now possible to generate the vector meson masses from chiral symmetry breaking alone . in this case",
    "the masses of both @xmath14 and @xmath16 meson would drop in a nuclear medium where chiral symmetry is ( partially ) restored ( `` brown  rho scaling '' @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath56 mixing lagrangian @xmath120 is still given by eq .",
    "( [ lpia1mix ] ) , but because of the stckelberg ( @xmath115- ) term in the lagrangian it can not be eliminated by a simple field redefinition . instead , self - energy contributions from @xmath120 must be iterated to all orders as shown in fig . [",
    "figpia1mix](a ) .",
    "then the pion propagator can be written as @xmath121 the first pole at @xmath122 corresponds to the physical pion , whereas the second one at @xmath123 corresponds to the unphysical longitudinally polarized @xmath16 particle . in principle",

    "however , the cleanest experimental information about @xmath14 and @xmath16 mesons can be obtained from electromagnetic reactions , @xmath141 , and from the weak decay of the @xmath2 lepton , @xmath142 or @xmath143 .",
    "another reason why we want to include the electromagnetic interactions is of course our interest in dilepton production in heavy ion collisions .    at the quark level",
    "there is no ambiguity how the electromagnetic field and the @xmath144 bosons must be introduced : the ordinary derivative of the quark fields is replaced by a covariant derivative .",
    "if we consider only @xmath145 and @xmath146 quarks ( @xmath147 ) , this looks as follows ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath148 here we have omitted the isoscalar part of the electromagnetic interaction and the @xmath130 boson coupling , since they are irrelevant for our purposes .",
    "this can be generalized to the @xmath27 meson sector .",
    "the isospin operator @xmath149 corresponds to the @xmath24 operator , whereas @xmath150 can be identified with @xmath25 .",
    "therefore all derivatives @xmath151 in the lagrangian ( [ lglobal ] ) have to be replaced by @xmath152 in the last line we have used the abbreviations @xmath153 to find the operators in the vector - meson space corresponding to the @xmath24 and @xmath25 operators in the @xmath27-meson space , we can expand eq .",

    "( [ shiftsigma ] ) .",
    "when we now perform the shift of the @xmath160 field , @xmath161 and @xmath162 couplings emerge . as a consequence",

    "hence , the @xmath164 and @xmath144 fields simply couple to the noether currents .",
    "in addition there are seagull terms involving two @xmath164 or @xmath144 fields . at this stage",
    "there is no direct @xmath165 or @xmath166 coupling in our model .",
    "however , as we will see in sect .",
    "[ sectv1 ] , the @xmath165 and @xmath166 coupling appears naturally at the one - loop level , where we will need a counterterm of the form @xmath167 the @xmath165 part of this term has exactly the form of the @xmath165 coupling of kroll , lee and zumino @xcite , @xmath168 the only difference being that in ref .",
    "@xcite the coupling constant @xmath169 was fixed to @xmath170 , whereas it is a free parameter in our model .",
    "our aim is the chirally symmetric description of the vector isovector and axial - vector isovector correlation functions .",
    "this implies that we need a chirally symmetric description of @xmath14 and @xmath16 mesons . by construction ,",
    "our lagrangian is chirally symmetric , but most approximations beyond tree - level destroy the symmetry .",
    "for example , in the linear @xmath11 model without vector mesons the mean field ( hartree - fock ) approximation violates the goldstone theorem , which can be recovered only if one includes also the rpa corrections @xcite .",
    "then , of course , the self - consistency is lost , i.e. the final rpa mesons are different from the mean - field mesons propagating in the loops .",
    "in fact , a more general investigation of this problem shows that there seems to be no self - consistent approximation scheme which respects the symmetry at the correlator level @xcite .",
    "a simple symmetry conserving approximation scheme is given by a loop expansion , which formally corresponds to an expansion in powers of @xmath171 .",
    "here we will calculate the meson self energies to one - loop order .",
    "this approximation has the following properties :    1 .",
    "the pion remains massless in the chiral limit ( goldstone theorem ) .",
    "2 .   all differences of chiral partners ( @xmath172 and @xmath17 ) disappear when the chiral symmetry is restored ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "3 .   the dominant meson decay modes , such as @xmath65 or @xmath81 ,",
    "are contained in the scheme . of course ,",
    "due to the lack of self - consistency the final decay of the @xmath14 meson in @xmath174 is not included .    of course",
    ", in a strongly interacting theory the loop expansion does not converge .",
    "therefore the model is not defined by its lagrangian alone , but only by the lagrangian together with the approximation scheme used . hence the propagators and vertices obtained from the lagrangian must not be interpreted as elementary , but rather as parametrizations of the full propagators and vertices , containing all non - perturbative effects which are not explicitly taken into account in the approximation scheme .",
    "if one calculates diagrams with loops , one always finds divergent expressions which have to be regularized in some way .",
    "the above mentioned fact , that the vertices and propagators obtained from our lagrangian are not elementary , justifies the introduction of form factors , which are frequently used in the literature in order to cut off high momenta @xcite , rendering the loop integrals finite .",
    "these form factors are independent parameters and can not be computed from the lagrangian .",
    "unfortunately we can not simply attach form factors to the vertices obtained from our lagrangian , since this would destroy the symmetry properties of our model .",
    "other regularization prescriptions , which can be found in the literature , are the pauli - villars scheme with finite regulator mass @xcite or subtracted dispersion relations . using these prescriptions",
    "one can sometimes avoid the problems arising from form factors , although they give very similar results .",
    "as an example consider the self - energy @xmath175 , describing the decay of the @xmath14 meson into two pions , with a three dimensional form factor @xmath176 attached to each @xmath177 vertex , which cuts off pion momenta @xmath178 ( measured in the @xmath14-meson rest frame ) at some value @xmath179",
    ". for small @xmath14-meson energies , @xmath180 , the imaginary part of @xmath175 is not modified by the form factor . for the real part",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "since it is related to the imaginary part via a dispersion integral , it receives already for low @xmath78 contributions from the imaginary part at high @xmath78 .",
    "therefore it depends strongly on @xmath179 .",
    "however , using subtracted dispersion relations , one can easily convince oneself that for low energies the influence of the form factor on the real part can approximately be absorbed in the subtraction constants , while the remaining dispersion integral is almost independent of the form factor .    in this sense , subtracted dispersion relations can be interpreted as an approximate way of attaching form factors to the vertices . as",
    "the subtraction constants depend on the high - energy behavior of the form factors , they can not be calculated from the lagrangian , but they are free parameters",
    ". however , there are some contraints which follow from chiral symmetry . in order to preserve the symmetry",
    ", we must make equal subtractions from the self energies of chiral partners .",
    "obviously this is mathematically ill - defined , since the subtractions are infinite .",
    "therefore we need a more systematic method to ensure the consistency of the subtractions .",
    "the subtractions can be regarded as ( infinite ) counterterms added to the original lagrangian .",
    "thus the subtractions are consistent with chiral symmetry if the counterterms are chirally invariant .",
    "the values of the counterterms are determined as follows @xcite .",
    "first we calculate the self - energy diagrams with dimensional regularization , i.e. we calculate the loop integrals in @xmath146 space - time dimensions , @xmath181 if we expand the result in the vicinity of @xmath182 , the divergences appear as poles @xmath183 .",

    "in fact , it is not visible in the figure since it is about a factor @xmath387 smaller than the first contribution . to be more quantitative ,",
    "we integrate the strength of @xmath386 up to @xmath388 . with the parameters of",
    "fit a we find @xmath389 , which has to be compared with the strength @xmath390 of the single - pion contribution .    the smallness of @xmath386 is a manifestation of the pcac hypothesis . usually the pcac hypothesis is formulated as @xmath391 .",
    "however , beyond tree level this is almost meaningless , since the field operator @xmath392 has non - vanishing matrix elements @xmath393 not only for single - pion states @xmath394 , but also for multi - particle states , e.g. in our model for @xmath330 , @xmath88 , @xmath395 and @xmath396 states .",
    "in fact , as pointed out by weinberg @xcite , the pcac assumption should be interpreted in a different way , namely that @xmath386 , which is directly related to the multi - particle content of @xmath397 , is negligible .",
    "obviously this is fulfilled very well in our model .",
    "we have presented a chirally symmetric hadronic model for the vector and axial - vector correlators in vacuum .",
    "the starting point was the linear @xmath160 model extended by @xmath0-meson and @xmath1 fields in a chirally symmetric way .",
    "unlike the gauged linear @xmath160 model , which leads to phenomenological difficulties ( see sect . [ sectlgauged ] ) , our lagrangian is only symmetric under global , but not under local @xmath12 transformations .",
    "after all , chiral symmetry is also only an ( approximate ) global symmetry in qcd .    for a realistic description of @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "we could not stay at tree - level , where all mesons are stable particles . in order to include the most important decay channels , @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", we performed a one - loop calculation . here",
    "care had to be exercised , not to destroy the symmetries of the model by choosing an unsuited regularization scheme .",
    "we have decided to use dimensional regularization in order to isolate the divergences , which are then subtracted by chirally symmetric counterterms .    the price to pay for giving up the requirement of a local chiral symmetry",
    "is the loss of the so - called current - field identity which directly relates the vector and axial - vector currents to the meson fields .",
    "therefore some additional work was needed to construct the correlators in a consistent way .    in the last part of the paper we have presented numerical results .",
    "we have fixed our parameters to reproduce the empirical values of @xmath411 and @xmath69 and the peak regions of the vector and axial vector spectral functions , which have been extracted by the aleph collaboration from the @xmath2 decay .",
    "basically , this leaves two parameters undetermined , namely the mass of the @xmath160-meson , which is not a well established resonance in nature , and the mass parameter @xmath322 .",
    "the latter is the fraction of the bare @xmath0-meson mass which is not proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath160 field , i.e. the fraction which would survive in the restored phase . from our fit",
    "we only found an upper limit of @xmath412 for @xmath322 . on the other hand ,",
    "a particularly interesting case is @xmath329 , which corresponds to a vanishing bare vector meson mass in the restored phase ( `` brown - rho scenario '' ) .",
    "therefore , we have performed calculations with @xmath329 and with @xmath333 , both for two different @xmath11-meson masses , @xmath413 and @xmath414 .",
    "all fits describe the peak regions of the experimental spectral functions equally well and also give a satisfactory description of the pion electromagnetic form factor , the @xmath415 phase shifts in the vector - isovector channel , and the @xmath381 and @xmath378 mass distributions for the decay @xmath416 . at higher energies , @xmath417 in the vector channel and @xmath418 in the transverse axial - vector channel our fits",
    "underestimate the empirical spectral functions . in these regions",
    "four - pion ( vector channel ) or five - pion ( axial - vector channel ) final states become relevant , which are not properly contained in our one - loop calculation .",
    "the longitudinal axial correlator is completely dominated by the pion pole , in agreement with the pcac hypothesis .",
    "the remaining strength , which is due to the small explicit breaking of chiral symmetry in our lagrangian , is the result of a delicate cancellation of three terms which are four orders of magnitude larger than their sum .",
    "this nicely demonstrates the consistency of our model with chiral symmetry as well as the stability of the numerics .    in the present paper",
    "we have restricted ourselves to vacuum properties . however , having the technology developed , it is now straightforward to calculate the correlators at finite temperatures",
    ". work in this direction is in progress .",

    "<S> we present a chirally symmetric hadronic model for the vector and axial - vector correlators in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contributions to these correlators come from intermediate pions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons which are calculated in one - loop approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spectral functions are compared with the data obtained by the aleph collaboration from @xmath2 decay . in the vector channel </S>",
    "<S> we find good agreement up to @xmath3 , in the transverse axial - vector channel up to @xmath4 , corresponding to the regimes dominated by two - pion or three - pion decay channels , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal axial correlator is in almost perfect agreement with the pcac result .    </S>",
