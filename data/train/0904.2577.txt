    "while analytic solutions for isolated black holes ( bhs ) have a long history , the dynamics of bh binaries has been solved only recently and through computationally - expensive numerical - relativity ( nr ) calculations [ see  @xcite for a review ] . despite the mathematical complexity of the problem",
    ", many results of the nr simulations can be reproduced accurately using semi - analytical prescriptions  @xcite based on post - newtonian ( pn ) and bh perturbation theory .",
    "it is therefore not entirely surprising that the dimensionless spin of the remnant from a bh - binary merger , @xmath0 , can be described , with increasing accuracy , via simple prescriptions based on point particles  @xcite , on fits to the nr data  @xcite , or on a combination of the two approaches  @xcite [ see  @xcite for a review ] .",
    "these formulas are useful because they provide information over the entire 7-dimensional parameter space for bh binaries in quasi - circular orbits , namely : the mass ratio @xmath1 and the six components of the initial dimensionless spin vectors @xmath2 .",
    "such parameter space could in principle be investigated entirely via nr calculations ; in practice , however , the simulations are still very expensive and restricted to @xmath3@xmath4 . also , these formulas have many applications : in astrophysics , where they could provide information on massive star binaries  @xcite ; in cosmology , where supermassive bhs ( smbhs ) are believed to assemble through accretion and mergers  @xcite ; in gravitational - wave astronomy , where _ a priori _ knowledge of the final spin can help the detection  @xcite .",
    "while the different expressions for the spin norm , @xmath5 , are in good agreement among themselves and with the numerical data , the predictions for the final - spin direction , @xmath6 , do not agree well with one another .",
    "moreover , all expressions are built from and model the typical `` nr binaries '' and hence the dynamics of the last few orbits before the merger , and do not account systematically for the precession of the orbital angular momentum @xmath7 , thus becoming imprecise when the binary is widely separated  @xcite .",
    "of course , it is possible to use the pn equations and evolve a widely - separated binary to small separations , read - off the relevant information and apply the presently - available formulas [ this was suggested by  @xcite , who correctly remark that their expression is valid only at small separations ] . while not a problem in principle , this procedure can be impractical in applications , such as cosmological merger - trees or n - body simulations , that provide the spins of the two bhs at separations of hundreds or thousands of gravitational radii .",
    "we follow here a different approach , and using assumptions slightly different from those made in  @xcite , we present a new expression for @xmath8 which is applicable to binaries with arbitrary separations and which also provides better results for the final - spin direction at small separations .",
    "we recall that when the bhs have spins that are aligned with @xmath7 , the nr results are accurately described by  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the symmetric mass ratio and @xmath11 .",
    "the five coefficients @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 in   can be determined straightforwardly by fitting the results of the nr calculations .",
    "however , an additional condition can be employed by using the results obtained by  @xcite for equal - mass non - spinning bhs and thus enforce that for @xmath17 and to the claimed precision @xmath18 this leaves only _ four _ unconstrained coefficients , so that by using the nr results for the 72 _ aligned _ binaries published so far  @xcite we obtain @xmath19 with an agreement @xmath20 with the data . ] ; using the constraint ( 2 ) we then also obtain @xmath21 . because of the larger data set used , the values   are slightly different from those in  @xcite .",
    "because   provides information over only 3 of the 7 dimensions of the parameter space , we will next show how to cover the remaining 4 dimensions and thus derive an expression for @xmath8 for _ generic _ bh binaries in quasi - circular orbits . following the spirit of  @xcite",
    ", we make the following assumptions :    _ ( i ) the mass @xmath22 radiated to gravitational waves can be neglected _ _",
    "i.e. , _  @xmath23 .",
    "the radiated mass could be accounted for by using the nr data for @xmath24  @xcite or extrapolating the test - particle behavior  @xcite .",
    "the reason why assumption _ ( i ) _ is reasonable is that @xmath22 is largest for aligned binaries , but these are also the ones employed to fit the free coefficients  .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 is approximately accounted for by the values of the coefficients .    _",
    "( ii ) the norms @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 do not depend on the binary s separation @xmath28 _ , with @xmath29 being defined as @xmath30= \\boldsymbol{l}(r)-\\boldsymbol{j}_{\\rm rad}(r)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the spins and the orbital angular momentum at separation @xmath28 and @xmath34 is the angular momentum radiated from @xmath28 to the merger .",
    "clearly , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath29 can still depend on @xmath28 through their directions . while the constancy of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a very good assumption for bhs , which do not have an internal structure ,",
    "the constancy of @xmath27 is more heuristic and based on the idea that the merger takes place at an `` effective '' innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , so that @xmath27 can be interpreted as the residual orbital angular momentum contributing to @xmath37 .    _",
    "( iii ) the final spin @xmath37 is parallel to the initial total angular momentum @xmath38 .",
    "_ this amounts to assuming that @xmath39 .",
    "it replaces the assumption , made in  @xcite , that @xmath40 , which is only valid for a smaller set of configurations .",
    "we note that this assumption is motivated by pn theory : within the adiabatic approximation , the secular angular - momentum losses via gravitational radiation are along @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "this is because as @xmath7 rotates around @xmath41 , the emission orthogonal to @xmath41 averages out .    _",
    "( iv ) the angle between @xmath7 and @xmath42 and the angle between @xmath35 and @xmath35 are constant during the inspiral , although @xmath7 and @xmath43 precess around @xmath41 .",
    "_    at 2.5 pn order , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are approximately valid for any mass ratio if only one of the bhs is spinning , and for @xmath46 if one neglects spin - spin couplings . in both cases , in fact , @xmath43 and @xmath7 essentially precess around the direction @xmath47 , which remains nearly constant  @xcite , and the angle between the two spins remains constant as well .",
    "the only case in which @xmath44 and @xmath45 are not even approximately valid is for binaries which , at some point in the evolution , have @xmath48 .",
    "these orbits undergo the so - called `` transitional precession ''  @xcite , as a result of which @xmath47 changes significantly .",
    "because transitional precession happens only if @xmath7 and @xmath43 are initially _ almost _ anti - aligned with @xmath49 , it affects only a very small region of the parameter space , which is , moreover , poorly populated if the smbhs are in a gas - rich environment  @xcite .    because assumption _ ( iii ) _ plays a major role in our analysis , in fig .",
    "[ fig : test_assumption3 ] we provide evidence of its ( approximate ) validity by using all the _ generic _ bh - binary simulations ( _ i.e. , _  with spins _ not _ parallel to @xmath7 ) published so far  @xcite , except two binaries in  @xcite , which , when reproduced by us , seem affected by imprecisions ( m.  jasiulek 2009 , private communication ) . in particular , we plot the angle between @xmath37 and @xmath50 as a function of the spin - spin coupling `` magnitude '' @xmath51 for the binaries with @xmath52 ( lower panel ) , and of @xmath53 for the binaries with @xmath54 ( upper panel ) . clearly , assumption _ ( iii ) _ is valid to within @xmath55 degrees , with maximum errors of @xmath56 degrees .",
    "these errors are compatible with the accuracy with which the nr simulations can compute the final - spin direction for strongly precessing binaries ( _ cf . _",
    "the error s noisy dependence on @xmath51 ) .    _",
    "( v ) when the initial spin vectors are equal and opposite and the masses are equal , the spin of the final bh is the same as for nonspinning binaries_. besides being physically reasonable  reflecting the expectation that if the spins are equal and opposite , their contributions cancel out  this assumption is confirmed by nr simulations [ _ c.f .",
    "_  discussion in  @xcite ] and by the leading - order pn spin - spin and spin - orbit couplings .    with these assumptions ,",
    "we derive an expression for the final spin .",
    "let us write  , using _",
    "( i ) _ , as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 . using _",
    "( ii ) _ , the final - spin norm is @xmath60^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are @xmath63 note that because of @xmath45 @xmath64 does not depend on the separation and is simply the angle between the spins at the _ initial _ separation @xmath65 .",
    "the angles @xmath66 and @xmath62 are instead functions of the binary s separation , but this dependence cancels out in the linear combination in which they appear in  , which is indeed , within the assumptions made , independent of the separation and which can therefore be evaluated at @xmath67 . to see this , let us consider expression   at the effective isco .",
    "there , @xmath68 by definition and therefore @xmath69 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath70 [ @xmath71 are simply the angles between @xmath35 [ @xmath36 ] and @xmath7 at the isco .",
    "using now assumption @xmath45 , we can write part of   as @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the angles between the spins and @xmath7 at _ any separation _ @xmath28 and thus also at @xmath67 @xmath76    this proves our previous statement : the dependence on @xmath28 that @xmath66 and @xmath62 have in expression   is canceled by the linear combination in which they appear .",
    "stated differently , the final - spin norm is simply given by expression   where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus , one does not need to worry about the angles between @xmath79 and @xmath80 but simply about the angles between @xmath79 and @xmath81 at @xmath67 , which are easy to compute .",
    "finally , we need to compute @xmath82 and for this we proceed like in @xcite and match expression   at @xmath83 with   for parallel and aligned spins [ @xmath84 , for parallel and antialigned spins [ @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and for antiparallel spins which are aligned or antialigned [ @xmath87 , @xmath88 or @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , this matching is not unique , but the degeneracy can be broken by exploiting assumption _ ( v ) _ ( _ i.e. , _  by imposing that @xmath91 does not depend on @xmath92 when @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) and by requiring for simplicity that @xmath91 depends linearly on @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . using these constraints and",
    "we obtain again an expression valid for _ any separation _ and hence for @xmath67 @xmath98    when comparing  ,   and   with ( 8) and ( 11 ) of  @xcite , it is straightforward to realize that they are mathematically the same , although derived under a different ( and improved ) set of assumptions .",
    "this is simply because the new assumptions _",
    "( ii ) _ and _ ( iv ) _ are compatible , via equation  , with the old ones . however",
    ", the new assumptions make a substantial difference in the prediction of the final - spin _ direction_. since _ ( iii ) _ states that @xmath99 , the angle @xmath100 between the final spin and the initial orbital angular momentum @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 this expression replaces and improves  ( 10 ) of  @xcite and , as we will show , is verified both for initial separations of a few gravitational radii , such as those considered in nr , and for larger separations ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath103 ) , which are relevant for cosmological applications .    1.0 cm    1.0 cm",
    "we now test our expressions  ,   and   for @xmath5 and our expression   for @xmath100 against the nr simulations published so far for _ generic _ binaries .",
    "note that to test the expression for @xmath100 we use the same simulations as in fig .",
    "[ fig : test_assumption3 ] [ _ i.e. ,",
    "_  @xcite ] , while to test the expression for @xmath5 we also use the data of  @xcite ( which only reports the final - spin norm ) . also , we compare our predictions ( aei ) with those of similar formulas suggested by  @xcite ( bkl ) ,  @xcite ( @xmath104 ) and  @xcite ( fau ) .",
    "the comparison consists of two steps .",
    "first , we use as input the initial data of the nr simulations , in which the binaries have _ small separations _ ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath105 ) .",
    "second , we use binaries at _ large separations _ ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath106 ) , for which the dynamics starts being dominated by gravitational - wave emission and which are therefore of direct relevance for cosmological investigations . more precisely , we evolve the nr initial configurations back in time up to a separation of @xmath107 using the 2.5 pn equations in the quasi - circular limit  @xcite , calculating the predictions of the different formulas at each step and considering the maximum error for each formula .",
    "( we stress , however , that the figures we present do not change significantly if we integrate only up to a separation of @xmath108 . )    the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : afin ] shows the predictions of the various formulas for @xmath109 , when applied to the small - separation configurations corresponding to the initial data of the nr simulations . in particular , it reports the error in the final - spin norm @xmath110  where `` * '' stands for `` aei '' ( which , as already stressed , gives the same predictions for @xmath109 as `` @xmath104 '' ) , `` fau '' or `` bkl ''  as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "the right panel shows instead the _ maximum _ error when the configurations are evolved back in time up to @xmath111 .",
    "[ fig : afin ] clearly shows that although the aei expression is slightly better , one _ can _ apply the old formulas to widely - separated binaries _ if _ the focus is on @xmath5 only . note that the larger errors for small @xmath53 are most likely due to the larger truncation errors affecting those simulations",
    "[ see  @xcite , sec .",
    "iiia ] .    however , the situation is very different for the final - spin _ direction_. in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig : thetafin ] reports the inclination - angle error @xmath112}\\vert$ ] , for all the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : afin ] , except those of  @xcite , for which the final - spin direction was not published .",
    "when considering small - separation binaries ( left panel ) , our new formula performs slightly better than the `` bkl '' and `` @xmath104 '' formulas , but it is not better than the `` fau '' one .",
    "indeed , the latter is exact by construction for the 32 binaries of table ii in  @xcite , because for such data the final - spin direction was not published and has been here reconstructed using the fau formula .",
    "when applied to large - separation binaries ( right panel ) , however , our new formula performs much better than the other ones .",
    "this result is not surprising since all the previous formulas predict the same value of @xmath100 for all @xmath65 , as they neglect the precession of the binary s orbital plane . as suggested by  @xcite",
    ", one can in principle use pn theory to integrate the binary to small separations , and then apply the old formulas . as already mentioned , however , this is impractical , compared to our simple and algebraic expressions for the final spin .",
    "also , note that the error in @xmath100 made by the previous formulas at large separations increases for small-@xmath53 binaries .",
    "this is again because the previous formulas predict the same @xmath100 for all @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , because the correct @xmath100 becomes small for large @xmath65 [ since @xmath113 , the maximum error of the previous formulas is roughly given by their prediction for @xmath100 at small separations , which can be large for small @xmath53 if the angle between @xmath114 and @xmath115 at small separations is large [ because for @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the very small errors in the predictions of the final - spin direction also provide additional evidence , besides that in fig .",
    "[ fig : test_assumption3 ] , of the validity of assumption _ ( iii ) _ , namely that @xmath119 . also , they suggest a correlation between the final - spin direction and the orbital plane when the binary was widely separated . stated differently , by observing @xmath120 , _",
    "e.g. , _  via a jet if this is assumed along @xmath120 , one is virtually `` observing '' @xmath121 and can conclude that the orbital plane at large separations was roughly orthogonal to the final spin .",
    "our result could therefore be applied to x - shaped radio sources , for which the origin of the double pair of jets is under debate  @xcite .",
    "we have derived a new formula predicting the spin of the bh resulting from the merger of two bhs in quasi - circular orbits and having arbitrary initial masses and spins .",
    "our derivation is based on a revised set of assumptions and exploits an additional constraint to reduce to only _ four _ the number of undetermined coefficients .",
    "the new formula is identical to that proposed in  @xcite in the prediction of the final - spin _ norm _ , but is different in the prediction of its _ direction _ , showing a much better agreement with the numerical data .",
    "the new formula can be applied to binaries with separations larger than @xmath122 _ without _ any preliminary integration of the pn equations , in contrast with what would be needed by the other formulas proposed in the literature .",
    "thus , our formula is particularly suitable for astrophysical and cosmological applications and could provide clues about the relation between the spin of the smbh in the center of agns and the binary s orbital plane well before the merger .",
