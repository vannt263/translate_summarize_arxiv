    "the electron properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphene , a single - layer carbon sheet , has attracted much attention by both theoreticians and experimentalists ( see @xcite and references therein ) . along with this related structures , namely graphene nanoribbons ,",
    "are also under intensive investigation @xcite .",
    "one of the reason for this is that the long electron mean free path in graphene up to 1@xmath0 m opens a field of carbon - based nanoelectronics , where gnrs are used as interconnects in nanodevices .",
    "the unique electron mobility in graphene structures is caused by the strong bonding between the carbon atoms in the honeycomb lattice of graphene .",
    "this in turn prevents the replacing of the carbon atoms by alien ones .",
    "nevertheless , graphene is not immune to extrinsic disorder and its transport properties @xcite are very sensitive to impurities and defects @xcite .",
    "the theoretical problem of an impurity in 2d graphene was considered originally in @xcite . in the vicinity of the dirac points in @xmath1 space , which are peaks of the double cones of the fermi surface , the low - energy electronic excitations in gapless graphene are described by the equation of the effective mass approximation , which is formally identical to the 2d dirac equation for a massless neutrino , having the fermi speed @xmath2 . in the presence of an attractive impurity centre of charge @xmath3 screened by a medium of the effective dielectric constant @xmath4 the electron states are drastically different for the subcritical @xmath5 and supercritical @xmath6 regions of the strength of the coulomb interaction , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the 2d momentum of the impurity electron and that , having the speed @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "clearly , the super- and subcritical regimes can be reached for the dimensionless coulomb potential strength @xmath10 for @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the difference of the subcritical and supercritical electron states is caused by their different behaviour in the vicinity of the impurity centre @xmath12 .",
    "the subcritical regime admits regular solutions to the dirac equations , while the wave functions corresponding to the supercritical case oscillate and do not have any definite limit .",
    "the physical reason for this is that at the subcritical strengths @xmath13 the centrifugal potential barrier prevents the electron `` fall to the centre '' @xcite , while the supercritical strengths @xmath14 provide the collapse .",
    "clearly , the continuum approach based on the dirac formalism becomes inapplicable .",
    "the lattice - scale physics dominates that in turn requires a regularization procedure , namely the cutoff of the coulomb potential at short distances @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the c - c distance in graphene .",
    "the physics of the supercritical impurity electron in graphene @xcite closely resembles that of the relativistic electron in an atom having the nuclear charge @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "since , as it follows from below , only the supercritical regime is relevant to the impurity state in gnr , we focus on this case .",
    "numerical and analytical approaches developed on the tight - binding model of the graphene lattice and of the dirac equation , subject to the regularization procedure , respectively , undertaken originally by pereira @xcite et.al .",
    "have revealed the infinite number of the quasi - bound states , having the finite width , arising , as it was shown quasi - classically @xcite , from the collapsed states . if the requirement of the regularity of the wave functions in the vicinity of the source of the electron attraction is to be replaced by the less rigorous condition of its square integrability an infinite number of the strictly discrete energy levels were found to occur .",
    "the coulomb potential cutoff in the gapped @xcite and no cutoff in the gapless graphene @xcite induce the energy series bounded and unbounded from below , respectively .    in the gnr , which in principle can be treated as a quasi-1d structure",
    ", we can expect completely different results .",
    "the strictly discrete bound states regular at the impurity centre @xmath18 are realized without the regularization procedure , in particular without the cutoff of the coulomb potential , preventing the collapse .",
    "consequential concerns lie in the well known fact that the reduction of the dimension of the structure increases the stability of the impurity electron . in units of the impurity",
    "rydberg constant @xmath19 the binding energy @xmath20 of the impurity electron in 3d bulk material is @xmath21 , in the narrow 2d quantum well @xmath22 @xcite , and in the thin quantum wire of radius @xmath23 much less than the impurity bohr radius @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xcite . besides , an extremely weak 3d atomic potential not providing bound electron states , transforms in the presence of a magnetic field into a quasi-1d system binding the electron @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to note that these atomic states arise under as weak as one likes magnetic fields i.e. the as large as one likes magnetic lengths playing the same role as the width of the gnr .",
    "note that the confinement attributed to the semiconductor thin films @xcite replaces the 3d coulomb potential @xmath26 by the effective 2d potential of the weaker singularity of the logarithmic character .",
    "it seems that in the quasi-1d gnr the effect of the attenuation of the potential singularity preventing the fall to the centre exceeds that of the vanishing of the 2d centrifugal potential barrier promoting the collapse .    clearly",
    "a study of the impurity electron state in graphene structures is important on account of two reasons .",
    "first , these structures provide a realization in solid state physics of remarkable effects of quantum electrodynamics caused by a large `` fine structure constant '' @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "second , we expect a strong impact of impurities on the electronic systems not only for 2d graphene layers possessing an outstanding high electron mobility @xcite but in particular for impurity gnrs whose properties are not widely addressed in the literature yet .",
    "brey and fertig @xcite have shown that the energy spectrum of the electron in an armchair gnr bounded in @xmath28-direction is the sequence of the subbands formed by the branches of the continuous energies of the longitudinal unbounded @xmath29-motion emanating from the size - quantized energy levels @xmath30 , ( @xmath31 is the discrete lable ) , reflecting the ribbons @xmath28-confinement .",
    "the equation for the components @xmath32 of the dirac spinor relevant to the a and b sublattices of the graphene for the electron positioned far away from the impurity centre has the form    @xmath33 showing that the armchair gnr manifests itself as gapped structure entailing the bound and unbound impurity states for the energies @xmath34 , respectively .    of special interest",
    "is the narrow gnr of width @xmath35 for which @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the radius of the bound electron state , being induced by the ribbon confinement @xmath35 .",
    "such a gnr provides the expected electron binding energy @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a some function vanishing at @xmath40 , which is of interest and attractive because of two aspects . on the one hand the ribbon provides a considerable impurity binding energy which could be measured experimentally and on the other hand the impurity potential can be treated perturbatively and an analytical approach to the problem becomes feasible .",

    "a comment concerning the from of the energy spectrum is in order . in the zeroth approximation of isolated size - quantized @xmath31-subbands",
    "i.e. in the single - subband approximation the slow longitudinal motion parallel to the boundaries is governed by the 2d coulomb potential averaged with respect to the `` fast '' transverse @xmath31-states .",
    "the energy spectrum consists of sequence of series of quasi - coulomb discrete @xmath49-levels and continuous sub - bands positioned below and above , respectively relatively to the size - quantized energy levels @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . only the series of the impurity energy levels @xmath50 adjacent to the ground size - quantized energy level @xmath51 is strictly discrete .",
    "the @xmath49-series adjacent to the excited levels @xmath52 come into resonance with the states of the continuous spectra of lower subbands and in fact in the next multi - subband approximation turn into quasi - discrete resonant states ( fano resonances)@xcite .",
    "the corresponding resonant widths @xmath53 determine the auto - ionization rate and life - time @xmath54 of the resonant impurity states being of relevance to an experimental study . also to our knowledge",
    "an analytical approach to the problem of impurities in gnr providing the explicit dependencies of both discrete and especially quasi - discrete electron states on the width of the gnr @xmath55 and the position of the impurity centre within the gnr are not comprehensively available in the literature .    in order to fill the above",
    "mentioned gap we perform an analytical study of the strictly discrete and resonant impurity states in a narrow armchair gnr . the impurity centre is positioned anywhere within the ribbon bound by the impenetrable boundaries .",
    "the width of the gnr is assumed to be much less than the radius of the impurity state .",
    "the complete 2d envelope wave function satisfying the massless dirac equation is expanded with respect to the basis formed by the 1d size - quantized subband wave functions describing the fast transverse motion bound by the boundaries of the gnr .",
    "the generated set of equations for the 1d quasi - coulomb wave functions relevant to the longitudinal slow motion is solved in the single- , two- and three - subband approximations , in which the ground , first and second excited subbands are involved .",
    "the mathematical method is based on the matching of the coulomb wave functions with those obtained by an iteration procedure at any point within the intermediate region bound by the ribbon width and the radius of the created coulomb state .",
    "both the real and imaginary parts of the complex energy levels are calculated in a single procedure .",
    "the dependencies of the binding energy and resonant energy shift and width on the width of the gnr and the position of the impurity centre are obtained in an explicit form .",
    "numerical estimates show that for a narrow gnr the binding energy and the resonant width are quite reasonable , to render the impurity electron states in gnr experimentally observable .",
    "our analytical results are in line with those calculated numerically and revealed in an experiment .",
    "we remark that our aim is to elucidate the physics of the impurity states in gnr by deriving closed form analytical expressions for their properties .",
    "we do not intend to compete with the results of computational studies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the analytical approach based on the multi - subband approximation",
    "is described .",
    "the real quasi - coulomb functions of the discrete and continuous spectrum and the real energy levels determining the binding energies are calculated in the single - subband approximation in section 3 .",
    "the complex energies including the resonant shift and width associated to the first and second excited subbands are found in the double and three - subband approximation , respectively , in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss the obtained results .",
    "section 6 contains the conclusions .",
    "according to the above an analytical description of the stable and metastable impurity electron states in the narrow armchair gnr is of significant interest .",
    "it elucidates the underlying basic physics of the carbon - based nanodevices , in which the highly mobile electrons remain unbound in the 2d graphene monolayers while in their interconnects , namely in quasi-1d armchair gnrs these electrons are trapped by impurity centres .",
    "the latter could modify the overall transport properties .",
