    "magnetic domain wall ( dw ) motion along a nanowire underpins many proposals of spintronic devices @xcite .",
    "high dw propagation velocity is obviously important because it determines the device speed . in current - driven dw propagation",
    ", many efforts have been devoted to high dw velocity and low current density in order to optimize device performance .",
    "the issue of whether notches can enhance current - induced dw propagation is investigated here .",
    "traditionally , notches are used to locate dw positions @xcite .",
    "common wisdom expects notches to strengthen dw pinning and to hinder dw motion .",
    "indeed , in the field - driven dw propagation , intentionally created roughness slows down dw propagation although they can increase the walker breakdown field @xcite . unlike the energy - dissipation mechanism of field - induced dw motion @xcite , spin - transfer torque ( stt ) @xcite is the driven force behind the current - driven dw motion .",
    "the torque consists of an adiabatic stt and a much smaller non - adiabatic stt @xcite . in the absence of the non - adiabatic stt",
    ", there exists an intrinsic pinning even in a homogeneous wire , below which a sustainable dw motion is not possible @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there are indications @xcite that the depinning current density of a dw trapped in a notch is smaller than the intrinsic threshold current density in the absence of the non - adiabatic stt .",
    "although there is no intrinsic pinning @xcite in the presence of a non - adiabatic stt , it is interesting to ask whether notches can boost dw propagation in the presence of both adiabatic stt and non - adiabatic stt .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically study how dw propagates along notch - modulated nanowires .",
    "three phases are identified : pinning phase when current density is below depinning current density @xmath3 ; boosting phase and hindering phase when the current density is above @xmath3 and the non - adiabatic stt strength @xmath0 is smaller or larger than the gilbert damping constant @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the average dw velocity in boosting and hindering phases is respectively higher and lower than that in the wire without notches .",
    "it is found that dw depinning is facilitated by antivortex nucleation . in the case of @xmath4 ,",
    "the antivortex generation is responsible for velocity boost because vortices move faster than transverse walls . in the other case of @xmath5 , the longitudinal velocity of",
    "a vortex / antivortex is slower than that of a transverse wall in a homogeneous wall and notches hinder dw propagation .",
    "we consider sufficient long wires ( with at least 8 notches ) of various thickness and width .",
    "it is well known that @xcite narrow wires favor only transverse walls while wide wires prefer vortex walls .",
    "transverse walls are the main subjects of this study . a series of identical triangular notches of depth @xmath6 and width @xmath7 are placed evenly and alternately on the two sides of the nanowires as shown in fig . [ fig1]a with a typical clockwise transverse wall pinned at the center of the first notch .",
    "the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10axis are along length , width , and thickness directions , respectively .",
    "the magnetization dynamics of the wire is governed by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 are respectively the unit vector of local magnetization , the gyromagnetic ratio , the effective field including exchange and anisotropy fields , and the gilbert damping constant .",

    "for permalloy of @xmath22 a / m , @xmath23 m / s corresponds to @xmath24 . in this study",
    ", @xmath25 is limited to be smaller than both 850 m / s ( corresponding to @xmath26 ! ) and the walker breakdown current density because current density above the values generates intensive spin waves around dws and notches , which makes dw motion too complicated to be even described .",
    "dimensionless quantity @xmath0 measures the strength of non - adiabatic stt and whether @xmath0 is larger or smaller than @xmath1 is still in debate @xcite .",

    "results presented below are on a wire of 64 nm wide and notches of @xmath36 nm .",
    "three phases can be identified .",
    "a dw is pinned at a notch when @xmath25 is below a depinning current density @xmath3 .",
    "this pinning phase is denoted as a ( green region ) in fig",
    "surprisingly , @xmath3 increases slightly with @xmath0 , indicating that the @xmath0-term actually hinders dw depinning out of a notch although it is responsible for the absence of the intrinsic pinning in a uniform wire ( see discussion below for possible cause ) .",
    "when @xmath25 is above @xmath3 , a dw starts to propagate and it can either be faster or slower than the dw velocity in the corresponding uniform wire , depending on relative values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    when @xmath38 , dw velocity is boosted through antivortex generation at notches .",
    "this phase is denoted as phase b. when @xmath2 , the boosting of dw propagation is suppressed no matter vortices are generated ( phase c1 ) or not ( phase c2 ) .",
    "the upper bound of the phase plane is determined by the walker breakdown current density and @xmath39 m / s .",
    "if the current density is larger than the upper bound , spin waves emission from dw @xcite and notches are so strong that new dws may be created .",
    "also , the walker breakdown is smaller than the depinning value @xmath3 for @xmath40 .",
    "thus the phase plane in fig .",

    "right after the current is turned on at @xmath59 ns , the instantaneous dw velocity is very low until an antivortex of winding number @xmath60 @xcite is generated near the notch edge at 0.5 ns ( see discussion and fig .",
    "9 below ) .",
    "the motion of the antivortex core drags the whole dw to propagate forward at a velocity around 600 m / s .",
    "the antivortex core annihilates itself at the bottom edge of the wire after traveling about 1.5 @xmath55 m and the initial transverse wall reverses its chirality at the same time @xcite .",

    "moreover , the transverse wall keeps its original chirality unchanged when the antivortex is annihilated at wire edge , and no vortex / antivortex is generated at the second notch .",

    "the vortex core in this structure boosts dw velocity above the average dw velocity of a uniform wire .",
    "this finding may also explain a surprising observation in an early experiment @xcite that depinning current does not depend on dw types .",
    "a vortex wall under a current transforms into a transverse wall before depinning from a notch . thus both vortex wall and transverse wall",

    "adiabatic spin transfer torque tends to rotate the spins at the edge defect near a notch out of plane and to form a vortex / antivortex core .",
    "thus , any mechanisms that help ( hinder ) the creation of a vortex / antivortex core shall decrease ( increase ) the depinning current density @xmath3 .",
    "to test this hypothesis , we use a magnetic field pulse of 0.4 ns along @xmath96direction ( shown in the inset of fig . [",

    "( 3 ) ( for @xmath132 ) is @xmath47 , the same as the transverse dw velocity in a homogeneous wire ( straight lines in figs .",

    "the first term depends on dw properties as well as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it changes sign at @xmath133 .",
    "@xmath132 is larger than @xmath47 in the presence of vortices if @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , in this case vortex generations and vortex dynamics boost dw propagation . for small @xmath1 and to the leading order correction in @xmath1 and @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( 3 ) becomes @xmath134 .",
    "thus , the longitudinal velocity equals approximately @xmath25 and depends very weakly on @xmath0 .",

    "@xmath135 corresponds to the complete conversion of itinerant electron spins into local magnetic moments .",
    "although the thiele equation can not explain why a dw generates vortices around notches in phase b , it explains well dw propagation boost for @xmath4 .",
    "this result is in contrast to the field - driven dw propagation where vortex / antivortex generation reduces the walker breakdown field and inevitably slows down dw motion @xcite .    before conclusion",
    ", we would also like to point out that it is possible to realize both @xmath4 ( boosting phase ) and @xmath5 ( hindering phase ) experimentally in magnetic materials like permalloy with damping coefficient engineering . a recent study @xcite demonstrated that @xmath1 of permalloy can increase by four times through a dilute impurity doping of lanthanides ( sm , dy , and ho ) .",
    "in conclusion , notches can boost dw propagation when @xmath4 .",
    "the boost is facilitated by antivortex generation and motion , and boosting effect is optimal when two neighboring notches is separated by the distance that an antivortex travels in its lifetime . in the boosting phase",
    ", dw can propagate at velocity @xmath25 that corresponds to a complete conversion of itinerant electron spins into local magnetic moments .",
    "when @xmath2 , the notches always hinder dw propagation . according to thiele s theory , the generation of vortices increases dw velocity for @xmath38 and decreases dw velocity when @xmath2 .",
    "this explains the origin of boosting phase and hindering phase .",
    "furthermore , it is found that a vortex wall favored in a very wide wire tends to transform to a transverse wall under a current .",
    "this may explain experimental observation that the depinning current density is not sensitive to dw types .",
