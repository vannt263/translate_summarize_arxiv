    "transient x - ray sources have been extensively studied from the beginning of x - ray astronomy .",
    "most of them are binary systems with a black hole ( bh ) or a neutron star ( ns ) as the primary .",
    "these systems have been primarily discovered when they entered outbursts characterised by an episode of high accretion rates and abrupt increases of x - ray luminosity by several orders of magnitude . during an outburst",
    ", the source goes through different spectral states : _ low / hard state _ ( lhs ) and _ high / soft state _ ( hss ) are the two principal states of black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) . in the lhs , the spectrum is described by a hard power law with photon index in the range of 1.5 - 2.0 , and in the latter , thermal emission ( @xmath9 1 kev ) from an optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disc dominates .",
    "there is also a _ steep power law state _ ( spl ) , described by a disk blackbody component plus power law with photon index @xmath10 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for extensive reviews on spectral states ) .",
    "the outbursts typically last a few months with recurrence period of many years ( @xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ns x - ray binaries also have such outbursts with much shorter recurrence period ( @xmath12 d ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) compared to the bh systems .",
    "however , bh and ns systems both show many remarkable similarities in their spectral states @xcite .",
    "ngc 55 is a magellanic - type , sb(s)m galaxy and its x - ray properties has been well studied by two _ xmm - newton _ observations conducted in 2001 @xcite .",
    "they identified 137 x - ray sources in the field of view and classified 42 x - ray sources in the @xmath13 region of the galaxy as x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , supernova remnants , and very soft sources .",
    "moreover , this galaxy hosts a very bright bhxb candidate , which showed a marked upward drift , significant chaotic variability and pronounced dips in the _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "this particular source belongs to the ultraluminous x - ray source class with x - ray luminosity @xmath14 .    in this paper , we report the outbursts from a new x - ray transient in ngc 55 .",
    "the transient source was discovered serendipitously from the inspection of archival _ xmm - newton _ observations , which were primarily selected for studying the variability of super soft x - ray sources . while a more detailed report on the variability of super soft x - ray sources will be presented later , in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on this transient which exhibited recurrent outbursts in the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) observations . in the following ,",
    " 2 describes the observations and data reduction techniques used .",
    "we explain the analysis and results in  3 and discuss the results and possible nature of the transient in  4 .",
    "we used archival _ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc 55 performed in 2001 november and 2010 may .",
    "the data from the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) pn detector were reduced and analysed using standard tools of the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis software ( sas ) version 13.5.0 .",
    "the full - field background light curve was extracted from the pn camera to remove the particle flaring background and create the good time intervals file .",
    "a count rate of @xmath15 in the 1012 kev light curve was used for the rejection .",
    "we used the pn events with the best quality data ( flag = 0 ) and pattern @xmath16 , and removed the hot pixels in the data by using the flag expression @xmath17 .",
    "the source detection routine ( edetect_chain ) was carried out using the standard parameters for epic - pn data over the entire energy bands and obtaining the final source list from 2001 and 2010 observations .",
    "we corrected the x - ray source positions by correlating the final source list with the usno a2.0 optical catalogue @xcite , using the sas task eposcorr .",
    "we also analysed two archival _ chandra _ observations conducted in 2001 and 2004 .",
    "chandra _ data were reduced and reprocessed using the science threads of _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) version 4.6 and heasoft version 6.15.1 .",
    "in addition , we used _ swift _",
    "xrt observations of the region carried out during 2013 april to 2014 october .",
    "we selected the observations with an exposure time of @xmath18 from the _ swift _ program , which resulted 24 observations ( see table [ log ] ) .",
    "we reduced the _ swift _ data using heasoft and the calibration database ( caldb ) files as of 2014 june 10 .",
    "we processed the photon counting mode of _ swift _ observations using the _ swift _ specific ftool xrtpipeline , by following the standard procedures .",
    ".observation log [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ fit ]",
    "we serendipitously discovered a new transient source in ngc 55 using the archival _ xmm - newton _ data obtained in 2010 .",
    "the source was undetected in the _ xmm - newton _ 2001 observation , and 2001 and 2004 _ chandra _ observations , whose deep sensitivities indicate a flux change of at least two orders of magnitude from @xmath19 to @xmath3ergs@xmath4 .",
    "thus , these observations establish that xmmu j001446.81 - 391123.48 is a new x - ray transient source in ngc 55 .    in considering the nature of xmmu j001446.81 - 391123.48",
    ", the x - ray colour classification scheme of @xcite identifies this source as an x - ray binary system .",
    "the high luminosities ( @xmath20 ) during the outbursts are consistent with the luminosity range of bright x - ray binaries , and also help to rule out the low - luminosity source classes , such as magnetic and non - magnetic cataclysmic variables @xcite and magnetars @xcite , as a possible candidate for this transient . apart from the high luminosity , the source displayed a strong short - term x - ray variability in the 2010 observation , further supporting the x - ray binary nature .",
    "there is no statistically significant difference between the power law and disk blackbody fits for the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum .",
    "the best fit photon index ( @xmath21 3.2 ) is too high for the hard state @xcite ; furthermore , the photon index is likely too high for the steep power law state also since the disk blackbody contribution makes the spl appear hard in the observed energy range @xcite . however , the best fit disk blackbody model is consistent with the thermally dominated spectrum @xcite , and we find this to be the most likely spectral state for the transient .",
    "moreover , such a thermally dominated spectrum for an x - ray transient has never been seen in ns x - ray binaries , suggesting that the accretor in the transient is a black hole @xcite .",
    "the follow - up studies with _ swift _ xrt revealed the source s outburst activity and it is possibly a fred phenomenon . during the 2013 may _ swift _ observations , the source had an outburst and reached the peak intensity , by having a factor @xmath22 flux increase , within @xmath23d .",
    "after the outburst , the flux decayed exponentially with an e - folding time of @xmath24d .",
    "this time scale is consistent with the e - folding time of black hole candidates in outburst @xcite .",
    "there are secondary peaks occurred prior ( 2013 april observations ) and after the outburst ( 2013 august observations ) , but the peaks only reached a level of @xmath25 of the main outburst peak .",
    "in addition , the peak prior to the outburst decayed very rapidly compared to the main outburst decay .",
    "thus , the source possibly showed a repeated outburst . the outburst recurrence period would be about a month , which is much smaller than the reported recurrence periods for the ns and bh systems @xcite .",
    "our co - added _ swift _ spectra only provide approximate spectral properties for the source . in the fainter state ( _ swift1 _ ) ,",
    "the spectrum is described by power law with index @xmath26 or disk blackbody with @xmath27kev .",
    "the source changed its luminosity by an order of magnitude and reached @xmath28 in the _ swift5 _ compared to _",
    "swift1 _ , but not much change in the power law index or disk blackbody temperature .",
    "although the large uncertainties on the parameters do not allow us to draw a clear conclusion , the results suggest that the source changed its luminosity by an order of magnitude without change in its state . in the observations ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity of xmmu j001446.81 - 391123.48 is @xmath29 of the eddington limit for a canonical @xmath30 ns , again suggesting that the primary is more likely a bh .",
    "finally , the transient source is located in the bar region which is displaced @xmath21 3 arcmin from the geometrical centre of ngc 55 @xcite .",
    "the very large array observations at 6 cm and 21 cm revealed that the radio continuum emission is concentrated on the bar region @xcite .",
    "moreover , the 6 cm radio emission is dominated by a triple source and this triple coincides with discrete @xmath31 and @xmath32 emission .",
    "also , the on - going star formation rate ( sfr ) in the bar region is consistent with the global sfr of ngc 55 ( @xmath33 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and suggests that the bar region is a young star formation complex with an age of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the transient source could be a young stellar system in the bar region of ngc 55 .    in summary , xmmu j001446.81 - 391123.48 is a new x - ray transient in the young stellar region of ngc 55 , possibly being a black hole x - ray binary .",
    "the repeated outbursts and prominent radio emission from the young stellar region made this source as a good candidate for the further follow - up studies at x - ray and radio wavelengths .",
    "such multi - wavelength studies can shed further light on the nature of xmmu j001446.81 - 391123.48 .",
    "we thank referee for constructive suggestions , and thank ranjeev misra and fuguo xie for useful comments on the manuscript . this work has made use of data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center .",
