    "our understanding of knots and links in topological field theory began with the work of polyakov @xcite who showed that the expectation value of a wilson line in the chern - simons theory gives the gaussian linking of the components of a link .",
    "this work was soon followed by witten s @xcite extensive exploration of expectation values of wilson lines in the non - abelian chern - simons theory which he showed is a natural framework for understanding jones polynomials from the knot theory .",
    "perturbative expansion of the expectation values leads to the third order linking and the corresponding link polynomials  @xcite .",
    "our approach is somewhat different .",
    "wilson loops in the abelian chern - simons theory also implicitly contains the requisite apparatus for the study of higher order linking , and we show here that this can be facilitated by a set of gauges @xcite tailored to the higher order linking problem .",
    "we begin with a discussion of intersection number and its relation to gaussian linking .",
    "next we review the minimal required background from poincar duality and the de rham theorem needed to carry out our calculations .",
    "we then introduce a special set of gauge potentials that allow us to arrive at our main result  higher order linking invariants at all orders .",
    "suppose @xmath0 and @xmath1 are disjoint oriented closed curves in @xmath2 , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are surfaces such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 . by smooth deformations of @xmath0 which leave it in @xmath7 ,",
    "we can change the number of points of intersection of @xmath0 and @xmath4 . to find a quantity which is invariant under such deformations , we note that additional points come in pairs , and intersections of @xmath0 and @xmath4 have opposite orientations for points in each pair . if @xmath0 and @xmath4 intersect transversely at a point @xmath8 , we define the intersection index @xmath9 to be equal @xmath10 or @xmath11 depending on the relative orientation of @xmath0 and @xmath4 at @xmath8 .",
    "we also define the intersection number @xmath12 as the sum of the intersection indices over all points of the intersection , @xmath13 it is clear that @xmath12 is invariant under the above deformations as contributions due to additional pairs of points cancel .",
    "one can also deform @xmath4 into @xmath14 and notice that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "this means that the intersection number depends only on @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; for this reason we call it the linking number , @xmath17 .",
    "examination of relevant orientations gives @xmath18 .",
    "the method of green functions leads to an explicit expression for the linking number of the curves in terms of their parametrizations , @xmath19",
    "from the poincar duality and de rham theorem  @xcite , for a closed curve @xmath0 in three dimensions , there exists a closed @xmath20-form @xmath21 such that for any @xmath10-form @xmath22 we have @xmath23 we call @xmath24 a dual set .",

    "the stokes theorem then gives  @xcite @xmath28 this means that there is a particular solution @xmath26 such that @xmath29 , @xmath30 we can similarly introduce a dual set @xmath31 such that @xmath32 and for any @xmath10-form @xmath33 we have @xmath34 taking @xmath35 , @xmath36 and using the stokes theorem again , we find @xmath37 since @xmath38 is a topological invariant , smooth deformations of @xmath0 which leave it in @xmath7 should not change its value .",
    "this is possible if and only if @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath40 is exact , then @xmath41 , and so a nontrivial case is when @xmath40 is a closed @xmath10-form which is not exact .",
    "suppose @xmath42 are disjoint closed curves in @xmath2 and let @xmath43 be dual to @xmath44 .",
    "we now construct a dual set @xmath45 of the second order which satisfies @xmath46 for any @xmath10-form @xmath22 and @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath22 is arbitrary , it follows that @xmath48 .",
    "the most general @xmath20-form which can be expressed in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath50 is @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are arbitrary functions . in order for @xmath55 to be closed , the functions have to satisfy certain conditions .",
    "a requirement @xmath56 gives @xmath57 and without loss of generality we set @xmath58 .",
    "requirements @xmath59 and @xmath60 then give @xmath61 integrating these conditions , we find a constraint @xmath62 .",
    "this means that the second order field associated with a pair of closed curves can be defined only if the curves are unlinked .    since @xmath63",
    ", there exists a @xmath10-form @xmath64 such that @xmath65 .",
    "we seek a solution in the form @xmath66 from a requirement @xmath65 , the unknown functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 are found to satisfy @xmath69 and the same expressions with @xmath70 and @xmath71 interchanged .",
    "this implies @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a curve in @xmath74 ; this means @xmath67 is a nonlocal quantity . if @xmath75 , then @xmath76 , and so @xmath77 is a constant . if @xmath78 , then @xmath79 , where @xmath80 labels disjoint segments of the intersection ; for an example , see fig .",

    "we define @xmath88 and its complement in @xmath85 is @xmath89 .",
    "it follows from the above relations that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are constants such that @xmath92 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we set @xmath93 and @xmath94 . using the definition of @xmath55 ,",

    "the above construction requires @xmath62 .",
    "since the curves @xmath44 and @xmath85 are unlinked , the surfaces @xmath82 and @xmath101 can be chosen to be disjoint , in which case @xmath102 .",

    "the quantities @xmath111 are related to what is known in algebraic topology as the massey products of cohomology groups  @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "we want to construct a field theory for which expectation values of observables are topological invariants of various orders . for this",
    "we need to specify the action and the observables .",
    "we choose the chern - simons action , @xmath112 since it has all the necessary topological properties @xcite .",
    "first , it does not depend on the choice of metric .",
    "second , it can be related to linking numbers in the following way .",
    "suppose @xmath113 is a closed curve on which @xmath114 takes a constant value @xmath115 .",
    "( in order for @xmath113 to be closed , we may need to identify points at infinity by considering @xmath116 instead of @xmath2 .",
    "we also avoid field configurations with sources , like in monopoles . ) since a union of curves @xmath117 densely fills @xmath2 , an arbitrary @xmath10-form @xmath22 can be written as @xmath118 .",
    "the action becomes @xmath119 and so ( apart from the choice of measure for @xmath120 ) we interpret it as the self - linking @xmath121 of the set of closed field lines of @xmath114 .    if @xmath122 is a union of disjoint closed curves , then an integral @xmath123 is invariant with respect to deformations of @xmath0 if and only if @xmath124 .",
    "since @xmath124 is the classical equation of motion for @xmath125 , the integral is a topological observable ( at least in the semiclassical limit ) .",
    "proceeding as above , we find @xmath126 which we interpret as the linking @xmath127 of the sets of closed field lines of @xmath114 with @xmath0 . since the measure in the path integral is @xmath128 , it is convenient to consider as an observable a wilson loop operator @xmath129 .",
    "we thus need to compute the expectation value @xmath130 using duality , this becomes @xmath131 where @xmath132 is dual to @xmath0 .",
    "changing the variable @xmath133 gives four terms in the exponent .",
    "one corresponds to the path integral of the measure without a wilson loop , @xmath134 , the two mixed terms combine into a boundary term , and the forth is the linking invariant . ignoring the boundary term , we find @xmath135    if we take @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a curve @xmath138 repeated @xmath139 times , then we find @xmath140 here @xmath141 is the first order linking of curves @xmath138 and @xmath142 ; it can also be interpreted as a linking of order @xmath143 of the curves @xmath42 . in general",
    ", @xmath144 is a sum of all linkings of orders @xmath145 .",
    "we now look at two simple examples .",
    "the simplest example is when only the second order linkings appear .",

    "the second order linking vanishes and the third order linking is given by @xmath149 .",
    "comparison of figs .",
    "[ figure - second - order - curve ] and [ figure - borromean - rings ] shows that @xmath150 .",
    "this can also be seen from @xmath151 since in the special gauge the first term equals @xmath10 , two contributions to the second term cancel , and the third term vanishes .",
    "the symmetry then leads to @xmath152 .",
    "in the chern - simons theory , the first order ( gaussian ) linking of two curves @xmath153 and @xmath154 associated with the 1-forms @xmath155 and @xmath156 can be ascribed to the topological properties of the expectation value that the associated wilson lines are found to obey .",
    "here we have generalized the idea to the case of higher order linking .",
    "first , if @xmath153 and @xmath154 are unlinked , then we are free to define a new second order 1-form @xmath157 via eq . ( 11 ) . the associated curve @xmath158 , unlike @xmath153 and @xmath154 , is not fixed in space , but is however sufficient for our topological needs , which are to investigate its linking with other curves . if for instance we have a third curve @xmath159 unlinked with both @xmath153 and @xmath154 , but linked with @xmath158 , then we find nonzero second order linking , i.e. , a nonvanishing second order topological invariant , and a detailed treatment of the borromean rings we given as an example of our method .",
    "the argument generalizes to higher orders . for curves",
    "@xmath42 , with no pairwise linking , no tertiary linking , etc .",
    ", only @xmath160th order linking , the general results are obtained from the path integral of the expectation value of @xmath161 wilson lines in the chern - simons gauge theory .",
