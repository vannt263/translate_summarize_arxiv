    "metamaterials ( mms ) are artificial media that exhibit fascinating electromagnetic properties not present in nature @xcite .",
    "they are usually manufactured from arrays of sub - wavelength resonators .",
    "therefore , effective media theory is used to study their behavior @xcite . by analogy with natural materials ,",
    "the sub - wavelength resonators form the basic unit cells ( atoms ) of the mm .",
    "each unit cell has electric and magnetic multipoles .",
    "if the cells inter - spacing is small , they can strongly interact and hence substantially change the media properties @xcite . inspired by stereochemistry , the interaction can be controlled by changing the spatial arrangement of the resonators .",
    "this concept , widely known as _ stereometamaterials _ , was applied to different mm configurations @xcite .",
    "similarly , the media properties can change by tuning the unit cell s resonant frequency .",
    "this can be done for example , by incorporating a photo - conductive semiconductor @xcite .",
    "the analogy between the mm unit cells and atoms is utilized to visualize the interaction between mm unit cells as the _ hybridization _ of unit cells modes .",
    "this concept was first applied to the study of nano - shells and nano - spheres @xcite .",
    "later , it was adopted to qualitatively and experimentally analyze the interaction between either split ring resonators ( srrs ) , which are the building blocks of mm @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the dipole moments determines the nature and strength of coupling . due to the bi(iso / aniso)tropic property of split rings ,",
    "both electric and magnetic dipoles play roles in the process of coupling @xcite .",
    "because of the sub - wavelength nature of mm unit cells , the coupling between them was studied based on quasi - static approaches . for example , the current and charge densities are used to determine the lagrangian ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the lagrangian equation of motion yields a system of coupled differential equations which determines the interaction terms @xcite . because of their importance",
    ", the analysis is usually carried out for meta - dimers .",
    "it is shown that the net effect of both the in - plane electrical and the out - of - plane magnetic dipoles determines the interaction strength @xcite .",
    "circuit models are also developed to model and to quantify split rings and their coupling @xcite .",
    "coupled mode theory ( cmt ) proves to be a very successful tool when applied to weakly coupled systems @xcite .",
    "it was used in mm @xcite , microwave filters @xcite , wireless power transfer @xcite and magnetic resonance @xcite . unlike finite element",
    ", finite difference and method of moments , cmt reduces the computational domain to the number of modes .",
    "other than reducing the computational complexity , cmt provides an intuitive picture of how a complex system behaves in terms of the interaction of its relatively simpler subsystems .",
    "this makes cmt a very useful and powerful tool for studying mm .    with the aim of qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing the hybridization of coupled systems including mms , an _ `` ab - initio '' _ coupled mode formalism is developed in the current article .",
    "a similar analysis was developed to study an electron paramagnetic probe consisting of a dielectric resonator and a cavity .",
    "however , it was limited to the studied case and bounded to te modes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown that a coupled mode formalism is still capable of describing the system behavior even though the coupling coefficient can be substantially large ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "besides the ability to calculate the eigen - frequencies , field dependent parameters such as the quality factor and resonator efficiency were accurately determined @xcite .",
    "the current article provides a systematic derivation of the general coupled mode equation in the form of an eigenvalue problem .",
    "once solved , the eigenvalues determine the resonant frequencies ( eigen - frequencies ) , while the eigenvectors are used to find the fields .",
    "the eigenvalue equation is proven to obey the energy conservation principle and hence is named energy coupled mode theory ( ecmt ) .",
    "it reduces to well known formulae when applied to special cases , such as the hybridization of meta - dimers @xcite .",
    "moreover , ecmt provides a complimentary approach to the dipoles coupling widely used in examining the interaction of srrs .",
    "it also gives a numerical procedure for calculating frequencies and fields .",
    "two double srrs ( dsrrs ) configurations are numerically studied .",
    "the results are explained by assessing the effect of system parameters on the coupling coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is partitioned as follows : section ii presents the theoretical background with emphasis on field expansions and notations used .",
    "section iii is devoted to the theoretical derivation .",
    "section iv presents the results and discusses the hybridization of split - ring resonators .",
    "finally , the conclusion follows in section v.",
    "the fields of a system of coupled resonators are expanded in terms of the fields of the uncoupled subsystems , which are regarded as a basis set and they are not necessarily orthogonal . in general this",
    "set is infinite . for practical purposes",
    ", it can be truncated to a finite one of a suitable size @xmath3 .",
    "therefore    @xmath4    and @xmath5    here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the expansion coefficients of the electric and magnetic components respectively .",
    "the @xmath3 modes can be equal to or greater than the number of resonators .",
    "so a valid coupled mode can be the linear combination of the first mode of resonator one and the first mode of resonator two , or it can be the first mode of resonator one , the second mode of resonator one and the first mode of resonator two , etc .",
    "this procedure is very helpful , for instance , if the frequencies of two modes of one resonator are very close ( or degenerate ) , so they both couple with a third nearby mode of a different resonator . expansions ( [ efieldexp ] ) and ( [ hfieldexp ] ) are equivalent to the linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) in molecular orbital theory @xcite .    at the conductors surfaces , the surface current density @xmath8 is equal to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the unit normal .",
    "therefore , the current density @xmath11 is expanded in terms of the uncoupled fields as @xmath12    each @xmath13 uncoupled mode satisfies the sinusoidal time - varying maxwell s equations @xcite , therefore the curl of the fields can be written as :    @xmath14    @xmath15    here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the angular frequency ( @xmath18 ) , permeability , permittivity and current density of the @xmath13 uncoupled resonator respectively . in general ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 change with position @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , for the coupled system @xmath22    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath11 are the corresponding symbols for the coupled system .    in the current article",
    ", the dirac bra - ket notation is used to represent the inner product .",
    "for example , the inner product of two vector fields@xmath25 and @xmath26 is denoted by @xmath27 and by definition it is equal to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total volume .",
    "in this subsection , the resonance condition of the coupled system is derived in terms of the uncoupled parameters . for practical resonators ,",
    "the losses are small and ignored . later on after determining the fields , the losses can be obtained @xcite .",
    "therefore , the time - averaged poynting vector @xmath30 and @xmath31 are imaginary and the complex power equation is written as @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the time - average stored magnetic and electrical energy @xmath35 @xmath36 respectively . at resonance",
    "@xmath37 the power equation ( [ poynting ] ) is simplified to be @xmath38    by using expansions ( [ efieldexp ] ) , ( [ hfieldexp ] ) , ( [ jexpand ] ) and taking the complex conjugate , ( [ poysimp ] ) is written as    @xmath39    here @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the integral factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 in ( [ matresonance ] ) can be expressed in terms of the stored energy quantities by expanding @xmath44 , using the identity    @xmath45    and integrating over the total volume @xmath29 @xmath46    relation ( [ useful ] ) can be re - written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 . because @xmath50 and @xmath51 depend on the uncoupled parameters , they are called the uncoupled magnetic and electric energy respectively .",
    "the full matrix expression of ( [ useful2 ] ) is @xmath52 where @xmath53    equations ( [ useful2 ] ) and ( [ usefulmat ] ) relate the complex conjugate of the reactive power components @xmath54 and @xmath55 to the bulk stored energy components @xmath50 and @xmath51 .      to find the eigenvalue equation ,",
    "the total fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 are projected on the @xmath13 field components . projecting the total magnetic field @xmath57 onto the @xmath13 electric field component , @xmath58 one can write @xmath59    expanding @xmath56 and @xmath57 in terms of the fields @xmath58 and @xmath60 of the uncoupled systems , using ( [ efieldexp ] ) and ( [ hfieldexp ] ) , and integrating over the whole volume ,    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the @xmath63 coupled electrical energy .    equation ( [ firstcoupled ] ) relates the @xmath64 and @xmath65 coefficients to one another .",
    "one needs to find another relation between the two coefficients and substitute @xmath65 in term of @xmath64 to obtain the eigenvalue equation .",
    "this can be achieved by projecting the total electric field @xmath56 onto the @xmath13 magnetic field component , @xmath60 and noting that the electric field is either zero at infinity for open structures or it is normal to the bounding surface if the system is enclosed in a shield or a cavity , @xmath66 .",
    "thus one can arrive at , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the @xmath63 coupled magnetic energy .",
    "the two relations ( [ firstcoupled ] ) and ( [ secondcoupled ] ) can be written in matrix form as @xmath69 @xmath70    these two equations represent the projection of the coupled total fields onto the uncoupled ones . from here , the eigenvalue equation can be derived by noting that from ( [ secondmatrix ] ) @xmath71 substituting ( [ secmatrix2 ] ) back in ( [ firstmatrix ] ) one arrives at , @xmath72    equation ( [ eigen1 ] ) is the required eigenvalue equation , where the eigenvalues are the square of the angular frequency and the eigenvectors are the coefficients of the fields given by ( [ efieldexp ] ) .",
    "it represents a _ numerical recipe _ which mixes the _ ingredients _ ( uncoupled modes ) in specific _ quantities _ ( determined by the strength of overlap between the fields ) to obtain the coupled frequencies and fields .",
    "it is interesting to verify that , at resonance , the eigenvalue problem ( [ eigen1 ] ) satisfies the energy conservation principle given by ( [ resonance ] ) or ( [ matresonance ] ) .",
    "this is done by expanding the energy expressions ( [ wm ] ) and ( [ we ] ) in @xmath56 and @xmath57 according to ( [ efieldexp ] ) and ( [ hfieldexp ] ) . after some algebraic manipulation one can find that , @xmath73    using ( [ secmatrix2 ] ) @xmath74 the eigenvalue problem ( [ eigen1])can be rewritten as @xmath75    therefore , @xmath76    relation ( [ energyproof ] ) is identical to the resonance condition in ( [ resonance ] ) .",
    "this verifies that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors found using ( [ eigen1 ] ) guarantee that the system obeys the law of conservation of energy .      in this subsection",
    ", the eigenvalue problem ( [ eigen1 ] ) is solved to find the modes of a dsrr based on the hybridization of the two rings fundamental modes .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the analysis is applicable to a broad class of interacting resonators such as loop - gap resonators @xcite , degenerate meta - dimers @xcite , asymmetric meta - dimers @xcite and dsrrs .",
    "because the rings are thin , all the permittivity functions @xmath77 can be approximated by @xmath78 .",
    "thus , @xmath79 and ( [ eigen1 ] ) reduces to @xmath80    if the integrations volume is large and contains the near fields , then @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , the coupling is weak such that @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalue problem ( [ eigendsrr ] ) is simplified to @xmath83    furthermore , the operator @xmath84 and @xmath85 can be symmetrized by setting the complex amplitudes of the eigen - fields @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) to be real ( imaginary ) .",
    "using ( [ useful ] ) , ( [ simp1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath90    solving ( [ dsrr_simp ] ) , the coupled frequencies are found to be    @xmath91    and @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the angular frequencies of the symmetric ( bonding ) and anti - symmetric ( anti - bonding ) modes respectively .",
    "the _ strength _ of coupling can be quantified by defining the coupling coefficient @xmath2 as    @xmath95    due to the interaction ( off - diagonal terms ) between the uncoupled modes , the coupled frequencies @xmath93 and @xmath94 are different from @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the interaction is due to the @xmath98 term .",
    "this power interaction can be also explained in terms of the electric and magnetic field overlaps as given by ( [ useful ] ) and ( [ simp1 ] ) . an important special case is when @xmath99 .",
    "this , for example , represents the meta - dimer studied in @xcite using magnetic and electric dipole interactions . for meta - dimers , ( [ simp1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath100    eq .",
    "( [ degen ] ) says that @xmath2 can be regarded as the difference between a magnetic ( @xmath101 ) and an electric ( @xmath102 ) components .",
    "this result was previously derived using the lagrangian equation of motion @xcite and the perturbation method @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with lumped circuit models , where coupling is modelled by a mutual inductance @xmath103 and a mutual capacitance @xmath104 @xcite . when @xmath105 , the modes decouple",
    "this reinforces the findings of @xcite that there is no avoided crossing whenever @xmath105 as was before attributed to the higher order electric multipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "the decoupling of modes even though @xmath101 and @xmath102 are not negligibly small may seem counter intuitive . visualizing",
    "the coupling as a hybridization of two atomic structures at which the electric - electric dipole and the magnetic - magnetic dipole interactions counteract , alleviate the confusion .",
    "the eigenvalue problem ( [ dsrr_simp ] ) gives an alternative physical explanation by taking advantage of ( [ kappa ] ) .",
    "the condition @xmath105 is equivalent to @xmath106 or equivalently @xmath107 .",
    "this means that there is no interaction between the uncoupled modes , whenever the relative position and orientation of the meta - dimer atoms were meticulously tuned such that @xmath58 is orthogonal to @xmath108 . in another words",
    ", there is no energy transfer , or a pathway , between the two uncoupled modes and hence no split in frequency .    in the following ,",
    "two configurations , _ a _ and _ b _ , are treated separately .",
    "a _ consists of two coaxial circular srr which have resonant frequencies of 10.3 ghz and 15 ghz ( fig.[circhybrid ] ) .",
    "the net coupling strength ( reflected in the magnitude of the frequency split ) is calculated as a function of the angle @xmath109 between the two gaps .",

    "as a first step and due to the lack of analytical expressions , the fields and frequencies of the single uncoupled srrs are computed using hfss^^ eigenmode solver ( ansys corporation , pittsburgh , pa , usa ) .",
    "the fields are exported to a matlab^^ code where the matrices @xmath85 and @xmath84 are calculated and hence ( [ eigendsrr ] ) is solved to determine the coupled frequencies . finally , the frequency values are compared to the ones obtained by another hfss eigenmode simulation of the complete dsrr systems . for the hfss calculations ,",
    "the conductivity of the srr was assumed to be infinite .",
    "the solution domain was enclosed in an airbox which is 7 times larger than the srr width .",
    "the structure is considered to be embedded in open space .",

    "( [ freqcircdsrr ] ) shows the calculated frequency of configuration _ a _ using both ( [ eigendsrr ] ) and hfss eigenmode solver .",
    "it is clear from the figure that as the angle @xmath109 increases , the coupled frequencies deviate more from the uncoupled ones ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> there is recent interest in the inter / intra - element interactions of metamaterial unit cells . to calculate the effects of these interactions which can be substantial , an _ `` ab - initio '' _ general coupled mode equation , in the form of an eigenvalue problem , is derived . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the master equation gives the coupled frequencies and fields in terms of the uncoupled modes . by doing so , the problem size is limited to the number of modes rather than the , usually large , discretized spatial and temporal domains obtained by full - wave solvers . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the method can be considered as a _ numerical recipe _ which determines the behavior of a complex system once its simpler _ ingredients _ are known . </S>",
    "<S> besides quantitative analysis , the coupled mode equation proposes a pictorial view of the split rings hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> it can be regarded as the electromagnetic analog of molecular orbital theory . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the eigenvalue problem for different configurations gives valued information and insight about the coupling of metamaterials unit cells . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it is shown that the behavior of split rings as a function of the relative position and orientation can be systematically explained . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by singling out the effect of each relevant parameter such as the coupling coefficient and coupled induced frequency shift coefficients . </S>"
