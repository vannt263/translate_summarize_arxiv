    "<S> [ fig : contours](d ) shows the classical cyclotron frequency for the swm dispersion at @xmath61 , which vanishes at @xmath44 .    in the language of quantum mechanics , the @xmath62 energy spectrum consists of discrete landau levels ( lls ) @xmath63 . in the quasiclassical approximation </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath63 can be found from the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule . the @xmath64 cr harmonic corresponds to the transition over @xmath36 levels , @xmath65 , to the leading order in  @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of @xmath67 at @xmath46 corresponds to an accumulation of lls . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , @xmath68 does not approach zero , since the condition of the validity of the quasiclassical quantization , @xmath69 , holds only if @xmath6 is not too close to @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> lls always remain discrete , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : contours](d ) . as we will show later </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath70 is about 6  mev , i.e. , it is five times larger than the microwave frequency , @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> our classical approximation is justified in this case . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> , the quasi - classical approximation works the better , the smaller @xmath12 is . </S>",
    "<S> however , if microwave frequency is too small , the harmonic structure will be smeared by broadening of electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal frequency , used in the experiment , is thus determined by an appropriate compromise between these two competing conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the absorbed power is proportional to the real part of the conductivity , @xmath72 , and calculating the latter from the standard kinetic equation  @xcite in the simplest relaxation time approximation for the collision integral ( see supplementary information ) , we obtain @xmath73 where the @xmath74 integration is from @xmath75 to @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> both the cyclotron frequency , @xmath13 , and the cyclotron mass , @xmath77 , depend on @xmath6 and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the basic frequency @xmath78 , introduced earlier , is @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80 is the fourier harmonic of the electron velocity , corresponding to the term @xmath81 , determined from the solution of the unperturbed equation of motion , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ newton= ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , @xmath82 accounts for relaxation , and @xmath83 is the fermi function .    even without solving eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ newton= ] ) , it is easy to see that the triangular symmetry of @xmath5 in the @xmath8 plane fixes @xmath84 for @xmath85 , @xmath86 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : singlespkt](b ) , the resonances at @xmath85 are absent , which demonstrates that the triangular symmetry is not broken in graphite . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with recent reports for a bilayer graphene  @xcite , even though it is formally described by the same single - particle hamiltonian ( for a fixed @xmath74 )  @xcite . the same symmetry fixes @xmath87 to be real and @xmath88 for @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> , so the peaks at @xmath89 and @xmath90 are seen in the opposite circular polarizations of the microwave field . </S>",
    "<S> this helps us to understand the observed difference in the intensities of the @xmath89 and @xmath90 series . indeed , for @xmath34 , when the electron moves along the fermi surface , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : contours](b ) , in the overall counterclockwise direction , it should be more strongly coupled to the counterclockwise polarized radiation . as both circular </S>",
    "<S> polarizations are equally present in the incoming linearly polarized radiation , the spectrum is fairly symmetric with respect to @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> the present studies are restricted to bulk graphite , a system with fixed fermi level but in an apparent proximity to the lifshitz transition . </S>",
    "<S> an obvious experimental challenge would be to trace the cr response when changing the fermi level with respect to the separatrix energy , with an attempt to tune the proximity to lifshitz transition in graphitic structures . </S>",
    "<S> this can be in principle envisaged for electrostatically gated bilayer graphene  @xcite and/or for bulk graphite under hydrostatic pressure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , such experiments require no degradation of the quality of the sample , which likely excludes the experiments on , for example , chemically doped structures .    besides the large number of harmonics , typical of a classical motion near a saddle point , the proximity to the lifshitz transition also leads to some lowering of the cyclotron frequency . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the fundamental cyclotron frequency determined from the period in @xmath27 of the spectrum , @xmath92 , is slightly lower than its parabolic - band limit at @xmath61 , @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter value , however , relies on the specific values of the parameters of the swm model . </S>",
    "<S> more apparent effects are deduced from the analysis of the peak shapes ( which are determined by the integration over  @xmath74 ) .    as seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : singlespkt](c ) , each peak has an abrupt cut - off on the _ high - frequency _ side and a tail on the _ low - frequency _ side . </S>",
    "<S> this contradicts the first intuition , based on the well - known fact that the parabolic part of the bands becomes steeper as @xmath74 increases from the @xmath19  point towards the @xmath20  point . </S>",
    "<S> this pushes the lls upwards as @xmath74 increases and would result in a tail on the _ high - frequency _ side of each peak in the absorption spectrum @xmath94  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the bottom of the conduction band [ defined as @xmath95 and the saddle point @xmath96 shift upwards upon increasing @xmath74 , as @xmath97 , @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the fermi level approaches the saddle point as @xmath74 moves away from @xmath62 point and @xmath99 decreases simultaneously , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : contours](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a tail on the _ low - frequency _ side of the peaks . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the suppression of @xmath13 near the lifshitz transition is crucial to interpret the peak asymmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum derived from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ abs= ] ) is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theory ] , with @xmath47 and @xmath82 as the only adjustable parameters  the parameters of the swm model were fixed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the best agreement is obtained for @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath101 , the peaks have no asymmetry , since @xmath102 has a significant upturn on increasing  @xmath74 . when @xmath103 the fall - off of large-@xmath36 harmonics is noticeably slower than the experimental one . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the closer @xmath47 is to @xmath60 , the more harmonics are seen in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency @xmath104 agrees with the experimental value , @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath106 is also in good agreement with the one determined independently from the charge neutrality condition ( see supplementary information ) , @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> a constant value of @xmath108 was assumed for the curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theory](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , this does not describe well the amplitudes of peaks at @xmath109 : the theoretical peaks are narrower and thus more intense than the experimental ones . </S>",
    "<S> better agreement is obtained under assumption that @xmath110 ( see ref .   and supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the curve in fig .  [ fig : theory](b ) with @xmath111}\\:\\mbox{mev}$ ] corresponds to the zero - field relaxation rate @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted value of @xmath113 provides the zero - field dc conductivity @xmath114 ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is fully consistent with typical literature data  @xcite and implies a mean electron free path of 6  @xmath115 m , which is , notably , comparable or even longer than the corresponding values reported for strictly 2d graphene - based structures  @xcite .    to conclude , we have introduced cr experiments as a new tool to study lifshitz transitions . we have shown how the proximity to the lifshitz transition manifests itself in the cr spectrum of a model system , bulk graphite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we have observed a multi - mode response , where the basic cr mode is accompanied by many harmonics . using the standard swm model for the electronic band structure of graphite to analyze the data , we have determined the fermi energy and estimated the electronic broadening . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity between the band structure of graphite near the @xmath19  point and that of a bilayer graphene logically suggests to probe lifshitz transition in the latter system by cr methods , and to shed more light on the currently debated issue of spontaneous symmetry breaking in bilayer graphene  @xcite .    </S>",
