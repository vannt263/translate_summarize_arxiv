    "the hera accelerator at desy , germany , with collision energies of @xmath5 gev was the hitherto highest energy lepton - hadron collider .",
    "one of the great achievements of hera was the determination of the partonic structure of the proton @xcite .",
    "a lepton - hadron collision is mediated by a virtual photon , which interacts with a valence- or sea - quark within the hadron at a resolution @xmath6 . when probed at higher energies ,",
    "gluons fluctuating into gluon- or quark - pairs can be resolved at smaller time scales , such that more partons share the hadron s longitudinal momentum at higher energies . at small momentum fractions @xmath7 of",
    "the participating partons , measurements at hera showed that the content of the proton is dominated by gluons , and that the gluon number density at smaller @xmath8 seems to rise uncontrollably . when extrapolating current measurements to small @xmath8-values , the gluonic part of the cross - section becomes larger than the total proton cross - section .",
    "this violation of the unitarity bound can only be avoided by introducing saturation effects that tame the explosive growth of the gluon density .",
    "while many saturation models describing these non - linear effects were developed @xcite , there exists no _",
    "direct _ measurement that would allow to verify these models and ultimately prove the existence of gluon saturation .",
    "although more and more tantalizing hints of the onset of gluon saturation coming from proton - ion collisions at rhic have become available @xcite , alternative explanations can currently not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "the direct study of these non - linear saturation effects would require lepton - hadron collisions at energies far exceeding those at hera .",
    "electron - ion collisions offer an alternative way to study high gluon - density phenomena at an order of magnitude lower center - of - mass energies . at high enough energies the small @xmath8 gluons in the heavy ion have a wave length in the longitudinal direction that encompass the entire width of the nucleus",
    ". a probe will thus coherently interact with the bulk of low-@xmath8 gluons . for a heavy ion ,",
    "the thickness is approximately constant away from the edges and is proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is its atomic number .",
    "this approximate dependence is supported by detailed studies @xcite .",
    "therefore , probing a heavy ion with @xmath11 is similar to probing a proton at 6 times higher energy , making the nucleus an efficient amplifier of the physics of high gluon densities .",
    "there are two proposed future collider projects that aim to directly measure the saturated gluon regime for the first time : the large hadron - electron collider ( lhec ) at cern using the existing lhc machine @xcite and the electron - ion collider ( eic ) in the usa @xcite , using either the existing rhic accelerator complex at bnl ( erhic ) , or the existing electron beams at jlab ( meic ) .    at hera ,",
    "an unexpected discovery was that approximately 10% of the @xmath12 cross - section is from diffractive final states @xcite and that this fraction is fairly independent of @xmath13 and @xmath6 .",
    "what characterizes these events experimentally is the presence of a rapidity gap , a region in the angular coverage which exhibits _ no _ hadronic activity .",
    "diffractive interactions result when the electron probe in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) interacts with a color neutral vacuum excitation .",
    "this vacuum excitation , which in perturbative qcd may be visualized as a colorless combination of two or more gluons , is often called the pomeron .",
    "the hard diffractive cross - section is proportional to the gluon - density _ squared _ , making it the most sensitive probe of gluon density known .",
    "thus , diffraction and saturation are closely related phenomena .",
    "measurements of diffraction in an electron - ion collider also have substantial potential to shed light on other unanswered questions in heavy ion collision @xcite .",
    "measurements over the last decade in heavy ion collision experiments at rhic indicate the formation of a strongly coupled plasma of quarks and gluons ( sqgp ) .",
    "this sqgp appears to behave like a  near - perfect liquid \" with a ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density ( @xmath14 ) approaching @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "recent experiments at the lhc with substantially higher energies and thus a hotter and longer lived plasma phase confirm this picture @xcite . despite the significant insight that the sqgp is a",
    "strongly correlated nearly perfect liquid , little is understood about how the system is created .",
    "the largest uncertainty in our understanding of the evolution of a heavy - ion collision comes from our limited knowledge of the initial condition , i.e. momentum and spatial distributions of gluons in the nuclei . also of importance",
    "is how the spatial distribution fluctuates around its mean , since it affects the behavior of collective effects such as flow and their higher moments .",
    "for example , different assumptions about the nuclear initial distributions give differences up to factors of two for the obtained @xmath14 value @xcite .",
    "measurements of the initial gluon distribution with existing machines are only possible indirectly and with large uncertainties .",
    "the study of gluon distributions using diffractive events in electron - ion collisions would allow one to directly measure the initial condition of the colliding ions , providing both its momentum and spatial distributions as well as the underlying fluctuations ( `` lumpiness '' ) .",
    "in fact , exclusive diffractive @xmath16a events are the only way to study the initial spatial distributions and shed light on these fundamental questions .    in a diffractive @xmath16a event",
    ", the electron collides with the ion producing one or more extra particles but leaving the nucleus intact .",
    "the interaction with the nucleus is either elastic or inelastic , and in the latter case the nucleus subsequently radiates a photon or breaks up into color neutral fragments .",
    "when it stays intact , the event is called coherent and when it breaks , the event is called incoherent .",
    "the spectrum of the cross - section with respect to the hadronic momentum transfer @xmath17 is related to the transverse spatial distribution of the gluons in the ion through a fourier transform . also , according to the good - walker picture @xcite , the incoherent cross - section is a direct measure of the lumpiness of the gluons in the ion . in order to access @xmath17 in these events ,",
    "the complete final state has to be measured .",
    "this is experimentally only possible in events such as vector - meson production or deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) .    at present ,",
    "the most common approach to calculate diffractive cross - sections at small @xmath8 is in the dipole model , where the exchanged virtual photon splits up into a quark anti - quark pair , which forms a color dipole .",
    "the dipole subsequently interacts with the target in the target s rest frame .",
    "the dipole model became an important tool for dis when golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw ) @xcite observed that a simple ansatz for the dipole model integrated over the impact parameter was able to simultaneously describe the total inclusive and diffractive cross - sections .",
    "the gbw model also naturally contains saturation in the small @xmath8 regime .",
    "a shortcoming of the gbw model is that it can not describe the high @xmath6 scaling violation in the inclusive cross - sections measured at hera , something perfectly described by the collinear dglap formalism , which in turn can not describe the high fraction of diffractive events .",
    "this sparked bartels , golec - biernat and kowalski ( bgbk ) to include an explicit dglap gluon distribution into the dipole formalism @xcite , taken at a scale directly linked to the dipole size .",
    "the bgbk model replicates the gbw model where it is applicable and also manages do describe the @xmath6 dependence of the cross - sections .",
    "however , this approach still integrates out the impact parameter dependence of the interaction , without which the @xmath17-dependence of the cross - section is unknown .",
    "the impact parameter dependence was introduced in the dipole model by kowalski and teaney @xcite and then modified to also include exclusive processes by kowalski , teaney and motyka @xcite .",
    "this dipole model goes by the name bsat ( or sometimes ipsat ) , and is the main focus of this paper .",
    "the bsat model has been studied in detail in the case of electron proton collisions at hera .",
    "there are a few theoretical attempts to expand the bsat model to also describe exclusive @xmath16a collisions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . without exception",
    ", these models fail to describe the disappearance of the incoherent cross - section as @xmath18 . also , they turn out to be poorly suited for implementation in a monte carlo event generator .    in this paper",
    "we present the first calculations of not only the coherent but also the incoherent cross - sections in electron - ion collision without making approximations larger than those already inherently present in the bsat model , for all @xmath17 .",
    "we have implemented the calculation described in this paper in a monte carlo event generator ( sar_t_re ) .",
    "the paper is organized as followed : in section [ bsat ] we will show our derivation of the dipole model in @xmath16a , taking as a starting point the case of @xmath12 .",
    "in section [ results ] we will present the resulting cross - sections , both as comparisons with hera data and as predictions for eic and rhic .",
    "earlier studies of the dipole model showed that a wide variety of dis data can be described with only a few assumptions .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated that inclusive dis can be described together with inclusive charm production and exclusive diffractive vector meson photo- and electro - production .",
    "especially the bsat dipole model is very successful in describing the exclusive production of j/@xmath19 , @xmath3 , @xmath20 , and photon ( dvcs ) production at hera .",
    "here we only give a short overview of the bsat model in @xmath12 before we discuss its extension to @xmath16a collisions . for a detailed discussion on the bsat model see @xcite .      the amplitude for producing an exclusive vector meson or a real photon diffractively in dis",

    "it should be noted that bsat is a model of multiple two - gluon exchanges at leading log , but some nexto - to - leading order effects are taken into account by the running of the strong coupling .",
    "the total diffractive @xmath46 cross - section for this process is : @xmath47      the explicit impact parameter dependence of the bsat model makes it especially well suited for the description of processes in @xmath16a collisions .",
    "the @xmath48 dependence allows one to model the nucleus as a collection of nucleons according to a given nuclear transverse density distribution , e.g.  the woods - saxon function . to this end",
    "we make two observations .",
    "firstly , at small @xmath8 , the life - time of the dipole is so large that the dipole traverses the full longitudinal extent of the nucleus . as a consequence",
    "the nucleus can effectively be treated as a two - dimensional object in the transverse plane .",
    "also , when the gluon s momentum fraction of the hadron is small , its wavelength in the light - cone direction @xmath49 becomes so large , that it coherently probes the whole nucleus at @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mass of the nucleus and @xmath52 is the proton radius .",
    "consequently , the information about which nucleon the gluon belongs to is lost , and the exact position of each nucleon within the nucleus is not an observable . in order to calculate the cross - section correctly",
    "the average over all possible states of nucleon configurations has to be taken : @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes nucleon configurations .",
    "one defines two different kinds of diffractive events in @xmath16a : coherent and incoherent . in the good - walker picture",
    "@xcite the incoherent cross - section is proportional to the variance of the amplitude with respect to the initial nucleon configurations @xmath54 of the nucleus : @xmath55 where the first term on the r.h.s is the total diffractive cross - section and the second term is the coherent part of the cross - section .",
    "when extending the bsat model from @xmath12 to @xmath16a we will use the independent scattering approximation to construct the scattering amplitude for nuclei : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the position of each nucleon in the nucleus in the transverse plane .",

    "the second and first moments of the amplitude have to be calculated respectively .",

    ". will converge to the true average . for the total diffractive cross - section one",
    "gets : @xmath66 for large @xmath17 the variance is several orders of magnitude larger than the average .",
    "this means that the convergence of the sum in eq .   becomes extremely slow , as demonstrated in fig .",

    "not even 800 configurations are enough for convergence at @xmath67 .    the convergence of the second moment of the amplitude is shown in fig .  [ fig : convergence](b ) .",
    "we conclude that around 500 configurations are needed to obtain a good description of the cross - section for @xmath68 .",
    "saturation is introduced in the bsat model through the exponential term in the scattering amplitude ( eq .  ) . in order to study the effects of saturation on the production cross - section we construct a non - saturated version of the bsat model by linearizing the dipole cross - section .",
    "it should be noted that there is no taming of the rise of the cross - section for small @xmath69 or large dipole radii in this case , and studies are only valid where @xmath70 is large . for exclusive diffraction",
    "this is equivalent to keeping @xmath6 large .",
    "any other way to impose a limit on the rise of the cross - section , e.g.  through a cut - off , inevitably also imposes some form of saturation into the formalism .    in the proton case , the bnonsat dipole cross - section",

    "these corrections are important for describing hera data , where the models are valid the corrections are typically around 60% of the cross - section , out of which the skewedness correction amounts to around 45% .",

    "we have written a computer program to sample and average over nuclear configurations .",
    "this program is also the core of a novel event generator , sar_t_re , which is briefly described in appendix [ sartre ] .",

    "and , when integrated over the impact - parameter , yields unphysical results for large dipole radii : @xmath98 where @xmath99 . for large @xmath24 the @xmath100 contribution becomes dominant .",
    "however , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipolecrosssectiona ] , this growth has no effect on the actual production cross - sections ( eq .   and ) due to the implicit cut - off of the wave - overlap at already moderate radii .    to nevertheless protect against this unphysical behavior",

    "the cross - section is dominated by its incoherent part , which is thus essential for making realistic predictions for future @xmath16a experiments .",
    "high energy @xmath16a collisions are expected to be sensitive to non - linear saturation effects .",
    "we have therefore implemented our method in two dipole models : the bsat model and its linearization the bnonsat model .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : eic1 ] and [ fig : eic2 ] we show that in an @xmath16a collider , the two models are clearly distinguishable , which is not the case in previous @xmath12 experiments .",
    "we also show that @xmath3-meson production is considerably more sensitive to non - linear effects than @xmath2-meson production .",
    "this is due to the larger size of the wave - function overlap for the @xmath3-meson . in figs .",
    "[ fig : eic3 ] and [ fig : source ] , we show that one can probe the transverse spatial gluon distribution of a nucleus by performing a fourier transform of the measured coherent @xmath17-spectrum .",
    "this method is very robust with respect to statistical uncertainties and only requires a range of @xmath142 gev@xmath41 for gold .",
    "due to its smaller wave function , the @xmath2-meson is considerably more suitable for probing the spatial gluon distribution than the lighter @xmath3-meson . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eic3 ] we also show the incoherent @xmath17-spectrum , which is directly proportional to the lumpiness of the initial nucleus .",
    "our method can also be used to calculate upc events in present hadron - hadron colliders .",

    "we generate the nucleus according to the woods - saxon distribution , which is assumed to describe the number density of nucleons per volume element , i.e. : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the central density , @xmath103 is the radius of the nucleus and @xmath145 is the skin thickness which describes how fast the potential falls off close to the edge of the nucleus . the parameters @xmath144 , @xmath103 and @xmath145 have been measured for most nuclei in low - energy experiments @xcite .",
    "our method for generating a nucleus is as follows :    1 .   we first generate the radial distribution of all nucleons in a given nucleus specimen according to : @xmath146 and sort them in @xmath24 .",

    "if the newly generated nucleon position is within a core distance of @xmath148  fm from any other nucleon we regenerate @xmath3 and @xmath147 , keeping the original @xmath24 .",

    "sar_t_re is a novel monte carlo event generator , implementing the models described in this paper .",
    "it generates exclusive events in diffractive vector meson and dvcs production for @xmath12 and @xmath16a collisions .",
    "the master equation of sar_t_re is eq .  .",
    "in the event generator , this cross - section is simply used as a probability density function from which a phase - space point in @xmath6 , @xmath149 , and @xmath17 is drawn .",
    "given the beam energies and these three kinematic variables , the final state of the event is fully defined except for the azimuthal angle of the vector meson , which is uniformly distributed .    to determine the total cross - section in @xmath16a , the complex four - dimensional integral described in eq .",
    "has to be calculated for each phase - space point 1000 times , which is prohibitive for efficient event generation .",
    "therefore , we tabulate the first and second moments of the amplitudes , for both longitudinally and transversely polarized photons separately . the resulting look - up tables are three dimensional in @xmath6 , @xmath149 and @xmath17 .",
    "there is a set of four look - up tables ( @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) for each species of produced vector meson or dvcs , and for each species of nucleus .",
    "when an event has been generated it is decided probabilistically weather the event was coherent or incoherent by comparing the coherent cross - section in eq .   with the total one .",
    "in the incoherent case we let the nucleus break up by assuming that the diffractive mass @xmath154 is distributed according to : @xmath155 note that @xmath154 can not be uniquely determined from kinematics alone .",
    "the corresponding excitation energy of the nucleus is : @xmath156 we then use this excitation energy as input for @xcite , a statistical model code which describes the nuclear de - excitation , providing the break - up products from neutrons up to the heaviest fragments .",
