    "the discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider(lhc)@xcite@xcite is a major step towards understanding the electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) mechanism and marks a new era in particle physics .",
    "the precise measurement of the higgs boson and the top quark properties would provide the possibility of searching for the anomalous flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) yukawa interactions between them and either an up or charm quark(@xmath0 ) . according to the standard model(sm ) ,",
    "fcnc processes are forbidden at tree level and very much suppressed at higher orders due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani(gim ) mechanism@xcite .",
    "for instance , the @xmath6 branching ratio is of the order of @xmath7 or even below . in models beyond the sm(bsm ) , the gim suppression can be relaxed , yielding effective tqh couplings orders of magnitude much larger than those of the sm and therefore being detectable using current experimental data . observations of such anomalous top - higgs couplings would provide a clear signal of new physics .",
    "examples of such model extensions@xcite are , for instance , the minimal supersymmetric model(mssm ) with / without r - parity violating @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , the two higgs doublet model(2hdm ) @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , the warped extra dimensions model @xcite@xcite , the alternative left - right symmetric model(alrm)@xcite , the little higgs with t parity model(lht)@xcite , the quark singlet model(qs)@xcite@xcite@xcite , etc .",
    "considering the fcnc yukawa interactions in the effective field theory(eft ) framework , the sm lagrangian can be extended simply by allowing the following terms , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the real parameters and denote the flavor changing couplings of higgs to up - type quarks .",
    "now we have @xmath11 minus @xmath12 larger than @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in addition to the usual decay mode @xmath16 , the top quark can also decay into a charm or up quark associated with a higgs boson .",
    "similarly , the new tqh interactions can also affect the width of the higgs boson , through its additional decay into an off - shell top that subsequently leads to a single w , namely @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes off - shell top quark .",
    "therefore , the total decay width of the top quark(@xmath19 ) and higgs boson(@xmath20 ) are @xmath21 @xmath22 is the normal top decay width in the sm .",
    "its analytical formula up to next - to - leading order(nlo ) can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 partial decay width is given as@xcite @xmath24 \\sqrt{1-(\\tau_h-\\tau_{u(c)})^2}\\sqrt{1-(\\tau_h+\\tau_{u(c)})^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the normal two body higgs decay width in the sm .",
    "the other terms related to the higgs boson three - body decays are numerically estimated . the branching ratio for @xmath28",
    "is then given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the fermi constant . with parameters that would present in the following we get @xmath32 which is used in the extraction of the couplings in our analysis .",
    "since the analysis does not distinguish between the @xmath33 and @xmath34 final states which have similar acceptances , we use @xmath34 mode as reference throughout this work without other statement .",
    "the searches for the anomalous fcnc top - higgs coupling have been investigated at the lhc and the direct limits on the branching ratio are set from the collider experiments .",
    "the most stringent constraint through direct measurements was reported by the cms collaboration from a combination of the multilepton channel and the diphoton plus lepton channel@xcite .",
    "the results are corresponding to 19.5 @xmath3 data at the center - of - mass energy of 8 tev . the 95@xmath5 confidence level(c.l . )",
    "upper limit on @xmath35 has found to be @xmath36 for a higgs boson mass of 126 gev .",
    "similarly , the atlas collaboration has performed the search through @xmath37 decay followed by @xmath38 in a data set of proton - proton collisions , consisting of 4.7 @xmath3 at @xmath39 and 20.3 @xmath3 at @xmath40@xcite@xcite .",
    "an upper limit is set on the @xmath37 branching ratio of @xmath41 at the @xmath42 confidence level .",
    "except for the direct collider measurements , low energy measurements in flavor mixing processes can also be used to provide indirect constrains on the anomalous tqh vertex . at one - loop level , the @xmath43 mixing observable can receive sizeable contributions with such an unvanishing flavor violating tqh coupling@xcite .",
    "use data observed on @xmath43 mixing , the upper limit of @xmath44 can be obtained .",
    "studying the fcnc top - higgs interactions is therefore important from a theoretical perspective .",
    "many phenomenological studies are performed based on the experimental data , through a widely studied @xmath45 decays and a single top higgs associated production mode .",
    "for instance , ref.@xcite performed a study on the top - higgs couplings through several productions and found that the process @xmath46 can be extremely useful in providing strong bounds on the tqh couplings of the order of @xmath47 with 2@xmath48 sensitivities using the full data at @xmath49 lhc . and",
    "this sensitivities can be improved just a bit more to @xmath50 for the 14 tev lhc with 300 @xmath3 data .",
    "the similar study was performed in ref.@xcite through @xmath51 , giving the upper limits of @xmath52 and @xmath53 with an integrated luminosity of 3000 @xmath3 at 3@xmath48 sensitivity at the @xmath54 lhc .",
    "ref.@xcite quoted a 95@xmath5 c.l .",
    "limit from the @xmath55 final state .",
    "the sensitivities of @xmath56 were estimated with an integrated luminosity of 300(3000 ) @xmath3 at @xmath57 . and ref.@xcite estimated the sensitivity based on 100 @xmath3 of 13 tev data . there the branching ratio @xmath35 were obtained to be @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 from multilepton searches , vector boson plus higgs search and fully hadronic search respectively . more , ref.@xcite derived model - independent constraints on the tqh couplings that arise from the bounds on hadronic electric dipole moments .",
    "ref.@xcite studied the nlo qcd effects in the anomalous @xmath37 decay .",
    "the nlo qcd effects of top higgs associated production with fcnc couplings were considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "many other related studies include , for example , ref.@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , etc , and references there in .    in our present paper , we perform an updated study on the anomalous fcnc yukawa interactions between the top quark , the higgs boson , and either an up or charm quark(@xmath61 , q = u , c ) at the large hadron electron collider(lhec ) .",
    "a former study was performed in ref.@xcite . there",
    "we briefly reviewed the search of this anomalous couplings at the lhec at a very basic level .",
    "a comparison between the different charge current(cc ) and neutral current(nc ) production channels were provided .",
    "there comes the conclusion that the cc induced @xmath1 production with @xmath62 , @xmath2 pair and @xmath63 decays are the favored candidate channels .",
    "@xmath38 channel was chosen because of its demonstrated high importance for inclusive higgs boson studies , with a rather clean signature at the normal lhc . however , for a higgs bosson mass around 125 gev , @xmath1 production with @xmath38 decay at the lhec , suffers from its small branching ratio(0.23@xmath5 ) , thus is not the most favored one . for @xmath64 channel , since the @xmath65 event reconstruction is challenge , thus making this decay channel less favored . in this paper",
    "we choose the @xmath66 mode which is more interesting than the other channels .",
    "in addition , the impact of light , charm jet mis - identification rates and b - tagging efficiencies on the discovery potential are quantified in our following discussions .",
    "discovery potential for the 50 tev high proton energy beam is also considered .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : section 2 is arranged to present the analysis and numerical results in detail .",
    "there comes the subsections include signal and background analysis , simulation and the lhec discovery potential .",
    "typically , we perform our analysis in a cut - based method and a multivariate analysis(mva ) based method .",
    "a comparison on their impact on the fcnc coupling discovery potential is performed .",
    "the expected limits are then obtained based on a event number counting method .",
    "finally we summarize our conclusion in the last section .",
    "the considered signal productions with top - higgs fcnc couplings can be written as @xmath67 where q = u , c .",
    "the feynman diagram is plotted in fig.[fig1_sig_feynman ] for the partonic process @xmath68 .",
    "this production belongs to the charge current production@xcite at the lhec .",
    "as can be seen , the studied topology of our signal gives rise to the @xmath69 signature characterized by three(or more than three ) jets and a missing transverse momentum(@xmath70 ) from the undetected neutrino .",
    "two of the jets should be tagged as b - jets .",
    "the combination of the two b - jets should appear as a narrow resonance centered around the sm higgs boson mass .",

    "another source of reducible background is single top production . as can be seen ,",
    "the signal process studied in our paper is essentially single top production at the @xmath79 collider , followed by a particular decay chain .",

    "secondly , we require the selected events must contain at least three jets",
    ". the distribution of the number of jets(@xmath106 ) is shown in the left panel of fig.[njetnbjet ] for 7(50 ) tev .",
    "all distributions for the signal and different backgrounds are unit normalized and plotted separately .",
    "the red area relates to the signal while the colour lines correspond to the backgrounds .",
    "we see the events that contain three jets account for around 50@xmath5 to the total , for both the signal and the backgrounds .",
    "more than 60@xmath5 events are kept when we include events with more than three jets .",
    "thirdly , we require that there must be at least two jets are tagged to be b - jets . the distribution of the number of the tagged b - jets(@xmath107 )",
    "is shown in the right panel of fig[njetnbjet ] .",
    "notice the b - tagging is performed at a @xmath110 efficiency working point .",
    "the mis - tagging rate for the low flavor jets are all taken into accounts .",
    "the normalized distribution does not distinguish with each other very much between 7 and 50 tev .",
    "it is clear that the selection of at least two b - jets could reduce all the backgrounds , especially multi - jet qcd backgrounds(purple dash - dotted line and black dotted line ) and bakt(blue dashed line ) backgrounds efficiently . by imposing cut2 , the most critical selection ,",
    "all the backgrounds are reduced obviously .",
    "more details can be seen in the third column in table.[sbaftercuts_7tev ] and table.[sbaftercuts_50tev ] .",
    "a @xmath111 cut is defined to be `` cut3 '' .",
    "this cut can again result in strong reduction in the nc @xmath112 background .",
    "but it is not quite efficient to the other productions , and has little impact on the signal as well . after imposing these three cuts",
    ", we see the bakej background drops from 50.5(244.6 ) pb to 0.89(7.39 ) fb for 7(50 ) tev , and leads to the largest reject efficiency .",

    "the bakh and bakz backgrounds are not very far from each other , about 10(40 ) fb after the three selections .",
    "they are rejected with a efficiency of around 85@xmath5 .",
    "the bakt background drops from 1.5(14 ) pb to 27.2(258.7 ) fb , with a reject efficiency of @xmath114 .",
    "finally , we can find that the signal events are selected with a selection efficiency of order @xmath115 for both 7 and 50 tev .",
    "details can be found in the first four columns .",
    "although the selections and rejections are quite efficient , the backgrounds are still much larger than the signal .",
    "our next step is to reconstruct the resonance in the selected events , typically , the reconstruction of the higgs boson and the top quark . as can be seen , the higgs boson can be easily reconstructed by considering the two tagged b - jets in the final state and summing over their 4-momentum . if more than two b - jets appear , we reconstruct the higgs by checking which two can reconstruct the mass closer to the input higgs mass .",
    "well , events with more than two b - jets rarely happen in our case , as can be seen in the distribution of @xmath107 in fig.[njetnbjet][right panel ] .",
    "the reconstructed higgs mass is presented in fig.[distributions - mhmtopy][first two panels ] , again , the signal is present in the red zone .",
    "we display different backgrounds separately and each of them is unit normalized .",
    "the bakej backgrounds are already quite small after cut3 , thus not shown in the figures here and following .",
    "we find that the reconstructed higgs mass for the signal is peaked strongly at @xmath116115 gev , however , 10 gev lower than the real input mass @xmath116125 gev .",
    "this is not strange .",
    "indeed , the peak is always shown up to the left side of the actual mass due to jet energy smearing .",
    "and the magnitude of shift depends on the jet - cone size which , in our case , is chosen to be 0.7 .",
    "a lower jet - cone size , for example , 0.5 , can lead to a little more `` left side '' shift of our reconstructed higgs mass .",
    "and there is no energy scale correction applied , thus the higgs mass is lower than 125 gev .",
    "this is also true for the top quark as well as the z(w ) boson mass reconstructions for the backgrounds .",

    "one anti - b quark is originated from the top quark while the other one is from the mis - tagging of the hadronic w decay .",

    "the signal significance is defined by @xmath122 we define the signal to background ratio by @xmath123 and their purity by @xmath124 here s and b relate to the numbers of the signal and background events respectively , under expected luminosity .",
    "these definitions are used in tables.[sbaftercuts_7tev ] and [ sbaftercuts_50tev ] .      here",
    "we first study the cut - based method . after applying the above pre - selections ( cut1 , cut2 and cut3 ) and adopting the resonant reconstructions ,",
    "the choice of further selections thus become straightforward .",
    "following information in fig.[distributions - mhmtopy ] , we require the invariant mass of the reconstructed top to be in the range @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "we define this cut to be `` cut4 '' .",
    "it reduces the bakz , bakh , bakej and bakvej backgrounds obviously , which do not contain a reconstructed top quark .",
    "the reject efficiencies are @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 for 7tev(50tev ) , respectively .",
    "notice unless mentioned otherwise , all the efficiencies are quoted with respect to the previous selection .",
    "for the signal and the bakt background which contain a reconstructed top quark , about half of the events pass the selection , lead to a @xmath130 and @xmath131 select(reject ) efficiency for them at 7 and 50 tev respectively . now",
    "the cross sections of the other backgrounds turn to the same order compare to the signal .",
    "the most largest background is the single top background which is 16.3(157.7 ) fb .",
    "more than 40 times larger than the signal . to reduce it",
    ", we require the events should not pass the selection if the b - j system belongs to [ 50gev , 90gev ] .",
    "this selection is defined to be `` cut5 '' . with this requirement ,",
    "the bakt background is reduced to 0.84(7.37 ) fb , same order of the signal now .",
    "we also impose `` cut6 '' : two b - jets invariant mass should out of the z boson mass window , which can reduce , for example , the bakz background .",
    "in addition , once a higgs boson has been identified , its mass is required to lie within a fixed window around 115 gev .",
    "specifically we require the condition to be @xmath132 .",
    "cross sections after imposing all these cuts are presented in columns 5 - 7 in table.[sbaftercuts_7tev ] and table.[sbaftercuts_50tev ] .",
    "once all the above selections are met , the next question is whether there are more choices of cuts that can be used to improve the signal significance .",
    "consider of signal and backgrounds , a forward jet cut is worth being considered .",
    "the forward jet lies very close to the direction of the incoming proton , i.e. , like the z , higgs production via the vector boson fusion(vbf ) through the normal proton proton collision at the lhc .",
    "in contrast to vbf , instead of a jet with large rapidity gap with the forward jet , in our productions , we have the neutrino .",
    "the more massive the heavy particle is , the energy of the forward jet is becoming less , so it lies more close to the proton direction , i.e. , larger rapidity .",
    "this is , however , a good characteristics if our signal is the sm higgs production as discussed in ref.@xcite or heavy higgs production as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "please recall that in our case the sm higgs production is one of the backgrounds .",
    "we thus expect the candidate light jets to be centrally produced .",
    "this selection cut(defined as `` cut8 '' ) which is used to reduce the large rapidity light jets is called the forward jet veto .",
    "we introduce @xmath133 for 7(50)tev .",
    "it has severe impact on the processes of , i.e. , sm higgs jet associated production and z jet associated production , in the forward rapidity region .",
    "the distribution of the forward jet rapidity is displayed in fig.[distributions - mhmtopy][the third two panels ] .",
    "we see the bakz and bakh backgrounds enhance at the range @xmath134 and @xmath135 for 7 tev and 50 tev respectively .",
    "the forward jet veto cut can reduce bakz(bakh ) to 0.017(0.09 ) fb at the 7tev and 0.05(0.33 ) fb at the 50 tev .",
    "typically , this cut can also reduce multi - jet qcd backgrounds , see in table.[sbaftercuts_7tev ] and table.[sbaftercuts_50tev ] , from 0.25 fb to 0.16 fb for the cc production at the 7tev and 1.54 fb to 0.85 fb at the 50tev .",
    "unfortunately , forward jet cut does not have much impact on the single top background .",
    "the final signal significance do not change much for 7 tev , say , 4.2 compare to 4.19 . and",
    "even worse for 50 tev , say , 13.9 to 15.34 .",
    "thus in our final limit analysis we will not use it .    for a short summary and to be clear , we list all the cut - based selections here :    * cut1 : the basic pre - selection cuts in eq.([generator - level - cuts ] ) . * cut2 : the selection @xmath136 * cut3 : missing transverse energy @xmath111 .",
    "* cut4 : the reconstructed top quark mass window @xmath137 $ ] .",
    "* cut5 : the reconstructed w boson mass window @xmath138 .",
    "* cut6 : the reconstructed z boson mass window @xmath139 .",
    "* cut7 : the reconstructed higgs mass window @xmath140 $ ] . * cut8 : the forward light jet veto cut @xmath141 for 7tev and @xmath142 for 50tev ( we do not use this for the final analysis ) .    after imposing all the selections(cut1-cut7 , no cut8 ) , the signal(total background )",
    "turn to be 0.137(0.93 ) fb and 1.29(5.8 ) fb for 7 and 50 tev respectively .",
    "we see the final select efficiency for the signal(@xmath143 ) respect to the sample is about @xmath144 . at the end of the cut - based analysis",
    "we obtain a signal significance @xmath145(defined in eq.([ss ] ) ) of 4.19(15.34 ) correspond to the full backgrounds with @xmath146 integrated luminosity . from table.[sbaftercuts_7tev ] and table.[sbaftercuts_50tev ] we also find that after applying all the selections , the most important contribution to the combinatorial background is still the single top(bakt ) background which stands for 40 - 60 percent of the total .",
    ".[sbaftercuts_7tev ] expected cross sections in unit of fb after different combinations of cuts for signal ( @xmath105 ) and backgrounds at the lhec .",
    "@xmath147 is evaluated with @xmath146 integrated luminosity .",
    "the lhec colliding energy is the 7 tev proton with a 60 gev electron beam . here",
    "the b - tagging efficiency is @xmath108 .",

    "the @xmath145 can be improved to 4.921(16.934 ) with the identical conventions and parameter sets if the mva framework is applied .",
    "our results show that , at a 7 tev lhec with a 60 gev electron beam and 1000 @xmath3 luminosity , the expected limit on @xmath148 can be probed down to 0.113(0.093)@xmath5 with the cut - based(mva based ) analysis at the 95@xmath5 confidence level . for the 50 tev lhec , these limits can be probed down to 0.03(0.022)@xmath5 . here",
    "the b - tagging efficiencies , charm and light jet mis - identification rates are chosen to be 0.6 , 0.1 , and 0.01 respectively .",
    "we also quantify the impact of light , charm jet mis - identification rates and b - tagging efficiencies on the discovery potential .",
    "for instance , for @xmath108 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the signal significance can be improved to be larger than @xmath151 at 50 tev lhec .",
    "the limits are expected to improve if the mva framework is applied .",
    "we also present a detailed comparison between our study and the critical limits obtained by the experiments and by some other phenomenological studies .",
    "our results are better than the most stringent constraint of @xmath152@xcite and @xmath153@xcite@xcite at 95@xmath5 c.l . from the cms and atlas collaborations .",
