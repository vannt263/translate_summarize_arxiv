    "when galaxies approach one another , their mutual gravitational attraction can result in substantial disruptions to their morphologies , such as tidal arms , counter arms , bridges and tails .",
    "many studies have shown , both analytically and using numerical simulations , that galaxies of similar mass can provoke dramatic disturbances in the stellar distributions of one another , with the details depending on the orbital parameters of the interaction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational perturbations can also redistribute the gas content of galaxies , potentially leading to changes in their star - formation properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these effects are strong functions of pair separation , and hence should be most obvious after the galaxies first pass , and particularly around times of closest approach .",
    "many interactions are ultimately likely to result in the complete morphological transformation of the galaxies involved ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , more subtle effects are expected both earlier , while the galaxies are on their initial approach , and at times of wide separation between passes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the expected strength and prevalence of pair interactions mean they are potentially important for determining the properties and evolution of the galaxy population .",
    "it is therefore critical that we test our theoretical expectations of the effects of such interactions by studying representative samples of interacting systems .",
    "furthermore , we may utilise the observed frequency of interacting pairs to discriminate between the details of cosmological galaxy formation models .    a relatively straightforward , and physically motivated , definition of ` interacting ' galaxies is a pair for which the tidal force experienced across one of the galaxies , averaged over its internal dynamical time , @xmath6 , is at least some specified fraction of the gravitational force binding the outer regions of that galaxy , @xmath7 . by this definition",
    ", all interacting pairs should produce significant internal dynamical effects , which would have otherwise been absent , in at least one of the member galaxies . in practice , however , it is difficult to measure the forces involved . we may estimate them by studying the effects of an interaction , but the relative orientations and types of the galaxies in each pair , as well as observational limitations , lead to large variations in the apparent effects for interactions of a given strength , @xmath8 .    a more convenient definition , which is roughly equivalent ,",
    "although only statistically applicable , is that a pair are ` interacting ' if their gravitational influence upon one another could have observable effects in a favourable orientation and mix of galaxy types .",
    "for example , a pair of elliptical galaxies might not display signatures of an interaction in a given observation , but would still count as ` interacting ' by this definition if the tidal forces they are experiencing would have been sufficient to produce an observable signature in a pair of spirals .",
    "the observational details of a particular dataset therefore fix the minimum @xmath8 probed .",
    "this definition removes much of the incompleteness associated with only considering pairs with observational signs of interaction , but of course only a fraction of such interacting galaxies will possess observational signatures . as we shall see later in this paper , it is nevertheless possible to constrain the fraction of galaxies interacting according to this definition .",
    "studies of galaxy pairs typically discuss close pairs , bound pairs , merging pairs , or pairs with observational disturbances , but often mix the usage and definitions of these classes .",
    "interacting pairs are closely related to bound pairs , for which the sum of the gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy of the pair is negative . however , not all interacting pairs are bound , particularly where both are part of a larger system , such as a galaxy cluster .",
    "likewise , not all bound pairs will be experiencing significant tidal interactions .",
    "interacting pairs are also closely related to mergers .",
    "galaxies in bound pairs will typically merge on relatively short time - scales if they are experiencing significant tidal interactions , as the kinetic energy of the pair orbit is transferred to deforming and heating the internal mass distribution of each galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we can identify close pairs of galaxies which are likely to be sufficiently near to one another such that they are interacting ( and potentially bound and will eventually merge ) using projected distance and line - of - sight velocity @xcite .",
    "however , this approach suffers from significant contamination and incompleteness ( with respect to the above definitions of physically meaningful interacting , bound or merging selections ) , due to a lack of full spatial information and the inverse relationship between relative velocity and separation for loose pairs ( i.e. very close pairs can have very large relative peculiar velocities , so appear significantly separated in redshift space ) .",
    "observational signatures of interactions , for example visual classifications , quantitative morphological measurements or induced star formation , may be used to improve the selection of truly interacting galaxies . however , as often one wishes to study the physical effect of interactions , one must be careful to avoid a circular argument .",
    "the early atlases of @xcite and @xcite clearly demonstrated that interactions between galaxies can have profound effects on their morphologies , providing examples of bridges , tails , distorted spiral patterns , and other features .",
    "these morphological changes where observed between pairs up to over 100 @xmath1 kpc , as is the case for the bridging filament of arp 295 .",
    "the restricted three - body simulations of @xcite clearly demonstrated that these features are the result of strong tidal forces between the interacting galaxies .",
    "that galaxy interactions can also induce star - formation was first suggested by @xcite , who found that the scatter in the ubv colours of interacting galaxies from the arp atlas was significantly larger than normal galaxies from the _ hubble atlas _ @xcite .",
    "similar evidence for interaction induced star - formation has also been found over a wide range of the energy spectrum , from near - uv to radio ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "studies which use quantitative measures of morphology find signs of interaction at fairly small projected separations . using the cas method of @xcite to measure galaxy asymmetry ( @xmath9 ) and concentration ( @xmath10 )",
    ", @xcite found that both these quantities increase , relative to isolated galaxies , for galaxy pairs with separations less than the photometric diameter of the primary .",
    "@xcite reliably identified interacting pairs with projected separations up to @xmath11 @xmath1 kpcusing @xmath12 and visual confirmation , for a sample of pairs with line - of - sight velocity differences @xmath13 km s@xmath14 .",
    "kpcas necessary . ]",
    "similarly , @xcite show that asymmetry increases for @xmath11 @xmath1 kpcfor a sample of pairs with @xmath15 km s@xmath14 .",
    "meanwhile , studies which probe the effects of tidal interaction through star formation modulations find changes up to larger projected separations .",
    "@xcite demonstrate an increase in star formation at at @xmath16 @xmath1 kpcfor early and mixed type pairs , and at @xmath17 @xmath1 kpc(their maximum separation probed ) for late type pairs .",
    "they also find that pairs with @xmath18 @xmath1 kpcshow a strong increase in central concentration , suggestive of nuclear starbursts .",
    "@xcite find a star formation increase for close pairs , with star formation rate ( sfr ) enhanced by a factor of @xmath19 at @xmath20 @xmath1 kpcto a factor of @xmath21 at @xmath22 @xmath1 kpc .",
    "this strong dependence on @xmath23 , is contrasted with a weak dependence on luminosity ratio , with the star formation enhancement being strongest in lower luminosity galaxies .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite all find a strong increase in sfr for @xmath24 @xmath1 kpc , while @xcite also see a smaller increase up to at least @xmath25 @xmath1 kpc(their maximum separation probed ) for @xmath15 km s@xmath14pairs .",
    "there is also evidence that equivalent levels of tidally induced star formation require smaller @xmath23 in denser environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some of the variation in the separation scale at which different studies begin to see the effects of tidal interactions is likely due to differences in the mass and luminosity ranges of the samples , as well as the methods used . however , it appears clear that the effects of tidal interactions are found at larger projected separations when identified by induced star formation ( up to @xmath26 to @xmath27 @xmath1 kpc ) , compared to quantitative measurements of asymmetry ( up to @xmath28 @xmath1 kpc ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite , which used simulations to show that quantitative morphological methods for finding merging galaxies , such as @xmath9 , gini and @xmath29 , are most sensitive for galaxies undergoing close passages and during the post merger phase .",
    "induced star formation , on the other hand , will be evident between passes , when the galaxies achieve a wide separation before falling back towards one another , or in galaxies which have experienced a close encounter but will not merge .",
    "note that in dry mergers there may be no star - formation signature of the interaction , and morphological features will typically only be observable for short times @xcite .",
    "as mentioned previously , interacting galaxies can produce distinctive morphological features such as tidal arms , counter arms , bridges and tails , which are best classified visually .",
    "these features are extremely reliable for discriminating truly interacting galaxies from interlopers in close pair catalogues .",
    "features such as two loosely - wound tidal arms may not be detectable by quantitative morphology methods because these galaxies may not appear to be sufficiently asymmetric or disturbed , especially between the first and second pass when the galaxies may appear to be widely separated .",
    "one of the advantages of using visual morphological classifications over automated methods is the ability to identify very faint and subtle features .",
    "tidal features are known to become rapidly undetectable as a function of time and survey imaging depth ( e.g. , @xcite ) , however we find that the galaxy zoo classifications used in this paper are extremely sensitive to faint features .",
    "furthermore , as we will show , by studying the occurrence of such features in a statistical sense , and making weak assumptions concerning the observability of physical interactions , we are able to make decisive statements concerning the prevalence of interactions .",
    "the visual classification of peculiar , disturbed and interacting galaxies has a long history , beginning with @xcite .",
    "the catalogues of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite complied together a significant number of galaxies with obvious tidal features .",
    "such work continues to be valuable today , for example @xcite uses visual classifications of galactic bridges and tails in the cfht legacy survey to study the evolution of the galaxy interaction fraction ( gif ) with redshift .",
    "these galaxies were either isolated merger remnants or fairly close interacting pairs , due to their requirement that galaxy pairs be connected by a bridge .",
    "@xcite and @xcite visually classified a subsample of @xmath30 bright galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) imaging of sdss galaxy objects , finding that @xmath31 per cent of galaxies in their nearby magnitude - limited sample show morphological indications of interaction . @xcite",
    "provide an impressive catalogue of detailed visual classifications for over @xmath32 bright sdss galaxies , which includes information regarding tidal tails and other indicators of interaction .",
    "the galaxy zoo project has enabled visual classification to be performed for extremely large samples , allowing the continued use of this valuable technique with modern surveys .",
    "@xcite obtained the marked correlation function for the galaxy zoo 1 merger classification likelihood and found that it increases sharply in their closest @xmath23 bin ( of 170 @xmath1 kpcwidth ) , and found evidence that most of this increase was for pairs with @xmath22 @xmath1 kpc .",
    "taking an alternative approach , @xcite and @xcite imposed thresholds to select galaxy zoo 1 galaxies with high merger classification likelihoods and study their frequency and properties .",
    "most of these galaxies are either highly disturbed systems or very close pairs . while these studies have been successful at identifying a subset of interacting pairs , they primarily select galaxies which have relatively small projected separations and so do not typically identify interacting pairs which are at large projected separation between their first and second close passes .",
    "in this paper we use visual classifications from galaxy zoo 2 to study what morphological changes are taking place in interacting galaxy pairs as a function of physical projected separation ( @xmath23 ) and line of sight velocity difference ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we then use these results to estimate the frequency of pair galaxy interactions in the local universe .    in section [ data ]",
    "we describe the data set and sample selection , in section [ method ] we outline the methods employed , in section [ results ] we present our results , and in section [ disc ] we summarise our results and discuss their implications .",
    "a @xmath34 cosmology is assumed throughout , with @xmath35 = 0.7 , @xmath36 = 0.3 , and @xmath37 km s@xmath14mpc@xmath38 .",
    "although there have been many attempts at completely automating morphological classification , visual inspection remains the preferred method for many astronomers .",
    "however , for the large samples produced by modern surveys , visual classification is not feasible for a normal research team to perform in a reasonable time .",
    "galaxy zoo @xcite is an online citizen science project designed to address this problem , by involving large numbers of the public in classifying the morphological features of galaxies .",
    "the original galaxy zoo website collected classifications for nearly one million galaxies from sdss data release 6 ( dr6 ; @xcite ) , which were processed to produce catalogues of visual classifications together with estimates of their accuracy .",
    "these data have been released to the public , and are described in @xcite .",
    "the original galaxy zoo ( gz1 ) was limited to coarse morphological classification . following its success ,",
    "a subsequent project was launched , this time collecting much more detailed morphological information via a question tree , for a subset of @xmath39 of the brightest galaxies from galaxy zoo .",
    "this project , named galaxy zoo 2 ( gz2 ) , ran from 16 february 2009 until 22 april 2010 and collected @xmath40 classifications ( comprising a total of @xmath41 questions ) by @xmath42 participants for @xmath43 galaxy images .",
    "both gz1 and gz2 used @xmath44 composite colour images provided by the sdss , created following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "these were displayed such that each galaxy had the same apparent size .",
    "see @xcite for additional discussion of the gz2 dataset .",
    "figure [ gz2flow ] presents the classification tree used for gz2 , including the actual button images shown to the gz2 participants .",
    "these images attempt to symbolise the answer to each question .",
    "most of the participants have no formal astronomy training and , although there is a tutorial which presents real examples for each answer , it is likely that they rely on these images to a reasonable degree while making their classifications .",
    "the gz2 sample selection includes @xmath45 galaxies from sdss dr7 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 and located in the contiguous north galactic cap region30,000 galaxies from both the normal- and coadd - depth imaging of the sdss stripe 82 region , but these data are not used in this paper . ] . in this paper",
    "we require redshift information , and therefore restrict our sample to galaxies with spectra in dr7 .",
    "the overall spectroscopic completeness of this gz2 sample is @xmath48 per cent . as in @xcite",
    ", we limit our sample of galaxies to @xmath49 to ensure sufficient resolution for spiral classifications and thereby reduce somewhat the redshift classification bias discussed in @xcite . a lower redshift limit of @xmath50 is imposed to avoid the de - blending of large nearby objects into multiple photometric objects by the sdss pipeline , and ensure that redshift - derived distance moduli are sufficiently accurate . applying these limits results in a sample of @xmath51 galaxies .",
    "we make use of the mpa - jhu dr7 median stellar mass measurements , which are based on fits to the sdss photometry , following the methods of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this study we focus on galaxy pairs with stellar mass ratios between 1:1 and 4:1 . these would amount to major mergers , if the interaction were to proceed that far .",
    "the candidate galaxy pairs in our parent sample are selected to have an absolute line of sight velocity difference of @xmath52 km s@xmath14and a projected physical separation ( converted from an angular separation using the average redshift of the pair ) of @xmath53 @xmath1 kpc .    to probe the effects of changing @xmath33 between pairs we divide our sample into @xmath27 km s@xmath14bins for @xmath13 km s@xmath14 , as well as two larger @xmath33 bins with @xmath54 km s@xmath14and @xmath55 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath55 km s@xmath14pairs serve as our control sample , as they should all be physically unassociated .",
    "these are used to account for biases that result in a dependence of some morphological classifications on the projected separation of galaxies , irrespective of any true interaction .",
    "they also indicate the typical level of morphological features present in the general galaxy population , for comparison with our pair samples .",
    "note that pairs with @xmath56 km s@xmath14have a significantly different luminosity distribution ( skewed to more luminous galaxies ) compared to the lower @xmath33 samples .",
    "this is a result of @xmath33 approaching the velocity range of the survey , and hence the sample becoming dominated by more distant , intrinsically brighter galaxies .",
    "we judge the @xmath55 km s@xmath14range to be a good compromise between maintaining consistent luminosity selections , while maximising the control sample size and minimising its contamination by physically associated pairs .",
    "gz2 participants are asked a series of questions for each image , with each answer determining the subsequent question , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ gz2flow ] .",
    "we record the individual answers provided and , after some down - weighting of the most inconsistent participants , use these to construct a catalogue .",
    "this catalogue gives the total number of times each galaxy was presented and , for each question , the fraction of votes for each possible answer , which we denote @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath57 for all @xmath9 belonging to a single question must , of course , sum to unity . to give a concrete example , consider that a given galaxy has been presented to 20 participants , 16 of which answered ` features or disk ' to the initial question ` is the galaxy simply smooth and rounded , with no sign of a disk ? ' .",
    "this galaxy thus has a vote fraction of @xmath58 .",
    "the 16 participants who answered _ features _ were then asked ` could this be a disk viewed edge - on ? ' , with 12 answering ` no ' , and thus @xmath59 .",
    "all these 12 were subsequently asked ` is there a sign of a bar feature through the centre of the galaxy ? ' , resulting in a split of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "again , all 12 were then asked ` is there any sign of a spiral arm pattern ? ' , with a ` yes ' answer fraction of @xmath62 .",
    "the question tree continues , and we have only considered the route through the question tree taken by the majority , but this is sufficient for the reader to fully understand both the traversal of the question tree and the definition of @xmath57 .",
    "the vote fraction @xmath57 may , very roughly , be considered to represent probabilities regarding a galaxy s morphology . the uncertainty expressed by these probabilities results from a combination of limited observational information , true morphologies which do not precisely align with the possible answers , and differing interpretations by each participant in judging the correspondence between the image and each answer . in this case",
    "@xmath63 , the conditional probability of the galaxy having morphological feature @xmath9 given that it possesses the set of morphological features @xmath64 , since each participant must have identified the galaxy as having the preceding features in the question tree , @xmath64 , in order to be asked about feature @xmath9 .",
    "the conditional probability compares the likelihood of a galaxy having feature @xmath9 against the alternative answers for a single question .",
    "however , it does not necessarily give a good representation of the presence of a particular morphological feature .",
    "an object may have a high @xmath57 , but still be unlikely to possess morphological attribute @xmath9 . to assess the overall likelihood of @xmath9",
    ", one may calculate an estimate for the joint probability of @xmath9 and @xmath64 .",
    "formally this is , @xmath65 where @xmath66 are subsets of the set of answers @xmath64 partitioned by question , and the @xmath67 are the individual answers in @xmath66 .    as we do not distinguish between the different paths which lead to a given question ( though this would be possible to do from the raw data ) , we only consider cases for which @xmath64 represents the sum of all possible paths to answer @xmath9 . in this case , we denote @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the probability of morphological feature @xmath9 together with any @xmath64 for which asking the question with answer @xmath9 is relevant , as defined by the question tree in fig .  [ gz2flow ] .",
    "remember that these probabilities only include the observational information available in gz2 , so do not necessarily equate to the true probability of a particular morphology feature .",
    "for example , for a galaxy which has @xmath70 or @xmath71 , the value of @xmath72 does not take into account the unobservable ( in terms of gz2 ) presence of spiral arms in apparently smooth or edge - on galaxies .    for the example above ,",
    "@xmath73 whereas , @xmath74 this indicates that there is only a moderate probability that the object in question has visible spiral arms , although if one is willing to accept that it does have features and is not edge - on , then it probably does possess spiral arms .",
    "notice that the _ bar _ question has been implicitly omitted from this calculation as all its possible answers continue on to the _ spiral _ question , and hence it would contribute a factor of @xmath75 = 1 $ ] .    whether one works with @xmath57 or @xmath69 depends upon the question one is considering .",
    "it is particularly useful to examine trends in terms of @xmath57 itself , as this reflects the behaviour of a specific morphological feature , irrespective of other morphological variations .",
    "however , due to the limited total number of times each object is considered , when @xmath69 is low , @xmath57 will be highly quantised and subject to high poisson noise . in this case",
    ", one can consider only objects for which @xmath57 is meaningful , by imposing a minimum threshold on @xmath76 , which we denote by @xmath77 , for some threshold @xmath78 .    to study the dependence of @xmath57 on projected separation ( @xmath23 ) for a particular sample",
    ", we take the mean vote fraction @xmath57 in each bin of @xmath23 , @xmath79 where the sums are over the @xmath80 galaxies in each @xmath23 bin for that sample .",
    "this is done for each of the answers , @xmath9 , shown in fig .",
    "[ gz2flow ] .    for many answers",
    "we find that the control sample displays a dependence on @xmath23 .",
    "given their velocity separation , these trends can not be due to any physical interactions within the pairs .",
    "instead they must arise from the apparent close projection of the galaxies , and may be considered to be a ` projection bias ' , which will contaminate any signature of physical interaction in the lower @xmath33 pairs . in order to remove this contamination , we remove the control sample trends versus @xmath23 from the observed trends for the other pair samples . if we regard the @xmath81 as conditional probabilities , the control sample trend may be removed by , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the conditional probability in the absence of the projection bias , @xmath84 is the measured conditional probability for a sample of physically associated pairs , and @xmath85 is the measured conditional probability for the control sample . @xmath86 therefore represents the conditional probability , @xmath87 , of morphological feature @xmath9 being observed as a result of the galaxy being in a pair with separation @xmath23 , given that the galaxy displays morphological features @xmath64 .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath86 are given by , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are determined from the standard error of @xmath85 and @xmath84 in each @xmath23 bin .",
    "note that for physically associated pairs , with low @xmath33 , the projected galaxy density increases as @xmath23 decreases , such that the number of galaxies in a given @xmath23 bin , and hence the signal - to - noise of @xmath81 remains reasonably constant .",
    "however , for unassociated pairs the projected galaxy density is constant as a function of @xmath23 , and thus at small @xmath23 the signal - to - noise of @xmath81 drops substantially .",
    "unfortunately , this limits the accuracy of the projection bias correction and translates into higher uncertainties in @xmath86 at low @xmath23 .    in order to quantify the strength and scale of the trends",
    ", we fit the @xmath86 with the function , @xmath91 where @xmath67 is the size of the change in @xmath83 from large to small @xmath92 , @xmath93 specifies the @xmath92 scale of the trend , and @xmath94 accounts for possible constant systematic offsets between the physically associated pairs and control sample .",
    "we find that this simple empirical function is able to well represent most of the @xmath95 trends we observe .",
    "ideally @xmath94 should be zero , and in any case , for @xmath95 to represent a probability , @xmath96",
    ". however , systematic offsets of @xmath94 in either direction are possible due to small differences in the sample selections of physically selected pairs and the control sample .",
    "these are difficult to avoid for different @xmath33 selections , but should not have an @xmath23 dependence , justifying the use of a simple constant to account for them .",
    "reassuringly , we find that @xmath94 is generally very close to zero , signifying that sample selection differences are indeed minimal .",
    "the fitting method provides uncertainties on @xmath67 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which enables us to judge the significance of differences in the trends between samples and plot confidence intervals on the fitting functions .",

    "we leave all of these challenges for future work . a paper using the methods outlined above , to explore the dependence of the interaction frequency on stellar mass and environment , is in preparation .",
    "in this paper we have examined a variety of morphological signatures of interaction between galaxy pairs , and demonstrated how the trends in these observable features , as a function of projected separation , can provide a refined estimate of the frequency of pair interactions in the galaxy population .",
    "we consider an ` interacting ' galaxy to be one which has experienced a significant tidal force , compared to its gravitational binding force , averaged over the previous dynamical time ( see section [ intro ] ) . the tidal force deemed ` significant '",
    "depends upon the properties of a given observational dataset .",
    "we began by presenting our sample and the methods we employ , and particularly , in section [ morphprob ] , discussing the information provided by galaxy zoo 2 and its interpretation in terms of the probability that a given galaxy is observed to possess a particular set of morphological features .",
    "we also presented a method to correct for ` projection bias ' , an effect whereby the signal of certain morphological features may depend on the apparent separation of galaxy pairs , even in the absence of any possible physical associations between pair members .    in section [ oddclass ]",
    "we considered questions from gz2 designed to identify _ odd _ features , including answers , such as _ merger _ , which were intended to identify signs of interaction .",
    "we found that these classifications suffer from a strong projection bias .",
    "for example , galaxies with small projected separation , but very large velocity offsets , tend to have a spuriously large _ merger _ signal . furthermore , the way in which the question for these _ odd _ features was arranged , allowing only one of the available options to be selected , results in cross - talk between the _ odd _ categories , in terms of both true signal and projection bias , which complicates their interpretation .",
    "we find that this projection bias is also present for the gz1 _ merger _ classification , and shows a behaviour very similar to its gz2 equivalent .",
    "previous studies which used the gz1 _ merger _ class to identify merger candidates @xcite will have suffered to some degree from this issue , but the effect is probably relatively small due to their use of vote fraction thresholds and the fact that the low-@xmath33 galaxy pairs have a larger mean _ merger _ vote fraction at most projected separations relative to the control sample pairs . in future iterations of galaxy zoo , and other visual classification efforts , it would be preferable to keep questions regarding different types of features distinct , or allow multiple answers to be selected for a single question when the relevant features are not mutually exclusive .",
    "nevertheless , the _ odd _ classifications do provide useful information on the reality of galaxy interactions , particularly once a correction for the projection bias is applied by reference to a control sample of pairs with large velocity offsets . as discussed by @xcite with relation to gz1 , the gz2 _ merger _ class ( and also _",
    "odd = yes _ ) primarily selects interacting galaxies at small projected separations .",
    "it therefore mainly probes close passes and the later stages of mergers .",
    "we further find that the _ irregular _ and _ disturbed _ classes can identify interacting galaxies with very small projected separations , which may be either at an advanced stage of merging or aligned along the line - of - sight .",
    "we have searched all the gz2 classifications for trends with projected separation , and find significant signals with respect to the presence and form of spiral arms .",
    "the observability of spiral arms ( _ spiral = yes _ ) , and particularly the dominant _ 2 arms _ class , is enhanced for close pairs on a scale of @xmath16 @xmath1 kpc .",
    "@xcite find that the spiral - to - elliptical ratio for galaxies classified as mergers in gz1 is approximately twice the global ratio , and in @xcite conclude that this is due to the longer time - scale over which spiral mergers are detectable compared to elliptical mergers .",
    "our results show that this ratio can also be at least partly explained by the enhancement and formation of spiral arms in interacting galaxies .",
    "more unusual spiral arm features also present a trend with @xmath23 .",
    "the occurrence of _ one arm _ spirals dramatically increases for small separations ( on a scale of @xmath129 @xmath1 kpc ) , while _",
    "loose winding arms _ show the strongest increase ( operating on an intermediate scale of @xmath22 @xmath1 kpc ) .",
    "there are two principal ways in which spiral - like features can be created through tidal interactions .",
    "tidal perturbations can instigate or amplify instabilities in gas disks , leading to the formation or enhancement of star formation in spiral arms similar to those seen in isolated galaxies ( e.g. , as seen by @xcite ) .",
    "tidal forces can also strip stars and gas out of the galaxies , forming tidal tails , counter tails and bridges , which may or may not harbour star - formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we appear to detect both signatures : an enhancement of ` normal ' spiral arm features , occurring at large projected separations , with the signatures of stronger tidal interactions becoming increasingly prevalent at smaller separations .",
    "the tidal nature of the _",
    "loose winding arms _ features is confirmed by examination of typical images , such as those in table [ lwaimages ] .",
    "it is clear that many of the galaxies which have significant probability of _ loose winding arms _ , especially those with higher stellar mass , are red , early - type galaxies .",
    "this indicates that the loose spiral features that are observed in these galaxies , and probably also those same features in star - forming , late - type galaxies , are the result of tidal stripping . in galaxies with sufficient cold gas ,",
    "there will almost certainly be star formation in these tidal spiral features , and indeed in table [ lwaimages ] we see that several of the galaxies possess very blue loose spiral arms . simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicate that tidal features , such as those apparently identified by the gz2 _ loose winding arms _ class , are indicative of a stage between close passes , primarily between 1st and 2nd pass , when pairs can still attain relatively large separations .",
    "loose winding arms _ features are thus probing the early stage of mergers and pair interactions .",
    "the onset and appearance of tidal arms are known to depend on the geometry of the encounter .",
    "numerical studies demonstrate that in - plane , prograde encounters produce the most symmetrical two - sided disturbances , while polar encounters give the most one - sided disturbances , and retrograde encounters are the last to make tidal tails ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "retrograde encounters also produce the greatest increase in star formation efficiency @xcite . considering this , the galaxies which are selected as having _ 2 arms _ and _ loose winding arms _ in gz2 are likely the result of prograde , in - plane encounters , while galaxies identified as displaying _ 1 arm _ are likely the result of polar or retrograde encounters .",
    "our observed separation scales for these different features are consistent with this interpretation ( see table  [ fitparam ] ) .    when comparing our results to other studies which look at the onset of tidally induced changes in interacting galaxies , we find that answers to galaxy zoo questions regarding spiral arms detect changes at separations similar to studies of tidally induced star formation , as discussed in section [ intro ] .",
    "loose winding arm _ class begins to detect interacting galaxies around @xmath174 @xmath1 kpc , which is similar to the separation scale associated with induced star formation @xcite .",
    "the star formation detected at these large separations is relatively weak , while a strong increase is observed for @xmath175 @xmath1 kpc@xcite .",
    "this corresponds to scale for which we observe an enhancement of the _ merger _ class .",
    "quantitative morphological measurements also typically present signals on these scales @xcite .",
    "logically , kinematic disturbance must precede morphological disturbance and so it might seem that star formation , if it is triggered by kinematical perturbations , should be an earlier indication of interaction than morphology ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , this paper shows that some morphological signatures are as sensitive as enhanced star - formation , and more unambiguously related to interaction .    in section",
    "[ bars ] we found that the likelihood of a bar being observed decreases sharply for pairs with projected separations @xmath129 @xmath1 kpc .",
    "bars are thought to be created through periodic orbital resonance @xcite and are known to initiate radial gas inflows , which in the end act to destroy or weaken the bar structure @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite , or more comprehensively @xcite ) .",
    "gas inflows , perhaps together with the enhancement of bar features , caused by tidal perturbations in the early stages of major interactions may similarly act to rapidly destroy any pre - existing or transient bars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our results suggest that this is indeed the case , with the appearance of bars being strongly suppressed in close pairs , in agreement with other recent studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "eventually , the violent reorganization of stellar orbits in the later stages of many major interactions ( i.e. mergers ) must act to erase any orbital resonances which created the bar .    in section [ probpairs ]",
    "we focus on using the presence of _ loose winding arms _ to identify probable interacting galaxies .",
    "these criteria are then used in section [ interlopers ] to constrain the frequency of galaxy pair interactions , without requiring an arbitrary cut - off in projected separation or any further corrections for contamination of our close pair sample .",
    "we find that the fraction of galaxies with @xmath4 and @xmath176 that are in truly interacting pairs with @xmath13 km s@xmath14is in the range @xmath177@xmath178 per cent .",
    "the limits correspond to assuming the maximum and minimum permitted probability , @xmath149 , that interacting galaxies produce observable _ loose winding arms _ features , respectively .",
    "we expect simple extensions of our technique to lead to significantly tighter confidence intervals in future work .",
    "it is difficult to precisely compare our estimate of the interacting galaxy fraction to other studies , due to the range of different methods employed .",
    "although the close pair fraction is mostly constant with luminosity @xcite , the limiting mass - ratio and projected separation , varying definitions for selecting pairs , and many other subtleties , make comparisons complicated .",
    "given that the estimate in this paper is derived from a relatively simple demonstration of combining close pair and morphological information , we defer such involved comparisons to future work .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the major interaction fractions quoted by other recent studies : e.g. , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 by @xcite , respectively , are neatly bracketed by our estimate of 0.4  2.7 per cent .",

    "<S> we use galaxy zoo 2 visual classifications to study the morphological signatures of interaction between similar - mass galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey . we find that many observable features correlate with projected pair separation ; not only obvious indicators of merging , disturbance and tidal tails , but also more regular features , such as spiral arms and bars . </S>",
    "<S> these trends are robustly quantified , using a control sample to account for observational biases , producing measurements of the strength and separation scale of various morphological responses to pair interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we find that the presence of spiral features is enhanced at scales @xmath0 @xmath1 kpc , probably due to both increased star formation and the formation of tidal tails . on the other hand , the likelihood of identifying a bar decreases significantly in pairs with separations @xmath2 @xmath1 kpc , suggesting that bars are suppressed by close interactions between galaxies of similar mass .    </S>",
    "<S> we go on to show how morphological indicators of physical interactions provide a way of significantly refining standard estimates for the frequency of close pair interactions , based on velocity offset and projected separation . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of loosely wound spiral arms is found to be a particularly reliable signal of an interaction , for projected pair separations up to @xmath3 @xmath1 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we use this indicator to demonstrate our method , constraining the fraction of low - redshift galaxies in truly interacting pairs , with @xmath4 and mass ratio @xmath5 , to be between 0.4  2.7 per cent .    </S>",
