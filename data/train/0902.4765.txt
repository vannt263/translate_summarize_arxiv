    "our experience suggests that the symmetry in the time is disrupted and the future and the past play different roles .",
    "the world surrounding us has obvious irreversible nature .",
    "however , poincare showed that  @xcite the description of the irreversibility is impossible on the basis of the classical laws of dynamics , since the latter are reversible in time .",
    "the equations of quantum mechanics are reversible too .",
    "the description of the physical world on the basis of fundamental classical and quantum theories as defined by the laws of the nature is determined to be time reversible .",
    "difference between the classical description of the nature and those processes in the nature which we observe creates the conflict situation .",
    "therefore the problem of the description of irreversible world on the bases of the reversible equations of classical and quantum physics is raised .",
    "i will not discuss the solutions of this problem in classical physics , i will examine the quantum mechanics .",
    "first of all it is necessary to note that the question about irreversibility of quantum processes can be examined in connection with the problem of interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "briefly , i will examine two most important approaches - copenhagen and everett s interpretations .",
    "+ copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics asserts that we can not  speak about the quantum properties of the system before these properties are measured  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "in other words , quantum theory describes not quantum world but the fact that we can speak about quantum world after measurement .",
    "let the energy of the quantum system has two values @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 corresponding wave functions .",
    "if the system is described by the wave function @xmath5 it is possible to present it in the form of the superposition of the functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 : @xmath6 . before measurement the wave function @xmath5 occupies simultaneously two levels and energy of the system does not have a specific value . only after the measurement we will obtain the values @xmath1 or @xmath2 with probabilities @xmath7 , @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the passage from the `` potential possibilities '' which are described by the wave function @xmath5 to the `` actual realities '' , which can be measured , is called reduction or collapse of the wave function .",
    "the physical process leading to collapse is called quantum decoherence .",
    "the process of the measurement leads to the abrupt , irreversible change of the state .",
    "any measurement is not a reversed process .",
    "thus , irreversibility appears when the measurement is carried out . in this case",
    "the behavior of the quantum system is described by neumann s postulate of reduction  @xcite which , however , does not answer the question which _ dynamic processes _ lead to irreversibility .",
    "thus , in accordance with copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics the observed processes proceeding in the world are caused by our measurements including , for example , the quantum transitions .",
    "however , as prigogine notes , since the quantum transitions are the basic mechanism of chemical reactions it is difficult to agree with the latter assertion .",
    "is it possible to consider the chemistry as the result of our observation ?",
    "if yes , then who observed the chemical reactions which led to the appearance of life  @xcite ?",
    "+ another interpretation of quantum mechanics is proposed by h. everett ( relative state interpretation )  @xcite .",
    "it was developed in the works  @xcite ,  @xcite ( many - world interpretation ) ;  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ( extension of everett s concept ) .",
    "many - world interpretation allows the existence of the infinite numbers of classical realities : each term of quantum superposition corresponds to one classical world . according to the extended everett",
    "s concept the measurement entangles the measured system with the environment , however , linear superposition is not destroyed .",
    "thus , after measurement the linearity of quantum mechanics is preserved . in this case the reduction of the wave function does not occur .",
    "however , at the specific moment of time the observer sees only one result of the measurement  -  the one classical world .",
    "this occurs because the consciousness of the observer divides the state of quantum world into the classical realities which he receives independently .",
    "the consciousness of the observer subjectively makes the selection of one alternative .",
    "the consciousness continuously creates classical reality  @xcite . hence follows : the classical world is the illusion , reduction of the wave function is the illusion too , since they appear subjectively in the consciousness of the observer . in the approach ,",
    "the concepts of the `` arrow of time '' and irreversibility are rather connected with its subjective feeling of the observer then with the objective property of material itself .",
    "it is assumed , the further study of this interpretation will be possible after the construction of the model of `` quantum consciousness '' , which is discussed in the work  @xcite .",
    "+ obviously , the approaches examined above contain a subjective , anthropomorphic element .",
    "the interpretations contain a basic distinction between the quantum system and the observer .",
    "the latter fact is undesirable for the theory since it takes us away from the solution of the basic problem : the determination of the objective laws of the nature ( if we believe in the objectivity of the nature ) .",
    "if copenhagen interpretation is the direct consequence of the insufficient realization of the physical sense of the basic postulates of quantum mechanics , then everett s interpretation is a natural consequence of them .",
    "this situation impels one to the alternative formulation of quantum dynamics which does not appeal to the observer excluding the subjective , anthropomorphous element . in the approach",
    "the irreversibility must be represented as the property of material itself and is not defined by the active role of the observer .",
    "+ in the paper i examine the alternative formulation of quantum dynamics in the framework of the brussels - austin group works that has been headed by i. prigogine for many years . in the works , a possible variant of description of nonequilibrium processes at microscopic level in the frame of the liouville space extension of quantum mechanics",
    "is investigated .",
    "the mechanism of the asymmetry of processes in the time which made it possible to accomplish a passage from the reversible evolution to irreversible one was developed .",
    "thus , new irreversible dynamics with the disrupted time symmetry was formulated .",
    "the symmetry in the time disrupted as a result of asymmetric nature of the physically permissible states .",
    "+ at the present moment , it is necessary to continue further development of the brussels - austin group approach in the framework of the realistic models of interaction .",
    "then , the irreversible evolution of a charged spin @xmath0 particle interacting with a magnetic field is investigated on the basis of subdynamics theory . in the work",
    "the survey of the basic principles of the brussels - austin group is carried out . in section 2",
    "the eigenvalue problem is discussed .",
    "perturbative solution of the schroedinger equation in the framework of complex spectral representation is given .",
    "in section 3 the liouville formulation of quantum mechanics is represented .",
    "the task of the complex spectral representation of the liouvillian is solved in section 4 . in section 5 the theory of subdynamics",

    "as the first step , in the framework of schroedinger equation , i examine as the asymmetry in time can arise .",
    "i examine the eigenvalue problem for the hamiltonian @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 - free hamiltonian , @xmath12 - interaction part , @xmath13 - coupling constant . in the conventional case ,",
    "hamiltonian @xmath14 is a hermitian operator , @xmath15 is a perturbed energy of the state - a real number .",
    "it is known that the usual procedure of equation   solution on the basis of perturbation method can lead to the appearance of the denominators @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the energies corresponding to the unperturbed situation .",
    "obviously , the divergences can arise at @xmath19 .",
    "the basic question now is - what we can do to avoid the divergences , when @xmath20 .",
    "i examine the situation using the simple friedrichs model  @xcite ( the model is presented closely to the text of the works  @xcite  -  @xcite ) . despite the fact , that the solution of the problem for the friedrichs model is known it serves as a good example for the demonstration of the essence of situation .",
    "the model describes interaction of two level atom and electromagnetic field . in the friedrichs model",
    "@xmath21 corresponds to the atom in its bare exited level  @xcite ,  @xmath22 corresponds to the bare field mode with the atom in its ground state .",
    "the state @xmath21 is coupled to the state @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 here @xmath25 or @xmath26 . in the ordinary approach the eigenvalue problem for the hamiltonian @xmath14",
    "is formulated as follows @xmath27 for the eigenstate @xmath28 ( for small @xmath29 ) perturbation method gives the expression @xmath30 if @xmath31 , divergences appear at @xmath32 .",
    "i. prigogine and co - workers noted that in the general case the satisfactory solution of this problem is impossible on the basis of the conventional formulation of quantum dynamics .",
    "however , the eigenvalue problem can be solved if the time ordering of the eigenstates will be introduced .",
    "this procedure can be realized through the introduction into the denominators imaginary terms : @xmath33 for the relaxation processes , which are oriented into the future and @xmath34 for the excitation processes , which are oriented into the past . in this case",
    "the eigenvalue problem   is reduced to the complex eigenvalue problem @xmath35 where we must distinguish right - eigenstate @xmath36 and left - eigenstate @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "@xmath38 is a complex @xmath39 here @xmath40 is a renormalized energy and @xmath41 is a real positive value .",
    "this procedure makes it possible to avoid the divergences and leads to the following expressions for the eigenstates @xmath36 , @xmath37  @xcite @xmath42 @xmath43 in the expressions   and   the designation @xmath44 has been referred to as `` delayed analytic continuation ''  @xcite and can be determined through the integration with a test function @xmath45 .",
    "for example , @xmath46 where we first have to evaluate the integration on the upper half - plane @xmath47 and then the limit of @xmath48 must be taken .",
    "thus , the approach makes it possible to solve the problems which could not be solved within the framework of classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "now we can realize the program of heisenberg - to solve task at the eigenvalues which could not be solved within the framework of traditional methods .",
    "the spectral representation of the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath49 for the eigenstates we have relations @xmath50 since , @xmath14 is hermitian the corresponding eigenstates @xmath36 , @xmath37 are outside hilbert space , have no hilbert norm @xmath51 and furthermore have a zero average energy @xmath52 the eigenstates @xmath36 , @xmath53 are called `` gamow vectors '' .",
    "extensive literature is dedicated to the study of `` gamow vectors '' , for example  @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "+ thus , the hermiticity of @xmath14 leads to the fact that `` usual '' norms of eigenstates @xmath36 , @xmath54 disappear .",
    "however , the eigenstates @xmath36 , @xmath55 have a broken time symmetry .",
    "we can associate @xmath36 with the unstable state , which vanishes for @xmath56 , @xmath57 corresponds to the state , which vanishes for @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 however , the are few unpleasant aspects .",
    "+ using the eigenvectors @xmath36 , @xmath57 it is possible to construct the density operators  @xcite @xmath61 they are invariants of motion and they do not describe the process of relaxation .",
    "in addition , `` unusual '' norms and zero average energy  ,   exist .",
    "+ these are the reasons why a more general space of density matrix - liouville space will be examined .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to emphasize : the complex perturbative solution of the eigenvalue problem in the framework of the schroedinger equation makes it possible to determine @xmath41 which has important physical sense .",
    "the value @xmath62 determines the probability of transition between two quantum states  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
