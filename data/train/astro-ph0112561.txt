    "according to the most promising cosmological scenarios , structure formation is traced back to the evolution of primordial density fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations , originated from quantum fluctuations@xmath7@xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath8@xmath12 in an inflationary phase of the early universe , grew up through gravitational instability to a maximum radius @xmath13 . at the time @xmath14 corresponding to maximum expansion , perturbations broke away from the general expansion and at @xmath15 them began to collapse .",
    "hence the collapse of perturbations onto local density maxima of the primordial density field has a key role in structure formation and several studies deal with this problem .",
    "the problem of collapse has been investigated from two points of view , namely :    \\i ) that of the statistical distribution of the objects formed@xmath12@xmath8@xmath16    \\ii ) that of the structure of these objects and its dependence on the statistical properties of the primordial density field@xmath17@xmath8@xmath18@xmath10@xmath19@xmath8@xmath20 @xmath21@xmath8@xmath22@xmath10@xmath23@xmath8@xmath24 @xmath25@xmath8@xmath26@xmath10@xmath27@xmath8@xmath28 @xmath29@xmath8@xmath30@xmath10@xmath31@xmath8@xmath32 @xmath33 .    in the spherical accretion model introduced by hoyle and narlikar@xmath34 and applied to clusters of galaxies by gunn & gott@xmath35 , the matter around the core of the perturbation is a homogeneous fluid with zero pressure . if the density inside the perturbation is greater than the critical density , it is bound and shall expand to a maximum radius @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the initial radius and @xmath39 is the overdensity inside the radius @xmath40 .",
    "such matter shall collapse in a time @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hubble parameter at the initial time @xmath43 .",
    "+ this model was introduced in order to overcome the problem of the excessively steep density profiles , @xmath44 , obtained in numerical experiments of simple gravitational collapse .",
    "some authors were able to produce shallower profiles@xmath17@xmath8@xmath45@xmath8@xmath46 , @xmath47 , through the @xmath48 @xmath49 process .",
    "several years later , observational evidences for secondary infall in the outskirts of clusters of galaxies has been reported in ref .",
    "+ even if this model and in general the original form of sim ( secondary infall model ) is able to explain better than previous models the structure of clusters of galaxies it has some drawbacks , ( e.g. it does not predict the right structure of density profiles ) , that can be overcome with some improvements in the original model@xmath50 .",
    "two noteworthy limits by the gunn & gott@xmath35 model are the following :    _ a _ ) it neglects tidal interaction of the perturbation with the neighboring perturbation ;    _ b _ ) it neglects substructure existing in the outskirts of proto - galaxies or proto - clusters and in the background .    the effect of the tidal field was studied in a recent paper@xmath51 . in that paper , we showed that the gravitational interaction of the quadrupole momentum of a proto - structure with the tidal field of the neighboring proto - structures introduces another potential energy term in the equation describing the collapse which acts in the sense to delay the collapse .",
    "this effect has revealed as one of noteworthy importance in solving several of the drawbacks of the cdm model@xmath51@xmath8@xmath52@xmath8@xmath53@xmath8@xmath54 , namely :    \\1 ) lack of a mechanism originating the bias@xmath51 ;    \\2 ) discrepancies between :    * a1 ) x - ray temperature function of clusters and observations@xmath52 . * a2 ) two - point correlation function of clusters and observations@xmath52 ; * a3 ) mass function and velocity dispersion function of clusters and observations@xmath54 ; * a4 ) shape of clusters and observations@xmath55 ; * a5 ) angular two - point correlation function of galaxies and observations@xmath53 .    for",
    "what concerns point `` @xmath56 '' , we may say that during the last two decades , astronomers have discovered that at least a third of galaxy clusters are not dynamically relaxed systems but contain substructure on scales of the same order as the cluster itself@xmath55@xmath8@xmath57@xmath8@xmath58 .",
    "this implies that clusters are currently forming or have formed recently enough that they have not had time to undergo significant degree of violent relaxation and phase mixing .",
    "when one studies the structure of the velocity field around a peak one finds that at radii @xmath40 larger than the filtering scale @xmath59 , ( @xmath0 ) , a sensitive fraction of the matter of the peak is gravitationally unbound to it@xmath60 .",
    "this is not surprising since a non zero fraction of unbound matter should be expected even in the case of a uniform system with a maxwellian velocity distribution ( see section 2.2 for a discussion ) .",
    "the encounters between collapsing clumps and the unbound high velocity clumps influence the collapse of the proto - cluster .",
    "we want to study this point and to compare its effect on cluster collapse with that produced by the effects of tidal interaction of the protocluster with the neighboring ones .",
    "+ in the following we show how the unbound substructures influences the collapse of the perturbation .",
    "the plan of this work is the following : in section  2 we deal with the unbound substructure effects . in section",
    "3 we give our results and finally section   4 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "our cosmological setting is described by a hierarchical clustering scenario , a cdm model ( see ref .",
    "38 ) in which structure formation goes _ bottom - up_. local density extrema are assumed to be the sites of structure formation@xmath61@xmath8@xmath62 .",
    "the perturbations grows linearly until the linearly evolved dispersion @xmath63 of the density contrast is @xmath64 , while it enters in the non - linear phase when @xmath65 .",
    "denoting this epoch by @xmath66 one has : @xmath67 ( liddle & lyth@xmath68 , equation 8.2 ) , where as always the subscript 0 denotes the present value of the linearly evolved quantity and @xmath69 is related to the power spectrum @xmath70 of density fluctuations by : @xmath71 being @xmath72 the filtering scale and @xmath73 the window function : @xmath74}{(k r_{\\rm f})^{3}}\\ ] ] a subgalactic mass scale collapses at a redshift : @xmath75 ( silk & stebbins@xmath76 ) , where @xmath77 is the biasing parameter .",
    "in particular a perturbation of @xmath78 collapses at a redshift @xmath79 while perturbations in the range @xmath80 collapse almost at the same @xmath81 because the mass variance in this region varies only of a factor 3 ( ref .",
    "a part of this last perturbations have a cross section too little for gravitational merging to be destroyed@xmath82 . therefore a mass perturbation @xmath83 ( see ref .",
    "38 ) can survive until the cluster enters non - linear phase at @xmath84 .",
    "+ in order to study the dynamical evolution of the proto - cluster , we use the shell method@xmath51@xmath8@xmath85@xmath8@xmath86@xmath8@xmath87 . if we consider a shell of matter around the centre of the cluster this is made of galaxies , gas and substructure . during the collapse ,",
    "the shell encounters clouds of substructure some of which have high speed .",
    "supposing that the systems subject to the encounter ( the shell of matter and the high speed clumps ) have , respectively , median radii @xmath88 and @xmath89 , velocity dispersions of order @xmath90 , @xmath91 , that at the instant of closest approach their centres are separated by @xmath92 and have relative speed v the condition@xmath93 : @xmath94 ensures that in the course of the encounter the objects constituting the encountering systems barely move from their initial locations .",
    "the result of the encounter is to generate perturbations in the velocity and energy of the objects constituting the shell ( here we are only interested in the effect of the encounter on the shell ) .",
    "in fact the effects of high speed encounters on the internal structure of `` stellar '' systems decrease as the encounter speed increases and consequently high speed encounters generate only small perturbations of otherwise steady - state systems .",
    "+ the conditions expressed in equation ( [ eq : impuls ] ) is known as impulse approximation ( hereafter ia)@xmath95 and yields accurate results often even when the condition is not strictly satisfied . as stressed by gnedin & ostriker@xmath86 ,",
    "the ia works well in the outer region of clusters , wherein galaxies are assumed to move little during the interaction , while the ia is not appropriate in the cluster core .      before going on ,",
    "we want to analyze the applicability of the ia as expressed by equation  ( [ eq : impuls ] ) to our problem .",
    "a first rough analysis can be performed remembering that the escape velocity in the cluster is fixed by the virial theorem according to equation ( see for example ref .",
    "44 , ( equation ( 8.3 ) ) ) : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the escape velocity and @xmath98 is the 3-d dispersion velocity , and @xmath99 being @xmath90 the velocity dispersion of the objects constituting the shell , and then @xmath100 the relative velocity , v , is the sum of the infall velocity of the shell and the velocity of clumps moving outwards : @xmath101 imposing that the clumps move at speed larger than @xmath97 , we get : @xmath102 the infalling shells are marginally bound , hence they travel at a velocity close to the local escape velocity @xmath103 this last statement can be easily proven using for example an hernquist model for the cluster . in general , conservation of energy yields : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the ( negative ) potential and @xmath106 is the maximum ( apocentric ) radius of the infalling particle .",
    "for example , for a hernquist cluster , one has @xmath107 and @xmath108 = v_{\\rm esc}^2(r ) [ 1 - ( r + a ) / ( r_a + a ) ] = v_{\\rm esc}^2(r ) ( r_a - r ) / ( r_a + a)\\ ] ]    for a hernquist model , @xmath109 is a few tenths of the virial radius .",
    "the infalling particles are between the virial and turnaround radii , i.e. between @xmath110 and roughly 2 @xmath110 .",
    "so @xmath111 and @xmath112 which means that @xmath113 is a little smaller than @xmath97 .    using the previous results ( equation  ( [ eq : vee])and ( [ eq : vee1 ] ) )",
    ", we have : @xmath114 if @xmath115 , in eq . ( [ eq : impuls ] ) , we are dealing with the shell then : + 1 ) @xmath116 + if @xmath117 , we are dealing with the clump : @xmath118 ( see ref .",

    "44 ( see page 440 ) is considered good to use the ia .",
    "+ we want to remark that the previous analysis does not take account of the reduction of escape velocity with radius : given the potential of the sistem , @xmath121 , the escape velocity is @xmath122 .",
    "this means that going outwards the ia is more strictly satisfied .",
    "the energy change in the shell , due to an encounter with high velocity clumps , can be computed as follows .",
    "+ suppose to have a perturber ( a high speed clump of substructure , member of the cluster ) characterized by a speed larger than the escape speed from the cluster .",
    "this high velocity clump , that we stress is inside and part of the cluster , moves away from it .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates ( r , z ) such that the z - axis coincides with the perturber s trajectory given by : @xmath123 and that @xmath124 is the centre of the perturbed system ( shell of matter ) . note that we are interested only in clumps not contained in the core and moving from the centre in the outward direction , so that they do not go through the cluster centre .",
    "the choice of not taking into account the effect of clumps in the core area is due to gnedin & ostriker@xmath86 observation that the ia works well in the outer region of clusters , wherein galaxies are assumed to move little during the interaction .",

    "each one of the encounters produces an increase of the energy of the shell . in order to calculate the total energy , @xmath143 , acquired during infall",
