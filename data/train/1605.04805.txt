    "( em ) interference , also called radio - frequency ( rf ) interference , has been traditionally treated as a disturbance in the design of wireless communications systems .",
    "however , rf signals carry information as well as energy at the same time . such a dual nature of em interference is stimulating a significant interest in communications systems powered by harvested ambient energy .",
    "in particular , _ ambient backscatter _ has emerged as a novel communication paradigm , where a small passive device can transmit its own data by backscattering the em / rf wave deriving from existing or _ legacy _",
    "communication systems , such as digital tv ( dtv ) broadcasting , cellular systems , or wireless local area networks ( lans ) , e.g. , wi - fi . unlike traditional backscatter systems , such as radio frequency identification ( rfid ) ones @xcite",
    ", ambient backscatter does not require a dedicated reader , which allows for direct device - to - device ( d2d ) and even multi - hop communications .",
    "recently , this new communication paradigm has been receiving much attention @xcite , since it can be embedded into inexpensive objects in order to fulfil the ubiquitous and pervasive communication vision of the internet - of - things ( iot ) @xcite .",
    "the main principles of ambient backscatter were first introduced in @xcite , where also a simple prototype is developed , which harvests dtv energy to achieve d2d communications with rates of @xmath0 kbps over a range of about @xmath1 m outdoor and @xmath2 m indoor . in @xcite , the same principles are exploited to allow a passive device or _",
    "tag _ to directly connect to the internet by leveraging on an existing wi - fi infrastructure .",
    "in particular , in the scenario of @xcite , the tag can establish bidirectional communications with a wi - fi device by modulating the channel state information ( csi ) or received signal strength indicator ( rssi ) of the wi - fi channel ( in the uplink ) or by simple on - off modulation ( in downlink ) , achieving rates of @xmath3 kbps in uplink over a range of @xmath0 m and up to @xmath4 kbps over @xmath5 m in downlink . a significant improvement over this scheme is the backfi system proposed in @xcite , wherein backscatter communications can achieve at least @xmath0 mbps over a @xmath2m - range in uplink , by exploiting the signal cancellation principles of full - duplex systems @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the ambient backscatter approach is extended to systems where the backscatter receiver ( called the reader ) is equipped with multiple antennas ; moreover , a detailed analysis of the system from a signal processing perspective is carried out , by assuming that the wireless channel obeys a frequency - flat block - fading model . since the tag employs low - rate differentially - encoded on - off signaling , the reader can decode its information by employing simple noncoherent detection strategies .",
    "the performance analysis of the approach proposed in @xcite is carried out in terms of bit - error rate ( ber ) , both analytically and by monte carlo simulations .",
    "existing research on ambient backscatter has covered both experimental and theoretical aspects . however , to the best of our knowledge , an investigation of the ultimate performance limits of ambient backscatter , in terms of information - theoretic figures , such as the ergodic or outage capacity , is still lacking .",
    "we aim at filling this gap , by evaluating in this paper the capacity ( i.e. , the maximum achievable transmission rate ) of ambient backscatter communications systems .",
    "our analysis assumes that the legacy system employs a multicarrier modulation , which is ubiquitous in modern communication systems , whereas the backscatter system transmits at lower bit - rates by adopting simple single - carrier techniques .",
    "we evaluate typical information - theoretic figures of merit for both the legacy and the backscatter systems , by assuming a symbol variance constraint for the legacy system and both symbol variance and amplitude constraints for the backscatter one .",
    "our results allow one to assess the maximum data - rate achievable by the backscatter system , and also show somewhat surprisingly that , since the backscatter transmitter acts as a relay towards the legacy receiver , the legacy system can even benefit of ambient backscatter , provided that some reasonable assumptions are met . in other words , ambient backscatter is not only a viable means of opportunistically capitalizing on the energy carried out by rf signals , but it is also a way of turning em interference into a form of diversity .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is introduced in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "general assumptions underlying the performance analysis are pointed out in section  [ sec : assump ] .",
    "the analytical performance analysis is carried out in sections  [ sec : analysis - legacy ] and [ sec : analysis - back ] for the legacy and the backscatter system , respectively .",

    "in this section , we introduce a model for ambient backscatter communications that harvest energy from legacy transmissions : our model builds on the previous works @xcite .    the considered wireless network is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_1 ] : it is composed of a _ legacy _ transmitter - receiver ( ltx / lrx ) pair and a _",

    "the btx is a _ passive _ device , i.e. , it does not include any active rf component , and communicates using only the power that it harvests from the rf signals transmitted by the ltx . finally , the brx may be either passive or might use typical active rf electronics to demodulate the signal backscattered by the btx .",
    "the ltx adopts a _ multicarrier _ modulation scheme with @xmath9 subcarriers .",
    "the block of data to be transmitted by the ltx within the @xmath10th ( @xmath11 ) frame of length @xmath12 is denoted as @xmath13^{\\text{t}}\\in { \\mathbb{c}}^m$ ] , whose entries are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",

    "the entries of @xmath48 are subject to d / a plus rf conversion for transmission over the wireless channel .",
    "on the other hand , due to its power limitation , the btx transmits in a narrower bandwidth with respect to the legacy system ( higher data rates consume more power and energy ) .",

    "it is noteworthy that one symbol is transmitted by the btx per each frame of the legacy system .",
    "since the btx is passive , it can not initiate transmissions on its own .",
    "once the ltx transmits the block @xmath48 , the em wave propagates toward the btx . when the wave reaches the btx , its antenna is excited and the rf power is converted to direct current ( dc ) power through a _ power harvester_. this dc voltage is then able to power the control logic on the chip , whose task is to modulate the reflected em wave .    regarding the @xmath55 link , a frequency - selective and quasi - static channel model is assumed .",
    "specifically , during an interval of duration @xmath56 , the channel impulse response spans @xmath57 sampling periods @xmath58 ; hence , the resulting discrete - time channel @xmath59 is a causal system of order @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",

    "the assumption @xmath67 ensures that the sum of the to and the channel order turns out to be within one frame , such that the @xmath10th received block is impaired only by the ibi of the previous frame . ] the baseband - equivalent block received by the btx within the @xmath10th frame can be written as _",

    "it is worth noticing that the last @xmath69 rows of the matrix @xmath70 are identically zero , that is , the interblock interference ( ibi ) contribution is entirely contained in the first @xmath71 entries of the received vector @xmath72 .    in our ambient backscatter framework , the btx acts as a digital multilevel modulator , mapping each information symbol onto a set of @xmath49 waveforms by means of a proper variation of its chip impedance @xcite .",
    "to elaborate upon this point , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2 ] reports the equivalent thvenin circuit @xcite of the btx front - end , where the sine wave generator @xmath73 models the sinusoidal voltage induced by the power density of the incident em field , @xmath74 is the antenna impedance , and @xmath75 are @xmath49 distinct values of the btx chip impedance , for @xmath76 .",
    "the maximum power available from the generator is given by @xmath77 .",
    "at the reference plane denoted by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2 ] , due to the impedance discontinuity , two power waves are generated : a _ ( nonreflecting ) forward wave _ propagating to the right and a _ ( reflecting ) backward wave _ giving rise to the backscattered field .",
    "when the switch @xmath78 is closed , i.e. , the chip impedance of the btx takes on the value @xmath79 , the average power harvested by the btx is given @xcite by @xmath80 @xmath81 , where depends on the chip impedance that , in its turn , depends on the chip input power .",
    "a linearized model is herein assumed for the power wave reflection coefficient @xcite , according to which @xmath82 does not depend on the incident power . ] _ q = [ eq : refl_coeff ] is the _ power wave reflection coefficient _ @xmath83 . the squared magnitude @xmath84 of the power wave reflection coefficient is referred to as the _ power reflection coefficient _",
    "@xcite : it measures the fraction of @xmath85 that is not delivered to the chip of the btx .",
    "it is worth noticing that , if @xmath86 ( _ impedance matching condition _ ) , then @xmath87 : in this case , the tag achieves maximum average power harvesting @xmath85 and , in theory , there is no backscattered field .",
    "hence , an impedance mismatch @xmath88 is necessary to reflect part of the energy from the btx antenna back to the intended recipient brx .",
    "the symbol sequence @xmath89 can be embedded in the backscattered signal by carefully choosing the chip impedances @xmath90 .",
    "each chip impedance in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2 ] corresponds to a point of the symbol constellation @xmath91 .",
    "more precisely , to produce impedance values realizable with passive components , all the power wave reflection coefficients @xmath92 are confined in the complex plane within a circle centered at the origin with radius smaller than or equal to one .",
    "these coefficients are then scaled by a constant @xmath93 such that _ q = _ q ( q ) [ eq_gamma_symbol ] with @xmath94 .",
    ".   establishes a one - to - one mapping between the information symbols of the btx and the power wave reflection coefficients of its chip .",
    "such a mapping is generally referred to as _ backscatter _ or _",
    "load modulation _ @xcite .",
    "the choice of @xmath95 governs the harvesting - performance tradeoff of the backscatter communication process .",
    "indeed , values of @xmath95 closer to one allows the btx to reflect increasing amounts of the incident field back to the brx , resulting thus in greater backscatter signal strengths ( i.e. , for a target symbol error probability at the brx , larger communication ranges ) . on the other hand , values of @xmath95",
    "much smaller than one allow a larger part of the incident field to be absorbed by the rf - to - dc conversion circuits of the btx , hence improving power conversion ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) at the expense of backscatter signal strength .",
    "we note that @xmath97 accounts for the case when the backscatter system is in sleep mode and , hence , only the legacy transmission is active .",
    "once @xmath95 and @xmath91 have been chosen in accordance with certain criteria @xcite and , thus , the power wave reflection coefficients are identified through , the chip impedances @xmath90 corresponding to the designed signal constellation can be obtained from as follows z_q^ = ( q ) [ eq : impedance ] where @xmath98 is a given parameter . in practice , some constraints may be imposed on the chip impedances : for instance , to use high - quality electronic components and/or reduce the physical size of the btx , it might be required to use resistors and capacitors , by hence eliminating inductors @xcite .    according to the antenna scatterer theorem @xcite ,",
    "the em field backscattered from the antenna of the btx can be divided @xcite into load - dependent ( or _ antenna mode _ ) scattering and load - independent ( or _ structural mode _ ) one : the former component can be associated with re - radiated power and depends on the chip impedances of the btx , whereas the latter one can be interpreted as scattering from an open - circuited antenna .",
    "therefore , with reference to antenna mode scattering and accounting for , the @xmath99th baseband - equivalent @xmath58-spaced sample backscattered by the btx during the @xmath10th frame of the legacy system assumes the expression @xmath100 @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is a discrete random variable assuming the values @xmath92 , whereas @xmath103 is the symbol transmitted by the btx during the @xmath10th frame .",

    "for such a reason , we assume that the corresponding cfos are equal and can be accurately estimated and compensated at the lrx through conventional techniques @xcite .",
