    "about almost half a century ago , bogoliubov proposed an interesting model of baryons @xcite , which assumes that they are composed of quarks bound by a linearly raising potential , as suggested by gauge theories . with the help of a single phenomenological parameter , the string tension @xmath4 ,",
    "this model is able to qualitatively account for the ( dynamically generated ) mass of the nucleon , for the corresponding magnetic moment , and for the mass - radius .",
    "the quark - meson coupling model due to guichon @xcite incorporates successfully the quark degrees of freedom into a many - body effective hamiltonian , inspired on qcd .",
    "the aim of the present note is to obtain a phenomenological description of hadronic matter in the framework of a combination of both models .",
    "the quark potential has been derived by baker et al @xcite using a dual - superconductor picture of qcd .",
    "the distribution of gluon fields has been investigated on the lattice by bissey et al .",
    "@xcite , who have shown that the potential increases linearly with the length of the string , and that the y shape configurations of the gluon flux - tube distribution is more favorable than the l or t configurations . in the y shape",
    "the strings join at some point localized inside the triangle defined by the quarks . in the l shape ,",
    "one of the quarks is at the point where the strings join . in the t shape ,",
    "the point where the strings join is on the line segment defined by two quarks .",
    "there are similarities and differences with bogoliubov s model .",
    "since this model is an independent quark model , in it all shapes , l , t y , defined by the positions of the quarks , have the same energy , provided the sum of the distances to the origin is the same , this being the difference . however , the potential energy increases linearly with the length of the string , or with the distance to the origin , this being the similarity .",
    "moreover , in bogoliubov s model , the phenomenological string tension turns out to be about 1/4 of the string tension in the lattice theory .",
    "according to bogoliubov s proposal , the nucleon , regarded as a system of three independent valence quarks is described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath5where the components of @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the dirac matrices related to the quark @xmath8 and @xmath4 is the string tension . for simplicity",
    ", a coulomb term @xmath9 , which is included in the so called quarkonium cornel potential , has been omitted .",
    "the model is admittedly incomplete since it does not accommodate the hyperfine structure and so is unable to describe the nucleon  @xmath10 mass splitting .",
    "however , such a refinement is beyond the scope of the present note . in the presence of a static magnetic field",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the charge of the quark @xmath8 and @xmath13 is the potential vector .",
    "the square of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath14 reads @xmath15 it is convenient to introduce the operator @xmath16+\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\bfsigma_r&0\\\\0&\\bfsigma_r\\end{matrix}\\right ] \\kappa,\\ ] ] which is related to @xmath17 by a unitary transformation .",

    ", we may identify the mass of the quark with the square root of the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath22 , that is , with @xmath23 .",

    "if center of mass corrections are not considered , the lowest eigenvalue is identified with the quark mass squared .",
    "@xmath34      center of mass corrections must be considered . as previously observed , the correction for the center of mass ( cm ) motion is implemented by subtracting the expectation value of the cm momentum squared from the expression for the square of the nucleon mass .",

    "the mass squared of the nucleon should be identified with @xmath42 . taking into account center of mass correction , means subtracting @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain @xmath43 @xmath44so that the correct expression reads @xmath45where @xmath46 the quantity @xmath47 being the center of mass correction for each quark , so that , in this approximation , the quark mass becomes @xmath48 . setting @xmath49 mev , we find @xmath50 mev@xmath51 .",
    "the nucleon mass radius which is derived from the expectation value of @xmath52 is too big due to the fluctuation of the nucleon cm .",
    "a reasonable value is obtained if , instead of the expectation value of @xmath52 , one compensates for the cm motion and considers the expectation value of @xmath53 .",

    "the effective quark mass at saturation density is denoted by @xmath101 .",
    "the outputs are summarized in table 1 .",
    "it is challenging to compare the nucleon effective mass , as predicted by the present version of the qmc model , and by the walecka and the zimanyi - moszkowski models @xcite , with respect to the dependence on the scalar field .",
    "we consider the expression of the effective mass in terms of the scalar coupling @xmath102 in the walecka model , the relation @xmath103 holds .",
    "the mass of the free nucleon is set equal to 1 . in the derivative coupling model ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we find @xmath104 in the simple version of the qmc model obtained in the present formulation , eq .",
    "( [ new0 ] ) , we have , to a good approximation , a close expression to the previous one , if cubic and higher terms in @xmath105 are neglected . according to both the present version of qmc and the bag version of qmc ( cf.@xcite ) these terms are very small .",
    "in particular , in the present version , it turns out that the coefficient of the squared term in an expansion of the effective mass is an order of magnitude less than it is in the zm model .",
    "specifically , keeping in mind that in the groundstate the expectation values of @xmath106 and @xmath107 are equal , and taking @xmath108 , we find that : @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",

    "the difference shows up in the ratio @xmath119 , between the incompressibility and the binding energy @xmath120 . in the weak coupling limit",
    ", we have in lowest order , @xmath121 for the present version of qmc , and @xmath122 for zimanyi - moszkowski model .",
    "thus for the same binding energy , the present version of qmc leads to a slightly larger @xmath123 than zimanyi - moszkowski model .",
    "the incompressibility of 235 mev which is found , is close to the value of 225 mev of the derivative coupling model , and the effective mass is 0.85 for both models . for the more realistic version , eq .",

    "matter at low densities and temperatures is a system of nucleons composed of quarks bound by a linearly raising potential , as suggested by gauge theories , according to the bogoliubov model of baryons @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the model have been fitted to the saturation density and the binding energy of symmetric nuclear matter at this density , and the quark mass in vacuum .",
    "as output the incompressibility of matter and the effective nucleon mass at saturation were calculated respectively with values 249.1 mev and 0.8 @xmath124 .",
    "the string tension which is obtained with bogoliubov model turns out to be less than one fourth of the string tension which is found in the lattice calculation @xcite .",
    "however , this model is incomplete since it does not account for the mass splitting between the nucleon and the resonance .",
    "if the model is refined in this direction , following , for instance , @xcite , a higher string tension , closer to @xmath125 gev @xmath126 may be obtained .",
    "such improvement is left for a future publication .    on the other hand",
    ", it may be observed that this model is suggested by the string concept and leads essentially to a 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator , since the operator @xmath17 may be approximated by @xmath22 .",
    "the failure of the model in accounting for the correct string tension is , perhaps , the price one has to pay for the approximate treatment of the string force .",
    "indeed , the bogoliubov model is based on the idea that the quarks move independently in a three dimensional potential .",
    "now , a string is a one - dimensional object . if we replace the 3-dimensional oscillator by a 1-dimensional oscillator , the value of the string tension which reproduces the quark mass increases .",
    "indeed , consider the 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath127 .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue of this operator , which must be identified with the quark mass squared , is @xmath4 .",
