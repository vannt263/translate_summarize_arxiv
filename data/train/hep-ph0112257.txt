    "among a hundred nonleptonic two body decays of b mesons , the process @xmath3 has lots of interests in many aspects : first of all , it was firstly observed color - suppressed process with a large branching ratio in b meson decays.@xmath4 the vector - vector decays @xmath5 is a mixture of cp - even and cp - odd eigenstates since it can proceed via an s , p , d wave decays . by using both angular and time distribution analysis ,",
    "we can separate the cp - even one from cp - odd eigenstate and determine the angle @xmath1 of the unitarity triangle without any dilution effects in a manner similar to which the cp - odd eigenstate @xmath6 is used . in addition",
    ", the angular distribution analyses on both @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be used to resolve 4-fold ambiguities in the measurement of @xmath9 .",
    "the recent measurement by babar@xmath10 has confirmed the earlier cdf@xmath11 observation that there is a nontrivial strong phase difference between polarized amplitudes indicating final - state interactions .",
    "however no such evidence has been seen yet by cleo@xmath12 and belle@xmath10 .",
    "it is interesting to check if the current qcd - approaches for b hadronic decays predicts a departure from factorization .",
    "therefore , the measurements of various helicity amplitudes in @xmath13 decays will provide a powerful tool for testing factorization and differentiating various theorical models@xmath14 in which the calculated nonfactorizable term have real and imaginary parts .",
    "on the other hand , precise measurement of the cp asymmetry in the @xmath15 decays is important for new physics search by comparing with one of @xmath16 with high degree of accuracy.@xmath17 this measurement is experimentally accessible at the early stage of the asymmetric @xmath18 factories .",
    "the @xmath19 decays arise from penguin ( loop ) effects , while the @xmath20 decays involve dominant tree amplitudes .",
    "the search for different cp asymmetries in the @xmath15 and @xmath21 decays , with the common source from @xmath22-@xmath23 mixing , provides a promising way to discover new physics @xmath24 : a difference of @xmath25 would be an indication of new physics .",
    "the measurement of @xmath26 has a four - fold ambiguity : @xmath27 with @xmath28 . in order to resolve this ambiguity ,",
    "one need to determine the signs of @xmath29 and @xmath30 in addition to the value of @xmath31 .",
    "using interference between opposite cp amplitudes in @xmath32 and @xmath33 can help to determine the sign of @xmath29 .",
    "the interference term between cp - even and cp - odd amplitude which can be obtained from the transversity analysis contains a term in @xmath29 .",
    "for instance , @xmath34 \\sim & &   im[a_{\\perp}(0)a_{||}^{*}(0 ) ] \\,\\ , cos\\triangle mt \\nonumber \\\\ & & - re[a_{\\perp}(0)a_{||}^{*}(0 ) ] \\eta \\ , cos2\\phi_1 \\,\\ , sin\\triangle mt . \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] observables in transversity frame for @xmath35 is given by in table i.    since experiments measured interference terms in the angular distribution with re@xmath36 , im@xmath37 and im@xmath38 , there exists a phase ambiguity with @xmath39 : @xmath40 it is easy to check that there is a sign ambiguity on @xmath41 $ ] and on @xmath42 .",
    "therefore a sign ambiguity on @xmath43 remains .",
    "there are two solutions for the relative phases according to babar measurement@xmath10 as an example : @xmath44 where the phases are measured in radians .",
    "the other allowed solution is @xmath45 as pointed out by suzuki @xmath46 , the solution ( [ i ] ) indicates that @xmath47 has a sign opposite to that of @xmath48 and hence @xmath49 , in contradiction to what expected from factorization .",
    "therefore , we prefer to solution ( [ ii ] ) to compare with the factorization approach . obviously there is a 3-@xmath50 effect that @xmath51 is different from @xmath52 and this agrees with the cdf measurement@xmath12 .",
    "however , such an effect is not observed by belle@xmath53 and cleo@xmath11 ( see table 4 ) .",
    "in fact , we can determine unambiguously the strong phase of @xmath43 term by studying the angular distribution analysis of @xmath54 with su(3 ) flavour symmetry @xmath55 .",
    "the determination of @xmath56 leaves the ambiguity of @xmath57 .",
    "however , it needs some model - dependent input . by comparing the coefficients of @xmath58 of @xmath59 vs @xmath60",
    ", we obtain : @xmath61\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can give the @xmath56 if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are known",
    ". the @xmath64 could be determined by method(2 - 1 ) .    the determination of @xmath63 need model - dependent input .",
    "@xmath65 if @xmath66 , we obtain the relation : @xmath67 = sign[cos\\,2\\phi_1 \\,\\ , sin\\phi_1]\\ ] ] in standard model @xmath62 is positive .",
    "by using the angular distribution analysis in the transversity basis , we can measure precisely both their magitudes and phases of the three different helicity amplitudes , denoted by @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "these observations can provide a crucial way to test not only the naive factorization method but also recent improved qcd - approaches in which non - factorizable term can be calculable . also it would answer the question of the existence of the final state interactions , which is strong enough to flip the quark spin in color - suppressed b decays@xmath46 .",
    "it has been well known that the factorization approach ( naive or generalized ) fails to explain simultanuously the production ratio @xmath71 and the fraction of longitudinal polarization @xmath72 in @xmath73 decay@xmath74 .",
    ".the ratio of vector meson to pseudoscalar production @xmath75 and the longitudinal polarization fraction @xmath72 in @xmath20 decays calculated in two representative form - factor models using the factorization hypothesis .",
    "[ tab2 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as shown in table 4 , we obtained small @xmath76 which can explain only half of the data for the branching ratio .",
    "we also got relatively small fraction of the longitudinal polaization component , but large fraction for @xmath77 .    from somehow negative results ,",
    "we conclude that it is needed to understand more correctly the lcdas of heavy ( @xmath78)-state and the power @xmath79 corrections within qcd - factorization method .    to get more understanding on factorization in color - suppressed decays including charmonium states",
    ", we suggest that the study on @xmath80 will provide a good test of the factorization hypothesis.@xmath81 we expect @xmath82 , which can be observed in near future .",
