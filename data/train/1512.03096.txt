    "probably the first explanation for the present acceleration of the universe came from quantum field theory : here the energy of the vacuum quantum fluctuations gives rise to a cosmological constant and thus a cosmological term in the einstein equations .",
    "however , this model yields a disagreement of more than 100 orders of magnitude between the measured value of the cosmological constant and the theoretical zero - point energy as obtained from perturbative quantum field theory within the standard model , leading to its description as being  the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics \" @xcite . in the theoretical procedure employed we would like to emphasize the word  perturbative \" , which means that the calculation is done by perturbative techniques .",
    "the problem of these perturbative calculations is that without a cutoff the zero - point fluctuations yield an infinite gravitational energy , whereas a cutoff at the planck scale leads to the planck energy density which is @xmath0 bigger than the measured cosmological constant .",
    "currently there are many models for explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe : a cosmological constant ; quintessence ; modified gravity models ; ideas from string theory like brane cosmology ; etc .",
    "( for details on this problem see , for example , the reviews @xcite-@xcite . )",
    "many of these models are based on using some fields which effectively lead to the acceleration .",
    "the essential difference of such models from the model based on the assumption that the cosmological constant corresponds to the energy of quantum fluctuations is that in the first case we must have some field equation(s ) describing such ( an ) additional field(s ) , whereas in the second case some field ( gauge field , spinor field ) is in the ground state and quantum fluctuations around this state lead to the appearing of the cosmological constant . while this is an advantage for such a point of view , the calculations in perturbative quantum field theory lead to a huge discrepancy between this theoretical value and the observed value of the cosmological constant .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that the nonperturbative vacuum in quantum field theory has a good chance to yield the cosmological constant .",
    "the idea presented here is as follows .",
    "let us imagine that we can : ( a ) construct a gravitating nonperturbative model of an extended object in quantum field theory ; ( b ) calculate the gravitational field created by this object .",
    "the object itself consists of vacuum fluctuations of non - abelian gauge fields , that are present in the standard model .",
    "then the structure of such an object can be as follows : it possesses a core inside the cosmological event horizon and a tail outside the horizon .",
    "the core and the tail are filled with vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the boundary between the core and the tail is given by the cosmological event horizon indicating that we have obtained a cosmological constant originating from the nonperturbatively quantized fields .",
    "here we follow refs .",
    "@xcite where an approximate nonperturbative quantization procedure was applied to modeling a glueball . to begin with ,",
    "let us consider the su(3 ) lagrangian in quantum chromodynamics @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the su(3 ) index ; @xmath3 is the field strength operator ; @xmath4 ; @xmath5 is the coupling constant ; @xmath6 are the su(2 ) indices ; @xmath7 are the coset indices , and @xmath8 are the su(3 ) structure constants .    in order to obtain an approximation yielding a nonperturbative description of a glueball ,",
    "we assume that    * expectation values of non - abelian gauge fields inside a glueball are zero ; * 2-point green functions of gauge fields can be approximately represented through two scalar fields @xmath9 ; * the behavior of the @xmath10 and coset @xmath11 components is different ; they are described by different scalar fields  @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; * 4-point green functions can be approximately decomposed as the product of 2-point green functions ; * the expectation value of the product of an odd number of gauge potentials is zero .",
    "thus we assume that it is possible to approximately describe these quantum fields in the form of two scalar fields , where one of them ( namely @xmath12 ) describes @xmath14 gauge fields , and the other one ( namely @xmath13 )  the coset @xmath11 gauge fields .",
    "the next step is to obtain some effective lagrangian for these two scalar fields .",
    "this is done by performing the quantum averaging of the initial su(3 ) lagrangian . here",
    "we assume that the 2- and 4-point green functions are described in terms of these scalar fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 by using the following relations : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the su(2 ) indices , @xmath17 are the coset indices , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are closure constants . equations and imply that the expectation value of odd products is zero .",
    "note here that because of the positivity of the relations , and , the squares of the scalar fields @xmath9 should be less than @xmath20 , respectively . the effective lagrangian then becomes @xmath21 the procedure of obtaining the effective lagrangian from the initial lagrangian is similar to what happens in turbulence modeling when one gets the reynolds equation starting from the navier - stokes equation @xcite .",
