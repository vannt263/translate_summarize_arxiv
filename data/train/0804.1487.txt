    "gravitational lensing is a highly useful phenomenon in astrophysics .",
    "it allows us to study faint galaxies that have been magnified , and can be used for a variety of cosmological constraints .",
    "for example , a strong lens forming multiple images of a background source allows us to determine the mass distribution of the lensing object ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , the discovery of a substantial number of lens systems makes it possible to study the potential wells of lensing galaxies in a statistical way .",
    "the lensed galaxy itself is magnified , allowing us to study its properties in detail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when a background quasar is strongly lensed , this magnification sometimes makes the host galaxy visible @xcite .",
    "the statistics of strong lenses allow constraints on the cosmological parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including models of dark energy @xcite .",
    "because of the importance of gravitational lensing systems , there have been many systematic studies of them and surveys for them .",
    "in particular , strong gravitational lensing of quasars has been studied systematically by the castles collaboration @xcite , the class @xcite , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite . while various surveys of galaxy lensing have been carried out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many discoveries of lensed galaxies have been serendipitous , such as the discovery of the lensed galaxy cb58 at z=2.7 @xcite .",
    "systematic searches for strongly lensed galaxies have been also made in the fields of massive clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , hst wfpc2 images were used to find giant arcs around galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained deep images of 240 rich galaxy clusters selected from sdss , discovering 16 new giant arc systems .",
    "these giant galaxy cluster lenses allow us to determine the mass distribution on scales of several hundred kpc .",
    "the large volume spectroscopic survey of the sdss @xcite allows systematic searches for galaxy - galaxy lenses . @xcite and @xcite searched for objects whose spectra show features of both low - redshift ellipticals and higher - redshift emission lines .",
    "deep hst imaging confirms that the foreground elliptical is lensing the background galaxy .",
    "this method has discovered enough strong lensing cases to allow a statistical study of lensing galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "using sdss imaging data , @xcite serendipitously discovered a lensed lyman break galaxy at z = 2.73 around a lensing galaxy at z = 0.38 .",
    "the lensing galaxy of this lens system has an sdss spectrum , which does not show any features of the lensed background galaxy because the separation between the lensing galaxy and the lensed image is larger than the 15 radius of the spectrograph fiber .",
    "this lens therefore did not enter the @xcite sample .",
    "these discoveries suggest an automated search for galaxy lenses in wide - field imaging data .",
    "several recent studies have used automatic image analysis techniques to find strong lenses in deep images @xcite . @xcite",
    "have also applied a similar method to sdss images to find giant arcs around clusters of galaxies .",
    "these methods use the characteristic arc shape of lens images by calculating the ellipticity or the length - to - width ratios of objects in the imaging data .",
    "these arc - shape detection programs can find a hidden compact ring around a lensing galaxy , as shown by @xcite .",
    "however , strong lensing detection based on the shape of objects has several difficulties .",
    "first , this kind of survey depends on several parameters that are tuned for an optimal detection rate .",
    "for example , when the properties of the images such as signal - to - noise ratio and seeing change , the parameters have to be retuned before the codes are applied to the new images .",
    "second , it does not work well when the images are not deep enough to show a bright arc shape , even if the lensed galaxy is quite visible .",
    "third , it is computationally demanding to process massive quantities of wide field image data with shape detection codes when we want to search all lensing possibilities around all elliptical galaxies . a simpler method to search for",
    "strong galaxy - galaxy lensing would be valuable .",
    "we find that a lensing search based only on a photometric catalog can be used to detect strong galaxy - galaxy lenses in sdss images , even though they are not deep enough to show the full morphology of lensed arcs .",
    "all sdss imaging data are processed by an automated pipeline @xcite . measured parameters of detected objects including multi - band magnitudes and correlations with neighboring objects are archived to a database from the pipeline .",
    "indeed , the photometric catalog has enough information to allow us to separate the rare lenses from other objects .    in this paper",
    "we show the first results of our search for strong galaxy - galaxy lenses in sdss .",
    "we explain the candidate selection strategy in the following section . in  3 , we present follow - up observational data of the first confirmed lensing object , sdss j082728.70 + 223256.4 .",
    "a possible lens model is given in  4 .",
    "the properties of the lensing galaxy are described in  5 .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in  6 . in this paper",
    "we focus on demonstrating the use of a multi - band photometry catalog to find lensing systems .",
    "we are still refining our selection algorithm , so we will quantify the completeness of our sample and give details of our final candidate selection method in a subsequent paper .",
    "the sdss produces a photometric catalog in five bands using a 2.5 m telescope equipped with 30 ccds @xcite as well as a spectroscopic catalog of objects selected from the imaging data .",
    "the properties of all objects detected above 5 @xmath5 in at least one band over the @xmath6 imaged to date are measured by a dedicated pipeline @xcite and are calibrated photometrically @xcite and astrometrically @xcite .",
    "we use the fifth public data release @xcite in selecting lens candidates .",
    "since most possible lensing galaxies are early - type galaxies because of their large velocity dispersions @xcite , we assume that lensing galaxies are red galaxies in the sdss images . because only the most luminous of those possible lensing galaxies have redshifts above 0.2 @xcite",
    ", we do not restrict our analysis to the sample of objects with redshifts .",
    "our candidate selection method is still being developed , so we only outline the criteria that were used in finding the reported lens system here .",
    "first , we identify all red galaxies in the photometric catalog that have a model magnitude in @xmath7-band @xmath8 23.0 without correction for galactic extinction .",
    "red galaxies are defined using color cuts suggested by @xcite : @xmath9 where we use model magnitudes throughout .",
    "this color cut selects intrinsically red galaxies up to redshift 0.4 .",
    "we next select those red galaxies that have at least two photometric companions between 24 and 36 away , a typical radius of strongly lensed systems , and a large enough separation that the image deblender separates the lens images from the red galaxy .    in order to discriminate a lensing system from a galaxy group or cluster",
    ", we require that the @xmath10 colors of the possible lens images differ by more than two magnitudes from that of the lensing galaxy .",
    "this color difference is much larger than the observed color range of cluster ellipticals .",
    "this color difference cut was adopted to test our preliminary selection method and to reduce possible contamination of neighbor galaxies around red galaxies . while cluster ellipticals are red and tend to be undetected in @xmath11 , background lensed galaxies are often quite blue and have very different @xmath10 colors .",
    "we discuss refinement of this color cut in  5 .    in most strong quadruple lensing systems we expect to find at least two bright knots on one side of the lensing galaxy .",
    "we therefore require that the angle between the two companion objects with respect to the possible lensing galaxy be less than 90@xmath12 .",
    "even though the surface brightness of the arc may not be high enough to appear in the sdss images , the positions of the bright knots are precise enough to check whether the positions of the photometric objects are consistent with a lensing system .    finally , we eye - inspect the objects that satisfy our criteria .",
    "we found 38154 galaxies that satisfy the color cut and have at least one companion with @xmath10 color difference of more than two magnitudes in the separation bin of 24 and 36 . among",
    "the galaxies found , 1644 objects have more than one companion .",
    "but only 38 objects have an angle of less than 90@xmath12 between the two lens images ; these we examine by eye .    from its appearance in the sdss images ( figure 1 ) , sdss j082728.83 + 223253.9 ( g ) was the most promising lensing galaxy in our search .",
    "the basic sdss photometry data are given in table 1 .",
    "the model magnitude @xmath10 color of this elliptical galaxy is 4.48 without galactic extinction correction .",
    "the lensing galaxy is undetected in @xmath11 , as expected for a red elliptical .",
    "therefore , the @xmath10 color of the lensing galaxy should be interpreted as a lower limit . meanwhile , the lens images are deblended as three photometric objects : sdss j082728.87 + 223256.5 ( a ) , sdss j082728.70 + 223256.4 ( b ) , and sdss j082728.86 + 223252.6 ( c ) .",
    "the first two objects are classified as galaxies by the sdss software while the last one is star - like",
    ". the distances of objects a and b from the lensing galaxy are @xmath0 30 , and satisfy our selection criteria .",
    "although image c is also close to the lensing galaxy , its model magnitude in the @xmath7-band is fainter than 23 mag , and therefore was not selected by our criteria .",
    "the angle between images a and b is @xmath0 40 , i.e. less than 90 .",
    "images a and b have @xmath10 = 0.36 @xmath13 0.65 and @xmath14 without galactic extinction correction , respectively . the larger color error for",
    "a simply reflects the fact that it is 2 magnitudes fainter than b. the difference of @xmath10 between the lensing galaxy and the lens images is larger than the color error itself .",
    "the fact that two objects with different @xmath10 colors from the lensing galaxy are on the same side of the galaxy strongly suggests that they are images of a gravitationally lensed background galaxy .",
    "we observed the brightest object a using the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) of the astrophysical research consortium 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) on 2006 december 17 ( ut ) .",
    "we set the two gratings to cover the wavelength ranges from @xmath15 to @xmath16 and from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , with dispersions of 1.83 @xmath19 per pixel and 2.31 @xmath19 per pixel for the blue and red channels of dis , respectively .",
    "we exposed for 2400 seconds using a 15 slit .",
    "the spectrum given in figure 2 has signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath0 7.5 per pixel around @xmath20 , allowing us to measure the redshift and to identify the characteristics of the object .",
    "the spectrum shows strong balmer absorption lines of redshift z=0.7654 @xmath13 0.0004 , characteristic of post - starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the spectrum does not show any strong emission lines .",
    "e+a galaxies are rare objects , representing @xmath21% of the galaxy population at z@xmath220 @xcite , and lensed e+a galaxies are rarer still ; there is only one previously known lensed e+a galaxy , at z = 1.394 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum has a blue continuum and shows strong absorption by mgii @xmath23 , although the doublet is not resolved in our low - resolution spectrum . as shown in @xcite , the mgii absorption might be a feature of an outflow in this post - starburst galaxy .",
    "because outflows in post - starburst galaxies are thought to originate from galactic winds , the spatial location of this absorption feature in the galaxy would be valuable for understanding the galactic wind scenario .",
    "thanks to the strong lensing of this galaxy , spatially resolved spectroscopy should allow us to map the mgii absorption feature across the galaxy .",
    "we conducted imaging and spectroscopic follow - up observations with the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the subaru 8.2-meter telescope on 2007 january 21 .",
    "the spectroscopic observation was performed with 2x2 on - chip binning with the 300b grism and sy47 filter .",
    "a 1  slit was aligned to observe objects b and c and the lensing galaxy g simultaneously .",
    "an 1800 sec exposure was taken with seeing of @xmath24 .",
    "we also took 120 sec @xmath25- and @xmath26-band images .",
    "all the data were reduced using standard tasks in iraf .",
    "the spectra of the lens images b and c in figure 2 show the same redshift as object a. the redshift of object b , z=0.7659 @xmath13 0.0003 , is determined by the absorption lines h8 ,",
    "h7 , h6 , h , and h@xmath27 . the lines are also used in estimating the redshift of object c , resulting in z=0.7660 @xmath13 0.0007 .",
    "the spectrum of the lensing galaxy g ( figure 2 ) has a redshift of z= 0.3492 @xmath13 0.0007 based on the caii k & h , g - band , and mg lines .",
    "this is in good agreement with the sdss dr5 photometric redshift @xcite , 0.305 @xmath13 0.039 .",
    "an object 132 away , sdss j082728.62 + 223241.0 , has an sdss redshift of z=0.3347 @xmath13 0.0002 .",
    "the lensing galaxy is surrounded by other red galaxies of similar color , suggesting a similar redshift .",
    "the lensing galaxy thus appears to be a member of a galaxy cluster .",
    "the case for this is strengthened by the presence of a x - ray source in the rosat all - sky survey faint source catalog @xcite , 1rxs j082726.8 + 223237 , that is @xmath28  , i.e. a projected distance of @xmath29 kpc , away from the lensing galaxy .",
    "the positional error of this faint source is @xmath30  @xcite , thus this position is consistent with that of the apparent cluster of galaxies . assuming that the x - ray source is at the same redshift as the lensing galaxy , the estimated flux from the rosat catalog is about @xmath31 with the galactic absorption correction , assuming a raymond - smith plasma spectrum @xcite or a simple power - law spectrum of index -0.5 .",
    "it corresponds to a luminosity of about @xmath32 in the range 0.5 - 2.0 kev .",
    "this value is close to the luminosities of typical galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the confirmation of the galaxy cluster is discussed further in  5 .",
    "the subaru @xmath25-band image ( figure 3 ) shows the blue lensed objects more distinctly than sdss , because it is deeper and has better seeing .",
    "we measure the positions of the brightness peaks using sextractor @xcite .",
    "to deblend the faintest lens image c from the lensing galaxy , we used a mexican hat filter with a full - width at half - maximum of 06 .",
    "the derived relative positions of the lens images are used to constrain a lens model in  4 .",
    "we suspect that the faint object d , at 082729.11 + 223253.76 in figure 3 is the fourth lens image . in order to check this hypothesis",
    ", we measure @xmath33 color differences among the lens images .",
    "the color is measured through a 3  diameter aperture . between objects",
    "d and a , @xmath34 is 0.13 @xmath13 0.04 while @xmath35 between d and b is 0.20 @xmath13 0.04 , where the errors are from photon statistics only . given the uncertainties in deblending , this agreement is consistent with the hypothesis that d is the possible fourth lens image .",
    "we fit a model of a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) with external shear to the positions of the four components a , b , c and d system using the _ gravlens _ software @xcite ; this is the simplest model which can fit quadruple lenses in general @xcite . however , the cluster environment of the lens (  5 ) suggest a more complicated model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the perturbation of mass substructures in the lensing environment will affect the lensing magnification ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , we do not use relative flux ratios among the lens images in constraining the lens model , but just use their relative positions .",
    "a well - fitted lens model is found with a positional error of @xmath0 02 between the derived and observed positions of lens images , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the derived central position of the lensing galaxy is within 01 of the optical position .",
    "the required external shear is about 0.1 in this model .",
    "the direction of the critical curve is completely inconsistent with the position angle of the lensing galaxy .",
    "but this discrepancy could be explained by the dominance of the external shear .",
    "the position angle of the quadrupole term is within @xmath36 of the direction to the brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "this angle difference is acceptable when considering the possible offset between the position of the brightest cluster galaxy and the center of mass of the cluster , and the degeneracy between the strength and position angle of the external shear .",
    "the einstein radius ( @xmath37 ) from the fitted model is 223@xmath130.01 , corresponding to 10.8 kpc in the lens plane .",
    ", @xmath38 , and h=0.72 as given in @xcite .",
    "the error of the @xmath37 represents only a fitting error of the mass parameter .",
    "] @xmath37 is the mass parameter of a singular isothermal ellipsoid , that is related to the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy as used in @xcite .",
    "the configuration of the source and lens images is consistent with what we expect from strong lensing in a galaxy cluster environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we present a simple estimation of the properties of the lensing galaxy .",
    "a detailed lensing model and other properties of lensing galaxies will be given as part of a study of a larger sample .",
    "we can estimate a rough total mass of the lensing galaxy inside @xmath37 derived in the previous section : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are angular - diameter distances to the lensed galaxy , to the lensing galaxy , and between the two galaxies , respectively .",
    "the sdss photometric pipeline gives a de vaucouleurs effective radius of the lensing galaxy of 196 @xmath13 0.17 , or 9.5 @xmath13 0.8 kpc in the sdss @xmath43-band .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 is roughly 1.1 effective radii .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy is poorly measured at 210 @xmath13 130 km / s due to the low resolution of the spectrum , r = 500 . with this large uncertainty , it is not meaningful to compare this velocity dispersion with that derived from the sie model .",
    "we next estimate a mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the model magnitude is 21.0 in the @xmath7-band within 1.1 effective radii , after correction for galactic extinction from @xcite .",
    "therefore , the absolute magnitude of the lensing galaxy is @xmath44 in the @xmath3-band , applying the k - corrections given in @xcite .",
    "the estimated @xmath45 of the lensing galaxy is @xmath46 in the @xmath3-band .",
    "we have taken the absolute magnitude of the sun to be 5.45 mag in the @xmath3-band @xcite .",
    "this mass - to - light ratio is higher than that of typical elliptical galaxies , @xmath0 10 @xmath4 @xcite , and is comparable to that of a galaxy group @xcite .",
    "this mass - to - light ratio is acceptable when we remember that the lensing galaxy is near the center of a galaxy cluster as shown in  3.2 , and the lensing is sensitive to all the projected mass .",
    "most massive early - type galaxies reside in dense regions like galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , many lensing ellipticals are known to lie in galaxy group or cluster environments @xcite , partly because of enhancement of the strong lensing probability by external convergence from dark matter in the group / cluster @xcite .",
    "note that the redshift difference between the lensing galaxy and the sdss spectroscopic object sdss j082726.8 + 223241.0 is equivalent to a radial velocity difference of @xmath0 3000 km / s .",
    "this implies either that this galaxy cluster is quite massive , or that there are multiple superposed clusters along the line of sight .",
    "further spectroscopy of galaxies in the field is needed to distinguish these cases .",
    "figure 5 shows the color - magnitude diagram and @xmath47 color distribution of galaxies within 3 , i.e. @xmath0 870 kpc on the lens plane , around the lensing galaxy .",
    "the lensing galaxy appears to be a member of a galaxy cluster , although it is not the brightest member .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the expected @xmath47 color of ellipticals at z @xmath0 0.3 is @xmath0 1.6 .",
    "we select ellipticals with @xmath48-band model magnitude @xmath8 21.5 using the criterion that the de vaucouleurs model fitting likelihood is 10% larger than that of the exponential model .",
    "there is a clear concentration of ellipticals around the expected @xmath49 1.6 .",
    "the brightest member galaxy sdss j082728.42 + 223245.7 is about 10  away from the lensing galaxy . that is , the projected distance is about 48 kpc .",
    "therefore , the lensing might be affected by the dense central part of the galaxy cluster , as we argued above .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to detect strong galaxy - galaxy lenses with photometric catalogs drawn from large multi - band imaging surveys .",
    "thus our method can be applied to the next - generation of wide - field multi - band surveys including ukidss @xcite , pan - starrs @xcite , snap @xcite , lsst @xcite , the sky mapper southern sky survey @xcite , and vista @xcite .    in sdss and future surveys",
    ", our approach can be improved using photometric redshifts as well as color information ; the precision of photometric redshifts is good enough to discriminate low - redshift elliptical galaxies from the high - redshift lensed galaxy .",
    "moreover , photometric - redshift techniques also allow an estimate of the intrinsic colors of galaxies @xcite , allowing red galaxies to be identified in a more sophisticated way than we have .",
    "the photometric pipelines and databases of future multi - band wide - field imaging surveys must have several components in order for our approach to work .",
    "first , the detection of the lens system described in this paper was possible due to the successful deblending algorithm used by the sdss photometric pipeline @xcite .",
    "when the lensing arc is not bright enough to be classified as an extended object , the lens images often look like a series of disconnected , deblended knots , as we saw in figure 1 .",
    "so , we expect our approach to have better efficiency for detecting faint lensed galaxies than do image analysis methods .",
    "the second important consideration is a database which links close neighbors together , given our criteria on the angular distance between possible lensing galaxies and lensed images .    given that our method uses position and color information",
    "only , it can easily be used with archival data in the virtual observatory . in particular , the application of our approach to combined catalogs over a range of wavelengths will benefit from improved photometric redshifts .",
    "for example , the recent discovery of high - redshift galaxy clusters with massive dark matter halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests applying our method to the database of a deep multi - band imaging survey of high - redshift clusters .",
    "we note that our strategy has several disadvantages .",
    "first , our method is restricted by the angular resolution of the data .",
    "the poor angular resolution of sdss , @xmath0 12 , does not permit us to find compact lenses .",
    "future surveys like lsst will be much superior in that regard .",
    "second , our selection criteria are based on our incomplete understanding of the properties of possible lensing galaxies . as we mentioned in  2 , we narrowed the color range of possible lensing galaxies to increase the lensing detection probability .",
    "third , our method will be contaminated by foreground objects mistaken as possible lens images .",
    "improved photometric redshifts should reduce this problem .",
    "we continue to refine our lens candidate selection method .",
    "first of all , our requirement of a color difference of more than two magnitudes between the candidate lensed and lensing galaxies is rather crude , and can be replaced with a criterion based on photometric redshifts .",
    "in addition , we can use other colors like @xmath47 or @xmath50 to separate lenses from galaxy clusters .",
    "in particular , early - type galaxies have a narrow range of @xmath47 color , suggesting that @xmath47 color differences could be better discriminant of background lensed galaxies .",
    "we can also loosen the criterion on the angular separation between the two lens images to find double lens systems , and the criterion on separation between a lensing galaxy and images also can be modified to include large - separation lenses .",
    "we have described a new method to search for strong galaxy - galaxy lenses from the sdss photometric catalog .",
    "we have demonstrated the use of our method with the discovery of a new strong galaxy lens .",
    "a lensing elliptical galaxy at z = 0.349 in a galaxy cluster magnifies a background post - starburst galaxy at z = 0.766 , producing four images .",
    "our selection method will be useful for future imaging surveys , with their superior depth and angular resolution .",
    "it is possible to combine our lensing search method based on a photometric catalog with a direct image analysis method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by using both approaches",
    ", we will be able to detect various classes of lenses , ranging from faint lens images to giant arcs around galaxy clusters .",
    "for example , after selecting a possible lensing system using our method , one can easily apply the image analysis method to the selected object , reducing the time required to apply the direct image analysis approach to a massive imaging dataset .",
    "we are refining our selection criteria and plan follow - up observations of several candidates .",
    "we will publish our full sample and present details of lens models for each object , statistical properties of the lenses , and the detection statistics of our lens sample in future papers . the high magnification that the lensing gives allows us to study the populations of these otherwise faint and distant galaxies in detail .",
    "in particular , for the lensed e+a galaxy we present here , we plan observations using an integral field unit spectrograph and adaptive optics to understand the spatial distribution of the mgii absorption and blue continuum ; given a precise lensing model , we may be able to spatially resolve the outflow across the face of the galaxy .",
