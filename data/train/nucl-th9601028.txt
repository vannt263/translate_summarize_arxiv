    "the properties of vector mesons in the nuclear medium appear to be important not only for the understanding of nuclear dynamics but also possibly to reveal a nonperturbative aspect of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the restoration of chiral symmetry at high baryon density or temperature [ 1 - 3 ] .    as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ,",
    "the qcd vacuum is characterized by a non - zero expectation value , the quark condensate @xmath4 .",
    "when the baryon density or temperature increases , this expectation value decreases and would vanish at the critical density or temperature , if chiral symmetry was not explicitly broken by finite quark masses .",
    "we consider here the decrease of the quark condensate with increasing density . in the low density approximation ,",
    "expected to be valid for densities below the saturation density ( @xmath5 ) , it has been shown that this decrease is linear as a consequence of the feynman - hellmann theorem @xcite . the slope is such that the value of @xmath4 at @xmath5 is about 30% smaller than at @xmath6 . observing this effect experimentally is a major challenge .",
    "brown and rho @xcite suggested that the masses of vector mesons ( @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons ) are generated by their repulsive coupling to the quark condensate and therefore decrease with increasing baryon density . in their approach ,",
    "vector meson masses scale with the cubic root of the quark condensate and have dropped by about 100 mev at @xmath5 .",
    "decreasing in - medium vector meson masses linked to the decrease of the quark condensate were also obtained by making use of the techniques of qcd sum rules in matter @xcite . however",
    ", this result relies on the factorization of the 4-quark condensate , a possibly questionable approximation .",
    "experimental studies of the in - medium vector meson masses are therefore very much needed and could shed some light on the origin of hadron masses and their relation to chiral symmetry .",
    "the observation of the in - medium behaviour of vector mesons requires processes in which vector mesons are produced and decay inside nuclei .",
    "the candidates for such measurements are necessarily broad mesons , as their mean free path has to be shorter that the nuclear size .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath0-meson which has a total width @xmath7 of @xmath8 mev and a propagation length @xmath9 of @xmath10 fm @xcite .",
    "the small free space width @xcite of the @xmath1-meson [ @xmath11 mev and @xmath12 fm ] precludes such studies , unless @xmath1-mesons acquire a large width in matter . it may nevertheless be possible to study the in - medium properties of @xmath1-mesons in the particular recoilless kinematics where they are produced approximately at rest in nuclei @xcite .",
    "we focus on @xmath0-mesons and consider their production in nuclear targets close to threshold , where their formation time and lifetime are not dilatated by large lorentz factors",
    ". the spectrum of the corresponding vector excitation can be best studied through its @xmath13 decay , as the emitted leptons are not distorted by strong interactions .",
    "such experiments are planned at cebaf @xcite and gsi @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to construct a model for the photoproduction of @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons off protons near threshold ( @xmath14 ) as a first step to study later their photoproduction in nuclei in that kinematic regime .",
    "we show that , close to threshold , the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 cross sections @xcite can be well described by a simple meson - exchange model . in this picture ,",
    "the @xmath1 photoproduction appears dominated by @xmath17-exchange while the @xmath0 photoproduction cross section is given mainly by @xmath3-exchange . assuming the vector dominance of the electromagnetic current @xcite , we can extract from this last process a phenomenological @xmath0-nucleon interaction .",
    "we use it to derive the leading contribution to the @xmath0-meson self - energy in matter .",
    "the @xmath0-nucleon interaction in the scalar channel leads to a @xmath0-meson self - energy in matter which is large and attractive .",
    "we discuss the theoretical interpretation of this effect and its consequences for experimental studies of the @xmath0-meson mass in nuclei .",
    "we present our model for the @xmath15 and @xmath18 reactions near threshold in section 2 .",
    "the @xmath0-meson self - energy in matter generated to lowest order by the @xmath0-nucleon interaction deduced from this model with the @xmath19 coupling we consider is calculated and discussed in section 3 .",
    "we conclude by a few remarks in section 4 .",
    "the production of the @xmath0(770)- and @xmath1(782)-mesons induced by photons of a few gev scattered from proton targets has been studied extensively @xcite . at sufficiently high energy ,",
    "typically @xmath20 , this process appears diffractive : the total cross section is roughly energy independent , the differential cross section @xmath21 exhibits a sharp peak in the forward direction , the t - channel exchange has the quantum numbers of the vacuum ( pomeron exchange ) and the amplitude is mostly imaginary .    at lower energies @xmath22 ,",
    "meson - exchange contributions are expected to play a role .",
    "the importance of the @xmath17-exchange in the @xmath15 reaction near threshold was emphasized long ago and is supported by data taken with linearly polarized photons @xcite .    following the early suggestion of berman and drell @xcite and work by joos and kramer @xcite",
    ", we describe the @xmath23 reaction near threshold by t - channel exchanges and assume that the production amplitudes are dominated by the exchange of light mesons .",
    "there is no rigorous justification for this choice .",
    "we favour this model because it provides a reasonable description of the data with a small number of parameters .",
    "it is in particular much simpler than the s - channel picture , based on compton - like graphs , which requires summation over a very large number of overlapping baryon resonances @xcite .    for reasons which will become clear later",
    ", we begin our discussion by the @xmath15 reaction . in the born approximation",
    ", only scalar- and pseudoscalar - meson exchanges can contribute to our t - channel description .",
    "vector - meson exchanges are not allowed by charge conjugation invariance . in the pseudoscalar channel ,",
    "the @xmath24-exchange contribution is small compared to the @xmath17-exchange for two reasons .",
    "first , the total @xmath15 cross section is dominated by the low @xmath25 regime , where the @xmath24-exchange is strongly suppressed compared to the @xmath17-exchange because of their large mass difference .",
    "second , the @xmath26 branching ratio is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath27 branching ratio @xcite .",
    "an explicit calculation shows that the ratio of the coupling constants @xmath28 is of the order of 15 .",
    "this implies a further suppression of the @xmath24-exchange compared to the @xmath17-exchange .",
    "consequently , we are left effectively with two contributions , the @xmath29-exchange and the @xmath3-exchange shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the relative importance of these two contributions may be assessed by studying the radiative transitions of @xmath1-mesons to neutral pions and @xmath3 s .",
    "since the @xmath3-meson is an effective degree of freedom associated with the propagation of two pions in a relative s - wave state , a first estimate of the strength of these transitions can be obtained from the branching ratio of the @xmath1-meson into the @xmath30 and @xmath31 channels ( in the latter case , the coupling of the two pions in a @xmath32-like state is forbidden by charge conjugation invariance ) .",
    "the @xmath33 branching ratio is known to be of the order of 8.5 % @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the only data available on the @xmath34 branching ratio is an upper limit of 3.6 x 10@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this suggests nevertheless that the @xmath17-exchange is the dominant contribution .",
    "another approach to evaluate these vertices is vector meson dominance @xcite .",
    "because of isospin conservation , the @xmath36 channel will couple only to the isovector part of the electromagnetic current while the @xmath37 channel will couple solely to its isoscalar part . using the current - field identities of kroll , lee and zumino @xcite",
    ", we identify the isoscalar and isovector parts of the electromagnetic current with the @xmath1- and @xmath0-meson currents respectively .",
    "this is shown pictorially in fig .",
    "the relation between the electromagnetic current and the vector fields is given by @xcite @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the @xmath0 and @xmath1-masses and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are dimensionless constants , which can be determined from the @xmath13 partial decay widths of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons @xcite to be @xmath44 and @xmath45 because the @xmath29- and @xmath3-mesons have opposite parity , the @xmath17- and @xmath3-exchange amplitudes do not interfere . consequently , the ratio of the @xmath17- to @xmath3-exchange contributions to the total @xmath15 cross section is proportional to @xmath46 , indicating again the dominance of the @xmath17-exchange term .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental observation that the exchange of unnatural parity states in the t - channel dominates the @xmath15 cross section near threshold @xcite .",
    "we calculate first the @xmath17-exchange contribution to this reaction .",
    "the @xmath17nn vertex is described by the pseudoscalar coupling @xmath47 with a dipole form factor , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the pion mass , @xmath50 the pion - nucleon coupling constant ( we take @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 the cut - off characterizing the pion - nucleon vertex .",
    "lorentz and gauge invariances imply that the @xmath53 vertex is of the form , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita tensor and the dimensional coupling strength has been normalized to the @xmath1-meson mass .",
    "we use the experimental partial decay width for @xmath33 @xcite to determine the coupling constant @xmath56 = 3.315 .",
    "using the current - field identity ( 1 ) , we can calculate the @xmath57 vertex assuming @xmath0-dominance ( as shown in the left graph of fig .",
    "2 ) and express the @xmath58 vertex as a function of the @xmath59 interaction .",
    "writing by analogy to ( 7 ) @xmath60 we obtain @xmath61 we fix the non - locality of this vertex from the study of the @xmath62 form factor analyzed with the interaction lagrangian ( 8) and the current - field identity ( 1 ) .",
    "this model of the vertex is shown in fig . 3 and in fig .",
    "4 we display the result of the calculated form factor , with a local @xmath63 vertex ( dashed curve ) and with an extended vertex of the form @xmath64 with @xmath65 ( full curve ) .",
    "it is clear that a simple vector dominance model with a local @xmath63 vertex does not describe the data @xcite and that an additional form factor is required .",
    "we shall not discuss here the theoretical understanding of this vertex @xcite , which is closely related to the non - abelian anomaly @xcite .",
    "we assume that the mass scale of the @xmath63 form factor obtained by studying the dalitz decay of the @xmath1-meson characterizes the size of the @xmath63 vertex .",
    "consequently , we employ the same value of the cut - off to describe the dependence of the form factor on the pion four - momentum when the @xmath0-meson is on - shell and the pion is off - shell .    in this way , all the parameters of our @xmath17-exchange model of the @xmath15 cross section are fixed , except for @xmath52 , the cut - off mass in the @xmath17nn form factor .",
    "we determine @xmath66 from a fit to the total @xmath15 cross section near threshold @xmath67 = 1.108 gev ) , knowing from data that the domain of validity of this pion - exchange model should not extend beyond @xmath68 2 gev , as natural parity exchanges ( pomerons ) are expected to be responsible for a large fraction of the cross section at @xmath69 = 2.8 gev @xcite .",
    "we find that the best fit is obtained for @xmath52 = 0.7 gev .",
    "the total cross section for the @xmath15 reaction obtained in our model is compared to data @xcite in fig .",
    "the @xmath17-exchange model accounts for the data below 2 gev , while for larger photon energies , an additional contribution is needed .",
    "the missing cross section is almost independent of energy , a behaviour consistent with the pomeron - exchange term becoming dominant .",
    "the value of @xmath52 = 0.7 gev is consistent with analyses of pion - nucleon data @xcite and with recent work indicating that the larger @xmath52 obtained in models of the nucleon - nucleon interaction can be reduced if the correlated @xmath70-exchange is explicitly included @xcite .    to have a more stringent test of the form factors , we have calculated with the @xmath17-exchange model discussed above the differential cross section @xmath21 for the @xmath15 reaction induced by photons of energies 1.4 @xmath711.8 gev .",

    "is well reproduced for @xmath73 . beyond this value , which corresponds to the range of our cut - offs",

    "we conclude from this discussion that , sufficiently close to threshold @xmath74 gev ) , there is no clear indication of anything else contributing to the @xmath15 process in the t - channel but the @xmath17-exchange .",
    "it is also remarkable that for values of the coupling constants and the cut - offs consistent with other processes , the total cross section is correctly given by this simple model .    motivated by this result , we study the @xmath16 reaction within the same approach . as in the case of @xmath1 photoproduction ,",
    "vector - meson exchanges are not allowed and we consider only the @xmath29- and @xmath3-exchanges shown in fig .",
    "only the isoscalar part of the electromagnetic current ( @xmath1 field ) contributes to the @xmath17-exchange graph , while the @xmath3-exchange selects the isovector part ( @xmath32 field ) .",
    "in contrast to what happens in the @xmath1 photoproduction , the scalar - exchange appears to be the dominant contribution to the @xmath75 reaction .",
    "we see two reasons for this .",
    "information on the scalar and pseudoscalar coupling strengths can be inferred from an analysis of the @xmath32 radiative decays . in spite of unfavourable phase space ,",
    "the @xmath76 branching ratio of ( 9.9 @xmath77 1.6 ) x 10@xmath35 is an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath78 branching ratio of ( 7.9 @xmath77 2.0 ) x 10@xmath79 @xcite ( again the @xmath32-like coupling of the @xmath80 pair in the @xmath81 decay is forbidden by charge conjugation invariance ) . using the current - field identities ( 1)-(2 ) ,",
    "it is also clear from fig . 7",
    "that the @xmath46 ratio of @xmath6810 is now in favour of the @xmath3-exchange contribution to the cross section .",
    "we keep both @xmath17- and @xmath3-exchanges in the calculation of the @xmath16 cross section .",
    "the @xmath17-exchange contribution is evaluated with the same parameters as those used for the description of the @xmath15 cross section .",
    "the @xmath3-exchange involves two vertices .",

    "we should remark that we use a zero - width description of the produced @xmath0-meson .",
    "this is in general a good approximation for the quantities we calculate , in particular since we do not consider cross sections in a specific @xmath0 decay channel .",
    "however , in the zero - width approximation , we can not reproduce the lowest energy point @xmath106 = 1.05 gev ) , which is below `` threshold '' .    as shown in fig .",
    "9 , the @xmath17-exchange contributes very modestly to the cross section , at any momentum transfer .",
    "the differential cross section provides definite constraints on the cut - offs and couplings for the @xmath3-exchange . in the total cross section",
    ", there is a trade - off between the form factors and the @xmath90 coupling strength .",
    "however , increasing the cut - off masses to compensate for a smaller value of @xmath107 would produce a differential cross section which is too flat .",
    "the @xmath88 vertex ( 13 ) , suggested by current - field identities , is not unique .",
    "lorentz invariance allows also for a nonderivative coupling of the form ,    @xmath108    this vertex used in the calculation of the photoproduction cross section leads however to a result which is not gauge invariant .",
    "hence , we do not consider it in this work .",
    "the phenomenological t - matrix for the @xmath0-nucleon interaction , obtained in the born approximation , fits the available data on the @xmath16 reaction near threshold . in the following section we employ this interaction to derive the @xmath0-meson self - energy in the nuclear medium",
    "to leading order , the @xmath0-meson self - energy in nuclear matter is given by the tadpole diagram shown in fig .",
    "this is , in the born approximation , nothing but the low - density theorem discussed in ref .",
    "we calculate this term with @xmath109 coupling given by eqs .",

    "we find @xmath111 where q is the @xmath0-meson 4-momentum and @xmath0 is the matter density . using the parameters obtained in the previous section , we get @xmath112 we have assumed that the a priori unknown phase of the @xmath94 coupling constant is such that the corresponding self - energy is attractive .",
    "this follows naturally if we think of the @xmath3-exchange as an effective @xmath113-exchange process where the intermediate states are dominated by states of energies higher then the @xmath0 mass .",
    "an example of such a process with an intermediate @xmath1 particle - hole state is shown in fig .",

    "equation ( 19 ) can indeed be written as    @xmath118    with    @xmath119    at @xmath120 , the pole is shifted down from @xmath40 to 0.82 @xmath40 and the strength is reduced by 32 % .",
    "this result may at first sight seem dubious , since the total strength satisfies a sum rule    @xmath121 = 1.\\label{sumrule}\\ ] ]    this can be understood by considering the underlying picture where the @xmath3-exchange effectively accounts for a @xmath122-exchange process ( see fig .",
    "the associated @xmath0-meson self - energy ( fig .",
    "11b ) is energy - dependent and has an imaginary part . in the case illustrated in fig .",
    "11b , it corresponds to the decay of a @xmath0-meson ( off - shell ) into an @xmath1-meson and a particle - hole pair .",
    "this physical process also shows up in the analytical structure of the @xmath0 propagator as a cut in the complex @xmath25 plane . by replacing the @xmath123-exchange effectively by a @xmath3-exchange ,",
    "one implicitly assumes that this cut is far away from the energies of interest , so that the energy dependence due to the intermediate states can be neglected . for the problem at hand ,",
    "this assumption is not rigorously justified . in what follows",
    ", we shall however assume that the dominant contributions to the intermediate states have masses larger than the @xmath0-meson mass .    to see how this picture affects the sum rule ,",
    "let us consider the following schematic model .",
    "replace the cut in the self - energy by a simple pole located at @xmath124 .",
    "the @xmath0-meson self - energy is then of the form    @xmath125    we assume derivative coupling so that the self - energy is proportional to @xmath25",
    ". thus , the self - energy ( 23 ) reduces to the @xmath3-induced self - energy ( 16 ) in the limit @xmath126 .",
    "the propagator    @xmath127    has two poles , a low mass one @xmath128 near @xmath129 , and a high mass one @xmath130 near @xmath131 .",
    "the low mass pole is identified with the in - medium @xmath0-meson . for @xmath132 ,",
    "one finds , to leading order in @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the corresponding residues are @xmath136 and @xmath137 and the sum rule is fulfilled , i.e. , @xmath138 . in the limit @xmath139 , @xmath140 but @xmath141 remains finite .",
    "the missing strength is moved out to @xmath142 .",
    "consequently , the propagator ( 20 ) does not satisfy the sum rule because it is valid only at low energies , while the sum rule involves all energies .",
    "thus , our choice of phases for the coupling constants , which leads to a reduced @xmath0-mass in medium , is consistent also with the sum rule ( 22 ) .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the presently available data on the photoproduction of @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons off protons near threshold ( e@xmath143 2 gev ) can be well described by a simple one - boson - exchange model .",
    "the dominant processes are the pseudoscalar @xmath17-exchange for the @xmath1 photoproduction and the scalar exchange , which we parametrize by an effective @xmath3-meson , for the @xmath32 photoproduction .    the @xmath17-exchange model of the @xmath15",
    "is constructed using parameters constrained by other data with moderate extrapolations .",

    "these data @xcite have large error bars and have been obtained with very few events .",
    "a better measurement of this form factor appears very important for the understanding of the @xmath146 vertex , in which @xmath147 is a virtual time - like photon .",
    "it is interesting that both our @xmath17-exchange model and polarization data @xcite on the @xmath15 reaction close to threshold do not seem to require a scalar exchange .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath37 interaction is substantially weaker than the @xmath117 interaction .",
    "the @xmath104-exchange model of the @xmath16 reaction is much less constrained and it is clear that it does not provide a detailed understanding of the photoproduction of @xmath0-mesons near threshold .",
    "it is indeed desirable to build a dynamical model of the effective @xmath3-exchange , going beyond the born approximation , to unravel the physics of this process .",
    "this will make it possible to determine the important contributions to the intermediate states of the type shown in fig .",
    "11b and put our discussion of section 3 on a firmer basis .",
    "such a dynamical model would also allow a consistent discussion of the @xmath117 and @xmath37 vertices .",
    "it could provide a more detailed comparison to data through a study of the energy - dependence of the ratio of the real to the imaginary parts of the production amplitude , a quantity expected to be very sensitive to the underlying dynamics .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "we also reemphasize the need for much more accurate data than those presently available @xcite .",
    "our discussion of the @xmath0-meson self - energy in matter shows the importance of the structure of the @xmath148 vertex .",
    "the off - shell behaviour plays a very important role in determining this self - energy from the @xmath32 photoproduction reaction .",
    "additional constraints on the @xmath148 vertex from different kinematic regimes ( available for example in the electroproduction of vector mesons near threshold ) would be very important to establish our result on a more solid basis .",
    "systematic studies of processes involving vector mesons in a consistent theoretical framework , such as nonlinear chiral lagrangians in which vector mesons are introduced as dynamical gauge bosons @xcite , could also provide useful guidance for choosing the form of the interaction vertices .",
    "the particular form of the @xmath0-meson self - energy will affect the dilepton spectrum of @xmath0-like excitations in nuclei .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of this spectrum is therefore closely linked to the understanding of the momentum dependence of the @xmath0 self - energy at finite baryon density .",
