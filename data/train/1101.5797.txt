    "the standard model ( sm ) seeks to describe nature as a realization of the gauge group @xmath2 . while there exists substantial experimental evidence to suggest that this is indeed correct , at least up to the scale of a few hundred gevs , the picture is far from complete .",
    "several extensions of the sm have been suggested  @xcite and continue to be suggested in the attempt to redress the ` unsatisfactory ' aspects of the model .",
    "one common feature among many of these models is the existence of massive particles that couple to a pair of sm fermions and are likely to appear as a resonance in the process @xmath3 .",
    "experimental searches for such particles are most often carried out in the dijet channel or in the drell - yan process . however , as one wishes to study a fermion - antifermion final state , the @xmath4 channel is also an option that could be investigated . if the new particles under consideration have only strong interactions , then the drell - yan process would not be sensitive to their presence . as for the dijet process , while it may receive contributions from new strongly interacting particles , sensitivity would be limited by the fact that final states consisting of a quark - antiquark pair not be distinguishable from those with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 . on the other hand , @xmath10-jets can be identified with reasonable accuracy using flavor - tagging techniques . thus , @xmath4 production may prove to be useful as a search channel .    in this paper , the reach of the @xmath4 channel in the search for some classes of new physics(np ) models , namely , the chiral color model ( with and without flavor universality ) and the flavor universal coloron model , is examined .",
    "this channel is of particular importance for the flavor non - universal chiral color model .",
    "the observation of forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath1 production(@xmath11 ) caused a slew of models to be proposed as plausible explanations . in a majority of these ,",
    "new couplings were introduced for the top quark while keeping bottom quark couplings unchanged .",
    "the nu - axigluon is an exception to this and a search in the @xmath4 channel can provide one way to distinguish this model amongst a host of others .",
    "the next section contains a brief description of the models and the existing limits on their constituents .",
    "the details of the calculation are discussed in sections  [ sec : analytic ] and [ sec : numeric ] .",
    "in the standard model , the gauge group @xmath12 is broken to @xmath13 . this has prompted attempts to examine whether qcd may be the remnant of a broken symmetry too .",
    "the unifiable chiral color model and the flavor universal coloron model are two models which propose that @xmath14 is actually a relic of a @xmath15 symmetry broken spontaneously at a high scale .",
    "chiral color models  @xcite assume the gauge group describing strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions to be @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is sought to be broken spontaneously at a scale comparable to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "@xmath18 remains and is identified with @xmath14 .",
    "thus , in these models , there exists an octet of massive colored gauge bosons ( axigluons ) alongside an octet of massless ones ( gluons ) .",
    "the axigluons(@xmath19 ) have an axial vector coupling to quarks which has the _ same _ strength ( @xmath20 ) as the gluon - quark coupling .",
    "these models also require the existence of additional fermions and colored scalars .",
    "infact , in the most optimistic scenario  @xcite , five generations of quarks and leptons , three higgs doublets and additional electrically neutral as well as charged fermion multiplets in ` non - standard ' representations are predicted .",
    "this gives rise to a model that , besides replicating many of the successes of the standard model , is rich in high scale physics and is unifiable at a scale much lower than that for the latter .",
    "initially the scale of chiral - color breaking was assumed to be the same as that of electroweak symmetry breaking and axigluons were expected to have mass @xmath21 250 gev .",
    "early experimental bounds obtained from measurements of @xmath22 decays and hadronic cross - sections in @xmath23 collisions  @xcite ruled out @xmath24 50 gev .",
    "the region 50 gev @xmath25 120 gev was ruled out by considering effects on hadronic decays of @xmath26 and the possibility of associated production of axigluons  @xcite .",
    "dijet production in hadronic colliders has been repeatedly surveyed for signals of a resonant axigluon  @xcite .",
    "a series of searches at the tevatron in this channel  @xcite have now resulted in exclusion of @xmath24 1250 gev at 95% confidence  @xcite .",
    "the use of forward - backward asymmetry as a signal for axigluons has also been studied  @xcite and possible limits from top production data have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "more recently , flavor non - universal versions of the original chiral color model have been proposed  @xcite as possible explanations of the forward - backward asymmetry observed in @xmath1 production at the tevatron  @xcite . in particular , the model in ref .",
    "@xcite contains four quark generations and is based on the gauge group @xmath27 .",
    "the gluon and the flavor non - universal axigluon(@xmath28 ) are admixtures of the gauge bosons corresponding to @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the mixing angle .",
    "the coupling of the non - universal axigluon   consists of a vector and an axial - vector part .",
    "while the vector coupling is generation universal ( @xmath32 ) , the axial - vector coupling is not , with @xmath33 for the first two generations and @xmath34 for the other two . demanding that the couplings be perturbative , restricts 10@xmath35 45 .",
    "although , the lorentz structure of the couplings is the similar to that in the original chiral color model , the non - universal nature of the couplings implies that the mass limits on the former from the dijet search , are not directly applicable .",
    "however , as the main motivation behind the proposition was to explain the observed @xmath11 , the parameter space can be constrained using measurements in the top sector , such as the @xmath1 cross - section , @xmath11 and the @xmath36 spectrum  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the apparent agreement of the invariant mass distribution ( which is reported for @xmath36 upto 1400 gev ) with the sm , can be used immediately , albeit somewhat naively , to put a lower limit of 1400 gev on @xmath37 .    in the flavor universal coloron model  @xcite ,",
    "the high scale color gauge group is .",
    "this is broken to @xmath14 at the tev scale . here",
    "again , there is an octet of massive colored gauge bosons ( colorons ) in addition to gluons .",
    "the original model  @xcite was aimed at constructing a dynamical mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking involving a @xmath38 condensate . in this model ,",
    "the third generation quarks belonged to a different representation of @xmath39 as compared to the other quark families .",
    "however , in the flavor universal version of the model , all quarks transform as @xmath40 under the extended color gauge group .",
    "the couplings are proportional to @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively with @xmath45 .",
    "the coupling of the coloron(@xmath46 ) to quarks is then proportional to @xmath47 , where , @xmath48 is the mixing angle and @xmath49 = @xmath50 .",
    "an additional scalar multiplet , transforming as @xmath51 , effects the symmetry breaking .",
    "initially , this model was proposed in order to explain excess seen in the inclusive jet cross - section in the high @xmath52 region by the cdf experiment at the tevatron  @xcite . with increase in statistics and improvement in both theoretical calculations and exprimental techniques ,",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment has improved considerably  @xcite .",
    "however , the model itself continues to be of interest as it can accomodate , within its framework , a theory with composite quarks  @xcite .",
    "further , as in the case of the original topcolor proposal  @xcite , the flavor universal version too can provide a scheme for dynamical ewsb via formation of a @xmath38 condensate  @xcite .",
    "the original proponents of the model  @xcite , placed the limit @xmath53 450 gev required to keep corrections to the electroweak @xmath54 parameter within allowed limits  @xcite .",
    "in addition , demanding that the model remain in its higgs phase at low energies , results in an upper limit @xmath21 4 on the value of @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of colorons was studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite wherein dijet data from the tevatron  @xcite was used to place a lower limit of 870 gev and 1 tev on @xmath55 for @xmath49 values of 1 and 2 respectively , and the lower limit on @xmath56 was raised to 837 gev .",
    "sensitivity to this variety of new physics is also expected in the top sector and this has been explored in refs .",
    "the latest measurement of dijet mass spectrum at the cdf experiment at the tevatron , however , rules out the existence of flavor - universal colorons with mass below 1250 gev  @xcite .      as mentioned earlier , in the search for axigluons and colorons ,",
    "the dijet channel has been studied extensively and has been the focus of most experimental searches .",
    "rates have been calculated for on - shell production of axigluons / colorons followed by decay and this has been used for comparison with data .",
    "some searches have also been carried out in the @xmath57 channel  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a ( nu-)axigluon / coloron resonance , if present , will also affect @xmath0 production rates .",
    "while both the cdf and d0 experiments have vast b - physics programmes , they are mostly concerned with studying properties of b - mesons  @xcite .",
    "the potential of the @xmath0 channel in searches for heavy resonances remains largely untapped .    in the case of the models described above , @xmath7 and @xmath9 dijet final states are not sensitive to the new particles and create a background .",
    "on the other hand , t - channel processes such as @xmath58 , while getting contributions from new physics , tend to render difficult , the task of identification of a resonance structure in the dijet invariant mass spectrum .",
    "this is specially true when @xmath59 1 tev and the resonance is a broad one to begin with   1 tev , the natural width itself is large . ] . on the other hand contribution to @xmath4 production from the @xmath60-channel",
    "is negligible .",
    "this , coupled with advancements in @xmath10-tagging algorithms may be exploited in strengthening the search for and colorons as well as other new particles with similar interactions .",
    "at a hadron collider , @xmath0 production gets contributions from the processes @xmath61 and @xmath62 . at the centre - of - mass energies associated with currently operational colliders , namely , the tevatron and the lhc , production is dominated by the gluon initated process . however , in the high invariant mass region ( in which we are interested ) , it is the quark initiated process which dominates .",
    "the presence of ( nu-)axigluons or colorons modifies the amplitude for the quark initiated process .",
    "the @xmath10 density in protons and anti - protons is negligible and hence the major contribution accrues from the s - channel process @xmath63 , mediated by a ( nu-)axigluon or a coloron in addition to a gluon and hence small . ] .",
    "this makes for a distinct , albeit broad , peak in the @xmath0 invariant mass ( @xmath64 ) spectrum .",
    "the analytic expressions for the differential cross - section are analogous to those for @xmath65 production  @xcite with @xmath66 .",
    "the width for the new gauge bosons is about 10% of the mass .",
    "thus , for @xmath67 a few hundred gevs , the large width implies that the narrow - width approximation is no longer valid and the off - shell contribution must also be taken into account . for axigluons and nu - axigluons",
    ", there are terms proportional to odd powers of @xmath68 which give rise to a forward - backward asymmetry in the angular distribution . in contrast",
    ", @xmath68 dependence for the coloron case is identical to that in the pure sm and is forward - backward symmetric .",
    "the interference between the coloron and gluon mediated amplitudes is negative in the region @xmath69 and causes the @xmath64 spectrum to dip before peaking .",
    "the gluon initiated process remains unaffected by the presence of ( nu-)axigluons / colorons and forms the chief sm background .",
    "the corresponding analytic expression is available in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", the @xmath60-channel and @xmath70-channel contributions get enhanced in the region where @xmath711 , i.e. in the low @xmath72 region . moreover",
    ", the low threshold for @xmath0 production implies that it is easily attained with low values of bjorken @xmath73 , for which , gluon densities are larger than quark densities .",
    "hence , the dominant contribution , particularly in the low @xmath72 and low @xmath74 region , arises from this process .",
    "in this study , the contribution of ( nu-)axigluons and colorons to @xmath0 production is calculated at the parton level . cteq6l",
    "parton distribution functions  @xcite are used .",
    "the factorization scale is chosen to be @xmath52 .",

    ", there is a an enhanced contribution to the sm @xmath62 process from the low @xmath72 and @xmath74 regions . to reduce this background , appropriate cuts need to be imposed on @xmath72",
    "further , the identification of a @xmath4 final state requires a double b - tag .",
