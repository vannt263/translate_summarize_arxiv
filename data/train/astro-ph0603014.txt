    "energetic outflows from young stellar objects exert a strong effect on their parent molecular clouds .",
    "consideration of the combined energy budget for many outflows in dense star forming regions compared with the energy of the parent molecular cloud s turbulent motions support notions of feedback by showing an approximate balance between outflow energy input and turbulent support @xcite .",
    "outflow momentum must be subsumed and isotropized into the cloud if young stellar object outflows are to drive turbulence in molecular clouds .",
    "the explicit mechanisms by which this occurs has yet to be demonstrated .",
    "@xcite have recently explored the relation between turbulent cloud motions and observed outflow activity in ngc 1333 .",
    "their results showed that the location of active outflows did not affect the degree of turbulence in the cloud .",
    "in addition recent numerical studies @xcite have shown that direct collisions of active outflows are not effective at transferring jet / outflow momentum to cloud material ( by active we mean that the momentum flux of the outflow remains roughly constant through out the interaction ) . while active outflows did not seem to energize turbulent motions @xcite were able to identify many sub - parsec size slowly expanding cavities in 13co observations of ngc 1333 which they identified as dense wind - swept shells of gas that expand into the cloud after the driving source of the outflow has expired .",
    "they found that the mechanical energy required to open these cavities represents a significant fraction of that required to drive the cloud turbulence .",
    "the authors argued that these cavities were relics of previously active molecular outflows .",
    "because cavities have a longer lifetime than those opened by active and younger outflows , they would be more numerous than higher velocity , younger outflows .",
    "these cavities could provide the coupling between outflows and turbulence in molecular clouds .",
    "thus one means of re - energizing turbulence in clouds may be through these `` fossil outflow '' cavities which are disrupted after they have slowed to speeds comparable to the turbulent velocity of the ambient cloud .",
    "our simulations focus on outflows whose energy and momentum flux decreases with time . such behavior is expected from observations which show an exponential decrease in outflow momentum flux with age of central source @xcite .",
    "we note that most simulations of molecular outflows have focused on continuous momentum injection models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as an object ages",
    ", the bowshock driven by a previously active outflow continues to expand into the molecular cloud evolving into what @xcite refer to this as a `` fossil cavity '' .",
    "theoretical models for expanding spherical cavities _",
    "i.e. _ wind blown bubbles , have been applied to cavities opened by outflows in a few cases .",
    "@xcite applied their wind blown bubble model to the hh 7 - 11 region , located in the ngc 1333 cloud . in the context of a slow wind",
    ", @xcite suggested that cavities opened in molecular clouds by outflows were consistent with their estimated mechanical luminosities .",
    "the observational properties of molecular outflows driven by jets and winds have been modeled by many authors .",
    "but , as noted above , the emphasis has most often been on active outflows .",
    "for example , @xcite recently modeled the limb - brightened cavity associated with hh 46/47 @xcite as a bow shock driven by a perfectly collimated active jet .",
    "kinematic patterns of the swept - up material is often of particular interest in these studies as these are readily observable and can distinguish between models outflow formation .",
    "linear increases of velocity with distance , so - called hubble law patterns , have been identified in some but not all theoretical studies .",
    "the bow shock model of @xcite and the numerical simulations of @xcite in which outflows are created by the entrainment of ambient gas by a single bow shock all reproduce the hubble velocity law . in these models ,",
    "the hubble velocity law is partly due to the geometry of the bow shock .",
    "an explanation is that the highest forward velocities are found in the apex of the bow shock , which is also the point farther away from the source .",
    "the forward velocities decrease toward the wings of the bow shock , and the farthest away from the apex ( or closer to the outflow source ) , the slower will be the entrained gas ( see figure 3 of @xcite , figure 12 of @xcite & figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "in other models , however , hubble laws do not appear as a consequence of either analytical or numerical simulations . in the studies of @xcite jets",
    "produce a characteristic `` spur '' pattern in the swept - up gas .",
    "it seems that some combination of entrainment or unstable boundaries may be needed to create hubble laws in active outflows .    in this paper",
    "we carry out a numerical exploration of cavities that are opened in molecular clouds by both jets and wide angle winds ( waw ) .",
    "we compare the morphology and velocity structure of cavities caused by continuously injected momentum with those of extinct outflows .",
    "our first goal is to recover observable properties of cavities .",
    "this is the first step in verifying the conjecture that fossil cavities represent the means of transferring outflow energy and momentum into cloud turbulence . by confirming that we can recover the morphology and kinematics of observed fossil shells",
    "we can then , in future works , explore cavity - cavity collisions and the energizing of turbulent motions .",

    "the continuously driven outflows are shown at times of comparable spatial extent to their fossil counterparts ( @xmath49 ) but are considerably younger at @xmath50 the age .",

    "has left an evacuated cavity with a large ( @xmath67 ) density contrast in the region previously occupied by the driving wind . at this time the dense shell of wind swept gas just behind bow shock has begun backfilling into the cavity at @xmath68 .",

    "consideration of a spherically symmetric impulse carrying total momentum @xmath76 imparted into a thin shell of wind swept gas that propagates into a uniform environment of density @xmath25 leads to a momentum conserving self - similar model for the the observed outflow cavity .",
    "the volume , @xmath77 , swept by the shell is given as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the velocity of the expanding shell .",
    "momentum conservation yields @xmath80 where @xmath81is the mass entrained into the wind swept shell . substituting for the mass swept into the shell we have @xmath82",
    "this scaling relation provides a simple model for momentum - driven , self - similar , spherical flows . @xcite",
    "employ this scaling relation to infer that the ensemble of fossil outflow cavities they observed in ngc 1333 contain enough momentum to maintain turbulence in the cloud .",
    "this relation applies only to extinct outflows with @xmath83 , due to the explicit assumption of an impulsive driving wind built into the scaling relation .",
    "while protostars do not eject outflow momentum instantaneously , this is a reasonable approximation for long - extinct outflows .",
    "we emphasize that due to the strong radiative energy loss characteristic of yso environments , thermal pressure plays a minor role in driving their dynamics .",
    "therefore such flows satisfy the momentum - driven constraint .",
    "however , yso outflows , in general , are not spherical and the backfill of the fossil cavity can not be described by such a self - similar motion .",
    "we therefore express the volume @xmath84 subtended by the bow shock of a yso outflow cavity more generally as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an arbitrary function of time that accounts for the deviation of the actual cavity size from that predicted by the approximate scaling relation .",
    "we extract @xmath86 from the simulations by measuring the volume enclosed by the bow shock delineating the fossil cavity at 100 equally spaced intervals in time through out the simulation .",
    "the ambient density and net momentum injection used in the fossil cavity models presented here yield @xmath87 for the jet model and @xmath88 for the waw model .",
    "we have taken @xmath76 as the net momentum imparted to the cavity throughout the simulation independent of time .",
    "therefore @xmath86 is the factor by which the impulsive , momentum - driven scaling relation misinterprets the cavity size - age relationship of the simulated fossil cavities .",
    "figure [ f7 ] shows @xmath89 for the jet driven ( left ) and waw driven ( right ) cases .",
    "the solid vertical line in the plots is at @xmath90 for the jet and wide angle wind cases respectively and the dotted vertical line in the plots at @xmath91 denotes the time where the radial edge of the fossil cavities have decelerated to @xmath92 .",
    "first we note that @xmath93 throughout most of the cavity lifetime .",
    "the faster than predicted cavity expansion is likely due to a combination of factors not accounted for in the simple scaling law .",
    "first is the effect of the geometry of the flow .",
    "the scaling law is essentially a 1d approximation while the simulations show complex 2d motions both at the head of the jet and , in the case of the wide angle wind , along the walls of the cavity where wind material is redirected by an oblique shock .",
    "the collapse of the interior walls into the cavity also changes the global dynamics .",
    "this effect violates the assumption that a thin , wind swept shell of gas will delineate the cavity perimeter .",
    "the ambient gas overrun by the cavity will not , in general , be accelerated to travel with the outer outflow shell , particularly in the case of a jet - driven cavity .",
    "some of the gas entrained into a cavity may be accelerated to a speed that is only some fraction of that of the cavity walls . the scaling law therefore under estimates cavity volume .",
    "the most significant observational consequence is that this model may underestimate the net momentum of observed cavities inferred from their volume . in spite of these effects the scaling law retains reasonable predictive capacity for interpreting decelerating cavities .",
    "because the geometry of the driving wind of an observed cavity is often unknown , the scaling relation provides a reasonable rough approximation for interpreting observational data , particularly when the exact geometry of the cavity is obfuscated .",
    "figures [ f5 ] & [ f6 ] show that the expansion of the radial edges of the simulated cavities decelerated to considerably less than the turbulent speed typical of star forming environments of a few @xmath94 @xcite by @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , the cavities can continue to expand for no more than a few more turbulent crossing times . by the time several turbulent crossing times have elapsed ,",
    "the cavity will have entrained enough of the turbulent ambient gas to be subsumed into and become indistinguishable form the turbulent motions of the cloud .",
    "its momentum will act to feed the turbulence that will ultimately destroy it .",
    "@xcite reach the same conclusion for cavities observed in ngc 1333 using the scaling relation that is in rough agreement with our simulation models .",
    "this picture of outflow driven turbulence is also supported by recent 3d numerical mhd simulations of @xcite .",
    "they model protostellar outflow ejection from dense condensations that form the evolution of an initially jeans - unstable , rotating , magnetized cloud .",
    "the initially seeded `` interstellar turbulence '' decays rapidly , allowing the formation of gravitationally bound condensations .",
    "they find that `` protostellar turbulence '' replenishes turbulent motion and inhibits further collapse in the cloud by imposing that 10% of each core mass is ejected at speeds characteristic of protostellar outflows .",
    "we note in that study the `` fossil '' nature of the driving outflows was not addressed .",
    "the velocity of the wind in the simulations was reduced from @xmath21 to zero rather abruptly .",
    "a protostellar outflow would likely expire less dramatically .",
    "the ensuing rarefaction and cavity infall would proceed with less voracity than in these models and the deviation of the cavity size from the scaling relation should be less than the prediction given by our models . therefore , the net momentum inferred from the size of an observed cavity at @xmath38 using the scaling relation should be accurate to within a factor of a few .",
    "by @xmath96 , the radial edges of both the jet and wide angle wind driven cavities have decelerated to @xmath97 . at later time",
    ", a real fossil cavity would be disrupted by the ambient turbulence of its parent cloud .",
    "the cavity would become observationally confused with the ambient turbulence .",
    "figure 7 shows that the scaling relation provides a prediction of the cavity volume that is accurate to within a factor of a few for @xmath98 .",
    "thus we conclude that the scaling laws capture a reasonable approximation of the cavity behavior and the conclusions of @xcite relating to the momentum injection , outflow dynamics and turbulent energy balance in ngc 1333 are supported by our simulations .      in this section we present synthetic position velocity ( pv ) diagrams of our simulations . in particular , we seek characteristics of fossil outflows that are readily distinguished by observation .",
    "pv diagrams are commonly used to visualize observational data of molecular outflows .",
    "specifically , pv diagrams represent the distribution of molecular gas at each velocity in the direction of the line of sight at each position along a slit placed across a molecular outflow .",
    "we construct pv diagrams for each of the simulations presented here at four angles of inclination to the plane of the sky , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the synthetic pv data presented below have been processed through a gaussian filter with half - width @xmath103 and @xmath104 .    in figure [ f8 ]",
    "synthetic pv diagrams of molecular gas in the simulation domain have been taken along the z - axis at four angles of inclination to the plane of the sky for the jet driven fossil cavity .",
    "the densest gas along the outer wall of the cavity appears as a horizontal bell - shaped distribution of gray scales when the fossil cavity is oriented with its symmetry axis parallel to the plane of the sky ( upper left ) . note that gas expelled radially from the head of the outflow subsequently decelerates as it flows backwards ( in the frame of the outflow head ) .",
    "the gas that is closest to the outflow source has decelerated the most . at these positions gas",
    "appearing at higher velocity than the cavity walls is backfilling from the inner cavity wall into the cavity . by the end of the simulation",
    "the speed of the radial infall exceeds the radial expansion of the cavity walls .    at oblique orientations ( figure [ f8 ] , upper right and lower left )",
    ", we identify a distinct right triangle - shaped feature .",
    "the vertical leg of the triangle represents the fastest moving gas at the head of the outflow .",
    "the horizontal leg appears due to the subsonic backfill of the cavity walls .",
    "the hypotenuse is the hubble law flow formed through velocity segregation as material closest to the head of the flow propagates fastest and material closest to the source has decelerated the most .",
    "when the line of sight with the outflow axis is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the sky ( lower right ) only the axial velocity contributes to the pv diagram .",
    "now the fastest moving material appears within the observed central spike and the most decelerated material appears furthest from the central source .",
    "+    we can contrast the pv distribution of the jet driven fossil cavity with its continuously driven counterpart ( figure [ f9 ] ) .",
    "again , the densest gas delineates a bell shape when the outflow axis is oriented parallel to the plane of the sky . in this case",
    "there is no stationary material in contrast to the fossil cavity .",
    "because the outflow is driven from the boundary of the grid is initially atomic and hence not revealed in the pv data and the continuous driving does not allow backfilling into the cavity , there is no transition between the radial expansion and infall within the outflow structure and hence no stationary gas .",
    "also , in contrast to the fossil cavity at oblique inclinations , the velocity of gas follows a faster than linear increase in velocity with distance from the source .",
    "gas that is radially expelled from the head of the outflow is highly supersonic with @xmath105 .",
    "the propagation of the head of the fossil cavity is nearly an order of magnitude lower .",
    "the continuously driven jet is subject to greater radiative energy loss and hence a lower cocoon pressure than the fossil jet .",
    "the greater loss of this pressure support causes radially expanding gas to undergo a more rapid deceleration than in the fossil cavity case , yielding the faster increase in velocity from the outflow source .",
    "+    most of the features of the pv data for jet driven fossil cavities applies to the pv data of the wide angle wind driven cavity ( figure [ f10 ] ) .",
    "one notable difference is that the densest gas along the cavity wall , delineated by a bell shape at zero inclination to the plane of the sky , retains some radial expansion close to the outflow source .",
    "the wide angle wind applies ram pressure driving to the entire perimeter of the cavity walls rather than solely at the head of the outflow as in the jet driven case .",
    "this prevents the stall of radial expansion of the base of the outflow .",
    "+    similarly , the features present in the pv data for continuously driven jets apply also to the continuously driven wide angle wind ( figure [ f11 ] ) . in this case , however , the radial expansion of the outflow near the source exceeds the radial expansion at the tip of the outflow .",
    "this is due to the isotropic ram pressure of the driving wind that prohibits the stall of the cavity expansion near the base of the source .     +    in each configuration , jet , wide angle , fossil and driven , the condensed gas at the head of the cavity has retained most of the momentum injected by the wind .",
    "this appears as a central spike in the pv diagrams where the outflow axis is oriented directly toward the observer .",
    "the wide angle wind cases reveal greater rates of radial expansion near the base of the outflow than their jet driven counterparts . because the wide angle winds used in these simulations produce a relatively collimated outflow structure ,",
    "this is only easily distinguished when the outflow axis is oriented along the plane of the sky . in the simulations of continuously driven winds",
    "( figures [ f9 ] & [ f11 ] ) , most of the gas entrained in the outflow is concentrated at velocities that follow a slightly faster than linear increase in velocity with position from the driving source at oblique inclinations .",
    "this result was also noted in the jet driven outflow models of @xcite .",
    "molecular gas that has backfilled into the cavity after the driving source has expired appears at each position in the pv diagram at low and intermediate velocity .",
    "in this paper we have presented amr simulations of molecular outflows driven into an ambient molecular cloud .",
    "we have compared simulations of a fossil cavity driven by a previously active jet , and that of a continuously driven jet .",
    "we also have compared simulations of a fossil cavity driven by a previously active wide angle wind to that of a continuously driven wind .",
    "previous numerical simulations of molecular outflow have focused only on outflows driven by active sources .",
    "we find that the fossil cavities reach similar length scales as their continuously driven counterparts at much later times .",
    "their aspect ratios approach a constant value , where s those of the continuously driven outflows continue to increase .",
    "hence the fossil cavities are wider than their continuously driven counterparts .",
    "we find that the density contrast ( the ratio of the density outside the cavity to that inside ) drops with time , due to backfill of wind - swept ambient gas into the cavity . at later times",
    "fossil cavities can have low density contrasts of order unity .",
    "we have shown that a scaling law for self - similar flow derived from momentum conservation roughly predicts the volume of the fossil cavity .",
    "the fossil cavities expand somewhat faster than predicted from the scaling law .",
    "the success of the scaling law implies that observed sizes and velocities of cavities can be used to estimate the total momentum input required to create them .",
    "this point is crucial when using outflows as sources in energy budget arguments for re - energizing molecular cloud turbulent motions .",
    "we find that synthetic position velocity plots of the fossil cavities exhibit hubble law expansion patterns at intermediate viewing angles , whereas both fossil and active outflows contain spur patterns caused by the head of a bow shock .",
    "our simulations of continuously driven outflows lack hubble law patterns in the pv plots .",
    "it is tempting to consider the possibility that cavities that exhibit hubble flows are fossil cavities rather than continuously driven outflows .",
    "however , previous simulations that have enhanced entrainment have also succeeded in showing hubble laws .",
    "furthermore some observed hubble law flows have high velocities and so are likely to be actively driven ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretation of slowly expanding cavities in ngc 1333 as the relics of past outflow activity is supported by our simulations .",
    "the simulated fossil outflow cavities have a lifetime @xmath106 that of the duration of their driving source .",
    "therefore , we expect fossil cavities to appear with @xmath107 the frequency of active outflows in molecular star forming regions .",
    "@xcite arrived at a similar estimate from statistical considerations of the frequency of cavities they observed in ngc 1333 compared to the frequency of active outflows .",
    "the outflow swept cavities that remain as relics of previous yso outflow activity provide a link between outflow activity and the turbulent support of some molecular clouds .",
    "fossil outflows retain speeds above the turbulent velocity of their parent cloud on a timescale greater than the lifetime of the driving source .",
    "therefore , the fossil relic stage of an outflow s lifetime will result in the entrainment of a considerable amount of ambient molecular material in addition to that which was swept up during the lifetime of the driving source . as ambient gas entrained into the cavity flow",
    ", the expansion of cavities will decelerate to speeds comparable to the turbulent speed of the ambient could .",
    "the coupling of the momentum carried by cavities will couple to the turbulent motions in the could via their disruption by the preexisting turbulent media into which they are injected , by the slow collision and overlap of two or more cavities or both .",
    "future work should study the details of the mechanisms by which fossil cavities can re - energize a turbulent media through such coupling .",
