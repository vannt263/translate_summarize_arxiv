    "extremal dynamics has been employed extensively in modelling far from equilibrium systems such as biological evolution @xcite and driven interfaces @xcite .",

    "indeed , it was suggested some time ago that the appearance of  self - organized \" scaling properties in extremal dynamics and in sandpile models corresponds to forcing the order parameter ( associated with an underlying phase transition ) to zero from above @xcite . the purpose of this work is to explore the connection between these scaling properties and those observed at a phase transition to an absorbing state .",
    "the connection between extremal dynamics and directed percolation ( dp ) , the prime example of an absorbing - state phase transition , was first suggested by paczuski , maslov and bak @xcite and investigated in detail by these authors in the context of the bak - sneppen ( bs ) model and related processes @xcite .",

    "these studies indicate that self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite under extremal dynamics arises because the system is driven to a critical point associated with a phase transition to an absorbing state @xcite , as is also the case for sandpiles @xcite .    in the present work we are particularly interested in the modifications needed to transform a ( non - extremal , non - soc ) model having an absorbing state to one exhibiting soc under extremal dynamics .",

    "two examples ( the bs model and an extremal contact process ) are studied in detail , yielding refined estimates for critical properties , and evidence of a new universality class associated with absorbing phase transitions under extremal dynamics .",
    "the prime example of extremal dynamics is the bs model @xcite , proposed to explain mass extinctions observed in the fossil record . while its application in the evolutionary context is debated @xcite , it remains an intriguing and incompletely understood example of scaling behavior far from equilibrium .",
    "the contact process ( cp ) @xcite is the most familiar example of a markov process exhibiting a phase transition to an absorbing state .",

    "the _ state _ @xmath16 of site @xmath17 is 0 or 1 , the latter value denoting an active site , the former an inactive one .",
    "for each site @xmath17 in @xmath12 we define a neighborhood @xmath18 , or , more generally , a set of neighborhoods @xmath19 , @xmath20, ... ,@xmath21 .",

    "@xmath23 say , is chosen at random from the collection , with probability @xmath24 , and a rule @xmath25 is applied to the site or sites in @xmath26 . in general @xmath0 ( or @xmath25 ) is a probabilistic rule . at each step",
    "the number of active sites may change , and if at any moment there are no active sites ( @xmath27 ) , the process has fallen into an absorbing state and there is no further evolution .",

    "( the event space here is the set of all realizations of the process up to time @xmath33 , starting from a given initial probability distribution on configuration space . )",
    "if the stationary order parameter , defined by @xmath37 , vanishes , the process is said to be in the _ absorbing phase _ ; otherwise it is in the _ active _ phase .",

    ".    the following three - site contact process ( cp3 ) will play an important role in our analysis @xcite .",

    "@xmath11 suffers an absorbing - state phase transition at @xmath73 .",
    "we now define two related processes , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the former , _ extremal absorbing _ process , is obtained by modifying how the central site is selected .",
    "instead of choosing it at random from among the currently active sites , it is taken to be _ the active site having the smallest _ @xmath68 .",
    "as in the original process @xmath11 , if there are no active sites ( i.e. , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) , the process has reached an absorbing configuration and the evolution ceases .",
    "thus @xmath74 possesses an absorbing state , and since the original process @xmath11 exhibits a phase transition between an active and an absorbing phase as the control parameter @xmath62 is varied , we expect @xmath74 to as well , at some value @xmath78 .",
    "( the reason is that the relative likelihood of generating and destroying active sites varies with @xmath62 , just as in @xmath11 . )",
    "mean - field theory ( see appendix ) yields @xmath79 . due to the different correlations generated under extremal dynamics , however , the critical value @xmath78 of @xmath74 is in general different from @xmath80 .",
    "we define the _ extremal _ process @xmath75 by relaxing the condition in @xmath74 , that the extremal site @xmath17 must be active ( i.e. , have @xmath81 ) for the dynamics to proceed . if @xmath11 is the original contact process , then @xmath75 is a process in which either the minimal site or one of its nearest neighbors is updated at each step .",
    "if @xmath11 is the cp3 , @xmath75 is the familiar bak - sneppen model .",
    "note that @xmath75 has no absorbing state , hence no phase transition to such a state .",
    "its stationary properties are nevertheless intimately connected with the critical - point properties of @xmath74 , as we now explain .    of particular interest",
    "is the stationary probability density @xmath82 of site variables under extremal dynamics . as is well known , @xmath83 in the bak - sneppen model , in the infinite - size limit .",
    "( @xmath84 is the normalization factor . )",
    "we expect @xmath82 to exhibit a step - function singularity in any extremal model @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this feature is in fact already present in the original absorbing - state model @xmath11 at its critical point , because at the critical point @xmath73 , the stationary density of active sites ( having @xmath85 ) tends to zero as the system size @xmath13 goes to infinity .",
    "the distribution on the  allowed \" region @xmath86 is uniform , since the @xmath87 are drawn from a uniform distribution .",
    "thus @xmath82 jumps from zero to a finite value at @xmath88 . in the _",
    "supercritical _ regime ( @xmath89 ) , @xmath82 is equal to a constant @xmath90 for @xmath67 , such that @xmath91 ( the order parameter ) , and takes a different constant value , @xmath92 , on the interval @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "once again , the stationary density is discontinuous at @xmath94 .",
    "what holds for @xmath11 also holds qualitatively for @xmath74 .",
    "the critical value @xmath78 may , as noted , differ from @xmath80 , but since @xmath74 exhibits an absorbing - state phase transition , its stationary distribution @xmath82 also has a step - function singularity . just at @xmath95 , the order parameter @xmath96 , but as @xmath97 the survival time of the process tends to infinity .",
    "this means that the process can survive indefinitely , with the choice of the central site _ restricted to the set having _ @xmath98 .",
    "the presence of active sites in the range @xmath99 is then irrelevant , since a site with @xmath98 is always available .",
    "thus for @xmath100 , the distribution @xmath82 exhibits a step - function singularity at @xmath78 .",
    "extremal dynamics effectively  pins \" the singularity at @xmath78 .",
    "the foregoing remarks on @xmath74 obtain in the infinite - size limit ; for finite @xmath13 there is a nonzero probability ( for @xmath101 ) , that all sites have @xmath86 so that the system eventually becomes trapped in the absorbing state .",
    "( the mean lifetime , however , is expected to grow exponentially with @xmath13 , for @xmath102 . )    in summary , if @xmath11 exhibits an absorbing - state phase transition , then @xmath74 should as well , although not necessarily at the same value of @xmath62 .",
    "the distribution @xmath82 possesses a step function singularity in both cases . near the critical point ( @xmath103 ) of the original process",
    "@xmath11 we expect @xmath104 , with @xmath105 the critical exponent associated with the order parameter .",
    "below the upper critical dimension ( @xmath106 for dp @xcite ) , @xmath107 . in the supercritical regime of @xmath74 ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath108 since @xmath82 jumps from zero to a finite value at @xmath109 .",
    "thus the order parameter exponent @xmath105 is _ unity _ in @xmath74 .",
    "this is but one example showing that the extremal condition changes the value of a critical exponent .",
    "another example , established some time ago by paczuski and coworkers @xcite , is that the spreading exponent @xmath4 ( defined sec .",
    "iii.c ) is generically zero for extremal dynamics , whereas @xmath110 for directed percolation .",
    "further evidence that extremal dynamics modifies critical exponent values will be given below .",
    "in @xmath111 , the central site is always chosen ( in the @xmath112 limit ) from the set @xmath113 , just as in @xmath74 at its critical point .",
    "since the order parameter is zero in the latter case , we may assert that extremal dynamics effectively tunes the order parameter to zero .",
    "( @xmath114 approaches zero from above as @xmath112 . )",
    "as we have seen , the existence of sites with @xmath115 becomes irrelevant in @xmath74 , in the infinite - size limit .",
    "in other words , @xmath111 is identical to the critical process @xmath74 in this limit .",
    "( starting from the same initial configuration , and using the same set of random numbers , the same sequence of sites will be updated in the two processes . )",
    "since the extremal version of the cp3 is the familiar bak - sneppen model , we shall refer to the cp3@xmath116 as the _ absorbing bak - sneppen _ ( abs ) model .",
    "our objective is to characterize the behavior of the abs model and of the extremal and ea versions of the contact process .",
    "the abs model is closely related to the @xmath0-_avalanche _ process studied in ref .",
    "an @xmath0-avalanche ( in the present notation , @xmath62-avalanche ) , begins when the minimal site variable @xmath117 , the minimum having been _ greater _ than @xmath62 at the preceding step or steps , and continues until the minimum is once again @xmath118 .",
    "( as @xmath62 approaches @xmath78 from below , the mean avalanche duration diverges . )",
    "the dynamics of the bs model continues , regardless of whether a given avalanche has terminated or not .",
    "but in the abs model @xmath119 represents an absorbing state and the dynamics ceases . in the bs model , it is common to analyze the properties of @xmath62-avalanches in the stationary state .",
    "it is similarly of interest to study stationary properties of the abs model , attained once the system has relaxed , after an initial transient period .",
    "we may also study the mean lifetime of the active state as a function of system size .",
    "another approach to studying absorbing - state phase transitions consists in following the spread of activity starting from a single active site .",
    "this spreading phenomenon in the bs model was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is called the bs branching process , and in ref .",
    "@xcite under the name of the bs(@xmath120 ) model .",
    "the assertions regarding extremal and extremal - absorbing models are supported by mean - field theory ( mft ) , which is presented in the appendix .",
    "in particular , for the abs model @xmath121 , just as in the mft of the original bs model . in the extremal and the extremal - absorbing contact process , the stationary probability densities exhibit ( for @xmath122 ) , _ two _ discontinuities , one at @xmath123 , the other at @xmath124 . [ these coalesce at @xmath125 . note that the parameter @xmath62 continues to influence the form of @xmath126 in the extremal contact process , due to the nature of the updating rule , eqs .",
    "( [ f0cp ] ) and ( [ fpmcp ] ) . ]",
    "these predictions are in qualitative agreement with simulation .",
    "before discussing our results we insert an observation on simulations of the bs model .",
    "since the site with the smallest variable , @xmath127 , must be identified at each step , it becomes important to devise an effective search strategy .",
    "an efficient general - purpose search algorithm uses a binary tree structure to identify @xmath127 .",
    "one approach @xcite utilizes a lattice of @xmath128 sites . at the first level of selection ,",
    "each site is compared with one of its neighbors and the minimum of the pair selected . at the next level",
    "the minimum between each neighboring pair is selected , and so on , so that at the @xmath30-th level the global minimum is identified .    a second binary scheme @xcite is formulated as follows .",
    "site 0 is placed at the apex of the tree .",
    "site 1 is placed on the level below the apex , to the left of 0 if @xmath129 , to the right if @xmath130 .",
    "a site @xmath17 is added to the tree in the following way : we go down the tree comparing @xmath68 with the variables @xmath131 , turning left or right depending on whether @xmath68 is smaller or larger than @xmath87 , until we find an empty site . building the tree in this way , @xmath127 will occupy the leftmost position in the tree . in these schemes , maintaining the tree structure , once constructed from the initial set of variables @xmath68 , requires a small number of operations at each step , and is many times more efficient that a repeated global search for the minimim .",
    "we find , nonetheless , that a suitably _ restricted _ search requires less cpu time in the stationary state .",
    "a special property of the bs model ( shared by its absorbing version , and by other extremal models ) , is that the minimal site falls , with a probability approaching unity as the system size grows , in the interval @xmath132 $ ] . at the same time",
    "the density of sites with values in this interval approaches zero as @xmath112 .",
    "this suggests maintaining a list of sites having @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "then the search for @xmath127 may be restricted to the list , except for the rare instances in which the latter is empty .",
    "( for the abs we must in any case restrict the search to sites with @xmath134 . )",
    "if the system is large , so that the typical number of sites with @xmath67 is not small , it becomes advantageous to introduce a _",

    "( the occasional need to perform a global search , in the rare instances when both lists are empty , is more than compensated by their reduced sizes when using these values . )",
    "compared with the binary tree method , our approach results in threefold reduction in cpu time , in the stationary state , for a system of 1000 sites .",
    "( the binary tree approach may prove more efficient for studying transients , since initially the lists will not be short , if the @xmath68 values are chosen uniformly on [ 0,1 ] . )      using the simulation method described above , we conducted extensive studies of the one - dimensional abs model .",
