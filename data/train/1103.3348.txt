    "non - commutative gravity theories are receiving much attention in the literature because they are part of a promising research program aimed at developing an algebraic approach to the longstanding problem of quantum gravity.@xmath0 in particular , we are here concerned with the developments described in refs . 2 and 3 .",
    "the work in ref .",
    "2 has built a geometric theory of non - commutative gravity where the lagrangian is a globally defined 4-form , invariant under diffeomorphisms as well as @xmath1-diffeomorphisms and where in the commutative limit only the classical field degrees of freedom survive .",
    "for pure gravity the action functional reads as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the tetrad 1-form and @xmath4 is the curvature 2-form @xmath5 as in ref .",
    "2 we expand the tetrad on the basis of @xmath6-matrices , @xmath7 on denoting by @xmath8 the minkowski metric , and defining @xmath9 , one similarly expands the spin - connection 1-form @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are 1-forms . from ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , one has @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are 2-forms .",
    "we here correct some numerical factors in eqs .",
    "( 5.2 ) and ( 5.3 ) of ref . 2 and write the following explicit formulae for the components of the curvature in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 we explicitly write in components the equations obtained by varying the action ( [ ( 1 ) ] ) with respect to the tetrad components @xmath19 and @xmath20 , they respectively read as @xmath21 @xmath22 we notice that eq .",
    "( 10 ) can be obtained by the replacements @xmath23 and @xmath24 in eq .",
    "the torsion 2-form is defined by @xmath25 and expanding @xmath26 on the basis of @xmath6-matrices as in eq .",
    "( 2 ) we have @xmath27 .",
    "variation of the action with respect to the spin - connection gives the remaining field equation @xmath28 , where we use curly brackets for anticommutators .",
    "since @xmath29 is even in the @xmath6-matrices we eventually obtain @xmath30 which is satisfied by a vanishing torsion .",
    ".4 cm the work in ref .",
    "3 has studied the seiberg ",
    "witten map@xmath31 which relates non - commutative degrees of freedom for spin - connection , tetrad and gauge parameter to their commutative counterparts .",
    "the relation is such that non - commutative gauge transformations ( with non - commutative gauge parameter @xmath32 ) correspond to commutative gauge transformations ( with commutative gauge parameter @xmath33 ) .",
    "for example for the tetrad we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the non - commutative tetrad 1-form , while @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the usual commutative tetrad and spin - connection .",
    "the non - commutativity we consider is given by the moyal ",

    "equation ( [ ( 17 ) ] ) can be solved order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ ( 17 ) ] ) to first order in the non - commutativity @xmath42 has the general structure @xmath43 the zeroth- and first - order terms in @xmath39 in eq .",

    "hence we expand equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) in terms of the commutative tetrad and spin - connection .",
    "this is done to first order in @xmath51 by inserting the first - order seiberg ",
    "witten map ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 18)(20 ) .",
    "we have done so when the underlying classical geometry is the spherically symmetric solution of the classical einstein equations in vacuum , i.e. schwarzschild .",
    "by virtue of the wedge-@xmath1 product of forms defined in ref .",
    "2 , for any 1-form @xmath52 and any 2-form @xmath53 , one can write ( provided that @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 @xmath56 eq .",
    "( [ ( 26 ) ] ) can be applied repeatedly to the @xmath57-expansion of eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) . for this purpose",
    "we need from eq .",
    "( [ ( 26 ) ] ) the identities @xmath58 @xmath59 moreover , from the work in ref .",
    "2 we know that in non - commutative field theory charge - conjugation conditions imply that @xmath60 and hence all non - commutative fields that are not present in the commutative case are at least proportional to @xmath57 ( and hence vanish in the commutative limit ) , @xmath61 by virtue of ( [ ( 27 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 28 ) ] ) and ( [ ( 30 ) ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ ( 9 ) ] ) reduces to @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the @xmath64-th order part of the curvature 2-form in powers of @xmath42 , while eq .",

    "( [ ( 31 ) ] ) , since @xmath67 is the classical tetrad , the term @xmath68 vanishes for any solution of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "now we consider the coordinates @xmath69 and the tetrad @xmath70 given by @xmath71 this tetrad with the associated spin - connection ( see formula ( 34 ) below ) describe a schwarzschild geometry solution of the classical einstein equations in first - order formalism . for this tetrad we have @xmath72 ,",
    "so that eq .",
    "( [ ( 31 ) ] ) becomes an identity . in order to try to solve the first - order non - commutative equations ( [ ( 32 ) ] ) we consider for the first - order expression of the non - commutative tetrad the expression given by eq .",
    "( [ ( 20 ) ] ) , which is the first - order seiberg  witten map for the tetrad .",
    "this ansatz is supported by the following argument :    to first order in @xmath57 the non - commutative einstein action ( 1 ) is the same as the commutative one if the non - comutative fields are re - expressed in terms of the commutative ones by using the seiberg  witten map ( indeed the non - commutative fields satisfy the charge conjugation conditions of ref .",
    "therefore it is expected that the non - commutative einstein equations are automatically satisfied if the non - commutative fields are expressed via seiberg ",
    "witten map in terms of the commutative ones .",
    "we then substitute eq .",
    "( [ ( 20 ) ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ ( 32 ) ] ) , we relabel the indices summed over , and assuming ( for ease of calculations ) that only the non - commutativity component @xmath73 ( that we rename @xmath57 ) is non - vanishing , i.e. @xmath74 we re - express eq .",

    "( [ ( 36 ) ] ) takes the form @xmath79 where each @xmath80 can be written as the sum of @xmath81 terms .",

    "( [ ( 32 ) ] ) , where no use of the seiberg  witten map is made , and look for solutions of eq .",
    "( [ ( 32 ) ] ) and also of the torsion constraints in eq .",
    "( [ ( 12 ) ] ) . .4 cm in conclusion , the performed calculation shows that there is a mismatch between : ( i ) using the seiberg ",
    "witten map in the non - commutative action ( 1 ) in order to express all non - commutative fields in terms of the commutative tetrad and spin - connection , and then solving the action ( that in general will be a higher derivative action ) by varying with respect to only the classical fields .",
    "+ ( ii ) obtaining the non - commutative field equations by varying the action ( 1 ) with respect to all non - commutative fields , and then trying to solve these equations by expressing the non - commutative fields in terms of the commutative ones via seiberg  witten map .",
    "this mismatch can be due to the fact that in case ( ii ) , in order to obtain the equations of motion we have to vary also with respect to the extra fields @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "exactly these corresponding extra equations of motion are not satisfied by considering the field configurations @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath90 obtained by the seiberg  witten map with @xmath91 and @xmath92 the classical black hole tetrad and spin - connection . .4",
    "cm    we also notice that we have chosen the non - commutativity directions @xmath93 and @xmath94 not to be killing vector fields for our classical black hole solution .",
    "this was done on purpose because , similarly to refs.@xmath95}$ ] , it is possible to show that , when non - commutativity is ( in part ) obtained by using killing vector fields of a given classical solution to einstein equations , then this classical solution is also a solution of the non - commutative field equations , where all the extra non - commutative fields are taken to vanish .",
