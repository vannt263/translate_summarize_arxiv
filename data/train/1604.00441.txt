    "this paper presents the initial implementation and demonstration of a novel work flow .",
    "certain parts are established technology using previously developed , but not widely used methods ( i.e. , stochastic wavelet derivation , sparse spike inversion based on the ideas of daubechies and mallat , net pay estimation using secant area , stochastic reflection response modeling using rock physics relationships derived from well logs , and geostatistical simulation of lateral correlation taking into account well measurements ) .",
    "this not withstanding , significant development was needed to assimilate these capabilities in an integrated workflow .",
    "other parts were novel technology that was developed and applied for the first time ( i.e. , the stochastic aspect of the sparse spike inversion and the net pay estimation ) .",
    "the details and synthetic benchmarking of this technology suite will be discussed in sec .",

    "more specifically , the wavelet derivation and seismic noise estimation will be discussed in sec .",

    "[ net.pay.estimation ] , the two step calibration process that includes the stochastic reflection response modeling will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ calibration ] , and how the lateral correlation and well measurements of net pay are built into the ensemble of net pay estimates will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ lateral.correlation ] .    this methodology will be demonstrated on the cassra / iris field .",
    "these licenses ( block 22 and ncma-4 ) lie on the regional patao high basement structure located within the west tobago basin , offshore the north coast of trinidad and to the northwest coast of tobago ( see fig .",
    "[ geology.fig ] ) .",
    "the area contains primarily upper miocene to pleistocene aged clastic sediments resting on a heterogeneous basement of jurassic / cretaceous age consisting of metamorphic and igneous rocks .    in the block 22 license ,",
    "the cassra gas discovery is contained in the uppermost early pliocene m0 reservoir sands . in ncma-4 ,",
    "the iris gas discovery is in pleistocene aged reservoir sands , termed up5 .",
    "the hydrocarbon system consists of mainly combination structural - stratigraphic traps , formed by compactional drape over basement structural highs , which are sealed by intra - formational shales / silts that also provide the dry biogenic gas source for all the gas discoveries and producing fields of the basin .     the geological context of the cassra / iris field : ( a ) map showing location of the field , the dotted line shows the location of the cross section shown in ( b ) geologic cross section of the field , ( c ) stratigraphic section indicating the two main reservoir units . ]",
    "cassra is the main discovered resource in block 22 with the resource area being clearly defined on 3d seismic data as a strong amplitude anomaly covering around @xmath0 .",
    "the trap is a combination structural - stratigraphic trap in good quality reservoir sands of early pliocene age , known locally as the m0 reservoir .",
    "strong clinoformal geometries are seen on seismic and attest to the progradation of smaller - scale `` parasquence - set '' within the overall sand body unit .",

    "the volumetric distribution is corrected for a reduction in amplitude over part of the area due to shallow gas .",
    "the theory and the methodology is presented in the following subsections :      a wavelet derivation engine , originally developed by @xcite , was used to estimate the seismic wavelet .",
    "more graphic details can be found in a presentation by @xcite .",
    "this wavelet derivation derives one wavelet that matches multiple , possibly deviated wells .",
    "it also estimates the vertical time - to - depth mapping , the lateral placement of the seismic , the length of the wavelet , and the seismic noise level .",
    "all of these have their uncertainty estimated .",
    "the results of the application of this will be shown in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "the wavelet and the seismic noise level are explicitly used to do the stochastic sparse spike inversion described in sec .",
    "[ stochastic.ssi ] .",
    "the time - to - depth mapping and lateral placement can be used to locate the well on the seismic and to understand the uncertainty in that placement .      the basic sparse spike inversion engine behind the stochastic sparse spike inversion ( 3si ) ,",
    "was developed by @xcite based on the concepts of @xcite .",
    "it has guaranteed convergence to norm , that is to say that it has no problems with being trapped in local minimums .",
    "this is a very important property of the inversion .",
    "other industry inversions must build low frequency models , then use these to constrain their results away from the local minimums . in the process , they consume much project time in building the low frequency model , and bias the result away from the correct solution in the process .",
    "examples of these destructive behaviors will be shown later in sec .",
    "[ net.pay.estimation ] .",
    "the results are integrated ( by a running sum or runsum , for short ) , the running mean is removed @xcite to eliminate the divergence at small scale .",
    "this result can be directly compared to the logarithm of the acoustic impedance .",
    "the free parameters of this inversion ( seismic noise level or spikiness , and the length of the zero mean gate ) are estimated by minimizing the deviation of the sparse spike inversion result on the seismic data at the wells from the well log measurements of acoustic impedance .    the uncertainty in this inversion is then estimated by a bootstrap procedure .",
    "an ensemble of inversions are generated by the following recipe .",
    "to generate one member of the ensemble , a wavelet is chosen at random from the ensemble of wavelets generated by the wavelet derivation in sec .",
    "[ wavelet.derivation ] .",
    "a perturbed version is created of the original seismic by adding band limited white noise to the measured seismic .",
    "the amount of the noise is consistent with the noise level determined by the stochastic wavelet derivation .",
    "the bandwidth of the noise is that of the measured seismic data . a sparse spike inversion",
    "is then done using this version of the wavelet and the seismic data . as many members of the ensemble , as needed to obtain sufficient statistical accuracy in the distributions , are generated by repeating these steps .",

    "the proper way to extract amplitudes and amplitude thicknesses from `` runsum '' data , is the secant method .",

    "an advantage in using secant area is that it is insensitive to phase , up to first order in the error in the phase .",
    "it is also an intensive property , not an extensive property like a root mean square ( rms ) amplitude . in other words ,",
    "the amplitude is not dependent on the length or choice of the interval .",
    "the secant points are uniquely defined and can be determined as part of the algorithm , where the the end points for the rms are determined outside the algorithm by the analyst .",
