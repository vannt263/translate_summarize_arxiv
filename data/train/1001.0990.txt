    "infinite divisibility or stochastic stability of a random object under a certain operation is one of the most fundamental concepts in probability theory , prominent examples including the classical theory of infinite divisible and stable distributions with their applications around the central limit theorem , max - stable distributions studied in extreme value theory or union infinitely divisible random sets studied in the classical theory of random closed sets @xcite .",
    "+ in the present paper we will deal with non - stationary iteration infinitely divisible random tessellations of the @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space and more specifically with stationary random tessellations that are * * st**able under the operation of * * it**eration  called stit tessellations for short . in the stationary case , the purely mathematical motivation for this type of random tessellations goes back to r. ambartzumian in the 80thies .",
    "the principle of iteration of tessellations can roughly be explained as follows : take a random primary or frame tessellation and associate with each of its cells an independent copy of the tessellation itself , a component tessellation , which is also independent of the primary tessellation as well .",
    "now make in each cell a local superposition of the primary tessellation and the associated tessellation , whereupon scale the resulting random tessellation by a factor @xmath2 in order to ensure that the mean surface measure of cell boundaries stays constant . the described operation can now be repeatedly applied and we obtain in this way a sequence of random tessellations .",
    "it can be shown that this sequence converges to a random limit tessellation and that this tessellation must be stable under iterations  a stit tessellation  in the translation - invariant set - up . in the general case , the resulting tessellation is iteration infinitely divisible in any finite volume , where this property has the same relation to iteration stable random tessellations as infinitely divisible random variables have to stable ones .",
    "+ starting with @xcite , stit tessellations and their theoretical framework were formally introduced in @xcite by w. nagel and v. weiss .",
    "it was the same research group who discovered a first basic technique for studying mean values and even some distributions related to the geometry of stit tessellations by writing certain balance equations based on the stochastic stability of the tessellation , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the mean values as well as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for distributional results . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "a new aspect was introduced into the theory , namely a tessellation - valued random markov process on the positive real half - axis with the property that at each time the law of of the tessellation is stable under iteration .",
    "this process sheds light on the hierarchical and temporal structure of stit tessellations and leads to a random process of cell divisions in any finite volume and moreover in the whole space .",
    "this point of view can be exploited to establish further results on stit tessellations and in fact we will also make use of it in the present paper . in addition , the finite volume markovian construction provides a link to the class of more general and non - stationary iteration infinitely divisible random tessellations .",
    "+ in next subsection [ secstit ] we outline important facts about stit tessellations and introduce the concept of iteration infinitely divisible random tessellations .",
    "afterwards , in subsection [ secoverview ] the plan of the paper as well as a survey of our main results are presented .",
    "a tessellation of @xmath0 is a locally finite partition of the space into compact convex polytopes , the cells of the tessellation .",
    "one can regard a tessellation either as a collection of its cells or as the closed set of their boundaries .",
    "we will mostly follow the second mentioned path and denote by @xmath3 the set of cells of the tessellation @xmath4 ( by the jordan  schnflies theorem the correspondence between @xmath4 and @xmath3 is one - to - one ) .",
    "thus , a random tessellation can be regarded as a special random closed set in the sense of @xcite . in particular , this imposes the usual fell topology and the corresponding borel measurable structure on the family of tessellations , see ibidem . a random tessellation @xmath4 ( regarded as a random closed set in @xmath0 ) is called _ stationary _ if its distribution does not change upon actions of translations .",
    "analogously a random tessellation is called _ isotropic _ if its distribution is invariant under the action of @xmath5 .",
    "+ whenever we have two random tessellations @xmath6 and @xmath7 of @xmath0 we can define their _ iteration / nesting_. to do so , we associate to each cell @xmath8 an independent version @xmath9 of @xmath7 and we assume furthermore the family @xmath10 to be independent of @xmath6",
    ". then we can define the iteration of @xmath6 with @xmath7 by @xmath11 i.e. we take the local superposition of @xmath7 and the family @xmath10 inside the cells of @xmath6 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath12 is a stationary random tessellation as soon @xmath6 and @xmath7 are .",
    "a stationary random tessellation @xmath4 is called _",
    "stable under iteration _ or _ stit _ for short iff @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for equality in distribution , i.e. if its distribution does not change under rescaled iteration .",
    "in fact , using the uniqueness results , see theorem 3 and corollary 2 in @xcite , it is easy to see that it is enough to take one fixed @xmath15 in ( [ itstab ] ) .",
    "+ to proceed , let us be given a constant @xmath16 and a probability measure @xmath17 on the unit sphere @xmath18 usually identified with the induced distribution of orthogonal hyperplanes on the space @xmath19 of @xmath20-dimensional linear hyperplanes in @xmath21 also denoted by @xmath22 in the sequel for notational simplicity . define the measure @xmath23 on the space @xmath24 of affine hyperplanes in @xmath0 as the product measure @xmath25 of @xmath26 standing for the lebesgue measure on the positive real half - axis @xmath27 and of @xmath17 , where a pair @xmath28 is identified with the hyperplane @xmath29 throughout this paper we always require that the support of @xmath17 spans the whole space , i.e. @xmath30 assume now that we are given a stationary random tessellation @xmath4 with surface intensity @xmath31 ( i.e. the mean surface area of cell boundaries per unit volume equals @xmath31 ) and directional distribution @xmath17 ( i.e. the distribution of the normal direction of the face containing the typical point is given by @xmath17 ) and define the sequence @xmath32 by @xmath33 it was shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 3 ) that @xmath34 converges in law , as @xmath35 to a stationary random limit tessellation @xmath36 _ uniquely determined _ only by @xmath37 this tessellation is easily shown to be stable under iterations and is called the stit tessellation with parameters @xmath31 and @xmath23 . without confusion",
    "we will write @xmath38 instead of @xmath36 , whenever the measure @xmath23 or @xmath17 is fixed .",
    "it is a crucial feature of @xmath38 that it admits a very natural and intuitive _",
    "explicit construction_. for a restriction @xmath39 of @xmath38 to a compact convex window @xmath40 this construction can be informally be described as follows ( the reader is referred to @xcite for full details ) .",

    "the cell - separating @xmath20-dimensional facets arising in subsequent splits are usually referred to as i - faces ( or i - segments for @xmath50 as assuming shapes similar to the letter _ i _ ) .",
    "the described process of recursive cell divisions is called the mecke - nagel - weiss- or ( mnw)-construction in the sequel and the resulting random tessellation created inside @xmath41 is denoted by @xmath39 as mentioned above , whereas the collection of all i - facets or i - segments is denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , we write @xmath52 for the collection of @xmath53-dimensional i - faces of @xmath39 , where by a @xmath53-dimensional i - face we mean the maximal union of connected and @xmath53-coplanar @xmath53-dimensional faces .",
    "in fact , @xmath53-dimensional i - faces of @xmath39 can also be alternatively defined as the @xmath53-faces of i - facets .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the law of @xmath39 is consistent in @xmath54 i.e. @xmath55 for convex @xmath56 and thus @xmath39 can be extended to random tessellation @xmath57 on the whole space , which is then proved ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to coincide with the limit tessellation @xmath38 considered above , as the notation suggests . again",
    ", the sets of all i - facets and i - faces of @xmath38 are denoted by @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , respectively .",
    "the stationary random tessellation @xmath38 is additionally isotropic if and only if @xmath17 is the uniform distribution on @xmath18 . in this case",
    "we will write @xmath61 or @xmath62 for the invariant measure on the space of hyperplanes @xmath24 .",
    "+ a simple yet crucial observation is that even though only translation - invariant measures @xmath23 of the form ( [ ladef ] ) show up in the limiting stit tessellations , the mnw - construction can be carried out with arbitrary non - atomic and locally finite driving measure @xmath23 ( i.e. @xmath42 ) < \\infty$ ] for @xmath41 bounded ) on @xmath63 also leading to a consistent family @xmath39 and eventually , by extension , yielding @xmath64 many of our theorems below will be stated in this general context .",
    "it should be emphasised though that such tessellations are no more iteration stable ( stit ) . however , they have the general property of being _ iteration infinitely divisible _ , as they can be readily checked to arise as @xmath65-fold iterations of @xmath66 for each @xmath67 in all finite volumes .",
    "formally , this means that @xmath68 for all compact convex sets @xmath69 which follows directly by the mnw - construction as yielding @xmath70 it is more than natural to expect that also @xmath71 for all @xmath65 in the whole @xmath0 which should be easily provable by adopting the theory developed in @xcite , thus even better justifying the term _ iteration infinitely divisible _ in our context , yet this falls beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "+ the stit tessellations enjoy a number of remarkable properties .",
    "below , we recall some of them which will be of importance for our further argumentation .",
    "all proofs can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "* stit tessellations have poisson typical cells , i.e. under stationary @xmath23 the interior of the typical cell of @xmath38 - denoted by @xmath72 - has the same distribution as the interior of the typical cell of a stationary poisson hyperplane ( or line or plane ) tessellation with the same surface intensity @xmath73 and the same directional distribution @xmath74 see lemma 3 in @xcite .",
    "the difference between these two types of tessellations arises from the mutual arrangement of the cells , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . *",
    "sectional stit tessellations are stit tessellations as well .",
    "in particular , let @xmath75 be a @xmath53-dimensional plane in @xmath0 , @xmath76 , and let @xmath38 be a stationary and isotropic random stit tessellation with parameter @xmath73",
    ". then @xmath77 has the same distribution as the stationary and isotropic stit tessellation with parameter @xmath78 constructed inside the plane @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath79 with , cf .",
    "* ( 3.29 t ) ) @xmath80 by abusing the above introduced notation , where we have assumed the window to be compact . moreover , if @xmath81 the intersection of @xmath82 with @xmath38 induces a motion - invariant poisson process with intensity @xmath83 on the line @xmath82 . in view of the above considerations we see that the motion - invariant stit tessellations in dimension @xmath84 are the motion - invariant poisson processes ( note that in dimension @xmath84 motion - invariance is the same as translation - invariance ) .",
    "thus , stit tessellations can be seen as another generalization of the @xmath84-dimensional poisson process to higher dimensions beside other models , see @xcite . *",
    "stit tessellations have the following scaling property : @xmath85 i.e. the tessellation @xmath38 of surface intensity @xmath31 upon rescaling by factor @xmath31 has the same distribution as @xmath86 , the stit tessellation with surface intensity @xmath84 .",
    "we will use in the paper the same notation for iteration infinitely divisible random tessellation and stit tessellations hopefully without confusion , mentioning in any case if we are working with a general locally finite non - atomic measure @xmath23 , a translation - invariant one or even with @xmath61 .",
    "+ we will also make use of the following notation in the paper :    * @xmath87 is the @xmath1-dimensional ball around the origin with radius @xmath88 . *",
    "the @xmath53-dimensional volume measure will be denoted by @xmath89 .",
    "* @xmath90 is the volume of the @xmath91-dimensional unit ball , @xmath92 its surface area . *",
    "the uniform probability measure on the unit sphere @xmath18 in @xmath0 ( normalized spherical surface measure ) is denoted by @xmath93 .      as already remarked above ,",
    "a stit random tessellation induces a continuous time tessellation - valued markov process on the positive real half - axis . for such processes ,",
    "the notion of a generator is available .",
    "using standard theory of markov processes , several martingales associated with the tessellations under consideration can be constructed .",
    "this fundamental observation will be exploited in section [ secmartingale ] and most of our results will be based on it .",
    "+ in section [ secfirst ] we mainly deal with first - order properties and the typical geometry of iteration infinitely divisible or more specifically stationary and stationary and isotropic stit tessellations .",
    "we generalize some properties known for stit tessellations to the non - stationary case and derive explicit formulas for mean values and higher moments of @xmath53-dimensional i - faces in the isotropic case ( sections [ sectypifaces ] and [ sechigermoments ] ) . in particular we show that the distribution of the ( time - marked ) typical @xmath53-dimensional i - face is a mixture of suitably ( marked and ) rescaled @xmath53-dimensional poisson cells . as a main tool we use the martingale techniques introduced before and",
    "we compare the tessellations with certain mixtures of poisson hyperplane tessellations ( section [ seclowerdimfaces ] ) .",
    "typical geometry beyond the isotropic regime is explored in section [ secbehindiso ] , where for example the conditional distribution of the typical @xmath53-dimensional i - segment given its birth time for all space dimensions is determined and some global and local mean value formulas for the stationary as well as for the non - stationary case are derived .",
    "+ second - order parameters of iteration infinitely divisible and stit tessellations are the contents of section [ secsecond ] . based on a specialization of our martingale technique ( section [ secsecondmartingaletools ] ) , we calculate the variance of a general face - functional and as a special case we find the variance of the total surface area of cell boundaries in a bounded convex window .",
    "the resulting integral expression can be explicitly evaluated in the stationary and isotropic case by applying the affine blaschke - petkantschin formula ( section [ subsecvar ] ) . for the particular case of space dimension @xmath94 , an exact formula without further integrals",
    "is presented as well as general variance asymptotics relying on techniques from integral geometry .",
    "certain chord - power integrals will reflect the influence of the geometry of the observation window to this variance asymptotics .",
    "the purpose of section [ secalternative ] is to compare our martingale approach with a recent elegant second - order theory for stationary and isotropic planar stit tessellations independently developed by w. weiss , j. ohser and w. nagel . as a by - product , we derive there an explicit expression for the pair - correlation function of the random surface area measure in general space dimensions . for space dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath94 we also calculate the so - called @xmath95-function .",
    "+ following the afore - mentioned first- and second - order theory we turn in section [ secclt ] to the central limit problem for stit tessellations . in section [ secbrownianconv ]",
    "we show the convergence of the surface / length increment process wrt . to",
    "some initial time instant associated with stit tessellation to a time changed wiener process , the proof of which is based on the ergodicity property of stit tessellations and the functional central limit theorem for square - integrable martingales .",
    "it is interesting to see that in terms of the time incremental mnw - construction of stit tessellations our central limit theorem is more reliant on independencies arising in construction time than those of spatial nature .",
    "even more interestingly , the big - bang phase near time zero turns out to play a crucial rle . in section [ cltplane ]",
    "we establish normal convergence of the total edge length in the planar case and in section [ cltspace ] it is shown that non - normal limit distributions appear in the limit for space dimensions greater or equal @xmath94 .",
    "the argument goes by using our variance calculations from section [ secsecond ] and the observation that for space dimensions @xmath96 the initial big - bang phase of the mnw - construction brings a non - negligible contribution to the variance of the surface increment process , whereas in dimension @xmath2 this contribution is negligible but already with an extremely slow rate of decay .",
    "+ the aim of the last section ( section [ seccomparison ] ) is to put our results in a more general context by comparing them with the results for poisson hyperplane tessellations and for poisson - voronoi tessellations with the same surface intensity .",
    "+ in all cases , our general statements are illustrated by examples in space dimensions @xmath50 and @xmath97 , sometimes leading to already known formulas but often extending them at least in some aspects .",
    "+ our results could  beside their intrinsic mathematical motivation ",
    "be of potential interest for applications for example in context of questions concerning statistical model fitting of random tessellations to real data .",
    "central limit theorems could be a basis for statistical inference of tessellation models and related functionals .",
    "asymptotic confidence intervals and tests with respect to mean values can be derived from them , since we can make the first- and second - order moments explicitly available .",
    "the finite volume continuous time incremental mnw - construction of iteration infinitely divisible random tessellations or more specially stationary stit tessellations , as discussed in section [ secstit ] above , clearly enjoys the markov property in time parameter , whence natural martingales arise which will be of crucial importance for our further considerations . to discuss these processes",
    "we need some additional terminology and notational conventions .",
    "first , we fix a compact convex window @xmath41 and a general diffuse ( non - atomic ) and locally finite measure @xmath23 on @xmath98 next , whenever a new facet @xmath99 lying on a hyperplane @xmath100 is born in the course of the mecke - nagel - weiss- ( mnw)-construction , that is to say a cell splits , we declare that its _ initial / birth point _ is the point ( vertex ) with lowermost first coordinate , to be denoted @xmath101 in the sequel ( in fact any other deterministic and measurable algorithm of distinguishing one point of @xmath99 would do as well in this context ) .",
    "moreover , for a given tessellation @xmath4 ( usually taken to be @xmath39 for some @xmath102 ) we also introduce the notation @xmath103 for @xmath100  a hyperplane in @xmath43,$ ] with the following meaning    * the hyperplane @xmath100 is tessellated by the intersection with @xmath104 and thus split into a number of @xmath20-dimensional polyhedra @xmath105 which could potentially become new facets for the tessellation , were its construction continued .",
    "* we put @xmath106    whenever @xmath107 we define @xmath108 to be the new facet to be added to @xmath4 should a facet birth ( cell split ) occur at @xmath109 on @xmath100 in @xmath110 moreover , we denote by @xmath111 the cell split by the birth of @xmath108 and we write @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the two sub - cells into which @xmath111 divides , lying on the positive and negative sides of @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "+ with this notation , it is easily seen that for a fixed measure @xmath23 , @xmath114 is a pure jump markov process with values in the space of tessellations of @xmath41 and with the property that @xmath115\\lambda(dh)dt,\\ ] ] with @xmath116 $ ] , and @xmath117 } |\\iota(h;y)| \\lambda(dh ) \\right ) dt\\\\     & = & 1 - \\left ( \\sum_{c \\in { \\operatorname{cells}}(y ) } \\lambda([c ] ) \\right ) dt \\label{infineq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath118 standing for the cardinality of @xmath119 indeed , this is because , conditionally on @xmath120 during the period @xmath121 $ ] of the mnw - construction we have , as discussed in subsection [ secstit ] ,    * for each cell @xmath122 the probability that it undergoes a split is @xmath123 ) dt,$ ] moreover the probability that two or more cells split is @xmath124 whence the probability that no split occurs is @xmath125 ) \\right ) dt$ ] as in ( [ infineq2 ] ) . observing that @xmath118 coincides with the number of cells in @xmath4 that @xmath100 intersects , we get in addition @xmath126 ) = \\int_{[w ] } |\\iota(h;y)| \\lambda(dh)$ ] which yields the remaining equality in ( [ infineq2 ] ) .",
