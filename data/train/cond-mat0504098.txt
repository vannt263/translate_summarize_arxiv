    "the interface between a normal - conducting ( n ) , ballistic quantum dot and a superconductor ( s ) gives rise to the coherent scattering of electrons into holes.@xcite this phenomenon , which is of great experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite interest , is generally known as andreev reflection.@xcite a n - s hybrid structure consisting of a superconductor attached to a normal cavity is commonly called an andreev billiard . for a recent and comprehensive review of these systems see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein .",
    "an important quantity for andreev billiards is the density of states ( dos ) which has been studied theoretically by many authors.@xcite its behavior close to the fermi energy depends on the classical dynamics found in the isolated normal conducting cavity : in the integrable case , the dos is proportional to the energy , while for a classically chaotic normal cavity , a minigap ( which is smaller than the bulk superconductor gap @xmath0 ) develops .",
    "moreover , depending on the geometry of the normal cavity one can observe singularities in the dos .",
    "a well - known example of such a behavior of the dos is an andreev billiard formed from a normal metal film attached to a superconductor studied long ago by de  gennes and saint - james.@xcite recently , similar singular features of the dos have been found in other andreev billiards.@xcite    to calculate the dos for andreev billiards many researchers have successfully applied the bohr ",
    "sommerfeld ( bs ) approximation.@xcite it was shown that the dos can be related to the purely geometry - dependent path length distribution @xmath1 which is the classical probability that an electron entering the n region at the n - s interface returns to the interface after a path length @xmath2 .    in the present work ,",
    "we discuss on the one hand quantum and semiclassical results for andreev billiards with walls which are mediating a smooth transition between the interior of the cavity and the region outside . on the other hand , we calculate , for the first time , the wavefunctions of eigenstates in such andreev billiards . as a prototypical example for an andreev billiard confined by soft walls , we choose a parabolic wall profile , as shown in fig .",
    "such soft - walled andreev billiards are of interest because they describe the potential profile found in studies of typical quantum dots realized by remote surface gates.@xcite soft walls are a quite realistic approximation which extends previous theoretical work where infinitely high walls were employed . we demonstrate that with suitable adaptions , the bs approximation can describe n - s hybrid systems in which the electrostatic potential in the normal conducting cavity is modelled by a parabolic potential .",
    "recently , silvestrov et  al .",
    "@xcite have presented a quasiclassical study of andreev billiards containing smoothly varying potentials inside the normal dot . however , no exact quantum mechanical calculation of the energy levels of such andreev billiards has been performed .",
    "we succesfully tested the predictions for the dos obtained from our bs approximation by comparing them to results found from exact quantum mechanical calculations using the bogoliubov - de  gennes ( bdg ) equation .",
    "a better understanding of the bs approximation can be gained by the analysis of electron and hole wavefunctions of andreev states which we determine by the modular recursive green s function method ( mrgm).@xcite based on recent theoretical studies  @xcite the wave function patterns observed in andreev billiards may be scanned by measuring the tunneling conductance of such systems .",
    "we show that the wave functions feature enhanced density over continuous families of classical periodic orbits ( `` bundles''@xcite ) .",
    "these bundles of classical orbits give rise to peaks in the pathlength distribution @xmath1 and , as a consequence , the dos shows singular behavior at certain energies . moreover , a close similarity between the electron and the hole components of the eigenstates is observed in line with the semiclassical picture of the andreev retroreflection process .",

    "the superconducting pairing potential @xmath0 is constant in the s region and zero in the n region .",
    "this approximation is valid if the superconducting coherence length @xmath14 is small compared to the characteristic size of the rectangular cavity.@xcite thus , the pairing potential is given by a step function model @xmath15 , where the coordinate system @xmath16 is chosen such that the n - s interface is located at @xmath17 .",

    "we study the bound states of andreev billiards , i.e.  the eigenenergies @xmath23 are in the range @xmath25 .",
    "the energy levels @xmath26 of the hybrid system are found by matching the wave functions at the n - s interface . to construct the wave functions satisfying the bogoliubov - de gennes equation in the two regions",
    "we follow the methods of beenakker  @xcite and cserti et  al ..  @xcite the wave function in the normal region can be expressed in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath27 of the open system in which the superconductor is replaced by a normal lead .",
    "this scattering matrix is calculated by the modular recursive green s function method developed by rotter et  al .",
    "@xcite note that this method to study andreev billiards is , within the model assumption outlined above , exact .",
    "in particular , it does not rely on the usual andreev approximation,@xcite i.e. , @xmath28 , and the assumption of quasi - particles whose angle of incidence / reflection are approximately perpendicular to the n - s interface.@xcite    the integrated density of states ( in the following called state counting function ) can be obtained from the energy levels @xmath26 as @xmath29 in our numerical calculations discussed below @xmath30 can be obtained directly .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward to compare the state counting functions obtained from the exact quantum mechanical calculations with that from the bs approximation",
    ". the numerical differentiation to determine the dos can thus be by - passed .",
    "we now sketch the method for calculating the wave functions in the two regions . from the matching conditions one can find the expansion coefficients @xmath31 of the wave functions in the s region , and @xmath32 in the n region in terms of the right ( @xmath33 ) and left",

    "note that to ensure the boundary conditions at @xmath41 , only the right ( left ) moving plane waves @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) enter in the expansion of the wave function in the s region .",
    "calculation of the wave function in the normal dot requires two steps . at first we",
    "obtain the wave function at the n - s interface using the expansion coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 calculated from the matching conditions at the n - s interface .",
    "secondly , the wave function inside the dot can be written as    [ u - v : eq ] @xmath46    where the @xmath47 are the scattering wave functions of a particle inside the dot which can be obtained by projecting the retarded green function @xmath48 of the cavity onto the incoming wave:@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . while the wavefunction in the superconductor is given as a sum of analytically determined functions have to be determined numerically . ] in the continuum limit , the wavefunction in the normal conductor is determined numerically on a tight - binding grid . in spite of these two very different approaches",
    ", we were able to fulfill the matching conditions with remarkable accuracy .",
    "the latter is a measure for the degree of convergence of the tight - binding grid calculation towards the continuum limit .      over the last decade ,",

    "subsequently , @xmath2 is transformed to @xmath91 ( eq .  ( [ sprime ] ) ) for each encounter with one of the soft walls .",
    "note that the return probability @xmath88 obtained in this way differs from that calculated from the geometric length of the curved trajectories . the effective path length @xmath91 ( fig .",
    "( [ figpall ] ) ) associated with the action of the particle in the harmonic potential is longer than the geometric length @xmath63 .",
    "the reason for this surprising behavior is that while the individual actions @xmath92 and @xmath93 of the particle and the hole propagating in the parabolic potential are smaller than @xmath94 , with the geometric length @xmath63 and the constant momentum @xmath95 , the difference between the particle and the hole actions @xmath96 is larger than @xmath97 .",
    "in this section we compare the state counting function obtained from the exact numerical quantum calculations with that predicted by the bs approximation presented above .",
    "we consider a ballistic dot confined by ( @xmath3 ) one or ( @xmath4 ) three parabolically shaped potential walls as shown in fig .",
    "moreover , we present both particle as well as hole components of the wavefunction of eigenstates of these n - s hybrid systems .",
    "+    we first consider an n - s system in which the normal dot is confined by one parabolic potential as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](@xmath3 ) .",
    "numerically we have found that most classical trajectories starting from the n - s interface will hit the parabolic wall once , before returning to the superconductor ( see e.g.  the trajectory indicated in fig .",
    "[ figrefl ] ) .",
    "this feature allows us to test our semiclassical approach on a comparatively simple level before proceeding to the more complicated case of three parabolic walls .",
    "we find that the agreement between the exact quantum mechanical calculations for @xmath30 and its semiclassical counterpart @xmath98 is generally very good ( see fig .",
    "[ figvx0.7](@xmath3 ) ) , which proves that our semiclassical approach extended to andreev billiards with soft walls is well suited to describe these systems .",
    "a small discrepancy arises only at excitation energies above the cusp marked ( @xmath4 ) in fig .",
    "[ figvx0.7](@xmath3 ) .",
    "we also note , that both curves show a distinct cusp structure , which has also been found in other andreev billiards .",
    "@xcite these cusps can be understood from the bs approximation as being the consequence of the behavior of the path length distribution @xmath88 at certain path lengths .",
    "for example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figpall ] , @xmath88 has a peak at @xmath99 which results in the most pronounced cusp of the state counting function at @xmath100 , as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ epsqn ] ) .",
    "this cusp , marked ( @xmath4 ) in fig .",
    "[ figvx0.7](@xmath3 ) , corresponds to the shortest classical orbits possible in the system .",
    "the electron leaves perpendicular to the n - s interface , is reflected back at the soft wall , and then reaches the n - s interface again .",
    "such trajectories are similar to the stationary chords found in ref .  .",
    "the corresponding peak in @xmath88 ( also marked as ( @xmath4 ) in fig .",
    "[ figpall ] ) represents a continuous family of trajectories ( or bundles@xcite ) that feature the same topology and bouncing pattern and ( almost ) the same length , but different initial conditions . in this case",
    ", the bundle is generated by a continuous change in the @xmath101 coordinate at the n - s interface .",
    "the corresponding probability density of the wave function in fig .",
    "[ figvx0.7](@xmath4 ) displays a pronounced enhancement along the bundle of classical periodic orbits .",
    "a similar phenomenon has recently been found in pseudointegrable normal billiards  @xcite and was called superscarring .    according to eq .",
    "( [ nbs ] ) , for constant quantum number @xmath102 , smaller excitation energies @xmath103 correspond to longer classical orbits .",
    "this suggests that the excitation energies below the pronounced cusp at @xmath100 correspond to classical orbits with lengths @xmath104 .",
    "indeed , for smaller @xmath103 certain wavefunctions mirror bundles of longer classical orbits .",
    "some examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ figvx0.7](@xmath105 ) , ( see also fig .",
    "[ figpall ] for the correspondig path lenghts ) .",
    "the `` superscarring '' of the corresponding wavefunction near the bundles of short orbits also suggests that the bs approximation reflects the essential features of the underlying quantum dynamics .",
    "+    we now consider the more complicated case of n - s systems in which the normal dot is confined by three soft walls as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](@xmath4 ) .",
    "the agreement between the semiclassical bs approximation ( fig .  [ figvxy](@xmath3 ) ) and the quantum mechanical calculation for the state counting function is again very good .",
    "the position of the cusp in @xmath30 can be predicted by the bs approximation to originate from the bundle of shortest trajectories .",
    "the corresponding peak in @xmath88 ( shown in the lower right inset of fig .",
    "[ figvxy](@xmath3 ) ) is located at @xmath106 resulting in a cusp at @xmath107 .",
    "the wave function of the energy level at the cusp ( see fig .  [ figvxy](@xmath4 ) ) shows a density enhancement over a bundle of classical periodic orbits analogous to the one discussed for the dot with only one soft wall . as the shortest orbits do not explore the upper and lower horizontal walls",
    ", this similarity is to be expected .",
    "[ figvxy](@xmath108 ) presents projections of an andreev state that explores the additional soft walls .",
    "it mirrors in both the particle and hole components a bundle of classical trajectories all bouncing in sequence at all three soft walls . in line with the retracing approximation",
    ", their length @xmath109 is reflected in @xmath88 ( marked as ( @xmath108 ) ) .",
    "the `` width '' of the bundle ( i.e.  the continuous range of initial conditions ) is , however , narrower than the bundle discussed in the previous paragraph , resulting in a strongly reduced slope in @xmath110 .",
    "a very different scenario emerges for the andreev eigenstate depicted in fig .",
    "[ figvxy](@xmath111 ) .",
    "the particle and hole parts display a drastically different pattern pointing to the limitation of the ideal retracing approximation .",
    "while the hole part @xmath112 is characterized by the `` bouncing ball '' type scar of trajectories bouncing at the upper and lower horizontal wall , the electron part @xmath113 shows no distinct enhancements .",
    "furthermore , integrating @xmath114 and @xmath115 over the area of the normal dot we find that the probability of finding the quasiparticle in the hole state is 79% while the probability of the electron state is only 12% ( and altogether 9% of finding the quasiparticle in the superconductor ) . taking into account also that the hole component @xmath116 has a very low amplitude at the n - s interface , one can come to the conclusion that the hole part is only weakly coupled to the superconductor .",
    "the andreev state of fig .",
    "[ figvxy](@xmath111 ) can therefore be quantized by assuming that the particle is quasi - bound in the hole space where it spends most of its time with only infrequent and short excursions into the electron space , where it travels on trajectories scattering off the soft walls before returning to the hole space .",
    "this observation suggests that for certain individual andreev states , semiclassical ebk quantization becomes possible , complementing the bs approximation for the smoothed state counting function .",
    "the almost vanishing density of @xmath117 at the n - s interface allows us to assume that the wave function satisfies hard wall boundary conditions along the left wall of the cavity .",
    "accordingly , the eigenenergies are to leading order determined by the quantized actions in the hole space in analogy to long - lived shape resonances .",
    "the ebk quantization conditions for the `` isolated '' hole state therefore read    @xmath118    [ bs - hardwall : eq ]    where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the linear dimensions of the rectangular region where @xmath121 , while @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the @xmath124 and @xmath101 components of the momentum of the particle . here",
    "@xmath102 and @xmath125 are the quantum numbers characterizing the actions on the tori and @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the maslov indices .",
    "the left hand sides of these two equations describe the classical actions corresponding to the motion of the particle along the @xmath124 ( eq .  ( [ snorm1 ] ) ) and @xmath101 ( eq .  ( [ snorm2 ] ) ) directions .    the maslov index of @xmath128 in ( eq .",
    "( [ snorm1 ] ) ) originates from one reflection at the soft wall and one reflection at the hard wall which replaces the n - s interface , while @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ snorm2 ] ) due to the reflections at the two soft walls . the two equations ( [ bs - hardwall : eq ] )",
    "can be solved for @xmath122 and @xmath123 as functions of the two quantum numbers @xmath130 .",
    "the eigenenergy of the n - s system in ebk quantization is then given by @xmath131 . by inspection of fig .",
    "[ figvxy](@xmath111 ) we find for the hole part of the wave function @xmath132 three maxima along the @xmath124 , and 35 along the @xmath101 direction , respectively .",
    "thus , the two quantum numbers in eq .",
    "( [ bs - hardwall : eq ] ) are to be taken as @xmath133 and @xmath134 , resulting in @xmath135 . the excitation energy of the state shown in fig .",
    "[ figvxy](@xmath111 ) was found to be @xmath136 .",
    "this is a remarkable agreement , given that the mean level spacing @xmath137 of the normal dot in units of @xmath138 is @xmath139 , and taking into account that semiclassical methods usually can not , to the leading order , resolve the energy spectra on much finer scale than the mean level spacing .",
    "the small difference between the energies obtained from the bdg equation and the semiclassical calculation can partly also be attributed to the fact that the wave function at the n - s interface is not exactly zero , i.e. , a weak coupling of the normal cavity to the superconductor is present .",
    "this result implies that the andreev state in fig .",
    "[ figvxy](@xmath111 ) is , to a very good approximation , equivalent to an eigenstate of the hole in an isolated cavity .",
    "a similar effect of the decoupling of the wave function from the superconductor has been observed in a system of a superconducting disk surrounded concentrically by a normal conductor.@xcite in this hybrid system such states were called whispering gallery states .",
