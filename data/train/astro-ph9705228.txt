    "it is commonly accepted that extragalactic jets are intimately linked with accretion process onto supermassive black holes residing in the central regions of active galactic neuclei . these jets are initially relativistic , as indicated by superluminal proper motions of radio emitting knots ( e.g. , wehrle et al .",
    "1992 ) and by high - energy , rapidly variable @xmath0-ray emissions ( e.g. , montigny et al .",
    "moreover , hobble space telescope studies of the base of m87 jet reveal a rotating gas disk apparently lying normal to the jet direction ( ford et al .",
    "1994 ; harms et al .",
    "1994 ) . despite intense study , the underlying formation mechanism is still uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic processes associated with the accretion disk seem to be a promising candidate mechanism .",
    "possible flows of the energy conversion from the accretion to a small fraction of gas in jets have been suggested by shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) in the context of a thick supercritical accretion disk which exhibites inflow along the equator and outflow near to the poles .",
    "if the radiation - supported rotating gas adopts a hydrostatic toroidal configuration , then a pair of funnels are defined which could be responsible for the production of jets along the rotational axis ( lynden - bell 1978 ) .",
    "blandford and payne ( 1982 ) considered a magnetized disk and showed that a gas leaves the disk in a centrifugally driven wind provided that the magnetic field makes an angle of less than @xmath1 with the radius vector at the disk .",
    "furthermore , the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) disturbances produced at a galactic nucleus with a compact nuclear disk would be strongly collimated polewards resulting in jets , if the alfvn velocity in the disk is much higher than its surroundings ( sofue 1980 ) .",
    "such a collimation would lead to an increase in the wave amplitude , resulting in shock waves which are conjectured to develop into a strongly compressed region of the magnetic field . in this region , high - energy particles are likely to be accelerated in the perpendicular direction to the equatorial nuclear disk .    the purpose here is to explore the issue whether mhd waves can convey some portions of accretion energy to the polar regions in the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "causality requires that the mhd inflows should pass through the fast - magnetosonic point and become super - fast - magnetosonic at the horizon .",
    "the investigation of the so - called critical condition that the inflow should pass through this point smoothly offers , in fact , the key to an understanding of mhd interactions in a black hole magnetosphere .",
    "the mhd interactions are expected to work most effectively in the magnetically dominated limit in which the rest - mass energy density of particles is negligible compared with the magnetic energy density . in this limit , the fast - magnetosonic point is located very close to the horizon ( e.g. , phinney 1983 ) ; as a result , a general relativistic treatment is required . analyzing the critical condition in a stationary and axisymmetric magnetically dominated black hole magnetosphere , hirotani et al .",
    "( 1992 , hereafter paper i ) showed that roughly @xmath2 of the rest - mass energy and a significant fraction of the initial angular momentum are transported from the fluid to the magnetic field during the infall .",
    "furthermore , if a small - amplitude perturbation is introduced into the magnetosphere , a lot of perturbation energy is deposited from the magnetic field to the fluid near to the fast - surface in the short - wavelength limit ; accordingly , the plasma accretion becomes highly variable there ( @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "subsequently , hirotani and tomimatsu ( 1994 , paper iii ) investigated the spatial structure of the disturbance in a schwarzschild metric , assuming that the characteristic scale of the radial variations of perturbed quantities is comparable to that of unperturbed quantities instead of adopting the short - wavelength limit .",
    "they revealed that the magnetically dominated accretion becomes most variable at the fast - magnetosonic separatrix surface and that the large - amplitude fluid s disturbance can escape into the sub - fast - magnetosonic regions by propagating meridionally almost along the separatrix . in this paper",
    ", we extend the analysis performed in paper iii to a kerr metric , further examine the propagation of the escaped fast waves in the sub - fast regions , and discuss the possibilities of particle acceleration due to a collimation of such waves .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we formulate non - stationary non - axisymmetric perturbations of the mhd accretion and derive the wave equation describing the perturbation . solving the wave equations ,",
    "we show in  3 that the fluid becomes most variable slightly inside of the fast - surface , which is consistent with the results obtained in paper ii and iii .",
    "we further demonstrate that the disturbances can escape into the sub - fast regions in the form of fast waves by propagating towards the equator provided that the fast - magnetosonic speed , @xmath3 is slower in the polar regions than in the equatorial regions . in  4 ,",
    "the escaped fast waves will be shown to collimate towards the rotational axis under such a distribution of @xmath3 .",
    "we finally discuss the capabilities of such collimated waves in accelerating of particles due to nonlinear interactions between the waves and electron - positron plasmas in  5 .",
    "we will begin by considering basic equations describing a magnetosphere around a rotating black hole .",
    "since the self - gravity of the electromagnetic field and plasma around a black hole is very weak , the background geometry of the magnetosphere is described by the kerr metric ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the mass of a hole . throughout this paper",
    "we use geometrized units such that @xmath10 .    under ideal mhd conditions , since the electric field vanishes in the fluid rest frame , we have @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the electromagnetic field tensor satisfying maxwell equations , @xmath13 } = 0 $ ] and @xmath14 is the fluid four velocity .",
    "the motion of the fluid in the cold limit is governed by the following equations of motion :    @xmath15_{;\\nu }    \\nonumber \\\\    & = & 0 ,   \\label{eq : eq - motion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the semicolon denotes a covariant derivative and @xmath16 the rest - mass of a particle . for electron - proton plasmas @xmath16",
    "refers to a rest - mass of a proton , whereas for electron - positron plasmas @xmath16 refers to that of an electron ( or a positron ) . the proper number density ( @xmath17 ) obeys the continuity equation , @xmath18 .",
    "we adopt these basic equations for a description of stationary and axisymmetric black - hole magnetospheres in  2.1 and for an analysis of perturbed state in  2.2 and afterwards .      from an analysis of the stationary and axisymmetric ideal mhd equations",
    ", it is known that there exist four integration constants that are conserved along each flow line ( e.g. , @xcite ; camenzind 1986a , b ) .",
    "these conserved quantities are the angular velocity of a magnetic field line ( @xmath19 ) , the particle flux per magnetic flux tube ( @xmath20 ) , the total energy ( @xmath21 ) and the total angular momentum ( @xmath22 ) per particle .",
    "they are defined as follows :    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    and    @xmath26    where the toroidal magnetic field ( @xmath27 ) is defined by    @xmath28    @xmath29    when @xmath30 holds , thereby hole s rotational energy and angular momentum are extracted magnetohydrodynamically ( blandford and znajek 1977 ; phinney 1983 ) , both @xmath21 and @xmath22 become negative .",
    "a poloidal flow line is identical with a poloidal magnetic field line , and is given by @xmath31 constant , where @xmath32 is the @xmath33-component of the unperturbed electromagnetic vector potential .",
    "the conserved quantities are functions of @xmath32 alone .",

    "there are two light surfaces .",
    "one is called the outer light surface , which is formed by centrifugal force in the same manner as in pulsar models . the other",
    "is called the inner light surface , which is formed by the gravity of the hole . in a region between the horizon and the inner light surface",
    ", the plasma must stream inwards , while in a region beyond the outer light surface it must stream outwards . a plasma source in which both inflows and outflows start with a low poloidal velocity",
    "is located between these two light surfaces ( nitta et al .",
    "1991 ) ; the injection region ( @xmath34 ) of the accretion may be a pair - creation zone above the disk ( beskin et al .",
    "1992 ; hirotani and okamoto 1997 ) or the disk surface whose inner edge corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit in a kerr geometry . along the magnetic field lines the plasma inflows pass through the alfvn point , the light surface , and the fast magnetosonic point ( @xmath35 ) , successively ; they finally reach the event horizon ( @xmath36 ) . from now on we use the subscripts i , f and h to indicate that the quantities are to be evaluated at @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . in a magnetically dominated magnetosphere ,",

    "all perturbation equations are solved self - consistently , including the trans - field equation .",

    "these results drive us to the question how these fast - waves propagate in the sub - fast regions . in the next section",
    ", we will be concerned with this issue .",
    "as we have seen , meridional wavelength is much less than the radius of curvature near to the fast surface .",
    "it follows that the propagation of wave packets of fast - magnetosonic mode follows the laws of geometric optics . in geometrical optics ,",
    "the nature of the second - order partial differential equations describing the propagation can be well studied by the characteristic hypersurfaces of the system .",
    "the characteristic hypersurfaces , which play the role of wave fronts , can be expressed by a surface of @xmath179 constant , where @xmath180 satisfies the following eikonal equation in the cold limit ( lichnerowicz 1967 ; see also takahashi et al .",
    "1990 for sound waves ) :    @xmath181    where @xmath182 is defined by    @xmath183    @xmath3 is the fast - magnetosonic speed in @xmath184-basis and is defined by    @xmath185    the first term in equation ( [ eq : def - sound - metric ] ) describes the influence of the gravitational field , while the second term that of cold , relativistic magnetohydrodynamic flows . if we were to replace @xmath186 with @xmath187 , we would obtain the dispersion relation for the fast - magnetosonic mode ,    @xmath188    instead of solving the partial differential equation ( [ eq : eikonal - eq ] ) , we can investigate the trajectories of wave packets by solving a set of the following ordinary differential equations :    @xmath189    where @xmath190 is the parameter along a ray path .",
    "since the hamiltonian @xmath191 contains neither @xmath56 nor @xmath33 , both wave frequency @xmath192 and azimuthal wave number @xmath193 are conserved along a ray path .    the unperturbed fluid s velocity field , on which the wave packets propagate , must be solved consistently with the equations of motion .",
    "first , the definition of proper time gives the poloidal wind equation    @xmath194    secondly , combining the unperturbed continuity equation , maxwell equations , and the frozen - in conditions with equations ( [ eq : def - e ] ) and ( [ eq : def - l ] ) , we obtain ( camenzind 1986b )    @xmath195    where the alfv@xmath196nic mach number @xmath197 is defined as    @xmath198    we assume an appropriate functional form for @xmath199 instead of solving the unperturbed trans - field equation .",
    "these three equations , ( [ eq : pol - eq])-([eq : exp - uphi ] ) , together with ( [ eq : def - mach ] ) , give the fluid s velocity field ( @xmath200 , @xmath122 , @xmath201 ) on the poloidal plane .",
    "we assume that the accretion along each radial field line starts from the point at which @xmath120 becomes 0.55 .",
    "this condition defines a nearly spherical ( but somewhat oblate ) injection surface of accretion at @xmath202 for a mildly rotating hole ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "we suppose that there is no flow of plasmas outside of the injection surface .",
    "this assumption alters the propagation of the fast waves negligibly , because plasma flows in the region @xmath204 is non - relativistic , whereas the fast - magnetosonic speed in @xmath205-basis is slightly smaller than that of light .",
    "we further assume that the energy density of the magnetic field is nine times larger than that of the fluid s rest - mass in the sense that @xmath206 .",
    "in this section , we trace the ray paths of the fast - magnetosonic wave packets radiated meridionally with momentum @xmath207 from the fast - magnetosonic surface rather than radiated spherically ( i.e. , in all directions ) , by solving equations ( [ eq : hjeq-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hjeq-2 ] ) in the magnetically dominated accretion described by equations ( [ eq : pol - eq])-([eq : exp - uphi ] ) .",
    "let us first demonstrate typical results when the fast - magnetosonic speed , @xmath3 is slower in polar regions than in equatorial regions .",
    "such a distribution of @xmath3 will be realized when @xmath208 is smaller in the polar regions .",
    "a good example of such a magnetic field was presented by blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) ; they solved the vacuum maxwell equations in a kerr space time and derived a split monopole field , @xmath209 for a distribution of a toroidal surface current density of @xmath210 .",
    "specifically , we assume that @xmath211 in this paper and calculate @xmath3 along a ray path by solving equation ( [ eq : def - ufm ] ) . in this case , @xmath212 becomes larger in the polar regions ; therefore , the distribution of the fast - surface ( paper 1 )    @xmath213    becomes _ prolate_. here , the function @xmath214 is of order of unity and has a weak dependence on @xmath59 as    @xmath215    where @xmath216 is a function of @xmath59 and of order of unity . for radial distribution of field lines",
    ", @xmath217 becomes    @xmath218    the information on the injection point of accretion appears only through @xmath219 .",
    "examples of ray paths of axisymmetric waves ( @xmath138 ) are presented in fig .",
    "all the wave packets are radiated from @xmath220 ( the first quadrant ) in this figure .",
    "even though the wave packets have no angular momenta ( @xmath138 ) , they have non - zero angular velocities because of the space - time dragging and the rotational motion of the accretion flow .",
    "therefore , the ray paths are projected on their instantaneous poloidal plane and are depicted in the figure . since @xmath3 is smaller in higher latitudes , the fast - surface becomes prolate ; thus the waves that propagate towards the equator can escape into the sub - fast regions . as a result ,",
    "the wave packets radiated from the first quadrant propagate clockwise as depicted in this figure .",
    "because of the accretion , waves are pushed backwards to the hole and revolve around it .",
    "the heavy solid line on the equatorial plane denotes a dense disk which possibly resides around an active bole .",
    "if a wave packet collides with the disk , it will be totally absorbed to heat the plasma there .",
    "this figure indicates that _ most of the wave packets _ which are radiated meridionally from the fast - surface , _ collimate into the polar regions where @xmath3 is small_. qualitatively the same results are obtained for non - axisymmetric waves . in fig .",
    "[ figd ] , @xmath221 waves are depicted .",
    "ray paths in the first and the fourth quadrant originate at @xmath222 , whereas those in the second and the third quadrant originate at @xmath223 ( in the second quadrant ) .",
    "wave packets with negative angular momentum ( @xmath224 ) are not drawn , because they are soon swallowed by the hole .",
    "as the figure indicates , non - axisymmetric waves can not reach the rotational axis because of their non - zero angular momenta ; therefore , the tendency of collimation is somewhat weakened compared with @xmath138 modes depicted in fig .",
    "[ figc ] .    in section 6 , we discuss that the collimated waves may experience resonance and mode - convert itself into electromagnetic waves to result in a particle acceleration by non - linear interactions . before we come to this issue",
    ", one more point must be clarified : if @xmath3 are larger in the polar regions than in the equatorial regions , ray paths must be bent towards the equatorial plane .",
    "we examine briefly this case in the next subsection .",
    "we demonstrate here typical results when the fast - magnetosonic speed , @xmath3 , is faster in the polar regions than in the equatorial regions . in this case",
    ", the distribution of the fast - surface becomes oblate .",
    "examples of ray paths for axisymmetric modes ( @xmath138 ) are presented in fig .",
    "all the wave packets are radiated from @xmath220 ( the first quadrant ) in this figure .",
    "since the fast - surface is oblate , the wave packets that propagate initially towards the rotational axis can escape into the sub - fast regions .",
    "therefore , the waves propagate counterclockwise .",
    "this figure indicates that most of the wave packets bent towards the equatorial disk to form a focal ring of radius @xmath225 and do not collimate towards the rotational axis .",
    "for non - axisymmetric waves , this tendency is strengthened because of their non - zero angular momenta .",
    "we have demonstrated that the magnetically dominated plasma accretion becomes highly variable near to the fast surface located close to the horizon and that such fluid s disturbance propagates as a fast - magnetosonic wave and collimates towards the rotational axis ( especially for an axisymmetric mode ) when the fast - magnetosonic speed is slower in the polar regions than in the equatorial regions . in the framework of mhd",
    ", the collimated fast waves will not cause interesting phenomena such as particle acceleration , even in nonlinear regimes .",
    "however , if we take the effects of plasma oscillation and cyclotron motion of particles into account , interesting results such as particle acceleration at a resonant point may be obtained ( holcomb and tajima 1992 ; daniel and tajima 1977 ) .",
    "for this reason , we consider in this section a plasma wave in a pure electron - positron plasma ( for observational and theoretical discussion on the existence of electron - positron plasmas in agn jets , see ghisellini et al .",
    "1992 ; morrison et al . 1992 ; xie et al . 1995 ; reynolds et al .",
    "1996 ) .    as fig .",
    "[ figc ] indicates , wave vectors ( @xmath226 ) of collimated fast waves are nearly parallel to the magnetic field ( @xmath227 ) , of which poloidal components dominate the toroidal one near the rotational axis .",
    "it is , therefore , possible to regard that the collimated waves propagate as shear alfvn waves .",
    "if we would set @xmath231 , we could recover the dispersion relation of an usual alfvn mode , which is identical with that of a fast - magnetosonic mode when @xmath228 in a cold plasma .",
    "exactly speaking , we must take account of geometrical correction due to hole s gravity in the definitions ( [ eq : def - plasma - freq ] ) and ( [ eq : def - cyclo - freq ] ) ; however , at the height where @xmath232 , such effects become negligible .    from the dispersion relation ( [ eq : plasma - waves ] ) , it follows that a shear alfvn mode exists for frequencies less than @xmath233 ( the resonance frequency ) , while an electromagnetic mode exists for frequencies greater than @xmath234 ( the cut - off frequency ) . in a realistic black hole magnetosphere",
    ", @xmath233 is a decreasing functions of distance ( @xmath81 ) from the hole , because @xmath199 decreases with @xmath81 .",
    "it is important to note that the point of cut - off is located slightly outside of the point of resonance in a magnetically dominated magnetosphere ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "therefore , we can depict the following scenario according to @xcite : a shear alfvn wave packet is injected outwards by the mechanism described in the preceding sections . as the wave approaches the point of resonance ( a magnetic beach ) , it increases the amplitude owing to a nonlinear effect .",
    "after reaching the point of resonance , it evanesces through the thin evanescent region to transmit as an electromagnetic wave above the point of cut - off .",
    "when the amplitude of injected shear alfvn wave is high and nonlinear effects become important , the wave may capture many particles to hide the singularity . in this case",
    ", they continue to propagate as an alfvn mode after passing the singularity owing to the so - called self - induced tunneling ( e.g. , mccall , hahn 1969 ) . as a result",
    ", the trapped particles may be accelerated through long distances to become relativistic . according to the nonlinear simulations performed by daniel and tajima ( 1977 ) , who adopted a very thin evanescent layer corresponding to a magnetic dominance of @xmath236 , particle acceleration up to energies of @xmath237",
    "can be realized if the injected wave is highly nonlinear . on these grounds",
    ", it seems reasonable to conclude that the process of wave amplification and collimated demonstrated in this paper triggers initial acceleration of jet due to a cyclotron resonance in an electron - positron plasma .",
