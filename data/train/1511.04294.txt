    "there are four @xmath0 baryon states ( the strange number @xmath7=-3 ) observed from experiments  @xcite . except for the lowest - lying one , @xmath8 , which is well known as a member of the @xmath9 baryon decuplet , the @xmath10 quantum numbers of the other states , namely ,",

    ", the baryons made up of @xmath14 quarks can be classified into energy bands that have the same number @xmath15 of the excitation quanta in the harmonic oscillator potential  @xcite .",
    "each band consists of a number of supermultiplets , specified by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 stands for the irreducible representation of the flavor - spin @xmath18 group , @xmath19 is the total orbital angular momentum , and @xmath20 is the parity of the supermultiplet . for @xmath0 baryons",
    "whose flavor wave functions are totally symmetric , the ground state of @xmath0 baryons should be in the @xmath21 supermultiplet with the quantum number @xmath9 , namely the @xmath8 state .",
    "the states in @xmath22 supermultiplet should have a total spin @xmath23 and a unit of the orbital excitation , such that their @xmath10 quantum number can be either @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "therefore @xmath26 and @xmath27 are expected to approximately degenerate in mass up to a small splitting due to the different spin wave functions .",
    "the @xmath28 @xmath0 baryons should be in either the @xmath29 or @xmath30 multiplets .",
    "therefore the lowest several @xmath0 states should have the energy levels ordered as @xmath2 . on the other hand , for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 multiplets , since they belong to the different @xmath18 representations , their spatial wave functions can be different and can serve as a criterion to distinguish them from each other",
    ".    however , the quark model is not an ab - initio method and can only give qualitative results , so studies from first principles are desired , such as lattice qcd method .",
    "early lattice qcd works can be found in @xcite .",
    "the most recent systematic study with unquenched configurations was carried out in work @xcite where the authors find 11 strangeness -3 states with energies near or below 2.5 gev using sophisticated smearing schemes for operators and variational method for the extraction of energy levels , but have difficulties to distinguish the single @xmath0 states from possible scattering states . in this work ,",
    "we explore the excited states of @xmath0 baryons in the quenched approximation , whose advantage in this topic is that the excited states are free from the contamination of scattering states .",
    "we focus on the several lowest - lying @xmath0 states with @xmath31 .",
    "in addition to their spectrum , we also investigate the bethe - salpeter amplitudes of these states through spatially extended operators , which may shed lights on the internal structure of these @xmath0 states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec .",

    "the interpolating operator for @xmath0 baryons can be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath34-parity operator , @xmath35 are color indices , and @xmath36 means the transpose of the dirac spinor of the strange quark field @xmath37 .",
    "however , @xmath38 has no definite spin and can couple to the @xmath39 and @xmath40 states  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 components of @xmath41 can be disentangled by introducing the following projectors  @xcite @xmath42 in the lattice studies , only the spatial components of @xmath38 are implemented .",
    "if we consider the @xmath0 baryons in their rest frames , the projectors above can be simplified as @xmath43 thus the spin projected operators with the definite spin quantum number can be obtained as @xmath44 furthermore , one can also use the parity projectors @xmath45 to ensure the definite parities of baryons states .",
    "it should be noted that for now all the operators are considered in the continuum case . on a finite lattice ,",
    "the spatial symmetry group @xmath46 breaks down to the octahedral point group @xmath47 , whose irreducible representations corresponding to @xmath40 and @xmath39 are the two - dimensional @xmath48 representation and the four - dimensional @xmath49 representation , respectively .",
    "generally , there exist subduction matrices to project the continuum operators to octahedral point group operators @xcite , say , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the continuum operator with total spin @xmath52 and the third component of spin @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the @xmath55-th component of the octahedral point group operator under irreducible representation @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the subduction matrices",
    ". in our case , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are both unit matrices , so that the operators in eq .",
    "[ irreps ] , which are actully used in this study , are already the irreducible representations of the lattice symmetry group @xmath47 .",

    "these three splitting procedures have been verified to be numerically equivalent , so we make use of the third type , @xmath64 , in the practical study .",
    "these operators are obviously gauge variant , so we carry out the lattice calculation by fixing all the gauge configurations to the coulomb gauge first .",

    "therefore , in order to obtain clear and reliable signals of the ground state from two - point functions in the available early time range , some source techniques are implemented by replacing the local operator @xmath74 by some versions of spatially extended source operators @xmath75 which enhance the contribution of the ground state and suppress that from excited states . the extended source operator @xmath76 is usually realized by calculating the quark propagators through a source vector with a spatial distribution @xmath77",
    ", @xmath78 thus the effective propagator @xmath79 relates to the normal point source propagator @xmath80 as @xmath81 when one calculates a baryon two - point function using the same wick contraction by replacing the point - source propagators with the effective propagators , it is equivalent to using the spatially extended source operator @xmath82 where @xmath83 stands for the original baryon operator ( the color indices and corresponding @xmath84 matrices are omitted for simplicity . note that gauge links should be considered if one requires the gauge invariance of spatially extended operators ) .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath85 between the vacuum and the baryon state @xmath86 , which manifests the coupling of this operator to the state , can be expressed as , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the spinor reflecting the spin of @xmath86 , and @xmath89 is its bethe - salpeter amplitude , which is defined as the corresponding matrix element of the original operator , @xmath90 in order to enhance the coupling @xmath91 and suppress the related coupling of excited states , the essence is to tune the parameters in @xmath77 such that @xmath92 resembles @xmath89 as closely as possible and the overlap integration in eq .",
    "( [ overlap ] ) ( actually summations over the spatial lattice sites ) can be maximized . if the bs amplitudes can be approximately interpreted to be the spatial wave function of a state , the coupling of this operator to excited states can be minimized subsequently according to the orthogonality of the wave functions .",
    "the commonly used source techniques include the gaussian smeared source  @xciteand the wall source in a fixed gauge .",
    "the gaussian smeared source corresponds to the function @xmath93 with @xmath94 a tunable parameter , while the wall source in a fixed gauge is the extreme situation of the gaussian smeared source when @xmath95 .",
    "the gaussian smeared source usually works well for states whose bs amplitude has no radial nodes .",
    "this is similar to the case in the quantum mechanics where a gaussian - like function serves as a good trial wave function of the ground state in solving a bound state problem using the variational method with @xmath96 the variational parameter .    for the case of this work",
    ", we try first the gaussian smeared source for @xmath0 baryons and find it work surely good for @xmath97 .",
    "it is not surprising since the @xmath97 is the ground state whose spatial wave functions is @xmath98 in the standard quark model with a harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "however for other states , especially for @xmath99 , we can not get a good effective mass plateau before the signals are undermined by noise .",
    "similar phenomena are also observed by previous works ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for example ) .",
    "inspired by the quark model description that the @xmath28 decuplet baryons belong to the higher excitation energy bands , we conjecture that the bs amplitude of @xmath99 has radial node(s ) , and thereby propose a new type of source which reflects some node structure , say , @xmath100 where @xmath96 and @xmath101 are parameters to be tuned to give a good effective mass plateau in the early time range .",

    "baryons can be sorted into energy bands of the the two independent oscillators , the so - called @xmath135-oscillator and @xmath136-oscillator , which are depicted by the the radial and orbital quantum numbers @xmath137 and @xmath138  @xcite . for baryons made up of @xmath14 quarks ,",

    "obviously , the local operators correspond to @xmath152 , such that their coupling to the @xmath28 state can be largely suppressed . recalling that the interpolation operator we use for @xmath0 baryons is @xmath64 , which corresponds to @xmath153 and @xmath154 . as such",

    "this can be seen in table  [ wave_fit ] where the parameters @xmath157 deviate substantially from @xmath158 which corresponds to the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "we carry out a lattice study of the spectrum and the bethe - salpeter amplitudes of @xmath0 baryons in the quenched approximation . in the coulomb gauge , we propose a new type of source vectors for the calculation of quark propagators , which is similar in spirit to the conventionally used gaussian smearing source technique , but is oriented to increase the coupling to the states whose bethe - salpeter amplitude may have more complicated nodal behavior than that of the ground state . as for a excited states , either an orbital excitation or a radial excitations , it is expected that their bs amplititude may have radial nodes , so we use source vectors with nodal structures , which resemble the node structure of its bs amplitude .",

    ", we obtain its mass at roughly 2400 - 2500 mev .",
    "furthermore , we also calculate the bs amplitude of the @xmath165 @xmath0 baryon in the coulomb gauge and observe a radial node , which can be qualitatively understood as the reflection of the second order differential of the non - relativistic wave function of @xmath30 baryons .",
    "therefore it is preferable to assign the @xmath165 @xmath0 state we observe to be a member of @xmath30 supermultiplet instead of that of @xmath29 .",
    "we notice that the latest @xmath166 full - qcd lattice calculation has obtained 11 energy levels of the @xmath0 spectrum around and below 2500 mev , but has difficulties in the assignment of their status for the sake of no reliable criterion to distinguish single particle states from the would - be scattering states .",
    "fortunately we are free of this kind of trouble with the quenched approximation , such that the masses we obtain can be taken as those of the _ bare _",
