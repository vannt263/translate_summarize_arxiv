    "the lhc experiments have recently reported the discovery of a new particle , with properties similar to the ones of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , and with a mass of roughly 125 gev @xcite .",
    "this higgs - like particle has been detected in its decay into a pair of photons or massive gauge bosons , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with a rate which is roughly consistent with the one expected in the sm .",
    "the fact that this higgs - like particle is produced via gluon fusion provides indirect evidence of its coupling to top - quarks .",
    "the coupling to other fermions is uncertain , although the recent lhc and tevatron data have provided some evidence of its couplings to bottom - quarks and @xmath7 leptons , at a rate consistent with the sm one  @xcite .",
    "a sm - like higgs boson , with a mass of about 125  gev , provides constraints on the parameters of the sm and its possible extensions . in the sm ,",
    "such a higgs boson mass fixes the low energy value of the quartic coupling of the higgs potential , which is otherwise a free parameter . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , instead",
    ", the effective quartic coupling of the sm - like tree - level higgs potential in the limit of large non - standard higgs boson masses is related to the gauge couplings by the supersymmetric d - terms .",
    "consequently , at tree level , the mass of the sm - like higgs boson is bounded to be below the @xmath8 boson mass , and a large loop correction is needed to achieve a higgs mass of 125 gev .",
    "this large loop correction may be provided by quantum corrections induced by the third generation quarks and their supersymmetric partners .",
    "it has long been established that stop masses of order 1  tev can lead to a sm - like higgs as heavy as 130  gev , provided @xmath3 , the ratio of the two higgs boson vacuum expectation values , is large and the left - right stop mixing parameter @xmath9 is of the order of 2.4  times the average stop mass  @xcite .",
    "values of the sm - like higgs mass of about 125  gev require values of the parameters close to the ones leading to this maximal value , namely moderate to large @xmath3 to maximize the tree - level mass , at least one heavy stop enabling sizable top quark - loop contributions to the renormalization group evolution ( rge ) of the quartic coupling , and a large stop mixing parameter @xmath10 of the order of , or larger than , the heaviest stop mass ( see for example @xcite and related references ) .",
    "interestingly , the current best fit for the rate of the diphoton production channel , proceeding from higgs production and decay , suggests an enhancement over the sm expectation  @xcite , @xmath11_{\\text{best - fit}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{sm}}(pp\\rightarrow h)\\times br_{\\text{sm}}(h\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma ) }   = 1.9 \\pm 0.5 , \\;\\ ;   ( 1.56 \\pm 0.43)\\ ] ] at the atlas ( cms ) experiment ; however , the errors are still too large to claim any significant deviation with respect to the sm . on the other hand ,",
    "the preliminary indications are that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are in better alignment with the sm expectations .",
    "although it is premature to draw any firm conclusion from the present higgs data , it is interesting to consider what would be the consequences of an enhanced diphoton decay rate .",
    "since this rate is induced at the loop level , new weak scale charged particles can induce a modification of this rate , and therefore a lot of effort has been directed towards understanding and incorporating this enhanced diphoton branching ratio ( br ) in weak scale extensions of the sm  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the higgs diphoton decay rate may be induced by particles carrying not only charge but also color .",
    "color charged particles will lead not only to a modification of the higgs diphoton decay rate but also to the main gluon fusion production mode . in the mssm , for instance , a light stop @xmath14 or other colored particles may enhance the higgs diphoton decay br , but they will also simultaneously lower the higgs gluon - fusion production cross section .",
    "this is hard to accommodate in view of the current data@xcite and other theoretical constraints  @xcite .",
    "we shall therefore focus on the scenario that the particles carry no color and there is an enhancement of the higgs diphoton decay br compared with the sm , without any relevant modification of the main gluon fusion and weak boson fusion higgs production rates .",
    "moreover , we shall consider the case in which the main decay modes into massive gauge bosons and bottom quarks remain close to the sm .",
    "in supersymmetric extensions , this is achieved by a sizable value of the non - standard higgs boson mass @xmath15 , of the order of , or larger than , 1  tev . in this paper",
    ", we explore a gauge extension of the mssm that may simultaneously account for the 125 gev sm - like higgs boson and also yield an enhancement of the higgs diphoton decay br .",
    "triplet with @xmath16 coupling to the higgs , in a context without gauge extensions , was explored in @xcite . ]",
    "the model is based on @xcite ( henceforth bdkt ) : the gauge sector is extended to @xmath0 at a high scale ( @xmath17 is asymptotically free and its coupling becomes large at ew scales ) which is spontaneously broken to the sm @xmath1 by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a bidoublet @xmath18 . in the original study , at low energy , the propagator of the residual scalar component of the bidoublet gives an extra effective contribution to the supersymmetric d - term , and consequently an extra contribution to the tree - level higgs mass , as well as to the mass splitting of the isospin components of those scalar fields transforming in a non - trivial way under su(2 )  @xcite .",
    "we investigate a specific aspect of this model that was previously overlooked . in certain regions of the parameter space",
    ", the lightest wino has a predominant component from the second , strongly interacting @xmath17 .",
    "these light charginos couple strongly to the sm - like higgs and may lead to a relevant modification of the higgs diphoton decay br with respect to the sm one .",
    "in the mssm , the enhancement of the diphoton rate mediated by charginos is small due to the weak couplings of the higgs to the charginos . in this case , however , the chargino effects are enhanced by a factor @xmath19 with respect to the ones in the mssm , where @xmath20 is the @xmath17 coupling and @xmath21 is the sm weak coupling .",
    "the coupling @xmath20 can not be arbitrarily large , however , since it would induce a large correction to the higgs mass beyond the d - term modifications .",
    "this is a new , unexplored mechanism for the modification of the higgs mass , which goes beyond the frameworks of non - decoupling d - terms discussed in @xcite , and therefore will remain interesting even in the case that the diphoton enhancement were not present after analyzing the full set of experimental data .",
    "we will explore viable regions of parameter space where this model is consistent with current experimental and theoretical constraints .",

    "the tree - level higgs mass enhancement from the non - decoupling d - term is also accompanied by a potentially large loop correction . as motivated earlier , the diphoton enhancement calls for a light , strongly interacting chargino in our model . as fermions ,",

    "this is generally the viewpoint adopted in non - supersymmetric models . to solve this problem , we need new bosons at some intermediate scale that stabilize the potential via positive contributions to the rge and possible tree - level threshold corrections @xcite .",

    "since the contributions to the higgs diphoton decay rate tend to be maximized for maximal mixing and for the smallest value of the lightest chargino mass , this case therefore corresponds to the maximal value of the diphoton decay br that may be obtained in this model .",

    "[ rgerunning ] , we see that larger values of @xmath20 will result in an increased effective chargino scale . also , in spite of larger values of @xmath20 , the effective coupling of the lightest chargino to the higgs is reduced due to smaller mixing between the higgsino and wino .",
    "for example , for @xmath223 , @xmath224  gev is obtained to generate the proper higgs mass , which leads to a maximum higgs diphoton decay br enhancement of about @xmath225 .",

    "the total contributions to @xmath28 and @xmath166 are small and positive , and remain consistent with the allowed values of these parameters obtained from a fit to the electroweak precision data  @xcite .",
    "we can see that at the corresponding point for maximal higgs diphoton decay br enhancement , @xmath186 , @xmath185 .",
    "as previously emphasized , in our benchmark scenario , we have employed light top squarks with masses of about 550 gev in order to minimize the value of the effective chargino mass @xmath181 .",
    "such light stops enhance the gluon fusion rate by about 10% compared with the sm , and provide an additional enhancement to all higgs production rates in the gluon fusion channel .",
    "larger stop masses will reduce this rate enhancement , but due to their impact on the higgs mass , they will reduce the possibility of having light charginos with strong coupling to the higgs , as is assumed in this work .",
    "therefore , a prediction of this model would be a slight enhancement of the gluon fusion higgs production channels compared to the sm ones .",
    "no such enhancement should be observable in the weak boson fusion channels , apart from the obvious case of the diphoton decay rate , that was analysed in detail in this work .    in the mssm , for @xmath226 ,",
    "the top yukawa coupling is large and in the rge running blows up below the gut scale .",
    "however , in our model , there are additional strong @xmath17 gauge coupling effects that induce a large negative contribution to the top yukawa rge .",
    "using the modified rge evolution of the gauge and yukawa couplings , and taking into account the breaking of @xmath227 in a consistent way @xcite , we have checked that the top yukawa coupling remains perturbative up to the scales of the order of the planck scale .",
    "relaxing the exact condition @xmath228 increases the tree - level contribution to the higgs mass , eq .",
    "( [ treelevelbound ] ) , and therefore reduces the possible chargino contributions to the running of the higgs quartic coupling rge .",
    "the tree - level contribution depends on the value of @xmath118 , which in turn depends on @xmath190 . choosing values of the scalar ( and fermion ) triplet mass to be of the order of the heavy gauge boson masses , @xmath229 , one obtains a value of @xmath230 , while choosing as before large values for these masses leads to @xmath231 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath118 is correlated with @xmath175 .",
    "varying these masses in that range and taking all other parameters to saturate the bounds on the precision electroweak measurements and on the chargino mass of about 103.5  gev , for @xmath232 we can get a maximal higgs diphoton decay branching ratio enhancement of about 42% , while for @xmath233 the maximal enhancement reduces to about 34% .",
    ". also plotted is the mass of the lightest chargino ( green dashed line).,height=268 ]    in the neutralino sector , in addition to the parameters entering in the chargino sector , there is a new parameter , representing the bino soft mass @xmath174 which controls the mixing between the bino , the light higgsino , and the @xmath72 wino states .",
    "if the bino mass @xmath174 is sent to very large values , the lightest chargino becomes degenerate in mass with the lightest neutralino , and the chargino decay width is suppressed .",
    "this suppression may be sufficiently strong to lead to long - lived charginos .",
    "these can generate charged tracks that eventually become missing energy signatures , which are strongly constrained .",
    "this situation may be avoided if the mass splitting is larger than a few hundred mev @xcite and from fig .",
    "[ masssplitting ] , we see that this is easily achieved if @xmath174 is smaller than a few hundred gev .",
    "we also plot the region of negative @xmath174 in fig .",
    "[ masssplitting ] . for small values of @xmath234",
    "the lightest neutralino mass is mostly bino .",
    "the structure around @xmath235 is due to the sign change of the lightest neutralino mass . for sufficiently negative @xmath236 gev ,",
    "the lightest chargino is even lighter than the neutralino , and they are approximately degenerate in mass .",
    "this situation is viable if the lightest chargino decays , for instance in gauge mediation with a gravitino lsp . with this spectrum , in the process @xmath237",
    ", the neutralino can decay to a chargino with a very soft @xmath53 which will escape detection .",
    "although the phase space of this process is suppressed , the competing gravitino decay mode of the neutralino is also suppressed , so the br of its decay into charginos tends to be sizable .",
    "the two light charginos obtained in this process , as well as those directly produced in pairs , give two @xmath53 bosons and a small amount of met .",
    "therefore , charginos contribute to the total inclusive @xmath238 cross section , and as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , may lead to a possible improvement of the agreement between the sm theoretical prediction and the experimental value of the @xmath238 production rate  @xcite .",
    "another constraint for the chargino / neutralino mass spectrum comes from trilepton searches  @xcite , which include the process @xmath239 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 decay leptonically .",
    "small values @xmath240 gev are in tension with atlas chargino search results @xcite .",
    "note that we chose @xmath241  gev and values of @xmath83 such that the lightest chargino mass is close to the lep bound . for @xmath242",
    ", there is a neutralino mass eigenstate that is almost purely higgsino , with mass very close to @xmath241 gev according to our choice of parameters .",
    "this eigenstate will be the second - lightest one if @xmath174 becomes large .",
    "in this paper , we have revisited the @xmath0 gauge extension of the mssm in the context of the recent discovery at the lhc of a 125 gev higgs and measurement of an enhanced higgs diphoton decay rate .",
    "the @xmath22 gauge group is broken to the sm @xmath1 gauge group at tev scale energies , where at higher energies the higgs and the third generation quarks couple only to the strongly coupled @xmath17 gauge interactions .",
    "the model is reviewed in some detail , making emphasis on the possible impact of light charginos and neutralinos on the predicted value of the sm - like higgs mass .",
    "the rge of the effective quartic coupling of the sm - like higgs may receive important contributions from the @xmath17 charginos and neutralinos , and the same charginos can lead to an important modification of the rate of the decay of the higgs into diphotons .",
    "we showed that in order to maximize the effect of the light charginos on the diphoton decay rate of the higgs , the value of @xmath156 , which implies that the higgs mass becomes small at tree - level and is mostly obtained by radiative corrections . in the mssm ,",
    "such large radiative corrections can only be generated by very heavy stops with masses of the order of tens of tev . in this model , however , the chargino effects may be strong enough to lift the higgs mass to the required values even for relatively small values of the third generation squarks .",
    "indeed , the higgs mass puts an upper bound on the possible values of the strong @xmath17 gauge coupling and on the effective chargino mass , and therefore on its effects on the higgs diphoton decay width .",
    "we made a detailed analysis of the precision electroweak constraints on the parameters of this model , which lead to a bound on the heavy gauge boson masses that depend on the precise value of the @xmath23 and @xmath17 couplings .",
    "we also took into account the current experimental bound on the sparticle masses .",
    "after all constraints were taken into account , we showed that an enhancement of the higgs diphoton decay rate of about 61% of the sm value may be obtained in this model , with perturbativity maintained up to scales of the order of the planck scale .    in this work",
    ", we have made specific choices for the masses of the non - standard higgs bosons as well as for the third generation squarks .",
    "we have also not considered the possible chargino two - loop effects on the rge of the higgs quartic coupling .",
    "smaller values of the cp - odd higgs mass @xmath243 lead to a slower rge of the higgs quartic coupling , while due to logarithmic enhancements two - loop chargino effects may vary the higgs mass by amounts of the same order as the one - loop heavy higgs ones .",
