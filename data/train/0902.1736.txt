    "in internet traffic a flow is classically defined as the set of those packets with the same source and destination ip addresses together with the same source and destination port numbers and the same protocol type .",
    "it is well known that if large tcp flows carry the prevalent part of traffic ( in bytes ) , most of flows are small ( in number of packets ) .",
    "a formal definition of `` large '' and `` small '' will be given later in the paper .",
    "as it will be seen , it may depend on the context ; in a first step , the discussion is kept informal .",
    "we investigate in this paper how to characterize the statistical properties of the sizes of large flows ( notably their number of packets ) in internet traffic .",
    "it is commonly observed in the technical literature and in real experiments that the total size ( in packets or bytes ) of such flows has a heavy tailed distribution . in practice , however , this characterization holds only for very large values of the flow size .",
    "consequently , in order to accurately estimate the tail of the size probability distribution , a large number of large flows is necessary . to increase the sample size when empirically estimating probability distribution tails , one is led to increase the length of the observation period .",
    "but the counterpart is that the distribution of the flow size can no more be described in terms of simple probability distributions , of the pareto type for example .",
    "this is due to the fact that traffic is not stationary over long time periods , for instance because of daily variations of interactive services ( video , web , etc . ) .",
    "actually , numerous approaches have been proposed in the technical literature in order to model large flows as well as their superposition properties .",
    "one can roughly classify them in two categories : signal processing models and statistical models . using ideas from signal processing , abry and veitch  @xcite ,",
    "see also feldman  @xcite and crovella and bestravos  @xcite , describe the spectral properties of the time series associated with ip traffic by using wavelets . in this way , a characterization of long range dependence ( the hurst parameter for example ) can be provided .",
    "straight lines in the log - log plot of the power spectrum support some of the `` fractal '' properties of the ip traffic , even if they may simply be due to packet bursts in data flows . see rolland  @xcite .",
    "signal processing tools provide information on aggregated traffic but not on characteristics on individual tcp flows , like the number of packets or their transmission time . for statistical models , a representation with poisson",
    "shot noise processes ( and therefore some independence properties ) has been used to describe the dynamics of ip traffic , see hohn and veitch  @xcite , duffield  @xcite , gong @xcite , barakat @xcite and krunz and makowski  @xcite for example . in ben azzouna",
    "@xcite , loiseau  @xcite and gong @xcite , the distribution of the size of large flows is represented by a pareto distribution , i.e. a probability distribution whose tail decays on a polynomial scale .",
    ",    the starting point of some of these analyses is the need for understanding the relation between the distribution of the number @xmath0 of sampled packets when performing packet sampling and the distribution of the flow size @xmath1 .",
    "the problem can be described as follows : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the problem then consists of finding a distribution @xmath5 maximizing some functional @xmath6 so that the relation @xmath7 holds .",
    "see loiseau  @xcite for an extensive discussion of the current literature where our algorithm is called `` stochastic counting '' .",
    "as it will be seen in the following , we will not rely on the maximum likelihood ratio of distributions in our approach but on estimations of some averages to estimate some key parameters .",

    "it must be emphasized that this characterization in terms of a pareto distribution does not rely on the asymptotic behavior of the tail distribution but only on statistics on some range of values for the sizes of flows .",
    "the advantage of the proposed method is that with a careful procedure , a simple statistical characterization is possible and seems to be quite reliable as shown by our experiments for various sets of traffic traces .",
    "the intuitive reason for considering short time periods is that on such times scales , flows exhibit only one major statistical mode ( typically a pareto behavior ) . in larger time windows , different modes due to the wide variety of flows and non - stationarity in ip traffic",
    "necessarily appear .",
    "( see feldman  @xcite . )",
    "this approach allows us to establish a reliable statistical characterization of flows which is used to infer information from sampled traffic as it will be seen .",
    "the counterpart of that the distribution of the _ total _ size of a large flow ( obtained when considering the complete traffic trace ) can not be obtained directly in this way since the trace is cut into small pieces .",
    "an algorithm is proposed to obtain the statistical representation of large flows when all the packets of the trace are available .",
    "the constants used in our algorithms are explicitly expressed as either universal constants ( independent of traffic ) or constants depending on traffic : length of the observation window , definition of tcp flows referred to as large flows , etc .",
    "the procedure invoked to estimate flow statistics should not depend on some hidden pre - processing of the trace .",
    "our algorithms determine _ on - line _ the constants depending on the traffic .",
    "this is , in our view , one important aspect which is sometimes neglected in the technical literature    [ [ application - to - sampled - traffic ] ] * application to sampled traffic * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the basic motivation for developing a flow characterization method is to infer flow characteristics from sampled data .",
    "this is notably the case for sampling processes such as the 1-out - of-@xmath8 sampling scheme implemented by cisco s netflow @xcite , which greatly degrades information on flows .",
    "what we advocate in this paper is that it is still possible to infer relevant characteristics on flows from sampled data if some characteristics of the flow size can be confidently described by means of a simple pareto distribution . by using the statistical representation",
    "described above , we propose a method of inferring the number of large flows from sampled traffic .",
    "the proposed method relies on a new set of random variables , referred to as observables and computed in successive time intervals with fixed length . specifically , these random variables count the number of flows sampled once , twice or more in the successive observation windows",
    ". the properties of these variables can be obtained through simple characteristics , in particular _",
    "mean values _ of variables instead of _ remote quantiles _ of the tail distribution , which are much more difficult to accurately estimate . by developing a convenient mathematical setting ( poisson approximation methods ) , it is moreover possible to show that quantities related to the observables under consideration are close to poisson random variables with an explicit bound on the error .",
    "this poisson approximation is the key result to estimate the total number of large flows .",

    "a statistical description of large tcp flows is presented in section  [ experiments ] , this representation is tested against five exhaustive sets of traffic traces : three from the france telecom ( ft ) commercial ip network carrying residential adsl traffic and two others from abilene network . an algorithm is developed in this section to compute the characteristics of the pareto distributions describing flows . in section  [ sampledtraffic ] , some assumptions on sampled traffic",
    "are introduced and the observables for describing traffic are defined .",
    "the mathematical properties are analyzed in light of poisson approximation methods in section  [ properties ] .",
    "the results developed in this section are crucial to infer the statistics of an ip traffic from sampled data .",
    "experiments with the five sets of sampled traces used in this paper are presented and discussed in section  [ ssec ] .",
    "some concluding remarks are presented in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "this section is devoted to a statistical study of the size ( the number of packets ) of flows in a limited time window of duration @xmath9 .",
    "the goal of this section is show that a simple statistical representation of the flow size can be obtained for various sets of traffic traces .        for the experiments carried out in the following sections , several sets of traces",
    "will be considered : commercial ip traffic , namely adsl traces from the france telecom ( ft ) ip collect network , and traffic issued from campus networks ( abilene iii traces ) .",
    "their characteristics are given in table  [ traces ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     * remark . * as pointed out by loiseau  @xcite , the determination of @xmath9 is crucial . recall it is determined explicitly by the first step of our algorithm , see table  [ algoo ] .",
    "we have developed in this paper one method of characterizing flows in ip traffic by a few parameters and another one of inferring these parameters from sampled data obtained via deterministic 1-out - of-@xmath8 sampling .",
    "for this purpose , we have made some restrictive assumptions , which are in our opinion essential in order to establish an accurate characterization of flows .",
    "the basic principle we have adopted consists of describing flows in successive observation windows of limited length , which has to satisfy two contradicting requirements . on the one hand , observation windows shall not to be too large in order to preserve a description of flow statistics as simple as possible , for instance their size by means of a simple pareto distribution .    on the other hand , a sufficiently large number of packets has to be present in each observation window in order to be able of computing flow characteristics with sufficient accuracy , in particular the tail of the distribution of the flow size . by assuming that large flows ( elephants ) have a size which is pareto distributed , we have developed an algorithm to determine the optimal observation window length together with the parameters of the pareto distribution .",
    "the location parameter @xmath10 ( see equation  ) leads to a natural division of the total flow population into two sets : those flows with at least @xmath10 packets , referred to as elephants , and those flows with less than @xmath10 packets , called mice .",
    "this method of characterizing flows has been tested against traffic traces from the france telecom and abilene networks carrying completely different types of traffic .    for interpreting sampled data ,",
    "we have made assumptions on the sampling process .",
    "we have specifically supposed that flows are sufficiently interleaved in order to introduce some randomness in the packet selection process ( mixing condition ) and that there are no dominating flows so that there is no bias with regard to the probability of sampling a flow ( negligibility condition ) .",
    "these two assumptions allows us to establish rigorous results for the number of times an elephant is sampled , in particular for the mean values of the random variables @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "of course , when analyzing sampled data , the original flow statistics are not known .",
    "in particular , the length of the observation window necessary to characterize the flow size by means of a unique pareto distribution is unknown . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we have proposed an algorithm to fix the observation window length and the minimal length of elephants .",
    "then , by choosing the index @xmath13 sufficiently large so as to neglect the impact of mice , the theoretical results are used to complete the flow parameter inference .",
    "this method has been tested against the abilene and the france telecom traffic traces and yields satisfactory results .",
