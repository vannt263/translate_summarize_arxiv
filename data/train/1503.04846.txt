    "<S> it was also found that this thermodynamic singularity was accompanied by a sharp drop in the rate of self - diffusion . </S>",

    "<S> , we determine the global symmetry of the configuration , and its axis orientation ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter having been found , we calculated @xmath10 on the reciprocal - space plane @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the axis coordinate ; this result is presented in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the pattern of @xmath10 maxima observed in that @xmath14 plane is distinctively 12-fold . to further demonstrate the 12-fold rotational invariance of the simulated configuration , we also calculated the structure factor in two planes defined by the axis and two translational symmetry vectors , @xmath0 apart , which are indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . the results , shown in fig . 2b , are indeed consistent with the conclusion that the reciprocal - space image of the simulated structure is invariant with respect to @xmath0 rotation .    besides , the two diffraction patterns in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b look like those observed in typical smectic - b crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they represent a structure composed of flat close - packed particle layers axially stacked in @xmath2 order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the diffraction results in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b also make it possible to estimate the ratio of the interlayer spacing and the interparticle distance within a layer as about @xmath15 , which can be compared with the aspect ratio of constituent particles in commonly occurring smectic phases . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this value is is consistent with the ratio of the positions of two minima in the pair potential , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the configuration is structurally similar to the smectic-@xmath1 crystal , except that , in contrast to hexagonal symmetry of the latter , it exhibits 12-fold symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> these diffraction results can be interpreted by assuming that the system s apparent 12-fold axial symmetry is induced by @xmath0 rotation of the @xmath3 and @xmath1 subsystems of layers with respect to each other , in the layer plane . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is supported by the visual inspection of the real - space images of the simulated structure presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . the view from the axial direction , fig . 3a , shows a pattern of 12-particle rings characteristic of dodecagonal structures @xcite , and its particle density lines that can be detected by looking at the grazing angle exhibit @xmath0 rotational invariance . when viewed along the layer plane , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b , the configuration looks like a typical smectic - b crystal with @xmath16 layer stacking ; its only distinction from the latter in that the adjacent @xmath3 and @xmath1 layers are rotated with respect to each other , in the layer plane , by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this can also be seen in fig . 3c .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 we present tiling of the axial projection of two adjacent layers of the quasicrystal . </S>",
    "<S> the tiling is produced by connecting the centres of adjacent apparent 12-particle rings which the pattern is composed of . </S>",
    "<S> besides equilateral triangles and squares , typical for periodic tilings , the present tiling includes the @xmath0 rhombus , an element specific for a 12-fold tiling pattern @xcite .    in crystallographic classification , </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry of this quasicrystal is @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the quasicrystal is composed of stacked layers of @xmath18 nets that each have planar @xmath19 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the stacking along the axis with a @xmath20 relative rotation of the adjacent layers preserve the mirror operations and subsequent layers are related by a @xmath21 screw operation and a diagonal glide reflection with a @xmath22 component . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the screw operation producing this structure results in extinction of some reflections in its diffraction pattern which are characteristic of the diffraction patterns of conventional tetrahedrally close - packed dodecagonal quasicrystals , e.g. those found in intermetallic systems @xcite . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> , it should be mentioned that the diffraction pattern of the present structure , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a , is identical to that of the twinned multidomain fcc structure produced by staking of @xmath23-fold domains alternate @xmath24-rotated in @xmath25 plane @xcite . in this way , the present structure is conceptually similar to the quasicrystalline tgb phases which too give rise to the diffraction patterns that differ significantly from those observed in conventional quasicrystals .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we found a new type of smectic quasicrystaline phase , alternative to the tgb quasicrystals . </S>",
    "<S> the new phase differs from the latter in real - space structure while resembling it in terms of general concept . </S>",
    "<S> the new quasicrystal can possibly be classified as a _ </S>",
    "<S> dodecagonal smectic - b _ phase .    </S>",
    "<S> a conceptually significant peculiarity of the simulated smectic quasicrystal is that it exhibits complete absence of local phason disorder . that the layers are perfectly identical </S>",
    "<S> can be concluded by inspecting the general view of the configuration from the axial direction which is presented in figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature appears to be a generic property of this quasicrystal due to its physical nature , and the way of its layer stacking . due to the strong interaction between particles within a layer induced by the first minimum in the potential , figure 1 , the hexagonal layer structure is solid , making the energy cost for intralayer dynamics forbiddingly high </S>",
    "<S> thus , this quasicrystal structure represents a single energy minimum , which excludes any possibility for energetically degenerate local phason flips@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of phason dynamics , and its respective entropic contribution to the free energy @xciteimplies that the mechanism of thermodynamic stability of this quasicrystal is entirely energetic , which suggests that this structure might be considered as a candidate for the quasiperiodic ground state .    on the other hand , this configuration , constrained by periodic boundary conditions , is a periodic approximant , and the absence of local phason dynamics implies the presence of a uniform phason strain which can be observed both in the diffraction pattern and by inspecting the density lines in the real - space configuration , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a , at a grazing angle . </S>",
    "<S> it arises from the fact that each of the two subsets of 6-fold periodic layers must independently be oriented consistently with the periodic boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the rotation angle between the two can not be exactly @xmath0 , and the deviation is size - dependent .    </S>",
    "<S> two possible ways of materialization of this structure in real physical systems can be conjectured . </S>",
    "<S> first , the morphological similarity of the simulated smectic quasicrystal and the smectic - b crystal strongly suggests that some mesogens of those forming the latter phase may also be able to freeze into a quasiperiodic structure like the one we report here . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these mesogens may also form a liquid - crystal `` dodecatic '' mesophase that was recently suggested @xcite as a dodecagonal counterpart of the 6-fold hexatic mesophase . </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested to possess 12-fold symmetry both in the local positional order and in its global bond - orientational order .    </S>",
    "<S> second , the main features of the spherically - symmetric interparticle potential used in the present model show similarity to the force field predicted for colloidal systems by the classical deryagin - landau - verwey - overbeek theory @xcite ( amended with hard core repulsion or steric repulsion at close to contact ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a possibility that smectic - like layered structures exhibiting dodecagonal symmetry similar to the one reported here can be produced in colloidal systems of spherically shaped particles , with appropriate tuning of the effective potential .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we report a molecular - dynamics simulation demonstrating that a system of identical particles interacting via a spherically - symmetric potential can form a phase morphologically similar to the smectic-@xmath1 crystal but possessing 12-fold symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this is a new kind of smectic quasicrystal , alternative to the quasicrystalline tgb phases which it resembles in terms of the general design principle . </S>",
    "<S> this finding opens a perspective of producing similar quasicrystals in the mesogens that are known to form the smectic - b crystals . </S>",
    "<S> conceptually , it introduces a new formation mechanism of quasiperiodic order . </S>",
    "<S> it also changes the basic model of smectic phases , thereby advancing our understanding of the causes underlying the occurrence of particular structures in the phase transformations of liquid crystals . </S>"
