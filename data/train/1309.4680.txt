    "the experimental discovery of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect @xcite in 1982 has opened the door to a new fascinating state of matter . indeed",
    "the unusual properties of the incompressible quantum fluid that arises in a two dimensional electron gas subjected to a strong magnetic field and at very low temperatures are the signature of an emergent topological state of matter , whose quasiparticle excitations show up fractional charge and statistics @xcite@xcite . as such , it has been proposed that fqh states display a new kind of order , termed topological order @xcite@xcite .",
    "in particular they lack long range correlation and local order parameters but display a weak form of order which is sensitive to the topology of the underlying two dimensional manifold .",
    "further appealing features are a non - abelian berry s phase under modular transformations and a ground state degeneracy depending on the topology of the underlying space , which is robust against any local perturbations .",
    "laughlin states @xcite with @xmath2 and @xmath3 odd are today well understood , both theoretically and experimentally . in order to take into account",
    "more general observed filling factors @xmath4 different from @xmath5 , a hierarchical scheme was introduced @xcite , in which quasiparticles of a @xmath2 state can themselves condense into a new quantized state . in this way it has been possible to construct hall states for any odd denominator filling fraction @xmath4 , whose quasiparticles have fractional charge and abelian fractional statistics .",
    "some years later jain introduced the composite fermions picture @xcite in order to explain more general filling fractions of the form @xmath6 .",
    "the observation of a quantum hall state with an even denominator filling fraction @xcite , @xmath7 , paved the way to the study of states which do not follow the hierarchical picture and then are an exception to the odd denominator rule .",
    "the most promising theoretical candidate for such a state is believed to be the moore - read ( mr ) pfaffian model @xcite , whose anyonic quasiparticles exhibit non abelian braiding statistics .",
    "this last prediction is appealing in view of condensed matter implementations of topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "indeed quantum information is stored in topologically degenerate states with multiple quasiparticles while unitary gate operations are carried out by braiding such quasiparticles and then by reading the corresponding states .",
    "the topological nature of these quasiparticles states makes them robust against any local perturbation . a strong support to the moore - read hypothesis for the @xmath7 state comes from recent experimental data about the charge @xmath8 of localized excitations @xcite , which coincide with previous shot noise @xcite and quasiparticle interference oscillation @xcite results .",
    "further experimental evidence has been gained through the observation of the predicted neutral mode @xcite , also consistent with the mr picture .    at the same time , increasing technological progress in molecular beam epitaxy techniques has led to the ability to produce pairs of closely spaced two - dimensional electron gases . since then",
    "such bilayer quantum hall systems have been widely investigated theoretically as well as experimentally @xcite@xcite .",
    "strong correlations between the electrons in different layers lead to new physical phenomena involving spontaneous interlayer phase coherence with an associated goldstone mode .",
    "in particular a spontaneously broken @xmath9 symmetry @xcite has been discovered and identified and many interesting properties of such systems have been studied : the kosterlitz - thouless transition , the zero resistivity in the counter - current flow , a dc / ac josephson - like effect in interlayer tunneling as well as the presence of a gapless superfluid mode @xcite@xcite . indeed , when tunneling between the layers is weak , the quantum hall bilayer state can be viewed as arising from the condensation of an excitonic superfluid in which an electron in one layer is paired with a hole in the other layer .",
    "the uncertainty principle makes it impossible to tell which layer either component of this composite boson is in .",
    "equivalently the system may be regarded as a ferromagnet in which each electron exists in a coherent superposition of the  pseudospin  eigenstates , which encode the layer degrees of freedom @xcite@xcite .",
    "the phase variable of such a superposition fixes the orientation of the pseudospin magnetic moment and its spatial variations govern the low energy excitations in the system .",
    "so quantum hall bilayers are an interesting realization of the pairing picture at non - standard fillings .",
    "indeed they show up several even denominator states .",
    "the topological nature of quantum hall states makes possible the classification of the different electronic phases of the quantum liquid according to topological invariants , as pioneered by thouless @xcite .",
    "he identified the integer topological invariant characterizing the two dimensional ( @xmath10 ) integer quantum hall state , which gives the hall conductance and characterizes the bloch hamiltonian defined in the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "as a consequence of this topological classification a bulk - boundary correspondence arises , which relates the topological class of the bulk system to the number of gapless chiral edge states on the sample boundary @xcite .",
    "topologically protected zero modes and gapless states can also occur when topological defects are present on the edge of the sample ; recently a generalization of the bulk - boundary correspondence has been introduced as well @xcite , which relates the topological class of the hamiltonian characterizing the defect to the structure of the protected modes associated with the defect .",
    "in this way the crucial role of localized topological defects clearly emerges and that appears to be deeply related to noncommutativity , as we showed in our recent work @xcite@xcite@xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the relevance of @xmath10 cft for the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the analogy between the laughlin - jastrow ( lj ) wave function and the dual amplitudes was exploited .",
    "then the @xmath10 cft formalism was extensively employed in the study of hall fluids at the plateaux , assuming that it can describe successfully the universal topological features of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite@xcite . the key point for the introduction of @xmath10 cft",
    "is the consideration that it is possible to build up a coulomb gas in terms of vertex operators of a @xmath11 cft and then to compute in a natural way topological quantities such as the hall conductance .",
    "that relies strongly on the one - component plasma interpretation of the modulus square of the hall ground state wave function proposed by laughlin @xcite .",
    "furthermore the vertex operator formalism describes very well states with particles carrying an electric as well as a magnetic charge , i. e. dyons .",
    "we also point out that the @xmath10 cft approach to fqhe holds not only on the plane but also on a torus @xcite and in general on a riemann surface with arbitrary genus ; in this way the topological properties of the system can be made very transparent .",
    "indeed the topological nature of the order present in the fqhe at fillings @xmath2 shows up as a @xmath3-fold degeneracy of the ground state wave function .",
    "such a result , as well as the value of the hall conductance , is deeply related @xcite to the algebraic properties of a finite subgroup of the magnetic translation group for a @xmath10 electrons system .",
    "more recently , a particular cft , the one obtained via @xmath0-reduction technique @xcite , has been introduced by our group and applied to the description of a quantum hall fluid ( qhf ) at jain @xcite@xcite as well as paired states fillings @xcite@xcite and in the presence of topological defects @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-reduction technique is based on the simple observation that , for any cft ( mother ) , a class of sub - theories exists , which is parameterized by an integer @xmath0 with the same symmetry but different representations . the resulting theory ( daughter ) ,",
    "called twisted model ( tm ) , has the same algebraic structure but a different central charge @xmath12 .",
    "its application to the physics of the qhf arises by the incompressibility of the hall fluid droplet at the plateaux , which implies its invariance under the @xmath13 algebra at different fillings @xcite , and by the peculiarity of the @xmath0-reduction procedure to provide a daughter cft with the same @xmath13 invariance property of the mother theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath0-reduction furnishes automatically a mapping between different incompressible plateaux of the qhf while the characteristics of the daughter theory is the presence of twisted boundary conditions on the fundamental fields .    but how noncommutativity does arise in the physics of quantum hall regime and how does it fit to our cft description",
    "? really , it comes out in a very natural way as an effective description of the dynamics when the simplest framework is considered , namely the quantum mechanics of the motion of @xmath14 charged particles in two dimensions subjected to a transverse magnetic field ( landau problem)@xcite .",
    "the strong field limit @xmath15 at fixed mass @xmath0 projects the system onto the lowest landau level and , for each particle @xmath16 , the corresponding coordinates ( @xmath17 ) are a pair of canonical variables which satisfy the commutation relations @xmath18 = i\\delta _ { i , j}\\theta $ ] , @xmath19 being the noncommutativity parameter . in this picture",
    "the electron is not a point - like particle and can be localized at best at the scale of the magnetic length @xmath20 .",
    "the same thing happens to the endpoints of an open string attached to a @xmath21-brane embedded in a constant magnetic field @xcite , which is the string theory analogue of the landau problem : the @xmath21-brane worldvolume becomes a noncommutative manifold .",
    "indeed the worldsheet field theory for open strings attached to @xmath21-branes is defined by a @xmath22-model on the string worldsheet @xmath23 with action @xmath24 here @xmath25 are the open string endpoint coordinates , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are local coordinates on the surface @xmath23 , @xmath28 is the intrinsic string length , @xmath29 is the spacetime metric and @xmath30 is the neveu - schwarz two - form which is assumed non - degenerate and can be viewed as a magnetic field on the @xmath21-brane . indeed , when @xmath30 are constant the second term in eq .",
    "( [ mb1 ] ) can be integrated by parts and gives rise to the boundary action : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the coordinate of the boundary @xmath33 of the string world sheet lying on the @xmath21-brane worldvolume and @xmath34 .",
    "such a boundary action formally coincides with the one of the landau problem in a strong field .",
    "now , by taking the seiberg - witten limit @xcite , i. e. by taking @xmath35 while keeping fixed the field @xmath30 , the effective worldsheet field theory reduces to the boundary action ( [ mb2 ] ) and the canonical quantization procedure gives the commutation relations @xmath36",
    "= i\\theta ^{ij}$ ] , @xmath37 on @xmath33 .",
    "summarizing , the quantization of the open string endpoint coordinates @xmath38 induces a noncommutative geometry on the @xmath21-brane worldvolume and the effective low - energy field theory is a noncommutative field theory ( ncft ) @xcite for the massless open string modes .",
    "in such a picture also a tachyon condensation phenomenon can be considered , which introduces the following boundary interaction for the open string : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a general tachyon profile . in general ,",
    "@xmath21-branes in string theory correspond to conformal boundary states , i. e. to conformally invariant boundary conditions of the associated cft .",
    "they are charged and massive objects that interact with other objects in the bulk , for instance through exchange of higher closed string modes . in turn",
    "boundary excitations are described by fields that can be inserted only at points along the boundary , i. e. the boundary fields .",
    "there exists an infinite number of open string modes , which correspond to boundary fields in the associated boundary cft .",
    "in other words tachyonic condensation is a boundary phenomenon and as such it is related to kondo - like effects in condensed matter systems @xcite@xcite . in this case",
    ", the presence of the background @xmath41-field makes the open string states to disappear and that explains the independence on the background @xcite .",
    "the above picture coincides with the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of boundary conformal field theories ( bcft ) .",
    "the authors consider a system of two massless free scalar fields which have a boundary interaction with a periodic potential and furthermore are coupled to each other through a boundary magnetic term , whose expressions coincide with eqs .",
    "( [ mb2 ] ) and ( [ mb3 ] ) . by using a string analogy ,",
    "the boundary magnetic interaction allows for exchange of momentum of the open string moving in an external magnetic field .",
    "indeed it enhances one chirality with respect to the other producing the effect of a rotation together with a scale transformation on the fields and the string parameter plays the role of dissipation .",
    "it is crucial to observe that conformal invariance of the theory is preserved only at special values of the parameters entering the action , the so called `` magic ''  points .",
    "that happens in close analogy with the motion of an electron confined in a plane , subjected to an external magnetic field @xmath41 , normal to the plane , and in the presence of dissipation @xcite .",
    "furthermore we have shown how our @xmath0-reduced theory at paired states fillings describes a dissipative system precisely at the `` magic''points @xcite .    in this way",
    "noncommutativity comes into play and a deep relation emerges between the quantum mechanical and the string and @xmath21-brane description of the quantum hall regime .",
    "now , in order to show how it relates to our cft description of qhf , we start by considering quantum field theories defined on a noncommutative two - torus and then resort to the concept of morita duality @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "such a kind of duality establishes a relation , via a one - to - one correspondence , between representations of two noncommutative algebras and , within the context of gauge theories on noncommutative tori , it can be viewed as a low energy analogue of @xmath42-duality of the underlying string model @xcite : as such , it results a powerful tool in order to establish a correspondence between ncft and well known standard field theories .",
    "indeed , for rational values of the noncommutativity parameter , @xmath43 , one of the theories obtained by using the morita equivalence is a commutative field theory of matrix valued fields with twisted boundary conditions and magnetic flux @xmath44 @xcite ( which , in a string description , behaves as a @xmath41-field modulus ) .",
    "our recent work @xcite@xcite@xcite strongly relies on such an idea .",
    "it aims at building up a general effective theory for qhf which could add further evidence to the relationship between the string theory picture and the condensed matter theory one as well as to the role of noncommutativity in qhf physics .",
    "in particular , we show by means of the morita equivalence that a ncft with @xmath45 or @xmath46 respectively is mapped to a cft on an ordinary space .",
    "we identify such a cft with the @xmath0-reduced cft developed for a qhf at jain @xmath47 @xcite@xcite , as well as paired states fillings @xmath48 @xcite@xcite , whose neutral fields satisfy twisted boundary conditions",
    ". indeed the presence of a @xmath49 twist is the fingerprint of a topological defect @xcite@xcite@xcite localized somewhere on the edge of the system and accounts , in the open string picture , for a mismatch of momentum exchange at its two endpoints . in this way",
    "we give a meaning to the concept of  noncommutative conformal field theory  , as the morita equivalent version of a cft defined on an ordinary space .",
    "the image of morita duality in the ordinary space is given by the @xmath0-reduction technique and the corresponding noncommutative torus lie algebra is naturally realized in terms of generalized magnetic translations ( gmt ) .",
    "that introduces a new relationship between noncommutative spaces and qhf and paves the way for further investigations on the role of noncommutativity in the physics of general strongly correlated many body systems @xcite .    in this chapter",
    "we illustrate such developments and then , as an example of application , we study in detail the physics of a system of two parallel layers of @xmath10 electrons gas in a strong perpendicular magnetic field and interacting with an impurity placed somewhere on the boundary ( quantum hall bilayer ) .",
    "we focus on the case of non standard filling factor , which is relevant both from an experimental point of view and for possible topological quantum computing implementations .",
    "indeed it is described by a @xmath50-reduced cft with @xmath51 and we find that the @xmath52-reduced theory on the two - torus obtained as a morita dual starting from a ncft keeps track of noncommutativity in its structure .",
    "furthermore gmt are a realization of the noncommutative torus lie algebra .",
    "we analyze in detail the presence of a topological defect placed between the layers somewhere on the edges and discuss the relation between different defects and different possible boundary conditions by introducing the corresponding boundary partition function .",
    "a boundary state can be defined in correspondence to each class of defects @xcite and a boundary partition function can be computed which corresponds to a boundary fixed point , e. g. to a different topological sector of the theory on the torus . in this context gmt",
    "are identified with operators which act on the boundary states and realize the transition between fixed points of the boundary flow . in the language of kondo effect @xcite",
    "they behave as boundary condition changing operators .",
    "we introduce general gmt operators as tensor products which act on the qhf and defect space respectively and discuss in detail their behaviour .",
    "then , the emergence of noncommutativity as a consequence of the presence of the topological defect is emphasized and its connection with non - abelian statistics of the quasi - hole excitations fully elucidated .",
    "we find for such excitations a @xmath53 structure , typical of ising anyons @xcite@xcite , while the topological defect supports protected majorana fermion zero modes in close analogy with point defects in topological insulators and superconductors @xcite@xcite .",
    "finally we give some insights on how to build up a topologically protected qubit with a quantum hall bilayer when two localized defects are introduced on the edge @xcite .",
    "the outline of the chapter is the following .    in section 2",
    ", we give a brief account of our theoretical approach , the @xmath0-reduction procedure @xcite , and illustrate how it works in the description of a qhf at jain as well as paired states fillings . in this last case",
    "we discuss explicitly the @xmath51 theory , which corresponds to a quantum hall bilayer in the presence of a localized topological defect .",
    "section 3 is devoted to show how noncommutativity comes into play in our cft description by focusing on the issue of morita equivalence for field theories on noncommutative two - tori .",
    "that allows us to introduce a new relationship between noncommutative spaces and qhf , which is explicitly discussed for jain @xmath47 @xcite@xcite , as well as paired states fillings @xmath48 @xcite@xcite . in this last case",
    "we make explicit reference to the bilayer theory @xmath51 , which will be the subject of our study in the following sections .    in section 4",
    "we focus on the physics of a quantum hall bilayer at paired states fillings because it is the simplest non trivial example on which all the relevant features of our theory can be exploited .",
    "we discuss in detail the different possible boundary interactions of the system and show how it is equivalent to a system of two massless scalar bosons with a magnetic boundary interaction at particular points @xcite .",
    "then the boundary content of our theory is rephrased in terms of boundary partition functions , which are shown to be closed upon action of gmt .",
    "these results allow us to infer the structure of the most general gmt operators .",
    "in section 5 we present and discuss in detail the structure of gmt for quantum hall bilayers as tensor products acting on the qhf and defect space respectively .",
    "in particular we find an interesting relation between noncommutativity and non - abelian statistics of quasihole excitations , as a consequence of the presence of a defect .",
    "finally we briefly sketch a possible implementation of a topologically protected qubit with two localized defects introduced on the edge of the bilayer system .    in section 6 ,",
    "some comments and outlooks of our work are given .",
    "finally , the operator content of our theory , the tm , on the torus for a quantum hall bilayer at paired states fillings is recalled in the appendix .",
    "in this section we briefly review the basics of the @xmath0-reduction procedure on the plane ( genus @xmath54 ) @xcite and then we show how it works , referring to the description of a qhf at jain @xmath47 @xcite@xcite as well as paired states fillings @xmath48 @xcite@xcite .",
    "in general , the @xmath0-reduction technique is based on the simple observation that for any cft ( mother ) exists a class of sub - theories parameterized by an integer @xmath0 with the same symmetry but different representations .",
    "the resulting theory ( daughter ) has the same algebraic structure but a different central charge @xmath12 . in order to obtain the generators of the algebra in the new theory we need to extract the modes which are divided by the integer @xmath0 .",
    "these can be used to reconstruct the primary fields of the daughter cft .",
    "this technique can be generalized and applied to any extended chiral algebra which includes the virasoro one . following this line",
    "one can generate a large class of cfts with the same extended symmetry but with different central extensions .",
    "it can be applied in particular to describe the full class of wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) models with symmetry @xmath55 , obtaining the associated parafermions in a natural way or the incompressible @xmath13 minimal models @xcite with central charge @xmath56 .",
    "indeed the @xmath0-reduction preserves the commutation relations between the algebra generators but modify the central extension ( i.e. the level for the wzw models ) .",
    "in particular this implies that the number of the primary fields gets modified .",
    "the general characteristics of the daughter theory is the presence of twisted boundary conditions ( tbc ) which are induced on the component fields and are the signature of an interaction with a localized topological defect .",
    "it is illuminating to give a geometric interpretation of that in terms of the covering on a @xmath0-sheeted surface or complex curve with branch - cuts , see for instance figs . 1 , 2 for the particular case @xmath51 .",
    "-covered cylinder can be viewed as a separation line of two different domains of the @xmath52-reduced cft . ]    indeed the fields which are defined on the left domain of the boundary have tbc while the fields defined on the right one have periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "when we generalize the construction to a riemann surface of genus @xmath57 , i. e. a torus , we find different sectors corresponding to different boundary conditions on the cylinder , as shown in detail in refs .",
    "finally we recognize the daughter theory as an orbifold of the usual cft describing the qhf at a given plateau .",
    "the physical interpretation of such a construction within the context of a qhf description is the following .",
    "the two sheets simulate a two - layer quantum hall system and the branch cut represents tbc which emerge from the interaction with a localized topological defect on the edge @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "let us now briefly summarize our @xmath0-reduction procedure on the plane @xcite .",
    "the starting point is described by a cft with @xmath11 , in terms of a scalar chiral field compactified on a circle with general radius @xmath58 ( @xmath59 for the jain series @xcite while @xmath60 for the non standard one @xcite , as we will recall in the following ) .",
    "then the @xmath61 current is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the compactified fubini field with the standard mode expansion : @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 satisfy the commutation relations @xmath68",

    "the primary fields are expressed in terms of the vertex operators @xmath70 with @xmath71  ( @xmath72 ) and conformal dimension @xmath73 .    starting with the set of fields in the above cft and using the @xmath0-reduction procedure , which consists in considering the subalgebra generated only by the modes in eq .",
    "( [ modes ] ) , which are multiple of an integer @xmath0 , we get the image of the twisted sector of a @xmath56 orbifold cft ( i. e. the tm ) , which describes the lowest landau level ( lll ) dynamics of the new filling in the qhf context . in this way",
    "the fundamental fields are mapped into @xmath0 twisted fields which are related by a discrete abelian group .",
    "indeed the fields in the mother cft can be factorized into irreducible orbits of the discrete @xmath49 group , which is a symmetry of the tm , and can be organized into components , which have well defined transformation properties under this group . to compare the orbifold so built with the @xmath56 cft",

    "this field describes the @xmath9 electrically charged component of the new filling in a qhf description .    on the other hand",
    "the non - invariant fields defined by @xmath83 naturally satisfy twisted boundary conditions , so that the @xmath84 current of the mother theory decomposes into a charged current given by @xmath85 and @xmath86 neutral ones @xmath87 .",
    "* 2 ) * the @xmath0-reduction applied to the vertex operators @xmath88 of the mother theory also induces twisted boundary conditions on the vertex operators of the daughter cft .",
    "the discrete group used in this case is just the @xmath0-ality group which selects the neutral modes with a complementary cut singularity , which is necessary to reinforce the locality constraint .",
    "the vertex operator in the mother theory can be factorized into a vertex that depends only on the @xmath89 field : @xmath90 and in vertex operators depending on the @xmath91 fields .",
    "it is useful to introduce the neutral component : @xmath92 which is invariant under the twist group given in * 1 ) * and has @xmath0-ality charge @xmath93 .",
    "then , the new primary fields are the composite vertex operators @xmath94 , where @xmath95 are the neutral operators with @xmath0-ality charge @xmath96 .    from these primary fields we can obtain the new virasoro algebra with central charge @xmath56 which is generated by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath97 .",
    "it is the sum of two independent operators , one depending on the charged sector : @xmath98 with @xmath11 and the other given in terms of the @xmath49 twisted bosons @xmath99 : @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",

    "in this subsection we focus on the description of a qhf at jain fillings in terms of vertex operators and review the main results of @xmath0-reduction procedure in order to classify its excitations .",

    "the mr conformal blocks @xmath392 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ mr1])-([mr3 ] ) in the appendix ) depend on the abelian index @xmath287 and the spin index @xmath393 .",
    "the subgroup of gmt which stabilize the mr conformal blocks is realized by the operators which transport symmetric electrons as we will show in the following .",
    "the @xmath9 abelian charge / flux sector is characterized by a definite @xmath394-charge and flux for any type of particles , which simply add together due to the charge and flux conservation .",
    "a phase @xmath395 is generated by winding one particle around another ( i.e. the abelian aharonov - bohm phase factor ) . in the presence of the neutral component",
    "this phase is fairly simple .",
    "we can have a different behaviour depending on the abelian or non - abelian nature of the excitations . in the untwisted sector ( i.e. without @xmath22-fields ) the particles , which are anyons or electrons , all exhibit abelian statistics .",

    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "we also point out that noncommutativity is strictly related to the presence of a topological defect on the edge of the bilayer system , which supports protected majorana fermion zero modes .",
    "that happens in close analogy with point defects in topological insulators and superconductors , where the existence of majorana bound states is related to a @xmath1 topological invariant @xcite .",
    "our theoretical approach is peculiar in that it allows one to give a meaning to the concept of noncommutative conformal field theory , as the morita equivalent version of a cft defined on an ordinary space .",
    "furthermore it helps to shed new light on the relationship between noncommutativity and qhf physics on one hand and between string and @xmath21-brane theory and qhf physics on the other hand @xcite .",
    "recently we employed the @xmath0-reduction procedure in order to describe non trivial phenomenology in different condensed matter systems such as josephson junction ladders and arrays @xcite@xcite@xcite , two - dimensional fully frustrated @xmath473 models @xcite and antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath474 ladders with a variety of interactions @xcite .",
    "so , it could be interesting to investigate the role of noncommutativity in these systems .",
    "here we give the whole primary fields content of our tm on the torus topology at paired state fillings by focusing on the particular case @xmath51 , which describes the physics of a quantum hall bilayer .    on the torus ,",
    "the primary fields are described in terms of the conformal blocks ( or characters ) of the mr and the ising model @xcite .",
    "the mr characters @xmath392 with @xmath475 and @xmath287 ,  are explicitly given by : @xmath476 they represent the field content of the @xmath1 invariant @xmath155  cft @xcite with a charged component ( @xmath477 \\left ( 2\\left ( p+1\\right ) w|4\\left ( p+1\\right ) \\tau \\right ) $ ] ) and a neutral component ( @xmath478 , the conformal blocks of the ising model ) .",
    "the characters of the twisted sector are given by : @xmath479 which do not depend on the parity of @xmath67 ; @xmath480 for @xmath67 even , and @xmath481 for @xmath67 odd .",
    "notice that only the symmetric combinations @xmath482 can be factorized in terms of the @xmath483  and @xmath484 theory .",
    "that is a consequence of the parity selection rule ( @xmath0-ality ) , which gives a gluing condition for the charged and neutral excitations .",
    "furthermore the characters of the untwisted sector are given by : @xmath485 where @xmath486 are the characters of @xmath134 model @xcite : @xmath487 @xmath488  being the characters of the @xmath11 dirac theory .",
    "notice that @xmath489 , so that only for a balanced system the two characters can be identified while @xmath490 .",
    "let us also point out that , as evidenced from eq .",
    "( [ hal1 ] ) , one character of the tm is identified with two characters of the  @xmath134 model . in this way",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state on the torus is reduced from @xmath491 to @xmath492 when switching from @xmath134 to tm , a clear signature of a transition from an abelian statistics to a non - abelian one .",
    "such a transition is due to the presence of two inequivalent majorana fermions together with the breaking of the symmetry which exchanges them . in conclusion , while in the halperin model the fundamental particles are dirac fermions with a well defined layer index , in the tm they are given in terms of symmetric @xmath493 and antisymmetric @xmath494 fields , that is as a superposition of states belonging to different layers .",
    "as such , they behave in a different way under twisted boundary conditions .",
    "we point out that the partition function on the torus can be written as : @xmath495 for @xmath67 even , where : @xmath496 @xmath497 while for p odd we get simply : @xmath498 as recalled above , the two majorana fermions are not completely equivalent and that reflects in the factorization of the partition function in the mr and ising ( non - invariant ) one : @xmath499 where @xmath500 is the modular invariant partition function of the mr @xmath155 theory : @xmath501 and @xmath502 is the partition function of the ising @xmath154 theory : @xmath503                            umanski , v. ; stern , a. ; dolev , m. ; heiblum , m. ; mahalu , d. nature 2008 , 452 , 829 - 834 ; radu , i. p. ; miller , j. b. ; marcus , c. m. ; kastner , m. a. ; pfeiffer , l. n. ; west , k. w. science 2008 , 320 , 899 - 902 ; dolev , m. ; gross , y. ; chung , y. c. ; heiblum , m. ; umanski , v. ; mahalu , d. phys .",
