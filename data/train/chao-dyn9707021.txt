    "the spectrum of chaotic systems was studied extensively in recent years .",
    "most of these studies are in the framework of the gutzwiller trace formula @xcite for the density of states , that holds in the semiclassical limit , and was used successfully to analyze spectral correlations @xcite . the main problem with it s application to the calculation of energy levels , is the fact that the gutzwiller trace formula involves a non - absolutely convergent series .",
    "resummation techniques enable to approximate the infinite sum by a finite one , and to obtain the spectrum in the semiclassical approximation @xcite . for billiards on surfaces of constant negative curvature ,",
    "the density of states is given by the _",
    "exact _ selberg trace formula , that corresponds to the gutzwiller trace formula .",
    "since it is exact , it enables to distinguish between consequences of the semiclassical approximation of the gutzwiller trace formula and those of other approximations , that are usually introduced , like the diagonal approximation or resummation .",
    "exploration of the eigenfunctions followed the studies of the spectrum .",
    "it is important because their properties determine matrix elements which control the nature of important physical phenomena , such as transport , dissociation of molecules , absorption and other physical processes where cross sections are important . since the classical dynamics of many real systems are chaotic , the eigenfunctions of such systems are of special interest . besides the physical motivation to study such eigenfunctions , they are also very interesting as they exhibit some surprising features .",
    "prominent among these are scars , discovered by heller @xcite in numerical calculations .",
    "a scarred eigenfunction describes a state of the hamiltonian of the system , whose probability density is unusually large in a narrow tube around an unstable classical periodic orbit .",
    "this effect was one of the factors that spurred the study of eigenfunctions of chaotic systems , which aimed at finding the explicit role classical periodic orbits play .",
    "another important factor are mathematical theorems @xcite that state that the measure of scarred eigenfunctions ( out of all eigenfunctions ) is zero .    in the present paper ,",
    "an exact formula of eigenfunctions for some billiards on surfaces of constant negative curvature will be derived .",
    "it s main importance is for the understanding of the various approximations that were made in order to obtain the corresponding results in the semiclassical approximation for more realistic model systems .",
    "bogomolny @xcite studied the semiclassical limit of green s function of chaotic systems .",
    "he showed that it has two kinds of contributions , the first being that of `` zero length orbits '' and the second consisting of a sum over all the classical periodic orbits . from this expression he obtained an expression for smoothed eigenfunctions , in which the smoothing is done over a small interval of energy . because of this smoothing the study of individual eigenfunctions was prevented . later berry",
    "@xcite revealed the role periodic orbits play in the semiclassical limit of the spectral wigner function .",
    "this function is closely related to green s function , and is very suitable for semiclassical studies @xcite .",
    "individual eigenfunctions are related to the poles of the spectral wigner function .",
    "agam and fishman @xcite cast the spectral wigner function in a form that reveals it s poles .",
    "they showed that it can be written , in the semiclassical limit , as a ratio between two infinite sums over the classical periodic orbits .",
    "the denominator is the spectral determinant , whose zeros are the eigenenergies .",
    "this enables easy singling out of a specific eigenfunction .",
    "as the sums that appear in the numerator and the denominator were not absolutely convergent , they were treated by a resummation method previously invented by berry and keating @xcite for the spectral determinant .",
    "later on , fishman @xcite showed that as green s function is related to the solution of a fredholm integral equation , it is given exactly by a ratio between two entire functions .",
    "the parameter in which the functions are entire is a book - keeping parameter that counts the number of times a surface of section through the system is crossed by feynman paths .",
    "in addition , fishman showed that invoking the semiclassical approximation , whose leading order arises from points near periodic orbits , agam and fishman s results are obtained .",
    "the term `` scars '' was quantified by agam and fishman @xcite who proposed to study the weight of the eigenfunction in a narrow tube around the classical periodic orbit .",
    "they found , for some model system , that the weight of scars in the eigenfunctions tends to zero in the semiclassical limit of vanishing wavelength .",
    "this decrease is very slow , in agreement with the observation of scars in numerical calculations .    in the present work ,",
    "the diagonal part of green s function of a billiard on a surface of constant negative curvature will be expressed as the ratio : [ ratio0 ] g_e(,)=  , where @xmath1 is the spectral determinant ( the precise meaning of @xmath2 will be elucidated in ) .",
    "exact expressions for @xmath3 and @xmath1 , in terms of classical orbits , will be obtained .",
    "these are similar , in their general structure , to expressions that were obtained in the framework of the semiclassical approximation , supplemented by other plausible approximations .",
    "it provides further evidence for the validity of the approximate formulas that were obtained for realistic systems .",
    "the special chaotic systems that are investigated are billiards that are the primitive cells of lattices on a surface of constant negative curvature .",
    "this surface is called the pseudo - sphere .",
    "the reason for this choice is that the green function of these systems is given exactly in terms of known contributions from classical orbits . in spite of the fact that these systems are chaotic",
    ", an exact expression for the green function can be obtained by the method of images , since the surface is perfectly tiled by images of the billiards .",
    "the exploration of scars is of special interest for billiards on surfaces of constant negative curvature .",
    "rudnick and sarnak @xcite defined scars as eigenfunctions with weight that is divergent in the semiclassical limit .",
    "they proved that for a sub - class of tiling billiards on the pseudo - sphere ( `` arithmetic billiards '' ) there are no scars according to their definition .",
    "this is in agreement with the extrapolation of the semiclassical formula of agam and fishman .",
    "it does not make a clear statement about eigenfunctions for small , but finite , wavelengths .",
    "this issue was studied numerically for tiling billiards on surfaces of constant negative curvature @xcite , and no scars were found . the quest for understanding of the difference between systems",
    "where scars are found and those where they are not was one of the motivations for developing analytical formulas for eigenfunctions for billiards on surfaces of constant negative curvature .    the outline of the paper follows .",
    "in the next two sections , results of previous research are reviewed  - is a brief summary of previous results concerning the semiclassical behaviour of typical chaotic systems .",
    "introduces the pseudo - sphere and tiling billiards on it , which are the specific chaotic systems analyzed in this work . in section the expression for green s function",
    "is obtained .",
    "the exact eigenfunctions densities are it s residues . in order to truncate the infinite series that arise , berry and keating s resummation method @xcite",
    "is used in section to yield a semiclassical approximation to the exact expression . in section some of the resummed expressions are compared to the exact eigenfunctions found numerically . in section , the results of this work are compared with the ones found for general chaotic systems in the semiclassical approximation . the existence of scars is studied in section .",
    "many of the results in the paper rely on the review of balazs and voros @xcite and on the paper of agam and fishman @xcite .",
    "equations in these papers will be referred to as `` bv '' or `` af '' followed by the equation number in the corresponding paper .",
    "the starting point of the discussion is the gutzwiller trace formula , which relates to the density of states of typical chaotic systems to the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system .",
    "this formula is not convenient , as the density of states is a very singular function of energy .",
    "therefore the spectral determinant , whose zeros lie on the spectrum of the hamiltonian , is presented . in the semiclassical approximation the spectral determinant can also be written as an infinite sum over periodic orbits , that is obtained from the gutzwiller series for the density of states . as similar sums",
    "appear many times in this work , berry and keating s method of resumming it to obtain truncated series is outlined .",
    "finally , agam and fishman s results for eigenfunctions of typical chaotic systems are presented .",
    "the resolvent operator is given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian operator .",
    "the retarded green function is the representation of @xmath6 in the coordinate - space basis : @xmath7 and the density of states is related to it s trace : @xmath8\\right\\}{}_{\\big|_{\\eps\\rightarrow0^+ } } ~.\\ ] ] one would like to calculate the spectrum .",
    "very often it is only possible in the leading order of the semiclassical approximation . for integrable systems",
    ", it can be done by the ebk method @xcite , that relies on the existence of @xmath9 `` good '' constants of motion , where @xmath9 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "gutzwiller @xcite studied @xmath10 in the semiclassical limit for systems whose classical dynamics are very chaotic ( hard chaos ) . in the semiclassical limit",
    ", the density of states can be divided into two parts with different analytic properties .",
    "the first of these is a smooth function of energy and the second is an oscillating function of it : @xmath11 the smooth part originates in the the system s short ( non - periodic ) classical orbits , and it s leading order is given by : [ tf ] |(e)~(e - h(*q*,*p*))0  .",
    "the oscillating part arises from the classical periodic orbits , and it s leading order is given by the gutzwiller trace formula @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes summation over all the primitive periodic orbits of the system , @xmath14 denotes a primitive periodic orbit period , @xmath15 it s action , @xmath16 the maslov index associated with it and @xmath17 denotes the monodromy matrix for motion perpendicular to it in it s vicinity in phase space .",
    "as stands it does not converge absolutely , due to the exponential proliferation of primitive periodic orbits with their length , typical of chaotic systems .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to to treat gutzwiller s trace formula further in order to obtain useful expressions .",
    "such a treatment is presented in the next subsection .      for the calculation of the spectrum",
    "it is more convenient to study the spectral determinant .",
    "the semiclassical limit of this function was studied by berry and keating @xcite . in this section",
    "some of their results will be presented .",
    "the regularized spectral determinant is defined by : [ def_delta ] ( e ) = _ a(e , e _ ) ( e - e _ )  , and it is convenient to study because it has zeros on the spectrum of the quantum hamiltonian , instead of the poles the density of states had .",
    "@xmath18 is just a regularizing function @xcite .",
    "berry and keating showed that the spectral determinant is given asymptotically by a dynamical zeta function @xcite ( specializing for simplicity to two dimensions ) : [ delta_prod ] ( e)~b(e)e^-i|n(e)__m=0^\\{1-e^is_-i _  e^-(+m)u _ }  , where @xmath19 is the smooth part of the counting function of eigenenergies , given asymptotically weyl s expansion in powers of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 are the eigenvalues of @xmath17 , and the @xmath21 s are called instability exponents.the double product in can be written as an infinite sum : [ delta_sum ] ( e)~b(e)e^-i|n(e)_c_e^is _  , where @xmath22 denotes the list of composite periodic orbits ordered by length .",
    "in other words : @xmath23 and the coefficients @xmath24 are given by : [ cmu_berry ] c_=_\\{}_(-1)^j_e^-ij _ _",
    "e^-j_(j_-1)u_|_j=1^j_|^-  . suffers from the same convergence problems gutzwiller s trace formula does . in order to treat them berry and keating",
    "introduced the resummation of by analytic continuation from the region of complex @xmath25-plane where it converges .",
    "the method found to be effective made use of a cauchy integral , and the result of the analytic continuation was found to be @xcite : [ delta_summed ] ( e)~2\\{_c_(e)e^-i|n(e)+is _ }  , where : @xmath26 @xmath27 is a free tuning parameter chosen from the range @xmath28 .",
    "this choice ensures that number of composite periodic orbits with actions in the cut - off region of the complementary error function is much smaller than the number of composite periodic orbits with action less than the center of the cut - off as @xmath29 .",
    "the subsequent terms in the asymptotic expansion for @xmath1 , whose leading term is given by , are given by high order derivatives of the complementary error function .",
    "these derivatives are proportional to gaussians centered around the complementary error function cut - off .",
    "one observes that the resummation causes the effective truncation of the problematic sum in .",
    "the center of the cut - off is the composite periodic orbit whose period is half the heisenberg time @xcite : _",
    "^*(e)=|(e )  .",
    "spectral wigner s function is a function whose poles lie on the spectrum of the hamiltonian , and whose residues are closely related to it s eigenstates .",
    "it s semiclassical behaviour was studied by berry @xcite .",
    "then , agam and fishman @xcite showed , that in the semiclassical limit , it can be written as a ratio between two functions given by sums over periodic orbits .",
    "the denominator of the expression they found is the spectral determinant of the previous section .",
    "this allowed them to single out expressions for eigenfunctions .",
    "fishman @xcite were able to put the results of agam and fishman @xcite on a more rigorous footing .",
    "they showed that the exact green function is given by a ratio of two entire functions .",
    "then they managed to show that in the semiclassical limit their result is identical with agam and fishman s result .",
    "the method fishman employed was fredholm s method for the solution of certain integral equations . in this method the exact solution of the integral equation is given by the ratio between two functions .",
    "each of the functions is given by an absolutely convergent series in powers of a transfer operator ( @xmath30 ) in a surface of section of the system .",
    "using a semiclassical expression for @xmath30 , the series then assumes the form of absolutely convergent sums over the classical orbits of the system .",
    "then , using the same approximations used in @xcite , results that concurred completely were obtained .",
    "the expressions found by agam and fishman suffer from the same convergence problems and do .",
    "this problem was solved for denominator by analytic continuation in the @xmath25-plane by berry and keating @xcite , as was mentioned in .",
    "the same treatment was implemented by agam and fishman for the numerator .",
    "once this was done , they could present useful expressions for eigenfunction densities .",
    "the structure of these expressions is reminiscent of gutzwiller s trace formula , for they have a smooth contribution and a periodic orbit contribution . for later reference only the latter contribution will be conveyed here ( af 3.64 ) : [ psi - o - msum ] ^2_po & ~ & _ -^d*p * _ 0  , where @xmath31 is the velocity along the primitive periodic orbit @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the phase space coordinates perpendicular to it , and : [ delta_i_oded ]    the discussion to two dimensions , the argument of the complementary error function includes the function : [ xi_mup_def ] _ , ( , e ) = s_,(e )  -   , and @xmath34 that was defined in .",
    "the coefficients @xmath35 arise from expressing ( af 3.26 ) : @xmath36 as a sum over the composite orbits introduced in : @xmath37 where , @xmath38 @xmath39 denotes the composite action @xmath40 after the contribution of the primitive periodic orbit @xmath32 has been removed . the expression for the @xmath35 given by ( af c.11 )",
    "is identical with : [ cmupm ] c_^(,m )  =  c_-(-1)^j_e^-(j_+1)u_-i(j_+1)__j=0^j_(-1)^je^-m(j+1)u_d_j_-j(e^-u _ )  , where @xmath41 is the coefficient of the composite orbit @xmath42 ( see ) of , and @xmath43 is given by ( af c.2 ) : [ dj ] d_j(x )  =   .",

    "the systems considered in this work are tiling billiards on the pseudo - sphere .",
    "there is extensive mathematical literature concerning these systems .",
    "various aspects of geometry can be found in @xcite , while many of the results about quantum mechanical properties of these systems , to be conveyed in the next subsections , can be found in @xcite .",
    "useful reviews are @xcite    the pseudo - sphere is a surface of constant negative gaussian curvature of @xmath49 . setting @xmath50 ,",
    "all distances are measured in units of @xmath51 .",
    "because the surface is two dimensional , it can be projected onto the the complex plane , so that the two dimensional coordinates are given by complex numbers .",
    "two very useful projections are the poincar disk , in which the surface is projected onto the interior of the unit disk , and the poincar half plane , in which it is projected onto the upper half of the complex plane . in both of this models",
    "the geodesics on the surface turn out to be arcs of circles perpendicular to the boundary of the model .",
    "the invariant measures in both models are : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are disk coordinates , and @xmath54 are half - plane coordinates .",
    "the distance between two points is : @xmath55    there are several kinds of isometries that are going to be encountered in this paper :    1 .   :",
    "these isometries are the analogues of euclidean translations .",
    "they have two fixed points at infinity , which lie on the boundary of both of the poincar models .",
    "any two points on the surface are connected by a unique geodesic .",
    "the unique geodesic that connects these fixed points is called the boost s _ invariant geodesic_. 2 .   : these isometries are the analogues of euclidean rotations .",
    "they have one fixed point which does not lie at infinity .",
    "reflections across the invariant geodesics of boosts .",
    "4 .   : an even boost followed by an inversion through it s invariant geodesic .",
    "one of the important facts about the pseudo - sphere is that the isometries listed above , are given by mbius transformations in the poincar disk and half - plane : =g()=  ad - bc=1 ,  a , b , c , d  , in the case of even boosts and rotations ( in the half - plane ) , and =g()=  ad - bc=-1 ,  a , b , c , d  , for inversions and odd boosts ( in the half - plane ) .",
    "this means that an isometry that is obtained by a sequence of isometries , is the product of the appropriate matrices .",
    "many statements about the invariant geodesics of even and odd boosts are going to be made in the following discussion .",
    "they are usually easier to consider in the half - plane model , because in it the positive real axis is a geodesic , therefore it is always possible to chose coordinates such that it is the invariant geodesic of the boost under consideration . in this frame of reference",
    "the matrix that corresponds to a boost is diagonal : @xmath56    as the curvature is negative , the flow upon the pseudo - sphere is hyperbolic .",
    "this means that adjacent trajectories diverge exponentially fast from each other . in spite of this , motion on the whole surface",
    "is integrable @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , hyperbolic flow on a compact surface is chaotic .",
    "therefore , motion in any compact surface on the pseudo - sphere is assured to be chaotic .",
    "one such choice are tiling billiards",
    ". such billiards are the primitive cells of lattices of geodesics on the pseudo - sphere , as can be seen in",
    ". the word `` billiard '' refers to an enclosure on the pseudo - sphere with any boundary conditions . in this paper",
    "two cases are going to be concentrate upon , namely periodic and dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the situation presented above is very different from the one arising in the euclidean plane . in",
    "that case trajectories diverge only linearly on the whole surface , so that in order to ensure the chaotic nature of the motion complicated boundaries have to be chosen to introduce the necessary exponential divergence .    having a billiard that is a primitive cell of a lattice of geodesics , means that there is an underlaying discrete group of isometries , whose fundamental domain is the primitive cell .",
    "a fundamental domain of such a discrete group is a domain , that under the action of all of the different members of the group tiles the whole surface perfectly .",
    "the simplest group consists of only even boosts ( in addition to the identity ) , the fundamental domain of which is a polygon with periodic boundary conditions . if the fundamental domain is to be a billiard with hard walls , than the group consists of even boosts , odd boosts , reflections and rotations .",
    "an interesting feature of tiling billiards on the pseudo - sphere is that their periodic orbits are closely related to the boosts of the underlying group .",
    "this situation also exists in tiling billiards on the euclidean plane ( with translations instead of boosts ) .",
    "the important difference between these systems is that in the latter case the underlying group is abelian , whereas in the former it is nt .",
    "in addition , on the euclidean plane there are continuous families of periodic orbits , whereas on the pseudo - sphere all periodic orbits are isolated .",
    "consider free motion inside the fundamental domain , the billiard . since the motion is free until the boundary is hit",
    ", it is on geodesics .",
    "once one of the edges is hit the trajectory proceeds according to the boundary conditions .",
    "again , the simplest case is that of periodic boundary conditions , in which the trajectory re - enters from the edge identified with the one it hit , on a new geodesic .",
    "a more mathematically complicated case is the case of reflections , in which the trajectory is reflected specularly and continues on the appropriate geodesic .",
    "there is another way to describe the motion , in which the fact that all the different copies of the billiard , under the discrete group of isometries , tile the whole surface . beginning on a geodesic segment in the billiard and travelling on it with constant velocity , eventually one of the edges is hit .",
    "then , instead of staying in the billiard on a different geodesic , the original geodesic is continued into the billiard copy across the edge .",
    "if the boundary conditions were periodic this copy is identical to the original billiard , and if the edge is a hard wall , the copy s orientation is reversed with respect to the original billiard , since it is obtained by reflection .",
    "now , the next segment of the trajectory is on the original geodesic , but in a different copy of the billiard .",
    "all this process will have to be repeated once another edge is hit . continuing the construction _",
    "ad infinitum _ , the trajectory is described by the collection of the different copies of the billiard through which the original geodesic passes .",
    "recapitulating , instead of describing the classical trajectory in the usual way , as a collection of geodesic segments , all of which lay inside a limited area of the surface , it can be described with one geodesic that enters and exits copies of the original billiard .",
    "the above procedure is standard practice in polygonal billiards ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the next step s presentation is due to bogomolny @xcite :    1 .",
    "consider one of the geodesics described above , that enters and exits many tiles of the tessellation ; 2 .",
    "each tile along it is labeled by the group isometry with which it was obtained from the fundamental domain : @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the first segment , the one in the original copy ) ; 3 .   to reconstruct the  physical ",
    "trajectory , the geodesic must be folded back into the original fundamental domain .",
    "this is done by copying each geodesic segment by the isometry inverse to the one that created the copy it is in .",
    "these isometries are : @xmath59 ; 4 .   after this operation",
    "most of the geodesic segments will be dispersed around in a complicated manner .",
    "but , for special trajectories , one of the segments ( the one that was in the copy that was suggestively labeled @xmath60 ) will match the first segment _ exactly _ in location _ and _ in orientation . in this way : + _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ an isometry that copies a geodesic segment onto a segment with identical orientation of the same geodesic has been found . therefore :    1 .",
    "the geodesic segments constitute a periodic orbit ; 2 .",
    "this geodesic is the invariant geodesic of @xmath60 ; 3 .   on the pseudo - sphere",
    "@xmath60 has to be a boost , for it has an invariant geodesic .",
    "( it ca nt be a pure reflection because the orientation is the same . )",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the arguments given here are applicable to tiling billiards on the plane too , where the role of the boosts is taken by simple translations .",
    "the qualitative difference is that on the plane , periodic orbits are not isolated , whereas on the pseudo - sphere they are , due to the exponential divergence of close trajectories .",
    "the distance a point is transfered by a boost is closely related to the it s distance from the boost s invariant geodesic . if @xmath61 is an even boost @xcite : [ beardoneven ] =  , where @xmath62 is the distance of a point from it s image under @xmath61 , and @xmath63 is the distance of the point @xmath64 from the invariant geodesic of @xmath61 measured along a perpendicular geodesic ( see ) .",
    "a similar relation can easily be obtained for odd boosts : [ beardonodd ] =   .",
    "the green function is calculated exactly by the method of images , from the free green function , by virtue of the underlying discrete group of isometries . in half - plane",
    "coordinates , schrdinger s equation reads @xcite : @xmath65 distance is measured in units of @xmath51 , and from this point on , energy will be measured in units of @xmath66 so that = if @xmath67 then @xmath68 . in these units , it turns out that the free retarded green function is given by @xcite : @xmath69 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 $ ] is legendre s function of the second kind .",
    "the billiards under consideration are the fundamental domains of groups of isometries .",
    "therefore , all the copies of the billiard tile the surface perfectly .",
    "in addition , as all the copies are identical , a solution of schrdinger s equation in one , solves it in all the other tiles , but for a coordinate transformation .",
    "this means that green s function has to be invariant under the action of the group isometries ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "a simple way to obtain such a function is to use the method of images and free green s function : @xmath73 where @xmath74 ( @xmath75 is the choice for neumann and periodic boundary conditions and @xmath76 for the dirichlet case ) .    now",
    "exact _ retarded green function for fundamental domain billiards can be written using : @xmath77 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has an intuitive explanation .",
    "it gives the green function between @xmath64 and @xmath78 as a sum over all the classical orbits between them . to see this one should describe a complicated orbit between these two points using the scheme described already in the previous subsection .",
    "the distance between @xmath64 and one of the copies @xmath79 is measured along the unique geodesic that connects them . as @xmath79 is completely equivalent to @xmath78 ,",
    "this geodesic is an ( unfolded ) classical orbit between @xmath64 and @xmath78 .",
    "this is fundamentally different from other quantum mechanical problems , where all feynman paths are required for the calculation of green s function .",
    "this property , that holds when tiling is possible , makes the semiclassical approximation exact for the problems studied here .",
    "the sum over the group members of can be arranged in a suggestive manner .",
    "any group can be divided into _",
    "conjugacy classes _ @xcite .",
    "a conjugacy class is defined as the collection of all different group members that are similar to one another .",

    "a measure of the quality of an approximation of the function @xmath206 by @xmath207 is given by the average squares deviation : [ diff ]  , where in this case @xmath208 , and the integral is taken along the cut ( see ) .",

    "the cut - off region extends all the way from @xmath211 to @xmath212 for the ground - state and to @xmath213 for the first excited state .",
    "this means that almost all the periodic orbits that contribute , in both cases , to the eigenfunction density are from the cut - off region .",
    "therefore , one can not expect that the truncated sums in and should do too well , because in deriving them , terms of the same order were neglected , namely terms supported by the cut - off region exclusively .",
    "for such low levels it is essential to include high order corrections to the truncated sums , and although it is possible to do so in an obvious manner , it was not done to date .",
    "one observes that the structure of the resummed formula for the periodic orbit contribution to eigenfunctions obtained in the present work , and the analogous expression agam and fishman @xcite obtained is very similar .",
    "therefore , it is illuminating to compare the two , because the methods of derivation differ qualitatively .",
    "first , the expression agam and fishman obtained in terms of the quantities that apply for tiling billiards with periodic boundary conditions on the pseudo - sphere will be presented . for this purpose ,",
    "the quantities identified in , [ changes2 ] and the following , are required :    1 .   @xmath214 ; 2 .   from and the monodromy matrix for billiards with periodic boundary conditions ( see eq .  42 in @xcite ) :",

    "we turn now to write the result , obtained in this work , in a form that can be compared with . the asymptotic expansion that led to was obtained after it was argued that the leading order contribution was from a small region around periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "therefore , the relevant part of in such a region should be found .",
    "it is easy to see that what remains of @xmath219 is the sum over the isometries whose invariant geodesics constitute the actual trajectory in the billiard , because images of periodic orbits lie outside of the billiard , and therefore there are no points in their close vicinity .",

    "the above comparison brings to light what is missing in the result of agam and fishman @xcite .",
    "their analysis was based on an expansion around periodic orbits , while in the derivation of here , there was no such assumption . in particular , includes the contribution of _ images _ of periodic orbits , which one would never expect to obtain from an expansion around periodic orbits , because these images tend to lie far away from points in the billiard .",
    "the expression obtained near periodic orbits reveals the role of periodic orbits in the eigenfunction density . as the distance from a periodic orbit",
    "is increased , fringes occur , that oscillate on a scale of @xmath222 , and as @xmath223 they are washed out , as a result of contributions of various orbits . as in typical chaotic systems , one observes that the leading contribution should arise from points in the close vicinity of periodic orbits . from this analysis an analogy with typical chaotic systems can be drawn .",
    "as the structure of the formulae in those systems is the same , it can be expected that for some eigenfunctions only a small number of periodic orbits would contribute appreciably .",
    "of - course this can not be the common case , since usually many periodic orbits contribute , giving rise to elaborate interference patterns .",
    "but , for the few eigenfunctions for which this is not the case , scars should be prominent .",
    "the question of the existence of scars in the systems studied here is addressed in the next section .",
    "in this section , the possibility of finding scars , as usually understood by physicists , namely eigenfunctions that are appreciably large on unstable periodic orbits , will be explored the starting point are analytic calculations similar to those of @xcite , for a billiard with periodic boundary conditions . then , corresponding results are studied for a hard wall billiard .",
    "finally these are tested numerically .",
    "scarring of a wavefunction in a quantum system , means that the corresponding probability density is considerably larger than average near some unstable periodic orbit of the corresponding classical chaotic system .",
    "agam and fishman @xcite suggested to quantify this concept and proposed to test whether an eigenfunction is scarred or not .",
    "they defined @xmath224 as the amount of wavefunction density in a narrow tube in phase space , with a large enough cross section around the orbit @xmath32 , in excess of the mean value .",
    "the term `` large enough '' means that the tube has to be wide enough on the scale of oscillations as the distance from the periodic orbit is increased ( governed by @xmath0 )",
    ". this tube can not be too wide on the classical length scale if it is to encompass one short periodic orbit only . using the semiclassical approximation for eigenfunctions ( after the integral over the momentum coordinates is performed ) ,",
    "the `` scar weight '' is given by ( see af 5.4 ) : [ crittube ] y_(e_)=_tube_d()^2_po  , where @xmath225 is the contribution of the periodic orbits to the eigenfunction density .",
    "eigenfunctions are normalized , therefore , if the number obtained is large ( on a scale of @xmath226 ) when compared to integrals over tubes around other periodic orbits , then a considerable fraction of the eigenfunction density lies in this tube and the eigenfunction should be scarred .",
    "if , on the other hand , the number is small , the eigenfunction should not be scarred .",
    "agam and fishman tested this criterion for a truncated hyperbola billiard .",
    "the effect of taking the narrow tube around the periodic orbit @xmath60 is to remove from all elements with large @xmath227 s .",
    "there are two types of such elements : images of @xmath60 , all other periodic orbits ( and their images ) .",
    "this means that the tube removes from all of the contributions that do not appear in .",
    "therefore , the analytic results derived here concur with those of agam and fishman @xcite completely .",
    "namely , if the tube is narrow enough , then the contributions from periodic orbits other than @xmath60 would generally be negligible .",
    "the reason is that , because periodic orbits other than @xmath60 typically have large @xmath227 , the phases in ( as can be seen clearly in ) oscillate wildly . on the other hand , there is a narrow region around @xmath60 in which @xmath227 is very small , so that the phase in is stationary , and therefore @xmath60 is dominant .    instead of integrating over a complicated tube that encompasses many segments of geodesics in the billiard",
    ", the symmetry of the eigenfunction may be used to simplify it .",
    "since the eigenfunction is invariant to group isometries it is the same in all the tiles obtained by them .",
    "therefore , a tube of length @xmath146 that extends from the billiard into nearby tiles may be constructed , just like one constructs a periodic orbit , in the following manner :    1 .",
    "construct a tube around one of the periodic orbit segments in the billiard ; 2 .",
    "continue the construction into the next tile the segment continues into ; 3 .   repeat this process in all the copies the orbit visits during one period .    therefore , restricting the integration to a narrow tube surrounding the invariant geodesic of @xmath60 picks out of the contribution of two transformations , @xmath60 and @xmath87 , provided that the tube is narrow enough .",
    "the reason for this is the behaviour of the function @xmath228 of ( here @xmath229 stands for any primitive element from the group ) far away from invariant geodesic of @xmath230 .",
    "this function involves a phase that causes it to oscillate wildly during the integration over the width of the tube . only for the invariant geodesic of @xmath60 ( namely for the group elements @xmath60 and @xmath87 )",
    "can this phase be stationary throughout the length of the tube .",
    "this means that the contribution of @xmath60 and @xmath87 is dominant .",
    "this argument is , of - course , the same argument for typical chaotic systems that agam and fishman @xcite used .    the resulting scar weight : @xmath231 where @xmath60 is the isometry whose invariant geodesic was chosen as the axis of the tube , and @xmath58 is the identity .",
    "the factor 2 arises because the contribution of @xmath87 is exactly equal to that of @xmath60 .",
    "it is always possible to use isometries to transform to coordinates in which @xmath60 is diagonal . in such coordinates the invariant geodesic of @xmath60 is the positive imaginary axis in the poincar half - plane .",
    "another isometric coordinate transformation may also be performed , so that the invariant geodesic section under consideration extends from @xmath226 to @xmath232 .",
    "now reads : @xmath233\\bigg\\ } ~ , \\eeqa where $ w$ is the width of the tube assumed narrow enough to capture only one periodic orbit .",
    "note , that a tube around a geodesic is defined as the geometrical location of all points of constant perpendicular distance ( $ d^{\\perp}$ ) from it .   in the coordinates in which $ p$ is diagonal ,",
    "$ { \\cosh^{2}{d^{\\perp}_{p}(\\zeta)}}$ is very simple ( see \\fig{fig_perp } ) : \\beq \\label{perp_dist }      { \\cosh^{2}{d^{\\perp}_{p}(\\zeta)}}=\\cosh^2{d_{\\zeta , i\\abs{\\zeta}}}=1+\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right)^2 \\eeq and depends only on the variable : \\beq x^2=\\frac{x^2}{y^2}~. \\eeq due to \\eq{beardoneven } , $ \\cosh{d_{p^{j+1}}\\left(\\zeta\\right)}$ depends only on this variable too .",
    "( this result is correct for odd boosts too , due to \\eq{beardonodd}. )     as the tube is very narrow one may use the approximations \\eq{qapprox } and \\eq{dperpapprox}.   changing variables $ x\\rightarrow x=\\frac{x}{y}$ one obtains : \\beqa\\label{inti } { \\cal i}_{\\mu , j } ( k)&\\sim & \\frac{l_p}{\\sqrt{\\sinh{(j+1)l_p } } } \\int_{-\\sqrt{\\cosh{w}-1}}^{\\sqrt{\\cosh{w}-1 } } dx   \\bigg\\{e^{ik\\tanh\\left(\\frac{j+1}{2}l_p\\right)x^2 } \\times\\lf&&\\times \\erfc\\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2q^2(k , k)}}\\left(l_{\\mu , p}-\\frac{k{\\cal a}}2+x^2\\right)\\right]\\bigg\\ } \\as{k}\\infty~. \\eeqa the integrand of \\eq{inti } contains an exponent with a rapidly changing phase , so the method of stationary phase may be used . since most of the contribution to such   integrals comes from an exponentially narrow region around $ x=0 $ ,",
    "then if the tube was wide enough on the oscillations ' scale ( $ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}$ ) , the integration limits may be taken as $ \\pm\\infty$ without introducing a large error .",
    "in addition ,   the complementary error function hardly changes in the contributing region , so one may approximate it by it 's value at $ x=0 $ , \\ie on the the periodic orbit .",

    "using the fact that the eigenfunction is normalized , obtaining is straight forward .",
    "the general features of the scar weight , @xmath224 , on various periodic orbits for the eigenenergies as presented in agree with the general features found in @xcite .",
    "prominent among these is that the local maxima tend to be located at eigenenergies close to energies that admit standing waves , given by .    the main difference between and the figures presented in @xcite , is that it seems that the functions found in the present work are not as smooth as in the previous work . as a result of this , it is difficult to find an eigenenergy for which @xmath224 is negligible for all @xmath32 s but for a few , because the scar weights of various periodic orbit fluctuate strongly .",
    "the reason for the erraticness is not clear at this stage . as a result , it is difficult to implement agam and fishman s criterion for scars here .    in order for an eigenfunction to be scarred it must have a pronounced contribution from only a few periodic orbits",
    ". therefore the scarred eigenfunctions should be the ones for which the scar criterion is appreciable on one or two periodic orbits only .",
    "agam and fishman @xcite found this to be in very good agreement with the features observed in the eigenfunction densities they calculated numerically , for a truncated hyperbola billiard .",
    "in addition to this , one must bear in mind that in order for a scar to be prominent it must be concentrated in a narrow tube around a periodic orbit , where `` narrow '' means narrow with respect to relevant classical linear dimensions in the billiard ( for example , the distance between short periodic orbits ) .",
    "the width of the tube in which one may expect to see a scar is given by the scale on which the oscillations , as a function of the distance from the periodic orbit , occur . according to",
    ", this scale is approximately given by : l_osc  .",
    "the highest energy for which the results here were trustworthy ( from the numerical calculation of @xmath1 ) was approximately e_5000  , that corresponds to l_osc0.12  . for comparison ,",
    "the distance between the point the shortest periodic orbit hits the side @xmath243 and the point on that side where the second shortest periodic orbit hits , is @xmath244 ( see ) .",
    "this means that even at the highest eigenenergy for which the scar criterion could be applied with any reliability , within our numerical limitations , the tube where one expects to see scars is too wide for resolving individual periodic orbits .",
    "nevertheless , a numerical search for scars was initiated .",
    "there are two ways to go about such a search .",
    "the first , which yielded good results in the past @xcite , is to try to use the scar weight graphs ( see ) to predict whether or not a prominent scar exists in some eigenfunction",
    ". the second method will be described below .",
    "the first was used here , without decisive results . when comparing the predictions with the figures of the numerically found eigenfunctions ,",
    "sometimes scar - like features were observed where they were expected and sometimes they were not .",
    "some figures of eigenfunction densities are presented in and . in principle",
    "these figures are slightly misleading , because the metric is not constant .",
    "but , as the billiard is not very extended , as can be seen in and [ figshorts ] , the aberration is not large , because : d&=&= 4(1+o[r^2])rdrd  . as the shortest periodic orbits lie in a region with @xmath245 approximately , the deviation of the invariant measure from the euclidean invariant measure is negligible .",
    "for example , according to eigenfunction # @xmath246 should be scarred along the second shortest periodic orbit , while eigenfunction # @xmath247 and eigenfunction # @xmath248 should be scarred along the fourth shortest periodic orbit . in one",
    "can see that indeed there are some high peaks of these eigenfunctions along the said periodic orbits .",
    "on the other hand , according to , eigenfunction # @xmath249 should not be very scarred along the fourth shortest periodic orbit . , while in one can see that it does have some high peaks along that periodic orbit .",
    "another example is eigenfunction # @xmath250 which , according to , should have exhibited a scar along the shortest periodic orbit and does not , as can be seen in . in the same figure",
    "one can see that the next level , # @xmath251 , does show a scar on that periodic orbit , as the scar criterion predicts .    at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning that the scars observed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite tended to be more pronounced than the scar - like features observed in the present work .",
    "one may also choose an opposite strategy in order to check the viability of the scar criterion .",
    "this strategy is faulty , as will be explained shortly . in this method one",
    "looks for scar - like features in eigenfunctions , and then checks the scar criterion graphs for a correspondence .",
    "there were several discrepancies , one of which was mentioned above , namely eigenfunction # @xmath249 ( see ) which has a prominent scar - like feature on part of the fourth shortest periodic orbit .",
    "this strategy is misleading because there are many complicated structures in high energy eigenfunctions in a billiard , as they are the result of an elaborate diffraction pattern .",
    "this means that a scar - like structure may have nothing to do with a periodic orbit , as it may be just an accidental pattern .",
    "the first strategy , described above , filtered out some of these scar look - alikes automatically , because a large scar weight indicates that the structure observed may be related to a periodic orbit .",
    "the reason why one expects scars in the first place , despite claims to the contrary @xcite , is based on the observation that many features of the special class of systems under study here are similar to those of typical chaotic systems ( for example ) . since agam and",
    "fishman @xcite found scars in eigenfunctions whose energy admitted standing waves , one is led to expect the same here . as many prominent scars were not found in the system under numerical study , although the scar weight graphs suggest that scars should be present where standing waves occur , there may be important differences between the systems studied here and typical ones .",
    "an important difference that may be the cause for the scarcity of scars in the eigenfunctions examined is the very high topological entropy of billiards on the pseudo - sphere .",
    "for example , in the hyperbola billiard , a derivative of which agam and fishman @xcite used , the number of periodic orbits up to length @xmath9 is @xcite : n(d)~  .",
    "this is much less than in tiling billiards on the pseudo - sphere , as can be seen in .",
    "this leads to the following consequences :    1 .",
    "it is difficult to find all the primitive periodic orbits up to some length ; 2 .",
    "the periodic orbits are denser than in the typical case , so shorter wavelengths may be required to observe scars clearly .",
    "evidently , it would have been advantageous to study states with higher energy , that corresponds to shorter wavelength , than was done in the present work .",
    "unfortunately computational limitations prevent this , leaving the numerical results inconclusive , as to the existence of scars .",
    "in this work an exact expression for the eigenfunctions of special systems , whose classical dynamics are chaotic , was obtained . these systems ,",
    "tiling billiards on the pseudo - sphere , are special in that many formulae , that for typical chaotic systems are correct only in the leading semiclassical approximation , are exact for them . specific differences between the exact expressions , as well as the approximate ones , and those used for general chaotic systems were identified explicitly .    the main result of this work is , an exact expression for ( the diagonal part of ) green s function , in the form : [ ratiolast ] g_e(,)= whose residues are the squares of the exact eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian .",
    "this result is a manifestation of fredholm theory @xcite for the systems studied here , because that theory predicts that green s function in general can be expressed as such a ratio .",
    "the special feature of tiling billiards on the pseudo - sphere is that both numerator and denominator can be expressed in terms periodic orbits , _ without the introduction of any approximation_. it would be interesting to study the exact connection between the results presented here and those of fredholm theory .",
    "such a connection would supply a recipe for reordering the problematic sums in the numerator and the denominator to ensure rapid convergence to the _ exact _ result .",
    "summation over repetitions , leads to the form of the green function and to the appearance of the spectral determinant in the denominator .",
    "therefore repetitions directly determine the spectrum .",
    "any specific zero is not related to a specific factor in the product of terms of the form of , but rather to a zero of the the product that does not converge absolutely .",
    "this mechanism has been found in earlier work in the framework of the semiclassical approximation @xcite and of fredholm theory @xcite , but here it is established explicitly in the framework of the exact theory .",
    "it was shown that there are three different kinds of contributions to the exact @xmath252 .",
    "the first of these is associated with the non - periodic orbits of the system , the second with the periodic orbits , and the third with their images .",
