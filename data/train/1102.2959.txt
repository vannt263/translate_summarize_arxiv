    "gels form part of our everyday lives , yet are remarkably poorly defined . at moderate timescales ,",
    "gels lack a clear distinction from ` attractive glasses ' at high densities @xcite , while at low densities gels share many characteristics of liquids .",
    "recently however , a distinction has been made between equilibrium and non - equilibrium gels @xcite .",
    "the former are associated with systems whose intermolecular potential is not spherically symmetric , for example limited - valency models lead to equilibrium gels @xcite and ` empty liquids ' @xcite . a second class of gels are formed through arrested metastable gas - liquid phase separation .",
    "in these ` spinodal gels ' the metastable liquid phase is sufficiently dense to undergo dynamical arrest , suppressing demixing @xcite , an extreme case of viscoelastic phase separation @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that the formation of clusters in this dense liquid phase prevents relaxation to the underlying crystal @xcite .",
    "a third type of gel is formed through diffusion - limited cluster aggregation @xcite .",
    "other types of gels form in polymer solutions ( spinodal gels ) , precipitate from solution , for example silica , and are formed by clays such as laponite , the nature of which remains disputed @xcite .",

    "the asakura - oosawa parameters are scaled to aid comparison with the girifalco potential .",
    "[ figu],width=188 ]    all these gels have one thing in common : they are multi - component systems , consisting of a solvent and at least one macromolecular or colloidal component .",
    "although in equilibrium , the degrees of freedom of the solvent and smaller macromolecular / colloidal species can be formally integrated out , leading to a one - component treatment @xcite , it is important to note that consideration of an explicit solvent has recently been implicated in gelation , due to hydrodynamic interactions @xcite .",

    "the clusters are defined according to our topological cluster classification .",
    "c@xmath0 molecules are represented as spheres @xcite .",
    "[ figclusters],width=226 ]    here we enquire whether gels can be formed from a _ single _ molecular species .",
    "it has emerged from the colloid - polymer mixture literature @xcite that gels are associated with systems exhibiting a short - ranged attraction , compared to the particle / molecular diameter .",
    "such systems also tend not to exhibit a stable liquid phase . seeking a molecular system with such properties",
    ", one naturally turns to c@xmath0 . while it is not yet clear whether c@xmath0 has a stable liquid phase @xcite , the commonly used model potential of girifalco [ [ eqgirifalco ] ] @xcite , is understood to exhibit a liquid over a limited range in temperature @xcite .",
    "the short - ranged attractions in c@xmath0 , relative to its molecular size , make it a most suitable candidate for one - component ` spinodal gelation ' .",
    "we shall thus pose the question : can c@xmath0 form a gel ?    .",
    "light dashed line is a guide to the eye denoting the liquid - gas binodal and solid line indicates freezing ( from @xcite ) .",
    "percolation at low temperature is indicated by the solid black line .",
    "state points sampled with constant temperature simulations and corresponding structures are denoted as follows : ( f ) supercritical fluid , red circles ; ( f * ) non - phase separated metastable fluid green circle ; ( x ) phase - separated crystal , blue triangles ; ( c ) isolated clusters , open square ; gels , purple squares .",
    "[ figphasediagram],width=226 ]    before proceeding , let us be clear about what we mean by gelation in this paper .",
    "certainly , gels are percolating networks . in the case of c@xmath0",
    ", dynamical arrest will be required to prevent phase separation on the measurement timescale . to create such a spinodal gel",
    ", we shall therefore quench c@xmath0 into the region of the phase diagram where gas - liquid phase separation may form a bicontinuous spinodal - like texture and undergo dynamical arrest . by dynamical arrest , we require that the percolating structure persists on the simulation timescale . our requirement that phase separation is suppressed on the molecular lengthscale distinguishes our approach from materials such as fumed silica , which is formed from agglomerates of particles of condensed amorphous silica @xcite .    as in a previous study on a colloidal system @xcite , we shall characterise the structure in terms of clusters formed by small groups of c@xmath0 molecules in isolation .",
    "the structures formed are then analysed in terms of topologies based on the minimum energy clusters using an algorithm we have recently developed for identifying clusters in condensed phases , the topological cluster classification ( tcc ) @xcite .",
    "clusters of c@xmath0 molecules have received considerable attention @xcite and for small clusters the ground states are known both experimentally @xcite and computationally @xcite . moreover",
    ", numerical studies have shown that for larger clusters c@xmath0 exhibits kinetic trapping , leading to a discrepancy between predicted ground state structures @xcite and those observed experimentally below @xmath2 k , which required annealing to access the ground state @xcite .",
    "we shall use molecular dynamics simulation to capture the behaviour of c@xmath0 on a timescale and system size sufficient that we may discuss gelation . for this purpose",
    ", we use the intermolecular interaction potential proposed by girifalco @xcite , which reads    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 angstroms , @xmath6 erg , @xmath7 erg .",
    "the girifalco potential is plotted in [ figu ] .",
    "this girifalco model is known to undergo dynamical arrest at high temperature and density @xcite .",
    "the glass line intersects the gas - liquid spinodal at around @xmath8 k , while crystallisation is expected at higher temperature @xcite .",
    "while locally crystalline structures still meet our criterion for gelation ( ie a long - lived network ) , the absence of vitrification of the dense phase suggests that demixing may proceed . to prevent demixing",
    ", we need to quench below @xmath9 . noting that free surfaces enhance local diffusion  @xcite",
    ", we expect that it will be necessary to quench well below @xmath9 .",
    "this is consistent with experimental work where annealing to @xmath10 k enabled small clusters to equilibrate  @xcite .",
    "figure 1 also depicts the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) potential  @xcite often used to described colloid - polymer mixtures .",
    "the ao potential is plotted here to correspond to a polymer - colloid size ratio of 0.18  @xcite which leads to a relative interaction range rather shorter than that of the girifalco potential .",
    "our procedure is therefore as follows : we simulate girifalco c@xmath0 at constant temperature , following an ` instantaneous ' quench to enquire at what , if any , temperature , c@xmath0 forms a gel stable on the simulation timescale .",
    "we then perform quenches from high temperature to determine what quench rate is required to form gels .",
    "we carry out simulations of two types . constant temperature simulations , where the system is run up to @xmath11 timesteps ( @xmath12 ns ) and sampled for a further @xmath13 timesteps , and temperature quenches where temperature is decreased from @xmath14 @xmath15 to @xmath16 @xmath15 at rates between @xmath17 and @xmath18 ks@xmath19 .",
    "state points sampled for constant temperature simulations are shown in [ figphasediagram ] . throughout",
    "we use molecular dynamics simulation with a gaussian thermostat @xcite with a timestep of @xmath20 fs .",
    "we typically used 4000 or 2048 c@xmath0 molecules .",
    "runs with 4000 particles showed no qualitative differences . occasionally , long times required smaller simulations of 864 particles .",
    "data are shown after 9.96 ns of ` equilibration ' or ` aging ' , unless otherwise stated .",

    "we focus on data taken along the critical isochore @xmath21 nm@xmath22 unless otherwise stated .",
    "results at lower density @xmath23 nm@xmath22 are qualitatively similar .      to analyse the structure , we identify the bond network . here",
    "we define two molecules as bonded if they approach within @xmath24 nm , which is the approximate location of the first minimum of the pair correlation function @xmath25 upon condensation .",
    "having identified the bond network , we use the topological cluster classification ( tcc ) to determine the nature of the cluster  @xcite .",
    "this analysis identifies all the shortest path three , four and five membered rings in the bond network .",
    "we use the tcc to identify structures of between 5 and 13 molecules which are topologically equivalent to ground states for the girifalco potential ( [ eqgirifalco ] ) @xcite .",
    "the clusters we identify are depicted in [ figclusters ] .",
    "in addition we identify the fcc and hcp thirteen particle structures in terms of a central particle and its twelve nearest neighbours . for spherically",
    "symmetric potentials differing cluster structures are found as a function of interaction range @xcite . for 11-membered clusters",
    ", our topological approach does not distinguish between @xmath26 ( 11d in @xcite ) and @xmath27 ( 11c in @xcite ) .",
    "likewise for 12-membered clusters @xmath26 ( 12c in @xcite ) and @xmath28 ( 12b in @xcite ) are identical for our purposes",
    ". for more details see @xcite .",
    "if a molecule is found to be part of more than one cluster , we count it as the larger cluster . moreover ,",
    "if a molecule is found to be part of both a hcp and fcc local environment ( for example in random close packed stacking ) , we count it as fcc .",
    "we begin our presentation of the results by discussing our interpretation of the different structures we find .",
    "the equilibrium phase diagram is sketched in [ figphasediagram ] @xcite and typical structures are shown in [ figpretty ] .",
    "however , the system is not always able to fully equilibrate on the simulation timescale , a point to which we return below . for the densities we consider , at temperatures less than the triple point ( around 1880 k @xcite ) , equilibrium for the girifalco model of c@xmath0 is gas - crystal coexistence .",
    "however , for weak degrees of undercooling , crystal nucleation may not occur on the system sizes and timescales we consider , while for deep quenches , dynamical arrest limits access to equilibrium . in our simulations , these two non - equilibrium states are manifested as a metastable fluid , which can ( but does not always ) undergo phase separation prior to crystallisation , and a gel which forms a percolating network respectively .",
    "we identify these states by visual inspection of coordinate data and also require that more that 50% of molecules are in a locally hcp or fcc environment according to the tcc for any state point to be considered to be crystalline .",
    "we further require that gel states exhibit slow dynamics , in other words , that they do not phase separate or significantly coarsen on the simulation timescale .",
    "more rigorous approaches , notably testing for percolation , have the disadvantage that for the system sizes we are able to tackle here , for @xmath29 nm@xmath22 , all state points were found to percolate according to our bonding criterion , despite the different structures evident in [ figpretty ] . at low density ,",
    "isolated clusters were found [ [ figpretty](d ) ] . in our simulations , these clearly do not form a percolating network .",

    "the data are offset for clarity .",
    "[ figmsdg ]    we have argued that in the case of c@xmath0 , gelation should be associated with slow dynamics .",
    "plotting the mean squared displacement ( msd ) at different temperatures in [ figmsdg](a ) , we see a sharp fall in msd between t=1400 and 1000 k. thus we expect that , at 1000 k and below , we may find gelation",
    ". inspection of the coordinate data in [ figpretty](b ) shows that at 1000 k , c@xmath0 crystallises on our simulation timescales .",
    "this is consistent with nucleation studies carried out at higher density @xcite .",
    "however at some of the lower temperatures we consider , it is clear c@xmath0 is sufficiently arrested that little restructuring is seen on the simulation timescale .",
    "dynamically , therefore , it is possible that c@xmath0 can satisfy our requirements for classification as a gel .",
    "we note that these measures are performed on a system which is not in equilibrium for some state points .",
    "however , our intention here is to _ qualitatively _ demonstrate a substantial slowing of the dynamics .     as a function of inverse temperature .",

    "shaded regions are a guide to the eye .",

    ", a fluid @xmath25 is found .",
    "note that even at temperatures below the triple point @xcite , we see little change in @xmath25 on these simulation timescales .",
    "however , at lower temperatures ( 1000 k ) , the system crystallises . at lower temperatures still ( 300 k ) , although there is some local structure , overall the ordering is reduced . for temperatures less than around 1000",
    "k @xmath25 takes values substantially greater than unity at short range .",
    "this indicates density fluctuations on the lengthscale of a few particle diameters .",
    "while the limited size of our simulations preclude a definitive statement , we note that such local density fluctuations are indicative of networks , such a that found in [ figpretty](c ) .    using the topological cluster classification ,",
    "the same three regimes are identified , as shown in [ figtcc ] . at high temperatures",
    "( t@xmath311400 k ) , the population of all clusters rises sharply upon reducing the temperature . around 1000k ,",
    "the structure is dominated by molecules in a locally crystalline environment , and the population of other clusters drops . at lower temperatures still , the population of locally fcc and hcp molecules drops , and the system is once again dominated by amorphous clusters .",
    "of these , at 300 k , 11-membered @xmath26 clusters are the most numerous , accounting for some 20% of the total population of c@xmath0 molecules .",

    "nevertheless , there is some degree of coarsening .",
    "we investigate possible coarsening mechanisms by considering the mean squared displacement of particles on the surface and in the interior of the ` arms ' of the gel .",

    "however such ` instantaneous quenches ' are unphysical for molecular systems ( although essentially accessible to soft matter systems such as colloids ) .",

    "we choose to quench from a supercritical fluid at @xmath14 k to @xmath16 k. inspection of the phase diagram suggests that , for sufficiently slow quench rates , we might expect phase separation to occur in temperature regime @xmath41 k @xmath31 t@xmath31@xmath40 k , and that crystallisation may also occur .",

    ". a slower quench rate of @xmath17 ks@xmath19results in a crystalline structure , which undergoes phase separation , similar to [ figpretty](b ) .",
    "this observation is confirmed with the tcc analysis , where we consider the cluster populations in the quenched systems . in [ figquenchtcc](a ) we show average cluster populations for runs of 9.96 ns following the quench , and find a clear shift to a crystal - dominated structure for the slowest quench rate .",

    "we begin the discussion by considering how practically realisable the c@xmath0 gels we have predicted might be .",
    "we have shown that gels form and exist on a simulation timescale of 10 ns .",
    "this leads to two main questions : firstly , can the gels form in the first place and secondly , how long can they last ? evidence from experimental work on clusters of c@xmath0 molecules suggests that in fact , long - lived metastable states are possible . below around 500 k ,",
    "clusters show little preference for ground states @xcite .",
    "we thus argue that c@xmath0 can be prevented from equilibrating on an experimental timescale at room temperature , although we note that some aging can be seen in our simulations .",
    "the first question is potentially more challenging .",
    "the quench rates we have used are not currently experimentally feasible ( maximum quench rates are around 10@xmath44 ks@xmath19by vapor deposition ) .",
    "our predictions are that c@xmath0 will phase separate to crystal - gas coexistence on such a timescale .",
    "however , shear could be used to prevent crystallisation during quenching , allowing milder quench rates .",
    "other possibilities include compressing low - temperature amorphous clusters .",
    "we note in [ figpretty](d ) that the isolated clusters formed at t@xmath45 k are far from spherical and might reasonably be expected to form a gel upon increasing the density .",
    "following @xcite we also note that the girifalco potential is not the only model for c@xmath0 .",
    "the pacheco - prates - ramalho model @xcite is in fact more sticky ( shorter ranged ) than that of girifalco , which would be expected to promote gelation .",
    "another approach to producing one - component gels might be to consider larger fullerenes whose dynamics will be much slower .",
    "such a candidate is c@xmath46which may also exhibit a molecular shape with high symmetry and stability @xcite , although its high binding energy would necessitate quenching from very high temperatures at which thermal stability of the fullerene molecule may become a problem .",
    "the same might even hold for c@xmath0 whose thermal stability at high temperatures ( such as criticality ) is disputed @xcite , although at temperatures below 1700 k c@xmath0 is likely stable , so compressing disordered clusters remains a potential experimental route to forming gels of c@xmath0 .",
    "the behaviour exhibited by c@xmath0 in the constant temperature simulations may be compared with that observed in colloidal suspensions , where interactions may be tuned @xcite , and which typically undergo ` instantaneous ' quenching , due to the slow relaxation time of the mesoscopic colloidal particles .",
    "the main difference between the results presented here and those from a previous study on a colloidal gel @xcite are that c@xmath0 exhibits a regime of crystallisation , which is almost entirely absent from the colloidal system , where the crystal - like local structures accounted for no more than one particle in 1000",
    ". there are at least three possible reasons for this difference .",
    "the first is that the relative interaction range is substantially longer in the case of c@xmath0 and this may facilitate crystallisation ( see [ figu ] ) .",
    "secondly , colloids are polydisperse , which might suppress , although should not prevent , crystallisation @xcite .",
    "finally , we have used newtonian dynamics for c@xmath0 while colloids are diffusive , although we are unaware of any studies considering the role of dynamics in crystallisation . in colloid simulation work with brownian dynamics  @xcite with parameters comparable to experiments",
    "@xcite there is some evidence that crystallisation can occur on the low temperature side of the metastable gas - liquid binodal in a monodisperse system .",
    "this suggests that the role of polydispersity in the colloid experiments may be important in suppressing crystallisation .",
    "in summary , we have presented numerical evidence that c@xmath0 , under the right conditions can form a gel , which forms through arrested spinodal decomposition .",
    "potentially , therefore , one - component gels might be realised .",
    "whether these conditions are experimentally accessible remains an open question .",

    "<S> until now , gels have been formed of multicomponent soft matter systems , consisting of a solvent and one or more macromolecular or colloidal species . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for sufficient quench rates , the girifalco model of c@xmath0 can form gels which we identify by their slow dynamics and long - lived network structure . </S>",
    "<S> these gels are stable at room temperature , at least on the simulation timescale up to 100 ns . at moderate temperatures around 1000 k , below the bulk glass transition temperature , c@xmath0 exhibits crystallisation and phase separation proceeds without the dynamical arrest associated with gelation , in contrast to many colloidal systems . </S>"
