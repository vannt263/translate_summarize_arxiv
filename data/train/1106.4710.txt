    "at the close of the nineteenth century the italian economist vilfredo pareto , while studying the statistics of human income and wealth , discovered that the distribution @xmath10 of both has a remarkable power - law form , @xmath18 @xcite , where @xmath5 is a parameter which is now called the pareto index .",
    "thereafter , pareto s law was verified for various countries , both for the wealth of individuals and for their income , and was also observed in empirical data for diverse scientific fields ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it was realized that the pareto index measured from the income distribution is typically larger than the index @xmath19 deduced from the distribution of wealth .",
    "this is , of course , consistent with the general observation that in market economies wealth is more unequally distributed than income @xcite . for the wealth distribution ,",
    "the observed pareto index @xmath19 is as high as @xmath20 for developed countries , but may be as low as @xmath21 for a developing economy like india @xcite .    as a matter of fact",
    ", only very few real - world distributions may follow a power law over their entire range . as a distribution of wealth , which is large but nonetheless finite ,",
    "the pareto distribution ( pd ) is not an exception . in the analysis of data ,",
    "one uses different forms of truncated pds , such as , _",
    "e.g. _ , the bounded distribution @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are lower and upper cut - offs , respectively , and @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "some real - world examples are not that abrupt so that one seeks to fit the data using a smoother truncation procedure , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the modified bessel function . in both eqs .",
    "( [ trunc1 ] ) and ( [ trunc2 ] ) a power - law emerges as an intermediate behavior , so that @xmath10 has moments of arbitrary order .",
    "before we proceed , it might be useful to remark that the exponentially - truncated distribution in eq .",
    "( [ trunc2 ] ) is rather ubiquitous and appears in many areas in physics . to name but a few we mention the distribution of the first passage times for random motion with a bias @xcite , the distribution of times between action potentials ( or the isi distribution ) in the integrate - and - fire model of neuron dynamics @xcite , the distribution of the stopping distances for the sliding motion of a solid block on an inclined heterogeneous plane @xcite , the avalanche life - time distribution in the mean - field version of the bak - sneppen model @xcite , probability current distribution in disordered systems @xcite and the distribution of the number of times a particle diffusing in a sphere hits its boundary @xcite",
    "thus our subsequent analysis applies to these systems as well .    in this paper",
    "we seek an answer to the following question : suppose in a given tempered paretian ensemble one selects at random two individuals with wealths @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "how different are @xmath2 and @xmath3 ? in quest for the answer , we introduce a random variable , @xmath28 which defines the contribution of one of two individuals to the total wealth @xmath29 of two of them , and calculate its distribution function @xmath0 .",
    "note that the random variables in eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) have apparently first been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite within a general context of heavy - tailed , non - truncated distributions not having a second , nor even a first , moment .",
    "it was realized that for @xmath30 the distribution @xmath0 has a characteristic @xmath31-shape form with a minimum at @xmath12 . in our language",
    ", this means that for such unbounded distributions @xmath32 is the least probable event , and the wealth distribution is highly disproportionate .",
    "note that recently the distribution of more general variables of the form @xmath33 have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for different heavy - tailed and tempered parental distributions @xmath10 .    in our case ,",
    "all moments of @xmath10 exist .",
    "moreover , since @xmath34 for arbitrary @xmath35 , one may generally expect that @xmath0 will be a unimodal distribution peaked at @xmath12 .",
    "we set out to show instead that this is not always the case but that surprisingly , the distribution @xmath0 exhibits a rather rich , sometimes counterintuitive behavior . in particular , we will demonstrate that for tempered distributions with @xmath14 the distribution @xmath0 undergoes a transition from a bell - shaped form ( so that @xmath32 is the most probable event ) to an @xmath17-shaped ( for smoothly truncated @xmath10 ) and a three - modal ( for bounded @xmath10 ) forms when @xmath15 becomes less than some threshold value @xmath36 .",
    "this furnishes another striking example that random variables with tempered heavy tails can be similar , in important respects , to random variables with non - truncated heavy tails @xcite .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the moment generating function of @xmath38 : @xmath39 performing the integration over @xmath40 , we formally change the integration variable @xmath41 , so that @xmath42 from which we can read off the desired distribution : @xmath43 one may readily verify that @xmath0 is normalized , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath44 , once @xmath10 is normalized . note , as well , that for arbitrary @xmath10 one finds from eq .",
    "( [ dist ] ) that @xmath45 , which can be readily seen from the following simple argument : @xmath46 we will show in what follows that the average behavior is not representative , and under certain conditions does not coincide with typical or most probable behavior .     in eq .",

    "consider first the bounded pd in eq .",
    "( [ trunc1 ] ) . note that for such a distribution , the choice of a random variable as in eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) will automatically lead to a symmetric distribution function that depends on @xmath23 and @xmath24 only via the ratio @xmath15 , and has a support not on @xmath48 $ ] but on a smaller interval @xmath49 $ ] where , for @xmath8 , @xmath50 . substituting eq .",
    "( [ trunc1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ dist ] ) we find @xmath51 with @xmath52 a straightforward analysis shows that for @xmath53 , regardless of the value of @xmath54 , @xmath0 is unimodal with a maximum at @xmath12 .",
    "this signifies that in this case most probably @xmath32 , and hence , both individuals in such a paretian ensemble contribute to the total wealth _ proportionally_.     in eq .",

    "[ sketch2 ] and [ sketch1 ] .",
    "it has a cusp - like maximum at @xmath12 ; @xmath0 becomes narrower and the height of the maximum , @xmath56 , increases as the pareto index @xmath19 increases . on the other hand , @xmath0 broadens as @xmath57 and @xmath56 decreases",
    "this is , of course , quite a plausible behavior which one may expect on intuitive grounds .     in eq .",
    "( [ expl ] ) for @xmath58 and different @xmath54 .",
    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]    when @xmath30 the situation appears to be more interesting and complicated .",
    "as in the previous case , here @xmath0 always has a cusp - like maximum at @xmath12 . however , there exists a critical value @xmath36 of the parameter @xmath54 at which two inflection points emerge symmetrically in the regions @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for @xmath16",
    "each of these inflection points splits into a minimum and a maximum so that @xmath0 attains a three - modal , @xmath61-shaped form .",
    "when @xmath54 becomes yet smaller than some other critical @xmath62 , one observes that the value of @xmath0 at these local maxima becomes greater than @xmath63 .",
    "this signifies that in such a paretian ensemble most probably the two individuals , selected at random , have disproportionate wealth since @xmath64 or @xmath65 .",
    "let us discuss this case more precisely , focussing on @xmath58 , for which the loci of the extrema can be found explicitly .",
    "the distribution @xmath0 for this particular case is depicted in fig .",
    "[ sketch3 ] .",
    "one finds that the critical value of @xmath54 at which two inflection points emerge is @xmath66 for @xmath16 , each extremum splits into a minimum and a maximum at locations @xmath67 further on , at @xmath68 , which is given by @xmath69 all three maxima become equally high , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath70 ( see the bold black line in fig .  [ sketch3 ] ) . for",
    "yet smaller values of @xmath54 , the maximum at @xmath12 becomes smaller than the ones at @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "hence , in the latter case it is most probable that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are disproportionately different and either of them , with equal probability , dominates the total wealth .",
    "consider next the exponentially - truncated @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ trunc2 ] ) . substituting @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ trunc2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ dist ] ) , we get @xmath73 note that @xmath0 vanishes at the edges @xmath74 and @xmath75 exponentially fast and is symmetric around @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , one may readily check that the first derivative of @xmath0 at @xmath12 vanishes so that @xmath0 is smooth at @xmath12 , as compared to the cusp - like behavior observed in case of a bounded pd .",
    "the question now is whether @xmath12 is always a maximum .     in eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) for @xmath76 and different @xmath54 .",
    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]    expanding @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) in a taylor series around @xmath12 , we get , omitting insignificant numerical factors , @xmath77 where the constant before the quadratic term reads @xmath78    observe that @xmath79 is always negative for any @xmath53 .",
    "this means that @xmath0 is always a bell - shaped function with a _ maximum _ at @xmath12 .",
    "hence , as in the case of a bounded pd , in this case it is most likely that the wealths @xmath2 and @xmath3 of two randomly selected individuals will be the same .",
    "typical profiles of @xmath0 for @xmath76 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ sketch4 ] and show that the form of the distribution is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath54 .    note next that the case @xmath55 appears to be somewhat special since @xmath80 when @xmath57 .",
    "this means that for sufficiently small values of @xmath54 the distribution @xmath0 will become nearly uniform ( apart of an exponential truncation in the vicinity of the edges ) .",
    "this trend is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ sketch5 ] and signifies that for such paretian ensembles the contribution of each of the individuals to the total wealth can have _ any _ value ( inside the edges of the distribution ) with equal probability .     in eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) for @xmath55 and different @xmath54 .",
    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]    we finally turn to the case @xmath14 .",
    "one can readily see that here , as in the case of a bounded pd , there exists a critical value @xmath36 , defined implicitly by the following transcendental equation , @xmath81 for @xmath82 , @xmath0 is always a bell - shaped function with a maximum at @xmath12 . for @xmath83 , @xmath84 except for narrow regions at the edges , where it vanishes exponentially .",
    "lastly , for @xmath16 , @xmath0 has a bimodal @xmath17-like shape , with maxima close to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath12 being the least probable value , which is different from the three - modal @xmath61-shaped form observed for a bounded pd .",
    "this signifies again that for @xmath16 and @xmath30 the least probable event is that @xmath32 and most likely either of two contributions completely dominate the total wealth , _ i.e. _ , the distribution of wealth is disproportionate . in fig .",
    "[ sketch6 ] we depict different possible forms of @xmath0 for the particular case @xmath85 .",
    "note that for an exponentially - truncated distribution the critical value of @xmath54 is somewhat larger , @xmath86 , than the corresponding value @xmath87 found for the bounded pd .     in eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) for @xmath58 and different @xmath54 .",
    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]",
    "to conclude , we have studied here the distribution @xmath0 of the random variable @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the wealths of two individuals selected at random from the same tempered paretian ensemble characterized by truncated pareto distributions in eqs .",
    "( [ trunc1 ] ) or ( [ trunc2 ] ) .",
    "we have shown that , for @xmath11 , @xmath0 always has a unimodal form and is peaked at @xmath12 , so that most probably @xmath13 . for @xmath14 ( which may be observed for developing economies , such as , _",
    "e.g. _ , india @xcite ) we have encountered a more complicated behavior which depends on the value of @xmath15 . in particular , we have realized that for @xmath16 - a certain threshold value - @xmath0 has a three - modal ( for a bounded @xmath6 ) and a bimodal @xmath17-shape ( for an exponential @xmath6 ) form which signifies that in such ensembles the wealths @xmath2 and @xmath3 are disproportionately different .",
    "such a behavior appears to be quite surprising in view of the fact that the parental distributions @xmath10 have moments of arbitrary order .",
    "our findings are summarized in the `` phase - diagrams '' presented in figs .",
    "( [ sketch7 ] ) and ( [ sketch8 ] ) .     separates the domains in which @xmath0 is always unimodal ( @xmath11 ) or may have a different shape depending on the value of @xmath54 .",
    "a horizontal line @xmath88 separates the domain in which @xmath0 is unimodal and the domain in which @xmath0 attains a three - modal , @xmath61-like shape with the maximum at @xmath12 being higher than two local maxima near the edges . above the horizontal line @xmath89 one observes a three - modal distribution @xmath0 in which two maxima near the edges are higher than the one at @xmath12 .",
    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]     separates the regimes in which @xmath0 is always unimodal ( @xmath11 ) or may have a different shape depending on the value of @xmath54 . a horizontal line @xmath88 separates the domain in which @xmath0 is unimodal and the domain in which @xmath0 attains a bimodal , @xmath17-like shape with a minimum at @xmath12 and two maxima close to the edges .",
    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]    we finally remark that a similar shape reversal of the distribution function has been observed for melting kinetics of a heteropolymer @xcite and for the black - scholes model of the stock options evolution in mathematical finance @xcite .",
    "both works dealt with the parental distribution @xmath10 of the @xmath90-variables which , in addition to a power - law intermediate tail , has a log - normal truncation for large values of @xmath90 , rather than an exponential one , and an exponential one for small values of @xmath90 .",
    "this , of course , yields quantitatively different values of the critical parameters but qualitatively the effect is the same .",
    "we believe that the effect that we have found here is quite universal for the tempered paretian ensembles , and also quite robust .",
    "in particular , we expect , as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for different cut - off functions , that it withstands correlations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as long as the correlation length does not exceed a certain critical value .",
