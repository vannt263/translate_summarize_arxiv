    "* for a recent compilation ) , cmb anisotropy has been measured over a range of multipoles of @xmath5 ( or angular scales of @xmath6 ) .    at low multipoles",
    "( @xmath7 ) anisotropy is primarily generated at @xmath8 except at very low multipoles ( @xmath9 ) where late - time decay of gravitational potential contributes significantly . at higher multipoles ( smaller angular scales )",
    "low - redshift sources generate a significant amount of fluctuation power . at the observing frequencies of cbi and bima ( @xmath10 30 ghz ) , the largest sources of low - redshift anisotropy are radio point sources and the thermal sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) effect .",
    "the latter is of cosmological interest and may be large enough to be detected , depending on cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the reported detections of power at small angular scales ( @xmath11 ) have argued that point - source contamination is not a problem , suggesting that the detected power could be due to the sz effect @xcite .",
    "since the number density and brightness of the sources contributing to the sz fluctuations ( i.e. , hot gas in galaxy clusters at @xmath12 ) depend on the background cosmology , the level of the sz fluctuations depends on cosmological parameters .",
    "the sz angular power spectrum is sensitive to the matter - fluctuation amplitude and the baryon density of the universe but relatively insensitive to the matter density of the universe @xcite or other cosmological parameters @xcite . by fitting the cbi and bima data to theoretical predictions",
    ", @xcite have found a constraint on linear r.m.s .",
    "mass fluctuations within an @xmath13 sphere , @xmath3 , as @xmath14 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "on the other hand , observations of the primary cmb anisotropy and the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe have already provided tight constraints on cosmological parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by using these constraints",
    "we can predict how much sz power ought to be seen at the cbi and bima multipole bands . by doing",
    "so we can see if an sz interpretation of the small - scale fluctuations is consistent with cosmological models favored by cmb or lss . in this _",
    "letter _ we estimate the level of the sz angular power spectrum expected from cosmological models consistent with cmb data at @xmath15 , and compare it with the cbi and bima data at @xmath16 .",
    "we use only cmb data and a prior on the hubble constant and do not include any constraints from lss . for the primary cmb data , we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) results of @xcite as an estimate of the appropriate weighting for each cosmological model . for the sz effect",
    ", we use a model for the sz power spectrum as a function of cosmology from @xcite . in  [ sec : cmb ] we outline salient features of the mcmc results . in  [ sec : sz ] we sketch out our calculation of the sz power spectrum , including the effects of the non - gaussian nature of the sz fluctuations . in  [ sec : results ] we compare mcmc realizations of the sz power spectrum weighted by the primary cmb data with the cbi and bima data , and check for consistency between them . in  [ sec : disc ] we discuss implications for the reported detections of power at small angular scales .",
    "as a subset of cosmological models consistent with the current cmb data , we use the mcmc results of @xcite ( for details see http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc ) . estimating cosmological parameters using mcmc methods @xcite entails taking random steps in parameter space , accepting a step if the new point is more likely , otherwise accepting the step with some probability ( less than one ) set by how much worse the new point is than the current point . the resulting list of points should sample the likelihood function in the multidimensional parameter space .",
    "an advantage of mcmc methods ( besides often being faster than grids ) is that the resulting list of consistent models ( the `` chain '' ) provides a self - consistent sampling of the likelihood distribution .",
    "a distribution of cmb - derived cosmological parameters using the mcmc chain therefore provides a maximally informative cmb prior .",
    "covariances between parameters are naturally incorporated .",
    "the chain provides more samples where the density is higher ; this feature is actually a disadvantage when dealing with models lying in the tail of the distribution , as we will return to later .",
    "the chain that we use @xcite assumes a flat universe , no tensor component , and an equation of state for the dark energy component of @xmath17 ( i.e. , assumes a cosmological constant rather than quintessence ) .",
    "a prior on the hubble constant ( @xmath18 ) consistent with the hubble key project results @xcite is assumed , but no lss priors .",
    "there are six free parameters in the chain : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the baryon density relative to the critical density , @xmath26 the cold dark - matter density , @xmath27 the cosmological - constant energy density , @xmath22 the redshift of reionization , @xmath23 the scalar spectral index , and @xmath24 the amplitude of density fluctuations .",
    "the constraint that spatial curvature is zero defines the hubble constant as @xmath28^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the total matter density @xmath29 and @xmath3 are derived parameters for each model .",
    "there are 2,596 mcmc samples in total .    for each of the cosmological models in the chain ,",
    "we predict the sz power spectrum .",
    "the resulting distribution of powers represents the prior probability of a given amount of sz power , given the current large - angle cmb data , i.e. , cmb - normalized predictions for the sz power spectrum .",
    "the sz effect arises from compton scattering of cmb photons with hot electrons in gas in halos @xcite .",
    "many authors have estimated the sz angular power spectrum @xmath30 using analytic methods or hydrodynamic simulations , with broad agreement between the calculations to within a factor of two at @xmath31 ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * for a recent analytic prediction and comparison between analytic methods and numerical simulations ; see references therein for previous work ) .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath30 is sensitive to the baryon density and @xmath3 with an approximate scaling of @xmath32 , but is almost independent of any other cosmological parameters .",
    "we compute @xmath30 as a sum of one - halo poisson contributions over all halos which can contribute : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the comoving volume of the universe at @xmath35 per steradian , @xmath36 the comoving dark - matter halo mass function , and @xmath37 the spectral function of the sz effect @xcite .",
    "we ignore the correlated contribution as it is unimportant at @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the physics of gas in halos is encoded in @xmath39 , the 2d fourier transform of the compton @xmath40-parameter as a function of halo mass and redshift .",
    "the @xmath40-parameter is directly proportional to the integrated gas pressure along the line of sight ; this leads to @xmath41 .",
    "we use the method of @xcite for computing @xmath30 . in brief , we compute a gas - pressure profile using the universal gas - density and temperature profiles derived by @xcite which make three assumptions about gas in halos : ( 1 ) hydrostatic equilibrium between gas pressure and the gravitational force induced by a universal dark - matter density profile @xcite , ( 2 ) the gas density tracing the dark matter density at large radii , as observed in simulated galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 3 ) a constant polytropic equation of state for the gas .",
    "for the mass function we use the mass function of @xcite .",
    "this prescription has _ no _ free parameters , and is in broad agreement with sz simulations to within a factor of two at @xmath31 , agreeing with simulations at least as well as different simulations agree with each other .    gas cooling , energy feedback , and star formation are not included in our models ; @xcite have argued that these effects are not very important for @xmath30 , which is dominated by gas outside the core of halos .",
    "recently , @xcite have used hydrodynamic simulations to show that these effects affect @xmath30 by no more than a factor of two .",
    "these studies suggest that our theoretical prediction for @xmath30 is accurate to better than a factor of two , and thus mcmc - derived predictions for @xmath30 in the next section can be trusted up to this accuracy .",
    "the sz fluctuations are highly non - gaussian , as characterized by large skewness @xcite ; thus , sampling variance of @xmath30 for the sz fluctuations differs from that for gaussian fluctuations , and measurements of @xmath30 in adjacent bins are highly correlated @xcite .",
    "we have to include the non - gaussianity in the error analysis to interpret observational sz data correctly .",
    "we do this by explicitly including those trispectrum configurations which contribute to the power - spectrum covariance matrix .",
    "the error of @xmath30 in a bin of size @xmath42 is given by @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the angular trispectrum relevant for the non - gaussian sampling variance @xcite , @xmath45 the expression for @xmath46 is correct when both @xmath30 and @xmath44 are sufficiently smooth in @xmath47 as is the case here .",
    "@xcite have found that the predicted @xmath46 agrees with hydrodynamic simulations to within a factor of two .",
    "for the instrumental - noise power spectrum @xmath48 we use @xmath49 , 1000 , 1500 , and @xmath50 at @xmath51 , 2183 , 2630 , and 3266 for cbi , and 720 and 2000  @xmath52 at @xmath53 and 8748 for bima . for sky coverage of observations @xmath54 we use @xmath55 for cbi , and @xmath56 for bima .",
    "the bin sizes are @xmath57 , 378 , 612 , 1000 , 2870 , and 4150 .",
    "although we do not use the exact window functions for the experiments , @xmath30 is very flat at these multipoles , reducing the importance of the window functions .",
    "in figure 1 we show the histogram ( weighted according to the weights of @xcite for each model ) of expected sz power for cbi and bima high-@xmath47 bins , where the three highest-@xmath47 cbi bins and the two bima bins are averaged to single bins for each experiment .",
    "the most likely values for the expected sz power are less than @xmath58 .",
    "the weighted mean values are 97 and @xmath59 for cbi and bima , respectively , while the median values are 79 and @xmath60 .",
    "we also find that the analytic approximate scaling of @xcite at @xmath61 , @xmath62 , gives similar results ; the weighted mean is @xmath58 , while the median is @xmath63 .",
    "@xcite find @xmath64 lower normalization for the scaling relation at the cbi band , slightly shifting the histogram leftward .    for cbi",
    "the 95% lower limit ( assuming gaussian fluctuations ) to the observed anisotropy is @xmath65 , making an sz interpretation of the cbi measurement only marginally consistent with the cmb - calibrated theories .",
    "we show this explicitly in figure 2 where we plot the number of standard deviations of the cbi and bima data relative to the predicted levels of sz fluctuations . we have computed the errors @xmath46 using equation  ( [ eq : err ] ) .",
    "we find that the cbi measurements at @xmath66 and 2630 are inconsistent with most of the models that are consistent with the primary cmb data at greater than 2.5 and @xmath67 levels , respectively .",
    "the rest of the cbi bins and the bima bins are consistent with the predicted levels of the sz effect .",
    "the cutoff at the @xmath68 level in figure 2 is due to instrumental noise . at the @xmath68",
    "level the current data are consistent with no sz signal .",
    "thus , lower noise experiments could extend the histograms to larger @xmath69 values .",
    "note that the largest values of @xmath69 in the figure are higher than signal - to - noise ratios of cbi quoted by @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath46 depends on the sz power spectrum ; a lower sz power spectrum leads to lower sample variance , and therefore a smaller @xmath46 . as a result ,",
    "at the largest @xmath69 the instrumental noise determines @xmath46 entirely , making it smaller than the quoted cbi errors .    which models can account for the data at @xmath70 ?",
    "we find that those models typically have @xmath2 and @xmath19 higher than the bbn - allowed value of @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "a simple scaling of @xmath72 accounts for this ; thus , we need @xmath2 for a given bbn value of @xmath73 to account for the cbi data by the sz effect .",
    "this conclusion agrees with @xcite and @xcite .    in principle , it would be straightforward to do a joint likelihood analysis of the primary cmb and the sz effect using cmb data on all angular scales . in practice ,",
    "the strong non - gaussianity of the sz signal , combined with the uncertain field selection effects ( e.g. , no bright point sources ) make such a procedure still premature .",
    "furthermore , the required @xmath2 is in the tail of the cmb - preferred distribution , so the resolution of the mcmc chain is poor in this region .",
    "importance sampling becomes unreliable in regions where the density of points is low .",
    "we have presented estimates of the sz angular power spectrum at @xmath74 for cosmological models that are consistent with the current cmb anisotropy data at @xmath7 .",
    "the mode of distribution of the predicted sz power at @xmath75 is 50  @xmath52 , while we find that the weighted mean is 97  @xmath52 ( the median is 78.5  @xmath52 ) , still significantly lower than the reported cbi detection of anisotropy on these angular scales , 508  @xmath52 .",
    "moving out from the mode at levels of equal likelihood , the ranges of power enclosed by 68% and 95% of the distribution are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "this is effectively a calculation of the primary cmb prior for the sz power spectrum at the cbi band . when compared to the quoted 68% ( @xmath78 ) and 95% ( @xmath79 ) regions of the cbi detection at face value , we find that the cbi detection is only marginally consistent with the sz effect .",
    "the bima detection is fully consistent with the sz effect .    by doing a careful statistical analysis , taking into account the non - gaussianity of sz fluctuations and sampling variance",
    ", we find that an sz interpretation of the cbi data is inconsistent at more than @xmath0 for those cosmological models which are most consistent with the primary cmb data .",
    "the models with the highest sz power share several characteristics : all models with more than 400  @xmath52 of power but a few exceptions have @xmath80 and @xmath81 . furthermore , such models prefer a low hubble constant ( @xmath82 ) and a high matter density ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "a reason for a low @xmath84 is that the primary cmb data tightly constrain @xmath85 while we need a higher @xmath73 to make the sz effect larger .",
    "we can accomplish this by increasing @xmath25 while reducing @xmath84 slightly within the hst-@xmath84 prior .",
    "a model with large red tilt ( @xmath86 ) can not produce a large amount of sz power .",
    "the possible presence of radio point sources that partially `` fill in '' the sz effect from clusters @xcite further enhances the possible discrepancy .",
    "a reliable determination of @xmath3 significantly lower than 1 would be very difficult to reconcile with an sz interpretation of the measured high-@xmath47 power .",
    "uncertainty in estimates for the sz power spectrum is not yet fully understood , making a more detailed interpretation of the excess power complicated .",
    "a major issue is that different simulations have not yet converged , even for adiabatic simulations .",
    "although our current knowledge of missing physics such as gas cooling , star formation , or energy feedback is still limited , these effects appear to not be very important @xcite except on very small angular scales ( @xmath87 or @xmath88 ) where other effects like non - sphericity or merging of halos may also play a role .",
    "nevertheless , the current differences among analytic models , simulations , and estimates of the effects of missing physics are at the level of a factor of two in @xmath30 , while the discrepancy between these predictions and the cbi data is about a factor of five .    given the strong dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath3",
    ", we argue that the discrepancy is due to the difference between a low @xmath1 favored by the primary cmb and a high @xmath2 favored by the sz effect @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have found similarly low @xmath3 from the primary cmb data with the same prior on @xmath84 .",
    "_ if the excess power is really due to the sz effect",
    "_ , then this discrepancy is suggesting that there are some missing components in our analysis .",
    "multi - band sz observations covering several frequencies will be required to verify the apparent discrepancy .    what is missing in our analysis ?",
    "the chain that we have used has a strong hst prior on @xmath84 .",
    "lower values of @xmath84 reduce the discrepancy , but @xmath89 would be required to explain the entire difference .",
    "additional components such as massive neutrinos would make the discrepancy worse by driving @xmath3 to even lower values . allowing tensor modes will have competing effects of reducing the overall normalization of scalar modes at large scales but also allowing a blue tilt ( higher @xmath23 ) , leaving the effects on cluster scales largely unchanged . the effect of allowing a general equation of state for the dark energy will be to slightly enhance the sz fluctuations for a fixed value of @xmath3 @xcite , but to significantly reduce the cmb - preferred value of @xmath3 . with the sz fluctuation power going as @xmath90 , the latter effect will dominate and @xmath91 will generally reduce the expected fluctuation power .",
    "the addition of isocurvature fluctuations may help to reconcile the discrepancy , while it significantly expands the allowed range of many cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "a very early reionization of the universe ( @xmath92 ) will increase the cmb - preferred value of @xmath3 , helping to reduce the discrepancy .",
    "we find a broad peak in the distribution of models in the chain around @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the thomson - scattering optical depth of the universe ; @xmath95 or @xmath96 would comfortably allow @xmath97 .",
    "the discrepancy thus disappears if the universe was reionized early .",
    "the current cmb data can not break the degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath94 , and allow this area of parameter space , although @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) appears to be ruled out .",
    "cmb - polarization experiments on large angular scales ( e.g. , map or planck ) should be able to break this degeneracy , and detect the signature of reionization @xcite .",
    "we have presented an example of the ease and power of mcmc methods in applying cmb constraints to calculations that include non - trivial dependence on cosmological parameters .",
    "it would be worthwhile to investigate the effects of lss priors , which should make the discrepancy worse by making @xmath3 smaller @xcite . with the strong preference of the high-@xmath47 measurements for high values of @xmath3 and @xmath100 , it would require running a new chain that includes the cbi and bima data points , as importance sampling is unreliable in the tails of the current distribution .",
    "measurements of cmb anisotropy will continue to improve .",
    "mcmc methods provide a natural way to incorporate strong constraints on cosmological parameters from cmb experiments into other cosmological studies .",
    "using cmb information to understand the effects of cosmology will allow better understandings of systematic errors in the measurements and insight into important astrophysical processes ."
