    "the simplex method is `` the classic example of an algorithm that is known to perform well in practice but which takes exponential time in the worst case '' @xcite . in an attempt to explain this behavior , spielman and teng @xcite introduced the concept of _ smoothed analysis _ of algorithms , in which one measures the expected complexity of an algorithm under slight random perturbations of arbitrary inputs .",
    "they proved that a variant of the simplex method has polynomial smoothed complexity .",
    "consider a linear program of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an @xmath8 matrix , representing @xmath0 constraints , and @xmath9 is a vector representing @xmath1 variables .",
    "a simplex method starts at some vertex @xmath10 of the polytope @xmath11 , found by a method , and then walks on the vertices of the polytope toward the solution of ( lp ) .",
    "a pivot rule dictates how to choose the next vertex in this walk .",
    "the complexity of the simplex method is then determined by the length of the walk  the number of pivot steps .",
    "so far , smoothed analysis has only been done for the shadow - vertex pivot rule introduced by gaas and saaty @xcite .",
    "the shadow - vertex simplex method first chooses an _ initial objective function _",
    "@xmath12 optimized by the initial vertex @xmath10 .",
    "then it interpolates between @xmath12 and the actual objective function @xmath13 .",
    "namely , it rotates @xmath12 toward @xmath13 and computes the vertices that optimize all the objective functions between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "a _ smoothed linear program _ is a linear program of the form ( lp ) , where the rows @xmath14 of @xmath7 , called the _ constraint vectors _ , and @xmath15 are independent gaussian random vectors , with arbitrary centers @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , and whose coordinates are independent normal random variables with standard deviations @xmath18 .",
    "spielman and teng proved    @xcite [ spielman - teng ] for arbitrary linear program with @xmath19 variables and @xmath20 constraints , the expected number of pivot steps in a two - phase shadow - vertex simplex method for the smoothed program is at most a polynomial @xmath21 .",
    "spielman - teng s analysis yields the following estimate on expected number of pivot steps : @xmath22 where the logarithmic factors are disregarded .",
    "the subsequent work of deshpande and spielman @xcite improved on the exponents of @xmath1 and @xmath23 ; however , it doubled the exponent of @xmath0 .",
    "another model of randomness , in which the directions of the inequalities in ( lp ) are chosen independently at random , was studied in the eighties @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a shadow - vertex simplex method solves such problems in @xmath24 expected number of pivot steps .",
    "note that this bound does not depend on the number of constraints @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is not clear whether reversion of the inequalities can be justified as a good model for typical linear problems .",
    "these results lead to the question  how does the smoothed complexity of the simplex method depend on the number of constraints @xmath0 ?",
    "unlike in the model with randomly reversed inequalities , the number of pivots steps in the smoothed analysis must be at least logarithmic in @xmath0 ( see below ) .    in this paper , we prove the first polylogarithmic upper bound :    [ main ] the expected number of pivot steps in theorem  [ spielman - teng ] is at most @xmath25    see theorem  [ main precise ] for a more precise estimate .",
    "so , the number of pivot steps is _ polylogarithmic in the number of constraints _ @xmath0 , while the previous known bounds were polynomial in @xmath0 .",
    "this bound goes in some sense beyond the classical hirsch conjecture on the diameter of polytopes , the maximal number of steps in the shortest walk between any pair of vertices ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hirsch conjecture states that the diameter of a polytope with @xmath0 faces in @xmath1 dimensions , and in particular of the feasible polytope of ( lp ) , is at most @xmath5 .",
    "hirsch conjecture is tight , so it would be natural to think of @xmath5 as a lower bound on the worst case complexity of _ any _ variant of the simplex method .",
    "theorem  [ main ] ( and theorem  [ section ] below ) claim that a random perturbation creates a much shorter path between a given pair of vertices .",
    "moreover , while hirsch conjecture does not suggest any algorithm for finding a short walk , the shadow - vertex simplex method already finds a much shorter walk !    one can wonder whether a random perturbation creates a short path between the vertices by destroying most of them .",
    "this is not so even in the average case , when @xmath7 is a matrix with i.i.d .",
    "gaussian entries .",
    "indeed , the expected number of vertices of the random polytope is asymptotic to @xmath26 ( @xcite , see @xcite ) .",
    "this bound is exponential in @xmath1 and sublinear but not polylogarithmic in @xmath0 , as theorem  [ main ] claims .    for @xmath27",
    ", the random polygon will have @xmath28 vertices , which is thus a lower bound on the number of pivot steps of ( any ) simplex algorithm .",
    "the smoothed complexity ( expected running time ) of the simplex method is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the time to make one pivot step under the shadow - vertex pivot rule .",
    "the dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath0 is at most linear , for one only needs to find an appropriate vector @xmath14 among the @xmath0 vectors to update the running vertex .",
    "however , for many well structured linear problems the exhaustive search over all @xmath14 is not necessary , which makes @xmath30 much smaller . in these cases ,",
    "theorem  [ main ] shows that _ the shadow - vertex simplex method can solve very large scale problems _ ( up to exponentially many constraints ) .",
    "the author is grateful to the referees for careful reading of the manuscript and many useful remarks and suggestions , which greatly improved the paper .",
    "our smoothed analysis of the simplex method is largely inspired by that of spielman and teng @xcite .",
    "we resolve a few conceptual difficulties that arise in @xcite , which eventually simplifies and improves the overall picture .",
    "first , we reduce an arbitrary linear program ( lp ) to a _ unit linear program _  the one for which @xmath31 . this is done by a simple interpolation .",
    "this observation is independent of any particular algorithm to solve linear programs",
    ".    an interpolation variable will be introduced , and ( lp ) will reduce to a unit program in dimension @xmath32 with constraint vectors of type @xmath33 .",
    "a simple but very useful consequence is that this reduction preserves the gaussian distribution of the constraints  if ( lp ) has independent gaussian constraints ( as the smoothed program does ) , then so does the reduced unit program .",
    "now that we have a unit linear program , it is best viewed in the polar perspective .",
    "the polar of the feasible set @xmath34 is the polytope @xmath35 the unit linear problem is then equivalent to finding @xmath36 , the facet of @xmath37 pierced by the ray @xmath38 . in the shadow - vertex simplex method , we assume that provides us with an initial objective vector @xmath12 and the initial @xmath39",
    ". then of the simplex method computes @xmath40 for all vectors @xmath41 in the plane @xmath42 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "specifically , it rotates @xmath41 from @xmath12 toward @xmath13 and updates @xmath40 by removing and adding one vertex to its basis , as it becomes necessary . at the end",
    ", it outputs @xmath36 .",
    "the number of pivot steps in the simplex method is bounded by the number of facets of @xmath37 the plane @xmath43 intersects .",
    "this is the _ size of the planar section of the random polytope _",
    "@xmath37 , the number of the edges of the polygon @xmath44 . under a hypothetical assumption that @xmath43 is fixed or is statistically independent of @xmath37 , the average size of @xmath44 is polynomial in the dimension @xmath1 and",
    "the reciprocal of the standard deviation @xmath23 and polylogarithmic in the number of vertices @xmath0 , see theorem  [ main section ] below .",
    "the main complication of the analysis in @xcite was that plane @xmath42 was also random , and moreover correlated with the random polytope @xmath37 .",
    "it is not clear how to find the initial vector @xmath12 independent of the polytope @xmath37 and , at the same time , in such a way that we know the facet of @xmath37 it pierces .",
    "thus the main problem rests in .",
    "none of the previously available methods in linear programming seem to effectively overcome this difficulty .",
    "the randomized proposed in @xcite exposed a random facet of @xmath37 by multiplying a random @xmath1-subset of the vectors @xmath14 by an appropriately big constant to ensure that these vectors do span a facet .",
    "then a random convex linear combination of these vectors formed the initial vector @xmath12 .",
    "this approach brings about two complications :    \\(a ) the vertices of the new random polytope are no longer gaussian ;    \\(b ) the initial objective vector @xmath12 ( thus also the plane @xmath43 ) is correlated with the random polytope .",
    "our new approach will overcome both these difficulties .",
    "we propose the following randomized for arbitrary unit linear programs .",
    "it is of independent interest , regardless of its applications to smoothed analysis and to the simplex method .    instead of finding or exposing a facet of @xmath37 , we _",
    "add a facet _ to @xmath37 in a random direction .",
    "we need to ensure that this facet falls into the _",
    "numb set _ of the linear program , which consists of the points that do not change the solution when added to the set of constraint vectors @xmath45 . since the solution of the linear program is @xmath36 , the affine half - space below the affine span of @xmath36 ( on the same side as the origin )",
    "is contained in the numb set .",
    "thus _ the numb set always contains a half - space_.    a random vector @xmath12 drawn from the uniform distribution on the sphere @xmath46 is then in the numb half - space with probability at least @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , a standard concentration of measure argument shows that such a random point is at distance @xmath48 from the boundary of the numb half - space , with constant probability .",
    "( this distance is the _ observable diameter _ of the sphere , see @xcite section  1.4 ) .",
    "thus a small regular simplex with center @xmath12 is also in the numb set with constant probability .",
    "similarly , one can smooth the vertices of the simplex ( make them gaussian ) without leaving the numb set . finally , to ensure that such simplex will form a facet of the new polytope",
    ", it suffices to dilate it by the factor @xmath49 .",
    "summarizing , _ we can add @xmath1 linear constraints to any linear program at random , without changing its solution with constant probability_.    note that it is easy to check whether the solution is correct , i.e. that the added constraints do not affect the solution .",
    "the latter happens if and only if none of the added constraints turn into equalities on the solution @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , one can repeatedly solve the linear program with different sets of added constraints generated independently , until the solution is correct .",
    "because of a constant probability of success at every step , this terminates after an expected constant number of steps , and it always produces a correct initial solution .",
    "when applied for the smoothed analysis of the simplex method , this resolves one of the main difficulties of the approach in @xcite .",
    "the initial objective vector @xmath12 and thus the plane @xmath43 become independent of the random polytope @xmath37 .",
    "thus _ the smoothed complexity of the simplex method gets bounded by the number of edges of a planar section of a random polytope @xmath37 _ , whose vertices have standard deviation of order @xmath50 , see .",
    "in the previous approach @xcite , such reduction was made with the standard deviation of order @xmath51 .",
    "a _ deterministic _ is also possible , along the same lines .",
    "we have used that a random point in @xmath46 is at distance @xmath48 from a half - space .",
    "the same property is clearly satisfied by at least one element of the set @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the canonical basis of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , at least one of @xmath1 regular simplices of radius @xmath55 centered at points @xmath56 , lies in the numb half - space .",
    "one can try them all for added constraints ; at least one will give a correct solution .",
    "this however will increase the running time by a factor of @xmath1  the number of trials in this deterministic may be as large as @xmath1 , while the expected number of trials in the randomized is constant .",
    "the smoothed analysis with such will also become more difficult due to having @xmath1 non - random vertices .      to complete the smoothed analysis of the simplex algorithm , it remains to bound the size ( i.e. the number of edges ) of the section @xmath44 of a randomly perturbed polytope @xmath37 with a fixed plane @xmath43 .",
    "spielman and teng proved the first polynomial bound on this size .",
    "we improve it to a polylogarithmic bound in the number of vertices @xmath0 :    [ main section ] let @xmath57 be independent gaussian vectors in @xmath54 with centers of norm at most @xmath58 , and with standard deviation @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a plane in @xmath54 .",
    "then the random polytope @xmath59 satisfies @xmath60    see theorem  [ section ] for a slightly more precise result .",
    "spielman and teng obtained a weaker estimate @xmath61 for this size ( @xcite theorem  4.0.1 ) .",
    "a loss of the factor of @xmath0 in their argument occurs in estimating the angle of incidence ( @xcite lemma  4.2.1 ) , the angle at which a fixed ray in @xmath43 emitted from the origin meets the facet of @xmath37 it pierces .    instead of estimating the angle of incidence from one viewpoint determined by the origin @xmath62",

    "we have thus reduced the problem to _ estimating the distance of a fixed point to the boundary of a random simplex , conditioned on the event that the point lies in that simplex_.    the main difficulty is that the distance is angular rather than euclidean ; the latter is easier to estimate .",
    "unfortunately , the two distances may be very different .",
    "this happens if the _ angle of incidence _  the angle at which the direction of @xmath41 meets the subspace @xmath266  is too small .",
    "so spielman and teng needed to show that the angle of incidence is at least of order @xmath268 with high probability ( section  4.2 in @xcite ) ; consequently , the angular and euclidean distances are within a factor @xmath269 from each other .    in this paper , we can not tolerate the loss of a factor of @xmath0 since we are proving a complexity estimate that is polylogarithmic rather than polynomial in @xmath0 .",
    "we will now present a simple way to avoid such a loss .      instead of estimating the angle of incidence from one viewpoint determined by the origin @xmath62 , we will _ view the polytope @xmath270 from three different points _ @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 on @xmath43 .",
