    "the last decade brought a dynamic evolution of the computing capabilities of graphics processing units ( gpus ) . in that time , the performance of a single card increased from tens of gflops in nvxx to tflops in the newest kepler / maxwell nvidia chips  @xcite .",
    "this raw processing power did not go unnoticed by the engineering and science communities , which started applying gpus to accelerate a wide array of calculations in what became known as gpgpu  general - purpose computing on gpus .",
    "this led to the development of special gpu variants optimized for high performance computing ( e.g. the nvidia tesla line ) , but it should be noted that even commodity graphics cards , such as those from the nvidia geforce series , still provide enormous computational power and can be a very economical ( both from the monetary and energy consumption point of view ) alternative to large cpu clusters .",
    "the spread of gpgpu techniques was further facilitated by the development of cuda and opencl ",
    "parallel programming paradigms allowing efficient exploitation of the available gpu compute power without exposing the programmer to too many low - level details of the underlying hardware .",
    "gpus were used successfully to accelerate many problems , e.g. the numerical solution of stochastic differential equations  @xcite , fluid simulations with the lattice boltzmann method  @xcite , molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite , classical  @xcite and quantum monte carlo  @xcite simulations , exact diagonalization of the hubbard model  @xcite , _",
    "etc_.    parallel computing in general , and its realization in gpus in particular , can also be extremely useful in many fields of solid state physics . for a large number of problems , the ground state of the system and its free energy",
    "are of special interest .",
    "for instance , in order to determine the phase diagram of a model , free energy has to be calculated for a large number of points in the parameter space . in this paper",
    ", we address this very issue and illustrate it on a concrete example of a superconducting system with an oscillating order parameter ( op ) , specifically an iron - based multi - band superconductor ( fesc ) .",
    "our algorithm is not limited to systems of this type and can also be used for systems in the homogeneous superconducting state ( bcs ) .",

    "@xcite a consequence of this is a more sensitive dependence of the fs to doping .",
    "@xcite in the superconducting state , the gap is found to be on the order of 10 mev , small relative to the breadth of the band .",
    "@xcite this increases the required accuracy of calculated physical quantities needed to determine the phase diagram of the superconducting state , such as free energy .",
