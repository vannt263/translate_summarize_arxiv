    "following previous work @xcite , the multiplicity distribution ( md ) generating function in the dummy variable @xmath0 , @xmath1 has been recognised to be related to the grand canonical partition function of a system of @xmath2 particles in statistical mechanics when @xmath0 is identified with the fugacity variable ; @xmath3 is here the probability of detecting @xmath2 charged particles in full phase space ( @xmath4 ) and it is linked to the canonical partition function .",
    "it has to be stressed that in a realistic experiment @xmath2 will never become infinity .",
    "let us call @xmath5 the maximum finite value of @xmath2 which can be detected in an experiment .",

    "recall that the @xmath5-truncated generating function ( as any polynomial ) can be factorised in terms of its roots as follows : @xmath11    by applying these considerations to phase transitions of a lattice gas ( and of the ising model ) , c.n .",
    "yang and t.d .",
    "lee @xcite have found that the roots @xmath9 lie on a circle centered at the origin of the complex @xmath0-plane .",
    "the circle is open in a small sector bisected by the positive real axis ; no zero lies in that sector .",
    "when @xmath5 is odd , at least one root is real : it will of course be on the negative side .",
    "@xmath12 turns out to be an analytic function along the positive real axis for any @xmath5 .",
    "a phase transition in the sense of a non analytic behaviour of the thermodynamical functions ( like pressure for instance ) can only occur at points of the positive real @xmath0 axis which are `` in the thermodynamical limit '' accumulation points of the zeroes of the algebraic equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) . for @xmath13",
    ", one should expect in general that the zeroes become closer and closer to the real positive axis and that the distance between the zeroes vanishes .",
    "the first application of these ideas to particle production goes back to the 70 s @xcite , but the field flourished again ( results were obtained in the context a discrete approximation to qcd cascades @xcite ) in 1995 , when e.  de wolf @xcite studied , using the jetset monte carlo generator , the zeroes of the generating function of the @xmath2-charged particle multiplicity distribution in @xmath14 annihilation in the @xmath15-rapidity interval @xmath16 at 1000 gev c.m .",
    "the zeroes were found to lie on a circle of approximately unit radius centered at the origin of the complex @xmath0-plane .",
    "intriguing questions were also raised on the development of this approach in different models and in different classes of events .    after recalling and extending the main theorems on the subject",
    ", the present paper explores the properties of the distribution of zeroes in high energy collisions in the framework of the weighted superposition mechanism of different classes of events : each class is described by a negative binomial ( pascal ) md , whose characteristic parameters are @xmath17 , the average charged particle multiplicity , and @xmath18 , linked to the dispersion @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",

    "we propose in this section to apply the previously discussed theorems and remarks to the study , in the rescaled complex @xmath0-plane ( i.e. , in the complex @xmath47-plane ) , of maps of zeroes of the algebraic equations obtained by truncating at integer value @xmath5 the nb ( pascal ) md generating function .",
    "this distribution is used in a statistical model of multiparticle production to describe different classes of events ( or substructures ) in different collisions .",
    "these substructures are for instance 2- and 3-jets events in @xmath14 annihilation or events without mini - jets ( soft events ) and with mini - jets ( semi - hard events ) in pp collisions .",
    "recently @xcite , in pp collisions , the occurrence of a third class of hard events at 14 tev c.m .",
    "energy has been postulated also in the framework of the weighted superposition mechanism of different classes of events , each described by a nb ( pascal ) md with characteristic nb parameters .",
    "the occurrence of this third class of events was motivated by the fact that , by assuming both strong kno scaling violations and qcd behaviour , extrapolations of nb parameters in the lhc energy domain implied , in the semi - hard sample of events , a surprising reduction in the average number of clans @xcite .    in order to deepen the analysis of the properties of collective variables in terms of the maps of complex zeroes and in order to study the possible occurrence of a phase transition , we focus our attention on the three mentioned classes of events at 14 tev c.m .",
    "energy in pp collisions . accordingly , the nb parameters used in the following are those described in @xcite : @xmath106 @xmath107 .",
    "we find that for the soft and semi - hard components , the parameter @xmath18 is greater than one and the zeroes stay _ inside _ the circle of unit radius in the complex @xmath47-plane ( see figures 1a and 1b ) . for the hard component ,",
    "the parameter @xmath18 is smaller than one and all the zeroes lie _ outside _ the circle of unit radius @xmath108 ( see figure 1c ) . in order to make our statements more transparent , in figures 2a , 2b , 2c the behaviour of the three classes of events in the region around the point",
    "@xmath59 has been magnified for different cut - offs but fixed value of @xmath18 . in figure 3",
    "the above maps are shown together close to the point @xmath59 , with the same fixed cut - off for three values of @xmath18 corresponding to the three classes of events .",
    "notice that for @xmath72 all the zeroes stay on the circle of unit radius with the @xmath59 point excluded .",
    "in addition , when @xmath13 the distribution of the zeroes of the algebraic equation obtained from the truncated and rescaled generating function converges towards the @xmath59 point for all classes of events with both @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in order to test the occurrence of a phase transition one has to find the behaviour of the zeroes of the grand canonical partition function @xmath111 in the thermodynamical limit , i.e. , with the size of the system going to infinity .",
    "the discussion is based on the approach contained in @xcite , where the generating function @xmath6 has been related to @xmath111 by @xmath112^{-1}.      \\label{eq:28}\\ ] ] relation ( [ eq:28 ] ) implies that the zeroes of the @xmath5-truncated grand canonical partition function @xmath113 can be obtained from the zeroes of the @xmath5-truncated generating function @xmath114 simply by rescaling those zeroes by a factor @xmath98 ( which was identified in @xcite it should be stressed again with the fugacity ) .",
    "the behaviour of the zeroes will then depend on the volume and the number of particles : when the md is of nb type , as we are using now , it is sufficient to know the behaviour of the nb parameters . at present however , a realistic link between @xmath18 and @xmath17 and the system size ( the volume ) is under investigation , hence postponed to a forthcoming paper . here",
    "we limit ourselves to explore what happens when the thermodynamical limit corresponds to @xmath5 ( and @xmath17 ) going to infinity with @xmath18 fixed . in the first place we will check whether the ek theorem can be used to confine the zeroes to a narrowing region of the complex plane .",
    "recalling eq .",
    "( [ eq:18 ] ) , we notice that for @xmath72 one has @xmath67=\\frac{1}{b}$ ] .",
    "thus minimum and maximum radii coincide and all the zeroes of @xmath12 lie on a circle of radius @xmath115 , independently of the chosen cut - off @xmath5 .",
    "numerical studies show that the opening around the positive real axis is reduced when @xmath13 ; this suggests that @xmath54 is an accumulation point of zeroes .",
    "it means of course that in this scenario for @xmath72 , the point @xmath59 is an accumulation point of zeroes of the grand canonical partition function : since @xmath47 on the real axis coincides with the fugacity , only for @xmath116 will a phase transition take place .",
    "for @xmath109 the zeroes of the grand canonical partition function obey the following relation @xmath66=\\frac{1}{k } \\leq | u | \\leq r[n_{\\max}]=\\frac{m+1}{m+k }      \\label{eq:29}\\ ] ] while for @xmath110 the two limits are exchanged .",
    "such a region does not shrink .",
    "we have to rely again on numerical root - finding , which still indicates the closing in of the zeroes to @xmath59 ( see figures 1 and figures 2 ) , and at the same time shows that they are much closer together than the bound given by relation ( [ eq:29 ] ) allows .",
    "this feature again points in the direction of the presence of a possible phase transition at @xmath116 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the use of the rescaled complex variable @xmath117 marks visibly the different behaviour of the map of zeroes of the hard class of events with respect to the maps of the soft and semi - hard ones in our statistical model .",
    "in addition , it leads to identify the coefficients @xmath60}$ ] of eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) with the canonical partition function for a system of @xmath2 particles , and @xmath118 with the truncated grand canonical partition function of the same system ( in this framework @xmath119 , i.e. , the parameter @xmath18 coincides with the canonical partition function for a system with one particle , see also @xcite ) .",
    "it should also be pointed out that in the rescaled version of this approach the nb parameter @xmath18 alone controls the geometry of the distribution of the zeroes .",
    "this is indeed a quite general property which is expected to be valid also in other collisions and especially in those collisions involving events with large numbers of particles , like heavy ion collisions .",
    "finally , it has been shown that the nb parameter @xmath18 is equal to minus the sum of the inverse of the zeroes , independently of the value of the cut - off @xmath5 .",
    "all these facts suggest to investigate further the thermodynamical content of the nb parameter @xmath18 , and especially its dependence on temperature and volume , in view of a possible phase transition in the @xmath116 limit .",
    "being indeed the fugacity @xmath120 ( with @xmath121 the chemical potential ) , one finds that @xmath121 goes to 0 in the limit @xmath116 : this is a situation which is reached in a high temperature and high density real boson gas and which is expected to occur in a quark - gluon plasma .",
