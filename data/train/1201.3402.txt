    "the presence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in our universe is now well established by a number of observational experiments , especially the very precise measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment @xcite .",
    "the measured value of the cdm relic density is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath3 km / mpc / s .",
    "though the gravitation nature of the dark matter ( dm ) is commonly believed to be well established , its particle nature remains alluring except that it is nonbaryonic and to a high extent electrically neutral .",
    "one of the most appealing and natural cdm particle candidates is the _ weakly - interacting massive particle _ ( wimp ) .",
    "if the dark matter , generically denoted by @xmath4 here , is thermally produced in the early universe , the required annihilation cross section is right at the order of weak interaction .",
    "there may be a dynamical connection between the dark matter and weak - scale physics .",
    "the relation between the fractional relic density of @xmath4 relative to the critical density and its thermal annihilation cross section can be given by the following simple formula @xcite @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the annihilation cross section of the dark matter around the time of freeze - out , at which the annihilation rate could no longer catch up with the hubble expansion rate of the universe .",
    "assuming the measured @xmath7 to be saturated by a single component wimp , its annihilation cross section should be about @xmath8 pb or @xmath9 .",
    "this is exactly the size of the cross section that one expects from a weak interaction process , which implies an appreciable size of production rate of the wimp at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) as well as the event rates for direct and indirect searches that reach the sensitivities of dark matter experiments like xenon100 @xcite and @xmath10-lat @xcite respectively .",
    "there have been many proposed candidates for the dark matter . without committing to any particular dm model",
    "so as to perform a model independent analysis , we adopt an effective interaction approach to describe the interactions of the dark matter particle with the standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "recently , there have been a number of works in this approach that deals with different observable signals in various experiments @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one simple realization of the effective interaction approach is that the dark matter particle exists in a hidden sector , which communicates to the sm sector via a heavy degree of freedom in the connector sector . at energy scale well below this heavy mediator",
    "the interactions can be conveniently described by a set of effective interactions .",
    "the strength of each interaction depends on the nature of the dark matter particle and the mediator .",
    "a few models that can give rise to some of the operators in this analysis are described in the appendix .",
    "however , note that some popular dark matter models , such as supersymmetry , can not be correctly described by this effective - interaction appraoch , because the dark matter particles themselves also experience the sm interactions . in this work",
    ", we will consider various spin nature of the dark matter particle including dirac and majorana for fermionic dark matter , as well as real and complex scalar .",
    "the most important set of interactions among the fermionic dark matter @xmath4 and the light fermions @xmath11 are described by the effective operators @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are general dirac matrices contracted with appropriate lorentz indices .",
    "we will discuss these and other operators in more details in the next section .",
    "one of the most anticipated signals of dark matter at hadronic colliders is a large missing energy in association with jets , photons , or leptons , such as monojet and monophoton plus large missing - energy signatures .",
    "for example , if we take one of the operators , @xmath15 , and attach a gluon or a photon to a quark leg , it will give rise to a monojet or a monophoton plus missing energy event . the tevatron experiments and the lhc experiments",
    "have been actively searching for these signatures in some other context , such as large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "we will use the most updated data on monojet and monophoton production from the lhc @xcite and the tevatron @xcite to constrain each effective operator .",
    "it turns out that the limits from the lhc and tevatron are comparable to those obtained from indirect detection data ( pamela @xcite and @xmath0-lat @xcite ) , but inferior to those obtained from direct detection data ( xenon100 @xcite and cdms @xcite ) if a particular operator contributes to spin - independent cross sections .",
    "some recent works in this direction have been in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo gives rise to a number of observable signals , including excess in positron flux , antiproton flux , and gamma - ray over the corresponding cosmic backgrounds .",
    "the most current positron flux and antiproton flux data come from pamela @xcite .",
    "the positron - fraction spectrum showed an uprising trend up to about 100 gev @xcite .-",
    "lat @xcite showed that the uprising trend continues to about 150 gev . ] nevertheless , the antiproton flux is consistent with the expected cosmic background @xcite .",
    "the effective operators such as @xmath16 can give rise to dark matter annihilation into light quarks , which will eventually hadronize into antiprotons .",
    "in refs .",
    "@xcite the effects of dark matter annihilation on positron flux and antiproton flux were studied .",
    "it was shown that the antiproton flux data can give a better constraint on the effective dark matter interactions than the positron flux data @xcite .",
    "so in this work we focus on antiproton flux data when we use antimatter search experiments to constrain the effective dark matter interactions .",
    "another powerful set of indirect detection data comes from the gamma ray due to dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo .",
    "the data from the extragalactic sources contain large uncertainties , such that we concentrate on the galactic data in this work .",
    "currently , the best data come from the @xmath0-lat experiment @xcite .",
    "it detects gamma rays in sub - gev region to hundreds of gev from all directions @xmath17 , i.e. , including galactic center ( gc ) @xmath18 , low - latitude @xmath19 , mid - latitude @xmath20 , and high latitude @xmath21 .",
    "the data on the photon spectrum from the low - latitude @xmath22 @xcite recorded by the @xmath10-lat indicated a continuous spectrum and mostly consistent with the known backgrounds .",
    "we can therefore use the data to constrain on additional sources of gamma - ray , namely , the annihilation of the dark matter into quarks , followed by fragmentation into neutral pions , which further decay into photons .",
    "some recent works in using the @xmath0-lat to constrain various models or effective dark matter interactions can be found in refs .",
    ".    another important method of detecting dm is through the direct collision between the dm particles in the halo with the nuclei of the detecting materials .",
    "the dm particles then lose a fraction of the kinetic energy to the nuclei , which can be detected by a phonon - type or scintillation - type or ionization - type signal or some combinations of these types .",
    "since the energy transfer is only of order @xmath23 kev and the event rate is extremely low , an almost background - free environment is needed .",
    "the most recent result comes from the xenon100 collaboration @xcite , which did not see any signal events and obtained limits on the spin - independent ( si ) cross sections versus the dm mass .",
    "the 90% cl upper limit on @xmath24 for @xmath25 gev .",
    "we are going to use the limits presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to constrain the effective operators .    in this work",
    ", we are going to constrain each operator from the combined data sets on relic density ( wmap ) , direct detection ( xenon , zeplin and simple ) , cosmic antiproton flux ( pamela ) , cosmic gamma - ray flux ( @xmath0-lat ) , and monojet and monophoton production ( tevatron and lhc ) .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows .",
    "we describe the set of effective operators for fermionic and scalar dm and describe their nonrelativistic limits in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the relic density assuming production of dm from the thermal equilibrium and by solving the boltzmann equation . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate both the spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) cross sections and constrain each operator by the xenon100 @xcite , xenon10 @xcite , zeplin @xcite , and simple @xcite data . in sec .",
    "v and vi , we calculate the cosmic antiproton and gamma - ray flux , respectively , and constrain each operator from the most current data . in sec .",
    "vii , we calculate monojet and monophoton production at the tevatron and lhc , and use the most current data to constrain each operator . in sec .",
    "viii , we perform a combined analysis by adding the chi - square of each data set .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "before we close this introduction section we would spell out the improvements that are achieved in this work .    1 .",
    "the constraint from the lhc monojet and monophoton production was only recently done in refs .",
    "we perform an independent analysis here .",
    "we perform a full calculation of the relic density by solving the boltzmann equation .",
    "3 .   in the spin - dependent cross sections ,",
    "we include data sets from xenon10 @xcite , zeplin @xcite , and simple @xcite .",
    "we combine all data sets in the combined analysis .",
    "the resulting limits will be the most stringent so far .",
    "based on these improvements and by demanding an operator not to give too much relic density to the universe and satisfying the current experimental constraints from direct and indirect detection , and from collider data , a vast number of effective dm operators are indeed ruled out .",
    "the conclusion obtained here is important for building an effective model for the dark matter .",
    "for simplicity , we will assume there is only one component of dark matter denoted by @xmath4 and it is a standard model singlet . here",
    "the @xmath4 can stand for a dirac or majorana fermion , real or complex scalar , depending on the context .",
    "also , @xmath11 stands for a sm fermion , including quarks and leptons .",
    "we will include all quarks and leptons in our analysis .",
    "we briefly discuss in the appendix a few hidden - sector models that can give rise to some of the operators used in this work in certain limits . for dark matter of spin 1 and spin 3/2",
    ", the reader may refer to the works in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first set of operators that we consider is for fermionic dm .",
    "its effective interactions with a pair of fermions include vector- , axial - vector , or tensor - type exchanges , given by the following dimension 6 operators @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the heavy mass scale for the connector sector that has been integrated out and @xmath28 is an effective coupling constant of order @xmath29 that can be absorbed into @xmath27 .",
    "it is understood that for majorana fermion the vector and tensor structures are absent .",
    "next set of operators are for fermionic dm associated with ( pseudo ) scalar - type exchange @xmath30 the @xmath31 dependence in the coupling strength is included for scalar - type interactions because this factor appears naturally from dark matter models with scalar exchange diagrams .",
    "another light degree of freedom that couples to the fermionic dark matter is the gluon field @xmath32 for operators involving gluons , the factor of strong coupling constant @xmath33 is also included because these operators are induced at one loop level and evaluated at the scale @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the dark matter mass . finally , we also write down the corresponding operators for complex scalar dm .",
    "@xmath36 we note that for real scalar dark matter the vector couplings in eqs.([l15 ] ) and ( [ l16 ] ) are absent . in",
    "what follows , we simply focus on the complex scalar dark matter .",
    "note also that we have redefined the coefficients of some of the operators , which are different from our previous works @xcite , such that they can conform with the normalization for the nucleon matrix elements used in the literature for the direct detection experiments .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that in the calculation of the annihilation cross section for the dm relic density , the relative importance of each operator can be understood by considering the nonrelativistic expansion of the operator and studying the velocity dependence .",
    "we briefly review this matter here for convenience . in the nonrelativistic limit ,",
    "the spinors for the dirac dm @xmath4 and @xmath37 annihilation are @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two - components pauli spinors and @xmath42 .",
    "we can expand @xmath43 as @xmath44 where the spatial components are not suppressed by @xmath45 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath46 in the nonrelativistic limit are @xmath47 where the spatial components are now suppressed by @xmath45 .",
    "it is clear that in the nonrelativistic limit the time and spatial components of the vector and axial vector bilinear behave very differently .",
    "we can then consider them separately when it is contracted with the trace of the light fermion leg .",
    "if we look at the trace of @xmath48 or @xmath49 in the annihilation amplitude , the time component part after being squared gives a quantity close to zero , while the spatial component part gives a quantity in the order of @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , it is clear now that @xmath43 multiplied to @xmath51 or @xmath52 will not be suppressed , while @xmath46 multiplied to @xmath51 or @xmath52 will always be suppressed .",
    "therefore , the operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 can contribute to annihilation much more than the operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "all the other operators can be understood similarly @xcite . from ref.@xcite",
    ", we knew that some of the operators are doubly suppressed by the velocity of the dark matter combined with either a light fermion mass or strong coupling constant .",
    "note that some of the lower limits that we obtained before are relative low compared to the dark matter mass . in such cases , one may question the validity of the effective interaction approach .",
    "the physics behind is easy to understand .",
    "the effects of such operators are very suppressed because of the small velocity suppression or helicity suppression , not because of the size of the @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath57 has to be small enough in order to see an effect from these operators .",
    "we argue that the effective momentum transfer of such velocity - suppressed operators should be @xmath58 . with @xmath59 for the dm velocity at the present epoch , as long as the ratio @xmath60 remains small , we expect the effective interaction approach can still be valid .",
    "the above effective operators are relativistically invariant and therefore appropriate for the calculation in the relic density of the dark matter and its implication at collider physics .",
    "however , for direct detection experiments , we need to have a nonrelativistic reduction of these operators since the local dark matter velocity in the halo is of order @xmath59 .",
    "it is straightforward to demonstrate in the nonrelativistic limit only eight operators are relevant for the direct detections .",
    "these are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "one can further show that only @xmath53 , @xmath56 and @xmath69 are independent , since we have the following nonrelativistic reduction @xmath70 in table  [ prop ] we summarize some of the features of the operators discussed in this section . at decoupling time ,",
    "@xmath71 and hence non - relativistic reduction is no longer applicable . the velocity scaling behaviours for each operator shown in the last column of table  [ prop ] for the annihilation cross sections are just merely serving the purpose to illustrate the physics . for our numerical work ,",
    "we use the full expressions for the annihilation cross sections presented at the appendix .    in our analysis in the following sections",
    ", we will treat one operator at a time .",
    "this working assumption of treating one operator at one time may seem unreasonable .",
    "however it is a matter of choosing between controlling the number of parameters and the assumptions involved .",
    "if we treat each sm favor separately , then one operator at a time would mean the dm only couples to one quark ( say @xmath72 quark ) but not to the other ( say @xmath73 quark ) .",
    "it would be very strange that the new physics only couples to up quark but not to the others .",
    "but if we take more than one operators at the same time , the number of parameters will grow out of control in such an analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "we have summed over all sm fermions for each operator .",
    "the quantum numbers of the new interaction for the sm fermions could be very different from one another .",
    "it is entirely model dependent .",
    "there would be too many parameters if we treat them all different .",
    "even if we assumed different coefficients for each sm generation , we would still introduce more parameters . here in this work ,",
    "we take the _ democratic _",
    "choice such that the coefficient for each sm fermion is of the same order , and we have treated them the same .",
    "therefore , we sum over all sm fermions in each operator .",
    "we also note that the effective operators studied here in this work do not address the issue of gauge invariance .",
    "imposing @xmath74 gauge invariance for the sm fermions would impose certain relations among operators and hence their coefficients .",
    "certain operators like those with an explicit factor of sm fermion mass @xmath31 breaking @xmath74 invariance explicitly can be made covariant by introducing the higgs field .",

    "if there are more than one operators exist at the same time , then the lower limit obtained by all the detection experiments ( collider , indirect , and direct ) will be stronger ; on the other hand , the upper limit due to the relic density will be weaker .",
    "therefore , there would be more allowable regions . also note that if we further extends to larger masses for @xmath35 in almost all of the operators , there could be some allowed regions .",
    "since we have performed the analysis for each experimental data set and the combined analysis , we can easily see which data set dominates for each operator .",
    "they are summarized as follows .",
    "* dominated by direct detection : @xmath209 * by collider : @xmath210 * by indirect detection ( @xmath211 and @xmath212-ray ) : @xmath213 * by collider at low @xmath35 and direct detection at high @xmath35 : @xmath65 * by collider at low @xmath35 and indirect detection at high @xmath35 : @xmath202 * by indirect detection at low @xmath35 and direct detection at high @xmath35 : @xmath68    the operators @xmath55 , @xmath201 , and @xmath205 that have allowed regions of parameter space are dominantly constrained by the collider data only .",
    "this is because these operators in the nonrelativistic limit ( e.g. the present universe ) are highly suppressed and thus can not contribute at any significant level to direct and indirect detection .    in this work",
    ", we have exhausted all recent experimental data sets from wmap7 , direct / indirect detection , gamma - ray flux , antiproton flux and collider to obtain important constraints on the effective interactions of the dark matter with the sm particles .",
    "we found that almost all effective operators , except for @xmath55 , @xmath201 , and @xmath205 , can not give a smaller interaction that was constrained by the direct and indirect detection as well as collider data , while at the same time provide a large enough interaction required by the wmap7 data for the relic density to avoid the universe over closed by the dm .",
    "the result has interesting implications to model buildings , especially those with a heavy mediator between the dark sector and the sm sector",
    ". a lot of possibilities shown in this work will not work if we allow at the same time the new physics to give a thermal relic density and to be consistent with the existing data from direct and indirect detections as well as collider data .",
    "we thank eiko yu and joel heinrich for a discussion on treatment of data .",

    "the darkon model @xcite consists of a real - scalar boson @xmath214 , which is hidden from the sm interactions , except for a higgs - portal type interaction with the sm higgs boson @xmath215 after the higgs field develops a vev @xmath216 , the interactions between the physical higgs boson and the darkon are given by @xmath217 such that the interactions of the darkon @xmath214 proceed via the higgs boson .",
    "we can write down the amplitude for @xmath218 as @xmath219 in the limit @xmath220 , the amplitude becomes @xmath221 where @xmath222 .",
    "this is very similar to the operator @xmath67 in the case of a real scalar dm , with the explicit @xmath31 dependence .",
    "the hidden sector consists of a fermion @xmath4 as the dm and a scalar boson @xmath223 , which can mix with the sm higgs field @xmath77 : @xmath224 the amplitude for @xmath225 , after boson mixing , is given by @xmath226 which becomes , in the limit @xmath227 , @xmath228 which is exactly the same as @xmath69 with the explicit dependence on @xmath31 .",
    "the hidden sector consists of a fermionic dm @xmath4 and a gauge boson @xmath229 , which then mixes with the sm @xmath96 boson via the kinetic mixing or stueckelberg - type mixing @xcite .",
    "the hidden sector does not have any sm interactions originally , but via the mixing with the sm @xmath96 boson , some level of interactions with the sm particles is possible .",
    "suppose the interactions of the dm @xmath4 and the sm fermions are given by , after mixing and integrating out the heavy @xmath229 boson , @xmath230 then the amplitude for the process @xmath225 can be written as @xmath231 in the limit of @xmath232 , the amplitude becomes @xmath233 the couplings of the @xmath96 boson to the sm fermions are all of the same order and the coupling to @xmath4 is unknown , we can , to a crude approximation , take the overall couplings to be similar .",
    "thus , we arrive at the operators @xmath53 to @xmath56 .",
    "note that the coefficients for different sm fermions may as well be different , though they are highly model dependent , they should not differ from one another too much . again",
    ", we take the crude approximation that they are similar and thus reduce a large number of parameters .    a more thorough discussion on deriving various effective operators from various particle exchanges can be found in ref .",
