    "the point vortex model , originally developed by kirchoff @xcite as a limiting form of euler s equations in two - dimensions , continues to provide a conceptual and computational tool for understanding inviscid , nonlinear vortex dynamics in both traditional and superfluid turbulence ( @xcite ) .",
    "the multi - body hamiltonian describing the dynamics of idealized point vortices serves as a paradigm for developing kinetic theories in systems dominated by long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "the statistical mechanics of point vortex systems was first addressed in the seminal work of onsager @xcite who observed that in a finite domain , the hamiltonian structure of a system of sufficiently large numbers of positive and negative vortices implies the existence of ` negative temperature ' equilibrium states which naturally exhibit clustering of like - signed vortices @xcite .",
    "s statistical approach has inspired a wealth of subsequent work on vortex - based , mean - field turbulence closures @xcite and the existence of negative temperature states has been interpreted ( e.g. @xcite ) as an energy - conserving analog of self - organization via ` vortex merger ' commonly observed in two - dimensional turbulence @xcite . to date , however , direct connections between onsager s equilibrium prediction for the inviscid point - vortex system and the up - scaling , inverse - energy cascade in two - dimensional navier - stokes turbulence have proved elusive .",
    "underpinning the equilibrium statistical mechanics approach are the assumptions that the system is both energy isolated ( inviscid ) and ergodic , namely that as @xmath4 , the system samples all possible configurations on a fixed energy surface . while the inviscid assumption is clearly violated by navier - stokes vortices , two - dimensional turbulence cascades energy to the largest scales where viscous effects are less pronounced .",
    "in addition , as long as the relaxation to equilibrium of the inviscid system takes place on time - scales much shorter than those imposed by viscosity , the equilibrium statistics of the inviscid model should approximate those of the full system on these timescales @xcite .",
    "ergodicity of point - vortex systems remains an open issue .",
    "the assumption was questioned by onsager @xcite and repeatedly since @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we directly examine both ergodicity and the connection between equilibrium statistical properties and dynamic kinetic energy cascades for two - dimensional point - vortex systems on the unit sphere @xcite .",
    "the sphere has the distinct advantage of providing a bounded domain without the complications of imposing explicit boundary conditions via image particles ( infinitely many for doubly - periodic domains ) . despite its apparent attraction ,",
    "there has been relatively little work addressing the statistical mechanics of point vortices on the sphere .",
    "recently , for spherical systems with skewed distributions of vortex strengths , kiessling & wang ( 2012 ) @xcite proved convergence to continuous solutions of euler s equations .",
    "the scaling limits considered , however , assume the existence of large - scale mean flows and thus have singular structure in the zero mean , zero angular momentum limit .",
    "in closer analogy with turbulence studies , we study fluctuations in zero angular momentum states of binary populations of vortices with zero mean circulation ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the kinetic energy spectrum of flows induced by such systems scales as @xmath3 , for sufficiently large degree ( or wavenumber ) @xmath5 , independent of the system energy .",
    "as onsager conjectured , increasing the energy of the system necessarily increases the kinetic energy content at the largest allowable scales .",
    "however , comparisons of microcanonical and time averaged two - point statistics show clear evidence of ergodicity in the vortex dynamics implying that the direction of any dynamic spectral evolution depends solely on the shape of the initial spectrum relative to the ensemble mean . therefore ,",

    "therefore , the observed difference in relaxation timescales can not be explained simply by differences between dipole collision rates in the two systems .",

    "particle exchange collisions are clearly evident in the dilute case ( @xmath104 , upper panel ) where individual pair energies spike to zero before consistently returning to the negative energy level associated with their initial separations .",
    "two dipoles pairs repeat this process more than 5 times in the first 10 time units .",
    "the time distribution of pairwise energies is bimodal , highly concentrated at @xmath118 and 0 .",
    "by contrast , initial pairs in the @xmath35 case are rapidly scattered and information about the interaction energy of the initial configuration is quickly lost .",
    "this is true not only for the 4 selected dipole pairs shown here , but for all pairs in the @xmath35 case .     and ( lower panel ) 4 initial dipoles in the @xmath119 case.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ] +   and ( lower panel ) 4 initial dipoles in the @xmath119 case.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "due to the universal @xmath3 behavior of point - vortex kinetic energy spectra at small scales , increasing the system energy preferentially increases the kinetic energy content at the largest allowable scales .",
    "while this is entirely consistent with onsager s conjecture concerning the increased likelihood of observing large - scale structure at sufficiently high energies , notably it is also independent of the thermodynamic temperature of the system .",
    "in addition , the results indicate that point - vortex dynamics , at least on the isotropic sphere , are ergodic and therefore statistical measures derived from the dynamics of almost all initial states simply relax to those given by the microcanonical ensemble . for the kinetic energy spectra ( equivalently @xmath120 distributions ) examined here , the relaxation takes place on timescales comparable to an eddy turnover time , independent of the system temperature . as such , for the simplest bounded domain , there is no direct relationship between the sign of the statistical temperature and the direction of any dynamic cascade process in the velocity field induced by a finite number of point vortices .",
