    "<S> , many new charmonium states were observed by babar , belle and cdf collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> there is growing evidence that at least some of these new states are non conventional @xmath10 states . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> the masses of these states are very close to the meson - meson threshold , like the @xmath11 @xcite and the @xmath12 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> other possible interpretations for these states are tetraquarks , hybrid mesons , or threshold effects .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently the cdf collaboration @xcite reported a further study of the structures in the @xmath13 invariant mass , produced in exclusive @xmath14 decays . </S>",
    "<S> besides confirming the @xmath15 state @xcite with a significance greater than 5@xmath16 , cdf also find evidence for a second structure with approximately @xmath17 significance . </S>",
    "<S> the reported mass and width of this structure are @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this new structure , refered as @xmath0 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , was interpreted as the s - wave @xmath2 molecular state . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref .  @xcite have also predicted a s - wave @xmath8 molecular state with a mass around 4.2 gev , which they call as the cousin of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this state is compatible with the enhancement structure around 4.2 gev observed in the @xmath20 invariant mass spectrum from @xmath21 decay @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these two pseudoscalar molecular states could be the analogue of the @xmath15 and @xmath22 ( reported by the belle collaboration @xcite and confirmed by the babar collaboration @xcite ) , that were interpreted , in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> here we use the qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite , to check the suggestion made by the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we study the two - point function based on a @xmath25 molecular current with @xmath3 , to see if the new observed structure , the @xmath0 , can be interpreted as such molecular state . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the @xmath26 molecular current . </S>",
    "<S> previous calculations for the new charmonium states interpreted as molecular or tetraquark states can be found at @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible @xmath25 molecular current with @xmath3 is given byj = i2 , [ field ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are color indices .    </S>",

    "<S> the sum rule is obtained by evaluating the correlation function in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) in two ways : in the ope side and in the phenomenological side . in the ope side we work at leading order in @xmath4 in the operators , we consider the contributions from condensates up to dimension ten and we keep terms which are linear in the strange quark mass @xmath5 . in the phenomenological side , the correlation function is calculated by inserting intermediate states for the @xmath25 molecular state . the coupling of the molecular state , @xmath29 , to the current , @xmath30 , in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ field ] ) can be parametrized in terms of the parameter @xmath31 0 | j|m=. [ lam ]    although there is no one to one correspondence between the current and the state , since the current in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ field ] ) can be rewritten in terms of a sum over tetraquark type currents , by the use of the fierz transformation , the parameter @xmath31 , appearing in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lam ] ) , gives a measure of the strength of the coupling between the current and the state . </S>",
    "<S> besides , as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in the fierz transformation of a molecular current , each tetraquark component contributes with suppression factors that originate from picking up the correct dirac and color indices . </S>",
    "<S> this means that if the physical state is a molecular state , it would be best to choose a molecular type of current so that it has a large overlap with the physical state . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> for the three - gluon condensate we use @xmath51 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the continuum threshold is a physical parameter that should be determined from the spectrum of the mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the continuum threshold in the qcdsr approach is , in general , given as the value of the mass of the first excitated state squared . </S>",
    "<S> in some known cases , like the @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the first excitated state has a mass approximately @xmath54 above the ground state mass . in the cases that one does not know the spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> one expects the continuum threshold to be approximately the square of the mass of the state plus @xmath54 : @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to fix the continuum threshold range we extract the mass from the sum rule , for a given @xmath33 , and accept such value of @xmath33 if the obtained mass is in the range 0.4 gev to 0.6 gev smaller than @xmath56 . using this criterion </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath33 in the range @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> the borel window is determined by analysing the ope convergence , the borel stability and the pole contribution . to determine the minimum value of the borel mass we impose that the contribution of the higher dimension condensate should be smaller than 10% of the total contribution : @xmath58 is such that     in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figconv ] we show the relative contribution of all the terms in the ope side of the sum rule , in the region @xmath59 , for @xmath60 . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> we see that the contribution of the dimension-10 condensate is smaller than 10% of the total contribution for values of @xmath61 , and that we have an excellent ope convergence for @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> to have an idea of the importance of the different terms in the ope , we show , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ opeterms ] , the contribution of each condensate . </S>",
    "<S> as we can see , the condensates of dimension higher than six are , at least , one order of magnetude smaller than the perturbative contribution , in all considered borel region .    </S>",
    "<S> as commented above , the ope convergence is very good in the borel range @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the borel stability for the mass of the state is only good for @xmath63 , as can be seen through the solid line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we fix the lower value of @xmath64 in the sum rule window as @xmath65 gev@xmath66 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm1 ] we also show , through the dashed and dotted lines , the result obtained if we neglect the contribution of dimension-8 and dimension-10 gluon condensates . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the contribution of the dimension-8 and -10 gluon condensates ( @xmath67 ) are only important in the region @xmath68 , which is not in our borel window , due to the mass stability . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at least in this case , the contribution of higher dimension gluon condensates could be safely neglected . </S>",
    "<S> besides , as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm2 ] , where we show the results for the mass for different values of @xmath56 considering all condensate contributions up to dimension-10 , the dependence of the mass on the ope convergence is smaller than the its dependence on the continuum threshold parameter .    to be able to extract , from the sum rule , information about the low - lying resonance , the pole contribution to the sum rule should be bigger than , or at least equal to , the continuum contribution . since the continuum contribution increases with @xmath64 , due to the dominance of the perturbative contribution </S>",
    "<S> , we fix the maximum value of the borel mass to be the one for which the pole contribution is equal to the continuum contribution .    from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figpvc ] we see that for @xmath69 , the pole contribution is bigger than the continuum contribution for @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we show in table i the values of @xmath71 for other values of @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> although for @xmath72 there is still a small allowed borel window , the difference between the obtained mass and the continuum threshold is very small ( smaller than 0.2 gev ) . </S>",
