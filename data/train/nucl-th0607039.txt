    "it is an extrapolation of 18 orders of magnitude from the neutron radius of a heavy nucleus  such as @xmath1pb with a neutron radius of @xmath2  fm  to the approximately 10  km radius of a neutron star . yet",
    "both radii depend on our incomplete knowledge of the equation of state of neutron - rich matter . that strong correlations arise among objects of such disparate sizes",
    "is not difficult to understand .",
    "heavy nuclei develop a neutron - rich skin as a result of its large neutron excess ( _ e.g. , _ @xmath3 in @xmath1pb ) and because the large coulomb barrier reduces the proton density at the surface of the nucleus .",
    "thus the thickness of the neutron skin depends on the pressure that pushes neutrons out against surface tension . as a result , the greater the pressure , the thicker the neutron skin  @xcite .",
    "yet it is this same pressure that supports a neutron star against gravitational collapse  @xcite .",
    "thus models with thicker neutron skins often produce neutron stars with larger radii  @xcite .",
    "the above discussion suggests that an accurate and model - independent measurement of the neutron skin of even a single heavy nucleus may have important implications for neutron - star properties .",
    "attempts at mapping the neutron distribution have traditionally relied on strongly - interacting probes . while highly mature and successful , it is unlikely that the hadronic program will ever attain the precision status that the electroweak program enjoys .",
    "this is due to the large and controversial uncertainties in the reaction mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the mismatch in our knowledge of the proton radius in @xmath0pb relative to that of the neutron radius provides a striking example of the current situation : while the charge radius of @xmath0pb is known to better than 0.001  fm  @xcite , realistic estimates place the uncertainty in the neutron radius at about 0.2 fm  @xcite .",
    "the enormously successful parity - violating program at the jefferson laboratory  @xcite provides an attractive electroweak alternative to the hadronic program .",
    "indeed , the parity radius experiment ( prex ) at the jefferson laboratory aims to measure the neutron radius of @xmath1pb accurately ( to within @xmath4  fm ) and model independently via parity - violating electron scattering  @xcite .",
    "parity violation at low momentum transfers is particularly sensitive to the neutron density because the @xmath5 boson couples primarily to neutrons .",
    "moreover , the parity - violating asymmetry , while small , can be interpreted with as much confidence as conventional electromagnetic scattering experiments .",
    "prex will provide a unique observational constraint on the thickness of the neutron skin of a heavy nucleus .",
    "we note that since first proposed in 1999 , many of the technical difficulties intrinsic to such a challenging experiment have been met .",
    "for example , during the recent activity at the hall a proton parity experiment ( happex ) , significant progress was made in controlling helicity correlated errors  @xcite .",
    "other technical problems are currently being solved  such as the designed of a new septum magnet  and a specific timeline has been provided to solve all remaining problems within the next two years  @xcite .    our aim in this contribution is to report on some of our recent results that examine the correlation between the neutron skin of @xmath0pb and various neutron - star properties  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we examine the consequences of a `` softer '' equation of state that is based on a new accurately calibrated relativistic parameter set that has been constrained by both the ground state properties of finite nuclei and their linear response .",
    "further , results obtained with this new parameter set  dubbed `` fsugold ''  @xcite  will be compared against the nl3 parameter set of lalazissis , konig , and ring  @xcite that , while highly successful , predicts a significantly stiffer equation of state .",
    "the starting point for the calculation of the properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars is an effective field - theory model based on the following lagrangian density :    @xmath6\\psi \\nonumber \\\\                     & & -      \\frac{\\kappa}{3 ! } ( g_{\\rm s}\\phi)^3 \\!-\\ !      \\frac{\\lambda}{4!}(g_{\\rm",
    "s}\\phi)^4 \\!+\\ !      \\frac{\\zeta}{4 ! }      \\big(g_{\\rm v}^2 v_{\\mu}v^\\mu\\big)^2 \\!+\\ !      \\lambda_{\\rm v }      \\big(g_{\\rho}^{2}\\,{\\bf b}_{\\mu}\\cdot{\\bf b}^{\\mu}\\big )      \\big(g_{\\rm v}^2v_{\\mu}v^\\mu\\big ) \\;.",
    "\\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the lagrangian density includes an isodoublet nucleon field ( @xmath7 ) interacting via the exchange of two isoscalar mesons  a scalar ( @xmath8 ) and a vector ( @xmath9 )  one isovector meson ( @xmath10 ) , and the photon ( @xmath11 )  @xcite .",
    "in addition to meson - nucleon interactions , the lagrangian density is supplemented by four nonlinear meson interactions , with coupling constants denoted by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the first three of these terms are responsible for a softening of the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter at both normal and high densities  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cubic ( @xmath12 ) and quartic ( @xmath13 ) scalar self - energy terms are needed to reduce the compression modulus of symmetric nuclear matter , in accordance to measurements of the giant monopole resonance in medium to heavy nuclei  @xcite . in turn ,",
    "@xmath16-meson self - interactions ( @xmath14 ) are instrumental for the softening of the equation of state at high density  thereby affecting primarily the limiting masses of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "finally , the last of the coupling constants ( @xmath15 ) induces isoscalar - isovector mixing and has been added to tune the poorly - known density dependence of the symmetry energy  @xcite . as a result of the strong correlation between the neutron radius of heavy nuclei and the pressure of neutron - rich matter  @xcite ,",
    "the neutron skin of a heavy nucleus is highly sensitive to changes in @xmath15 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in conclusion , a new accurately calibrated relativistic model ( `` fsugold '' ) has been fitted to the binding energies and charge radii of a variety of magic nuclei . in this regard ,",
    "the new parametrization is as successful as the nl3 set which has been used here as a useful paradigm . in particular ,",
    "symmetric nuclear matter saturates at a fermi momentum of @xmath17 ( corresponding to a baryon density of @xmath18 ) with a binding energy per nucleon of @xmath19  mev .",
    "further , by constraining the fsugold parameter set by a few nuclear collective modes , we obtain a nuclear - matter incompressibility of @xmath20  mev and a neutron skin thickness in @xmath0pb of @xmath21  fm .",
    "while the description of the various collective modes imposes additional constraints on the eos at densities around saturation density , the high - density component of the eos remains largely unconstrained .",
    "thus , we made no attempts at constraining the eos at the supranuclear densities of relevance to neutron - star physics .",
    "rather , we simply explored the consequences of the new parametrization on a variety of neutron star observables and eagerly await high - quality data that will constrain the high - density component of the eos .",
    "in particular , we found a limiting neutron - star mass of @xmath22 , a radius of @xmath23  km for a @xmath24 neutron star , and no direct urca cooling in neutron stars with masses below @xmath25 .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent observations of pulsar - white dwarf binaries at the arecibo observatory suggest a pulsar mass for psrj0751 + 1807 of @xmath26 at a 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "if this observation could be refined , not only would it redefine the high - density behavior of this ( and many other ) eos , but it could provide us with a precious boost in our quest for the equation of state ."
