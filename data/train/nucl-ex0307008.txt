    "in a recent investigation of solid d@xmath0 as a ucn source@xcite , it was surmised that the yield of ucn is correlated with the spin states of the deuterium molecules .",
    "subsequently , detailed neutron scattering calculations and measurements of the ucn lifetime in mixtures of para- and ortho - deuterium quantitatively verified this conjecture.@xcite the work we report here was motivated by our attempt to control the spin state of deuterium and develop a superthermal ultracold neutron source capable of the extremely high ucn yields predicted for pure ortho - d@xmath0 crystals by golub @xmath2@xcite at least three solid deuterium sources are currently under construction.@xcite    our superthermal solid d@xmath0 source at los alamos neutron science center ( lansce ) can be envisioned as roughly one liter of solid deuterium held at temperatures below 10 k. this block of deuterium is then immersed in a cold neutron flux .",
    "ucn are produced when the cold neutrons are downscattered , losing almost all of their energy . because the source is operated at very low temperatures , the loss rates due to thermal upscattering are very small for ucn and the produced ucn",
    "can be efficiently extracted from the source .",
    "the ultimate ucn densities one can achieve with a superthermal source are@xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ucn density , @xmath5 is the downscattering rate for cold neutrons , and @xmath6 is the ucn survival time in the solid d@xmath0 . with a careful design ,",
    "the downscattered neutrons are prevented from subsequent scatterings within the source to establish thermal equilibrium ; several orders of magnitude improvement in available ucn densities are expected from these sources .",
    "it is also clear from eq .",
    "[ ucndensity ] that longer ucn survival times , @xmath6 , equate to higher ucn densities .",
    "para - deuterium , if present in the source , drastically increases the ucn loss rate and , therefore , decreases @xmath6 and reduces the yielded ucn densities .",
    "an essential key to optimizing the performance of a solid d@xmath0 ucn source is thus to minimize the concentration of para - d@xmath0 in the deuterium . in what follows , we present the results obtained during the first nine months of operation of our ucn source coupled to a para - to - ortho converter . because we present the results of a development project , the performance of this system was not fully optimized",
    "nevertheless , the experimental technique is robust ; it should form the basis of a workable approach to the operation of a solid deuterium superthermal source of ucn .",
    "in addition , hd , a common contaminant in commercially available deuterium , also greatly reduces the survival time for ucn in our solid deuterium source , simply because of the large neutron absorption cross - section of the hydrogen nucleus .",
    "ideally , our experimental technique for monitoring the para - deuterium concentration in our source should also be useful in monitoring hd levels .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , this is the case for the raman spectroscopy technique presented in this work .",
    "the physics of hydrogen and deuterium solids has been thoroughly discussed in various reviews@xcite , so we will merely touch on the relevant properties of these crystals .",
    "first of all , the deuterium molecule ( d@xmath0 ) has a symmetric wave - function under permutations of the two identical nuclei , deuterons , having a nuclear spin @xmath7 . as a result",
    ", the ortho state for deuterium ( @xmath8 ) can only have symmetrical molecular rotational states of even @xmath9 , the rotational quantum number , i.e. , @xmath10 ; and the para state ( @xmath11 ) can only have anti - symmetrical molecular rotational states of odd @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath12 . at the typical low operational temperatures of superthermal sources , because of the relatively large vibrational excitation energy ( first vibrational excitation energy level is @xmath134000k ) , all of the molecules are expected to be in the vibrational ground state . on the other hand , it is possible to find significant populations of the first ( @xmath14 ) rotational excited states of the molecules ( para - d@xmath0 ) , in addition to the ground state with @xmath15 ( ortho - d@xmath0 ) , depending on how the sample is prepared .    the rotational energy spectrum ( shown in fig . [ figu_estate ] ) of the d@xmath0 molecule can be described using a classical dumbbell picture : @xmath16 where the factor @xmath17 is related to the momentum of inertia , @xmath18 . to a first approximation , @xmath19 mev , in which the separation between the two nuclei , @xmath20 , is 0.74 @xmath21 .",
    "the energy required to make the transition from the ground state ( @xmath15 ) to the first excited state ( @xmath14 ) is thus 7.5 mev .",
    ".,width=2 ]    in the high temperature limit all the nuclear spin sub - states are equally populated .",
    "this leads to an equilibrium para state concentration of 33.3% . for a free non - interacting gas ,",
    "transitions between even @xmath9 ( ortho ) and odd @xmath9 ( para ) states are prohibited by the spin selection rules .",
    "conversion of para to ortho states involves a nuclear spin flip , which requires , in general , an external interaction potential . in real situations ,",
    "spontaneous spin flipping occurs through collisions between the aspherical molecules ( @xmath22 ) , whose non - central quadrupole interaction provides a small , yet finite torque to induce spin flip .",
    "the resulting time constant for such a self - conversion is , however , very long , and has been measured to be on the order of months@xcite .",
    "our experimental goal is to reduce the para - d@xmath0 fraction present in our cryogenic solid d@xmath0 source material to the level where it no longer limits the ucn survival time , @xmath6 , in the crystal .",
    "this can be achieved by reducing the para - d@xmath0 concentration below about 1% . at this level ,",
    "the ucn loss rate in the crystal due to ucn upscattering from the para - d@xmath0 is roughly the same as the loss rate due to nuclear absorptions by the deuterium nuclei.@xcite because the neutron absorption losses in the deuterium itself are unavoidable , little improvement can be obtained by further lowering the para - deuterium concentration .    an effective way to reduce para state concentrations",
    "is to pass d@xmath0 gas through a system which permits the d@xmath0 to rapidly come into thermal equilibrium at a low temperature by inducing a spin flip process .",
    "the residual population of the @xmath14 state can be described by the boltzmann factor , which is characterized by the transition energy , @xmath23 mev(@xmath13 80 k ) .",
    "when the converter is operated at 17k , the para concentration could in principle be reduced from 33.3% down to @xmath24 = 1% .",
    "converter temperatures below 17k can in principle give a smaller population of para states , but they supply converted d@xmath0 with less than the required vapor pressure ( 30 to 50 torr ) from the converter to sustain ortho - deuterium solid growth in a timely , continuous fashion in our application .",
    "we apply paramagnetic conversion@xcite to prepare our deuterium samples .",
    "the paramagnetic catalyst agent has a large magnetic field near its surface , on which d@xmath0 molecules are temporarily adsorbed and form a van der waals layer .",
    "the magnetic field gradient induces a relative dephasing between the two precessing nuclear spins , and results in a spin flip . for a single adsorbed molecule",
    "this transition rate is nearly temperature independent , and thus the conversion rate is dominated by the gas adsorption probability . combining these two effects , one can predict that the overall conversion efficiency increases as the catalyst temperature decreases , compatible with our low temperature application .",
    "one of the most effective paramagnetic catalyst materials is hydrous ferric oxide , fe@xmath0o@xmath25(h@xmath0o ) , a self - supporting metal oxide in the form of colloidal gels.@xcite it has an effective surface area of 100@xmath13300 m@xmath26/g.@xcite as suggested by ref.@xcite , we carried out the initial activation by heating the catalyst up to 130 @xmath27c for 24 hours inside the converter cell under the vacuum and then back - filled the cell with deuterium gas for preservation .",
    "installation of the converter cell into the vacuum system was performed with care to minimize exposure to the ambient air .",
    "after some period of operation , which varied with the conversion load , regeneration of the catalyst was performed with the same activation procedure .",
    "converter.,width=2 ]    we built the converter chamber out of a cylindrical cell made of ofhc copper , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figu_converter ] .",
    "it is attached to the cold head of an air - cooled @xmath28he compression cryopump , varian cryotorr 8 , which served as a refrigerator .",
    "the cryopump has an inner cooling stage ( cold head ) with a cooling power of 1 w at a temperature of 10k ( 5w at 20k ) , which is adequate for our applied conversion load .",
    "this closed system of @xmath28he gas compression cryopump provides an easy and compact alternative to the liquid @xmath28he evaporation cooling used in previous experiments@xcite .",
    "the converter cell s design features are summarized in the following : the d@xmath0 gas exit port is situated at the coolest plate to anchor the temperature of the output converted d@xmath0 ; it also minimizes the temperature gradient across the d@xmath0 gas flow .",
    "in addition , in order to reduce the heat load onto the cold head , we designed a 180 cm long heat exchange coil made of coaxial stainless steel ( s.s . ) thin tubes .",
    "the inflow gas inside the inner thin tube is precooled by the outflow gas flowing in the outer tube .",
    "its long length increases the thermal resistance and thus minimizes the heat conduction through the s.s .",
    "tubes to the ambient environment . with a flow rate of 36 liter / hour ( 0.6 liter / min ) of stp gas",
    ", the heat load is about 1w .",
    "the heat load is dominated by contributions from the d@xmath0 gas specific heat and the ortho / para - d@xmath0 conversion energy .",

    "inner volume of the cell is filled with fine grained catalyst , which is confined in the converter cell by s.s .",
    "wool filters plugged into both the gas entrance and the exit ports .",
    "a heater is mounted on the cold plate to provide us the capability to control and vary the temperature of the converter .",
    "two temperature diode sensors are separately placed on the top and the bottom of the copper cylinder to monitor the temperature , as well as the gradient . moreover , in order to tolerate baking for catalyst regeneration , an in / pb alloy wire is used between the top plate and the converter can for the vacuum seal .",
    "this soft alloy has a higher melting point ( 150@xmath27c ) than the regeneration temperature ( 130@xmath27c ) .",
    "pure indium metal ( with a melting point of 110@xmath27c ) is not compatible with regeneration baking .",
    "we also established that these regeneration bake - outs could occur with the cell still mounted to the cold - head of our cryopump , making regeneration of the catalyst quite straightforward .",
    "the operation of this converter is in a continuous mode described in the following . the pressure regulated d@xmath0 gas is introduced into the converter ; after flowing through the converter in which the catalyst is held below the d@xmath0 triple point temperature ( 18.7k ) , d@xmath29 is converted predominantly into the ortho state with a reduced para contamination of roughly 1% .",
    "the converted d@xmath0 is then continuously cryopumped onto the superthermal source cryostat ( cooled by liquid he ) .",
    "we observed that it was possible to grow a very transparent , large solid block of d@xmath0 directly from flowing gas into our source cryostat when the vapor pressure was kept below about 50 torr .",
    "the corresponding low d@xmath0 flow rate is limited to acceptable levels at which the heat flow into the low temperature end of the cryostat and the growing crystal .",

    "the para - to - ortho converter was put in the downstream of a hydrogen gas purifier ( palladium filter ) which operates at 400 @xmath27c .",
    "care was taken to minimize the magnetic surface area inside the apparatus placed after the para - to - ortho - d@xmath0 converter , in order to prevent back - conversion and to preserve the fully converted ortho - d@xmath0 .",
    "our measurements show that when converted d@xmath0 gas is passed through our room temperature s.s .",

    "we used two different , complimentary measurements to determine the para - d@xmath0 concentration in our ucn source .",
    "an in - line thermal conductivity measurement with hot wire cells was frequently performed on the outflowing d@xmath0 to characterize the performance of the para - to - ortho - d@xmath0 converter .",
    "molecular raman spectroscopy @xcite was later conducted on the evaporated d@xmath0 , which was collected from the cryostat at the end of each operational run of our source .",
    "this optical method uses a visible ( far off - resonance ) laser to probe d@xmath0 molecule gas sample .",
    "the rotational raman spectrum gives information on rotational state populations .",
    "for example , for molecules in thermal equilibrium , the total raman cross - section is formulated as@xcite @xmath30 with ` @xmath31 ' standing for stokes lines , and ` @xmath32 ' for anti - stokes lines , @xmath33 is the partition function for the rotational states , and @xmath34 is the multiplicity of the nuclear spin states . in the equation above we took @xmath35@xmath36 from the absolute rotational raman cross - section for d@xmath0 using the cross - sections quoted for the @xmath37 transition in h@xmath0 at room temperature in fenner@xcite .",

    "it also images the raman radiation onto the entrance slit of the spectrometer , which is placed slightly less than one focal length away , yielding a magnification of about 6 for the image of the laser scattering region on the spectrometer slits .",
    "the spectrometer is a jarrel ash , model 82 - 000 , single grating spectrometer with a focal length of 50 cm .",
    "it is equipped with a 1800 g / mm holographic grating blazed at 500 nm .",
    "we direct the primary laser path vertically through the cell so that it would be parallel to the entrance slit , for the optimization of the scattered light collection into the spectrometer .",

    "[ figu_ramanfilter ] .",
    "the price we paid for using such a filter is it eliminates the first rotational peak , and distorts the second peak .",

    "subsequent improvement of the light collection and replacement of our laser dropped this time to roughly 10 minutes .",

    "these results were achieved with a converter temperature of 17k , an outlet pressure at the converter of around 35 mbar , and a flow rate of around 0.5 stp liters / min .",
    "the conversion efficiency of the catalyst reduced over time , with the 17k converter producing converted d@xmath0 gas with a para - d@xmath0 fraction growing from 1.5% to 11% over the period in which our ucn experiments were conducted .",
    "these measurements were performed to determine the ucn lifetime in solid deuterium . in fig .",
    "[ figu_neutron ] , we present the measured ucn lifetimes as a function of the para - d@xmath0 fraction.@xcite the extracted value for the lifetime in a pure para - d@xmath0 crystal is in excellent agreement with the theoretical expectations and provides substantiating evidence that our technique is effective .      another point of contact between the function of the converter and our two para fraction measurement techniques can be made through tests conducted at the end of our measurement period . although the efficiency of the converter had deteriorated , we investigated the converter performance by adjusting ( via . the attached heater ) the temperature of the converter cell and then measuring the resultant para- to ortho - d@xmath0 ratios immediately .",
    "once again , we were able to produce para- to ortho - d@xmath0 ratios at the 1.5% level , although for these measurements the converter was held at 16 k and the flow rate was reduced .",
    "the problem of catalyst aging has been well investigated in literatures.@xcite hydrous gels lose water and coalesce into granules over time .",
    "this change of structure from amorphous gel to micro - crystals is evident from x - ray scattering experiments@xcite .",
    "the volume shrinks by over a factor of 500 due to this dehydration , and results in the reduction of the conversion efficiency .",
    "it is thus advisable to work with fresh gels , and not to attempt repeated regenerations .",
    "one way to prevent dehydration might involve refrigeration of the catalyst right after formation .",
    "regeneration of the catalyst by heating it to 130@xmath27c under atmosphere was reported to restore the catalytic performance@xcite , however , for the intermittent , brief use of the converter we envision for our source , one might as well replenish the converter with fresh catalyst when necessary . one potential concern regards the possible formation of hd while d@xmath0 gas passes through the hydrogen - rich catalyst via isotope exchange .",
    "this , however , was not experimentally observed probably because of the low operational temperature of the catalyst cell .    at present , the dependence of converter efficiency on its various operational parameters ( temperature , pressure , flow rate , etc ... ) remain to be thoroughly investigated .",
    "at least two effects are worthy of note .",
    "we observed that the vapor pressure at the outlet of the converter was roughly a factor of ten smaller than one might expect for d@xmath0 in equilibrium with its saturated vapor pressure at the converter cell temperature ( up to 30k ) .",
    "one would intuitively attribute this phenomenon to the large binding energy of the catalyst surface .",
    "we were able to flow adequate quantities of d@xmath0 through the cell by maintaining a pressure gradient of 50 to 80 mbar across the cell , but when the cell was operated at temperatures below 21k we occasionally experienced a gradual increase in the flow impedance , which may have been the result of forming solid d@xmath0 `` plugs '' due to the shift of the gas - solid phase transition curve .",
    "this plugging phenomenon may also be attributable to water contamination of our d@xmath0 gas .",
    "in fact we also observed that pre - purifying the deuterium gas through the palladium filter was essential in preventing the ice plugs from forming inside the para - to - ortho converter .",
    "when scanning the temperature of our conversion cell across the triple point , we measured higher para fractions than were expected near the phase transition temperature .",
    "this phenomenon was observed in two separate scans through the triple point , with both the raman spectroscopy and thermal conductivity cell measurements .",
    "these data appear to be consistent with the latent heat of a phase transition in the d@xmath0 providing the necessary energy to repopulate the j@xmath61 rotational state , but given the limited quantity of data we have on this phenomenon at present , we feel more work is required before a compelling conclusion can be drawn .",
    "in particular , these traces were obtained at the end of the 9 month operation period in which the converter material was not regenerated , when the performance of our converter was significantly impaired and may not represent typical operating conditions .    in conclusion , we have produced highly converted d@xmath0 with a residual para - d@xmath0 concentration of 1.5% .",
    "this is done with a 100 c.c .",
    "converter filled with hydrous ferric oxide operated at 17 k , with a flow rate of roughly 0.5 liter / min .",
    "we developed an apparatus to monitor para - d@xmath0 and hd contamination to a high precision at levels of 2 parts in 10@xmath1 and 1 part in 10@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "our study of the functionality of the converter leads us to believe that regular replacement with fresh catalyst or thorough regeneration will be required to ensure adequate para - to - ortho - d@xmath0 conversion and that a catalyst which does not largely reduce the d@xmath0 vapor pressure may help avoid complications associated with condensation .",
