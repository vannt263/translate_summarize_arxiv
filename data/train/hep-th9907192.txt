    "the calculation of the casimir energy for boundary conditions given on the surface of an infinite cylinder has turned out to be the most complicated problem in this field  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite an attempt was undertaken to predict the casimir energy of a conducting cylindrical shell treating the cylinder as an intermediate configuration between a sphere and two parallel plates .",
    "taking into account that the vacuum energies of a conducting sphere and conducting plates have the opposite signs , the authors hypothesized that the casimir energy of a cylindrical perfectly conducting shell should be zero .",
    "however , a direct calculation  @xcite showed that this energy is negative as in the case of parallel conducting plates .",
    "this calculation was repeated only in recent papers  @xcite by making use of comprehensive methods , more simple but more formal at the same time .",
    "thus in spite of its half - century history the casimir effect still remains a problem where physical intuition does not work , and in order to reveal even the sign of the casimir energy ( i.e.  the direction of the casimir forces ) it is necessary to carry out a consistent detailed calculation .    the account for dielectric and magnetic properties of the media in the case of nonplanar interface proved to be a very complicated problem in calculation of the casimir energy  @xcite .",
    "however if the light velocity is constant when crossing the interface , then the calculation of the casimir energy of a compact ball  @xcite or cylinder  @xcite is the same as that for conducting spherical or cylindrical shells , respectively . in such calculations the expansion of the casimir energy in terms of the parameter @xmath7",
    "is usually constructed , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , respectively , the permittivity and permeability of the material making up the ball or cylinder , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are those for the surrounding medium .",
    "the same velocity of light , @xmath8 , in both the media implies that the condition @xmath9 is satisfied .",
    "the casimir energy of a compact ball with the same speed of light inside and outside  @xcite and the casimir energy of a pure dielectric ball  @xcite turned out to be of the same sign : they are positive , and consequently the casimir forces are repulsive . and @xmath10 .",
    "] moreover , the extrapolation of the result obtained under the condition @xmath11 to a pure dielectric ball gives a fairly good prediction  @xcite .    for a compact cylinder under the condition @xmath12",
    "it has been found  @xcite that the linear term in the casimir energy expansion in powers of @xmath13 vanishes . keeping in mind the situation with a compact ball possessing the same speed of light inside and outside and a pure dielectric ball , it is tempting to check whether the casimir energy of a compact cylinder under the condition @xmath11 is close to the casimir energy of a pure dielectric cylinder .",
    "however , in the case of a dielectric cylinder a principal difficulty arises , namely , in the integral representation for the corresponding spectral @xmath14-function ( or , in other words , for the sum of eigenfrequencies ) it is impossible to carry out the integration over the longitudinal momentum @xmath15 . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite the casimir energy of a compact dielectric cylinder was evaluated by a direct summation of the van der waals interaction between individual fragments ( molecules ) of the cylinder . by making use of the dimensional regularization",
    ", a vanishing value for this energy was obtained .",
    "it is worth noting that this procedure , having been applied to a pure dielectric ball  @xcite , gives the same result as the quantum field theory approach  @xcite . in view of all this , it is undoubtedly interesting to elucidate whether the vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field for a compact cylinder with the condition @xmath11 vanishes exactly . therefore , the main goal of the present paper is , namely , to extend the analysis made in  @xcite up to the fourth order in @xmath16 . to this accuracy",
    "the casimir energy in question turns out to be nonvanishing .",
    "our consideration is concerned with zero temperature theory only , and the main calculation ignores dispersion .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the first nonvanishing term proportional to @xmath5 is calculated in the expansion of the casimir energy of a compact cylinder in powers of @xmath17 under the condition @xmath11 .",
    "this term proves to be negative , and the casimir forces seek to contract the cylinder reducing its radius , unlike the repulsive forces acting on a compact ball under the same conditions . in sec .",
    "iii the casimir energy in the problem at hand is calculated numerically for several fixed values of the parameter @xmath6 without assuming the smallness of @xmath6 , and the corresponding plot is presented . in sec .",
    "iv the implication of the obtained results in the flux tube model ( hadronic string ) describing the quark dynamics inside the hadrons is considered . in the conclusion ( sec .",
    "v ) some general properties of the casimir effect are briefly discussed .",
    "we start with the formulas which allow us to construct the expansion of the casimir energy of a compact infinite cylinder , possessing the same speed of light inside and outside , in powers of the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the derivation of these formulas can be found in the papers cited below .",
    "when using the mode - by - mode summation method  @xcite or the zeta function technique  @xcite the casimir energy per unit length of a cylinder is represented as a sum of partial energies @xmath18 where @xmath19 ^ 2\\right\\}. \\label{e_2_2}\\ ] ] here the condition @xmath20 is assumed to hold , with @xmath8 being the velocity of light inside and outside the cylinder ( in units of that velocity in vacuum ) .",

    "we obtain for this coefficient @xmath49    thus , the casimir energy of a compact cylinder possessing the same speed of light inside and outside does not vanish and is defined up to the @xmath5 term by the formula @xmath50 in contrast to the casimir energy of a compact ball  @xcite with the same properties @xmath51 the casimir energy of a cylinder under consideration turned out to be negative .",

    "( [ e_2_27 ] ) .",

    "there is its own @xmath34 for each value of @xmath6 .",
    "obviously , one should expect a substantial deviation from eq .",
    "( [ e-2 - 26 ] ) only for @xmath55 .",
    "moreover the main contribution into the casimir energy determined by the sum ( [ e_2_9 ] ) is given by the term @xmath56 which is evaluated now exactly using eq .",

    "the results of the calculations accomplished in this way for @xmath52 are presented in fig .  1 ( solid curve ) . here the casimir energy defined by eq .  ( [ e-2 - 26 ] ) as a function of @xmath6",
    "is also plotted ( dashed curve ) .",
    "when @xmath57 we get the casimir energy of a perfectly conducting cylindrical shell  @xcite . if we used for its calculation the approximate formula ( [ e-2 - 26 ] ) , we should obtain for the dimensionless energy @xmath58 the value @xmath59 instead of @xmath60 .",
    "thereby , the approximate formula ( [ e-2 - 26 ] ) at this point gives a considerable error of @xmath61 . at the same time",
    "the analogous formula ( [ e_2_27 ] ) for a compact ball at @xmath57 gives the casimir energy of a perfectly conducting spherical shell with a few percent error  @xcite .",
    "the constancy condition for the velocity of gluonic field when crossing the interface between two media is used , for example , in a dielectric vacuum model ( dvm ) of quark confinement  @xcite .",
    "this model has many elements in common with the bag models  @xcite , but among the other differences , in dvm there is no explicit condition of the field vanishing outside the bag .",
    "it proves to be important for calculation of the casimir energy contribution to the hadronic mass in dvm .",
    "the point is that in the case of boundaries with nonvanishing curvature there happens a considerable ( not full , however ) mutual cancellation of the divergences from the contributions of internal and external ( with respect to the boundary ) regions .",
    "if only the field confined inside the cavity is considered , as in the bag models  @xcite , then there is no such a cancellation , and one has to remove some divergences by means of renormalization of the phenomenological parameter in the model defining the qcd vacuum energy density .    from a physical point of view the vanishing of the field or its normal",
    "derivative precisely on the boundary is an unsatisfactory condition , because due to quantum fluctuations it is impossible to measure the field as accurately as desired at a certain point of the space  @xcite .    in the dvm",
    "there is also considered a cavity that appears in the qcd vacuum when the invariant @xmath62 exceeds a certain critical value ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the color fields ) . inside the cavity the gluonic field can be treated as an abelian field in view of the asymptotic freedom in qcd . in this approach",
    "it is assumed that in the qcd vacuum ( outside the cavity ) the dielectric constant tends to zero @xmath65 while the magnetic permeability tends to infinity @xmath66 in such a way that the relativistic condition @xmath67 holds . inside the cavity @xmath68 . as it was shown in the present paper for a compact cylinder and in ref .",
    "@xcite for a compact ball , in calculation of the casimir energy the condition @xmath69 proves to be essential , and it is possible to take the limit @xmath70 in the resulting formula putting @xmath71 .",
    "hence , in the dvm as a vacuum energy of gluonic field one should take the casimir energy of a perfectly conducting infinitely thin shell having the shape either of a sphere , or expanded ellipsoid , or cylinder . in the last case we deal with the flux tube model of confinement  @xcite in which a heavy quark and antiquark are considered to be coupled through a cylindrical cavity ( flux tube ) in the qcd vacuum .",
    "obviously , in the flux tube model of confinement the casimir energy of a compact cylinder calculated under the condition @xmath72 should be regarded as a quantum correction to the classical string tension . to estimate this correction ,",
    "it is necessary to define the value of the radius @xmath73 of the flux tube . without pretending at high accuracy",
    "we shall take @xmath73 of the same order as the critical radius @xmath74 in the hadronic string model .",
    "is expressed through the phenomenological parameter , the flux of the gluonic field , that in its turn requires a definition .",
    "] at the distances between the quarks smaller than @xmath74 the flux tube model has no sense . in the nambu - goto string model @xmath74",
    "is determined by the string tension @xmath75  @xcite @xmath76 hence , we obtain the following estimation for the casimir energy contribution into the string tension in the flux tube model @xmath77 the multiplier @xmath78 makes an account for the contribution of the eight gluonic field components into the string tension .",
    "thus , unlike the conclusion made in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 1988 ) ) , the quantum correction to the classical string tension , determined by the gluonic field confined in the flux tube , turned out to be essential @xmath79 .",
    "this fact should be taken into account in detailed examination of this model .",
    "the casimir energy of a compact cylinder under the condition @xmath11 does not vanish , but it is negative with the absolute value increasing as @xmath5 for small @xmath6 .",
    "the casimir forces seek to contract the cylinder .",
    "the calculation of the vacuum energy for the boundary conditions of different geometries both with the account for the properties of the materials and without such accounting enables one to make the following general conclusion . in a concrete problem the direction of the casimir forces",
    "is determined only by the geometry of the boundaries .",
    "dielectric and magnetic properties of the media can not change the direction of these forces .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the calculation of the casimir effect for parallel conducting plates , for a sphere and cylinder , these boundaries being considered in the vacuum or dividing the materials with different dielectric and magnetic properties .",
    "even a dilute dielectric cylinder mentioned above does not violate this pattern .",
    "maybe the casimir forces in this case vanish in fact , but there are no indications that they can become repulsive .",
    "the account for the dispersion probably does not change this inference .",
    "the calculation of the casimir energy carried out in  @xcite for a compact ball with @xmath80 and @xmath81 dependent on the frequencies of electromagnetic oscillations @xmath82 confirms this . in ref .",
    "@xcite the casimir forces affecting a compact cylinder when @xmath83 were investigated . to remove the divergences the authors introduced a double cutoff over the frequency @xmath84 and over the angular momentum @xmath34 .",
    "the finite answer proved to be very involved and depended on the cutoff parameters , but the casimir forces are attractive as in our consideration .",
    "however there are other points of view concerning the role of dispersion in the casimir effect  @xcite .",
