    "the evolution of the superbubbles and supershells that have sizes ranging from several tens to hundreds of parsec plays an important role in understanding the amount and distribution of warm gas in the ism .",
    "furthermore , understanding the characteristics of starbursts and their relationship with the ism , as well as to be able to parametrize the star formation history are crucial in understanding the galaxy evolution .    in the past",

    "these have revealed that the physical conditions ( such as gas density , fuv flux , and gas kinetic temperature ) are enhanced in starburst regions . however , none of these models are able to relate the observed line emission properties of the neutral gas in a starburst galaxy to its age and star formation history . in this paper , we introduce an evolving starburst model for fir / sub - mm / mm line emission in gas media that allows us to ultimately achieve this goal .",
    "our model consists of a standard dynamical model of the bubble / shell structure around a young star cluster ( see fig .  [ shell ] ) , which has been described in many publications ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we compare our modeling results with the observations of the expanding supershell and average gas properties in the central 1.0 kpc region of the nearby starburst galaxy m 82 ( section 4 ) . finally , we present the conclusions of this study ( section 5 )",
    ".    the basic assumptions for our evolving starburst model are ( 1 ) star formation occurs primarily within the dense optically thick spherical cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that all stars form instantaneously in a compact spherical cluster located at the center of the cloud ( the star cluster is therefore treated as a point source ) , and ( 2 ) the starlight produced by the central cluster is completely absorbed and reprocessed by the dust in the expanding shell @xcite . a summary of our evolving starburst model is presented in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",

    "dopita et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also suggested that the higher ism pressure in starburst regions causes the expanding shell to stall at a smaller radius .",
    "another argument is that the gravitational instability may induce new star formation inside the shells .",
    "these concerns may indicate that the conventional bubble / shell dynamics @xcite may need to be modified .",

    "the swept - up shell itself is supported by thermal gas pressure and non - thermal pressure due to micro - turbulence .",

    "m 82 is an irregular starburst galaxy located at a distance of about 3.25 mpc .",
    "this galaxy has been observed over a wide range of wavelengths .",

    "it is clear that the starburst age of the whole central region is model dependent .",
    "more simulations with a variety of input cloud conditions and a comparison with data taken at a wider range of wavelengths are needed in order to identify the ages of starbursts accurately .",
    "although different stages of development are applicable to different central regions of m 82 , the shell sizes and the physical conditions of the gas within the rings ( diameter @xmath14 300 - 600 pc ) predicted by our model are similar to what is expected from models involving expanding shells from a central starburst such as those proposed by carlstrom & kronberg ( 1991 ) . therefore , it is possible that the molecular rings in m 82 are a product of gas that was swept - up by the nuclear starburst activity which has evolved for about 10@xmath77 yr .",
    "their hypothesis is supported by the observations of co line emission and continuum emission , as well as the discovery of supershells that have not yet had time to break out of the galactic plane .",
    "however , it is important to realize the foregoing interpretation of the lobes as a ring or torus is not unique .",
    "a number of authors have argued that the molecular rings may be a product of linblad resonance instabilities associated with the gravitational effects of the bar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we have illustrated our model by a comparison with the observations of the expanding supershell centered around snr 41.9 + 58 .",
    "the very good agreement implies that the expanding supershell is created by strong stellar winds and sn explosions from a young star cluster ( @xmath14 2.5 @xmath30 10@xmath79 m@xmath5 ) located in its center .",
    "our model predictions of co , hcn , and hco@xmath101 line ratios agree with the molecular data for the central lobes ( 300 - 600 pc ) for a shell with an age in the 3 - 7 myr range .",
    "this implies that the molecular rings are possibly a consequence of swept - up or compressed gas caused by massive star formation originating in the nucleus of m 82 .",
    "more simulations in future work may be able to justify this hypothesis .",
    "the atomic line ratios calculated by our model do not fit the observed data as well as the molecular data , but suggest a much older shell , because the atomic line emission comes from a much larger region ( @xmath16 1 kpc ) .",
    "a variety of modeling parameters need to be considered to yield more accurate starburst ages .",
    "our model also yields appropriate values for the gas density , temperature , and structure scales compared to those measured in the center of m 82 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
