    "high - sensitivity measurements of mechanical displacements were initially conducted in large scale interferometers for the detection of gravitational waves predicted by einstein . from then on , coupling between mechanical oscillators and optical fields via radiation pressure has been extensively studied within the field of optomechanics and has found applications for single spin detection by magnetic resonance force microscopy @xcite , attometer - scale displacement measurements @xcite , chip - based room temperature magnetometry @xcite , and observation of quantum phenomena in macroscopic mechanical systems @xcite .",
    "continuous measurement of the displacement of a mechanical resonator involves the transduction of mechanical motion onto the amplitude and phase fluctuations of an optical probe beam which are subsequently measured with an interferometer .",
    "such a measurement is limited by imprecision noise set by the photon shot noise of the probe light and scaling as @xmath0 where n is the number of photons in the probe light .",
    "it seems that arbitrarily precise readout can be achieved simply by increasing the optical power , however a fluctuating radiation pressure force imparted on the mechanical resonator due to photon shot noise gives rise to quantum back - action noise which scales as @xmath1 and counteracts the improvement in measurement sensitivity for large @xmath2 .",
    "the limit in readout precision achieved when the sum of the two noise contributions is minimum , is called the standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite .",
    "imprecision noise surpassing the sql has recently been achieved in a regime where the total measurement noise is dominated by mechanical thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this was quickly followed by experiments where radiation pressure noise dominates the thermal noise , that allowed the observation of radiation - pressure shot noise and ponderomotive squeezing @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experiments with atom clouds cooled close to their motional ground state have recently demonstrated force sensing within a factor of 4 above the sql @xcite .",
    "since the early days of large - scale gravitational - wave interferometers , it was recognized that the use of squeezed light as a quantum sensing resource could improve the sensitivity of interferometric phase measurements beyond the shot noise limit @xcite .",
    "this was later experimentally demonstrated for mach - zehnder @xcite , michelson @xcite , sagnac @xcite and large - scale gravitational - wave interferometers @xcite , and applied to displacement measurements @xcite of particles in biological samples @xcite and micro - mechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "the use of squeezed light gives access to sql sensitivity at lower optical probe power , as a reduction of imprecision noise on the squeezed quadrature is accompanied by an increase in quantum back - action noise due to antisqueezing on the conjugate quadrature .",
    "the use of squeezed light is therefore beneficial in systems for which the use of high optical powers is limited by technical reasons , e.g. maximum output power of existing lasers , or practical reasons , e.g. damage threshold of biological samples . in high - q microcavity resonators , increasing optical powers gives rise to additional noise due to parametric instabilities @xcite what prevents reaching sensitivities at the sql .",
    "the aim of this article is to determine the conditions for reaching optimum quantum - enhanced displacement sensitivities in cavity optomechanical systems .",
    "cavity optomechanical systems @xcite come in a lot of different arrangements , from cold atoms trapped in optical cavities @xcite to nano- @xcite and micro - scale @xcite resonators , and gram - scale mirrors in interferometers @xcite .",
    "they consist of an optical cavity mode coupled to a mechanical harmonic oscillator via the radiation pressure mediated optomechanical interaction .",
    "the motion of the mechanical oscillator modifies the optical length of the cavity resulting in a shift of the optical resonance frequency .",

    "the optomechanical interaction scales with the vacuum optomechanical coupling parameter @xmath11 @xcite , which quantifies the optical frequency noise arising from the zero - point - motion of the oscillator .",

    ". the effective optomechanical coupling rate , @xmath36 , captures the mutual transduction between the photon and phonon fields : the cavity photons exchange momentum with the mechanical oscillator via the radiation pressure interaction , while the phase of the intracavity field is modulated by the fluctuations of the cavity length .",
    "the strength of the optomechanical coupling scales as the square - root of the mean intracavity photon number , @xmath37 .",
