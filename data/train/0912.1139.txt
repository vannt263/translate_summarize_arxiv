    "relativistic jets have been observed in a number of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) containing black holes ( bhs ) and neutron stars ( nss ; see fender 2006 for a review ) .",
    "recently , krding et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found evidence for a transient jet in a binary system containing a white dwarf , confirming that the existence of jets in such systems does not depend on the nature of the compact object .",
    "the most studied and best known jet sources are the bh systems , because they are typically much brighter in the radio band ( migliari & fender 2006 ; krding et al .",
    "the radio band is the observing window where the jet emission routinely dominates over the other radiative components in xrbs ( companion star , disk ) .",
    "low - luminosity bhs - less than a few % of the eddington limit - are characterized by an optically thick , flat or slightly inverted , synchrotron radio spectrum ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the flux density at the frequency @xmath12 ; fender 2001 ) .",
    "this optically thick synchrotron emission is interpreted as a spectral signature of conical continuously replenished , self - absorbed compact jets ( developed to model steady jets in agn : blandford & knigl 1979 ; see also hjellming & johnston 1988 ; falcke & biermann 1995 ; kaiser 2006 ) .",
    "this interpretation has been confirmed by radio imaging of the milli - arcsec scale jets , for two galactic bh xrbs : cyg x-1 ( stirling et al .",
    "2001 ) and grs  1915 + 105 ( dhawan , mirabel & rodrguez 2000 ) . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "compact jet models predict a ` break ' from an optically thick to an optically thin synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this optically thin spectrum represents the emission from the part of the jet that is closer to the base which is transparent to its emitting synchrotron radiation .",
    "this break of the jet spectrum has been inferred with spectral fitting to be in the ir / optical range ( nowak et al .",
    "2005 ) , and actually detected in two bhs , gx  339 - 4 ( corbel & fender 2002 ) and xte j1118 + 480 ( hynes et al .",
    "the accretion state where the compact jet is active corresponds to the ` hard state ' as defined in mcclintock & remillard ( 2006 ) or homan & belloni ( 2005 ) . in such a state ,",
    "the x - ray band is dominated by a non - thermal power - law emission , which can be detectable up to hundreds of kev .",
    "most of the bhs show a cut - off around 100 - 200 kev , but an extra power - law extending up the mev has also been observed in cyg  x-1(e.g .",
    "mcconnel et al .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed to describe the origin of this hard x - ray tail , with the main processes being inverse compton scattering from a population of thermal or hybrid thermal / non - thermal hot electrons in a ` corona ' whose geometry is still an area of debate ( e.g. narayan et al .",
    "1997 ; esin et al .",
    "1996 ; poutanen & coppi 1998 ; merloni 2003 ; poutanen & vurm 2009 ; see also titarchuk et al .",
    "1996 for the bulk motion comptonization proposal ) , synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission from the base of a jet , or a combination of the two ( e.g. markoff , nowak & wilms 2005 ; migliari et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the jet phenomenology observed in bhs can be found also in ns x - ray binaries .",
    "the radio detection of low - luminosity ns xrbs and brightness temperature arguments strongly indicate that also nss in their ` hard state ' produce jets ( migliari et al .",
    "in particular , the detection of the infra - red ( ir ) optically - thin break in the synchrotron spectrum of 4u  0614 + 091 brought the evidence that a jet of the same kind observed in agn and galactic bhs , modeled as a compact jet _ a la _ blandford & knigl ( 1979 ) can be formed in a ns system ( migliari et al .",
    "2006 ) . from a direct comparison of the ratio of radiative jet power to x - ray bolometric power , l@xmath14/l@xmath15 , in 4u  0614 + 091 and in bhs",
    ", we found that in bhs l@xmath14/l@xmath15 is about two orders of magnitude higher .",
    "this difference might be explained by a difference in the role of the jet as a power output channel in the two types of systems : bhs are jet - dominated ( fender et al .",
    "2004 ) while nss never enter a jet dominated regime ( migliari & fender 2006 ) .",
    "nss , like bhs , also show non - thermal hard x - ray tails up to hundreds of kev , typically with cutoff at lower energies than bhs , at around 50  kev , which are well modeled by thermal comptonization in a hot corona ( e.g. barret et al . 2000 ; medvedev & narayan 2001 ; maccarone & coppi 2003 ; done & gierliski 2003 ; paizis et al .",
    "2006 and references therein for bright z - type nss ; e.g. fiocchi et al . 2008 for 4u  0614 + 091 ) .",
    "the contemporaneous detection of the hard tail and the optically - thin part of the jet would give crucial hints on the possible role of the jet in the hard non - thermal x - ray emission of nss .",
    "4u  0614 + 091 is an ultra - compact ns xrb ( bradt et al .",
    "1992 ; juett et al .",
    "2001 ) , with a possible period of 51  min ( shahbaz et al 2008a ) , and is the closest to us at a distance of 3.2  kpc ( the distance was recently estimated , with an error of @xmath16 , thanks to the observation of an x - ray burst showing a photospheric radius expansion : kuulkers et al .",
    "2009 , kuulkers et al 2003 ) . given the ultra - compact nature of the system , the small accretion disk and the faint white dwarf or he - rich partially degenerated companion do not emit significantly in the mid - ir band , which is dominated by the optically thin emission of the jet .",
    "4u  0614 + 091 is also a hard x - ray source , showing non - thermal emission above 100  kev ( e.g. fiocchi et al .",
    "the source is about 90% of its time in a steady ` hard state ' , as defined for atoll - type sources ( e.g. van straaten et al .",
    "2000 ) . making a parallel with bhs",
    ", we expect the compact jet to be active in this state .",
    "we have observed the ns xrb 4u  0614 + 091 simultaneously in the radio band with the very large array ( vla ) , in mid - infrared and infrared ( ir ) with the spitzer space telescope , in near - ir / optical with the ground - based small and moderate aperture research telescope system ( smarts ) , in the optical and soft x - rays with swift and in soft and hard x - rays with the rossi - x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , covering a range from 4.86  ghz to 200  kev .",
    "4u0614 + 091 was observed with the vla in its relatively compact c - configuration on november 12 , 2006 .",
    "the observation at 8.46 ghz started at 09:26:45 ut with an exposure time of 290.4 min and the observation at 4.86 ghz started at 05:07:58 ut with an exposure time of 290.7 min .",
    "3c48 was used as the primary calibrator , setting the flux density scale according to coefficients derived at the vla in 1999.2 by staff at national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "the secondary calibrator was j0613 + 1306 , 4.0@xmath17 away from the target source .",
    "six of the twenty - six telescopes in the array were retrofitted evla antennas , necessitating the determination of baseline - based gain solutions to prevent closure errors on evla - vla baselines due to mismatched bandpass shapes .",
    "the observing frequencies were 8.46 and 4.86ghz , and the observing bandwidth was 50mhz in both cases .",
    "data were reduced according to standard procedures in the 31dec08 version of aips ( greisen 2003 ) using a clean component model to determine the gain solutions for the primary calibrator . since the source was so faint , no self - calibration was performed .",
    "the source flux density and position were measured after deconvolution by fitting the source as a point source and as an elliptical gaussian in the image plane .",
    "we observed 4u  0614 + 091 with spitzer / irac on october 30 2006 starting at 17:41:39 ut for 384 s and with spitzer / mips on november 3 , 2006 starting at 06:57:43 ut for 3371 s. we have processed the @xmath18 m mips and the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8  @xmath0 m irac basic calibrated data using the software mopex ( makovoz & marleau 2005 ) , following the procedure as in the manuals available on line .",
    "we created a mosaic from the 280 and 10 frames per band obtained in the mips and irac observations , respectively , and we extracted the source flux using aperture photometry .",
    "we have corrected the irac flux densities for interstellar extinction using @xmath19 [ derived from the equivalent hydrogen column density values in juett , psaltis & chakrabarty ( 2001 ) and using @xmath20 in predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) ] , and following the standard optical - to - ir interstellar extinction law with 0.55  @xmath0 m as a reference frequency for the v band ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ; cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "these de - reddening values calculated from the x - ray spectra have to be considered upper limits ( juett et al .",
    "however , studies of the optical spectra of the source indicate that the reddening of the object should be close to the maximum in the galaxy in its direction ( see nelemans et al .",
    "therefore , we use these values ( also adopted in nelemans et al .",
    "2004 ) as a fair approximation also for smarts and swift / uvot flux corrections , with an uncertainty of @xmath21 ( bohlin et al .",
    "1978 ) . for spitzer ,",
    "the corrections for interstellar extinction are small , i.e. @xmath22 for the flux density at @xmath23 m and less than 5% for the flux densities in the other three irac bands .",
    "no extinction correction was made at @xmath18 m . we add , quadratically to the rms , a 5% and 10% systematic error on the estimate of the flux densities in the irac and mips observations , respectively , to take into account the uncertainties on the photometric calibration ( see reach et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "4u  0614 + 091 was observed on october 30 , 2006 at 05:31 ut for 660s using the andicam dual - channel optical / ir camera on the smarts 1.3 m telescope at cerro - tololo , chile .",
    "optical photometry was obtained in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands , and infrared in the @xmath26 band .",
    "the data were reduced in iraf using standard procedures . in the optical ,",
    "differential photometry was performed relative to a bright comparison star in the field , and this star was then calibrated on several nights in 2007 january relative to multiple stars in the standard field ru  149 ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "ir data were obtained in a 5-point dither pattern , and combined before measuring the brightness of the target relative to a nearby star in the field from the 2mass catalog .",
    "we have applied de - reddening corrections as described in   [ data_spitzer ] .",
    "we analyzed the _",
    "swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and uv - optical telescope ( uvot ) data from the observation of 4u  0614 + 091 that started on 2006 october 30 , at 17:36 ut for 3256 s ( obsid 00030812001 ) .",
    "we used the windowed timing mode for the xrt and obtained a total xrt exposure time of 3,256 s. we reduced the xrt data in 2008 may using the heasoft v6.4.1 software .",
    "we used the heasoft routine xselect to produce source and background spectra . for the source spectrum",
    ", we included photons from the cleaned event list that are within @xmath27 of the source centroid , and we used a background region that is the same size but is offset by @xmath28 .",
    "after background subtraction , we measured a count rate of 44 counts  s@xmath4 for the source .",
    "we generated a response using the calibration files that were current in 2008 may .",
    "for the uvot data , we started by using the heasoft routine uvotimsum to sum the images for the different filters used .",
    "then , we defined source and background regions and used uvot2pha to produce the spectra and response files , from which we obtained the flux measurements given in table  1 for the v , b , u , uvw1 , and uvm2 filters . we have applied de - reddening corrections as described in   [ data_spitzer ] .",
    "note that , contrary to the ir band , the extinction correction in the uv spectrum are large , up to 26% .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty on the de - reddening value can be significant .      for the energy spectral analysis , we combined the data taken on the 30 october , 2008 , i.e. the observations 92411 - 01 - 06 - 07 and 92411 - 01 - 06 - 00 for a total exposure time of 4160 s. we have used pca standard2 of all the pcus available , and hexte standard mode cluster b data . for the pca data , we have subtracted the background estimated using pcabackest v.3.0 , produced the detector response matrix with pcarsp v.10.1 , and analyzed the energy spectra in the range 320  kev .",
    "a systematic error of 0.5% was added to account for uncertainties in the calibration . for the hexte data",
    ", we corrected for deadtime , subtracted the background , extracted the response matrix using heasoft v.6.4.1 .",
    "we have analyzed the hexte spectra between 20 and @xmath29  kev .",
    "in fig .  [ sed ] we show the spectral energy distribution of 4u  0614 + 091 .",
    "we detected for the first time the radio counterpart at the coordinates : ra @xmath30 , dec @xmath31 , consistent with the optical position of 4u  0614 + 091 in the usno b1.0 catalog : ra @xmath32 , dec @xmath33 .    using our new vla radio position in 2006 and the optical position of the usno b1.0 catalog in 1978 , we derive a proper motion upper limit of @xmath34  mas in ra and @xmath35  mas in dec , while the expected lsr offset is of -13.4  mas in ra and 4.2  mas in dec .",
    "the average proper motion of isolated pulsars due to the supernovae kick is 200 - 500  km / s , which would correspond to @xmath36 mas at the distance of 4u  0614 + 091 , over the 28 years between 1978 and 2006 ( e.g. , lyne & lorimer 1994 ; lorimer et al .",
    "1997 ; cordes & chernoff 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , our upper limits indicate that 4u  0614 + 091 received a relatively small kick , below - average compared to isolated pulsars .",
    "fitting the radio source as a point source , we measure a peak flux density of @xmath37  mjy / beam at 4.86  ghz and @xmath38  mjy at 8.46  ghz .",
    "these fluxes give a radio spectral index of @xmath39 .",
    "analyzing the two observations on november 1 and 2 separately , we measure a flux density , respectively at 8.46  ghz and 4.86  ghz , of @xmath40  mjy and @xmath41  mjy on november 1 and of @xmath42  mjy and @xmath43 on november 2 .",
    "this indicates variability on timescales of less than one day .",
    "moreover , the source was further detected at 4.86  ghz on march 27 , 2008 with a flux density of @xmath44  mjy ( see   [ discussion_imaging ] ) . and on may 31 , 2009 with a flux density of @xmath45  mjy .",
    "a previous radio observation of 4u  0614 + 091 , taken on april 24 , 2001 gave a non detection with a @xmath46 upper limit of @xmath47  mjy at 4.86  ghz ( migliari & fender 2006 ) .",
    "comparing with the rxte / asm light curve of 4u  0614 + 091 , we note that when the source was not detected in the radio band on april 24 , 2001 , 4u  0614 + 091 was in an unusual low - flux x - ray state . on the other hand , in all the other observations when the radio counterpart was detected ,",
    "a higher x - ray flux with rapid weekly flares and consequent fast transition to a softer state are observed ( kuulkers et al .",
    "this is somewhat similar to what has been observed in the ns xrb 4u  1728 - 34 , where the radio emission was stronger when the source was in a higher luminosity state , close to the state transition between the hard ( island ) and the lower - soft ( lower - banana ) state ( migliari et al . 2003 ) .",
    "spitzer / mips detected 4u  0614 + 091 at @xmath18 m with a flux density of @xmath48  mjy ( see table  1 ) . the radio - to - mid - ir spectral index is consistent with being flat with a spectral index @xmath49 , indicating an optically thick synchrotron spectrum up to the mid - ir ( fig .",

    "fluxes and spectral indexes are consistent with the previous irac detections of the source on october 25 , 2005 ( migliari et al .",
    "2006 ) . the quasi - simultaneous observations with mips and irac allowed us , for the first time , to detect the spectral break between the optically - thick and optically - thin portions of the synchrotron spectrum in a compact jet from a ns xrb , for which we only had upper limits .",
    "( note that the soft x - ray emission of the source remains steady between the irac and the mips observations . )",
    "the break frequency is constrained to be @xmath58  hz @xmath59  hz .",
    "the near - ir data taken with smarts show the rayleigh - jeans tail of a thermal black - body like emission ( as already observed with non - simultaneous data in migliari et al .",
    "we note that the swift / uvot fluxes in the optical / uv show a shape that resembles the spectrum of a single temperature black body from a star or that of an irradiated disk with an optical hump ( e.g. hynes et al .",
    "however , given the faint white dwarf or he - rich partially degenerated companion ( e.g. nelemans et al .",
    "2004 , shahbaz et al .",
    "2008a ) , we expect the disk emission to dominate over the star .",
    "furthermore , with the small disk of this ultra - compact xrb , we also expect the hump due to irradiation of the disk to be more towards the far - uv",
    ". this unexpected spectral shape might be due to the uncertainties in the de - reddening , which become larger and significant in the uv ( see   [ data_swift ] ) .",
    "the continuum of the x - ray spectrum has been modeled in the range 0.6 - 100  kev using multi - temperature disk black body and a black body with temperatures of @xmath60  kev and @xmath61  kev , respectively interpreted as the emission from the disk and the surface of the ns , plus a power law with spectral index @xmath62 , to account for the non - thermal x - ray emission which is observed without any evidence for a cutoff up to 100  kev .",
    "two gaussian emission lines are also needed : one around @xmath63  kev , possibly an oxygen line ( see piraino et al .",

    "the lack of statistics and the fact that the break frequency has been observed to vary within the same source ( in gx  339 - 4 ) , possibly in relation to variations of the bolometric luminosity , makes it premature to generalize any possible relation between the @xmath81 and the nature of the compact object .",
    "however , under certain assumptions , we can make some considerations on their possible dependency , as follows .",
    "the break frequency is the frequency above which the jet is fully transparent to its emitting synchrotron radiation .",
    "the association between this break frequency and the geometrical parameters of the jet is still unknown .",

    "the observation with the lower bolometric luminosity shows the higher @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , assuming that at a higher bolometric luminosity corresponds a higher mass accretion rate , the predicted positive dependence of the @xmath81 to the @xmath83 seems to be in contrast with the observations of the bh gx  339 - 4 .",

    "there is an anticorrelation between the accretion power ( i.e. x - ray bolometric luminosity ) and the break frequency in the two gx  339 - 4 observations , therefore , if the accretion power@xmath81 variations do not depend on the nature of the compact object , we would expect 4u  0614 + 091 to have a higher break frequency than gx  339 - 4 .",
    "the lower break frequency observed in 4u  0614 + 091 would therefore point towards either a different jet formation mechanism between bhs and nss or a different geometry of the jet ( smaller in the ns ) or less power channeled into the jet ( i.e. the disk - jet symbiosis hypothesis is not valid ) , maybe due to an effect of the specific compact object , such as the presence of the magnetic field in the ns .",
    "given the x - ray bolometric luminosity of @xmath90 erg s@xmath4 and using @xmath91 , the integral of the optically thin part of the synchrotron spectrum , from the thin - thick break frequency , is @xmath92e@xmath6 erg / s , where e@xmath7 is the high - energy cutoff of the synchrotron spectrum in ev .",

    "the source was observed on march 27 , 2008 at 4.86  ghz .",
    "the standalone data from the phased vla measured a source with flux density @xmath99  mjy , 30% less than the flux density measured during our multiwavelength campaign ( table  1 ) ; this is indicative of radio variability",
    ". however , the short duration of the observations , together with the extremely high sensitivity of the three big dishes ( the gbt , phased vla , and especially arecibo ) meant that the side - lobes of the naturally - weighted dirty beam were too high ( 91% of the peak ) to identify accurately the source ( with a nominal rms of @xmath100jy ) , particularly given the lack of an accurate position from other wavelengths .",
    "the vla was in c configuration at the time , giving a position accurate to 200 mas , with respect to an hsa beamsize of @xmath101  mas@xmath102 .",
    "a compact jet as inferred from our spectral study ( this work ) has never been spatially resolved .",
    "hard x - ray tails in x - ray binaries are well fitted with a model where thermal accretion disk seed photons are compton up - scattered by a ` corona ' of hot plasma .",
    "markoff , nowak & wilms ( 2005 ) analyzed a sample of bh xrbs energy spectra and showed that fits of the hard x - ray tails using jet model s components ( i.e. synchrotron and ssc ) are statistically as good as single - component comptonizing corona models ( i.e. eqpair ; coppi 1999 ) .",
    "this result would be in agreement with the possibility that the ` corona ' of hot plasma might be in fact the base of the jet itself , at least in bhs .",
    "in ns x - ray binaries the hard x - ray tails can also be well fitted by corona comptonizing models with thermal electron with temperatures of 25 - 30  kev for low - luminosity nss ( e.g. barret et al . 2000 ) tens of kev for accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars ( e.g. gierlinski , done & barret 2002 ; poutanen & gierlinski 2003 ; gierlinski & poutanen 2005 ; falanga et al .",
    "2005a , falanga et al",
    ". 2005b , falanga et al . 2007 ) and a few kev for brighter sources ( e.g. paizis et al . 2006 ) .",
    "fits of energy spectra using the broadband jet model have not been attempted yet for nss . in this work ,",
    "we have detected both the optically - thin spectrum of the jet and the hard x - ray tail in 4u  0614 + 091 .",
    "therefore , we are able for the first time to explore the possibility that in nss , like bhs , the high - energy non - thermal energy spectrum might be reproduced , at least partially , with radiative processes taking place in the jet .    from the broadband spectrum in fig .",
    "[ sed ] , left , we see that the synchrotron emission alone , estimated as the extrapolation of the optically - thin jet spectrum observed , at high energies ( dashed line ) , can not reproduce the high - energy x - ray tail observed ( as it does in e.g. the bh gx  339 - 4 ; corbel & fender 2002 ) . as a first step , we test whether the hard x - ray tail could be produced by ssc emission from the same population which produces the synchrotron emission ( i.e. post - shock accelerated jet ; markoff , nowak & wilms 2005 ) .",
    "we therefore constructed a simple , robust one - zone model for both synchrotron and ssc emission ( e.g. , kirk , rieger , & mastichiadis 1998 ) .",
    "the emission region is taken to be a cylinder with variable aspect ratio and size , with the same population of electrons being responsible for synchrotron and inverse compton emission .",
    "this simple model is appropriate , given that both the observed optically thin synchrotron tail and the ssc emission should come from the base of the jet ( where photon and particle densities are highest ) .",
    "different geometries ( e.g. , spherical ) change the results only by factors of order unity .    assuming uniform plasma density and isotropic synchrotron emission in the frame of the plasma ,",
    "the ssc emission is then calculated analytically ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "since the emission is unresolved the problem is underconstrained and we have several free parameters at our disposal that can be varied in order to find a suitable ssc solution that is consistent with the observed spectrum :    * radius and length of the cylindrical emission region . * the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting plasma . *",
    "the viewing angle of the jet ( relative to the direction of motion ) * the lower cutoff frequency of the synchrotron spectrum at the base of the jet ( which is unobservable due to self - absorption ) .",
    "the remaining parameters are determined by the observed synchrotron luminosity and spectrum .",
    "we then attempt to match the observed hard tail by varying the free model parameters .",
    "we find that matching the observed high x - ray flux is not feasible for reasonable physical parameters : for reasonable jet bulk lorentz factors of order @xmath103 , the observed flux would require unrealistically low magnetic field values , roughly @xmath104 ( that is , the field is four orders of magnitude out of equipartition ) . for reasonable magnetic field values , with a @xmath105",
    ", the required lorentz factors would require a bulk lorentz factor of order 50 or larger , with a viewing angle close to @xmath106 .",
    "roughly , the relationship between the equipartition fraction @xmath107 and @xmath108 is @xmath109 .",
    "however , even if the jet is either extremely undermagnetized or extremely relativistic , the spectral slope of the predicted ssc emission is too hard to match the observed x - ray spectrum : the optically thin synchrotron spectrum , which is imprinted on the ssc spectral slope , is -0.47 , while the observed hard tail has a spectral slope of -1.25 .",
    "we conclude that ssc emission alone , from the post - shock jet particles , is _ not _ a viable mechanism to explain the observed hard x - ray tail of ns 4u  0614 + 091 .",
    "this result indicates that an extra comptonizing population of hot plasma apart from that producing the direct synchrotron emission in the jet , exists close to the ns in the form of a corona where the hard x - ray emission is associated with the accretion disk boundary layers ( e.g. mitzuda et al . 1984 ; kluniak & wilson 1991 ) , a hot inner flow , an adaf ( narayan et al . 1996 ; barret et al .",
    "2000 ; medvedev & narayan 2001 ; see also the discussion in done & gierlinsky 2003 ) , a mildly - outflowing corona ( e.g. beloborodov 1999 ) , or a pre - shock , quasi - thermal , component at the base of the jet ( markoff & nowak 2004 ) . to assess in particular this last possibility ,",
    "a broadband fit of the spectrum with a disk - jet model is necessary .",
    "we present here the most complete energy spectrum of the ns xrb 4u  0614 + 091 to date , from the radio to the hard x - ray band .",
    "_ 2 ) _ we detected for the first time the source at @xmath18 m and obtained the first measurement of the actual ` break frequency ' of the compact jet spectrum in a ns xrb , which is @xmath1  hz (   [ results ] ) .        _ 5 ) _ there is an anti - correlation between the accretion power ( i.e. x - ray bolometric luminosity ) and the break frequency in the two observations of the bh gx  339 - 4 where the synchrotron ir break frequency has been observed .",
    "this seems to be in contrast with the prescription : @xmath84 , in the disk - jet symbiosis hypothesis .",
    "moreover , in 4u  0614 + 091 both the accretion power and the synchrotron break frequency are lower than that in the bh .",
    "this is in contrast with the trend observed in gx  339 - 4 , pointing towards either a different jet formation mechanism between bhs and nss or a different geometry of the jet ( smaller in the ns ) maybe due to an effect of the specific compact object on the jet power , such as the presence of the magnetic field in the ns (   [ discussion_jetspec ] ) .",
    "_ 6 ) _ the lower limit on the radiative jet power is @xmath3  erg s@xmath4 ( i.e. observed up to 0.3 ev ) and the total jet power is @xmath94e@xmath6  erg / s ( where e@xmath7 is the high - energy cutoff of the synchrotron spectrum in ev and @xmath8 is the radiative efficiency in units of 0.05 )",
    ". the lower limit on the fraction of the accreting bolometric power l@xmath15 channeled into the jet is l@xmath96/l@xmath15@xmath97e@xmath98 .",
    "_ 7 ) _ the detection of the optically thin part of the jet together with the x - ray tail above 30 kev , allowed us to assess the possible jet contribution to the non - thermal hard x - ray emission via synchrotron self - compton processes .",
    "we conclude that post - shock ssc emission alone is _ not _ a viable mechanism to explain the observed hard x - ray tail of 4u  0614 + 091 .",
    "this result points towards the existence of an extra comptonizing region as an adaf corona , or a pre - shock , quasi - thermal component at the base of the jet (   [ discussion_hardtail ] ) .    _",
    "8) _ we measured no significant variations of the ir with respect to the previous irac observation , both taken in 2006 .",
    "the radio emission varied from @xmath110  mjy in 2001 to @xmath60  mjy in 2006 and to @xmath99 mjy in 2008 (   [ discussion_imaging ] ) .",
    "the low radio upper limit in 2001 might be related to a steady , low - luminosity x - ray state .    _ 9 ) _ we found the spectral evidence that in 4u  0614 + 091 a compact jet of the same kind observed in bhs ( stellar mass and agn ) exists .",
    "this , together with the fact that the system is located at a distance of only @xmath111  kpc , make this source our best candidate in order to try to spatially resolve its jet with high - spatial resolution radio interferometry .",
