    "events containing a high @xmath6 isolated electron or muon and associated with missing transverse momentum have been observed at hera @xcite .",
    "an excess of hera  i data events ( 19942000 , mostly in @xmath4 collisions ) compared to the sm prediction at large hadronic transverse momentum @xmath7 was reported by the h1 collaboration @xcite , which was not confirmed by the zeus collaboration , although the analysis was performed in a more restricted phase space @xcite .    the main sm contribution to the signal topology",
    "is the production of real @xmath5 bosons via photoproduction with subsequent leptonic decay @xmath8(@xmath9)@xmath10 , where the hadronic system @xmath10 is typically of low @xmath6 .",
    "the equivalent charged current process @xmath11@xmath12(@xmath9)@xmath10 also contributes to the total signal rate , although only at a level of around 7% .",
    "the production of @xmath13 bosons with subsequent decay to neutrinos @xmath14(@xmath15)@xmath10 results in a further minor contribution to the total signal rate in the electron channel at a level of 3% .",
    "the event selection employed by the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite analyses are very similar and may be summarised as follows : the identified lepton should have high transverse momentum @xmath16  10  gev , be observed in the central region of the detector and be isolated with respect to jets and other tracks in the event .",
    "the event should also contain a large transverse momentum imbalance , @xmath17  12  gev .",
    "further cuts are then applied , which are designed to reduce sm background , whilst preserving a high level of signal purity .",
    "event quantities sensitive to the presence of high energy undetected particles in the event are employed such as the azimuthal balance of the event , the difference in azimuthal angle between the lepton and the hadronic system and the longitudinal momentum imbalance . to ensure that the two lepton channels are exclusive and",
    "may therefore be combined , electron events must contain no isolated muons .",
    "both h1 and zeus have recently performed the analysis of the electron and muon channels  3.2 . ] on their respective complete hera i+ii data sets , which correspond to approximately 0.5  fb@xmath1 per experiment @xcite .",

    "the observed data excess in the hera  i @xmath4 data thus remains at the 3.0@xmath18 level for the complete h1 @xmath4 dataset . in the zeus analysis of the complete hera  i+ii data , 41 data events are observed in agreement with the sm prediction of 48.3  @xmath2  6.8 . unlike in the h1 analysis , agreement between data and sm is also observed in the high @xmath7 region , where 11 events are seen in the @xmath19 data compared to a sm prediction of 13.1  @xmath2  1.8 .",
    "a study of the selection efficiency for signal process using the event generator epvec @xcite found the h1 and zeus analyses to be compatible in the kinematic region where they are directly comparable @xcite . the majority of the data events observed by h1 at @xmath3 25  gev are also found to fall into the region of overlap of the two analyses . nevertheless , in order to coherently combine the results from the two experiments , a common phase space has been established .",
    "the common selection is based on the h1 event selection @xcite , but over a more restricted lepton polar angle range of 15  @xmath20  120  @xmath21 , as employed in the zeus analysis @xcite .",
    "the signal expectation rates of the h1 and zeus analyses using the common selection are found to be comparable , taking into account the respective luminosities of the data sets and the signal processes included .",
    "more details on the combination of the h1 and zeus analyses can be found in @xcite .",
