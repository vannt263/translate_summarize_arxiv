    "quantum entanglement or inseparability plays a major role in all branches of quantum information and quantum computation .",
    "peres@xcite proposed a criterion for checking the inseparability of a state by introducing the partial transpose operation .",
    "this condition is necessary and sufficient for some lower dimensional discrete bipartite systems but is no longer sufficient for higher dimensions@xcite . despite many studies on the discrete states , much attentions have been paid to the continuous variable states @xcite .",
    "recently , quantum teleportation of coherent states has been experimentally realized by exploiting a two - mode squeezed vacuum state as an entanglement resource@xcite . due to the decohence of the environment",
    ", a pure entanglement state will become mixed .",
    "thus it is important to know if a given bipartite continuous variable state is entangled or not .",
    "the decoherence may be caused by coupling to the thermal noise of the environment , amplitude damping , quantum dissipation and phase damping . besides the phase damping , the other three types of decoherence preserve gaussian property of the state , and a two - mode squeezed vacuum state will evolve to a two mode gaussian mixed state . for the separability of two mode gaussian state ,",
    "the positivity of the partially transposed state is necessary and sufficient @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "however , a gaussian state will evolve to a non - gaussian one by phase damping , and the case of a two mode squeezed vacuum state under the only decoherence of phase damping was perfectly solved@xcite . in real experiments ,",
    "the general situation which should be taken into account is the coexistence of noise , amplitude and phase damping .",
    "theoretically , the separability and entanglement of non - gaussian state are seldom investigated , here we provide an example .",
    "considering the simultaneous damping , the density matrix obeys the following master equation in the interaction picture @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the amplitude damping part @xmath2,\\ ] ] with @xmath3 the average photon number of the thermal environment .",
    "and @xmath4 is the phase damping part ( e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath5.\\ ] ] the state can be equivalently specified by its characteristic function .",

    "we now give out the phase damping equation of @xmath16 , it will be @xmath20 if we denote @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "we can see that with the characteristic function the amplitude damping equation is described by the amplitude of the parameter @xmath23 the phase damping equation is described by the phase of the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the solution to the phase equation of @xmath16 then will be @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the abbreviation of @xmath27$].the simultaneous amplitude and phase damping to any initial characteristic function then will be @xmath28\\chi \\left ( \\mu _ ie^{-\\frac{% \\gamma _",

    "we will concentrate on the simultaneous amplitude and phase damping of two - mode @xmath29 symmetric gaussain state@xcite whose characteristic function is @xmath30.$ ] .",

    "the integral on @xmath34 is one fold , for simplicity , we denote @xmath35f(x)dx$ ] as @xmath36 the @xmath29 symmetric gaussain state set is a quite large set .",
    "it contains two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the squeezing parameter ) and two - mode squeezed thermal state @xcite as its special cases , with @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 respectively .",
    "for the sake of simplicity in description , let us firstly consider the situation of @xmath43 the general case will be obtained straightforward and be described at the end of this section .",
    "the first question is that if the state after damping is entangled or not",
    ". then how much is the entanglement left ?",
    "the necessary condition of a bipartite state being entangled is that the partial transpose of the density operator is not positive definite @xcite .",
    "the partial transpose operation changes the characteristic function in the fashion of : @xmath44 @xmath45 for the separability of a non - gaussian bipartite state , a necessary condition was proposed by simon@xcite in terms of the second moment of the state . in the original literature canonical operators were used , here we use creation and annihilation operators instead .",
    "the necessary condition comes from the non - negativity of @xmath46 and the commutation relations . for any @xmath47 with @xmath48 of every set of complex coefficients @xmath49",
    ", one has @xmath50 @xmath51 hence the second moment matrix of @xmath46 should be semi - positive definite .",
    "the second moment such as @xmath52 can be obtained from the second derivative of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 where @xmath55 . other necessary conditions may come from when @xmath56 is the linear combination of higher power of the creation and annihilation operators , and they may be tighter than ineq.([wave1 ] ) . and",
    "this is really the case .",
    "we will find a tighter condition by exploring the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the density operator .",
    "the eigenequation of @xmath57 can be simplified as the eigenequations of a serials of matrices ( see appendix ) .",
    "@xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 when @xmath61 , one has the first eigenvalue @xmath62 which is always positive .",
    "the matrix @xmath63 possesses the symmetry of @xmath64 , so that it can be reduced , and we get more analytical solutions .",
    "the negative eigenvalues may appear at @xmath65 @xmath66 and so on .",
    "hence one of the necessary conditions of the non - negativity of @xmath67 , so that the necessary condition of a damped state @xmath68 is ppt separable is that @xmath69    we will prove that this condition is also sufficient for ppt separability.we turn to the detail properties of matrix @xmath63",
    ". the necessary condition of separability comes from @xmath70 is @xmath71 , this is a trivial result compared with ineq.([wave2 ] ) we have checked other solvable eigenvalues for necessary condition of separability .",
    "they are also trivial compared with ineq.([wave2 ] ) .",
    "it may be anticipated that separable conditions come from all other @xmath63 are weaker than ineq.([wave2 ] ) , that is ineq.([wave2 ] ) is also a sufficient condition of ppt separability . to prove this",
    ", we just need to consider the ppt separability at the case of @xmath72 .",
    "because if a state corresponding to @xmath73 is ppt separable , then another state with stronger phase damping ( with increasing @xmath74 while preserving all other parameters unchanged ) is definitely ppt separable , for this stronger phase damping state we have @xmath75 and it is ppt separable .",
    "our proof of the ppt separability of the state at @xmath72 is not a most general proof .",
    "we can only prove the non - negativity of @xmath63 by algebraic programming up to @xmath76 at the case of @xmath72 .",
    "denote @xmath77 and let @xmath78 ( with its elements @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) be the @xmath81-th main submatrix of @xmath82 , then to prove the non - negativity of @xmath63 is to prove that the determinants of all @xmath78 are not negative .",
    "the algebraic programming gives @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 is a polynomial of @xmath86 with all its coefficients being positive integer , @xmath87 is some integer rely on @xmath81 .",
    "the algebraic programming runs for all @xmath88 and proves the non - negativity of @xmath63 .",
    "we suggest that @xmath63 is also non - negative for @xmath89 , but this is not verified because of the computing time of the algebraic programming .",
    "another direct way of proving comes from perturbation theory .",
    "firstly @xmath90 can always be symmetrized .",
    "the zero order matrix is @xmath91 which is just the case of gaussian state , and all its eigenvalues and eigenvectors are well known . so that the first order and second order perturbation of the eigenvalues of @xmath63 can be obtained .",
    "a more concise way to obtain the perturbation result is as follows : in the eigenequation of characteristic function , if we use @xmath92 as a test wave function , we then get a matrix ( see appendix ) @xmath93\\sum_k\\binom{m - n}{l - k}\\binom nk   \\label{wave7 } \\\\ & & ( c+d\\cos x)^{m - n - l+k}(c - d\\cos x)^k(-1)^{l - k}(id\\sin x)^{l+n-2k }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a linear transformation of @xmath63 and has the same eigenvalues .",
    "the zero order of @xmath94 is the matrix @xmath95 which is a diagonal matrix .",
    "hence eigenvalues up to the first order perturbation of @xmath94 are simply @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath97 is quite small , @xmath98 can be approximated as @xmath99 with @xmath100.\\ ] ] for odd @xmath101 , the @xmath102 eigenvalue of the zero order approximation is negative .",
    "if @xmath103 is also negative , then the @xmath102 eigenvalue of the first order approximation becomes positive . for given @xmath97 and @xmath104 we can always find sufficient large @xmath105 and proper @xmath101 so that @xmath103 is negative ,",
    "hence the eigenvalues with large @xmath105 become positive faster than that with small @xmath105 under phase damping .",
    "we need to know at what condition all original negative eigenvalues become positive or zero .",
    "it is easy to obtained that when @xmath106 , @xmath103 reaches its maximum .",
    "hence when @xmath107 @xmath108 that is @xmath109 all other odd @xmath101 negative eigenvalue become positive .",
    "ineq.([wave5 ] ) is the first order approximation of ineq.([wave2 ] ) .",
    "hence at the sense of first order approximation ineq.([wave2 ] ) is sufficient for a state to be ppt  separable .    as a by product , we can use matrices @xmath63 to calculate the logarithmic negativity which is an entanglement measure itself @xcite and provides an upper bound to the distillable entanglement@xcite .",
    "it can be seen in the figure when @xmath110the logarithmic negativity is zero , while it is positive when @xmath111 .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath97 , the negativity of the state can be estimated .",
    "it is the absolute of the summation of all eigenvalues with odd @xmath101 .",
    "the result will be @xmath112 ^ 2}.$ ]    one of the most important quantities of a state @xmath15 is its entropy @xmath113 .",
    "the entropy of our damped state can be obtained by solving the characteristic function eigenequation which is @xmath114 @xmath115 after integrals on @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath34 , then compare the coefficients of each @xmath118 item of the two side , one can get a series of matrices @xmath119 whose eigenvalues are that of the damped state @xmath15 and @xmath120 the entropy of the state @xmath15 will be @xmath121 the reduced state of @xmath122 is @xmath123 with its characteristic function @xmath124 $ ] , hence its entropy is @xmath125 it has been proven that the coherent information @xmath126 provides lower bound of distillable entanglement of the state@xcite . the coherent information is calculated and plotted in the figure . at time @xmath127",
    "the coherent information turns to zero . in the figure we have @xmath128 , but for other parameters",
    "we may have @xmath129 .",
    ".,height=288 ]    we have investigated the symmetric damping setting of the two mode squeezed thermal state , that is , the two modes undergo the same damping and noise .",
    "the generalization to asymmetric damping setting and @xmath29 symmetric gaussian state is straightforward with the method developed here .",
    "denote @xmath130 @xmath131 the @xmath63 matrix will be @xmath132 the whole issue of the positivity of the asymmetric setting is equivalent that of symmetric setting and omitted here .",
    "the necessary and sufficient criterion of the ppt separability of the state will be    @xmath133    and the ppt sufficient criterion is again obtained at the sense of algebraic programming and perturbation theory .",
    "ineq.([wave1 ] ) will be generalized to @xmath134",
    "we will prove that @xmath135 is the sufficient condition of the separability of the damped state @xmath15 .",
    "let us first consider a gaussain density operator @xmath136 with its characteristic function @xmath137 $ ] .",
    "the fourier transformation of @xmath138 is a probability distribution function ( pdf ) if @xmath139@xcite , where @xmath34 is absorbed into @xmath116.this pdf enables the p - representation of @xmath140 hence @xmath136 is separable when @xmath141 .",
    "the p - representation of @xmath15 is a positive integral of the p - representation of @xmath136 . thus @xmath15 is separable . from physical consideration",
    ", we may think @xmath15 is the phase damping of @xmath136 , thus when @xmath136 is separable , @xmath15 should be separable .",
    "the problem left is that when @xmath142 and @xmath143 , the state is separable or not .",
    "we have strong evidence to elucidate that the state is not separable , although we do not give a full proof .",
    "the evidence is like this : the state can not be expressed in p - representation for @xmath142 , @xmath144 @xmath145 is only possible for @xmath141 @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a pdf and @xmath148 denotes two - mode coherent state .",

    "the positivity of @xmath156 is warranted by the fact that when @xmath157 , the state is separable , @xmath156 is a pdf .",
    "if we fix @xmath158 while decreasing @xmath159 to reach a state with @xmath142 , the sign of @xmath156 will not change by decreasing @xmath159 .",
