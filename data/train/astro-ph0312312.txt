    "first - year data from wmap @xcite confirm the low cmb quadrupole and octopole observed earlier by cobe @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for the striking lack of large - scale power is that the universe might not be big enough to support long - wavelength fluctuations @xcite .",
    "that is , the universe may have constant curvature but with a nontrivial global topology and a finite volume . over the past decade",
    "many researchers have investigated this hypothesis , initially in the context of flat space and a vanishing cosmological constant @xcite but later in the more general case ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a myth has arisen that non - trivial topology invariably suppresses the quadrupole and other low - order modes . in the present article",
    "we show this myth to be false . while some non - trivial topologies do indeed suppress the quadrupole , others do not .",
    "in fact some non - trivial topologies elevate the quadrupole . as a general principle , among spaces whose dimensions are roughly comparable to the horizon radius @xmath5",
    ", we find that _ well - proportioned _ spaces suppress the quadrupole ( a well - proportioned space being one whose three dimensions are of similar magnitudes ) while _ oddly - proportioned _ spaces ( with one dimension much larger or smaller than the others ) elevate the quadrupole .",
    "we illustrate this principle in the case of flat 3-tori ( where roughly cubical tori suppress the quadrupole while highly oblate or prolate tori elevate it ) and the case of spherical manifolds ( where the binary polyhedral spaces suppress the quadrupole while typical lens spaces elevate it ) .",
    "first the fallacy . start with a simply connected space @xmath6 (",
    "typically @xmath6 is the 3-sphere @xmath7 , euclidean space @xmath8 or hyperbolic 3-space @xmath9 ) . construct a closed manifold @xmath10 by taking the quotient of @xmath6 under the action of a group @xmath11 .",
    "for sake of discussion assume the quotient space @xmath12 is fairly small , say smaller than the last scattering surface . because @xmath12 is small , the low - order ( long - wavelength ) eigenmodes of the laplacian are suppressed .",
    "so , according to the myth , the cmb quadrupole ( and perhaps also the octopole and other low-@xmath3 cmb multipoles ) are suppressed .",
    "now the fact .",
    "the low - order modes of the laplacian are indeed suppressed . where the myth goes wrong is in neglecting the fact that high - order modes are also suppressed . according to the weyl asymptotic formula @xcite , for sufficiently large wave numbers @xmath13 ,",
    "the number of modes up through @xmath13 is roughly proportional to the volume of @xmath12",
    ". the smaller the manifold @xmath12 , the fewer modes it supports .",
    "the question then becomes , are the low - order modes suppressed more or less severely than the high - order modes ? if the low - order modes are suppressed more severely than the high - order ones , the cmb quadrupole will be suppressed relative to the rest of the power spectrum . if the low - order modes are suppressed less severely , the cmb quadrupole will be elevated relative to the rest of the power spectrum .",
    "sections 3 and 4 will show that well - proportioned spaces suppress the low - order modes more severely while oddly - proportioned spaces suppress them less severely .",
    "the reader might still feel uneasy .",
    "after all , if passing from @xmath6 to the quotient space @xmath12 only removes modes  never adds them  how can the quadrupole possibly get elevated ?",
    "the answer is that the _ relative _ strength of the modes , not their absolute strength , determines the shape of the power spectrum . as an analogy , imagine reducing all prices in the world by a factor of ten while simultaneously reducing all wages , all savings and all debts by the same factor of ten .",
    "obviously nothing has changed and life proceeds as before .",
    "but if in that same scenario your own salary is merely halved , then you are five times wealthier than before in spite of your reduced paycheck .",
    "the same situation occurs with oddly - proportioned spaces : the low - order modes get suppressed but the high - order modes get suppressed even more , so in a relative sense the low - order modes come out stronger .",
    "consider a 3-torus made from a rectangular box of width @xmath14 , length @xmath15 and height @xmath16 . an orthonormal basis for its space of eigenmodes takes the form of planar waves @xmath17 for wave vectors @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are integers ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for full details ) .      first consider a cubic 3-torus of size @xmath14 = @xmath15 = @xmath16 = @xmath22 .",
    "the allowable wave vectors ( [ rectangulartorusbasis ] ) form a cubic lattice in the dual space ( fig .",
    "[ figurelattice ] left ) .",
    "the modulus @xmath23 of a wavevector @xmath24 is inversely proportional to the wavelength . for the cubic 3-torus the shortest wavevectors ,",
    "corresponding to the longest wavelength , are the six vectors @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , each of modulus @xmath28 . for larger moduli @xmath13 ,",
    "corresponding to shorter wavelengths , the number of modes of modulus @xmath29 is simply the number of lattice points within a ball of radius @xmath30 , which grows in rough proportion to the ball s volume @xmath31 .",
    "this cubic 3-torus will serve as the standard to which other 3-tori will be compared in sections  [ subsectiontorussmall ] through [ subsectiontorusgeneral ] .",
    "we assume this _ reference 3-torus _ has a fixed size @xmath22 slightly larger than the diameter of the last scattering surface .",
    "the following sections investigate how shrinking its dimensions suppresses its modes .",
    "section  [ subsectiontorussmall ] shrinks all dimensions equally .",
    "section  [ subsectiontorusoblate ] shrinks one dimension while leave the remaining two fixed .",
    "section  [ subsectiontorusprolate ] shrinks two dimensions while leave one fixed .",
    "finally , section  [ subsectiontorusgeneral ] considers the general case of shrinking all dimensions , but by different amounts .",
    "start with the reference 3-torus of size @xmath22 ( sec .  [ subsectiontoruscubic ] ) and shrink all its dimensions @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 simultaneously from their original length @xmath22 to some new length @xmath32 . as the 3-torus shrinks , the modulus of the lowest modes increases from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "indeed all modes moduli increase by the same factor @xmath35 , so the _ relative _ shape of the mode spectrum remains unchanged , even though that spectrum now occurs for shorter wavelengths ( larger @xmath13 ) .",
    "if the original size @xmath22 and the final size @xmath36 were both significantly greater than the diameter of the last scattering surface , then we would have no reason to expect any particular effect on the cmb quadrupole .",
    "however , in the cosmologically interesting case that @xmath22 is slightly larger than the last scattering surface while @xmath36 is significantly smaller , then even though the former lowest mode at @xmath33 would have contributed strongly to the cmb quadrupole @xmath37 , the new lowest mode at @xmath34 does not , and so the quadrupole is suppressed .",
    "if we were to continue shrinking the 3-torus , we would eventually lose support for the octopole @xmath38 , then @xmath39 and so on .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that for the cosmologically interesting case that @xmath36 is comparable to half the diameter of the last scattering surface , the quadrupole remains significant even though it is suppressed relative to the reference 3-torus .",
    "this weak but non - trivial quadrupole will play a role in our analysis of the general case in section  [ subsectiontorusgeneral ] .      to construct an oblate 3-torus ,",
    "shrink the 3-torus s width @xmath14 while leaving its length and height constant at @xmath15 = @xmath16 = @xmath22 . shrinking the 3-torus by a factor of @xmath40 stretches the lattice of allowable wavevectors ( [ rectangulartorusbasis ] ) in the dual space ( fig .",
    "[ figurelattice ] right ) by the inverse ratio @xmath41 .",
    "the lowest modes still have modulus @xmath42 as in the reference 3-torus ( sec .  [ subsectiontoruscubic ] ) , but their multiplicity has dropped from 6 to 4 , because now only the four wavevectors @xmath43 and @xmath27 retain that modulus .",
    "the other two wavevectors that shared that modulus for the cubic 3-torus , namely @xmath44 , have gotten stretched out to @xmath45 for the oblate 3-torus .    for generic modes ( @xmath46 ) , the mode density ( defined as the number of modes per unit volume in @xmath47-space ) drops by a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , the mode density for the oblate 3-torus ( fig .  [ figurelattice ]",
    "right ) is only @xmath40 times that of the cubic reference 3-torus ( fig .",
    "[ figurelattice ] left ) .",
    "visually , the mode density corresponds to the density of the dots in fig .",
    "[ figurelattice ] .",
    "the crucial point here is that unlike the lowest modes , which depend strongly on the discreteness of the lattice , the overall strength of the high - order modes ( @xmath48 ) depends only on the mode density .    comparing the results of the preceding two paragraphs",
    ", we see that the multiplicity of the lowest - order mode @xmath33 has dropped by a constant factor @xmath49 ( independent of @xmath14  ! ) while the overall density of modes has dropped by @xmath40 .",
    "thus the _ relative _ strength of the lowest mode , compared to the overall spectrum , is @xmath50 = @xmath51 . as @xmath14 gets small the ratio @xmath51",
    "gets arbitrarily large , thus elevating the relative importance of the lowest mode .",
    "similar reasoning applies to the other low - order modes .      to construct a prolate 3-torus ,",
    "shrink the 3-torus s width @xmath14 and its length @xmath15 while leaving its height constant at @xmath16 = @xmath22 .",
    "this stretches the lattice of allowable wavevectors ( [ rectangulartorusbasis ] ) in the dual space by a factor of @xmath41 in the @xmath52-direction and a factor of @xmath53 in the @xmath54-direction , for a total expansion of @xmath55 .",
    "the lowest modes still have modulus @xmath42 as in the reference 3-torus ( sec .",
    "[ subsectiontoruscubic ] ) and the oblate 3-torus ( sec .  [ subsectiontorusoblate ] ) , but their multiplicity has dropped to 2 , because now only the two wavevectors @xmath56 retain that modulus .    for generic modes ( @xmath57 ) , the mode density drops by a factor of @xmath58 . in other words , as we pass from the cubic reference 3-torus to the prolate 3-torus , the lattice now stretches in both the @xmath59 and @xmath60 directions in @xmath61-space , and so the mode density ( the `` dot density '' in fig .  [ figurelattice ] ) drops by @xmath62 .",
    "comparing the results of the preceding two paragraphs , we see that the multiplicity of the lowest - order mode @xmath33 has dropped by a constant factor @xmath63 while the overall density of modes has dropped by @xmath58 .",
    "thus the relative strength of the lowest mode , compared to the overall spectrum , is @xmath64 = @xmath65 .",
    "as @xmath14 and @xmath15 get small the ratio @xmath65 gets arbitrarily large , thus elevating the relative importance of the low - order modes .",
    "consider the case of a general rectangular 3-torus of dimensions @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ". for cosmological interest , assume all dimensions are comparable to or smaller than the diameter of the last scattering surface , and in particular less than the size of the reference 3-torus , that is @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath66 .    to understand this general 3-torus ,",
    "imagine passing from the reference 3-torus of size @xmath67 to the general 3-torus of size @xmath68 in two steps : first shrink isotropically from size @xmath67 to size @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , then shrink anisotropically from @xmath69 to @xmath68 .",
    "the first ( isotropic ) shrinking takes the reference 3-torus @xmath71 to a small cubic 3-torus @xmath69 .",
    "such shrinking suppresses the quadrupole , but if the shrinking is nt too severe  say @xmath72 remains comparable to half the horizon radius  the quadrupole remains significant ( section  [ subsectiontorussmall ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath72 fixes the modulus @xmath73 of the torus s lowest modes , which in turn fix the value @xmath74 at which the cmb power spectrum effectively begins .",
    "the second ( anisotropic ) shrinking takes the small cubic 3-torus @xmath75 , @xmath72 , @xmath76 to the general 3-torus @xmath68 .",
    "the torus s largest dimension remains fixed at @xmath72 , so the lowest mode s modulus remains at @xmath77 , as defined in the previous paragraph , while its multiplicity drops by at most a factor of three ( section  [ subsectiontorusprolate ] ) .",
    "as the 3-torus s remaining dimensions shrink , the high @xmath13 ( short wavelength ) part of the mode spectrum is suppressed in proportion to the 3-torus s volume ( sections  [ subsectiontorusoblate ] and [ subsectiontorusprolate ] ) .",
    "thus whenever this anisotropic shrinking decreases the 3-torus s volume by more than a factor of three , we can expect the _ relative _ strength of the lowest modes to increase relative to the high modes .",
    "note , though , that the cmb power spectrum still effectively begins at the same @xmath74 as before .    in summary , the first ( isotropic )",
    "shrinking pushes the entire mode spectrum uniformly towards shorter wavelengths , moving the lowest modes towards higher @xmath13 .",
    "the second ( anisotropic ) shrinking then holds the ( new ) lowest modes fixed ( with at most a factor of three decrease in multiplicity ) while it further suppresses all short wavelength modes , in proportion to the volume of the 3-torus .",
    "if the first ( isotropic ) shrinking is mild while the second ( anisotropic ) shrinking is severe ( volume changes by more than a factor of three ) , then the latter effect trumps the former , and the lowest cmb multipoles ( @xmath78 ) are elevated relative to their higher-@xmath3 neighbors in the sachs - wolfe plateau .",
    "+ the preceding geometrical arguments constitute a complete and rigorous proof that the ordinary sachs - wolfe component of the cmb behaves as claimed .",
    "nevertheless , readers may be interested to know that careful cmb simulations , taking into account the integrated sachs - wolfe and doppler components as well as the ordinary sachs - wolfe component , confirm these conclusions @xcite .",
    "the 3-sphere @xmath7 supports a discrete set of modes with eigenvalues @xmath79 and multiplicities @xmath80 indexed by a nonnegative integer @xmath13 . in terms of standard @xmath81 coordinates on @xmath82 , the modes are exactly the homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree @xmath13 in the variables @xmath52 , @xmath54 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "taking the quotient of @xmath7 by a finite fixed point free group @xmath11 of isometries yields a spherical manifold @xmath85 of volume @xmath86 .",
    "each mode of @xmath12 lifts to a @xmath11-periodic mode of @xmath7 , and conversely each @xmath11-periodic mode of @xmath7 defines a mode of @xmath12 . in practice one",
    "works with the @xmath11-periodic modes of @xmath7 .",
    "the weyl asymptotic formula asserts that the quotient manifold @xmath12 has , on average , @xmath87 times as many modes as @xmath7 .",
    "the question then is how do the low - order modes of @xmath12 compare to those of @xmath7 ?",
    "does @xmath12 suppress the low - order modes more or less than the overall suppression factor of @xmath87 ?",
    "the following subsections show that the answer depends on whether the manifold is well - proportioned or oddly - proportioned .",
    "the lens space @xmath88 is the quotient of @xmath7 under the action of a cyclic group @xmath11 . roughly speaking",
    ", the quotient acts in a single direction leaving the orthogonal directions `` un - quotiented '' . in this sense",
    "a lens space is analogous to the oblate 3-torus of sec .",
    "[ subsectiontorusoblate ] .",
    "indeed , just as decreasing a single dimension @xmath14 does not change the oblate 3-torus s lowest mode , increasing the order @xmath89 of the lens space ( thus decreasing the volume of the manifold ) does not change the lens space s lowest mode .",
    "the 3-sphere supports a @xmath90 mode of multiplicity four , spanned by the four linear harmonic polynomials @xmath91 .",
    "however , no linear polynomial is invariant under any fixed point free isometry of the 3-sphere ( proof : a linear polynomial achieves a unique maximum on @xmath7 which would need to be preserved , contradicting the fixed point free assumption ) , so no nontrivial spherical 3-manifold @xmath92 admits a @xmath90 mode .",
    "the first potentially nontrivial mode is @xmath93 .",
    "the 3-sphere supports a @xmath93 mode of multiplicity nine . within that 9-dimensional space of modes ,",
    "consider the mode given by the quadratic harmonic polynomial @xmath94 geometrically @xmath95 maintains a maximum along the circle @xmath96 and a minimum along the complementary circle @xmath97 .",
    "after a suitable change of coordinates , the generating matrix for the holonomy of an arbitrary lens space @xmath88 may be written as @xmath98 corresponding geometrically to simultaneous rotation in the @xmath99- and @xmath100-planes .",
    "such a rotation preserves @xmath95 , so @xmath95 defines a @xmath93 mode of _ every _ lens space @xmath88 , proving that every lens space , no matter how small its volume , has a @xmath101 mode of multiplicity at least 1 . for nonhomogeneous lens spaces ( those for which @xmath102 ) there are no other invariant modes and",
    "the multiplicity is exactly 1 .    for homogeneous lens spaces",
    "@xmath103 the generating matrix ( [ lensspacegeneratornonhomogeneous ] ) takes a special form with @xmath104 and two other modes of @xmath7 become invariant , namely @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "( these modes achieve their extrema along clifford parallels , which is why they are invariant under clifford translations . )",
    "thus for a homogeneous lens space the @xmath93 mode has multiplicity 3 .",
    "we have seen that for any lens space , homogeneous or not , the @xmath101 mode always has multiplicity at least 1 , even though the overall mode density is suppressed in proportion to @xmath107 .",
    "thus as @xmath89 gets large the relative importance of the @xmath93 mode increases . for plausible choices of @xmath108",
    "the last scattering surface has moderate size ( for example when @xmath109 , then @xmath110 ) and the lens space s relatively strong @xmath93 mode imprints an elevated quadrupole on the cmb power spectrum .",
    "careful cmb simulations , taking into account the integrated sachs - wolfe and doppler components as well as the ordinary sachs - wolfe component , confirm this expectation @xcite .",
    "the simulations suggest that for homogeneous lens spaces @xmath111 the low-@xmath3 modes are elevated in a uniform way , while for nonhomogeneous lens spaces @xmath88 , @xmath112 ( mod @xmath89 ) , the effect on the low-@xmath3 multipoles is more erratic and depends on the position of the observer .      when @xmath11 is the binary tetrahedral group @xmath113 , the quotient manifold @xmath114 has fundamental domain a regular octahedron , 24 of which tile the 3-sphere .    when @xmath11 is the binary octahedral group @xmath115 , the quotient manifold @xmath114 has fundamental domain a truncated cube , 48 of which tile the 3-sphere .    when @xmath11 is the binary icosahedral group @xmath116 , the quotient manifold @xmath114 has fundamental domain a regular dodecahedron , 120 of which tile the 3-sphere .    in all three cases the fundamental domain is well - proportioned and we expect , in analogy with the small cubic 3-torus of sec .",
    "[ subsectiontorussmall ] , that the low - order modes will be suppressed .",
    "this expectation is borne out : the lowest nontrivial modes of @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 occur at @xmath13 = 6 , 8 and 12 , respectively @xcite . in other words , as the volume of the fundamental domain gets smaller , the lowest modes gradually disappear .",
    "one expects increasing suppression of the cmb quadrupole .",
    "a study of @xmath119 @xcite along with work - in - progress on @xmath117 and @xmath118 confirm this expectation .",
    "lens spaces are short in only one direction ( analogous to the oblate 3-torus ) and retain a lowest mode at @xmath93 no matter how large the order @xmath89 .",
    "this effect is most pronounced for the homogeneous lens spaces @xmath111 , where every observer sees his or her own translates aligned along a single geodesic , related by clifford translations . for a homogeneous lens space",
    "the lowest mode at @xmath93 always has multiplicity 3 ( except for @xmath120 where the multiplicity is 9 due to extra symmetry ) , and the expected cmb quadrupole rises steadily with increasing @xmath89 . for a nonhomogeneous lens space @xmath88 , @xmath112 ( mod @xmath89 ) ,",
    "the multiplicity of the @xmath93 mode is only 1 ; again the cmb quadrupole is elevated but the expected effect on other low-@xmath3 modes is more erratic and depends on the observer s position in the space .    the binary polyhedral spaces @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are homogeneous and every observer may picture him or herself as sitting at the centre of a well - proportioned fundamental domain ( an octahedron , truncated cube or dodecahedron , respectively ) . because the fundamental domain is well - proportioned the lowest modes ( @xmath121 , 8 or 12 , respectively ) disappear entirely . for realistic values of the cosmological parameters ( @xmath109 ) the poincar dodecahedral space @xmath119 suppresses the expected quadrupole most effectively .",
    "to achieve comparable suppression in @xmath117 or @xmath118 requires a slightly higher @xmath108 .",
    "the cmb quadrupole in a finite universe gets suppressed or elevated according to whether the universe s low - order modes are weak or strong relative to its generic high - order modes . in the cosmologically interesting case of a fundamental domain",
    "whose largest dimension is comparable to the diameter of the last scattering surface , we found that in a well - proportioned universe the low order modes will be relatively weak , while in an oddly - proportioned universe they will be relatively strong .",
    "therefore well - proportioned spaces make the best candidates in the ongoing search for a topological explanation of the low cmb quadrupole and octopole .",
