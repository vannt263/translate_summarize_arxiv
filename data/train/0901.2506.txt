    "a ternary algebra or triple system is a vector space @xmath1 endowed with a ternary law of composition @xmath2 which is a linear mapping with respect to each its argument , and we will call this mapping a ternary multiplication or triple product of a ternary algebra @xmath1 .",
    "hence a ternary algebra is an algebra which closes under a suitable triple product .",
    "obviously any binary algebra which closes under double product can be considered as a ternary algebra if one defines the ternary multiplication as twice successively applied binary one , and in this case the ternary multiplication is generated by a binary one .",
    "however there are ternary multiplications which can not be obtained as twice successively applied binary multiplication .",
    "for instance , pure imaginary numbers or elements of grading one of a superalgebra closes under triple product .",
    "a well known example of a ternary matrix algebra is the vector space @xmath3 of @xmath4 matrices endowed with the ternary multiplication @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is transpose of the matrix @xmath8 . since lie algebras play a fundamental role in physics , particular attention",
    "was given to ternary algebras when they were shown to be building blocks of ordinary lie algebras .",
    "given ternary algebra one can construct a lie algebra by using the method proposed by kantor in @xcite .",
    "this method was extended to super lie algebras in @xcite and later was applied by the same authors in @xcite to construct a gauge field theory by introducing fundamental fields associated with the elements of a ternary algebra .",
    "a skew - symmetric bilinear form is an important component in the large class of algebraic structures such as lie algebras , grassmann algebras and clifford algebras .",
    "for example , the lie brackets @xmath9:{\\frak l}\\times{\\frak l}\\to { \\frak l}$ ] of a lie algebra @xmath10 is the skew - symmetric bilinear form , and the multiplication @xmath11 of a grassmann algebra @xmath12 restricted to the subspace of odd elements is the skew - symmetric bilinear form .",
    "a skew - symmetry of a bilinear form can be interpreted by means of the faithful representation of the symmetric group @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the identity permutation , as follows : a bilinear form @xmath15 is skew - symmetric if @xmath16 .",
    "making use of this interpretation we can construct a ternary analog of a skew - symmetric bilinear form replacing @xmath17 by @xmath18 with its faithful representation by cubic roots of unity @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 , where @xmath14 is the identity permutation and @xmath21 are the cyclic permutations , as follows : a trilinear form @xmath22 is called @xmath0-skew - symmetric if for any elements @xmath23 of a vector space @xmath1 it satisfies @xmath24 the notion of a @xmath0-skew - symmetric form can be assumed as a basis for a ternary analog of grassmann , clifford and lie algebras .",
    "these ternary structures were developed in @xcite and applied to construct a ternary analog of supersymmetry algebra in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study algebras with ternary law of composition . in section 2",
    "we consider partially and totally associative ternary algebras of first and second kind . we show that a triple product of a ternary algebra induces three binary multiplications and find the sufficient and necessary condition a triple product of a ternary algebra must satisfy in order to induce the associative binary algebra . assuming the vector space underlying a ternary algebra to be a topological space and a triple product to be continuous mapping we consider the trivial vector bundle over a ternary algebra and",
    "show that a triple product induces a structure of binary algebra in each fiber of this vector bundle .",
    "the sufficient and necessary condition a ternary multiplication must satisfy in order to induce a structure of associative binary algebra in each fiber is given in terms of the vector bundle over a ternary algebra .",
    "the relations for different kinds of partial and total associativity of a ternary algebra and induced by it binary algebras are found in the terms of the structure constants of a ternary algebra .",
    "it should be pointed out that the cohomologies of a ternary algebra of associative type are studied in @xcite .    in section 3",
    "we consider an algebraic structure consisting of two bimodules over unital associative algebras with involution and construct a ternary algebra by means of this algebraic structure .",
    "choosing different modules , unital associative algebras and homomorphisms we show that this structure allows to construct a large class of ternary algebras including a ternary algebra of rectangular matrices and ternary algebras of sections of a vector bundle over a smooth finite dimensional manifold .",
    "we end the section 3 by constructing the binary lie algebra of matrices whose entries are the elements of bimodules and unital associative algebras .",
    "it should be mentioned that there are @xmath25-ary generalizations of lie algebra which include the concepts such as @xmath25-ary algebra of lie type enclosing @xmath25-ary nambu algebra , @xmath25-ary nambu - lie algebra .",
    "the concept of @xmath25-ary hom - algebra structure generalizing previously mentioned @xmath25-ary generalizations of lie algebra is introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "a good and detailed survey on the theory of ternary algebras can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a large class of associative algebras can be constructed by means of square matrices and their multiplication .",
    "though the rectangular matrices can be successfully used to construct a ternary algebra we think that probably more appropriate objects to construct ternary algebras are the cubic matrices .",
    "our aim in section 4 is to construct ternary algebras of cubic matrices and to study their structures .",
    "we find four different totally associative ternary multiplications of second kind of cubic matrices and prove that these are the only totally associative ternary multiplications of second kind in the case of cubic matrices .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our search for associative ternary multiplications of cubic matrices has shown that there is no totally associative ternary multiplication of first kind in the case of cubic matrices .",
    "i section 5 we describe the ternary analog of lie algebra of cubic matrices of second order by finding all commutation relations of generators of this algebra with respect to @xmath0-commutator .",
    "in this section we remind a notion of a ternary algebra and its partial or total associativity of first or second kind . holding fixed one argument of a ternary multiplication",
    "we get the binary multiplications and study the relation between the associativity of a ternary multiplication and the associativity of induced binary multiplication .",
    "we propose to use a vector bundle approach to describe the family of binary algebras induced by a ternary algebra .",
    "let @xmath26 be complex vector spaces , and @xmath27 be a @xmath28-valued trilinear form .",
    "we will call @xmath22 a ternary law of composition or ternary multiplication on @xmath1 if @xmath22 is a @xmath1-valued trilinear form .",
    "the pair @xmath29 is said to be a ternary algebra or triple system if @xmath1 is a complex vector space , and @xmath30 is a ternary law of composition on @xmath1 .",
    "it is obvious that relation analogous to binary associativity in the case of ternary law of composition should contain at least five elements of @xmath1 .",
    "there are three different ways to apply twice a ternary multiplication @xmath22 to ordered sequence of five elements @xmath31 which lead us to the following relations defining a notion of partial associativity for ternary multiplication : @xmath32    hence we have three different kinds of partially associative ternary algebra @xmath33 which will be called -partially associative ternary algebra ( [ lr - kind ] ) , -partially associative ternary algebra of first kind ( [ lc - kind ] ) and -partially associative ternary algebra of first kind ( [ cr - kind ] ) .",
    "a ternary algebra @xmath33 is said to be totally associative ternary algebra of first kind if its ternary multiplication @xmath22 satisfies any two of the relations ( [ lr - kind])([cr - kind ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that in the case of totally associative ternary algebra of first kind a ternary multiplication @xmath22 satisfies the relations @xmath34 where @xmath31 .",
    "the notion of totally associative ternary algebra of first kind can be viewed as a direct ternary generalization of classical associativity @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are the elements of an algebra @xmath37 with a binary law of composition @xmath38 , when one applies twice algebra multiplication ( binary or ternary ) to ordered sequence of elements of algebra successively shifting the first ( interior ) multiplication from left to right and setting equal obtained products . in this sense",
    "the notion of -partial associativity can be considered as most similar to classical associativity whereas the notion of -partial or -partial associativity can be defined for the first time only in the case of ternary multiplication because in the case of binary multiplication there is no central group of two elements in the middle of a sequence @xmath39 .",
    "since the notion of -partial or -partial associativity appears for the first time in the case of ternary multiplication there is no reason to keep the requirement of fixed order of a sequence @xmath31 looking for a possible analogs of associativity in the case of ternary algebras .",
    "it turns out that we get a useful notion of ternary associativity giving up the requirement of fixed order of elements in a sequence @xmath31 .",
    "this means that unlike the case of ternary associativity of first kind we not only successively shift the first ( interior ) multiplication inside a sequence of elements @xmath31 from left to right but at the same time permute the elements @xmath40 in the middle of sequence .",
    "obviously we should use non - cyclic permutation in order to get the initial order of a sequence @xmath41 on the second step .",
    "this reasoning leads us to the following relations : @xmath42 a ternary algebra @xmath29 is said to be -partially associative ternary algebra of second kind if ternary multiplication @xmath22 satisfies ( [ lc - secondkind ] ) and -partially associative ternary algebra of second kind if @xmath22 satisfies ( [ cr - secondkind ] ) .",
    "a ternary algebra @xmath29 is said to be totally associative ternary algebra of second kind if it is -partially associative and either -partially associative of second kind or -partially associative of second kind .",
    "hence in the case of totally associative ternary algebra of second kind we have @xmath43    a ternary multiplication @xmath22 of ternary algebra @xmath33 has three arguments @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , and if we fix one of them then @xmath22 induces the binary multiplication on @xmath46 .",
    "it is obvious that this allows us to split the ternary multiplication @xmath22 into three binary ones .",
    "we can study the structure of ternary multiplication @xmath22 from this point of view by making use of known concepts and methods of the theory of binary algebras . given an element @xmath47 a ternary multiplication @xmath22 induces three binary multiplications @xmath48 on @xmath1 defined as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the binary multiplications @xmath51 are not independent because of the relations @xmath52 a vector space @xmath1 equipped with the binary multiplication @xmath53 becomes the binary algebra which will be denoted by @xmath54 .",
    "considering an element @xmath55 in @xmath54 as a parameter ranging within a vector space @xmath1 we have three families of binary algebras @xmath56 induced by a ternary multiplication @xmath22 .",
    "the family of binary algebras @xmath54 is said to be an associative family of binary algebras induced by a ternary algebra @xmath33 if for any @xmath31 it holds @xmath57 taking @xmath58 in the previous relation we see that each associative family of binary algebras @xmath54 is the family of associative binary algebras .",
    "it is useful to describe the above mentioned families of binary algebras in terms of vector bundle . for this purpose",
    "we will assume that @xmath46 is a topological vector space , and a ternary multiplication @xmath2 is a continuous mapping . let us consider the direct product @xmath59 as the trivial vector bundle over the base space @xmath46 with the fiber @xmath1 and the projection @xmath60 defined as usual @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",

    "let @xmath69 be two points of the base space of a vector bundle @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath70 is the isomorphism between two fibers .    in order to apply the constructed vector bundle @xmath71 to describe the families of binary algebras induced by a ternary algebra @xmath33 within the framework of a single structure we assume that the base space @xmath1 of this bundle is equipped with a ternary multiplication @xmath22 . for any point @xmath47 of the base space a fiber @xmath72 at this point",
    "is endowed with one of the binary multiplications @xmath48 which we carry over from the family of binary algebras to fibers of @xmath71 by requiring @xmath65 to be an isomorphism of algebras , i.e. @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
