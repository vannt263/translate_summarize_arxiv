    "from the observed data ( listed in table 6 ) we can extract several physical parameters of the superbubbles :    \\1 .",
    "the rms electron density of a superbubble is calculated from its h@xmath0 flux and dimensions according to the relation :    @xmath47    this relation was obtained by assuming that the emitting gas is at t = 10@xmath48 k and distributed in an spherical shell of radius r ( in pc ) and thickness , @xmath49r = r/12 .",
    "the other quantities , f(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath50 , are listed in table [ cat_shells ] .",
    "the expansion velocity , v@xmath51 , of a superbubble can be estimated as one half of the difference in velocities of the components listed in table [ cat_shells ] .",
    "the mechanical energy of the superbubble , k.e .",
    "= 0.5 m v@xmath52 , is calculated according with the relation :    @xmath53    in obtaining this relation we have assumed that the mass is concentrated in the spherical shell of radius r ( in pc ) and thickness , @xmath49r = r/12 .",
    "we have also assumed that @xmath54 = 0.65 , as for an ionized hydrogen gas .",
    "the kinematic age of the superbubble can be obtained from the following relation :    @xmath55    this relation has been obtained by noting that the kinematic age of wind blown bubbles can be estimated as : t = 0.5 - 0.6 r / v ( mccray @xcite ) .",
    "table [ parameters_shells ] lists the physical parameters of the catalogued superbubbles calculated as discussed above : the superbubble s number ( according to our catalogue ) , the shell radius ( see sect .",
    "5.3 ) , the rms electron density , the expansion velocity , the mechanical energy and the dynamical age of the superbubble .",
    "meaburn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have obtained expansion velocities for five of these superbubbles .",
    "our results agree with these previous observations except for the dimensions of some of the superbubbles .",
    "the angular dimensions of the superbubbles were determined on the velocity maps at h@xmath0 and they are given in column 3 in table [ cat_shells ] .",
    "the reported dimensions in this table correspond to the extension of the semiaxes in arc sec . in the cases where we have two different values , i.e. , when the shell is not circular , we average them .",
    "the resulting linear radii are listed in column 2 in table [ parameters_shells ] .    comparing the size distribution of the regions and complexes of",
    "( see section 4.2 ) against the superbubble size distribution we note the following differences : while the diameters of the regions range from 27 to 254 pc ( this later value corresponds to large complexes not ring - shaped ) , those of the superbubbles range from 110 to 304 pc ( note that there is an overlap between these two populations ) . thus , the superbubbles have , in general , larger dimensions than those of regions , pointing towards a more evolved nebular population .",
    "figure [ histogram ] shows the size distribution , @xmath56 , of the superbubbles in .",
    "it is worth comparing this size distribution with the size distributions of other galaxies . in order to do so",
    ", we have examined the size distributions of the galaxies smc , holmberg ii , m31 and m33 reported in oey & clarke ( @xcite ; see their figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "it is important to take into account the small number statistics of the superbubbles in the studied field of ( only 17 ) .",
    "furthermore , our superbubbles are ionized regions while the superbubbles in oey & clarke ( @xcite ) correspond to holes .",
    "nevertheless , we see that the distributions show some similarity .",
    "the peak of maximum frequency of the superbubbles in these galaxies corresponds to @xmath57 pc ( smc ) , 120 pc ( m33 ) , 180 pc ( m31 ) and 500 pc ( hol ii ) ; this peak , in the case of , is at @xmath58 pc , thus , similar to the one of m 33 holes . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a difference in the maximum linear extent of the superbubbles : the superbubbles in reach @xmath59 pc while the superbubbles in the other studied galaxies reach diameters of 720 pc ( m31 ) , 760 pc ( smc ) , 1160 pc ( m33 ) and 1400 pc ( hol ii ) ; note that the latter two values fall into the category of supershells according to the typical terminology .",
    "this difference could be due to the fact that we are only detecting ionized shells while the other studies are based on holes .",
    "we have also obtained the cumulative diameter distribution @xmath60 for the superbubbles . in figure [ distribution_bubbles ]",
    "we plot @xmath61 . for the superbubbles of a least squares",
    "fit gives @xmath62 pc .",
    "this value is in agreement with the value ( @xmath32=83 pc ) determined by price et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who included some superbubbles in their calculation of the diameter distribution .",
    "we have seen in the preceding sections ( more precisely in section 5.1 ) that every superbubble detected in this work corresponds to one ( or several ) stellar association(s ) interior to the superbubble .",
    "this suggests that the superbubbles are formed by the combined action of stellar winds and supernova explosions of the massive stars of the associations . in what follows",
    ", we will examine in more detail this possibility and the models used to describe this formation and evolution .",
    "the shell formation and evolution as a result of the interaction of strong winds of a massive star with its ambient medium has been studied a long time ago by several authors ( dyson & de vries @xcite ; castor et al .",
    "@xcite ; steigman , strittmatter & williams @xcite ; weaver et al .",
    "@xcite , amongst others ) . the more favored ( and complete ) description of this interaction is the `` standard model '' ( weaver et al .",
    "@xcite ) which considers that a star at rest releases a _ constant _ wind power , l@xmath63 , that interacts with the ambient medium ( assumed to be homogeneous ) . as a result of this interaction , two shocks",
    "are formed ( one in the stellar wind and another in the ambient medium ) .",
    "the shell formation is the result of these shocks and the shell expansion is driven by the thermal pressure of the shocked stellar wind .",
    "the shocked stellar wind has no significant radiative cooling and for this reason this model is also called _ adiabatic _ or _",
    "energy conserving_. this model could also be applied to explain the formation of larger shells ( superbubbles and supershells ) formed by the combined action of stellar winds and supernova explosions . in spite of the popularity and theoretical simplicity of the standard model ,",
    "several observational difficulties have prevented its test in real cases .",
    "the main difficulty is the poor knowledge of the interior stars and of their wind power .",
    "observational works ( oey @xcite ) where the stellar content has been thoughtfully analyzed and using numerical ( instead of the analytical ) models that take into account the temporal variations of the wind power as a result of the stellar evolution ( oey @xcite ) , have found discrepancies between the predicted shell radius and expansion velocity in the sense that the expansion velocities are too high for the observed radii ( `` dynamical discrepancy '' ) or between the shell radius and velocity and the wind power , l@xmath63 , and pre - shock density , n@xmath64 , in the sense that l@xmath63/n@xmath64 seems to be overestimated by a factor of 10 ( `` growth rate discrepancy '' ) . having these considerations in mind",
    "we will proceed to analyze our results , summarized in table [ parameters_shells ] .",
    "a close examination of the physical parameters reported in table [ parameters_shells ] shows that :     the rms electron densities of the superbubbles are quite low ( from 0.3 to up to 6.3 @xmath65 ) .",
    "this makes it quite difficult to obtain electron densities from [ ] line - ratio diagnosis because the line - ratios will fall in the low density regime ( n@xmath66 @xmath42 300 @xmath65 ) .    ",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosities of the superbubbles vary from 2.11 @xmath3 10@xmath67 to 5.89 @xmath3 10@xmath68 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "these luminosity values imply a number of ionizing photons s@xmath7 ranging from to 4.33 @xmath3 10@xmath69 .",
    "these ionizing photons can be easily supplied by the interior blue stars .",
    "thus , the superbubbles seem to be ionized by the stars of the interior associations .",
    " the dynamical ages of the superbubbles ( column 6 of table [ parameters_shells ] ) are of the order of 1 - 2 myr and in every case , shorter than the age of the interior stellar association ( column 4 of table [ stars ] ) .",
    "the fact that the dynamical ages are shorter than those of the stellar associations suggests that the stellar associations could form the superbubbles .",
    "furthermore , the fact that there is a delay ( of about 10 myr ) between the formation of the stellar association and the formation of the superbubble ( estimated by its dynamical age ) , suggests that only the most massive stars of the interior association are responsible for superbubble formation when they evolve into supergiants ( or perhaps have exploded as supernovae ) .",
    " the obtained expansion velocities of the superbubbles are in general quite high .",
    "all the known expansion velocities are larger than 25 km s@xmath7 and there are two superbubbles with expansion velocities larger than 40 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this is similar to the case of the superbubbles in the lmc where rosado et al .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) , rosado ( @xcite ) and oey ( @xcite ) have found several superbubbles with high expansion velocities .",
    "the kinematics of this class of superbubbles ( `` high velocity superbubbles '' ) can not be explained in terms of the `` standard model '' of adiabatic wind - blown bubbles ( weaver et al .",
    "@xcite ) because the expansion velocities are too large for the observed shell radius , according to the predictions of this model .    in the case of the superbubbles of",
    ", our stellar photometry can give us some knowledge of the massive stars interior to the catalogued superbubbles but we can not follow the treatment given in oey ( @xcite ) because further spectroscopic work is needed in order to know accurately the content of massive stars . in the absense of this accurate knowledge we can , nevertheless , estimate the required wind power ( l@xmath63 ) of each superbubble and compare it with the number of massive stars that we detect in our photometric observations , in order to see , in terms of energy considerations , whether the standard model could explain the superbubble formation .    assuming that the superbubbles evolve according to the standard model of wind - blown bubbles ( weaver et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the wind power , l@xmath63 , released by the stars _ constantly during all _ of the dynamical age of the shell is given by :    @xmath70    where , n@xmath64 , the ambient pre - shock density , is taken as : by assuming that the swept - up mass in the shell comes from a homogeneous sphere of radius r. both n@xmath66 and r are listed in table [ parameters_shells ] .",
    "a wind power of 4@xmath310@xmath67 ergs s@xmath7 is reasonably expected for one o9.5 or b0 supergiant star ( pauldrach et al .",
    "@xcite ) during its lifetime in this phase ( about 10@xmath71 yr ) .",
    "more massive stars can have larger wind powers but the duration of those phases is ten times shorter .",
    "that is the case for o4i stars that can release more than 100 times the wind power of 1@xmath310@xmath67 ergs s@xmath7 , or of wr stars that can release about 50@xmath310@xmath67 ergs s@xmath7 ; however , these events occur only during time scales shorter than the dynamical ages of the superbubbles considered here ( a few 10@xmath72 yr compared with the dynamical ages of about 1 myr derived in this work ) .    in table",
    "[ wind_power ] we list the required wind power l@xmath63 that can explain the observed expansion velocities and radii of the superbubbles studied here , in terms of the standard model , and the number of detected blue stars ( with m@xmath73 @xmath42 2 , or m@xmath74 @xmath75 7 m@xmath45 ) , n@xmath76 , quoted in column 3 of table [ stars_shell ] .",
    "we see that superbubbles with expansion velocities lower than 30 km s@xmath7 have wind powers that are easily explained by the number of blue stars inside them ( assuming that they are all supergiants and earlier than b0 ) . on the contrary , there are some extreme cases , such as r2 , where the required wind power seems to imply that some of the interior blue stars should release much more powerful winds . given our limitations in the accurate knowledge of the stellar content of the superbubbles , we can only state that , from energy considerations , the superbubbles studied here could be formed by the stellar winds of the interior stars .",
    "it is interesting to note from table [ cat_shells ] that the superbubbles of with higher velocities seem to be brighter in [ ] emission . on the other hand , an inspection of table [ parameters_shells ]",
    "shows that all the superbubbles have mechanical energies of at most 80 @xmath77 the energy of one supernova explosion ( approximately 13@xmath310@xmath78 ergs ) .",
    "taking into account that between 20 to 30 @xmath77 of this energy is transmitted to the ambient medium as kinetic energy , one or two sn explosions could also account for the formation ( or acceleration ) of the superbubbles .",
    "however , no traces of these sn explosions ( such as extended x - rays sources or non - thermal radio emission ) have been found .",
    "figure [ vr ] shows the global radial velocity field ( not corrected for projection effects ) of the central region of obtained from our fp data in h@xmath0 , considering diffuse gas , regions and superbubbles . in this map",
    "a chaotic distribution of velocities across the galaxy can be seen : some local events are superimposed onto the regular field .",
    "these local events are the peculiar kinematical signatures of the superbubbles , which are notorious . however , when the expansions are extracted , we see a variation in the mean velocities across the field . along the ne region ,",
    "a gradient of velocities ranges from 210 km s@xmath7 in the southeast to 250 km s@xmath7 in the northwest .",
    "the extreme detected velocities are due to the contamination of the superbubble and snr internal motions .",
    "indeed , the region n27 ( with the maximum velocity of @xmath79139 km s@xmath7 ) is the superbubble r2 and n18 ( with the minimum velocity of @xmath79328 km s@xmath7 ) is the snr sandage 8",
    ". it would be important to have kinematic data of the ionized gas over the whole dimensions of this galaxy in order to obtain its rotation curve .",

    "their velocity resolution is 6.18 km s@xmath7 and the linear resolution is approximately 210 pc . in this figure",
    "we can see that in general , the optical distribution does not correspond to any particular kinematical feature .",
    "however , with respect to the density distribution ( not shown ) , it has been noted that the optical extent of is located at the peak of the density distribution and at the ridge of an hole ( lake & skillman @xcite ) . in order to compare the kinematics of the ionized gas with the kinematics we also require more observations covering the whole optical extent of this galaxy .",
    "we have measured  by means of a fabry - perot interferometer  the kinematical parameters of the regions that we have detected within the 10@xmath5 field of view of our observations ( which includes most of the optical emission of ) .",
    "we found that the regions of present similar integrated properties as well as h@xmath0 line profiles with simple structure that are fitted by single gaussian curves .",
    "we obtained also the h@xmath0 fluxes and luminosities of these regions .",

    "we have also studied the diameter distribution and the cumulative diameter distribution of the regions within our field of view .",
    "we obtained a characteristic diameter @xmath33 pc which is slightly larger than the previous determination by hlg , probably because our field is smaller .",

    "furthermore , we find that the dynamical time scales of the superbubbles are always shorter than the ages of the interior stellar associations . the mean temporal delay between those ages ( about 10 myr ) suggests that only evolved members ( i.e. , the more massive stars ) of these associations are responsible for the formation of the superbubbles , possibly when they evolve to supergiants or when they explode as supernovae .",
