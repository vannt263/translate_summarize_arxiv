    "subsequent work has verified these estimates .",
    "for example , silverstone et al . (",
    "2006 ) found no examples of inner dust disks in systems that lack signatures of on  going gas accretion from the disk onto the star ( cf .",
    "cieza et al .",
    "however with surveys of star - forming regions enabled by the spitzer space telescope , dozens of these rare objects can now be identified ( e.g. merin et al . 2008 ) .",
    "much attention is focused on understanding the nature of transition disks ( najita et al . 2007",
    "; alexander & armitage 2007 ) .",
    "some appear to have inner cleared regions due to the presence of previously unseen faint companions at small orbital radii ( ireland & kraus , 2008 ) .",
    "work continues to understand the detailed distribution of gas and dust in these systems ( e.g. espaillat et al .",
    "one troubling feature in all of these disk studies is the general _ lack _ of correlation between key physical variables and observational properties of the disks ( watson et al .",
    "for example , pascucci et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found no difference in dust properties between binary and single stars .",
    "some disks can be quite long lived ( more than 10 myr old ) and still appear very similar to typically much younger classical t tauri stars ( e.g. pds 66 ; cortes et al .",
    "often morphological ordering of disk spectra or other properties can be quite compelling ( e.g. bouwman et al .",
    "2008 ) . but more often than not",
    ", ranking by estimates of stellar age appear to disturb the apparent evolutionary sequences .",
    "although errors in determining stellar ages are a likely culprit , it does seem that there are  hidden variables  contributing significantly to primordial disk evolution .    as a complement to studies of the dust ,",
    "can we probe further the evolution of the gas from which giant planets might form ( najita et al .",
    "2007 ) ? for young stars in the taurus dark cloud , there is an excellent correspondence between spectroscopic signatures of gas accretion from the inner disk onto the surface of the star and the presence of near  ir excess emission ( hartigan , edwards , and ghandour , 1995 ) .",
    "indeed the evolution of accretion rates appears to mimic to some extent the evolution of hot dust ( hartmann et al . 1998 ; gatti et al . 2008 ) .",
    "spitzer spectra are starting to reveal interesting chemistry in the disks young young stars ( carr & najita , 2008 ; pascucci et al .",
    "high resolution near  infrared spectroscopy combined with high spatial resolution can reveal interesting offsets between the emitting regions of various molecules ( pontoppidan et al . 2008 ) .",
    "millimeter wave observations are required to trace rotational transitions of cool gas at large radii ( e.g. dutrey et al . 2007 ) .    yet",
    "the bulk of the mass in these disks is in molecular hydrogen , which is difficult to detect .",
    "some efforts have been made to trace molecular hydrogen directly by observing the pure rotational lines in the mid  infrared from the ground at high spectral resolution ( bitner et al .",
    "the spitzer space telescope also provided a platform to search for gas using the irs in high resolution mode .",
    "based on equilibrium chemical models of gorti & hollenbach , 2004 ) , pascucci et al .",
    "( 2006 ) report non  detections from the feps survey ( meyer et al .",
    "2006 ) for stars with ages between 3100 myr that lack signatures of accretion , but possess optically  thin dust emission .",
    "the upper limits place constraints of @xmath1 10 myr on the timescale to form gas giants in these systems .",
    "these timescales are of interest for comparison to models of gas giant planet formation through classical core accretion ( e.g. lissauer & stevenson 2007 ) as well as gravitational fragmentation which proceeds more quickly ( durisen et al .",
    "future observations with herschel and sofia will be powerful probes of even small amounts of residual emission perhaps placing constraints on the formation of super - earths and ice giants .",
    "we note for completeness that circumstellar gas has been detected for some debris disks ( e.g. dent et al .",
    "2005 ) , which are the subject of the next section .",
    "how does remnant disk material evolve when the bulk of the gas capable of forming giant planets has dissipated ? in the classical theory , protoplanets initially grow in an orderly way through collisions of comparable sized bodies .",
    "as gravitational focusing becomes important , the larger bodies grow fastest in a runaway mode until a modest number of  successes  reach the local isolation mass , essentially consuming all material within several times their gravitational sphere of influence ( hill radius ) .",
    "these oligarchs then perturb each other over time resulting in handfuls of collisions that create a small number of planets ( e.g. nagasawa et al .",
    "2007 ) . at 1",
    "au around the sun , we imagine the earth as built through the collision of several mars - sized objects .",
    "it is thought that similar processes operate ( in the presence of gas ) to form the cores of giant planets . in the first phase",
    ", we can estimate the frequency of collisions by knowing the surface density of solids ( @xmath6 ) as well as the orbital timescale ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 where r and @xmath9 are the radius and volume density of the object built through these collisions in time @xmath10 .",
    "if we combine estimates of the dependence of disk mass on star mass ( @xmath11 ) and orbital radius ( @xmath12 ) with the orbital frequency we get @xmath13 for a constant @xmath9 .",
    "this implies , within a fixed time interval , disks around stars of higher mass form : a ) more massive planets at a given orbital distance ; and b ) planets of a given mass at larger orbital separation . both are consistent with recent radial velocity results ( johnson et al .",
    "yet it appears that primordial disks evolve more quickly around stars of higher mass ( carpenter et al .",
    "2006 ) , complicating the implications of this simple picture for planet formation around stars as a function of their mass .",
    "observations of debris disks have become powerful tools to study the evolution of planetary systems and their value has increased as we have learned more about the asteroid and kuiper belts in our own solar system ( wyatt 2008 ) . as cooler dust orbiting at larger radii emits at longer wavelengths , we can use the wavelength dependence of excess emission as a proxy for its location in the absence of resolved images . with the spitzer space telescope , we can detect @xmath14 earth masses of dust if it is found in micron  sized particles from photometric surveys at 24 @xmath4 m , efficiently tracing material with temperatures above 100 k ( often tracing radii @xmath110 au around sun  like stars ) .",
    "meyer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) report the results from feps for 24 @xmath4 m excess emission around an unbiased parent sample of 309 stars .",
    "they find that 1020 % of sun  like stars show evidence for 24 @xmath4 m excess over an age range from 3300 myr with a significant drop in the frequency of 24 @xmath4 m excess for older stars .",
    "as we can only observe the product of the frequency of this phenomena and its duration , the interpretation of these results is ambiguous .",
    "they also suggest that the frequency of excess _ may _ be higher for stars in open clusters compared to field stars of comparable age though the evidence for this is not significant .",
    "note that the ages of the open cluster stars are the  gold standard  for stellar ages in these studies and thus it is difficult to compare results between them and field stars .",
    "in contrast , greaves et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find a surprising lack of emission at 1.3 mm towards sun  like stars in the pleiades open cluster despite significant improvement in sensitivity compared to previous observations .",
    "the above mentioned spitzer results are consistent with other surveys for 24 @xmath4 m excess around fgk stars as a function of time ( e.g. siegler et al .",
    "it is worth remembering that these survey limits are only able to detect dust producing planetesimal belts that are about @xmath15 brighter than our own inner zodiacal dust generated from collisions in the asteroid belt .",
    "wyatt et al . (",
    "2007 ) compare these observations to models of collisional evolution for planetesimal belts finding that some warm debris excesses ( e.g. hd 69830 ) are so large that they can not be the result of pure collisional evolution and must be transient . although the models of kenyon & bromley ( 2004 ) explain the observed behavior in a qualitative way , updates to the input physics continue to improve the agreement between the models and data ( bromley & kenyon 2008 ) .",
    "models for several debris disks detected with spitzer require extended distributions of dust ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "2008 ) consistent with resolved images of some sources ( corder et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "what ( if any ) correlation should we expect between the presence of dust debris and the frequency of gas giant planets detected through radial velocity variations ?",
    "one might speculate that a disk rich in heavy elements capable of forming gas giant planets ( e.g. fischer & valenti 2005 ; santos et al .",
    "2004 ) might initially have a high surface density of solids and thus produce a lot of dust early  on , outshining a system that lacked enough dust to form giant planets .",
    "if however , such a system produces several planets unstable to mutual perturbations , dynamical rearrangement could deplete dust - producing planetesimals in the inner and outer regions as suggested by the nice model for the early evolution of our solar system ( e.g. tsiganis et al . 2005 ) .",
    "such a system could then become a very weak dust producer at late times ( figure 2 ) .",
    "it is in part these complexities that prevent us from making comparisons of spitzer observations to what is known about our solar system .",
    "moro  martin et al .",
    "( 2007a ) search for a correlation between the presence or absence of excess with gas giant planets and was unable to confirm any ( though the sample size was modest ) .",
    "apai et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also searched ( without success ) for the presence of gas giant planets around stars for which large inner holes in the dust debris had been inferred .",
    "there are , however , remarkable examples of systems with evidence for planets that also maintain debris which deserve special study ( moro  martin et al . 2007b ; lovis et al .",
    "2006 ) including the recently announced direct imaging results for fomalhaut ( kalas et al . 2008 ) and hr 8799 ( marois et al .",
    "2008 ) . we can also ask whether debris is correlated with the heavy element abundance of the star as it is famously with the probability of having a gas giant planet .",
    "greaves , fischer , & wyatt ( 2006 ) find that the metallicity distribution of stars with cold debris detected in the sub ",
    "millimeter is consistent with having been drawn from the same distribution as the parent sample of stars .",

    ", in preparation ) .",

    "bryden et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimate that spitzer only detects the tip of the iceberg in terms of dust debris , and survey results to date are _ consistent _ with our solar system ir emission being near the mean for sun  like stars in the milky way .    given the mixed results for the correlation of debris with planets",
    ", can we expect more order in the behavior of debris with stellar multiplicity ?",
    "there is considerable literature on the similarities and differences in disk evolution between single and binary t tauri stars ( monin et al . 2007 ) . with regard to debris around one or both components of a binary system , trilling et al .",
    "( 2007 ) report spitzer results finding a complex mix of behaviors including circumbinary debris disks , circumstellar disks in wide binary systems , as well as the apparition of dust at inferred orbital distances consistent with the separation of the binary companion ! at minimum , one can infer that debris dust as detected by spitzer is not inhibited in multiple systems .",

    "debris suspected from the 24 @xmath4 m photometry can be confirmed with confidence .",
    "even more important , the temperature of the hottest dust detected can be estimated from the broadband spectrophotometry providing estimates of the inner radius of the debris disks in the sample .",
    "the detected dust is cooler on average ( and thus located at larger radii ) than assumed in meyer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) : the distribution of inner radii for the ( often extended ) debris disks detected in the survey range from 330 au , with a peak at 10 au .",
    "there is no evidence for evolution of the dust temperature with age , though the magnitude of the observed excess does decline over time ( with considerable dispersion at any one age ) .",
    "it appears that some of the 24 @xmath4 m excess emission observed is the wien tail of bright , but cool , dust at radii beyond the terrestrial planet zone .",
    "emission evolves from bright to faint ( or in some cases hot to cool ) within 300 myr . yet",
    "the picture that emerges overall is one where most debris is cleared out to radii of 10 au on timescales of 310 myr !",
    "whether this represents complete  mission success  for planet formation between 0.110 au or presents a challenge to current theory remains to be explored .",

    "it is extremely tempting to compare these results for fkg stars to those for stars of different temperature & luminosity in order to explore diversity in the formation and evolution of planetary systems as a function of stellar mass .",
    "however , such comparisons require caution .",
    "for example , in a survey where the sensitivity is limited by photometric precision of detecting an excess in contrast to the flux of the star , the amount of detectable dust around a more luminous star is larger than the detectable amount around one of lower luminosity .",
    "also dust at a given temperature is located at a larger radius around a more luminous star .",
    "any comparison should take this into account in terms of solid angle for the emission as well as the expected orbital period and dust surface density distribution .",
    "overall , one can say that the magnitude of the excesses observed at 24 and 70 @xmath4 m around a stars are larger , and more common , than those observed around g stars ( su et al .",
    "2006 ) , yet the timescale for the duration of the phenomena is slightly shorter around a stars compared to g stars ( currie et al . 2007 ; cf .",
    "trilling et al .",
    "gautier et al . ( 2007 ) find that debris emission around m dwarfs is even weaker .",
