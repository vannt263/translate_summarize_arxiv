    "lvy flights are random walk processes , in which the lengths of individual jumps are distributed according to a probability density @xmath2 of the asymptotic power - law form @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a scaling factor of physical dimension length , @xmath5= \\mathrm{cm}$ ] .",
    "the resulting motion is spatially scale - free due to the divergence of the jump length variance , @xmath6 .",
    "lvy flights were popularized by benot mandelbrot , who named them after his teacher , french mathematician paul lvy @xcite .",
    "they have been mainly applied in the modeling of search processes , following the original idea by klafter and shlesinger @xcite : while regular random walks in one or two dimensions have a high probability to return to already visited sites , lvy flights combine thorough local search with occasional long excursions , leading them to areas which likely have not been visited before .",
    "this strategy reduces unnecessary oversampling and thus represents an advantage to the searcher .",
    "indeed , trajectories consistent with the long - tailed jump length pattern ( [ jld ] ) have been reported for various animal species @xcite . even for molecular search",
    ", lvy flights may emerge from the topology of the search space @xcite .",
    "due to a mix of modern means of transportation also human motion behavior is characterized by travel lengths with power - law distribution @xcite .",
    "long - tailed distributions of relocation lengths also change significantly the distribution pattern of diseases , as regular diffusion fronts are broken by , for instance , long - distance air travel , thus carrying the disease to completely decoupled places @xcite .    for land - based animals",
    "typical search processes are essentially two - dimensional . in many cases",
    "we may also neglect the vertical dimension for many birds or fishes , when the lateral extension is considerably larger than the maximal height / depth difference of the trajectory .",
    "in such a two - dimensional search space , given its fractal dimension @xmath7 a single lvy flight trajectory can not fully cover the search space in absence of boundaries .",
    "thus , some small area element in the search space may be hit by one single trajectory while it may be missed by another .",
    "in many cases , however , the search space is bounded .",
    "for instance , animals only search for food in their own territory , or the business travel patterns of an individual are confined to a certain country or continent .",
    "moreover it is often relevant to have information about the area coverage of a lvy flight process at finite times .",
    "for instance , a predator often does not cover its entire territory on a single day .",
    "it is therefore of interest to explore the time evolution of the area coverage of lvy flights : how long does it take for the animal to efficiently explore its entire patch , or a disease to reach every little town in a country ?",
    "how large is the area coverage at a given time ?",
    "these questions of area coverage are directly connected with the ergodic properties of lvy flights .",
    "incomplete area coverage of lvy flights is also of interest in view of their ergodic properties .",
    "ergodicity and its violation have recently received considerable interest , following the possibility to record single trajectories of molecules or small tracers in biological matter @xcite .",
    "thus , for anomalous diffusion processes with underlying scale - free motion a weak ergodicity breaking is observed @xcite , such that the mean squared displacement obtained from the time average over a single trajectory is a random variable and significantly different from the corresponding ensemble average , as shown for the subdiffusive continuous time random walk process @xcite .",
    "this behavior contrasts the ergodic behavior of other anomalous diffusion processes such as fractional brownian motion @xcite .",
    "while weak ergodicity violation occurs for processes with diverging characteristic time scales , ergodicity is also violated for lvy flights in infinite media , due to the incomplete area coverage even for infinitely long trajectories @xcite .",
    "confined lvy flights , in contrast , are ergodic @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider radial lvy flights in two - dimensional square areas with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we investigate the time evolution of the effective fractal dimension of the flights for varying stable index @xmath8 . as a complementary measure for the area coverage",
    "we analyze the time evolution of the mean squared displacement up to its saturation .",
    "moreover we analyze the time evolution of the probability density function and its moments .",
    "we also pursue the question on the typical time for the lvy flight to first reach or pass the boundary of the square interval .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review the mathematical foundation of lvy flights . in section iii ,",
    "we consider radial two - dimensional lvy flights in square boxes and numerically study their area coverage in terms of their fractal dimension , their probability density function , evolution of moments , and mean first passage times .",
    "section iv summarizes the results .",
    ", showing 400 steps each in a @xmath9 box under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "starting point was the center of the square area . note the significantly longer excursions for smaller values of @xmath8 .",
    "we chose @xmath10.,width=302 ]    for jump length distributions of the type  ( [ jld ] ) , the variance @xmath11 diverges , while fractional moments @xmath12 of order @xmath13 exist @xcite .",
    "this property directly carries over to the random motion itself and is responsible for several peculiar phenomena .",
    "due to this lack of a finite variance lvy flights have a fractal graph dimension @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this property causes the sample path of a lvy flight to be characterized by occasional long jumps , connecting clusters of more localized jumps .",
    "unvisited holes exist on all scales within the sample path .",
    "this scale - free behavior gives rise to the fact that clusters host smaller clusters , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.trajectory ] .",
    "moreover , the discontinuous jumps on arbitrarily large scales induce a principal discrepancy between first passage and first arrival events .",
    "for instance , while their first passage behavior on a semi - infinite domain obeys the sparre anderson universality @xcite , their first arrival behavior is significantly reduced with decreasing @xmath8 @xcite , as lvy flights strongly overshoot a point target @xcite . on finite domains the first passage behavior",
    "is also modified @xcite .",
    "another interesting effect is the occurrence of multimodal distributions for lvy flights in the presence of steeper than harmonic potentials @xcite .",
    "analytically , the statistics of the lvy flight are dictated by the detailed distribution of individual jump lengths . however , on large scales  when large search spaces are explored for sufficiently long periods of time  we obtain a universal description .",
    "displacements on large time scales are characterized by lvy @xmath8-stable laws , which in the symmetric case are defined in terms of their characteristic function @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 again , @xmath4 is a typical length scale . from the details of the microscopic jump length distribution , only the tail property  ( [ jld ] )",
    "is directly passed on to the asymptotic stable law  ( [ char_func ] ) of macroscopic displacements , including in particular the exact tail exponent @xmath8 .",
    "lvy stable laws emerge as the limit of the sum of independent , identically distributed random variables with diverging variance , by virtue of the generalized central limit theorem @xcite . for @xmath16",
    "this leads to the asymptotic power - law ( [ jld ] ) , while in the limit @xmath17 , we recover a gaussian distribution for @xmath2 with finite moments of all orders .    here , we consider two - dimensional lvy flights in square boxes of edge length @xmath18 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this means that each time the particle crosses one edge of the box , it will enter from the opposite edge .",
    "all lvy flights start from the origin in the center of the square box . for each step in the two dimensional random",
    "walk we draw a ( signed , symmetric ) flight distance @xmath19 , with distribution @xmath20 as in ( [ char_func ] ) , and independently a flight direction @xmath21 , uniformly distributed within @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "the projection of displacements onto the @xmath23-axis is thus @xmath24 .",
    "we call such processes _ radial _ two - dimensional lvy flights .",
    "such radial lvy flights have been used to analyze search processes ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we note that they are slightly different from two - dimensional lvy flights defined in terms of the two - dimensional characteristic function @xmath25^{\\alpha}|\\mathbf{k}|^{\\alpha})$ ] @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we calculate parameters such as the fractal dimension , the mean first passage time , the mean squared displacement , the probability density function and its other moments and follow their temporal evolution .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath0 indicates how completely a fractal graph fills the available embedding space . for a lvy flight evolving in our finite area",
    "the value of the fractal dimension will initially be smaller than two .",
    "starting from the value zero for the first ( few ) point(s ) of the trajectory , if the area is sufficiently large the value of @xmath0 is expected to be the value of the stable index , @xmath7 , as long as the boundary effects do not come into play . in our simulations",
    "we do not see a saturation close to @xmath7 , as we are interested in the finite size effects and therefore choose quite small domains .",
    "due to this finiteness of the domain the lvy flight will eventually cover the entire area and thus the fractal dimension is expected to saturate at the value @xmath1 .",

    "[ fig.fracdim ] , we plotted the time - dependent fractal dimension calculated via the two - dimensional box - counting method for confined lvy flights with different values of @xmath8 ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ) for fixed box size @xmath38 . as expected for all @xmath8",

    "we see that for growing @xmath8 indeed the slope of the curve @xmath40 is smaller , such that the stationary limit is reached slower .",
    "interestingly , for the gaussian limit @xmath41 an intermediate plateau emerges , as indicated by the arrow in the inset of fig .",

    "the mean squared displacement is thus a valid measure for the motion .",

    "in fact , from measuring the mean squared displacement alone one could assume the motion to be confined brownian .",
    "thus , the effect of the boundaries goes beyond ensuring the finiteness of the second moment .",
    "interestingly , the boundary characteristics also have a distinct quantitative effect on the initial dynamics , which we see in fig .  [ fig.ad ] : the associated diffusion coefficient @xmath59 depends on the size of the system . enlarging the box increases the ( finite ) variance of individual jump lengths , thereby increasing @xmath60 .     for moments @xmath61 of arbitrary order @xmath62 .",

    "we generally find an initial power law time dependence , @xmath68 , before the occurrence of saturation . more precisely , from the data for the scaling exponent @xmath69 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.moments ] , we expect that in the asymptotic limit @xmath70 @xmath71    we note that this type of moment scaling is actually a familiar one in the theory of lvy flights .",
    "it also occurs when truncating the distribution  ( [ jld ] ) for the jump lengths at some fixed distance  @xcite , or when considering the effects of a finite ensemble  @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "the truncation distance is analogous to the largest value drawn from a finite ensemble ; in our system this role is played by the finite edge length of the box . in all such cases ,",
    "the initial dynamics resemble an ordinary , unbounded lvy flight , albeit with finite moments of the type  ( [ moments ] ) .",
    "in particular , we conclude that the second moment of bounded motion mimics `` normal '' diffusion , but the associated diffusion coefficient _ must _ depend on the system size parameter @xmath72 : at early times , moments with @xmath73 are adopted from the unbounded lvy flight and are thus independent of @xmath72 . at late times , all moments saturate at @xmath74 .",
    "the typical time scale for the interaction with the boundaries therefore scales as @xmath75 this necessarily implies that @xmath76 the above relation is in nice agreement with our power law fits in fig .",
    "[ fig.ad ] .",
    "the exponent also consistently coincides with the one found for the dependence on the truncation parameter in truncated , but unbounded , lvy flights as anticipated in ref .",

    "we finally analyze the mean first passage time @xmath77 of our confined lvy flights to the boundary of the area . on a semi - infinite domain lvy flights",
    "show the universal sparre anderson scaling @xmath78 of the distribution of first passage times , so the mean first passage time @xmath77 diverges @xcite . on our finite domain",
    "it converges and depends crucially on @xmath8 .",
    "we determined the mean first passage time for lvy flights with different values of @xmath8 and for different box sizes ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) . from scaling arguments",
    "we would expect that the mean first passage time grows like @xmath83 as function of the initial distance from the absorbing boundary , see eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) .",
    "[ fig.mfpt ] depicts the rescaled mean first passage time @xmath84 as function of @xmath8 .",
    "we observe that the scaling relation holds provided we can approximate the lvy flight by a continuous diffusion process .",
    "conversely , by choosing small values for @xmath85 we generate a random walker that escapes the box after only a few number of steps and the universal scaling  ( [ scale ] ) breaks down . from the monotonic nature of the graphs we conjecture that  for certain fixed parameters @xmath4 and @xmath72  one might find an optimal value for the tail parameter @xmath8 which minimizes the mean first passage time .",
    "we note that the analogous first passage time problem in one dimension has been treated elsewhere analytically and numerically @xcite .",
    "a generalization to our two - dimensional problem however is not straightforward : although we fix the scale @xmath86 for individual jump distances @xmath19 , displacements are still affected by random jump directions @xmath21 .",
    "one can argue that in effect , the scale of displacements along the @xmath87 , @xmath88 or radial coordinate is _ not _ fixed , but has a non - trivial relation to the tail parameter @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , such considerations raise the general question of how to appropriately fix a jump length scale for variable stable exponents in multi - dimensional lvy flights .    , for different box sizes . here",
    ", @xmath89-@xmath90 sample trajectories have been used for each data point . ]",
    "area coverage of stochastic processes is an important criteria for the efficiency of search or spreading processes .",
    "here we investigated the time evolution of the time average of the area coverage in finite territories of lvy flights .",
    "as measures we used the fractal dimension , which relaxes to two at sufficiently long times , and moments of displacements of the lvy flight .",
    "consistently , we found that both quantities show a relatively immediate saturation behavior , such that a clear time scale can be determined for reaching full area coverage .",
    "however , this time scale crucially depends on the value of the stable index @xmath8 : when @xmath8 approaches the limiting value two , this time scale increases significantly .",
    "as expected , smaller values for @xmath8 , allowing for longer jump lengths effect more efficient area coverage and thus search efficiency . in general , the number of steps necessary to reach full area coverage is relatively large .",
    "thus searchers using this type of strategy will likely not be able to achieve absolute certainty to find a given target randomly .",
    "a field of vision , as introduced in the search literature , will mellow this problem and render lvy flights a very efficient search strategy .",
    "the analysis of the area coverage is completed with the study of the equilibration behavior of the probability density function of the process , allowing one to distinguish different domains of the stable index @xmath8 ( smaller / larger than one ) up to relatively long times .",
    "moreover the mean first passage time @xmath91 scales with the index @xmath8 and the system size approximately in the scaling fashion @xmath83 .    from the data analysis point of view",
    ", we find that studying one single type of above measures is usually not enough to identify a given motion as a bounded lvy flight .",
    "the fractal dimension does have a characteristic behavior for long - tailed jump lengths , but quite extensive data is necessary to achieve reliable results from a box counting algorithm .",
    "although fitting the spatial distributions by stable laws might agree nicely at early stages of the process , their characteristic heavy tails are quickly reshaped by interactions with the boundaries .",
    "while the mean squared displacement indicates normal diffusion , the associated diffusion constant turns out to depend on the system size and lower order moments indicate super - diffusion .",
    "finally , an analysis based on first passage times only yields decisive results if data on a variety of system sizes is available .",
    "we conclude that usually a combination of methods is necessary to unambiguously determine the lvy flight nature of a given process .",
