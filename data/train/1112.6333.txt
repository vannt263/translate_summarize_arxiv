    "traversable wormholes are hypothetical tunnels in spacetime given by the following line element @xmath0^{-1}\\,dr^2+r^{2}(d\\theta ^{2}+\\sin ^{2}\\theta d\\phi ^{2 } ) \\ , ,    \\label{whmetric}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , @xmath3 , denoted as the redshift function , and the shape function , respectively @xcite .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath3 decreases from infinity to a minimum value @xmath4 , representing the location of the wormhole throat , where @xmath5 , and then increases from @xmath4 back to infinity . for the wormhole to be traversable",
    ", one must demand that there are no horizons present , which are identified as the surfaces with @xmath6 , so that @xmath1 must be finite everywhere .",
    "note that in any region where the @xmath7 coordinate is timelike requires that @xmath8 .",
    "now , a fundamental property of wormholes is the flaring out of the throat , which is translated by the condition @xmath9 @xcite . at the throat @xmath10 , the condition @xmath11 is imposed in order to have wormhole solutions .",
    "it is precisely these restrictions that impose the violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) in classical general relativity . at this stage",
    ", it is important to emphasize that the nec violation involves a stress - energy tensor such that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is any null vector @xcite .",
    "however , recently it has been shown in the context of modified theories of gravity that the matter threading the wormhole may satisfy the energy conditions , and it is precisely the effective stress - energy tensor involving higher order derivatives that is responsible for the violation of the nec .",
    "this approach has been explored in @xmath14 gravity @xcite , curvature - matter couplings @xcite , conformal weyl gravity @xcite and in braneworlds @xcite , amongst other contexts . in this paper , we review some of these scenarios .",
    "in first place , we consider @xmath14 modified theories of gravity , which has recently been extensively explored as a possible cause of the late - time cosmic acceleration ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the action is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and for notational simplicity we consider @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the matter action , defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the matter lagrangian density , in which matter is minimally coupled to the metric @xmath21 and @xmath22 collectively denotes the matter fields .",
    "varying the action with respect to the metric , one deduces the gravitational field equation written in the following form @xmath23 where the effective stress - energy tensor , @xmath24 , is given by @xmath25     \\ , ,      \\label{gravfluid}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 .",
    "the flaring out condition for wormhole geometries imposes @xmath27 , which yields the following generic condition in @xmath14 gravity @xmath28 this condition has been extensively explored in @xcite , and specific wormhole solutions have been found . in principle , one may impose the condition @xmath29 for the normal matter threading the wormhole .",
    "this is extremely useful , as applying local lorentz transformations it is possible to show that the above condition implies that the energy density is positive in all local frames of reference .",
    "note that in general relativity , i.e. , @xmath30 , we regain the condition for the matter stress - energy tensor violation of the nec , i.e. , @xmath31 .    thus , in the context of @xmath14 modified theories of gravity it is the higher order curvature terms , interpreted as a gravitational fluid , that sustain these non - standard wormhole geometries , fundamentally different from their counterparts in general relativity .",
    "an interesting generalization of @xmath14 gravity is a model described by a curvature - matter coupling considered in @xcite .",

    "the coupling constant @xmath37 characterizes the strength of the interaction between @xmath38 and the matter lagrangian .",

    "these conditions have been extensively analysed and specific solutions have been found in @xcite .",
    "braneworld cosmology is an interesting scenario based on the idea that our universe is a @xmath45brane embedded in a five - dimensional bulk . considering that the bulk is vacuous , the induced field equations on the brane",
    "may formally be rewritten by eq .",

    "the first correction term relative to einstein s general relativity is the inclusion of a quadratic term @xmath51 in the stress - energy tensor , arising from the extrinsic curvature terms in the projected einstein tensor , and is given by @xmath52 \\",

    "the second correction term , @xmath54 , is the projection of the 5-dimensional weyl tensor onto the brane , and encompasses nonlocal bulk effects .",
    "the only general known property of this nonlocal term is that it is traceless , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "we have considered , for simplicity , that the cosmological constant on the brane is zero .",
    "note that the quadratic term , i.e. , @xmath56 , is the high energy correction term . from the following approximations @xmath57 , one readily verifies that @xmath51 is dominant for @xmath58 , and negligible in the regime @xmath59 , where @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "now , the condition @xmath42 , yields the following generic condition in braneworld gravity @xmath61 thus , imposing that the stress energy tensor confined on the brane , and threading the wormhole , satisfies the nec , we verify that in addition to the local high - energy bulk effects , nonlocal corrections from the weyl curvature in the bulk may induce a nec violating signature on the brane .",
    "thus , braneworld gravity seems to provide a natural scenario for the existence of traversable wormholes .",
    "in this work , we have explored the possibility that wormholes be supported by modified theories of gravity .",
    "we imposed that the matter threading the wormhole satisfies the energy conditions , and it is the higher order curvature derivative terms ( in the context of @xmath14 gravity and its curvature - matter coupling generalization ) and the local high - energy bulk effects and nonlocal corrections from the weyl curvature in the bulk ( in braneworld gravity ) , that support these nonstandard wormhole geometries , fundamentally different from their counterparts in general relativity .",
