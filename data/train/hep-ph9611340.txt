    "although only partially explored , the high orbital and radial excitations of mesons promise many exciting possibilities .",
    "highly excited mesons are analogous to the well known  rydberg atom \" which for decades has been a useful tool to investigate atomic dynamics . in a similar way , highly excited meson states sample the interaction at large distance and can be treated semi - classically .",
    "it is often remarked that the quark - antiquark interaction  saturates \" at large distance to reflect the possibility of string breaking . that this is not the case is clearly seen by the existence of linear regge trajectories .",
    "for example , the  rho \" trajectory has states at least out to @xmath0@xcite with no obvious departure from linearity . as we emphasize again here",
    ", linear regge trajectories result from light quark kinematics and linear confinement . in this case",
    "the orbital radius is about 7  gev@xmath1 ( for the @xmath0 state ) and the confinement energy is 1.4  gev , well above that needed for string breaking .",
    "a more correct concept of large distance confinement is that the interquark potential continues to rise linearly with coupled hadron channels implying widths to the meson states .",
    "the theoretical description of dominantly orbital states ( dos ) has some attractive simplifying features .",
    "the leading regge trajectory is  classical \" and radially excited states can be treated semi - classically .",
    "furthermore , these dos do not penetrate to small distances so that only the confining interaction needs to be considered .    in this paper the dos regime",
    "is explored with light quark kinematics and an arbitrary superposition of time component vector and scalar confinement .",
    "a feature of this work is the comparison between the global dos spectra in the heavy - light limit compared to mesons containing two light quarks .",
    "we find that in terms of the angular momentum @xmath2 and the radial quantum number @xmath3 , the mass of the light degrees of freedom in both cases is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the regge slope .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath6 depend on the nature of the confinement ( i.e. , the fraction of scalar confinement ) .",
    "the energy @xmath7 is the meson mass in the light - light case but one must add the heavy quark mass in the heavy - light case .",
    "the universal aspect of the spectroscopy ( [ lightmass ] ) is that for a given confinement choice , @xmath8 thus , by a factor of two rescaling of @xmath9 the light - light and heavy - light spectroscopies become identical , at least in the dos regime . in section",
    "2 we establish our semi - classical formalism in the heavy - light limit .",
    "detailed predictions for a mixed vector and scalar linear confinement are worked out in section  3 .",
    "the two light quark meson case is considered in section  4 .",
    "we summarize our results in section  5 .",
    "some results for light - light mesons have been presented earlier@xcite .",
    "a classical quark of mass @xmath10 moving with velocity * v * in an effective scalar potential @xmath11 and a time - component vector potential @xmath12 with a static source at the origin @xmath13 is governed by the lagrangian , @xmath14 where @xmath15 . by the usual methods we obtain the canonical momenta @xmath16 where @xmath17 and the hamiltonian is then @xmath18 by observing that @xmath19 the velocities can be eliminated in ( [ ham ] ) to obtain @xmath20    for large orbital angular momentum @xmath2 the lowest energy orbit will be circular . from ( [ ham ] ) we define",
    "@xmath21 the circular orbit condition ( for @xmath22 ) is @xmath23 where @xmath24 etc . using @xmath25",
    "we find @xmath26 j & = & \\left.\\left[{1\\over2}v ' \\left(v'+\\sqrt{(v')^2 + 4s(s+rs')/r^2}\\right ) + { ss'\\over r}\\right]\\right|_{r = r_0 } r_0 ^ 2 \\ , .",

    "( [ j ] ) can be used to solve for the classical circular orbit radius . for linear confinement , as we will see in the next section , this becomes trivial .",
    "radial oscillations will in general occur and the harmonic oscillator approximation is equivalent to a semi - classical jwkb treatment for large @xmath2 . to obtain the oscillator expansion we square the classical hamiltonian ( [ class - ham ] ) , @xmath27 where we replace @xmath28 by its eigenvalue @xmath7 .",

    "the radial motion equation is simple harmonic with classical frequency @xmath34^{1/2 } \\over m_0-v_0 } \\label{omega}\\ ] ] and hence the quantized eigenvalue is @xmath35 for dos states @xmath36 so squaring ( and dropping the @xmath37 term ) gives @xmath38",
    "our general confinement model here consists of a combination of scalar and time - component vector confinement , both assumed to be of the linear type @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath41 is the  string tension \" . with the assumption of linear confinement and setting the quark mass to zero ,",
    "the expressions for @xmath42 and @xmath2 in ( [ m_0 ] ) and ( [ j ] ) simplify to @xmath43 a regge trajectory @xmath44 from ( [ m_0:simple ] ) and ( [ j : simple ] ) is then linear and its slope @xmath5 is @xmath45 the value for @xmath46 depends only on the fraction of scalar confinement .",
    "two important special cases are :    * pure scalar confinement @xmath47 @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath50 in this case we observe from the circular orbit condition ( [ circ - orbit ] ) that even a zero mass quark travels at a fraction of the speed of light , @xmath51 this is because the scalar interaction acts as if it were massive .",
    "* pure vector confinement @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 from the circular orbit condition ( [ circ - orbit ] ) we see now that as @xmath55 @xmath56 so the quark s velocity goes to unity in the @xmath57 limit .    for a general value of @xmath40",
    "we show in fig .  1 the numerical result for @xmath46 as computed from  ( [ slope ] ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath46 rises nearly linearly over the range @xmath58 . for @xmath40 outside this range @xmath5 remains monotonic , falling asymptotically to zero for negative @xmath40 and continuing to rise for @xmath59 .",
    "a physically appealing model of a heavy - light meson in a highly excited orbital state consists of a straight rotating flux tube with one end fixed . the regge slope for this tube model is@xcite @xmath60 from fig .  1 , and the exact relation ( [ slope ] )",
    ", we see that the slope ( [ tubemodelslope ] ) can be mimicked by the choice @xmath61 .",
    "we next examine the radial excitation energy implied by our general linear confinement  ( [ genlinconf ] ) . from the expression ( [ m^2 ] ) using the result ( [ omega ] ) for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and hence @xmath64 in fig .  2 we display the radial energy factor @xmath6 as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "over the range @xmath58 , @xmath6 increases from @xmath65 to 1 .",
    "as we can see from the general heavy - light results ( [ genhl ] ) , degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath3 occurs only for @xmath66 . from fig .",
    "2 it is clear that @xmath67 is the only degenerate possibility which can be realized and this occurs when @xmath68 corresponding to pure scalar confinement ( for all @xmath40 , @xmath69 , @xmath6 falls in the range @xmath70 ) .",
    "the physical consequence of degeneracy is the prediction of  meson towers \" , where mesons of different angular momenta lie on top of each other . for scalar confinement",
    "@xmath67 and the degeneracy is @xmath71 so for a fixed @xmath9 the next radial excitation will be two units of @xmath2 different .",
    "we now proceed to the case of mesons composed of two equal mass quarks@xcite .",
    "the center of momentum point lies equidistant between the quarks which have a relative displacement @xmath72 .",
    "the lagrangian describing the classical motion is then @xmath73 where the velocity of one quark is given by @xmath74 and @xmath75 the canonical momenta are @xmath76 where @xmath77 with the hamiltonian , @xmath78 noting that @xmath79 we have @xmath80 comparing the above two - particle hamiltonian ( [ 2-part - ham ] ) with the single - particle hamiltonian  ( [ class - ham ] ) we note that , in the @xmath55 limit , the momentum must be half the one - particle momentum to give the same hamiltonian since @xmath81 .",
    "this means that for a given energy both the radial and the angular momentum are one half the one light quark case .",
    "the latter implies that the regge slope is one half the one - particle slope , or @xmath82 in addition , the radial momentum is one half the one light quark case which means that the radial frequency @xmath62 is twice the heavy - light frequency .",
    "the result is that again the meson spectrum can be written as @xmath83 where @xmath84 , exactly the same as in the heavy - light case ( [ genhl ] ) . in the two light quark meson",
    "though , @xmath85 in this case @xmath7 is the actual meson mass whereas in the heavy - light case ( [ genhl ] ) we must add the heavy quark mass to @xmath7 .",
    "we have demonstrated that both heavy - light and light - light mesons , in dominantly orbital states ( dos ) , exhibit a universal pattern of excitation . in particular the ratio of radial to orbital excitation energy",
    "depends only on the type of linear confinement .",
    "the scale of excitation , e.g.  the regge slope , also depends on the confinement but is exactly twice as large for the heavy - light mesons as for the light - light mesons .    in the dos regime",
    "orbital - radial degeneracy , giving rise to meson towers , only appears for scalar confinement . in this case",
    "the orbital excitation energy is half the radial energy reminiscent of the non - relativistic harmonic oscillator potential . at low angular momentum the quark s  penetrating orbits \" lower the radial states relative to the orbital states due to the attractive short range interaction .",
    "although we have used a semi - classical method of description it should give reliable results in the dos sector .",
    "an obvious defect is the neglect of quark spin which even at large range can give a spin - orbit energy .",
    "if such a multi - component wave equation possesses leading regge structure it will be the same as in this work .",
    "it turns out that for scalar confinement in the salpeter equation the leading term does in fact cancel whereas it does not in the dirac equation@xcite .",
    "another possible area of extension is to quark interactions of a four - potential type .",
    "the consideration of a spatial vector potential would include flux tube models .",
    "for this special case the regge slope factor of two has already been noted@xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that the flux tube exhibits the same @xmath86 degeneracy as pure scalar confinement@xcite .",
