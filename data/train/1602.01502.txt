    "light pseudoscalar mesons are of great interest in hadron and nuclear physics , in large part because they are the nambu - goldstone modes which arise as a consequence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) and quite likely , therefore , play a material role in the realisation of confinement within the standard model .",
    "it follows that comparisons between kaon and pion properties can reveal the relative impact of explicit and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on hadron properties in an environment where those impacts are likely to be most heavily felt . in proceeding toward an understanding of nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ,",
    "it is important to expose and explain the effects of this interplay on the gluon and quark parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) within these hadrons .",
    "naturally , to be truly informative , feedback between experiment and theory is crucial @xcite .    experimental data on pion and kaon pdfs is , however , sparse .",
    "it has only been obtained in mesonic drell - yan scattering from nucleons in heavy nuclei , with information on the pion s pdfs reported in refs.@xcite and results for the ratio of kaon and pion distribution functions presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "newer data is not available ; but would be welcome , owing to persistent doubts about the large bjorken-@xmath5 behaviour of the pion s valence - quark pdf @xcite and because a single modest - quality measurement of the kaon - to - pion ratio can not be considered definitive .",
    "an approved experiment @xcite , using tagged deep inelastic scattering at the upgraded jefferson laboratory ( jlab12 ) , should contribute to a resolution of the pion question ; and a similar technique might also serve for the kaon .",
    "such studies are part of an extensive and diverse range of hadron structure experiments planned at jlab12 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , new mesonic drell - yan measurements at modern facilities could yield valuable information on @xmath6 and @xmath7 pdfs @xcite , as could two - jet experiments at the large hadron collider @xcite ; and , looking further ahead , an electron ion collider would be capable of providing access to pion and kaon structure functions through measurements of forward nucleon structure functions @xcite .",
    "the calculation of pion and kaon internal structure would at first sight seem to be straightforward , since these systems are bound - states involving just two valence quarks .",
    "however , here first impressions are misleading owing to both the loss of particle number conservation in quantum field theory and dcsb , which together place severe constraints on any approach to the computation of pion and kaon properties .",
    "a valid framework must be capable of simultaneously explaining these systems as conventional bound - states in quantum field theory and nambu - goldstone modes , with all the incumbent corollaries ( _ e.g_.  refs.@xcite ) ; and most models fail this test .",
    "we will therefore address the problem using qcd s dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) @xcite , which are well suited to this exercise because of the existence of nonperturbative , symmetry - preserving truncation schemes @xcite that readily accommodate and explain the dichotomy of nature s nambu - goldstone modes .",
    "early dse predictions and results from other approaches are reviewed elsewhere @xcite , and some more recent theoretical analyses are described in refs.@xcite .",
    "herein , we choose to follow ref.@xcite and develop an insightful perspective on kaon and pion pdfs using an algebraic framework that has also proven useful in studies of meson parton distribution amplitudes @xcite .    following this introduction , sec.[secqdfs ] , provides a little background to the measurement of pdfs and theoretical expectations .",
    "in sec.[seccomputing ] we introduce formulae for meson valence dressed - quark pdfs , describe an algebraic framework that enables their straightforward computation and detail insights this provides .",
    "section  [ secbuilding ] explains why , even at a typical hadronic scale , the valence dressed - quark structure of mesons as perceived in deep inelastic processes must be augmented by sea - quark and gluon contributions ; and details a simple but realistic means of achieving this . that positions us to describe comparisons with extant data in sec.[secdrawing ] and reveal insights that such comparisons suggest .",
    "we conclude in sec.[secepilogue ] .",

    "bjorken-@xmath5 is equivalent to the light - front momentum fraction of the struck parton ; and the structure function may be computed from the imaginary part of the virtual - photon  meson forward compton scattering amplitude : @xmath17 @xcite .    the sum in eq .",

    "notably , in the @xmath24-parity symmetric limit , which we employ throughout , @xmath25 . on the other hand , one expects @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , the large difference between the current - masses of the @xmath27-quark and the @xmath3- and @xmath28-quarks should lead to some very interesting effects in the kaon structure function , _",
    "e.g_.  owing to its larger mass , the @xmath27-quark should carry more of the charged - kaon s momentum than the @xmath3 quark and hence the valence @xmath3-quark distribution in the kaon should peak at @xmath29 .",
    "just how much less depends on the interplay between explicit and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "here it is worth reiterating one of the earliest predictions of the qcd parton model , augmented by features of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , _",
    "i.e_.  at large bjorken-@xmath5 and at a scale characteristic of nonperturbative qcd , @xmath30 , the valence - quark distribution function in a pseudoscalar meson behaves as follows @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an anomalous dimension .",
    "verification of eq",
    ". will serve as an important milestone on the path toward confirmation of qcd as the theory of strong interactions . in this connection",
    "we recall that ref.@xcite ( the e615 experiment ) reported a pion valence - quark pdf obtained via a leading - order ( lo ) pqcd analysis of their data , _",
    "viz_.  @xmath33 , seemingly a marked contradiction of eq .. subsequent dse computations @xcite confirmed eq . and eventually prompted reconsideration of the e615 analysis , with the result that at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and including soft - gluon resummation @xcite , the e615 data can be viewed as being consistent with eq .. new data are essential in order to check this reappraisal of the e615 data and settle the controversy .",
    "these remarks highlight the value of theoretical methods that possess a realistic connection with qcd and can provide precise , reliable results for parton distribution functions on the valence - quark domain .",
    "again , most models fail in this regard , _",
    "e.g_.  claiming agreement with the e615 data as a success and ignoring the conflict with eq .. lattice - qcd , too , is challenged in this respect .",

    "in calculating valence dressed - quark distribution functions for the kaon and pion , we follow ref.@xcite , which demonstrated that the impulse - approximation ( _ handbag _ ) expression typically used to define these distribution functions is deficient because it omits contributions from the gluons which bind quarks into the meson .",

    "in order to determine @xmath122 , we note that with realistic masses , meson - loop corrections to the pion electromagnetic form factor at @xmath125 are an o(5% ) effect .",

    "such results are available for @xmath19 , _",
    "e.g_.  a contemporary simulation @xcite , using two dynamical fermion flavours , @xmath199gev and nonperturbative renormalisation at @xmath198gev , produces the first row here : @xmath200 the results in ref.@xcite agree with those obtained in earlier estimates based on simulations of quenched lqcd @xcite and are consistent with the values obtained from our computed distribution , which are reported in the last row of eq ..    our predictions in eq .",

    "yields the following values for the first three moments : @xmath204 ; and consequently predicts that two - thirds of the pion s momentum is carried by valence - quarks at this scale .",
    "no lqcd results are yet available for moments of the kaon distributions ; but our predictions for the first three moments of each distribution are : @xmath205 they are obtained from the lo - evolution of our results for @xmath206 to @xmath202 , which are satisfactorily interpolated by the form in eq . using the second and third rows of coefficients in eq",
    ".. it is evident from these results that valence - quarks carry approximately two - thirds of the kaon s momentum at @xmath202 .",
    "we employed a dressed - quark basis to analyse parton distribution functions of the pion and kaon .",
    "the expressions that define these distributions [ eqs . , ] overcome weaknesses of the impulse approximation and ensure that , independent of model details , the dressed - quarks express a purely valence distribution , _",
    "viz_.  they always carry the entirety of a given meson s light - front momentum [ eqs .",
    ", ] , and the valence - quark distribution behaves as @xmath0 on @xmath163 [ eq . ] . using algebraic formulae for the dressed - quark propagators and pion and kaon bethe - salpeter amplitudes , which express effects associated with both explicit and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and produce the correct conformal - limit meson parton distribution amplitudes",
    ", we computed the valence dressed - quark pdfs for the pion and kaon [ fig.[figpdfsq0 ] ] .",
    "the results demonstrate that it is the flavour - dependence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking which modulates the strength of @xmath2-flavour symmetry breaking in meson pdfs .",
    "we subsequently explained why , even at a typical hadronic scale , the valence dressed - quark structure of mesons as perceived in deep inelastic processes must be augmented by sea - quark and gluon contributions ; and detailed a simple but realistic means of achieving this .",
    "the corrections may be divided into two classes : [ c1 ] , which redistributes baryon - number and momentum into the dressed - quark sea ; and [ c2 ] , which shifts momentum into the pion s dressed - gluon distribution .",
    "our analysis suggests that contributions within [ c2 ] are most important at an hadronic scale ,",
    "_ viz_.  @xmath207 .    working with this information",
    ", we built a simple algebraic model to express the principal impact of both classes of corrections on the pion and kaon , which , combined with the predictions of the dressed - quark basis , permitted a realistic comparison with existing experiment .",
    "this enabled us to reveal essential features of these mesons valence - quark distributions .",
    "namely , at a characteristic and reasonable hadronic scale , @xmath30 , valence dressed - quarks carry roughly two - thirds of the pion s light - front momentum , with the bulk of the remainder carried by glue .",
    "in contrast , valence dressed - quarks carry approximately 95% of the kaon s light - front momentum at @xmath30 , with the remainder lying in the gluon distribution .",
    "this difference may be attributed to the fact that heavier quarks radiate soft gluons less readily than lighter quarks and momentum conservation communicates this effect to the kaon s @xmath3-quark .",
    "evolving our corrected distributions to a scale characteristic of meson - nucleon drell - yan experiments , we reproduced and explained extant data on the kaon - to - pion ratio of @xmath3-quark distributions [ fig.[figukusratio ] ] and the pion s @xmath3-quark distribution [ fig.[figxuvpi ] ] .",
    "as a complement to these results , we also evolved the distributions to the resolving scale @xmath198gev , which is typically used in numerical simulations of lattice - regularised qcd . here",
    ", valence - quarks carry roughly one - half of the pion s light - front momentum but two - thirds of the kaon s momentum .",
    "a valuable opportunity now presents itself .",
    "namely , it should be possible to employ the methods exploited in refs.@xcite and follow the procedures in secs.[secbuilding ] , [ secdrawing ] above so as to achieve a quantitatively reliable , qcd - connected unification of meson valence - quark distribution functions ( pdf ) with , _ inter alia _ ,",
