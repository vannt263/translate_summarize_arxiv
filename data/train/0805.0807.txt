    "the small - world phenomenon is one of the most intriguing properties of human society .",
    "this describes the fact that unrelated people in a society , who are a very large geographic distance apart from one another , tend to be connected by surprisingly short chains of acquaintances .",
    "this phenomenon was hypothesized in 1929 by hungarian author frigyes karinthy  @xcite and was first observed experimentally in the 1960 s with sociologist stanley milgram s seminal experiments  @xcite wherein randomly chosen people were selected to mail a letter to an unknown target person , but were only allowed to send the letter to a friend , who would pass the letter along to another friend , etc .",
    ", until the target was reached .",
    "successful transmissions took surprisingly few intermediate people , lending credibility to the turn of phrase ` six degrees of separation , ' popularized by karinthy . understanding this phenomenon is an important sociological problem .",
    "to study the underlying mechanism that led to milgram s results , computer scientist jon kleinberg modeled a society as follows  @xcite .",
    "begin with a large , regular square @xmath8 lattice .",
    "each node is connected to its nearest lattice neighbors and to a single random node a large distance away .",
    "the probability of nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 being connected by such a long range contact is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the euclidian distance between the two nodes and the sum runs over all nodes in the network except @xmath9 .",
    "physically , the local lattice connections represent associations with immediate neighbors , fellow townspeople , etc . , while long - range contacts might model friends or relatives in another city or country .",
    "we seek to pass the message from a random starting node @xmath13 to a random target @xmath14 .",
    "of great importance is the fact that each node has no information beyond the locations of its contacts and the target node @xmath14 , so the operational algorithm must be _ local _ in character .",
    "kleinberg has proved that no local algorithm can do better , functionally , than the _ greedy _ algorithm  @xcite : each message holder passes the message along to whichever of its contacts is closest to @xmath14 , until the message reaches the target .",
    "moreover , for @xmath15 the delivery time @xmath16 ( number of intermediate steps ) scales as a _ power _ of @xmath6 , while small world behavior and the weakest dependence on lattice size emerges for @xmath7 , where @xmath17 .",
    "the distribution of nodes on a regular square lattice is too rigid , failing to mimic important features of actual distributions of populations ( or computer routers , etc . ) . in an effort to account for these",
    "we have studied kleinberg navigation in fractals  @xcite , showing that the optimal long - contact exponent is then @xmath18 , the fractal dimension of the lattice . in this letter",
    "we study the effects of anisotropy  another commonly encountered distortion of the ideal kleinberg lattice .",
    "our results indicate that in the limit of lattice size @xmath4 the optimal contact exponent for two - dimensional lattices is still @xmath7 . for finite @xmath6",
    ", we find an optimal exponent @xmath5 quite different from the infinite limit . the convergence to @xmath7 as @xmath4 shows interesting power - law dependence on the anisotropy strength .",
    "we wish to study the isolated effect of anisotropy on kleinberg navigation .",
    "to do this , we begin with a regular square lattice ( @xmath19 ) and introduce one of two forms of anisotropy .",
    "* * lattice anisotropy : * the underlying lattice is stretched horizontally , along the @xmath20-axis , by a factor @xmath21 , such that the area of each cell goes from @xmath22 to @xmath23 . * * angular anisotropy : * long - range contacts are chosen preferably along the vertical direction , by a factor @xmath21 .",
    "more precisely , the random angle @xmath24 of each long - range contact vector ( measured counter - clockwise , from the @xmath20-axis ) is modified to @xmath25 : @xmath26    both of these types of anisotropy tend to favor connections in the vertical @xmath27-direction , if @xmath28 , and along the @xmath20-direction , if @xmath29 .",
    "to simulate kleinberg navigation efficiently , we use several tricks and approximations .",
    "first , rather than testing a finite - size square @xmath8 lattice , we consider an infinite lattice and place the source and target at distance @xmath6 from one another .",
    "since the message always progresses toward the target , by the greedy algorithm , the message holder remains within a disc of radius @xmath6 centered on the target node , so in practice only a finite number of sites would be explored anyways .",
    "second , the computation of the normalizing sum in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : kleinbergnavigationprob ] ) is dependent ( in finite lattices ) upon the location of the node @xmath9 , and can be very time consuming .",
    "the infinite lattice circumvents this problem , as the normalizing constant is the same for all nodes .",
    "note , however , that @xmath30 does not converge for @xmath31 . in that case",
    ", we imagine a lattice larger than the @xmath6-disc of activity , with periodic boundary conditions , such that the normalizing factor is still the same for all sites .    because of the monotonic progression toward the target no site",
    "is ever revisited in the process . moreover , as observed by kleinberg  @xcite , one can think of the long - contact link out of node @xmath9 as being created at the very instant that the message arrives at @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the full lattice is unnecessary , and we need keep in memory only the current location of the message holder ( and the location of the target ) .",
    "when the message arrives at @xmath9 , we create a random long contact , compare the distances of all five neighbors of @xmath9 ( the four lattice neighbors and the long contact ) to the target , and move the message to the site closest to the target .",
    "the long contact is created by choosing a random distance and angle , @xmath32 . in order to reproduce the correct @xmath33 the distance @xmath0",
    "is taken from the distribution @xmath34 , to account for the linear growth of the area of the ring where the contact might fall .",
    "the angle @xmath24 is distributed uniformly between 0 and @xmath35 . in the case of angular anisotropy ,",
    "@xmath24 is replaced by @xmath25 , according to  ( [ eqn : anisoangledef ] ) .",
    "finally , a vector @xmath32 is drawn from site @xmath9 and the contact is placed on the site @xmath10 closest to the vector tip .",
    "because of the anisotropy , the angular displacement from the source to the target makes a difference .",
    "it is sufficient to test only the two extremes of @xmath36 and @xmath37 where the target is either parallel or perpendicular to the anisotropy direction .",
    "we note , however , that anisotropy strength @xmath38 and a target at @xmath36 is equivalent to anisotropy @xmath39 and target at @xmath37 . for this reason",
    ", we simply set the source and target at @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , throughout , and let @xmath38 vary both below and above the isotropic divide of @xmath42 .",
    "simulations were performed for various values of @xmath38 over a large range of @xmath2 and @xmath6 , each averaged 1000 times . for each @xmath38 and @xmath6 ,",
    "the minimum @xmath2 was computed by first fitting a fifth - order polynomial to the averaged data , then using newton s method on the polynomial s derivative .",
    "finally @xmath43 was plotted as a function of @xmath44 for each chosen value of @xmath38 .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisodata ] and indicate that @xmath45 as @xmath46 , regardless of @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : accuracyextrap ] we show detailed results of the extrapolation to @xmath4 .    to further clarify the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisodata ] , the following procedure was performed .",
    "first fit a cubic polynomial @xmath47 , using least squares , to each @xmath38 s curve .",
    "then , subtract that polynomial from the isotropic case , @xmath48 .",
    "this maps @xmath42 to the horizontal axis and gives the behavior of the @xmath49 curves `` relative '' to the isotropic curve .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : renormedcubics ] .",
    "the different behavior for each type of anisotropy is clear : for both types of anisotropy the results for @xmath28 show dramatic differences from the isotropic case of @xmath42 ( the differences for @xmath50 and large @xmath6 are negligible ) . for lattice anisotropy ,",
    "the @xmath28 curves start above the @xmath42 curve and cross below until they eventually converge at a similar rate , as @xmath4 . for the angular anisotropy",
    ", the @xmath28 curves approach @xmath51 at a different rate than the @xmath42 curve , resulting in distinctly different slopes in the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : angleanisodata ] .",
    "the observed `` crossover '' behavior present in the lattice anisotropy is somewhat unexpected . the crossover point , @xmath52 ,",
    "is explored by finding the zero of each @xmath48 .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : logloglatticecrossover]a , and seem to indicate a power law relationship , @xmath53 .",
    "likewise , the different slopes for angular anisotropy , plotted in fig .  [ fig : logloglatticecrossover]b , show power - law behavior and seem to increase roughly as @xmath54 . what is responsible for these phenomena remains an open question .",
    "we have shown , by extensive numerical simulations , that kleinberg navigation in two - dimensional lattices with two types of anisotropy displays the same gross characteristics as navigation in isotropic lattices .",
    "in particular , the optimal long - contact exponent in the limit of infinitely distant source and target remains @xmath7 , even in the presence of anisotropy .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the actual values for the optimal exponent @xmath5 for finite @xmath6 can differ considerably from the limit @xmath7 , even for reasonably large lattices .",
    "thus , for practical applications the optimal exponent ought to be evaluated on a case by case basis .",
    "the modes of convergence to the limit @xmath4 show intriguing power - law dependence upon the strength of the anisotropy .",
    "a theoretical explanation for this behavior remains the subject of future work .",
