    "the majority of nearby agn and agn candidates have nuclear optical spectra that are dominated by emission lines of low ionization species such as [ oi ]  @xmath26300 ,  and @xcite .",
    "this class of agn was first defined by @xcite as liners ( low ionization narrow emission - line regions ) .",
    "liners have lower luminosities than seyfert galaxies or quasars and are therefore often referred to as low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagn ) .",
    "liner emission is extremely common in the nuclei of galaxies ; up to @xmath3 of all galaxies have nuclear spectra typical of liners @xcite . despite the prevalence of liners in galaxies and decades of study ,",
    "the power source of liners is still under debate .",

    "these observations provide circumstantial evidence for an agn power source for the liner emission .",
    "other possible power sources include fast shocks @xcite , photoionization by hot stars @xcite , or photoionization by an old , metal - rich stellar population @xcite .",

    "similar features have been detected in some seyfert galaxies from nuclear starbursts that are a few myr old @xcite .",

    "@xcite found that while massive stars do not contribute significantly to liner spectra , high order balmer absorption lines are detected in @xmath4% of liners that have relatively weak  emission .",
    "these results indicate that the current liner classification scheme encompasses two or more types of galaxies , or galaxies at different stages in evolution .",
    "liners are commonly classified using their optical emission - line ratios .",
    "the first optical classification classification scheme to segregate liners from other spectral types was proposed by @xcite .",
    "this scheme uses line ratios of the low ionization species [ ] @xmath5 and  @xmath6 compared to the high ionization species [ ] @xmath7 to separate liners from seyferts .",
    "this scheme requires the use of additional diagnostics to remove star - forming galaxies .",
    "the most common method to remove star - forming galaxies is based on the @xcite empirical diagnostic diagrams using the optical line ratios , , , and .",
    "the baldwin et al .",
    "scheme was revised by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an alternative scheme was proposed by @xcite that includes an additional division between `` pure '' liners and liner/  `` transition '' objects using the  ratio .",
    "transition objects have line ratios that are intermediate between the two classes .",
    "this division is arbitrary because there was no clear division in  between transition or true liner classes .",
    "the first purely theoretical classification scheme to distinguish between agn , liners , and region - like objects was derived by @xcite .",
    "they used a combination of modern stellar population synthesis , photoionization , and shock models to derive a `` maximum starburst line '' and an `` extreme mixing line '' for separation of the three types of objects .",
    "kewley et al .",
    "concluded that previous liner classification schemes include starburst - seyfert composites in the liners class , as well as bona - fide liners .",
    "recently , @xcite shifted the kewley et al . extreme starburst line to make a semi - empirical fit to the outer bound of @xmath8 sdss spectra .",
    "this outer bound defines the region where composite starburst - agn objects are expected to lie on the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "although much progress has been made in the optical classification of the ionizing source in galaxies , none of these classification schemes has been able to divide cleanly between seyfert , liner and composite / transition types .",
    "the primary reason for this problem is the lack of a sufficiently large sample in which empirical boundaries between the different galaxy classes can be observed . in this paper",
    ", we use 85,224 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 4 ( dr4 ) emission - line catalog ( described in section  [ sample ] ) to develop a new semi - empirical classification scheme for seyferts , liners , and composite objects ( section  [ class ] ) .",
    "we use this new classification scheme to investigate the host properties of agn in section  [ host ] .",
    "our results are discussed in section  [ discussion ] and we present our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .    throughout this paper ,",

    "@xcite analysed the effect of a fixed size aperture on metallicity , star - formation rate , and reddening .",
    "they concluded that a minimum aperture covering fraction of @xmath16% is required for the spectral properties within the aperture to approximate the global values . for the @xmath17 fiber aperture of the sdss , a 20% covering",
    "fraction corresponds roughly to a redshift of @xmath18 .",
    "our upper redshift limit avoids incompleteness in the liner class .",
    "liners typically have lower luminosities than seyfert galaxies , and are therefore found at lower redshifts than seyferts in the magnitude - limited sdss survey .",
    "we will investigate incompleteness as a function of galaxy type in section  [ new_class ]    the resulting sample contains 85224 emission - line galaxies and does not include duplicates found in the original dr4 catalog .",
    "we use the publically available emission - line fluxes ( described in @xcite ) .",
    "these fluxes were calculated using a sophisticated technique that applies a least - squares fit of stellar population synthesis models and dust attenuation to the continuum . once the continuum has been removed , the emission - line fluxes were fit with gaussians , constraining the width and velocity separation of the balmer lines together , and similarly for the forbidden lines .",
    "we have corrected the emission - line fluxes for extinction using the balmer decrement and the @xcite reddening curve .",
    "we assume an @xmath19 and an intrinsic h@xmath20/h@xmath21 ratio of 2.85 for galaxies dominated by star formation and h@xmath22h@xmath23 for galaxies dominated by agn ( the balmer decrement for case b recombination at t@xmath24k and @xmath25 ; * ? ? ?",
    "a total of 5414 ( 6% ) of galaxies in our sample have balmer decrements less than the theoretical value . a balmer decrement less than the theoretical value can result from one or a combination of ( 1 ) intrinsically low reddening , ( 2 ) errors in the stellar absorption correction , and ( 3 ) errors in the line flux calibration and measurement . for the s /",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the host properties of 85224 emission - line galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> we show that seyferts and liners form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star - forming galaxies , composite agn- galaxies , seyferts and liners and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects . </S>",
    "<S> liners are older , more massive , less dusty and more concentrated , and they and have higher velocity dispersions and lower [ oiii ] luminosities than seyfert galaxies . seyferts and liners are most strongly distinguished by their [ oiii ] luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the quantity l[oiii]/@xmath0 , which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the eddington rate . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find that at _ fixed _ l[oiii]/@xmath0 , all differences between seyfert and liner host properties disappear . </S>",
    "<S> liners and seyferts form a continuous sequence , with liners dominant at low @xmath1 and seyferts dominant at high @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the majority of liners are agn and that the seyfert / liner dichotomy is analogous to the high / low - state transition for x - ray binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> we apply theoretical photo - ionization models and show that pure liners require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than seyfert galaxies , consistent with the low and high x - ray binary states . </S>"
