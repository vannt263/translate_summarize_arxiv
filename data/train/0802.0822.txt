    "therefore , thestudy is sufficient to be confined in the duration ( 0 , @xmath54 ) . under the thomas - fermi approximation , @xmath55  ( for @xmath39rb ) .",

    "\\(iii ) if @xmath2  is even , @xmath60  must be even so that @xmath10 can be zero .",
    "when @xmath61 , starting from the initial state that half atoms are spin - up while the other half are spin - down , @xmath62 goes up directly to @xmath63 without oscillation as shown by the black curve in [ cf1]a . from this curve",
    "we know that half of the @xmath64 atoms become @xmath65  within @xmath66 , it certainly implies the occurrence of strong spin - flips @xmath67 .",

    "therefore there are zones of oscillation ( zoo ) and zones of steady evolution ( zos ) .",
    "they appear alternately , namely , zoo - zos - zoo as shown by the dark cyan curve , and again . in general , when @xmath71 , a larger @xmath60  leads to a broader zoo and accordingly a narrower zos .",

    "meanwhile , the average frequency of oscillation in the zoo is equal to @xmath79 , which @xmath80 for our parameters .",
    "it can be imagined that , when @xmath2  is very large , the frequency would be very high and the zoo would appear as a band with a width .",
    "\\(vi ) when @xmath60  is close to @xmath81 , the duration of the zoo becomes very long ( close to @xmath82 , and the amplitude of oscillation becomes very small except in a small domain close to @xmath83 as shown by the green curve in [ cf1]a .",
    "accordingly , the zos in between becomes very narrow and unsteady .",
    "\\(vii ) when @xmath84 , the two previous zoos transform to zoss , while the previous zos becomes to a very narrow zoo containing only one round of oscillation situated at @xmath83 as shown by the top curve in [ cf1]a .",
    "fig.[cf1]a is for the cases with @xmath85 .",
    "the cases with @xmath86 are given in fig.[cf3]a .",
    "it was found that @xmath58 and @xmath87 are one - to - one roughly similar , however they are greatly different when @xmath32  is close to 0 or @xmath54 .",
    "the early stage of evolution is referred to fig.[cf2]a and [ cf4]a .",
    "when @xmath88 , via the procedure of diagonalization , we obtain the following numerical results .",
    "\\(i ) weak field    the evolutions of @xmath58 are given in the ( b ) and ( c ) panels of fig.[cf1 ] to [ cf4 ] , we found    \\(i ) the effect of @xmath4  is very sensitive if @xmath60  is close to 0 or @xmath2 .",
    "otherwise @xmath58 is less affected .",
    "note that @xmath89 of the lowest three curves in [ cf1]a ( [ cf3]a ) are much higher ( lower ) than their @xmath90 .",
    "the effect of @xmath4 is to pull them down ( push them up ) so that @xmath91 are closer to @xmath90 .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath62 and @xmath92 are extremely sensitive to @xmath4 .",
    "this is shown by the black curves in [ cf1]b and [ cf3]b .",
    "the black curve representing @xmath62 in fig.1a is greatly pulled down by the field when @xmath93 ( [ cf1]b ) , and it becomes nearly a horizontal line close to zero when @xmath94 ( [ cf1]c ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath95 the spin - flips which occurs strongly in the early stage is severely suppressed by the field .    for @xmath92 with all the atoms in @xmath65 initially ,",
    "we know from fig.[cf3 ] that 64% ( 74% ) of the atoms would be changed to @xmath64 at 0.008@xmath96 ( 0.005@xmath96 ) if @xmath45 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "thus , instead of being suppressed , the strong spin - flips in the early stage are accelerated by @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , a strong oscillation is thereby induced .",
    "when @xmath4=10 , the oscillation is stronger in the duration ( @xmath83,@xmath54 ) , refer to the black and red curves of [ cf3]b . when @xmath4=30 , the oscillation is extremely strong through out nearly all the time ( black curve of [ cf3]c ) , this is a noticeable point and we will return to it .",
    "\\(iii ) when @xmath60  is neither close to 0 nor @xmath2 , the effect of @xmath4  would be to shorten the zoo and enlarge the zos if @xmath97  ( e.g. , the duration of the zoo of the dark cyan curve of 1c is @xmath98  instead of @xmath77 in [ cf1]a ) , or reversely if @xmath99 ( e.g. , refer to the pink curves in fig.[cf3 ] ) .",
    "another effect of @xmath4 is to spoil the stability of the zos , and cause  irregular \" oscillation in both zoo and zos .",
    "\\(iv ) it seems that a new mode of oscillation might be caused by @xmath4 .",
    "this is hinted , say , by the wavy pink curves in [ cf3]b , [ cf3]c , and the blue curve in [ cf1]c .",
    "this point is further studied below .",
    "\\(v ) the strict periodicity and the inherent symmetry exist no more if @xmath100 .",
    "\\(ii ) strong field    the early stage of evolution of @xmath58 under a strong field is plotted in fig.[cf5 ] within the duration ( 0 , @xmath101 ) . comparing 5a with fig.[cf2]c",
    ", we found that the curves with @xmath60  close to zero are further suppressed so that @xmath102 @xmath90  together with a negligible oscillation . comparing 5a with fig.[cf4]c , the curves with @xmath60close to @xmath2 keep their oscillation .",
    "the curves with @xmath60  neither very small nor very large are relatively less affected , and they become more or less similar to each other as shown by the blue , pink , and navy curves of [ cf5]a . for these curves the division into zoo and zos holds no more.@xmath103 of all the curves in 5a are close to @xmath90 .",
    "when the field is even stronger as in [ cf5]b , a new mode of oscillation emerges , where the new patterns contain a series of pulses , each has an olivary shape and includes certain rounds of oscillation inside .",
    "the number of round would decrease if @xmath60 increases .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillation is larger if @xmath104 , and it will be too small to be seen if @xmath105 or @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath4 increases further , the olives would become longer and thinner , and include more rounds . in the strong @xmath4  limit",
    "the oscillation is completely suppressed and all @xmath58 become just horizontal lines .    when @xmath4 is sufficiently large , the first term of the hamiltonian @xmath106  can be considered as a perturbation .",
    "the set of the first order perturbative solutions of the hamiltonian is @xmath107 with this set , @xmath108  ( eq.([e3 ] ) ) can be calculated analytically .",
    "accordingly , we have @xmath109   \\label{e8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110\\omega $ ] , @xmath111  eq.([e7 ] ) and ( [ e8 ] ) holds if @xmath112    when @xmath57  and @xmath113 and @xmath114 , thus @xmath115    when @xmath57  and @xmath116 and @xmath117 , thus @xmath118    both ( [ e9 ] ) and ( [ e10 ] ) imply a small oscillation around a horizontal line as shown in [ cf5]b , where the amplitude of the black curve is too small to be seen .",
    "when @xmath60 is neither close to 0 nor @xmath17 , the sum of @xmath119 and @xmath120 is much larger than their difference",

    "this explains the origin of the olivary shapes .",
    "the factor @xmath124  has a period @xmath125 therefore the length of the olive would tend to @xmath126 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath127 would oscillate around @xmath128 $ ] , where the second term is small , as shown in ( [ e11 ] ) and in fig.[cf5]b .",
    "the above numerical results are obtained with @xmath129 and @xmath47 . from the formula of our previous paper @xcite we know that the change of @xmath56 is simply equivalent to a change of the scale of time , i.e. , all the curves of @xmath130 would remain unchanged except that the implication of @xmath96 is changed with @xmath56 via the relation @xmath131 . on the other hand , since @xmath132 , the decrease of @xmath133  will slightly increase the ratio @xmath134 , therefore will amplify slightly the effect of @xmath4 .    when @xmath2  changes , the period is also changed due to @xmath135 .",
    "when the time is re - scaled , the effect of @xmath2  on the evolution is mild if @xmath136 .",
    "this is shown in fig.[cf6]a where @xmath137 .",
    "fig.[cf6]a is very similar to fig.[cf1]a although @xmath2  is ten times larger ( note that the time scales of these two figures are different ) . in particular ,",
    "the zoo  and zos exist , and the rounds of oscillation contained in the zoo is also @xmath138 .",
    "furthermore , the zoo of the dark cyan curve in [ cf6]a has also the duration ( 0,@xmath77 ) , however 500 rounds of oscillations are included inside . since @xmath139 ,",
    "the increase of @xmath2  will increase the ratio @xmath134 , therefore will also amplify the effect of @xmath4 . comparing cf6b with [ cf1]c ,",
    "the black curve is more severely suppressed , the red and blue are more severely pulled down .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on the spin - evolution of zero - polarized @xmath140rb condensates has been studied .",
    "the following points are summarized :          \\(iv ) _",
    "sensitivity_.  when @xmath60 is close to @xmath0 or @xmath2 , @xmath142  is highly sensitive to @xmath4 .",

    "one can see that @xmath4 causes oscillation in general .",

    "the amplitude will firstly increase with @xmath4 .",
    "however , when @xmath4 exceeds certain values , the amplitude decreases with @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath4 is sufficiently large , the amplitude will become so small that @xmath58 looks just like the horizontal line @xmath90 .",
    "this situation would occur if @xmath143 , and 2000 mg , respectively , when @xmath144 , and @xmath81 .",
    "it implies that the suppression of the amplitude is much easier to be fulfilled if @xmath145 or @xmath2 . on the other hand , in [ cf7]c with @xmath84",
