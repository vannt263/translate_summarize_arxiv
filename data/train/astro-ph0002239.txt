    "the example of ero  j164502 + 4626.4 illustrates the utility of break amplitudes for redshift identifications .",
    "the amplitude of the continuum break in ero  j164502 + 4626.4 is @xmath148 across an emission line at 9090.6  . were the emission line , the implied redshift would be @xmath159 .",
    "models and measurements of the strength of the  forest imply decrements @xmath160 at @xmath161 ( madau 1995 ; stern & spinrad 1999 ) , incompatible with the observed decrement and arguing for a lower redshift line identification .",
    "we report the serendipitous discovery of two faint galaxies with high equivalent width emission lines at long wavelength ( @xmath162  ) . for one source , galaxy b , faint blue continuum and a weak secondary line emission feature implies the source is at @xmath9 .",
    "the spatial proximity and similar emission wavelength of object a persuasively argues that this is an unusual -emitter at @xmath163 .",
    "it had been thought that serendipitous one - lined sources with rest - frame equivalent widths larger than a few @xmath164 100   are exclusively identified with high - redshift .",
    "our observations have shown that this is demonstrably not the case .",
    "both sources are unlike local star - forming galaxies , and we suggest that the observations are most consistent with the discovery of a moderate - redshift active system .    several programs are currently underway to find high - redshift emitters using a combination of narrow- and broad - band imaging ( thommes et  al .",
    "1998 ; hu et  al . 1998 ) and serendipitous long slit surveys ( manning et  al .",
    "the moderate - redshift system discussed herein has serious implications for those surveys .",
    "in particular we expect the line - emission surveys to uncover a population of strong line emitters and we emphasize that comparison of this sample with magnitude - limited surveys could be misleading .",
    "we discuss various criteria which can be used to assess whether a solitary , high - equivalent width emission feature is associated with high - redshift . in table  2",
    "we consider how recently reported @xmath21 spectroscopic candidates fare with respect to these criteria .",
    "some sources are reliably confirmed at @xmath19 , while others are confirmed at low - redshift and yet others remain ambiguous with the current data .",
    "we conclude that some criteria are necessary , but not sufficient , to conclude that a source is at @xmath19 , such as a continuum decrement across the emission feature , while other criteria are sufficient , but not necessary , such as an asymmetric line profile .",
    "we suggest that multiple criteria are necessary to convincingly demonstrate that a single - lined source is at high - redshift .",
