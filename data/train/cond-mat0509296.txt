    "the scattering of electrons with low energy spin excitations is responsible for the anomalous behaviour of many systems which are described as being strongly correlated . in magnetic impurity systems",
    "this scattering is enhanced leading to the kondo effect and the many - body resonance ( kondo resonance ) which develops at low temperatures at the fermi level .",
    "it is also the origin of the large mass enhancements in heavy fermion systems , and the strong renormalisation of the energy bands at the fermi level . at a quantum critical point , where the critical temperature for magnetic ordering is reduced to zero by pressure or alloying , it is the local low energy fluctuations which cause the breakdown of fermi liquid theory . in the cuprate high temperature superconductors , it is the scattering with the spin fluctuations , after the antiferromagnetic order has been destroyed through doping , which is the likely cause of the anomalous electronic behaviour in the normal state .",
    "the exchange of the magnetic fluctuations between the conduction electrons may be the origin of the electron attraction leading to superconductivity .",
    "it is important , therefore , to understand the nature of these fluctuations in the absence of any long range magnetic order . here , we study the spin dynamics in a strongly correlated local model , the impurity anderson model @xcite , and calculate local spin dynamics using a renormalised perturbation theory expansion .",
    "we start by describing the model and the technical aspects of the approach in this section of the paper , and later present results for various parameter regimes , both with and without an applied magnetic field .",
    "+ the anderson model has the form , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy of the impurity level , @xmath2 is the interaction at the impurity site , and @xmath3 the hybridization matrix element to a band of conduction electrons with energy @xmath4 . in the wide band limit",
    "the hybridization weighted density of states , @xmath5 , can be taken as a constant @xmath6 . with this assumption the impurity one - electron with spin @xmath7 green s function is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the self - energy .",
    "+ we have demonstrated in earlier work that the low energy fixed point of this model @xcite can be interpreted in terms of the same model but with renormalised parameters @xcite .",
    "the renormalised model takes the form , @xmath10 where the colon brackets indicate that the expression within them must be normal - ordered .",
    "the three parameters which specify this renormalised model are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , defined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the local 4-vertex .",
    "the renormalised hamiltonian ( [ rham ] ) describes only the low energy fixed point and the leading irrelevant corrections .",
    "a complete description of the original model can be obtained by working in the lagrangian formulation .",
    "the lagrangian of the original model @xmath18 can be rewritten in terms of the renormalised model plus counter - terms , @xmath19 where @xmath20 describes counter - terms . in this formulation",
    "a renormalised perturbation expansion can be carried out in terms of the quasiparticle propogaters in powers of the renormalised interaction @xmath13 .",
    "the role of the three parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the counter - term is to cancel any further renormalisation of the parameters , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are taken to be fully renormalised from the start @xcite .",
    "+ in terms of the renormalised parameters the exact results for the impurity spin and charge susceptibilities take a simple form , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is in units of @xmath26 , @xmath27 differs by a factor from the usual definition , so that for the non - interacting system , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the local density of states for the non - interacting quasiparticles , @xmath30    these results correspond to a first order calculation in the renormalized perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "+ we can choose to work solely in terms of the parameters , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and determine them by comparison with experiments , as one does in a phenomenological fermi liquid theory . to determine them in terms of the bare parameters of the orginal model using equation ( [ ren ] ) it would seem that we need almost the complete solution of the model , including the dynamics .",
    "however , they can be calculated without recourse to these formulae by fitting the low energy excitations of the numerical renormalisation group calculations to those of the effective low energy model given in equation ( [ rham ] ) , as was done essentially in the original nrg calculations @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , for various parameter regimes of the model have been described in earlier work @xcite .",

    "these scattering terms at @xmath35 have implicitly been taken into account in the results for the static susceptibilities in ( [ rsus ] ) , and so we must introduce the counter - term @xmath23 to prevent overcounting .",

    "these spectra can be calculated using the same methods which have been developed for calculating the spectral density of the one - electron impurity green s function .",

    "it might seem surprising that the quasiparticle contribution to the dynamic susceptibility does not have to be multiplied by a factor @xmath171 .",
    "the reason why such a factor is not required is because there is also a renormalisation of the vertex @xmath172 which couples the system to the external magnetic field .",
    "it can be shown via a ward identity that this vertex evaluated at @xmath173 is equal to @xmath174 @xcite and , as a consequence , on differentiating twice with respect to @xmath92 brings in a factor @xmath175 which cancels factors of @xmath15 from product of the full green s functions . as a result",
    "the @xmath15 does not appear in calculating the dynamical response functions from the rpt .",
    "the approach used here can be generalised to lattice models , such as the hubbard model and hubbard - holstein models , within the dynamical mean field theory , and these calculations are in progress .",
