    "open clusters are excellent targets to understand issues related to galactic structure , chemical composition , stellar population , dynamical evolution and star formation processes in the galaxy .",
    "the importance of photometric studies of star clusters lie in their colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) which allow us to estimate cluster s fundamental parameters such as age , distance and reddening . in this study",
    ", we consider two young open cluster , ngc 637 and ngc 957 , situated in perseus arm of milky way to estimate their fundamental parameters and mass function .",
    "* ngc 637 * = c0139@xmath10637 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12=@xmath10640224 ; @xmath13 = 12855 , @xmath14=173 ) is classified as a trumpler class i2 m by @xcite .",
    "using @xmath15 photographic data , @xcite found the cluster to be located in the perseus arm at a distance of 2.4 kpc .",
    "@xcite used the @xmath16 photoelectic photometry and derived a colour excess of @xmath17 mag and a distance of 2.5 kpc .",
    "recently , @xcite studied this cluster using @xmath16 ccd photometry and estimated a colour excess of @xmath18 mag .",
    "further , using cmd and assuming a total - to - selective absorption ( @xmath19 ) of 3.1 , they derived a distance of 2.75 kpc .",
    "* ngc 957 * = c0230@xmath10573 ( @xmath20 , @xmath12=573336 ; @xmath13=13628 , @xmath14=@xmath21265 ) is located in the perseus spiral arm of our galaxy and according to @xcite , it is of type iii 2p .",
    "this cluster was studied by @xcite using @xmath15 photographic photometry and they found that this is an young star cluster situated at a distance of 1.8 kpc .",
    "this cluster was further investigated by @xcite using johnson @xmath16 photoelectric and photographic photometry .",
    "he derived reddening of @xmath22 mag , distance of 2.1 kpc and age of about 4 myr .    in the present study",
    ", we provide deep @xmath0 ccd photometry of ngc 637 and ngc 957 , and re - visit their basic parameters and estimate their luminosity and mass functions .",
    "both the clusters are poorly studied in the literature . for ngc 957 ,",
    "ccd photometric observations is presented for the first time alongwith spectroscopic observations of a few brightest members of both the clusters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the observations and data reductions in  [ sec : obs ] , while in  [ sec : ana ] , we describe the data analysis . ",
    "[ sec : mfu ] and  [ sec : mse ] describe about the mass function and mass segregation .",
    "finally ,  [ sec : con ] contains the conclusions of our study .",
    "johnson @xmath16 and cousins @xmath23 ccd photometric observations were obtained using 104-cm sampurnanand telescope at nainital on 13 november 2004 for ngc 637 and on 28 september 2006 for ngc 957 .",
    "data were recorded using a liquid nitrogen cooled 2k@xmath242k ccd of 24@xmath25 m square size pixel , which results in a scale of 036 per pixel and a square field of 127 in the sky on a side .",
    "the ccd has a gain of 10 electrons per analog - to - digital unit and a read out noise of 5.3 electrons . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "all the observations were taken in @xmath26 binning mode .",
    "log of observations are given in table 1 . in @xmath27 and @xmath28 filters , we also observed field regions situated about 15north from the cluster center of both ngc 637 and ngc 957 .",
    "identification maps of cluster and field regions are shown in fig .",
    "1 .    .log of observations , with dates and exposure times for each passband .",
    "@xmath29 denotes the number of stars measured in different passband . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : cf ]    there are many mf studies available in the literature using open star clusters in the milky way .",
    "recently , @xcite studied 5 young open star clusters and found that stellar mass spectra of these clusters are well represented with a power law very similar to salpeter value within the uncertainties .",
    "mf study of @xcite using a sample of seven star clusters also conclude the salpeter type mf slope in these clusters .",
    "these studies alongwith the others @xcite found their results consistent with the salpeter value .",
    "in order to study the mass segregation effect in the clusters , we plot the cumulative radial stellar distribution of stars for different masses in fig  [ fig : mseg ] and mass segregation effect is seen for both the clusters , meaning , higher - mass stars gradually sink towards the cluster center than the lower mass stars .",
    "further , we performed k - s test to see the statistical significance of mass segregation .",
    "for ngc 637 , we divided the ms stars in three magnitude range i.e. @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 corresponding to the mass range of @xmath33 and 1.2@xmath34 m / m@xmath35@xmath360.8 . for ngc 957 ,",
    "the magnitude range are @xmath37 and @xmath38 corresponding to the mass range of @xmath39 ,  @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the k - s test shows the mass segregation effect at confidence level of 99% for ngc 637 and 70% for ngc 957 .",
    "mass segregation effect can be due to dynamical evolution or imprint of star formation or both . in the lifetime of star clusters , encounters between its member stars gradually lead to an increased degree of energy equipartition throughout the clusters . in this process",
    "the higher mass cluster members gradually sink towards the cluster center and transfer their kinetic energy to the more numerous lower - mass stellar component , thus leading to mass segregation . the time scale on which a cluster will have lost all traces of its initial conditions is well represented by its relaxation time @xmath42 , which is given by    @xmath43    where @xmath29 is the number of cluster members ,",
    "@xmath44 is the half - mass radius of the cluster and @xmath45 is the mean mass of the cluster stars @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath44 has been assumed as half of the cluster radius derived by us . using the above relation we estimated the dynamical relaxation time @xmath46 10 myr for ngc 637 and ngc 957 .",
    "this indicates that the age of both clusters is same as its relaxation age .",
    "therefore , we conclude that both the clusters are dynamically relaxed .",
    "we studied two open star clusters ngc 637 and ngc 957 using @xmath0 ccd and 2mass @xmath47 data .",
    "results obtained in the analysis are the following .    1 .",
    "the radii of the clusters are obtained as 42 and 43 which corresponds to 3.0 and 2.8 pc respectively at the distance of the clusters ngc 637 and ngc 957 .",
    "2 .   from the two colour diagram",
    ", we estimated @xmath48 mag for ngc 637 and @xmath490.05 mag for ngc 957 .",
    "the @xmath47 data in combination with the optical data provide @xmath500.20 mag and 0.23@xmath510.20 mag while @xmath520.20 mag and @xmath530.20 mag for ngc 637 and ngc 957 respectively .",
    "analysis indicates that interstellar extinction law is normal towards the direction of both the clusters .",
    "distances to the cluster ngc 637 and ngc 957 are determined as 2.5@xmath510.2 and 2.2@xmath510.2 kpc respectively .",
    "these distances are supported by the distance values derived using optical and near - ir data .",
    "an age of 10@xmath515 myr is determined for both ngc 637 and ngc 957 by comparing the isochrones of @xmath54 0.02 given by @xcite .",
    "we discovered one emission type star in ngc 637 .",
    "two emission type stars in ngc 957 are also confirmed by the present study .",
    "these are classical be star candidates .",
    "the two emission stars in ngc 957 are about to leave the ms while the emission star in ngc 637 is in the ms evolutionary phase .",
    "the mass function slopes @xmath55 and @xmath9 are derived for ngc 637 and ngc 957 by considering the corrections of field star contamination and data incompleteness . our analysis indicate that both the cluster are dynamically relaxed and one plausible reason of this relaxation may be the dynamical evolution of the clusters .",
