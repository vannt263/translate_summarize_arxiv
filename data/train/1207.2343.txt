    "the interaction of a quantum system with its environment causes the dynamics to be non - unitary : the evolution of the state of the open quantum system can no longer be described by the schrdinger equation but a master equation is needed in order to characterize dissipation and decoherence effects . since merely all realistic quantum systems are open , i.e. , they are influenced by their surroundings , the description of such dynamics is crucial for our understanding of the nature .",
    "therefore , the fundamental issues of open quantum systems as well as their mathematical description have gained a large amount of interest in the recent years @xcite .",
    "the standard approach to the dynamics of open quantum systems , which employs the concept of a quantum markov process , was developed already in the seventies @xcite and has been successfully applied in modeling many quantum systems @xcite . for a quantum markov process the dynamics is given by a semigroup of completely positive dynamical maps and the corresponding master equation describing the dynamics is in the lindblad form .",
    "the simple structure of the master equation allows a straightforward treatment of the dynamics of the open system whenever memory effects play no role in the dynamics .",
    "however , for many processes occurring in the nature the approximations allowing the markovian treatment are not valid .",
    "for example , strong system - environment coupling , structured or finite reservoirs and low temperatures can give rise to pronounced memory effects in the dynamics of the open system and these systems require a more sophisticated non - markovian treatment .",
    "the increasingly important role of non - markovian processes has initiated significant steps towards a general consistent theory of non - markovian quantum dynamics @xcite as well as achievements in the experimental detection and control of memory effects @xcite .",
    "the vast interest in memory effects in quantum processes has led into many mathematical formulations of the dynamics beyond the markov theory as well as a large variety of tools for solving the dynamics .",
    "probably the most common ones of these methods apply memory kernel master equations @xcite or local in time master equations @xcite .",
    "the local in time master equations give a mathematically rather simple method for dealing with memory effects and they have been applied to describe a variety of non - markovian processes in nature @xcite . despite the simple form , there are still many misunderstandings related to the physical applicability and interpretations of these equations . here",
    "we pinpoint and clarify some of these misbeliefs about the local in time description and give some illustrative examples to further explain these points .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ ch2 ]",
    "we introduce the formulation of non - markovian dynamics in terms of local - in - time master equations and specify the connection between the quantum and classical cases .",
    "we further connect the local in time equation to a quantum jump description @xcite , allowing an interpretation for negative decay rates in the equation .",
    "in section [ ch3 ] we discuss three different points regarding the local in time description , which are often misunderstood , and give some illustrative examples to rebut these misbeliefs .",
    "section [ ch4 ] introduces a description of a classical non - markov chain , where memory effects play a crucial role .",
    "for a markovian quantum process the dynamics is given by a semigroup of completely positive dynamical maps and the corresponding master equation for the reduced density matrix @xmath0 describing the dynamics is in the lindblad form @xmath1+\\sum_i \\gamma_i \\left(l_i\\rho(t)l_i^\\dagger-\\frac{1}{2}\\{l_i^\\dagger l_i,\\rho(t)\\}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a hermitian operator , @xmath3 are the decay rates , which are positive constants , and @xmath4 are the lindblad operators .",
    "the standard approach to the non - markovian dynamics of open systems uses the nakajima - zwanzig projection operator technique @xcite from which one obtains the memory kernel master equation @xmath5 in which quantum memory effects are taken into account through the introduction of the memory kernel @xmath6 . since the master equation is not local in time due to the integration over the density matrix @xmath7 , it is usually taken as granted that a master equation of this form guarantees the occurrence of memory effects in the dynamics .",
    "however , the form of a master equation is not in general unique , i.e. , the dynamics can be described equivalently by another type of master equation , which is local in time @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it was shown in @xcite , that under fairly general assumptions , the master equation of the form of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) can always be cast into a local in time form @xmath8 in which no memory kernel occurs .",
    "further , any time - local master equation can be cast in a lindblad - like form of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , but with time dependent lindblad operators as well as time dependent decay rates @xmath9 which may also become negative for some intervals of time @xcite .",
    "thus , non - markovian dynamics can be written in the local in time form @xmath10 \\label{eq3 } \\\\ & & + \\sum_i \\gamma_i(t ) \\left(l_i(t)\\rho(t)l_i^\\dagger(t)-\\frac{1}{2}\\{l_i^\\dagger(t ) l_i(t),\\rho(t)\\}\\right),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with temporarily negative decay rates @xmath9 .",
    "master equations of this form have been frequently applied in the context of non - markovian systems , but there are still some misunderstandings related to their applicability . before going into details of these common misunderstandings in section [ ch3 ]",
    "let us first introduce some aspects related to these equations , which will allow us to explain our arguments in the following sections .",
    "the master equation ( [ eq3 ] ) describes a general quantum process , which reduces to a standard quantum markov process whenever the decay rates @xmath9 are positive constants and the lindblad operators are independent of time . also , as a special case",
    ", one can obtain the classical rate equation under certain assumptions as we will show here .",
    "let us first assume that the hamiltonian of the system is time - independent and it has the spectral decomposition @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the eigenenergies and @xmath13 the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian .",
    "now assume , that the system is described by a classical probability distribution instead of the quantum mechanical density matrix , i.e. , the density matrix can be written as a diagonal matrix in the system eigenbasis @xmath14 , where @xmath15 gives the occupation probability of the eigenstate @xmath13 at time @xmath16 .",
    "now , if we assume , that the lindblad operators @xmath4 in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) describe transitions from one eigenstate to another @xmath17 such that @xmath18 we obtain @xmath19\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{k}\\sum_{l\\neq k } \\gamma_{kl}(t ) \\left(l_{kl}\\rho(t)l_{kl}^\\dagger-\\frac{1}{2}\\{l_{kl}^\\dagger l_{kl},\\rho(t)\\}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{k}\\sum_{l\\neq k } \\gamma_{kl}(t)\\left(p_l(t)\\ket{\\psi_k}\\bra{\\psi_k}-p_l(t)\\ket{\\psi_l}\\bra{\\psi_l}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{k}\\ket{\\psi_k}\\bra{\\psi_k } \\sum_{l\\neq k } \\left(\\gamma_{kl}(t)p_l(t)-\\gamma_{lk}(t)p_k(t)\\right),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which one obtains the rate equation @xmath20 which can also be cast into a more compact form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the column vector with elements @xmath15 and @xmath23 is a matrix with elements @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26.whenever the decay rates are positive constants equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq4b ] ) describe the well known continuous in time markov chain .",
    "however , if the decay rates can be temporarily negative these equations no longer describe a markov chain but rather a classical non - markovian process . in the following chapters we will study further such classical non - markovian processes as well as clarify the interpretation of negative rates in the classical realm . before that , let us study more the interpretation of negative decay rates in the quantum case .",
    "the state of a quantum system is described by a density matrix , which can also be seen as an ensemble of state vectors each of them having a classical probability of appearance .",
    "this view has given the starting point for the development of monte carlo simulation methods for markovian @xcite and non - markovian @xcite open quantum systems in which the time evolution of each state vector in the ensemble contains a stochastic element .",
    "one of these methods for markovian dynamics is the monte carlo wave function ( mcwf ) method which exploits quantum jumps @xcite .",
    "the mcwf quantum jump method is probably the most commonly used monte carlo method for treating markovian open systems whose dynamics is governed by the master equation in the lindblad form of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) . to unravel the master equation ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "one has to generate an ensemble of stochastic state vector realizations whose deterministic and continuous time evolution is interrupted by randomly occurring quantum jumps .",
    "the average over the ensemble of stochastic realizations gives the reduced system at any given moment of time .",
    "one can write the density matrix in terms of the ensemble of state vectors as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of ensemble members in the state @xmath29 at time @xmath16 and @xmath30 is the total ensemble size .",
    "the method proceeds in discrete time steps @xmath31 and a single time step that takes us from time @xmath16 to @xmath32 . during the time step ,",
    "a given state vector @xmath29 evolves either in a deterministic way or performs a randomly occurring quantum jump .",
    "the deterministic evolution is given by the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian @xmath33 where the operators are the hermitian operator @xmath2 and the lindblad operators @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the deterministic time - evolution by the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) gives for a single time step the state @xmath34 after which the state is renormalized .",
    "if , on the other hand , a quantum jump to channel @xmath35 occurs , the state vector changes in a discontinuous way @xmath36 the probability @xmath37 for a state vector @xmath38 to have a quantum jump to channel @xmath35 is given by @xmath39    now , let us consider the non - markovian case . for simplicity , we assume the lindblad operators in the local in time master equation ( [ eq3 ] ) to be time - independent . the difference to equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is that the time dependent decay rates get temporarily negative values .",
    "one can directly see from equation ( [ eq9 ] ) that whenever the decay rate is negative one can not apply the mcwf quantum jump method , since one would end up with negative jump probabilities .",
    "however it is possible to develop another jump description for the non - markovian case , inherently different from the markovian one @xcite .",
    "the deterministic evolution is equivalent to the markovian case , i.e. given by equations ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) @xcite .",
    "also , whenever the decay rate in channel @xmath35 is positive the corresponding jump can be produced as the markovian one .",
    "however , when the decay rate in channel @xmath35 turns negative , memory effects start to play a role and the jump method described in equations ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) can no longer be used .",
    "indeed , for a negative channel @xmath35 the direction of the jump process gets reversed @xmath40 and the jump operator for the negative channel @xmath35 takes the form @xmath41 where the source state of the jump is @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the source and the target states of the jump get swapped as the decay rate becomes negative .",
    "further the probability for a reversed jump for a given state vector @xmath38 is given by @xmath43 note that if there are no ensemble members in the target state , @xmath44 , the jump probability is equal to zero .",
    "the local in time equations of the form given in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) with temporarily negative decay rates give a natural extension of the markovian equation ( [ eq1 ] ) to the non - markovian regime .",
    "the negative decay rates arise naturally , when no markov approximation is made in the microscopic derivation of the master equation .",
    "they have been widely applied to non - markovian problems in physics , but there are still many misunderstandings related to the applicability and interpretation of these equations . in this section",
    "we pinpoint some of these misunderstandings and through some simple examples clarify these points .",
    "a naturally arising question is whether the dynamics remains physical when the markovian master equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is extended to the non - markovian regime where temporarily negative decay rates arise .",
    "the physicality of the process refers to the question of whether the master equation produces physical states , when the input state is physical . in the quantum realm",
    "this boils down to the question , whether the resulting dynamical map is completely positive for each time @xmath16 .",
    "the complete positivity of the dynamical map is a more strict requirement than the positivity of the output state , i.e. , whenever the map is completely positive the output states must be positive as well .",
    "it is well known , that the markovian master equation ( [ eq1 ] ) produces completely positive dynamical maps for all times .",
    "however this requires the positivity of the decay rates . when the decay rates are temporarily negative there exists no general proof , that the resulting maps would be completely positive",
    ". however , if further assumptions on the properties of the decay rates are made , the requirement of complete positivity is met . in order to further illustrate this statement",
    "let us consider a simple example of a two - level system with a single channel .",
    "the general master equation for a single channel process of a two - level system with the lindblad operator @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a system basis , is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an arbitrary function with temporarily negative values . for simplicity",
    "we take the system hamiltonian @xmath49 .",
    "equation ( [ eq11 ] ) can be easily solved to give the dynamical maps describing the process for time @xmath16 @xmath50 where @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "one can proof that the dynamical maps for different times @xmath16 given by equation ( [ eq12 ] ) are completely positive if and only if @xmath52 for all times @xmath16 .",
    "thus in order for the master equation ( [ eq11 ] ) to describe a physical process , the decay rate @xmath48 needs not to be positive but only it s integral has to be .",
    "therefore , in general , master equations with negative decay rates do produce physical processes , when certain additional constraints are met .      in the previous section we demonstrated , that negative decay rates in a time local master equation can produce completely positive dynamical maps , i.e. , that they do describe physical processes .",
    "a natural question arising is , how to interpret the negative decay rates .",
    "for the markovian case , with positive rates , the interpretation is straightforward when one follows the line of thought of the jump unraveling of section [ ch22 ] ; the decay rate gives the rate at which jumps from the source state to the target state of the corresponding channel occur and thus the jump probabilities given in equation ( [ eq9 ] ) are directly proportional to decay rate .    a misunderstanding regarding the interpretation of the negative decay rates occurs , when one tries to use the markovian logic in the non - markovian case : one quite easily makes the false conclusion , that the negative decay rate only reverses the direction of the process between the state vectors .",
    "however , one can quite easily figure out , that this is not enough : in the non - markovain jump unraveling of section [ ch22 ] the direction of the process is reversed , but also the jump probabilities are different : as we can see in equation ( [ eq10 ] ) , the jump probability is not only proportional to the absolute value of the decay rate , but also to the ratio of the occupation numbers @xmath53 given by the state of the system at the time of the jump .",
    "in particular , the jump probability is proportional to the occupation number of the target state , which carries information about the state of the system at previous times .",
    "thus , whenever the decay rate is negative one can define an effective rate for the reversed jumps given by @xmath54 which depends on the state the system at time @xmath16 and therefore also on the earlier states of the system .",
    "the simple reversal of the jump process , without changing the jump probabilities would naturally not produce a non - markovian process .",
    "the effective decay rates in equation ( [ eq13 ] ) however encode the history of the process and thus allow memory effects in the dynamics . in the following section we will discuss memory effects described by local in time equations in detail , but first we will explore the concept of effective decay rates in the classical case .",
    "assume we have a classical stochastic process described by the rate equation ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "when the rates @xmath55 are positive , the terms with a positive sign represent probability gain to the state @xmath56 and the terms with a negative sign represent loss .",
    "let us now consider a gain term @xmath57 and assume @xmath58 .",
    "now , the term can be rewritten @xmath59 and we see that the gain term with the negative rate @xmath55 actually describes a loss term with an effective positive rate @xmath60 .",
    "thus , also in the classical case , the negative decay rate describes a reversed process with an effective decay rate , which depends also on the earlier states of the system .",
    "the fact that equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is local in time ,",
    "i.e. , there is no integration over the past states of the system in the master equation often creates a misunderstanding that the equation can not describe memory effects .",
    "however , the classical counterpart of the equation immediately shows that this is not the case whenever there are negative decay rates : the rate equation with positive rates is a straightforward consequence of the markov property .",
    "thus , whenever one can not write a rate equation with positive rates for the process , it can not fulfill the markov condition .",
    "therefore , the process must be non - markovian .",
    "the classical case acts as a simple demonstration of the fact that local in time equations with negative decay rates indeed describe memory effects .    to further demonstrate the memory effects induced by negative decay rates ,",
    "let us study a simple example of a two - state system and compare the probability flow in the non - markovian and corresponding markovian cases .",
    "we denote the probability to be on state @xmath61 at time @xmath16 by @xmath62 .",
    "let us first study a markovian model , where the rate equations are @xmath63 and the decay rates are @xmath64 this is a process , where the direction of the probability flow changes periodically due to two alternating channels with opposite direction , but there are no memory effects .",
    "the corresponding process with memory effects has only one decay rate @xmath48 for the transitions @xmath65 with a negative region for @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , for the period of time with the negative decay rate we can rewrite the equation in terms of an effective decay rate , which in this case is @xmath68 and the rate equation reads @xmath69 in figure [ fig1 ] we have plotted @xmath70 for both the processes as well as the effective decay rate @xmath71 for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we can see a substantial qualitative difference in the markovian and non - markovian cases .",
    "naturally both the processes coincide for @xmath75 . in this region",
    "the different initial values start to approach a stationary value independent of the initial state . for @xmath76 ,",
    "the negative decay rate occurs for the non - markovian process and the two processes diverge from each other .",
    "for the markovian process probability distributions corresponding to different initial values still approach each other , since the decay rate is independent of the initial state . for the non - markovian process , the effective decay rate @xmath71 depends on the earlier states of the system and therefore the different probability distributions , corresponding to different initial states , diverge from each other when the decay rate is negative and signify the presence of memory effects . in the non - markovian case the evolution for @xmath77 is a reflection of the history of the state : the system starts approaching the initial state by reversing the process which occurred in the past .",
    "in contrast , for the corresponding markovian process the system does not account for the past but continues to approach a common stationary value independent of the initial state .",
    "the most striking difference between the two processes can be seen , when the initial state is chosen to be @xmath78 . for this initial value , in the markovian case",
    "@xmath70 starts increasing .",
    "however , for the non - markovian process @xmath79 for all times @xmath16 , since the effective decay rate is zero for all times ; one can not reverse jumps that never occurred . in the next section",
    "we further explore different characteristics of classical non - markovian processes described by local in time equations .",
    "markovian ( m ) and non - markovian ( nm ) two state model for different initial states @xmath80 and for @xmath72 .",
    "the upper panel describes state of the system as a function of time .",
    "solid lines are for the markovian and markers for the non - markovian model . in the lower panel",
    "we plot the time dependent rates for the markovian model ( dashed and dotted lines ) , the positive rate for the non - markovian model ( dotted line ) and the effective rate for the non - markovian model ( markers ) . color and marker coding matches to upper panel .",

    "a finite continuous time markov chain is a process @xmath81 with values in @xmath82 , such that given the present , the past and future are independent , i.e. , for all @xmath83 and all states @xmath84 the markov condition @xcite @xmath85 is fullfilled .",
    "the markov property of equation ( [ eq14 ] ) guarantees , that such a process is described by a rate equation ( [ eq4 ] ) , where all the rates @xmath55 are positive .",
    "a straightforward generalization of such a process to the non - markovian regime can be made by allowing the rates to get temporarily negative values . naturally , in this case , the condition of equation ( [ eq14 ] ) is no longer fulfilled . to see some characteristic features of such processes ,",

    "the dynamics conserves the positivity , which is easy to check , e.g. , by exploiting the change of variable @xmath95 p_i(t)$ ] .",

    "also , as we can see in figure [ fig4 ] , the non - markovian process reaches the stationary state .",
    "this is due to two competing processes present in the non - markovian case : the constantly positive rate drives the system towards the stationary state and the oscillatory rate tries to bring the system towards the initial state .",

    "the constantly positive rate drives the effective rates towards the corresponding markovian value . at later times",

    "as the need for engineering and controlling open quantum system for quantum information applications has increased in the recent years , efficient methods for treating non - markovian dynamics are required .",
    "the local in time description of non - markovian dynamics with efficient simulation methods allows a relatively simple treatment for memory effects . even though the local in time description has been introduced",
    "already more than thirty years ago and successfully applied to many non - markovian problems , nevertheless there has been many misunderstandings related to the applicability of these equations .    in this paper",

    "we have also considered classical stochastic processes , which can be derived as a special case of the quantum master equation .",
    "we showed that negative decay rates in the master equation do not prevent the complete positivity of the corresponding dynamical map .",
    "further , we demonstrated that the negative decay rates do not only describe a reversal of a process but , also affect the transition probabilities in the process reflected in effective decay rates describing the dynamics.we compared the two cases with positive and negative rates in order to emphasize that local in time equations with negative rates describe memory effects .",

    "<S> non - markovian local in time master equations give a relatively simple way to describe the dynamics of open quantum systems with memory effects . despite their simple form , there are still many misunderstandings related to the physical applicability and interpretation of these equations . here </S>",
    "<S> we clarify these issues both in the case of quantum and classical master equations . </S>",
    "<S> we further introduce the concept of a classical non - markov chain signified through negative jump rates in the chain configuration . </S>"
