    "from deep mmt / hectospec spectroscopy to @xmath8 magnitude @xmath9 , @xcite and @xcite have serendipitously discovered a relative strengthening of ultraviolet fe  ii emission for quasars ( @xmath10 ) in a 2 deg@xmath11 `` pencil - beam '' field that intersects two large quasar groups ( lqgs ) , u1.11 and u1.28 @xcite , and a `` doubtful lqg '' , u1.54 .",
    "that work suggests that strong / ultrastrong uv fe ii emitters appear to be more strongly represented in dense quasar environments , and that ( clowes & harris , unpublished visualisation ) they appear to clump with other quasars or with themselves",
    ". such effects , if confirmed , would be important for our understanding of the origin of the problematic uv fe  ii emission , the influence on it of large- and small - scale environments , and of the evolution of cosmological structures . in this paper , using sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) spectroscopy , we test whether the above effects are observed when a large sample of lqgs is considered",
    ". the pencil - beam study has deep spectroscopy but , of course , narrow - angle coverage . here",
    ", with less - deep sdss spectroscopy , we can consider all of these lqgs in their entirety .",
    "we first discuss the statistical properties of the uv fe  ii for lqgs in general .",
    "we then focus further on these three lqgs u1.11 , u1.28 , u1.54 together with the `` huge - lqg '' , u1.27 , of @xcite .",
    "large quasar groups are the largest structures seen in the early universe , with sizes @xmath6 70500 mpc and memberships of @xmath6 5 - 70 quasars .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite , and earlier references given there , for more details on lqgs .",
    "the `` doubtful lqg '' u1.54 is a candidate lqg that failed the test of significance described in @xcite , but which had been identified once before as a candidate lqg in an independent survey @xcite .",
    "sometimes , though , for simplicity we shall refer to this doubtful lqg just as an lqg .",
    "partly , we retain some interest in u1.54 because it and u1.11 and u1.28 are all aligned along the line of sight .",
    "the huge - lqg ( u1.27 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the largest structure currently known in the early universe .",
    "u1.28 , also known as the clowes & campusano lqg , ( cclqg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was previously the largest .",
    "( in this labelling of the lqgs , `` u '' refers to a connected unit , and the appended number gives the mean redshift of its members . )",
    "iron ( fe ) in the optical and ultraviolet regions of quasar and agn spectra is very common , but its occurrence in the uv at the `` ultrastrong '' level is rare .",
    "a good example of an ultrastrong , uv fe  ii emitting quasar is that of @xcite , quasar 2226@xmath123905 . the total number of such ultrastrong quasars known used to be very small , but it has now increased because of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )  for example , @xcite , and our own work . the fractional rate of occurrence remains small , however : we estimate that for redshifts in the range 1.01.8 , only @xmath6 6.6 per cent of all quasars are ultrastrong emitters .",
    "( incidentally , we classify 88 per cent of the high - grade optical and/or uv fe  ii emitters with @xmath13 and @xmath14 from @xcite as strong or ultrastrong uv emitters , and conversely we find a substantially larger total . )    following @xcite , we use the rest - frame `` @xmath1 '' equivalent width , defined between two continuum - windows 22402255 and 26652695   as the index of uv fe  ii emission .",
    "based on the median @xmath1 @xmath6 30    for all quasars ( non - bal and bal ) from table  2 of @xcite we define @xcite , as an illustrative guide , `` strong emitters '' as those with @xmath15    and `` ultrastrong '' as those with @xmath4   .",
    "note , however ( see further discussion below ) that the sample of @xmath1 values from @xcite seems to have substantially different properties from ours .",
    "the cause of ultrastrong , uv fe  ii emission has not been successfully attributed to any one mechanism , and probably the reality is that several mechanisms contribute , particularly iron abundance , ly-@xmath7 fluorescence , and microturbulence .",
    "@xcite gives a short but detailed review of the current state of understanding .",
    "a very brief summary follows .",
    "the fe  ii is often attributed to the broad line region ( blr ) , but there is evidence that it might instead arise from an intermediate line region ( ilr ) , between the outer blr and the inner torus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the early days of trying to understand the fe  ii emission",
    ", @xcite and @xcite concluded that either there was an unusually high abundance of iron or an important mechanism was being overlooked .",
    "abundance is important , but not likely to be dominant @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that ly@xmath7 fluorescence might be the overlooked mechanism , with observational and theoretical support following from @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "a further important mechanism is microturbulence of @xmath16 km  s@xmath17 @xcite , which increases the spread in wavelength of fe  ii absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus increases radiative pumping . strong and ultrastrong fe  ii emission might be associated with some special environmental circumstances influencing the quasars .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find that there is a systematic shift by @xmath6 9    of the @xmath1 equivalent widths to higher values for the 2 deg@xmath11 pencil - beam field that intersects the lqgs u1.11 , u1.28 and u1.54 compared with a combined set of 13 2-deg@xmath11 control fields elsewhere .",
    "there is then an unusually high rate of occurrence of strong and ultrastrong fe  ii emitters .",
    "these strong and ultrastrong emitters appear to clump with other quasars or with themselves ( clowes & harris , unpublished visualisation ) .    from the work of @xcite and",
    "@xcite it therefore appears that strong and ultrastrong uv fe  ii emitters might preferentially occur where the density of quasars is high , as it is in lqgs . in the case of the pencil - beam field",
    "there can be ambiguity about membership of the lqgs by the mmt / hectospec quasars since they are mostly fainter than the @xmath13 quasars from which the lqgs were discovered .",
    "the fainter quasars are considered provisionally to be new members primarily if they fall within the convex hull ( of member spheres , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the existing members .",
    "even so , some are outside the lqgs , although they do still clump  with each other  to form high - density regions .",
    "it is possible that these quasars that are outside the lqgs would , with a fainter , wide - angle survey prove to be members too , but with the data currently available there is no way of knowing .",
    "it is also possible that the lqg environment itself is not crucial , but that the lqgs are functioning as _ providers _ of the high ( quasar ) density environments that favour the fe ii emission .",
    "the alignment of these lqgs along the line of sight would then presumably have made the environmental effect prominent and allowed its discovery .",
    "of 14 strong / ultrastrong quasars in the pencil - beam field , that satisfy the imposed signal - to - noise ( s / n ) criterion , four are known lqg members ( all necessarily from sdss , but one has also been observed with mmt / hectospec ) , five are provisional new members ( i.e.  they fall within the convex hulls of the lqgs ) , and five are non - members ( all mmt / hectospec ) . the one quasar that fails the s / n criterion would be a non - member ( from sdss ) .    in this paper",
    "we first examine the statistical properties of @xmath1 emission for all of the lqgs with @xmath0 that we have identified in the dr7qso catalogue @xcite for quasars with @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "this allows us to investigate with a much larger sample than that of @xcite and @xcite the @xmath1 properties of lqg members compared with non - members  that is , of quasars that are known to be in dense ( quasar ) environments compared with those that are not known to be in dense environments .",
    "we apply the condition @xmath0 to minimise any `` edge effects '' of incomplete membership of the lqgs .",
    "we next investigate the distribution of the nearest - neighbour separations of the strongest emitters in the lqgs compared with the weaker emitters in the lqgs .",
    "finally , we focus further on the three lqgs u1.11 , u1.28 and u1.54 , together with the huge - lqg , u1.27 .",
    "we consider here all of the members of these lqgs rather than only those intersected by the pencil - beam .",
    "the sdss spectroscopy for these lqgs is , of course , not so deep as the mmt / hectospec spectroscopy of the pencil - beam , but the net outcome is nevertheless a useful increase in the size of the strong / ultrastrong sample .",
    "the lqgs have been discovered in the dr7qso catalogue @xcite using the procedure described fully in @xcite and summarised briefly in @xcite .",
    "essentially , the procedure involves application of a linkage algorithm followed by a test of statistical significance , the chms significance ( where chms stands for convex hull of member spheres  see * ? ? ?",
    "we restrict the dr7qso quasars to @xmath13 to ensure satisfactory spatial uniformity on the sky , since they are then predominantly from the low - redshift strand of selection @xcite .",
    "we have selected lqg candidates from quasars within the redshift range @xmath14 , but for this work we apply the condition @xmath0 to minimise any edge effects of incomplete membership .",
    "that is , the lqgs are restricted to @xmath18 but the quasars within them are contained by @xmath19 .",
    "we consider here lqgs with chms - significance @xmath20 and number of member quasars @xmath21 .",
    "the choice of @xmath22 is such that contamination by spurious lqg candidates should be negligible .",
    "this selection gives 134 lqgs with @xmath14 , incorporating 3092 quasars in total .",
    "the smallest membership is 11 and the largest 73 ( u1.27 , the huge - lqg ) .",
    "the lqgs are found from within a total of 27991 quasars .",
    "lqg members are thus only @xmath6 11 per cent of the total number of quasars . with the further condition",
    "@xmath0 we have 111 lqgs , incorporating 2629 quasars in total .",
    "again , the smallest membership is 11 and the largest 73 .",
    "details of the lqgs will be published in a catalogue paper ( clowes , in preparation ) .    as mentioned above , the doubtful lqg , u1.54",
    ", is not formally a lqg since it fails the test of chms - significance .",
    "it is therefore not one of the above 134 / 111 lqgs that do pass the test .",
    "however , as mentioned above , we retain some interest in u1.54 because it has been identified before as a candidate lqg and because it , u1.11 and u1.28 are all aligned along the line of sight . also , its chms - significance is conservative , and , in the case of curved morphology such as u1.54 has",
    ", there is therefore the possibility of a candidate lqg being more interesting than is immediately apparent .",
    "we shall focus further on the three lqgs u1.11 , u1.28 and u1.54 , together with the huge - lqg , u1.27 .",
    "these are the lqgs that have so far been investigated in most detail .",

    "the member quasars of the lqgs all have @xmath13 and all are in the redshift range @xmath14 .",
    "recall that to minimise edge effects we are applying the condition @xmath0 .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width @xmath1 , as described by @xcite , has been measured by software written for the purpose .",
    "it has been applied to all of the dr7qso quasars with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , after smoothing with a 5-pixel median filter .",
    "the median filter is used for the following reason .",
    "the principal source of error in the @xmath1 measurements seems likely to be the setting of the continuum , given the quite narrow windows of the weymann method  15 and 30   in the rest frame for the two continuum - windows of 22402255 and 26652695   .",
    "we have attempted an estimate of the measurement error by comparing the @xmath1 values arising from the unsmoothed sdss spectra with those arising from smoothing ( in the observed frame ) with both a 5-pixel ( as used in the actual processing ) and a 9-pixel median filter .",
    "the standard deviation of the difference between them is @xmath6 3.5 and 3.7   respectively .",
    "the @xmath1 feature itself is so wide that the smoothing of it by the median filter should have a relatively minor effect .",
    "we can therefore adopt @xmath6 3.53.7    as an indicative error associated with the @xmath1 measurements .",
    "we chose to apply the 5-pixel median filter routinely for this purpose of setting the continuum levels more reliably .",
    "( the 9-pixel median , however , would increase the effective width of the lower continuum window in particular more than we would wish . )",
    "the median filter also acts to reduce the residual [ o  i ] @xmath255577    sky feature , for those spectra in which it is present . in most cases ,",
    "where present , its effect on @xmath1 is smaller than the indicative errors .",
    "we can also assume that its occurrence in the lqg sample is identical to that in the matched control sample ( see below and the following section ) .",
    "approximately 1 per cent of the measurements of @xmath1 by the software are negative .",
    "usually , this happens because the spectra are increasing strongly to the blue , and are therefore concave , leading to negative @xmath1 values , given the rigorous application of the @xmath1 definition .",
    "occasionally , absorption or artefacts in the spectra can also lead to negative values .",
    "the 3092 lqg members ( @xmath14 ) have been extracted from the entire catalogue to form the lqg sample .",
    "the remainder  24899 non - lqg - members  of the catalogue is then used as the control sample for comparison .",
    "the percentage occurrences of negative @xmath1 are very similar for both the lqg sample and the control sample , and so negative @xmath1 values have simply been removed , leading to final samples of 3063 and 24604 respectively .",
    "also , one of the 166 members of u1.11 , u1.28 , u1.54 and u1.27 has negative @xmath1 .    for the final control sample ,",
    "the mean and median @xmath1 values are 26.3 and 25.0    respectively and the standard deviation is 12.2   . the mean and median here are thus lower than the median from @xcite by @xmath6 5   .",
    "the distribution of @xmath1 from @xcite appears also to be substantially different from ours , having no major symmetrical component and having few low values .",
    "we suspect but can not definitely establish that the weymann @xmath1 values are systematically too large .",
    "perhaps the quasar sample that they used is not representative of the quasar population .",
    "another possibility is that weymann et al .  used the iraf splot algorithm , which was changed at about that time , leading to likely differences of @xmath6 15 per cent for wide , asymmetrical features ( iraf newsletter no . 9 , 1990 )",
    "conceivably , the differences could be larger still for a feature as wide as the fe  ii 2400    emission .",
    "low - ionisation bal quasars , showing mg  ii bal troughs , can lead to @xmath1 values that are too large , since the continuum for the @xmath1 measurement is then underestimated .",
    "such quasars can be removed using the database of @xcite , but in practice the rate of occurrence is too low to make anything other than a very slight difference to the analysis .",
    "the @xcite database does not allow removal of all problematic mg   ii absorption troughs , however , so , for the purpose of statistical analysis , we simply assume that they can be neglected as their rate of occurrence should be the same for both the lqg sample and the control sample .",
    "( we also make the same assumption for the sample extracted for u1.11 , u1.28 , u1.54 and u1.27 . )",
    "the distribution of the rest - frame equivalent width , @xmath1 , for the 2604 members of the 111 lqgs with @xmath0 is shown in fig .",

    "the figure shows in addition the distribution for a matched subset of the control sample as the hatched histogram ( red online ) .",
    "the matched subset , intended to negate possible dependences on magnitude and redshift , has been created from the final control sample by finding , for each member of the 111 lqgs , the member of the control sample that is closest in @xmath3 magnitude and in @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the redshift .",
    "the use of @xmath26 is so that we give equal weight to an interval of 0.1 in @xmath3 and @xmath28 in @xmath27 .",
    "both histograms are density histograms ( meaning that relative frequency is given by bin - height @xmath29 bin - width ) .",
    "both are for @xmath30 and @xmath14 , with the condition @xmath31 applied to the lqgs .",
    "a one - sided mann - whitney test indicates that there is a relative shift of the lqg - distribution to larger values at a level of significance given by the p - value @xmath32 .",
    "the median shift is estimated as 0.62   .",
    "note that the histograms of fig .",

    "the shift to higher @xmath1 thus appears to be a stronger effect at fainter magnitudes .",

    "there appears to be a discontinuity in the typical value of the 90th quantile and in the upper and lower envelopes at @xmath35 .        given this change at @xmath35",
    ", we apply instead the condition @xmath38 .",
    "it then appears that the shift of the lqg distribution to higher values of @xmath1 is strongly concentrated in this redshift range .",
    "[ w2400_all_lqgs_b ] is similar to fig .",
    "[ w2400_all_lqgs ] but instead gives the distribution of the rest - frame equivalent width , @xmath1 , for the 1778 members of the 75 lqgs with @xmath38 as the solid histogram ( blue online ) .",
    "the hatched histogram ( red online ) shows the distribution for the corresponding matched subset of the control sample . in this case",
    "the one - sided mann - whitney test indicates a relative shift of the lqg - distribution to larger values at p - value=@xmath39 .",
    "the median shift is estimated as 0.97   .",
    "note that this condition @xmath2 leads to the member quasars having redshifts in the range @xmath40 .",
    "if we again restrict the @xmath3 magnitudes of the lqg quasars to @xmath41 then the p - value becomes @xmath42 and the median shift becomes 1.31   .",
    "again , the shift to higher @xmath1 appears to be a stronger effect at fainter magnitudes .",
    "if , having considered the sub - range @xmath38 , we now consider only the remaining @xmath43 then there is no perceptible shift at all of the lqg - distribution to higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "of course , the number of lqgs and members is then somewhat smaller ( 36 lqgs , 826 members ) , but we cautiously conclude that the shift to higher @xmath1 is indeed strongly concentrated in the range @xmath44 .    in summary so far , we find a small but significant shift to higher values of @xmath1 for lqgs with @xmath38 .",
    "this result contrasts with that from @xcite and @xcite for a large shift for quasars with @xmath45 in the pencil - beam field that intersects the lqgs u1.11 , u1.28 and u1.54 .",
    "however , we do find some indication that the shift that we find here increases to fainter magnitudes .",
    "the mmt / hectospec data used by @xcite and @xcite are for quasars that are typically much fainter than those used here , so it may be that the results can still be reconciled .    fig .",

    "if the shift to higher @xmath1 within the lqgs arises from an environmental effect then we might anticipate there will be a density or clustering effect that appears most strongly for the ultrastrong emitters compared with the weak .",
    "there is an arbitary element to this approach , of course , because the definitions of ultrastrong , strong and weak emitters involve arbitrary boundaries .",
    "clowes & harris ( unpublished visualisation ) found that the strong and ultrastrong emitters tended to clump with other quasars or with themselves , both within and outside the convex hulls of the three lqgs u1.11 , u1.28 and u1.54 .",
    "( recall that the deep mmt / hectospec spectroscopy in the pencil - beam included quasars fainter than the @xmath13 limit of the quasars used for the discovery of the lqgs . )",
    "although this visualisation involved no quantification of the clumping , it has guided our thinking that there could be a preferred nearest - neighbour scale for the strongest emitters .",
    "for these reasons , we have investigated the distribution of nearest - neighbour separations for the ultrastrong emitters within the lqgs compared with the distribution for the weak emitters within the lqgs .",
    "the nearest neighbours have been determined without regard for the strength of their uv fe  ii emission .",
    "we consider only the lqgs with @xmath38 , given the earlier result that the shift to higher values of @xmath1 is strongly concentrated in this range .",
    "the distribution of the nearest - neighbour separations ( present epoch ) for the members of the 75 lqgs with @xmath38 and for @xmath54    ( i.e.  ultrastrong ) is shown in fig .  [ w2400nnsep_all_lqgs ] as the solid histogram ( blue online ) , with mean @xmath55  mpc .",

    "a mann - whitney test is inappropriate here because the lqg - finding algorithm restricts separations to @xmath58 100  mpc , but a one - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates that the cdf ( cumulative distribution function ) of the @xmath4    distribution is greater than the cdf of the @xmath52    distribution , with p - value @xmath59 , which is marginally significant .",
    "given the arbitrary boundaries for the definitions of ultrastrong , strong and weak emitters we note that a post - hoc adjustment from @xmath4    to @xmath5    gives the histograms shown in fig .",

    "although we find evidence for a preferred nearest - neighbour scale for the ultrastrong - emitting quasars in lqgs we find no evidence for a preferred scale in the quasars that are not members of lqgs ( mean nearest - neighbour separation @xmath6 78  mpc ) , across a comparable range of redshifts .",
    "thus the preferred nearest - neighbour scale of @xmath6 3050  mpc for the @xmath4    ( more precisely , @xmath5   ) emitters seems to be peculiar to the lqg environment .",
    "presumably , it is related to the shift to higher @xmath1 values within the lqgs .    we have similarly used the visualisation software to look at the environments of the strongest emitters from the entire memberships of the same three lqgs from @xcite and @xcite , u1.11 , u1.28 and u1.54 , together with u1.27 .",
    "given the above result on the nearest - neighbour separations we concentrate on the quasars with @xmath5    rather than simply @xmath4   .",
    "to simplify the discussion we introduce an ultrastrong - plus category as those with @xmath5    ( while still retaining `` ultrastrong '' as those with @xmath4   ) .",
    "the findings are similar to those previously , but not always so clear , perhaps because of the brighter limiting magnitude .",
    "for example , with u1.54 , the doubtful lqg , only two of the five ultrastrong - plus emitters appear to be closely associated with other quasars , and only one of these is in a dense region .",
    "in contrast , with u1.11 , three of four ultrastrong - plus emitters do seem to be associated with other quasars and denser regions . with u1.28 ,",
    "two of four ultrastrong - plus emitters appear to be close to other quasars , but with neither being in particularly dense regions . with u1.27 ( the huge - lqg ) , six of the seven ultrastrong - plus emitters form three pairs ( separations 52 , 81 , 105  mpc ) , within the total membership of 73 .",
    "one pairing is actually part of a close triplet with another quasar in a generally dense region , and another pairing is part of a looser triplet in a less dense region .",

    "we have compared the distribution of the @xmath1 equivalent width of uv fe ii emitting quasars in the dense environments of 111 lqgs having @xmath18 with the distribution for quasars that are not in lqgs .",
    "we find a marginally significant shift ( p - value @xmath32 , shift @xmath62   ) of the @xmath1 distribution to higher values for quasars within lqgs .",
    "the shift appears to be a stronger effect at fainter magnitudes @xmath41 ( p - value @xmath63 , shift @xmath64   ) .",
    "however , the shift to higher @xmath1 appears to be strongly concentrated in the 75 lqgs having @xmath38 ( p - value @xmath65 , shift @xmath66   ) , and again it appears to be a stronger effect at fainter magnitudes @xmath41 ( p - value @xmath67 , shift @xmath68   ) .",
    "we have investigated the distribution of nearest - neighbour separations for the ultrastrong emitters within the 75 lqgs having @xmath2 compared with the distribution for the weak emitters .",
    "the nearest neighbours were determined without regard for the strength of their uv fe ii emission .",
    "we found a marginally significant result ( p - value @xmath59 ) that the cdf of the ultrastrong ( @xmath4   ) distribution is greater than the cdf of the weak ( @xmath52   ) distribution .",
    "there appears to be a preferred nearest - neighbour separation predominantly in the range @xmath6 2550  mpc .",
    "we found that a post - hoc adjustment from ultrastrong @xmath4    to `` ultrastrong - plus '' @xmath69    gives improved significance ( p - value @xmath61 ) , and a preferred nearest - neighbour separation that then appears to be predominantly in the range @xmath6 3050  mpc .",
    "our finding of a shift towards higher values of @xmath1 for quasars within lqgs is compatible with the result from @xcite and @xcite of a shift for a deep pencil - beam field that intersects the three lqgs u1.11 , u1.28 and u1.54 ( the doubtful lqg ) .",
    "our shift seems smaller , but we do find an indication that the shift will increase to fainter magnitudes .",
    "the mmt / hectospec data used by @xcite and @xcite are for quasars that are typically much fainter than those used here , so it may be that the size of the shifts can still be reconciled .",
    "however , there is an inevitable difficulty in constructing a matching control sample for the faint mmt / hectospec sample , so possibly the attempted allowance for the differences has not been wholly successful and the size of the shift there then appears larger than it should be .",
    "we find that the shift is strongly concentrated in the range @xmath44 .",
    "u1.54 is excluded from our data by this condition of course , but fundamentally it is excluded because it fails our chms - significance criterion .",
    "clowes & harris ( unpublished visualisation ) noted , for the pencil - beam field within u1.11 , u1.28 and u1.54 , a tendency for strong / ultrastrong emitters to clump with other quasars or with themselves . with the data for the 75 lqgs having @xmath38 in this paper",
    "we find evidence that ultrastrong - plus emitters  those with @xmath5     have a preferred nearest - neighbour scale of @xmath6 3050  mpc .",
    "this result supports , and makes quantitative , the result from the visualisation .",
    "however , no such preferred scale is seen for ultrastrong - plus emitters that are not in lqgs .",
    "our visualisation of the ultrastrong - plus emitters across u1.11 , u1.28 and u1.54 in their entireties , together with u1.27 , is generally consistent with the deeper pencil - beam visualisation but not so clear . a striking result , however , is from u1.27 , the huge - lqg , for which six of the seven ultrastrong - plus emitters , from amongst the total of 73 lqg members , form three pairings .",
    "we have thus found two effects of the dense lqg environment on the ultraviolet fe  ii emission of the member quasars .",
    "firstly , there is a general shift to higher @xmath1 , compared with non - members for @xmath70 .",
    "the shift appears to be stronger for fainter magnitudes .",
    "this redshift dependence , @xmath71 , suggests an evolutionary effect .",
    "secondly , we find evidence for a preferred nearest - neighbour separation of @xmath6 3050  mpc for the ultrastrong ( @xmath54   ) or , more precisely , ultrastrong - plus ( @xmath5   ) emitters compared with the weak ( @xmath52 ) emitters within these lqgs .",
    "this preferred separation suggests a clustering or dynamical effect .",
    "of course , there may be further subtleties present in the dependences on redshift , magnitude and density than we have seen , but a still larger sample with which to disentangle them is not currently feasible .",
    "it may be , however , that a different approach on the existing data , such as fitting templates to the fe  ii , could restore some information that might presently be lost to uncertainties in measuring @xmath1 .",
    "the possibilities for increasing the strength of the fe  ii emission appear to be iron abundance , ly-@xmath7 fluorescence , and microturbulence .",
    "probably all of these operate .",
    "the dense environment of the lqgs and an increased rate of interactions and mergers between galaxies may have led to an increased rate of star formation and an enhanced abundance of iron in the nuclei of galaxies .",
