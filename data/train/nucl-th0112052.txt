    "the decay of vector mesons into @xmath13 and @xmath14 pairs offers a unique tool to explore the properties of dense and hot matter in nuclear collisions .",
    "the lepton pairs provide virtually undistorted information on the current - current correlation function @xmath15 in the medium  @xcite . at invariant masses in the range @xmath16 mev",
    ", @xmath17 is sensitive to in - medium modifications of the mass distribution of the light vector mesons @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , the observed enhancement of the di - lepton yield at small invariant masses in ultra relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite is presently interpreted in terms of in - medium modifications of the mass and width of the @xmath9 meson  @xcite . to leading orders in the baryon density ,",
    "modifications of the mass distribution are determined by the vector - meson nucleon scattering amplitudes . since these amplitudes are not directly constrained by data , there are presently large theoretical ambiguities in predictions of the vector - meson spectral densities in nuclear matter .",
    "this work is an attempt to overcome this problem by using the constraints from data on pion- and photon - nucleon reactions considering in particular the @xmath10 and @xmath9 production data in a systematic way .",
    "we develop a coupled - channel approach for meson - baryon and photon - baryon scattering , including the @xmath18 , @xmath1 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 channels where the interaction kernel is approximated by quasi - local 4-point interaction vertices .",
    "the description of photon - induced reactions is based on a vector - meson dominance type assumption which directly relates the electromagnetic quasi - local 4-point interaction vertices to the corresponding vertices involving the @xmath9 and @xmath10 fields .",
    "in such a scheme the amplitudes for experimentally non - accessible processes like @xmath1 and @xmath19 scattering are constrained by the data on elastic @xmath24 scattering and inelastic reactions like the pion - and photon - induced production of vector mesons .",
    "our primary goal is to derive the vector - meson nucleon scattering amplitudes close to threshold , which in turn determine the self energy of a vector - meson at rest in nuclear matter to leading order in density .",
    "thus it is sufficient to consider only s - wave scattering in the @xmath1 and @xmath19 channels . as a consequence of parity conservation ,",
    "this implies that in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 channels we need only s- and d - waves .",
    "in particular , we consider the @xmath26 and @xmath27 partial waves of @xmath24 scattering .",
    "to derive systematically the momentum dependence of the vector - meson self energy , vector - meson nucleon scattering in higher partial waves would have to be considered in addition .",
    "we concentrate on the energy window 1.4 gev @xmath28 1.8 gev and base our analysis on the conjecture that all baryon resonances except the baryon octet and decuplet ground states are generated by coupled channel dynamics . under these assumptions",
    "the application of quasi - local interaction terms is justified , because in all considered channels the interaction kernel is slowly varying in energy .    in this paper",
    "we expand the scope of existing coupled channel calculations  @xcite in several ways .",
    "first , we attempt a comprehensive description of pion and photon induced reactions , including for the first time the @xmath1 , @xmath19 photon - nucleon channels on equal footing .",
    "thus , we describe elastic @xmath24 scattering as well as pion and photon induced production cross sections within the same model .",
    "second , our approach is consistent with analyticity and causality , i.e. the amplitudes satisfy dispersion relations .",
    "this is not the case for models that employ the k - matrix approximation or extensions thereof  @xcite .",
    "analyticity is a fundamental property of the s - matrix and the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude plays an important role e.g. close to thresholds ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "since we are addressing the physics in an energy range where several production thresholds are located , this is an important feature of our model . finally , in our approach , which applies and generalizes the covariant projector technique of @xcite , baryon resonances can be generated by coupled channel dynamics .",
    "this offers an appropriate framework for testing the conjecture of dynamical generation of resonances  @xcite .",
    "if this conjecture is correct , a more economical description of the scattering amplitude follows , since there is no need for introducing explicit baryon resonances in the interaction kernel .",
    "we note that in the k - matrix approximation , the lack of analyticity prohibits the dynamical generation of resonances . thus , in such an approach the baryon resonances must be explicitly included in the interaction kernel ,    we obtain a satisfactory description of the elastic and inelastic @xmath24 and @xmath29 reaction data in the channels considered .",
    "the s- and d - wave nucleon resonances @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 and isobar resonances @xmath7 and @xmath8 are generated dynamically in our approach .",
    "whereas we predict considerable strength for the @xmath6 nucleon - hole component of the @xmath10 meson in nuclear matter , our analysis suggests only a moderate importance of the @xmath6 nucleon - hole states in the in - medium spectral function of the @xmath9 meson .",
    "in section 2 we first present the general hadronic coupled channel approach within the framework of the covariant projector operator technique of @xcite .",
    "we first introduce the projection operators for elastic @xmath24 scattering and subsequently generalize the scheme to include inelastic reactions between the different coupled channels . in the following section the specifics of the @xmath1 and @xmath20 channels",
    "are presented , while in section 4 we give the framework for the treatment of electromagnetic interactions .",
    "there we also motivate our choice for the vector meson dominance assumption .",
    "readers who are not interested in the technical details of the calculation may skip sections 2 - 4 and jump to the results , which are presented in section 5 . there",
    "the basic ingredients of our approach are recalled with appropriate references to the central equations in sections 2 - 4 .",
    "in this section we present the theoretical framework for our analysis of the meson - baryon scattering process .",
    "we construct an effective lagrangian with quasi - local four - point meson - baryon contact interactions . within this framework ,",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation for the coupled - channel system reduces to a matrix equation .",
    "the justification of our approximation strategy follows from two assumptions .",
    "first , we conjecture that all baryon resonances except the baryon octet and decuplet ground states are dynamically generated by coupled channel dynamics .",
    "and second , we aim at a description of elastic and inelastic pion - nucleon scattering in an energy window 1400 mev @xmath30 1800 mev only , where the interaction kernel is slowly varying in energy in all channels considered .",
    "this will be explained in detail later .    in order to keep the discussion transparent ,",
    "we first restrict ourselves to the pion - nucleon sector .",
    "consider the general pion - nucleon four - point interaction in momentum space @xmath31 where @xmath32 are isospin indices , and @xmath33 is a matrix in spinor space , which in general is a function of the relative momenta in the initial and final states @xmath34 and @xmath35 as well as the total momentum @xmath36 .",
    "here we use a generic two - body interaction kernel @xmath33 at tree - level as to specify the conventions applied throughout this work .",
    "the relation of the momentum - space object ( [ pin - lag-0 ] ) to the lagrangian density @xmath37 is obtained by defining the action , @xmath38 without loss of generality we may assume a crossing symmetric interaction kernel with @xmath39 simplifying the identification of any exchange term contribution .",
    "the fact that the effective interaction @xmath40 depends only on three combinations of the four 4-momenta introduced in ( [ lag - momentum ] ) is a consequence of the invariance of the coordinate - space interaction kernel under time- and space - translation .",
    "note for instance that the momenta @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 fields do not represent the 4-momenta of the physical pion states .",
    "this interpretation is legitimate only after the pion field is decomposed into positive and negative frequency parts @xmath45 in order to construct the isospin projectors , it is useful to split also the nucleon field into positive and negative frequency parts , defined by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the positive and negative energy spinors , respectively . here , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the pion annihilation and creation operators , while @xmath51 is the nucleon annihilation operator and @xmath52 is the anti - nucleon creation operator .    for the construction of the bethe - salpeter kernel , it is convenient to rearrange the interaction lagrangian , @xmath53 , which is considered in momentum space , as a sum of terms that project onto states of good isospin @xmath54 \\,k^{(\\frac 12)}(\\bar k , k ; w ) \\,[\\vec\\pi^{(+)}(q ) \\cdot\\vec\\tau]\\,n^{(+)}(p ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad + \\bar n^{(+)}(\\bar p)\\ , [ \\vec t\\cdot\\vec\\pi^{(-)}(\\bar q ) ] \\,k^{(\\frac 32)}(\\bar k , k ; w ) \\,[\\vec\\pi^{(+)}(q ) \\cdot\\vec t]\\,n^{(+)}(p)\\,+ \\dots\\ , , \\label{dots}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a pauli matrix in isospin space and @xmath56 an isospin @xmath57 to @xmath58 transition matrix and @xmath59 the interaction kernel for states with isospin @xmath60 .",
    "the normalization of the isospin transition matrices is such that @xmath61 . in ( [ pin - lag ] )",
    "we have only written the terms that explicitly contribute to pion - nucleon scattering in the born approximation .",
    "these are sufficient to specify the tree - level bethe - salpeter kernel .",
    "the additional terms , indicated by the dots in ( [ dots ] ) , contribute to the production and absorption of two pions and are uniquely determined by covariance .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this scheme to the coupled - channel problem at hand .",
    "the interaction lagrangian can thus be written in the form @xmath62 where again we show only those terms that contribute to meson - baryon scattering in the born approximation .",
    "the state vectors @xmath63 are given by @xmath64 note that the spin and isospin structure of the states is implicit in ( [ r - def ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath65 is an isovector and @xmath66 an isoscalar vector field , while e.g. the nucleon is an isospin doublet dirac spinor field .",
    "similarly , the @xmath67 is a rarita - schwinger isospin 3/2 field .",
    "these fields combine with the corresponding elements of the kernel @xmath68 and the isospin operators in ( [ r - def ] ) .",
    "for instance , the vector index of the @xmath65 and @xmath66 fields are contracted with a vector index of the corresponding term in the kernel .",
    "the coupled - channel bethe - salpeter equation defines the scattering amplitudes with @xmath69 , @xmath70 but @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the analogous convention is chosen for the @xmath73 channel . ]",
    "projected onto a given isospin then reads @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote the meson and baryon propagators in a given channel .",
    "evidently the interaction kernel @xmath77 in the bethe - salpter equation ( [ bs - coupled ] ) is not necessarily restricted to the tree - level expressions discussed in detail above .",
    "it encompasses all feynman diagrams which are two - particle irreducible in the s - channel .",
    "off - diagonal components of @xmath78 are due to the matrix structure of the vector - meson and isobar propagators .",
    "a convenient labelling of the channels is obtained by defining @xmath79 the meson and baryon propagators @xmath75 and @xmath76 in ( [ bs - coupled ] ) are @xmath80 the spectral distributions of the vector mesons , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and that of the isobar - resonance , @xmath83 , will be specified in the subsequent section , where the pion - induced vector - meson and isobar production processes are discussed .",
    "the propagators of the @xmath84 and @xmath33 mesons as well as of the @xmath85 and @xmath86 baryons are , except for the mass , identical to the pion and nucleon propagators , respectively .    a convenient way to perform the partial - wave expansion is offered by the covariant projector formalism introduced in  @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the underlying strategy leading to the projector formulation can be found in that paper .",
    "here we generalize this approach in order to include the @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 channels .",
    "the interaction kernel @xmath90 is expanded in a series of channel - dependent projectors @xmath91_{ab}$ ] , @xmath92_{ab } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\,v^{(i-)}_{ab}(\\sqrt{s};n)\\,\\big[{y}_{n}^{(-)}(\\bar q , q;w)\\big]_{ab } \\ ; , \\label{not - def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath93 , @xmath94 and a set of energy - dependent effective interaction kernels @xmath95 .",
    "the projectors are constructed in a way that states corresponding to different projectors with given total angular momentum @xmath96 do not couple in the bethe - salpeter equation ( [ bs - coupled ] ) .",
    "any given projector @xmath97 is a finite polynomial in the dirac matrices @xmath98 and @xmath99 and the four - momenta @xmath100 .",
    "a further crucial property of the projectors is that they are free of any kinematical singularities in @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "only then the set of projectors decouples in the bethe - salpeter equation ( [ bs - coupled ] ) in any frame .    in general the bethe - salpeter interaction kernel @xmath105",
    "may have additional contributions not of the form ( [ not - def ] ) .",
    "such terms do not lead to s - channel unitarity cuts if iterated in the bethe - salpeter equation , since , by construction of the projectors , they vanish for on - shell kinematics . in @xcite",
    "it is shown explicitly that these terms may be considered as part of the irreducible loop corrections of an effective interaction kernel @xmath106 .",
    "note that the form of the projectors implies a particular off - shell behavior of the interaction kernel . from a field",
    "theoretical point of view the off - shell structure of the interaction kernel and also that of the scattering amplitude is not defined because it may be changed at will by redefining the hadronic interpolating fields @xcite .",
    "however , as was emphasized in @xcite the proper treatment of the bethe - salpeter equation requires a systematic on - shell reduction as to avoid an unphysical and uncontrolled dependence on the choice of chiral coordinates or the choice of interpolating fields .",
    "a covariant on - shell reduction can be defined unambiguously with respect to the covariant set of projectors that solve the bethe - salpeter equation for any choice of quasi - local interaction terms .",
    "the systematic on - shell reduction of the bethe - salpeter interaction kernel then leads to an effective interaction kernel of the form imposed in ( [ not - def ] ) .",
    "given an interaction kernel of the form ( [ not - def ] ) , the coupled - channel scattering amplitudes @xmath107 can be decomposed accordingly : @xmath108_{ab } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\,m^{(i-)}_{ab}(\\sqrt{s};n)\\ , \\big[{y}_{n}^{(-)}(\\bar q , q;w)\\big]_{ab } \\;.",

    "a priori it is unclear that the left hand side of ( [ j - n - def ] ) does not involve additional terms not proportional to @xmath114 . furthermore , since the integral in ( [ j - n - def ] ) diverges , the loop functions are defined only in conjunction with a suitable renormalization scheme , to be discussed below .",
    "the consistency of ( [ j - n - def ] ) is verified by explicit calculations .    before we proceed with the presentation of the projectors and loop functions , we first discuss the general form of the interaction kernel used in this work",
    ". it may be obtained from a meson exchange model or more systematically from the chiral lagrangian .",
    "here we use the concept of an effective field theory in a sense that differs somewhat from common practice .",
    "usually this concept is used to describe the physics close to threshold , like e.g. in chiral perturbation theory , which is based on a systematic expansion in powers of the momentum @xcite . in this paper",
    "we construct an effective field theory for meson - nucleon scattering in the resonance region .",
    "the philosophy of this approach is to approximate the slowly varying interaction kernels @xmath115 with simple coupling functions , and to treat rescattering in the s - channel explicitly . by allowing an arbitrary energy dependence of @xmath115",
    ", one could certainly describe the phase shifts at any energy , as long as all open channels are included .",
    "however , such a model has essentially no predictive power . in our scheme , the predictive power results from the assumption that the interaction kernel is slowly varying in energy in the relevant window 1.4 gev@xmath116 gev .",
    "this assumption is based on the following observation .",
    "a small scale , which implies a strong energy dependence of the scattering amplitude , is a reflection of nearby singularities .",
    "in general the partial - wave amplitudes have an analytic structure which is more complicated than the s - channel singularities generated by rescattering . there are left - hand cuts generated by @xmath117- and @xmath118-channel exchanges of mesons and baryons , which are not treated explicitly in our approach .",
    "these cuts are located in an unphysical region , but the exchange of light mesons , e.g. the pion , may give rise to a rapid energy variation close to threshold because the branch point is located relatively close to the physical region .",
    "however , far above threshold , the energy variation due to the left - hand cuts is unimportant , and the interaction kernel can be approximated by slowly varying function .",
    "we have checked by explicit calculation that , for the partial waves considered , this is the case in the energy region of interest here .",
    "consequently , we employ the following simple ansatz for the interaction kernel : @xmath119 where the linear dependence in ( [ ansatz ] ) on @xmath120 is imposed in order to guarantee a regular behaviour of the scattering amplitude at @xmath121 ( see ( [ cov - proj ] ) ) .",
    "the linear dependence in @xmath120 removes an unphysical kinematical singularity of the scattering amplitudes at @xmath122 , which is due to the form of the projectors in the definition of the projection operators and take the interaction kernel independent of @xmath120 .",
    "although this simple interpolation perhaps does not yield an accurate representation of the scattering amplitude outside the window of applicability , because it does not account for e.g. the @xmath117- and @xmath118-channel singularities , we expect at least a qualitative description also there .    in this context , one may worry that the s - channel contributions of baryon ground states and resonance to the interaction kernel may lead to a rapid energy variation in our energy window 1.4 gev@xmath116 gev .",
    "our ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) is justified by the following observations . in this work",
    "we consider only s - wave interactions in the vector - meson nucleon channels . because of parity conservation these couple only to the s- and d - wave pion - nucleon channels . in these channels",
    "the large @xmath123 baryon ground - state states , the positive parity baryon octet and decuplet states , do not lead to pole structures in the corresponding kernels , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "furthermore , the large @xmath123 excited states are not explicitly included in ( [ ansatz ] ) since we aim to generate those as resonances of the ground - state degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the basis for this strategy is the hypothesis that large @xmath123 counting rules can be applied to the interaction kernel but not to the scattering amplitude .",
    "this is supported by the following argument .",
    "the reducible diagrams summed by the bethe - salpeter equation are typically enhanced by a factor @xmath126 compared to irreducible diagrams .",
    "thus , a reducible diagram , which in the large @xmath123 expansion is suppressed by a factor @xmath127 , acquires a total factor @xmath128 . for @xmath129",
    "this factor is about @xmath130 , which indicates that the large @xmath123 expansion is not useful for reducible diagrams .",
    "consequently , it is unclear whether baryon resonances are already present in the interaction kernel , i.e. included in the irreducible diagrams , or generated by coupled - channel dynamics , i.e. by including reducible diagrams .",
    "the fact that baryon resonances typically have large decay widths we take as an indication that indeed the coupled - channel dynamics is the driving mechanism for the creation of baryon resonances .",

    "this confirms the angular momentum assignment implicit in ( [ match ] ) . in the presence of inelastic channels",

    "the projectors of the @xmath21 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 channels are identical to the ones of the pion - nucleon channels .",

    "we use the approximate mass parameters @xmath168 mev , @xmath169 mev , @xmath170 mev , @xmath171 mev , @xmath172 mev and @xmath173 mev throughout this work .",

    "the latter channel is viewed as an effective channel that takes into account some residual effects from the @xmath177 channel .",
    "we , however , consider the @xmath19 channel because its mass is almost degenerate with that of the @xmath9 meson and the @xmath10 meson is expected to couple strongly to baryons .    before constructing the appropriate projectors required in ( [ not - def ] )",
    "it is useful to describe the general framework within which our expressions should be considered .",
    "we assume that the vector - meson fields satisfy the proca equation which follows from the lagrangian density @xmath178 where we , for later convenience , allow for a wave - function renormalization .",
    "as is well known , the corresponding feynman propagator sustains only ( 4-dimensionally ) transverse modes .",
    "when interactions of the @xmath11 meson with other fields are taken into account , its propagator is modified by the polarization tensor @xmath179 , which in vacuum has two independent components , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "the @xmath11-meson propagator is then given by @xmath182 the first term is the transverse component of the propagator , while the second one is the longitudinal one . in a scheme , where the vector meson couples to a conserved current ,",
    "the vector - meson nucleon scattering amplitude is transverse , i.e. @xmath183 vanish @xcite .",
    "however , in an approximation scheme , where the corresponding current is not conserved , the longitudinal self energy differs from zero and the longitudinal propagator may exhibit singularities , which correspond to the propagation of unphysical degrees of freedom .",

    "however , in the present scheme , which does not include e.g. the p - wave channels , this would not make sense because potentially important contributions to the total cross sections are missing .",
    "we point out that the relative distribution of the various inelastic channels is constrained by the @xmath1 and @xmath20 production data because these data clearly prevent an overestimate of the inelasticity into the two - pion channel . here",

    "channel differential cross sections are not available and since there is no reason to expect the production cross section to be dominated by s- and d - waves at the energies considered , we do not fit the isobar production cross sections directly . moreover , we note that the angular distribution of the two - pion production data is to a large extend already encoded in the inelasticity parameters of the pion - nucleon phase shifts , provided that the relative importance of the dominant inelastic two - pion channels @xmath1 and @xmath73 are treated correctly .    in some of the data sets , like e.g. the total cross section for the reaction @xmath381 ,",

    "this would lead to an undesired imbalance between the large and small data sets . in order to obtain a uniform reproduction of all data sets , we therefore introduce weighting factors , which enhance the weight of small data sets , when otherwise a reasonable overall description could not be obtained .",
    "moreover , for the production cross sections we reduce the upper limit of the fitting window down to values where we expect the cross section to be dominated by s - wave dynamics . in view of this it does not make too much sense to provide the final chi - squared of our fit .",

    "we emphasize that the rigorous evaluation of the vector - meson spectral functions requires an approach in which the transformation of the scattering amplitudes from the center of mass system into the laboratory frame is well defined .",
    "this transformation can be quite non - trivial for states with high spin and angular momentum . clearly , the covariant projector technique applied in this work fulfils this requirement .",

    "<S> we construct a relativistic and unitary approach to high energy pion- and photon - nucleon reactions taking the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 final states into account . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme dynamically generates the s- and d - wave nucleon resonances @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 and isobar resonances @xmath7 and @xmath8 in terms of quasi - local interaction vertices . </S>",
    "<S> the description of photon - induced processes is based on a generalized vector - meson dominance assumption which directly relates the electromagnetic quasi - local 4-point interaction vertices to the corresponding vertices involving the @xmath9 and @xmath10 fields . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a satisfactory description of the elastic and inelastic pion- and photon - nucleon scattering data in the channels considered . the resulting s - wave @xmath11- and @xmath12-nucleon scattering amplitudes are presented . using these amplitudes </S>",
    "<S> we compute the leading density modification of the @xmath9 and @xmath12 energy distributions in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> we find a repulsive energy shift for the @xmath12 meson at small nuclear density but predict considerable strength in resonance - hole like @xmath12-meson modes . </S>",
    "<S> compared to previous calculations our result for the @xmath9-meson spectral function shows a significantly smaller in - medium effect . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects a fairly small coupling strength of the n(1520 ) resonance to the @xmath1 channel .    </S>",
