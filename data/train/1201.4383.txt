    "while the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson has not been observed at the large hadron collider with sufficient statistical significance , the allowed range of higgs masses is rapidly shrinking and there are preliminary hints of a higgs boson with mass around 125  gev  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson will certainly provide indirect information about extensions of the sm .",
    "precision electroweak corrections favor a light higgs , so a heavier higgs would indicate new contributions to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters  @xcite , and a 125  gev higgs means such contributions must be small .    here , we examine contributions to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters arising from scalars transforming in the triplet representation of the @xmath2 .",
    "triplet scalars are a common ingredient of many extensions of the sm , such as guts , little higgs models , and seesaw models for neutrino masses . in some instances , they also provide a cold dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "there are many other models that utilize triplet scalars .",
    "we consider heavy triplets with masses in the tev range , or higher .",
    "we discuss two cases : triplets with either hypercharge 0 or 1 .",
    "such triplets can develop a vacuum expectation value without breaking the electromagnetic @xmath4 and can have relevant couplings with the higgs doublet .",
    "we consider the most general renormalizable potential for a triplet and the higgs doublet .",
    "the sm with a heavy triplet exhibits a hierarchy of scales characterized by the small parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the electroweak scale and @xmath7 is the triplet mass .",
    "this separation of scales motivates the use of an effective field theory ( eft ) approach to study the triplet s effect on electroweak parameters .",
    "accordingly , we integrate out the triplet at one - loop level and match to the sm with additional higher - dimensional operators @xmath8 , with coefficients suppressed by appropriate powers of @xmath7 .",
    "the triplet s contribution to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters is encoded in the coefficients of two higher - dimensional operators .",
    "we calculate these coefficients and also include their rg running from the matching scale , @xmath7 , down to the electroweak scale , @xmath6 .",
    "the logarithmic enhancement can be numerically relevant , although unlikely to be very important since large logarithms can only appear for very large triplet masses , in which case the triplet contributions to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters are small anyway . nevertheless ,",
    "for completeness , we take rg evolution into account .",
    "the triplet s contribution to @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be expanded in terms of @xmath5 .",
    "we work to leading order in this expansion , which allows for two important simplifications .",
    "first , only dimension 6 operators contribute at this order , and second , the masses of all sm fields can be set to zero . since the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters are dimensionless , the higher - dimensional operators @xmath8 contribute to @xmath0 and @xmath1 proportionately to @xmath9 - 4}$ ] , where @xmath10 $ ] is the dimension of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 contributions come only from dimension 6 operators .",
    "any contribution to dimension-6 operators from nonzero sm particle masses , which are proportional to the higgs vev , starts at order @xmath11 .",
    "such a contribution would yield order @xmath12 terms for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , thus we neglect masses of sm fields .    hence we perform all our calculations in the unbroken phase and avoid the complications of re - expressing fields in terms of mass eigenstates .",
    "this is an important difference from previous studies on the electroweak phenomenology of triplet scalars  @xcite .",
    "the eft approach combined with the manifest @xmath3 symmetry provides us with a transparent framework to systematically calculate all one - loop corrections to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters coming from the triplet and obtain electroweak bounds on its mass and couplings .",
    "our results can be used for analyzing electroweak constraints on sm extensions with a scalar triplet .",
    "there are several articles in the literature , starting with @xcite and later corroborated in @xcite , where it was argued that one - loop corrections to the @xmath1 parameter from triplet scalars do not decouple .",
    "we find no such behavior .",
    "the results in @xcite are obtained in the broken phase of the theory . in the eft approach",
    "it is difficult to understand how a non - decoupling contribution may arise .",
    "there are no dimensionless parameters which grow with the triplet mass .",
    "there is a cubic scalar term , of mass dimension one , that is assumed to grow proportionately to the triplet mass , but ratios of mass parameters are assumed not to increase when the triplet mass increases .",

    "we calculated the corrections to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters induced by electroweak triplet scalars up to one - loop order .",
    "we considered the most general renormalizable lagrangian for a triplet scalar coupled to the sm higgs doublet .",
    "we computed the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters in an effective theory in which the triplets are integrated out by considering the corresponding operators of dimension 6 , that is we worked to the leading order in @xmath52 .",
    "our results are contained in eqs .",
    "( [ frstn ] ) through ( [ frssc ] ) .",
    "there are two reasons for performing this calculation .",
    "first , it is useful for constraining the parameter space of the triplets . in most cases ,",
    "the tree - level contribution to @xmath1 dominates the corrections to the oblique parameters .",
    "this dominant correction is proportional to the cubic coupling of the triplet to higgs doublets in eqs .",
    "( [ l0 ] ) and ( [ l1 ] ) .",
    "when the cubic coupling is small the loop effects can be significant .",
    "there are 1-loop contributions to @xmath0 that are independent of the cubic coupling , and for the charged triplet there is also a quartic coupling that contributes to @xmath1 independently of the cubic coupling .",
    "the second reason is that there are several results in the literature in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that find that the corrections from the triplets do not decouple in the limit of large triplet masses at the one - loop level . if true , this is of important consequence for triplet phenomenology .",
    "however , we find no such behavior and the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters approach zero for large triplet mass . the cubic coupling , @xmath45 , between the triplet and the higgs doublet involves a dimensionful constant . as in the references above",
    ", we assume that the dimensionless ratio @xmath75 does not increase with @xmath7 , that is in the large @xmath7 limit @xmath45 does not grow faster than @xmath7 .    the calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite were performed in the broken phase , in which the triplet and the doublet acquire vevs .",
    "we work in the unbroken phase of the theory .",
    "it is not clear to us why these two approaches would give different answers .",
    "decoupling is not at all surprising in the effective theory .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters correspond to dimension-6 operators and are thus inversely proportional to the triplet mass squared .",
    "dimensionful couplings , like @xmath45 , can only enter in the ratio @xmath75 , and can not appear in ratios with a light scale , for example as @xmath82 .",
    "this statement is independent of the loop order",
    ".    one might be leery of a result obtained in the unbroken phase .",
    "of course , this should not be an issue as symmetry breaking is a low - energy effect .",
    "a properly constructed effective theory matches the infrared behavior of the full theory . a partial result for the @xmath1 parameter was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was explicitly shown how the infrared divergencies match between the full and effective theories when the triplet is decoupled at one loop . in other words ,",
    "the coefficients of effective operators are independent of the higgs vev and therefore can be computed assuming a vanishing vev .",
    "the unbroken phase calculation offers one advantage ",
    "it is less complicated .",
    "there is no need to find mass eigenstates and no need to re - express interactions in terms of mass eigenstates .",
