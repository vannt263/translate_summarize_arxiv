    "in this paper we study analytically a certain continuation scenario , the so - called _",
    "homoclinic snaking _ , of homoclinic orbits in systems without particular structure such as reversibility or hamiltonian structure .",
    "consider an ordinary differential equation @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "given an equilibrium @xmath0 , a homoclinic orbit to @xmath0 is a solution that converges to @xmath0 as @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath0 is hyperbolic , a homoclinic orbit lies in the intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the equilibrium . for general differential equations , stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic equilibria will typically not intersect by the kupka - smale theorem @xcite .",
    "transversality arguments show that in one - parameter families of differential equations one can expect an intersection , and hence a homoclinic orbit , to occur persistently at an isolated parameter value .",
    "therefore a continuation of a homoclinic orbit can be carried out in two - parameter families of differential equations .",
    "indeed , the homoclinic orbits we consider live within a small neighbourhood of a heteroclinic cycle connecting a hyperbolic equilibrium @xmath0 and a hyperbolic periodic orbit @xmath1 .",
    "such a cycle consists , besides @xmath0 and @xmath1 , of two orbits @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the orbit @xmath7 is called heteroclinic orbit connecting @xmath0 to @xmath1 or in short , etop connecting orbit , or just etop connection .",
    "a similar terminology holds for @xmath13 just with interchanging @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the complete cycle we call etop cycle .",
    "more precisely , the homoclinic orbits to the equilibrium under consideration are one - homoclinic orbits with respect to the given etop cycle",
    ". that means they move once along the cycle before returning to the equilibrium .",
    "replace the periodic orbit @xmath1 by a hyperbolic equilibrium @xmath14 , and assume that for a critical value in a two - dimensional parameter space there exists a heteroclinic eto@xmath15 cycle .",
    "then , typically there is a curve emanating from the critical value such that for all parameter values on this curve there exits a homoclinic orbit to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the homoclinic orbit spends more and more time near @xmath14 when moving along this curve towards the critical point .",
    "considering homoclinic orbits to @xmath0 in a neighbourhood of an etop cycle , we also find that along the continuation curve the homoclinic orbits spend more and more time near the periodic orbit .",
    "in contrast to the eto@xmath15-case the continuation curve does not converge to a point , but it approaches a curve segment as @xmath16 does in figure  [ f : laser ] below .",
    "this makes the consideration global in the parameter space . before discussing this in more detail we consider the problem from the homoclinic snaking point of view .    in the context of ordinary differential equations",
    "the notion _ homoclinic snaking _ originally denotes a continuation scenario of homoclinic orbits in reversible hamiltonian systems . in hamiltonian systems",
    "the situation is somewhat different to the one described above .",
    "both the stable and the unstable manifold of a hyperbolic equilibrium are in the same levelset of the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore they will typically intersect transversely ( within this levelset ) and a homoclinic orbit can be expected to occur persistently in a single system .",
    "hence a continuation can be done in one - parameter families .",
    "typical continuation curves related to a homoclinic snaking scenario are displayed in figure  [ f : sw_ho ] , cf .",

    "figure  [ f : sw_ho ] shows continuation curves of homoclinic orbits related to the fourth order scalar equation @xmath17 considered as a system in @xmath18 , equation is a reversible hamiltonian system with family parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the two intertwined wiggly curves correspond to symmetric ( w.r.t .",
    "the reflection @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) homoclinic orbits asymptotic to a hyperbolic equilibrium .",
    "these curves are also called _ snaking curves_. the term snaking is due to the sinusoidal shape of the continuation curves .",
    "indeed , the homoclinic orbits under consideration are one - homoclinic w.r.t . a symmetric heteroclinic cycle connecting a symmetric equilibrium with a symmetric periodic orbit . restricted to the corresponding levelset of the hamiltonian ,",
    "the periodic orbit is hyperbolic .",
    "the excursion of the homoclinic orbit to the periodic orbit lasts longer and longer along the continuation curves .",
    "the homoclinic orbit performs more and more windings about the periodic orbit ",
    "this corresponds to the increase of its @xmath22-norm .",
    "roughly speaking , the @xmath19-range of the snaking curves is the @xmath19-range for which the heteroclinic cycle does exist . at the endpoints of the @xmath19-interval",
    "the involved etop and ptoe connections ( note that they are images of each other by the reversing symmetry ) simultaneously undergo a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "note that the snaking curves indicate saddle - node bifurcations of the symmetric homoclinic orbits .",
    "these bifurcation points are close to the endpoints of the @xmath19-range for the heteroclinic cycle .",
    "in addition to the snaking curves , figure  [ f : sw_ho ] also displays a ladder structure .",
    "the rungs connecting the two snaking curves correspond to asymmetric homoclinic orbits to the equilibrium .",
    "the asymmetric homoclinic orbits bifurcate from the symmetric ones via pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "these bifurcation points are close to the saddle - nodes of the symmetric homoclinic orbits . however , in the context of the present treatment it is enough to focus on the features of one single snaking curve .",
    "bifurcation diagrams as displayed in figure  [ f : sw_ho ] have been discussed for instance in @xcite . for a more complete list of references",
    "we refer to @xcite , but with the addition that homoclinic snaking , also called collapsed snaking , near eto@xmath15  cycles in one - parameter families of reversible systems has been studied in @xcite .",

    "one of the heteroclinic connections constituting the etop cycle does not lie in a transversal intersection of the corresponding stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "hence , by the same arguments as given above for homoclinic orbits , one can expect to find it on a continuation curve in the @xmath24-space .",

    "in other words , the region where the snaking curve is located is related to the existence of the robust heteroclinic connection between the equilibrium and the periodic orbit .",

    "the snaking curve accumulates at the line segment for which the etop cycle does exist .    in this paper",
    "we give an analytical verification of the bifurcation diagram in figure  [ f : laser ] within a more general setup .",
    "we consider a general two - parameter family of differential equations in @xmath23 . in this general context",
    "we denote the family parameter by @xmath32 taken from a closed rectangle @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that there is a closed interval @xmath34 such that for all @xmath35 there exists an etop cycle connecting an equilibrium and a periodic orbit , both are assumed to be hyperbolic , cf .",
    "hypothesis  [ h : general ] .",
    "let @xmath5 be two - dimensional .",
    "we want to note that this setting is related to the vector field @xmath36 in .",
    "compare also the caption of figure  [ f : laser ] .",
    "further we constitute conditions concerning the global intersection behaviour of @xmath37 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath38 , respectively , cf .",
    "hypotheses  [ h : ptoe1 ]  [ h : etop ] .",
    "note that all manifolds depend on @xmath39 , which is so far suppressed from the notation .",
    "indeed , the snaking behaviour is mainly influenced by the behaviour of the intersection of @xmath37 and @xmath5 .",
    "consider a small torus @xmath40 around @xmath1 , and let @xmath41 be a small stripe on this torus around @xmath42 .",
    "similarly we define @xmath43 as a small stripe on this torus around @xmath38 . in @xmath44",
    "we collect the intersections of @xmath37 and @xmath5 in @xmath41 depending on @xmath39 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the strong unstable fibre of @xmath47 . the assumption that @xmath48 is graph of a function @xmath49 is essential for the snaking behaviour .",
    "our hypotheses on @xmath50 imply amongst others that at the endpoints of @xmath34 the ptoe connection undergoes a saddle - node bifurcation , and what is more , for each @xmath51 there are at least two etop cycles .    to get a better idea of what these assumptions include , suppose for simplicity that the trace of @xmath5 in @xmath41 is a closed curve which is simple over @xmath37 .",
    "so @xmath5 can be seen as function @xmath52 of values in @xmath37 . to simplify matters",
    "further we assume that by changing @xmath39 these curves will be shifted against each other without changing their shape .",
    "then @xmath52 and @xmath53 are directly related .    for @xmath54 and all @xmath55",
    ", there is a unique etop connection ; all those @xmath56 can be written in the form @xmath57 .",
    "our hypotheses on the etop connection provide the existence of a @xmath58-periodic function @xmath59 defining the base point of the strong stable fibre of @xmath1 which intersects in @xmath60 the etop connection related to @xmath54 , @xmath61 .",
    "our main snaking result , cf .",
    "theorem  [ t : snaking ] , says that all one - homoclinic orbits near the primary etop cycles lie on one continuation curve , which we refer to as the snaking curve .",
    "this curve can be parametrised by the flight time @xmath62 of the one - homoclinic orbit between @xmath60 and @xmath41 . for @xmath63 ,",
    "this curve accumulates at @xmath64 .",
    "it turns out that the shape of the snaking curve is mainly determined by @xmath50  more precisely @xmath65 arises as a perturbation of @xmath66 .    in the scenario covered by theorem  [ t : snaking ]",
    "the nontrivial floquet multipliers of @xmath1 are positive .",
    "indeed , the snaking behaviour depends on the sign of these multipliers .",
    "if they are positive , the local ( un)stable manifold of @xmath1 is topologically a cylinder , while for negative multipliers these local manifolds are topologically a mbius strip .",
    "therefore , for positive multipliers both @xmath60 and @xmath41 consist of two connected components . in our analysis",
    "however , only one of these components , in each case , plays a role  and there is only one way for the transition from @xmath60 to @xmath41 .",
    "but if the multipliers are negative , then @xmath60 and @xmath41 are connected , and both are winding twice around @xmath1 on @xmath40 .",
    "this results in two different ways for the transition from @xmath60 to @xmath41 , and this causes the existence of two snaking curves approaching @xmath64 from different sides , cf . theorem  [ t : snaking_floquet ] .",
    "next we abandon our assumption on @xmath48 being graph of a function and assume rather that for fixed @xmath67 the set @xmath48 is a closed curve , and replace hypothesis  [ h : ptoe2 ] by hypothesis  [ h : ptoe2-non - snake ] .",
    "this prevents snaking . in this case",
    "no longer all homoclinic orbits are on one continuation curve , instead there exists a sequence of closed homoclinic continuation curves in the @xmath39-plane accumulating at @xmath68 , cf .",
    "theorem  [ t : nonsnaking ] .",
    "numerically we show that for the motivating system our hypotheses generating snaking are fulfilled .",
    "in particular we verify hypothesis  [ h : ptoe2 ] .",
    "for our analysis we use fenichel coordinates near the periodic orbit , and within this setting we consider solutions of a shilnikov problem which we glue together with the stable and unstable manifolds of the equilibrium .",
    "this procedure is the same as the one utilised in @xcite and @xcite to study reversible hamiltonian systems . to our knowledge",
    "there are only a few further works presenting analytical results for the dynamics near etop cycles . in @xcite",
    "a lin s method approach has been extended to treat heteroclinic chains involving period orbits .",
    "these results are applied to etop cycles , in particular to detect nearby one - homoclinic orbits .",
    "however , the results are more local in nature .",
    "these results concern , in the context of figure  [ f : laser ] , the existence of one - homoclinic orbits for parameter values in the neighbourhood of certain points on the curve @xmath26  but not in the neighbourhood of an entire segment of @xmath26 as in the present paper . in @xcite",
    "a somewhat different ( in handling the flow near @xmath1 ) lin s method approach has been used to study etop cycles of codimension - one and codimension - two . in this language the etop cycle considered in the present paper are of codimension - one .",
    "rademacher s results about homoclinic orbits near codimension - one etop cycles are of the same nature as the ones in @xcite .    in our analysis",
    "we assume the existence of a primary etop cycle , and we make assumptions about its global ( in parameter space ) behaviour . in the swift - hohenberg equation",
    "the existence of heteroclinic connections has been investigated analytically in @xcite .    in @xcite , amongst others , homoclinic",
    "snaking caused by an etop cycle in systems in @xmath23 is considered .",
    "using a combination of geometric and analytical arguments , the snaking behaviour as displayed in figure  [ f : laser ] is explained .",
    "more precisely , based on a leading term approximation of the bifurcation equation , one - homoclinic orbits near the saddle - node points of the etop cycles are determined . then the entire snaking curve is deduced by using geometric arguments .",
    "this has been done for both , when @xmath1 has positive or negative floquet multipliers . here in the present paper on the contrary",
    ", we give a rigorous analytical verification of these scenarios .",
    "numerically the homoclinic snaking scenario in the addressed model , which is inspired by semiconductor laser dynamics , has been considered in several papers .",
    "the snaking curve @xmath16 , cf . figure  [ f : laser ] , was first revealed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the relation to the organising etop cycle was numerically discovered in a bifurcation diagram similar to that in figure  [ f : laser ] .",
    "this system was further investigated in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a similar snaking behaviour was ( numerically ) observed in a nine - dimensional model equation of intracellular calcium dynamics .",
    "the remarkable feature in the bifurcation diagram is that turning points of the snaking curve accumulate on six different values ( and not on only two as in the one displayed in figure  [ f : laser ] ) .",
    "note that our analysis is carried out only for the case of a three - dimensional state space .",
    "however , the set @xmath48 remains a curve also in higher dimensions .",
    "then a corresponding function @xmath50 can be defined , and the addressed feature can be explained by the number of critical points of @xmath50 , cf . also figure  [ f : z_lambda_relat ] below .    in @xcite",
    "homoclinic snaking in the transition from reversible hamiltonian systems to general systems using the example of the swift - hohenberg equation is considered .",
    "indeed this happens in @xmath18 , but the observed snaking or nonsnaking behaviour in the perturbed system , respectively , discloses features we discuss for general systems in @xmath23 . in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  6 ) snaking curves of two different homoclinic orbits are shown  each curve displaying a behaviour as shown in figure  [ f : laser1 ] of the present paper .",
    "these two different homoclinic orbits are remains of the unperturbed reversible hamiltonian system .",
    "isolas of homoclinic orbits as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figures  2  and  3 ) are discussed in section  [ s : nonsnak_ana ] of this paper . in symmetric systems those isolas",
    "are also observed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  24 ) .",
    "however , it is not the aim of this paper to explain those transition processes .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [",
    "s : setup_res ] we present our hypotheses and formulate the main snaking result , theorem  [ t : snaking ] . the proof of theorem  [ t : snaking ] , is then carried out in section  [ s : snak_ana ] . in section  [ s : neg_floqu_mul ]",
    "we treat negative floquet multipliers .",
    "the results are summarised in theorem  [ t : snaking_floquet ] .",
    "afterwards we discuss one possible nonsnaking scenario in section  [ s : nonsnak_ana ] ; theorem  [ t : nonsnaking ] covers the results of this section .",
    "in section  [ s : numver ] we verify numerically hypothesis  [ h : ptoe2 ] , the main snaking assumption , in the laser model .",
    "we consider a smooth family of differential equations @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a closed rectangle with @xmath71 ; @xmath72 , @xmath73 are closed intervals .",
    "we assume the following    [ h : general ]    @xmath74 ; the equilibrium @xmath75 is hyperbolic , and @xmath76 , @xmath77 .    for all @xmath78",
    "there is a hyperbolic periodic orbit @xmath1 .",

    "the constant minimal period can always be achieved by an appropriate time transformation .",
    "the interval @xmath34 is maximal in the sense that for @xmath84 and @xmath85 or @xmath86 there in no complete cycle .",
    "more precisely with our choice of dimensions , typically the etop connection is of codimension - one  that means it appears along a curve in parameter space .",
    "this curve is the @xmath56-axis and the connection splits up when moving off the @xmath56-axis . on the other hand ,",
    "the ptoe connection is typically robust .",
    "nevertheless , by changing parameters within a wider range this connection can disappear , for instance in the course of a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "these scenarios are made more precise by additional hypotheses below .",
    "the three - dimensional state space enforces that both nontrivial floquet multipliers of @xmath1 have the same sign , cf .",

    "however , in section  [ s : neg_floqu_mul ] we relaxe this hypothesis .    the following lemma can be seen as a motivation for our further considerations .",
    "roughly speaking , it says that under certain transversality conditions on each curve @xmath87 intersecting @xmath88 transversely , there is a sequence of parameter values accumulating at @xmath88 for which a one - homoclinic orbit to the equilibrium does exist , cf .",

    "in this section we show numerically that the assumptions stated in section  [ s : setup_res ] are satisfied for our motivating example  . recall that the setting of system   is exactly opposite to the setting described in the hypotheses in section  [ s : setup_res ] , i.e. @xmath451 , meaning that the orbit @xmath13 is of codimension one and the orbit @xmath7 is of codimension zero . in order to adapt the following numerical computations to the explanations given in the preceding sections we consider the vector field @xmath452 .",
    "further we define @xmath453 the statements of hypothesis  [ h : etop ] are trivially satisfied : as shown in  @xcite , the etop connection which exists for parameter values on @xmath26 , cf .",

    "it turns out that the roots of the test function are indeed regular , which means that hypothesis  [ h : etop ] is numerically satisfied .",
    "what is more , the way the computations are set up immediately provide the floquet multipliers of the periodic orbit , hence we can easily check that hypothesis  [ h : general ] is also satisfied ( see also below for the computation of the floquet multipliers ) . in the following we focus on the numerical verification of hypotheses  [ h : ptoe2 ] and  [ h : ptoe3 ] , which are not trivial to check .    in our further considerations",
    "we restrict ourselves to verify the shape of @xmath48 rather than to present a numerical verification of all requirements stated in hypotheses  [ h : ptoe1 ]    [ h : ptoe3 ] .",

    "the boundary value problems that are used for the consecutive continuation runs with auto are listed .",
    "note that the equilibrium point @xmath0 as well as its eigenspaces are analytically known and hence are omitted in this listing .    in order to compute the orbit segments , we need to continue several objects simultaneously .",
