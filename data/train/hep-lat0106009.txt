    "traditionally , only theories with hermitian hamiltonians are studied in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory .",

    "a major criticism of these theories is that a consistent probabilistic interpretation has not been formulated .",
    "this paper suggests that there is a real , fokker - planck probability underlying these theories and presents a numerical method for calculating the @xmath1-point green s functions , @xmath2 , of these theories .",
    "a @xmath0-symmetric lagrangian that has been studied in the past is defined by the euclidean lagrangian @xmath3 a recent paper used schwinger - dyson techniques to study this self - interacting scalar quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "green s functions , @xmath2 , calculated by this method agreed extremely well with known results .",
    "it was argued that these theories possess a positive definite spectrum and a nonvanishing value of @xmath4 for all @xmath5 .",

    "thus , @xmath13 is manifestly @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "it is believed that the reality and positivity of the spectra are a direct consequence of this @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the positivity of the spectra for all @xmath14 is an extremely surprising result ; it is not at all obvious , for example , that the lagrangian @xmath15 corresponding to @xmath16 and @xmath17 has a positive spectrum . to understand this and other results",

    "this surprising result shows that the theory is not parity symmetric even when @xmath14 is even .",
    "the violation of parity symmetry is a consequence of the manner in which the boundary conditions and path integral contours are defined .",

    "[ s4 ] contains concluding remarks concerning the implications of this study in regard to probability and completeness and proposes higher - dimensional @xmath0-symmetric theories to which this numerical method could be applied .",
    "since many @xmath0-symmetric theories possess a real positive spectrum and a nonvanishing value for @xmath38 , it has been speculated that @xmath0-symmetric theories could be used to describe a higgs boson .",
    "a @xmath41 theory is especially interesting as a theory for the higgs because it has a dimensionless coupling constant and is asymptotically free @xcite .",
    "however , the schwinger - dyson equations mentioned in sec .  [ s0 ]",
    "are too difficult to solve in four - dimensional space - time , where physical quantities must be calculated . hence , a reliable numerical method is needed to compute expectation values in higher dimensions . in this section we argue that monte carlo methods are ill suited for these theories , while the complex langevin equation provides a robust numerical technique .",
    "most often , monte carlo methods are used for numerical evaluations of expectation values like those in eq .",
    "( [ eq0.4 ] ) where the contour of integration is along the real axis and @xmath42 is real .",
    "this is achieved by choosing paths weighted according to the probability distribution , @xmath19 . for the hamiltonians considered in this paper ,",
    "@xmath42 is complex , and neither a real representation nor a consistent probabilistic interpretation is known .",
    "one approach to use monte carlo is to separate the hamiltonian into real and imaginary parts and consider @xmath43)$ ] the operator and @xmath44)$ ] the probability distribution .",
    "there are two problems with this approach .",
    "firstly , the size of @xmath45 $ ] increases with the size of the lattice , making the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq0.4 ] ) very small . consequently ,",
    "numerical simulations become very difficult .",
    "secondly , and more importantly , in many cases @xmath45 $ ] contains more information about which paths are important than @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the algorithm outlined above never samples the important paths and thus fails to converge to the correct answer .",
    "specific examples of this phenomenon are given in refs .",
    "our studies of zero - dimensional versions of eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) suggest that this is the case for non - hermitian but @xmath0-symmetric theories , and that monte carlo methods are inapplicable .",
    "another method for numerical calculations in quantum field theory involves the langevin equation @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an unphysical , langevin time , @xmath49 gives the equations of motion for the hamiltonian , and @xmath50 is a stochastic variable .",
    "the function @xmath50 is chosen to be a real , gaussian random function that satisfies the conditions @xmath51 where the averaging is performed with respect to the appropriately normalized gaussian probability distribution .",
    "further , it is well known that when @xmath42 is real , the probability distribution , @xmath52 , associated with eq .",
    "( [ eq1.3 ] ) is given by the fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath53 the space - time dependence of all variables and the @xmath48 dependence of @xmath54 and @xmath12 are left implicit in the above equations .",

    "it is easy to evolve eq .",
    "( [ eq1.3 ] ) numerically in langevin time , @xmath48 , and find expectation values",
    ". for real variables these expectation values are expressible as @xmath55 and one can show that @xmath56 hence , @xmath57 that is , when @xmath42 and @xmath12 are both real , the physical expectation values are recovered by taking the unphysical , langevin time to infinity    more generally , an analytically continued version of eq .",
    "( [ eq1.7 ] ) often holds as long as the supersymmetric fokker - planck hamiltonian , @xmath58 , formed by taking @xmath59 as the superpotential , has a spectrum with positive real part and a ground state that is nondegenerate  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath42 is complex , @xmath58 can still have a nondegenerate ground state and a spectrum that is real and positive . as explained in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] , these criteria are the correct ones to test for convergence of expectation values for the hamiltonians studied in this paper .",
    "this is also true for several other cases studied in refs .",
    "this method was successful in several cases including statistical mechanics problems with complex chemical potentials , field - theoretic calculations in minkowski space , simulations dealing with the many fermion problem  @xcite , and even non - hermitian hamiltonians with complex eigenvalues@xcite .",
    "the previous studies involving the complex langevin equation focused on cases where the physical hamiltonians were either hermitian , non - hermitian with a positive real part , or non - hermitian with a real part that was negative and an imaginary part that was small .",
    "these cases were studied because the associated fokker - planck hamiltonian , @xmath58 , had eigenvalues with a positive , real part . in contrast , @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians such as eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) often have a real part that is not strictly positive and an imaginary part that can not be considered small .",
    "however , in the cases we have studied , @xmath58 still possesses a spectrum that is purely real and positive .",
    "reference  @xcite demonstrates that the renormalized mass squared for the anharmonic oscillator , @xmath60 , is proportional to the first nonzero eigenvalue of the associated fokker - planck hamiltonian .",
    "this suggests that the positive real part of the spectrum of @xmath58 is a consequence of the purely real spectrum of these @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "for the zero - dimensional @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians studied in this paper , the eigenvalues of the associated @xmath58 are always positive and real .",
    "we believe that a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian with real , positive eigenvalues will always lead to a real positive part for the eigenvalues of @xmath58 . to prove this would be tantamount to finding the exact conditions necessary for a given @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian to possess a real spectrum , and that is an open problem . moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite and elsewhere , hermitian hamiltonians in minkowski space often lead to an associated @xmath58 that is non - hermitian .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0-symmetric , non - hermitian hamiltonians in this paper always lead to fokker - planck hamiltonians that maintain @xmath0 symmetry ; this is explained in sec .  [ s2 ] .",
    "to gain a deeper understanding of when the langevin equation works and of its connection to the hamiltonian being studied , we begin with the complex fokker - planck equation . allowing @xmath42 and @xmath12 to be complex , eq.([eq1.3 ] ) can be divided into its real and imaginary parts and written as two coupled equations . if one assumes the noise is purely real and uses the standard methods of stochastic calculus to derive ito s formula for two variables  @xcite , one is lead to the complex fokker - planck equation , @xmath61 + { \\partial\\over\\partial\\phi_i}im\\bigg[{\\partial s\\over\\partial\\phi}\\bigg]+{\\partial^2\\over\\partial\\phi_r^2 } \\right)p(\\phi_r,\\phi_i;\\tau)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\equiv o_{fp}(\\phi_r,\\phi_i)p(\\phi_r,\\phi_i;\\tau ) , \\label{eq1.8a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath12 respectively and @xmath64 .",
    "eq.([eq1.8a ] ) defines a purely real probability in the complex-@xmath12 plane , but apart from a few simple cases  @xcite , explicit constructions of @xmath65 are unknown .",
    "now that we are evolving the langevin equation in the complex plane , eq.([eq1.6 ] ) must be modified .",
    "the average over the langevin probability must be taken as an area integral in the complex plane given by @xmath66 notice that @xmath67 is an analytic function , but @xmath68 is not in general .",
    "understanding how eq.([eq1.7 ] ) and eq.([eq1.8 ] ) are satisfied is now much more complicated because in the limit @xmath69 one must show how an area integral becomes a path integral and that a real , nonanalytic function , @xmath68 , generates the complex , analytic function @xmath19 .",
    "this can be achieved in a formal manner by following the approach introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite .",

    "moreover , analytical calculations for these theories are most easily done along the contour where there is pure exponential damping defined by @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this contour is the dashed line in fig .",

    "this restriction also holds in one dimension for the initial configuration at @xmath158 .      in this section",
    "we apply the complex langevin method to massless versions of eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) in one dimension with @xmath40 and @xmath16 .",
    "the potentials are the same as those discussed in the last section , but now there is a second derivative in physical time , @xmath159 , present in all of the equations , and @xmath50 becomes @xmath11 dependent .",
    "thus , the eigenvalue problem for @xmath58 becomes a partial differential equation .",
    "the spectra of eigenvalue problems for @xmath0-symmetric partial differential equations has not been studied , and we do not have a proof that they are real .",
    "but , following the examples of zero - dimensional theories , we assume the spectrum of @xmath58 has a positive real part .",
    "the results of our simulations support this assumption .",
    "these one - dimensional theories are more computationally expensive because they give rise to langevin equations that are partial differential equations .",
    "consequently , the second - order algorithm in the last section is useful . for numerical simulations of one - dimensional theories",
    ", we have to introduce a physical time lattice and @xmath159 becomes @xmath160 where @xmath161 is an index for real time and @xmath162 is the spacing in physical time .",
    "the algorithms used in the previous section are applicable here as well , but their form has changed slightly .",
    "the algorithms now contain eq .",
    "( [ eq3.8 ] ) as part of @xmath163 and the explicit lattice dependence of @xmath164 is such that @xmath165 further , in these algorithms there is always an @xmath166 associated with eq .",
    "( [ eq3.8 ] ) , and thus , the simulation is unstable unless @xmath167 .",
    "however , there are no instabilities similar to those encountered for @xmath41 in the zero dimensional case . for fixed values of @xmath162 , we compute at various values of @xmath154 and take the limit @xmath153 , giving the expectation values as a function of @xmath162 . a typical fit for this process",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "we then take @xmath168 and obtain the expectation values in the continuum limit . a fit used to extrapolate the value of @xmath169 for the potential @xmath41",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "5 . in table  [ t2 ]",
    "the numerical results for the expectation values are compared with numerically integrated quantum - mechanical values given in ref .",
    "we have chosen @xmath170 such that eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) corresponds with the hamiltonians in ref .",
    "the agreement of our results with previous work is excellent .",
    "this paper and ref .",
    "@xcite have shown that @xmath0-symmetric theories are amenable to the methods of quantum field theory .",
    "the previously - used schwinger - dyson method is very accurate but is difficult to apply to higher - dimensional theories .",
    "here we show how a numerical method based on the complex langevin equation can be used to obtain precise results .",
    "we believe that this numerical method can be applied to higher - dimensional theories and plan to use it for future calculations .",
    "this work represents an important step towards a test of the physical applicability of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "an interesting implication of this study concerns the probability and completeness of @xmath0-symmetric theories .",
    "the argument for the success of the complex langevin method in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] crucially depends upon the eigenfunctions of @xmath58 being complete ( [ eq2.4 ] ) . similarly , extremely accurate results in ref .",
    "@xcite crucially depend on the completeness of @xmath0-symmetric eigenfunctions .",
    "the possible connection between the eigenvalues of the fokker - planck hamiltonians and the hamiltonians being simulated suggests a possible connection between the eigenfunctions as well . perhaps proving completeness for one of these sets of eigenfunctions would imply the completeness of the other set .",
    "perhaps the most important implication for @xmath0-symmetric theories is that there is an implicit probability distribution defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq1.8a ] ) and seen in fig .",
    "moreover , this study suggests that expectation values must be interpreted as area integrals of observables weighted by this real probability distribution .",
    "previous studies of the zeros of eigenfunctions of @xmath0-symmetric theories suggest that the zeros interlace and become dense in a narrow band in the complex-@xmath12 plane @xcite .",
    "hence , it was conjectured that completeness may have to be defined in terms of area integrals .",
    "we suspect a strong connection between the two results and speculate that a consistent probabilistic formulation of @xmath0-symmetric theories can only be achieved in terms of area integrals .",
    "a probabilistic interpretation of @xmath0-symmetric theories would be a major advance .",
    "a recent study of the complex langevin equation demonstrates that problems with convergence arise when expectation values are complex but the fixed points of the langevin equation lie on the real axis , and as a result , the field spends most of its time on the real axis and away from the correct average value  @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated there that this problem could be avoided by moving the fixed points into the complex plane . in the present study",
    "the expectation values are pure real or pure imaginary .",
    "the fixed point of the langevin equation is zero , which is on the real axis , but the simulations converged without moving the fixed point into the complex plane .",
    "this seems to be because the path of the deterministic equation ( @xmath171 ) is given by @xmath172^{{1\\over n-2 } } } , \\label{eq4.1a}\\ ] ] where @xmath173 is an arbitrary constant given by the initial condition .",
    "the field is attracted to the imaginary axis even though the fixed point is on the real axis .",
    "thus , it appears to be crucial that the deterministic path to or between the fixed points is in the complex plane , but not that the fixed points themselves lie in the complex plane .",
    "the simulations for @xmath0-symmetric theories work in a straightforward manner ; the fixed points do not need to be adjusted .",
    "we believe that the complex langevin equation works so nicely for @xmath0-symmetric theories because these theories are inherently complex . as a result",
    ", it seems that @xmath0-symmetric theories may provide a class of toy models with new and interesting properties that are especially well suited for probing the intricacies of the complex langevin equation .",
    "the most exciting proposed application of these non - hermitian theories is to higgs theories .",
    "we believe that the numerical method presented in this paper should allow one to compute the mass of the higgs particle in four - dimensional versions of these theories .",
    "before this can be done , however , renormalization must be thoroughly understood .",
    "studies of field theories in fewer than four physical dimensions represent a simpler alternative . in particular",
    ", exact results for the scaling exponents of an @xmath70 theory in two and three dimensions can be obtained by relating them to the lee - yang edge singularity in one and two dimensions respectively  @xcite .",
