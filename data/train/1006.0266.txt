    "both the static and dynamics properties of a josephson tunnel junction ( jtj ) are affected by the presence of an externally applied magnetic field . since the discovery of the josephson effect in 1962 ,",
    "the magnetic diffraction phenomena of the supercurrent and the occurrence of current singularities ( fiske steps ) due to resonant cavity modes have been studied under the assumption of an homogeneous magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is to overcome this textbook assumption and to investigate the consequences of enforcing asymmetric boundary conditions ( abc ) on rectangular jtjs having length @xmath0 along the @xmath5 axis , width @xmath6 along the @xmath7 axis and uniform critical current density @xmath8 .",
    "we assume the junctions to be one - dimensional , i.e. , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the josephson penetration depth@xcite ( where @xmath11 is the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath12 the effective junction magnetic penetration@xcite and @xmath13 the vacuum permeability ) .",
    "it is well known that , under these circumstances , the gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath14 of the order parameters of the superconductors on each side of the tunnel barrier obeys the static or d.c .",
    "perturbed sine - gordon equation@xcite :    @xmath15    in which the term @xmath16 is the distribution of the externally applied bias current @xmath17 ; choosing the @xmath5-axis origin in the center of the junction , @xmath18 . in normalized units of @xmath19 , eq.([sg ] ) becomes :    @xmath20    with such normalization the junction length is @xmath21 ; further , the josephson ( zero - voltage ) current @xmath22 through the barrier is obtained as the spatial average of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , while the total bias current @xmath25 is given by the spatial average of @xmath26 , @xmath27 . in this work",
    "we will consider two quite different symmetric bias current profiles : i ) uniform bias @xmath28 for which @xmath29 and ii ) @xmath4-shaped bias @xmath30 for which , being @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath4-biased jtjs in a uniform magnetic field have been the subject of a recent theoretical and experimental investigation@xcite . according to the magnetic josephson equation@xcite ,",
    "the boundary conditions for eq.([pde ] ) depend on the external field values at the junction extremities :    @xmath33    in which @xmath34 are the @xmath7-components @xmath35 of the applied magnetic field at the left and right junction ends , normalized to @xmath36 .",
    "classically one considers the case of a uniform field applied in the junction plane perpendicular to the long junction dimension @xmath0 , so that @xmath37 .",
    "we will refer to the above conditions as _ symmetric _ or classical boundary conditions to distinguish them from the _ asymmetric _ boundary conditions ( abc ) achieved when the magnetic fields at the junction extremities have the same amplitudes , but opposite directions , that is , @xmath38 .",
    "we will analyze the properties of abc later on ; for now we only remark that they reminds of the boundary conditions for an in - line symmetric junction@xcite with @xmath34 being the self - fields produced by the external current which enters the junction at one extremity and leaves at the opposite one .",
    "figs.1(a ) and ( b ) show two examples of how the abc could be realized in practical devices . in both cases",
    "the asymmetry is obtained by the current @xmath39 flowing in a properly designed control line .",
    "the control line technique has been widely and successfully used to produce local magnetic fields in josephson structures since 1994@xcite . in fig.1(a )",
    "the control line , separated from the junction by an insulating layer , runs aside the long dimension of an overlap - type planar jtj and flips sides in the center of the junction . in the second ,",
    "less easily achievable , case , sketched in fig.1(b ) , the control line is perpendicular to the junction plane and goes through a small hole drilled in the substrate in between the gap of a ring shaped jtj . in the former case the bias current density is uniform , while in the latter case the current distribution can be expressed in terms of a @xmath4-function@xcite .",
    "it is quite evident that abc are achieved in both electrode configurations .",
    "the abc have several important implications .",
    "we begin by computing the josephson current @xmath22 carried by the junction . from eq.([pde ] ) we easily get :    @xmath40 + i_b=\\frac{h_r - h_l}{l } + i_b .",
    "\\label{ij}\\ ] ]    with the classical boundary conditions , the first term of the right side of eq.([ij ] ) vanishes , so that @xmath41 .",
    "however , with abc we get :    @xmath42    i.e. , the zero - voltage current also depends on the amplitude of the asymmetric magnetic field . more precisely , the applied magnetic field acts as an extra field - dependent d.c .",
    "current source @xmath43 in parallel to the external current source @xmath44 . in real units",
    "the normalized current @xmath45 corresponds to a supercurrent @xmath46 proportional to the junction width @xmath6 ( e.g. , with @xmath47a / m and @xmath48 m , then @xmath49a ) .",
    "eq.([ij ] ) suggests that a planar jtj can be used as a magnetic first order gradiometer based on the readout of the current @xmath45 supplied by a stand - alone ( unbiased ) jtj .",
    "however , it should be realized that , since @xmath45 is a zero - voltage current , the internal impedance of the current source is null , so that no power can be delivered to an external resistive load .    from a mathematical point of view , the peculiarity of the abc is that , provided that the current distribution is symmetric @xmath50 , the solutions of eq.([pde ] ) have to be even functions , @xmath51 , meaning that the phase difference between the two junction extremities is always null : @xmath52 . as a consequence of the phase parity ,",
    "we could limit our analysis to the spatial range @xmath53 $ ] , with the condition in the origin to be found as follows . from eq.([pde ] ) , for any @xmath54 , we can write :    @xmath55    taking the limit @xmath56 , the first integral vanishes , since @xmath57 is a continuous function .",
    "if also the bias current density @xmath58 is continuous , then the second integral vanishes too , enforcing @xmath59 . being the phase derivative an odd function , @xmath60 , it vanishes in the origin :    @xmath61    however , this is no longer true when the bias profile is discontinuous . in the case of a @xmath4-shaped bias , eq.([jump0 ] ) leads to a discontinuity of the phase gradient in the origin@xcite : @xmath62 . exploiting again the symmetry property of the phase gradient",
    ", we have : @xmath63 and    @xmath64    to summarize , an overlap junction with abc obeys eq.([pde ] ) with the condition at @xmath65 as in eq.([bc ] ) :    @xmath66    and the condition in the origin given by eq.([bc0 ] ) or ( [ bc1 ] ) in the cases of continuous or @xmath4-shaped bias , respectively .",
    "since the phase profile of a junction with abc has to be even , then , for small junctions ( @xmath67 ) , we can use the trial function @xmath68 , with the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 to be determined from the boundary conditions and @xmath71 treated as an integration constant .",
    "we will consider separately the cases of uniform bias and that of a @xmath4-shaped bias profile@xcite . in the former case , in order to fulfill the condition in ( [ bc0 ] ) , then @xmath72 and , to satisfy ( [ bcl ] ) , @xmath73 , so that : @xmath74",
    ". the josephson current @xmath22 can be computed from the above quadratic expression :    @xmath75 , \\label{ij3}\\ ] ]    in which we have introduced fresnel s integrals defined by : @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the critical current @xmath79 can be found by maximizing ( [ ij3 ] ) with respect to @xmath71 . introducing the quantity @xmath80",
    ", we get a fresnel ( or near - field ) magnetic diffraction pattern :    @xmath81    with @xmath82 . in the limit @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 so that @xmath86 . in the opposite limit ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath87 , @xmath88 , so that @xmath89 .",
    "fig.2 shows the dependence of the critical current @xmath79 on the product @xmath90 ( that is independent on @xmath1 ) .    in the case of @xmath4-shaped bias , then , in order to satisfy the conditions in ( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bcl ] ) , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , so that : @xmath93 .",
    "when the modulus of the ratio @xmath94 is much smaller than unity , the quadratic term can be disregarded .",
    "@xmath95 means that @xmath96 , i.e. , the solution is piecewise linear :    @xmath97    eq.([db ] ) works well either for small junctions ( @xmath67 ) or near the pattern minima ( @xmath98 ) or for large field values ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the josephson current corresponding to eq.([db ] ) can be computed :    @xmath100 . \\label{ij4}\\ ] ]    the critical current @xmath101 can be found by maximizing ( [ ij4 ] ) with respect to @xmath71 , to give :    @xmath102    the integration constant is the sawtooth function :    @xmath103    in other words , for a small @xmath4-biased jtj with abc we expect a fraunhofer - like magnetic diffraction pattern with a field - periodicity twice larger than that of a small uniformly biased jtj in a uniform magnetic field @xmath104 , for which @xmath105 .",
    "eq.([pde ] ) with abc has been numerically integrated in order to find the magnetic diffraction patterns @xmath101 of jtjs having lengths larger that @xmath1 .",
    "the details of the numerical technique can be found in ref.@xcite together with the analogous results in the case of symmetric boundary conditions .",
    "figs.3(a)-(d ) show the numerically obtained @xmath101 for jtjs with abc having normalized lengths @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively : the full dots refer to the uniform bias , while the open dots correspond to the point injected current .",
    "note the very good agreement between the theoretical dependence of fig.2 and the result of the numerical simulations for @xmath108 shown by the dashed line of fig.3(a ) .",
    "the validity of eq.([ijj ] ) has been numerically checked both in the case of uniform bias and @xmath4-shaped bias . in the latter case , for @xmath108",
    ", the phase profile could be well approximated by @xmath109 for @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) and by eq.([db ] ) for @xmath112 [ with @xmath71 given by eq.([phidb ] ) ] .",
    "for @xmath113 the linear approximation is good for @xmath114 . generally speaking",
    ", it is observed that the magnetic diffraction patterns become more and more asymmetric as the junction normalized length increases .",
    "parenthetically , we note that what is measured in the experiments is the maximum bias current that by virtue of eq.([ij ] ) can be quite different from the critical current .",
    "this might explain why the effects of a non - perfectly uniform magnetic field have never been reported in the literature so far .",
    "an asymmetric magnetic field drastically modifies also the dynamics of a planar jtj .",
    "it is easy to see that the josephson phase parity does not allow the standing wave resonances leading to current singularities such as fiske and flux flow steps observed in presence of a uniform external field@xcite . in fact , the magnetic field with opposite directions at the junction ends forces a chain of fluxons entering on one side and a chain of antifluxons entering on the other side , with the total magnetic flux in the barrier being always null .",
    "furthermore , a small amplitude asymmetric field provides an asymmetric tuning of the average speed of one ( or more ) soliton shuttling back and forth along the junction , opposite to the symmetric tuning typical of a uniform field@xcite .",
    "in summary , it has been discussed how the magnetic properties of a planar josephson tunnel junction change when the textbook assumption of a perfectly homogeneous magnetic field is reverted into a fully asymmetric one . in the most general case",
    "when the magnetic field has different amplitudes at the junction extremities , due to the system non - linear nature , the problem can not be split in two subproblems with properly chosen symmetric and asymmetric boundary conditions , unless the conditions for linearizing the current - phase relationship occur@xcite .",
    "the experimental verification of our findings has been planned .",
