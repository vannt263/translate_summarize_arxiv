    "the observation and subsequent identification of some @xmath1-ray sources as low mass @xmath1-ray binaries ( lmxrbs ) , high mass @xmath1-ray binaries ( hmxrbs ) and cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) plays a crucial role in the study of collapsed objects since the physics that they involve is strictly related with the strong gravity regime .    as an example , cvs are binary systems constituted by a white dwarf primary star interacting with a secondary object whose spectral type may range from g to m classes .",
    "the secondary star funnels matter on the primary via the formation of a roche - lobe .",
    "moreover , how the accretion on the white dwarf occurs strongly depends on some key parameters as the magnetic field strength .",
    "in particular , a disk surrounding the white dwarf will form if the primary star presents a low magnetic field ( as it happens in the dwarf nova systems ) , while a mass stream appears in highly magnetized binaries as the so called polars . in the dwarf novae sample , the accreting material may trigger some _ outburst _ episodes on timescales ranging from weeks to months so that the typical brightness of the system increases of a few magnitudes ( see e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a detailed review of the cv properties can be found in @xcite .    in the last decade ,",
    "different micro - lensing programs as ogle and macho ( see e.g. @xcite , and @xcite ) monitored several directions in the sky in order to collect data and give proof of the existence of dark matter within the galaxy .",
    "these observational campaigns allowed also to identify several eruptive variables as cvs and many authors compiled detailed catalogues with the properties of the observed sources ( see e.g. @xcite , for the cvs identified in the macho database ) .",
    "the cataclysmic variables which are part of the dwarf novae sample are usually discovered looking for several observational features in the optical as well as in the uv band .",
    "however , it has been noted that the efficiency in the detection depends strongly on the amplitude of the outbursts ( and their separation in time ) so that observations in bands different than the optical and the ultraviolet ones are required to confirm the nature of these sources .",
    "hence , the @xmath1-ray emission coming from these source represents a powerful tool of investigation despite of the relatively low luminosity ( @xmath9 erg s@xmath6 , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) of dwarf novae . in this respect , _",
    "xmm_-newton ( @xcite ) thanks to its large effective area is suitable for this kind of search ( see e.g. @xcite for a detailed analysis of the first _",
    "xmm_-newton observation of a cataclysmic variable system ) .    here",
    ", we report on a @xmath10 ks _",
    "xmm_-newton observation of a dwarf nova candidate towards the galactic bulge .",
    "the target name , as given in the macho database , is macho 104.20906.960 and a detailed description of the source optical properties can be found in @xcite .",
    "the source observed by @xmath11-newton shows a light curve with a strong periodic behavior ( with a period of @xmath12 h ) .",
    "we estimate the @xmath1-ray flux of the observed dwarf nova to be @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 @xmath7 in the 0.3 - 10 kev .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "2 , we briefly report about the optical properties of the dwarf nova candidate . in sect . 3 and sect .",
    "4 , we give details on the data reduction and on the spectral and timing analysis conducted on macho 104.20906.960 , while in sect .",
    "5 we draw some conclusions aiming that a cross correlation search in different bands of this kind of sources is performed in the future .",
    "the macho project ( see @xcite and @xcite ) collected images of millions of stars in the direction of the galactic bulge and small and large magellanic clouds to detect micro - lensing events and trace the amount of baryonic dark matter distributed in the galaxy .",
    "because of the large amount of data collected in many years , thousand of eruptive variables as well as cvs were identified so that it was possible to compile rich catalogues with the main properties of each of the observed source . in particular , the discovery of @xmath13 new dwarf nova candidates was the main result of @xcite , to which we refer for more details about the characteristics of each of the newly discovered cv systems .",
    "the result of the analysis of @xcite is listed in their table 1 , and the light curves of all the identified dwarf nova candidates are given in their fig . 1 .    in the present work , we study the dwarf nova candidate labeled as macho 104.20906.960 that was serendedipitously observed in 2005 .",
    "the coordinates of the target are @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the following ,",
    "we briefly report the main results of the analysis conducted by @xcite .",
    "in particular , they found that the dwarf nova macho 104.20906.960 has a light curve with length @xmath16 days during which 4 outbursts were possibly observed .",
    "the source has a typical @xmath17 magnitude far from the outbursts of @xmath18 and a median color index @xmath19 .",
    "the magnitude at the maximum of the outburst increases of @xmath20 ( the outburst color amplitude being @xmath21 ) . in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , for completeness we give a dss field of view ( red band ) around macho 104.20906.960 ( @xmath22 ) . here",
    ", the red ring is centered on the macho database coordinates and has a radius of @xmath23 corresponding to the astrometric precision achieved by the macho experiment . in the same figure",
    "we also give a green ring ( with radius of @xmath24 ) and yellow ring ( with radius of @xmath23 ) centered on the source identified by _",
    "xmm_-newton and chandra , respectively ( for further details see section 3 ) .    as clearly stated by @xcite , when the catalogue of the dwarf novae candidates was compiled , it was not possible to find a @xmath1-ray counterpart of any of the newly discovered cvs .",
    "in fact , when the authors assumed a @xmath25 to @xmath26 ratio lower than 0.5 , they expected to have all the sources below the detection limit ( @xmath27 erg s@xmath6 @xmath7 ) of the rosat / pspc observations . hence , as the same authors suggested ( @xcite ) , @xmath1-ray observations of dwarf novae necessarily require more sensitive instruments as the chandra and _ xmm_-newton satellite .",
    "for this reason , in the next section , we will consider a deep _ xmm_-newton observation towards the identified dwarf nova candidate macho 104.20906.960 and use the chandra satellite and its better astrometric precision to confirm its nature as predicted by @xcite .",
    "@xmath28    here , we are reporting about a _ xmm _ observation conducted in the direction of the galactic bulge and the serendipitous discovery of the x - ray counterpart of the dwarf nova candidate macho 104.20906.960 .",
    "the field of view around the source was observed by _",
    "xmm_-newton in two occasions : in september 2005 ( observation i d 30480 ) with both the epic mos and pn cameras ( @xcite ) operating in the medium filter mode ( exposure time of @xmath29 ks ) and in october 2005 ( observation i d 30597 ) with the thin filter and for a scheduled observational time of @xmath30 ks . unfortunately , in the first observation , the source is close to the camera borders so that , in the following , we do not consider it in our analysis .",
    "the epic data files ( odfs ) were processed using the _ xmm_-science analysis system ( sas version @xmath31 ) .",
    "the raw data were processed using the latest available calibration constituent files .",
    "we ran the _ emchain _ and _ epchain _ tools and obtained several event list files on which the usual screening criteria were applied .",
    "thus , after we searched and rejected periods affected by soft protons flares the remaining good time intervals resulted in exposures with effective time of @xmath32 ks , @xmath33 ks , and @xmath34 ks for mos 1 , mos 2 , and pn , respectively .    by using the",
    "_ edetect_chain _",
    "tool , the coordinates of the source macho 104.20906.960 were determined to be @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in this respect ,",
    "note that a systematic shift between the x - ray and optical position of the sources of @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( at a level of @xmath39 ) exists in right ascension for mos 1 and mos 2 .",
    "the shift on declination in the same two cameras is @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "for this reason , in the following we assume that the error associated to the two celestial coordinates is at least @xmath42 .    in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , we give a combined image ( in the band 0.2 - 10 kev ) of the mos 1 , mos 2 and pn cameras of the full _",
    "xmm_-newton field of view ( left panel ) .",
    "the deep exposure has shown the existence of several new @xmath1-ray sources - newton field of view was also particular interesting because of the discovery of the long parallax microlensing event macho-96-blg-5 ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the event parameters , and @xcite for an @xmath1-ray search for the lens ) . ] ( as the bright source at the up - right corner which was recently identified as a m - type x - ray binary with a 494s - pulse period neutron star , @xcite ) which will be investigated elsewhere .",
    "on the right panel , the dwarf nova candidate studied in the present paper is indicated by the red circle ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the _ chandra _ satellite has a better angular resolution ( @xmath44 , see @xcite for details ) than the @xmath11-newton telescope and therefore it is worth using _",
    "chandra _ to improve the x - ray astrometry and remove any doubt that the source studied here is the @xmath1-ray counterpart of the dwarf nova found in the macho catalogue .",
    "the chandra satellite observed toward the target in 2003 ( observation i d 3789 ) with the acis - s camera and for @xmath29 ks .",
    "we created images in the full 0.3 - 8 kev band and search for discrete sources by the ciao _ celldetect _ tool with a threshold signal - to - noise detection value of @xmath45 .",
    "this resulted in the identification of a source ( with signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath46 ) with coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath48 and astrometric precision of @xmath44 .    the green and yellow rings in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] are centered on the _ xmm_-newton and chandra source coordinates and have a radius corresponding to the astrometric precision of each satellite , respectively .",
    "hence , we believe that the @xmath11-newton identified source corresponds to the @xmath1-ray counterpart of the dwarf nova candidate macho 104.20906.960 detected by @xcite .      the source spectra were extracted in a circular region centered on the nominal position of the target in the three epic cameras ( extraction circles with radius @xmath49 ) , while the background spectra were accumulated in circular regions on the same chip and at the same vertical location .",
    "the resulting spectra were rebinned to have at least 25 counts per energy bin .",
    "the spectra were simultaneously fitted with xspec ( version 12.4.0 ) .",
    "a single temperature thermal plasma model with absorption by neutral gas ( mekal and wabs models in xspec ) gave a fit with @xmath50 ( 144 d.o.f . ) with temperature @xmath51 kev and a hydrogen column density @xmath52 @xmath7 .",
    "the normalization of this component is @xmath53 . adding a second thermal plasma model yielded a significantly better fit ( @xmath54 , for 142 d.o.f . ) with values of the temperature @xmath55 kev and @xmath56 kev .",
    "the fitted hydrogen column density @xmath7 , @xcite ) . ] is @xmath57 @xmath7 .",
    "the normalizations corresponding to the two components are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the addition of a third thermal plasma component or a blackbody one did not improve the fit in a significant way . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , we show the mos 1 , mos 2 , and pn spectra ( @xmath60 kev ) for the source and the respective best fits . the absorbed flux in the 0.3 - 10 kev is @xmath61 erg s@xmath6 @xmath7 corresponding to a corrected ( unabsorbed ) flux ( in the same band ) of @xmath62 erg s@xmath6 @xmath7 ( all the errors are quoted at the @xmath63 confidence level )    the source count rate detected by the chandra satellite during the 2003 observation corresponded to @xmath64 counts / sec . in spite of the fact that the count rate is slightly low",
    ", we extracted the spectrum from a circular aperture centered on the source and , once imported within xspec , we fitted it by using the same best fit model obtained with the _",
    "xmm_-newton data .",
    "after extrapolating the flux in the @xmath60 kev band we got that the chandra absorbed flux is @xmath65 erg s@xmath6 @xmath7 , i.e. consistent with the result obtained by using _ xmm_-newton and quoted above .",
    "we extracted the light curves of the source from all the three epic cameras using apertures @xmath49 in radius and centered on the macho 104.20906.960 position .",
    "the background light curves were extracted from the same ccd where the source was detected , scaled and subtracted from the source light curves . to increase the signal to noise ratio , the counts from the mos 1 , mos 2 and pn cameras were summed .",
    "we repeated the entire process for the energy range 0.2 - 10 kev ( to search for any periodicity in the full light curve ) and for the ranges @xmath66 kev and @xmath67 kev to evaluate the hardness ratio light curve in the two above energy bands and search for any change in the source state ( see next ) .",
    "the 0.2 - 10 kev light curve of macho 104.20906.960 during the 100 ks observation is given in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] as binned at @xmath68s .",
    "we searched for periodicity between 20 sec and @xmath69h , and found a periodic signal at @xmath70h using a lomb - scargle periodogram ( @xcite ) .",
    "the confidence level of our detection was estimated with monte carlo simulations assuming a null hypothesis of white noise , and the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , with the 68% , 90% , and 99% confidence levels represented by the full , dotted and dashed horizontal lines , respectively .",
    "we found that the @xmath70h period is significant at a confidence level @xmath71 ( see @xcite for more details on the applied technique ) .",
    "thus , at 3@xmath3 confidence level , the detected period of the observed source is @xmath2 h. assuming that the @xmath1-ray emission comes from the boundary layer ( where the @xmath1-ray emission is produced , see @xcite for a review ) , the period estimated above is consistent with the typical dwarf nova orbital period . the xmm light curve folded at the detected period of @xmath70h is shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] .    using the light curve extracted in the soft ( _ s _ ) and hard ( _ h _ ) parts of the spectrum ( as described above ) , we defined the usual hardness ratio @xmath72 and built the corresponding hardness ratio light curve to search for variability in the state of the source .",
    "the hardness ratio light curve is given in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] . here , the solid horizontal line represents the value of the average hardness ratio , while the almost superimposed dashed line is the result of a linear fit to the binned data , clearly showing that the state of the source remains constant ( i.e. without overall significant changes ) during the observation , as it would be expected since we observed the source during its quiescent state ( i.e. far from an outburst ) .",
    "in the present work , we studied the @xmath1-ray counterpart of the dwarf nova candidate labeled as macho 104.20906.960 .",
    "a two temperature thermal plasma model with absorption by neutral gas ( mekal and wabs models in xspec ) gave an acceptable fit with values of the temperature @xmath55 kev and @xmath56 kev .",
    "the fitted hydrogen column density is @xmath73 @xmath7 @xmath7 and the corrected ( unabsorbed ) flux resulted to be @xmath74 erg @xmath7 s@xmath6 , all the errors being at the @xmath63 confidence level .",
    "we found a periodicity of @xmath2 h in the source light curve by using a lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "if the @xmath1-ray measured hydrogen column density ( @xmath75 @xmath7 ) is entirely due to interstellar extinction , then using the standard @xmath76 relation ( see e.g. @xcite ) , one has @xmath77 , being this un upper limit to the extinction since many dwarf novae show evidence for intrinsic @xmath1-ray absorbtion . hence , we estimate the unabsorbed @xmath17 magnitude of the source to be @xmath78    one of the typical indicator used in the study of cv systems is the ratio between the @xmath1-ray and optical flux , i.e. @xmath79 . in this case , from the above estimated @xmath17 magnitude the optical flux can be readily obtained to be @xmath80 erg @xmath7 s@xmath6 and , by using the measured @xmath1-ray corrected flux , one obtains @xmath81 which is a typical value for a non - magnetic cv ( for which it is expected to have @xmath82 in the range @xmath83 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that macho 104.20906.960 is a dwarf nova ( non - magnetic ) system ( as first pointed out by @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that for dwarf novae a relation between the absolute magnitude in the v band at the outburst and the orbital period exists ( see @xcite for details ) , i.e. @xmath84 in the case of macho 104.20906.960 , the dereddend burst apparent magnitude ( @xmath85 ) and the outburst absolute magnitude ( @xmath86 , as given by the previous equation once @xmath87 is known ) read out to be @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively , so that the distance to the source can be easily determined to be approximately @xmath90 pc .",
    "hence , assuming isotropic emission , the @xmath1-ray luminosity of the source ( in the @xmath60 kev band ) can be derived as @xmath91 obtaining @xmath8 erg s@xmath6 , again typical for a dwarf nova ( se e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that long term campaigns , as the past ogle ( @xcite ) and macho ( @xcite ) experiments , are particularly attractive due to their capability of monitoring several million of stars for long time .",
    "these observational campaigns , among the other results , allowed the identification of several variable sources as cvs so that more studies based on an enhanced statistic may be performed . of course , thanks to the nature of many of these sources ( interacting binary systems ) , one can get more information if a multi - wavelength search ( spanning from the optical to the x - ray band ) is done as in the case of macho 104.20906.960 whose nature is confirmed by _",
    "xmm_-newton data .",
    "we suggest that a cross correlation search in different bands for this kind of sources is performed in the future ."
