    "neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath7 ) decay ( see the recent reviews @xcite and references therein ) is a rare nuclear transition which plays a unique role in testing lepton number conservation and in understanding fundamental neutrino properties .",
    "it consists in the transformation of an even - even nucleus into a lighter isobar containing two more protons and accompanied by the emission of two electrons and no other particles . since the total lepton number changes by two units , @xmath7 decay is forbidden in the standard model , but foreseen in many of its extensions , which explain naturally the smallness of the neutrino masses .",
    "an observation of this rare process would establish that neutrinos are majorana particles , i.e. the only fermions that coincide with their own antiparticles .",
    "the @xmath7 decay may be induced by a plethora of mechanisms . among them ,",
    "the so - called mass mechanism  consisting in the exchange of a virtual light majorana neutrino  occupies a special place , since its possible occurrence is directly related to the non - zero values of neutrino masses suggested by neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "the @xmath7 decay distinctive signal is a monochromatic peak in the sum energy spectrum of the two emitted electrons at the @xmath8-value of the transition .",
    "given the long expected lifetime of the @xmath7 process ( @xmath9  y ) , searching for it requires large sources , containing tens or hundreds of kg of the isotope of interest .",
    "desirable detector features are high energy resolution and efficiency , and as low as possible ( ideally zero ) background .",
    "the choice of the nucleus to be studied is an essential element too . among tens of possible candidates ,",
    "the isotope @xmath5mo is one of the most promising because of its high transition energy ( @xmath10  kev  @xcite ) , reasonable natural isotopic abundance ( @xmath11  %  @xcite ) , and favorable theoretical predictions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "last but not least , molybdenum enrichment in the isotope @xmath5mo can be done at a reasonable price and throughput  @xcite .",
    "the most stringent half - life limit on the @xmath7 decay of @xmath5mo was set by the nemo3 collaboration at @xmath12   at 90% confidence level  @xcite .",

    ".    there are several inorganic crystal scintillators containing molybdenum ( molybdates ) that can be used in principle as a basic element for a scintillating bolometer embedding @xmath5mo .",

    "however , cdmoo@xmath1 contains the @xmath6  active @xmath13cd , which has also a very high cross section for thermal neutron capture .",
    "a potential disadvantage of pbmoo@xmath1 is that @xmath5mo would be only 27% of the total mass .",
    "for this reason , the research has focused so far on the first two compounds .",
    "scintillating bolometers of camoo@xmath1 ( enriched in @xmath5mo and depleted in the radioactive @xmath14ca ) have been successfully developed within the amore collaboration  @xcite , while an intense activity on znmoo@xmath1 is ongoing in the lumineu and lucifer experiments with remarkable results  @xcite , including enriched zn@xmath5moo@xmath1 detectors  @xcite .",
    "this paper concerns the extremely promising results achieved with a lithium molybdate ( li@xmath0moo@xmath1 ) scintillating bolometer of remarkable volume ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) .",
    "important advantages of li@xmath0moo@xmath1 in comparison to other molybdate crystal scintillators are the highest concentration of molybdenum ( 55.2% in weight ) , absence of natural long - living radioactive isotopes ( as @xmath6  active @xmath17pb in pbmoo@xmath1 , @xmath18  active @xmath14ca in camoo@xmath1 , @xmath6  active @xmath13cd and @xmath18  active @xmath19cd in cdmoo@xmath1 ) , and comparatively easy crystal growth process .",
    "however , initial tests showed a low light yield . in this paper",
    ", we confirmed that the scintillation efficiency is the lowest among all the aforementioned molybdates , but that a well - performing light detector can provide anyway an excellent separation between @xmath6-like and @xmath4 events , at the level required for a high sensitive @xmath7 decay search .",

    "the aboveground cryogenic test has allowed also to estimate preliminarily the radiopurity level of the crystal and to ascertain that li@xmath0moo@xmath1 scintillating bolometers are excellent instruments for neutron detection thanks to the exothermic @xmath21li(n , t)@xmath4 reaction ( @xmath22  mev ) .",
    "deeply purified molybdenum oxide ( moo@xmath23 ) @xcite and commercial high purity lithium carbonate ( li@xmath0co@xmath23 , 99.99% ) were used to prepare li@xmath0moo@xmath1 melt for crystal growth .",

    "the temperature gradient was kept at the level of @xmath29 k / cm , which is one - two orders of magnitude lower in comparison to the conventional czochralski method .",
    "thanks to the low temperature gradient ( and therefore absence of intensive evaporation of molybdenum oxide from the melt ) , the losses of the initial material did not exceed the level of 0.5% of the initial charge .",
    "this result is crucially important in view of the utilization of costly enriched material .",
    "output of crystal boules was at the level of up to 70% of the initial charge .",

    "the luminescence of the znmoo@xmath1 crystal sample ( @xmath35 mm ) was investigated as a function of temperature between 8 k and 290 k under x - ray excitation .",
    "the sample was irradiated by x - rays from a tube with a rhenium anode ( 20 kv , 20 ma ) .",
    "light from the crystal was detected in the visible region by a feu-106 photomultiplier ( sensitive in the wide wavelength region of @xmath36 nm ) and in the near infrared region by a feu-83 photomultiplier ( with enhanced sensitivity in the near infrared wavelength region of @xmath37 nm , with cooled photocathode ) .",

    "neutron capture on @xmath89li , the dominant isotope in natural lithium with an abundance of 92.5% , produces the @xmath6-active isotope @xmath90li through an ( n,@xmath58 ) reaction with a cross section of 45.4 mbarn for thermal neutrons  @xcite .",
    "the emitted @xmath58 has an energy of 2.03 mev and has therefore a good chance to escape a li@xmath0moo@xmath1 crystal with a volume of the order of @xmath91  @xmath16 ( typical for single bolometric modules in @xmath7 decay search ) .",
    "the following @xmath90li @xmath6-decay ( @xmath92  ms  @xcite ) has a @xmath8-value of 16.0  mev and it can thus populate the region of interest of @xmath7 decay of @xmath5mo .",
    "however , the @xmath90li decay occurs through a broad ( @xmath93 = 1.5 mev ) @xmath90be excited state at @xmath77  mev which disintegrates promptly into two @xmath4 particles  @xcite",
    ". the absorbed @xmath6 electron and @xmath4 particles , produced simultaneously within the detector time response , will give rise to single heat and light pulses .",
    "therefore , the position of these @xmath4/@xmath6 mixed events in the heat - light scatter plot will be below the @xmath6 band , where the signal is searched for , allowing for the rejection of this potential background .",

    ". the luminescence monotonically increases by a factor 5 with cooling from room to liquid helium temperature .",
    "phosphorescence and intensive thermo - stimulated luminescence evidence the presence of traps due to defects in the crystal .",

    "a few - day low - temperature test of a scintillating bolometer based on a li@xmath0moo@xmath1 cylindrical crystal  with a size of @xmath2  mm  was performed at @xmath3  mk in an aboveground pulse - tube cryostat housing a high - power dilution refrigerator in csnsm ( orsay , france ) .",
    "the measurements demonstrated an excellent performance of the detector in terms of energy resolution and @xmath4/@xmath6 separation power .",
    "the size of the scintillating bolometer is at least 5 times higher than that of any previously operated device based on li@xmath0moo@xmath1 and it is not far from the volume required for the single module of a large array to be used in a competitive @xmath7 decay experiment .",
    "there are also positive  even though very preliminary  indications of a good radiopurity of the tested sample .",
    "a clear thermal neutron capture peak was observed from @xmath21li(n , t)@xmath4 reaction .",
