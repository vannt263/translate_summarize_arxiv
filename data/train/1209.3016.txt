    "over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have had a profound influence on the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "some of the most compelling evidence is based on computational simulations and theoretical models , which have shown that agns can suppress or shut down star formation by heating , or removing , the cold gas in their host galaxies ( e.g. , ) .",
    "while there is some indirect observational support for the suppression of star formation by agn activity ( see @xcite and @xcite for general reviews ) , we currently lack conclusive observational evidence across the overall population .",
    "one approach to assess the influence of agns on the growth of galaxies is to explore possible connections between agn activity and star formation .",
    "a large suite of studies have investigated the relationship between agn activity and star formation out to high redshifts ( @xmath12 ) , using deep x - ray and infrared data to constrain the agn activity and star formation rates ( sfrs ) , respectively ( ) .",
    "these studies have shown that the mean sfrs of moderate - luminosity agns ( @xmath0@xmath13@xmath2@xmath3 ) out to @xmath14  3 are comparable to those of co - eval star - forming galaxies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . however , while these studies find broadly similar results for the average sfrs of moderate - luminosity agns , the picture for luminous agns ( @xmath0@xmath15@xmath3 ) is less clear , with the majority of these studies arguing that the mean sfr either rises or remains flat towards the highest luminosities ( e.g. ,  ) .",
    "recently , @xcite used _",
    "chandra _ x - ray and _ herschel_-spire submillimeter data in the _ chandra _ deep field - north ( cdf - n ) to report that the mean sfrs of luminous agns ( @xmath0@xmath15@xmath3 ) at @xmath14  13 are significantly lower than those of moderate - luminosity agns .",
    "the implications of this study are potentially very significant as they imply a direct , empirical connection between luminous agn activity and the suppression of star formation .",
    "however , these results are in disagreement with other studies , many of which also used _ herschel _ data in similarly deep fields ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the aim of this letter is to extend the @xcite study using _",
    "herschel_-spire 250@xmath6  data in the wider - area cosmos field , improving the source statistics for @xmath0@xmath15@xmath3  agns by an order of magnitude . indeed , a clear limitation of the @xcite study was the small number of sources in the @xmath0@xmath15@xmath3  bins ( @xmath5  714 objects ) .",
    "we note that our letter only explores the mean sfrs using stacking analysis and does not explore the individual detection rates ( i.e. , figure  1 of @xcite ) ; however , significant differences in the detection fractions should lead to differences in the mean sfrs .",
    "we also repeat our analysis using _",
    "250@xmath6  data in the cdf - n and _ chandra _ deep field south ( cdf - s ) fields to explore the effect of using smaller fields . in our analysis",
    "we use @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and assume a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "our samples of agns are x - ray selected and cover a broad range of luminosities ( @xmath0@xmath19@xmath3 ) over the redshift range @xmath20 ( see figure  [ fig : lvz ] ) .",
    "we use the cdf - n ( @xcite ) , cdf - s ( @xcite ) and cosmos ( @xcite ) agn samples to obtain statistically meaningful numbers of agns in key @xmath0  ranges .",
    "redshifts for the cdf - n and cdf - s samples were taken from bauer et  al . in prep . and @xcite , respectively .",
    "redshifts for the cosmos sample were taken from @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we include both photometric and spectroscopic redshifts , which comprise @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the combined samples respectively ; however , we note that our conclusions do not change if we only consider spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "following @xcite we derive the rest - frame observed ( i.e. , not absorption - corrected ) 28  kev luminosity ( @xmath0 ) of agns in each field using @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the observed x - ray flux ( factor of @xmath50.85 correction ) . ]",
    "( 28  kev ) , @xmath25 is the luminosity distance , @xmath4 is the redshift and @xmath26 is the spectral index used for @xmath27-corrections ( we assume @xmath28 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lvz ] we show @xmath29 versus redshift for the x - ray agns in each of these fields .",
    "these three samples are highly complimentary ; the ultra - deep cdf - n and cdf - s samples provide large numbers of moderate luminosity agns at @xmath20 ( i.e. , @xmath0@xmath30@xmath3 ) while the shallower , wider - area cosmos survey populates the high - luminosity ( @xmath31@xmath3 ) portion of the parameter space largely missed by these small area surveys .     for details ) versus redshift .",
    "the areas of parameter space used in our stacking procedures ( see figure  [ fig : final ] ) are illustrated with the dashed lines .",
    "caution should be taken when interpreting the lowest x - ray luminosity bin ( @xmath0=10@xmath3210@xmath33ergs@xmath11 ) as it is incomplete at @xmath4@xmath342 . ]     for details .",
    "we find excellent agreement between our mean sfrs and those of @xcite across all @xmath0  bins ; we indicate the number of sources in each bin ( the differences in the number of objects between our study and @xcite are due to differences in the redshift catalogs ) .",
    "we note that for @xcite the values were extracted directly from their figures as tabulated values were unavailable . as with @xcite , we do not measure a significant flux in the highest @xmath0  bin for which we also include the 95th percentile limit ( see  [ measuring ] ) .",

    "are described in @xcite .",
    "we note that our results derived from the goods-_h _ cdf - n observations are consistent with those derived from the hermes observations of the same field .",
    "to determine the mean sfrs of agns as a function of @xmath0  we split our samples into a number of @xmath0  bins ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the majority of the x - ray agns are not individually detected by _",
    "herschel_-spire ( e.g. , @xcite ) and therefore , we rely on stacking analysis to obtain the mean 250@xmath6  fluxes of our agn samples in each bin .",
    "we stack at the optical positions of all x - ray agns in our samples , whether they are individually 250@xmath6-detected or not ( following @xcite ) .",
    "the point - spread function ( psf ) of the spire 250@xmath6  science images is normalized to 1 and in units of mjy beam@xmath11 , such that the mean 250@xmath6  flux was taken to be the central pixel value of each stacked image .    to determine if the measured fluxes from our stacked images are significantly above the background we employed a monte - carlo approach , which quantifies the level of background and confusion noise ( i.e. , flux contribution to our stacked images from nearby , unassociated sources )",
    "first , along with each `` true '' stacked image we also made 10,000 `` random '' stacks , stacking the same number of random positions around the field as in our true stacks .",
    "the mean flux of the random stacks was subtracted from that of the true stack , effectively removing any systematic contribution from the background or confusion .",
    "second , we compare our measured `` corrected '' fluxes of our true stacks to the distribution of fluxes from our random stacks . we consider a stacked signal to be significant if the flux is greater than the flux of 95%  of the random trials . following this criterion ,",
    "all but one of our stacked images have flux measurements that are significant ( see  [ results ] for details ) .",
    "we note that this method of randomly choosing positions to estimate the background does not take into account any clustering between x - ray agns and ir - sources ( this was also not considered in @xcite ) .",
    "while this will not affect the sfr-@xmath0  trends , the mean background subtracted from each stacked image may be slightly under - estimated , resulting in the absolute mean sfrs quoted being slightly over - estimated .",
    "however , we note that our results are consistent with studies that are less affected by confusion noise ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , giving confidence in our procedures .",
    "we used the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) library of @xcite to convert mean 250@xmath6  fluxes from our stacked images to mean integrated 81000@xmath6  infrared luminosities ( @xmath89 ) , selecting a redshifted @xcite sed on the basis of the monochromatic luminosity probed by the 250@xmath6  waveband .",
    "these mean @xmath89  values were converted to mean sfrs using @xcite . in the redshift range @xmath4=13 investigated here , the observed 250@xmath6  fluxes correspond to the peak of the seds in the rest frame .",
    "as such the @xmath90 to @xmath91 correction factors do not vary much as a function of sed shape when compared to using shorter wavelengths ( see figure  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , when we compared _ all _ of the @xcite seds , redshifted to @xmath4=2 , the conversion factors were consistent within @xmath520% ; we also repeated our analysis using the main - sequence sed from @xcite for all of the bins and found no significant difference .",
    "while the choice of sed adds a small additional uncertainty in the measured sfrs ( such that quoted absolute sfrs should be used with care ) , all of the observed trends , and hence the main conclusions of this letter , remain unaffected .",
    "we also show in  [ results ] that we reproduce the results of @xcite , providing further confidence in our approach .",
    "upper and lower limits on the mean sfrs for each of our @xmath0  bins were calculated using a bootstrapping technique , therefore taking into account the distribution of sfrs in each stack .",
    "we randomly subsample ( with replacement ) the agns in each of our bins , restack and recalculate the mean sfr .",
    "we did this 10,000 times for each bin to produce a distribution of mean sfrs . the quoted upper and lower limits on the mean sfrs correspond to the 16th and 84th percentiles ( i.e. , incorporating 68% , or @xmath92 ) of this distribution ( table  1 ) .",
    "we first stacked sub - samples of x - ray agns in the cdf - n . in an attempt to reproduce the results of @xcite we split the sample into the same luminosity bins used in their study ( table  [ table1 ] ) and only included agns with spectroscopic redshifts ; see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we find excellent agreement between our mean sfrs and those of @xcite ( i.e. , data points are consistent within their uncertainties ) , demonstrating the compatibility of the procedures used to derive these results . in agreement with @xcite",
    ", we do not obtain a significant flux measurement from the stacked 250@xmath6  image of our highest @xmath0  bin ( log@xmath93@xmath0/@xmath3@xmath94=44.33 - 44.80 $ ] ) .",
    "however , unlike @xcite , we find our upper limit is consistent with the mean sfrs of the lowest @xmath0  bins .",
    "the non - detection at fir wavelengths of the agns in our highest @xmath0bin in the cdf - n field , combined with the small numbers of agns in this bin ( 7 sources ) , clearly demonstrates the need for larger numbers of sources at high x - ray luminosities . to achieve this we performed the same stacking procedures using the cosmos survey .",
    "the inclusion of the cosmos agns means that the number of sources in our highest @xmath0  bins are now greater by an order of magnitude ( figure  [ fig : lvz ] and table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "as such , we can now place tighter constraints on the mean sfrs of high - luminosity agns . on the basis of our stacking analysis in the cosmos field",
    ", we find that the mean sfrs of agns with @xmath0@xmath15@xmath3  are consistent with those of @xmath0=@xmath7@xmath2@xmath3  agns ( @xmath5100200m@xmath10yr@xmath11 ; see figure  [ fig : final ] and table  1 ) .",
    "this implies that the mean sfr of @xmath4=13 agns is independent of x - ray luminosity ( although increases with increasing redshifts ) , in broad agreement with @xcite and indicates that the flat sfr distribution at @xmath0@xmath95@xmath3  ( e.g. , @xcite ) continues out to at least @xmath0@xmath96@xmath3 . and @xmath91 over _ all _ star - forming galaxies ( whether x - ray detected or not ) where a clear relationship between @xmath29 and sfr is found ( see @xcite ) .",
    "]    the results derived from our stacking of agns in the cosmos field may suggest that poor source statistics and potentially field  to  field variations ( i.e. , cosmic variance ) are at least partially responsible for the disagreement between the results from cosmos and cdf - n at high x - ray luminosities . to further investigate this we also stacked the spire data in the cdf - s field , which is of a similar size as the cdf - n and contains approximately the same number of high @xmath0  agns ( figure  [ fig : lvz ] ) .",
    "we also restack the cdf - n agns using the deeper 250  @xmath6  observations taken as part of the goods-_h _ program since this is of comparable depth to the hermes cdf - s observations .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : final ] , we find broad agreement between the mean sfrs of moderate luminosity agns ( i.e. , @xmath97@xmath3 ) in both fields : the mean sfrs with x - ray luminosity over the range @xmath98@xmath2@xmath3  are consistent with those expected from typical star - forming galaxies with the average redshifts and typical stellar masses observed for the agn host galaxies . the increasing specific sfrs with redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) is likely to drive the apparent increase in the mean sfrs between @xmath98@xmath7@xmath3and @xmath99@xmath2@xmath3(i.e .",
    ", they have different mean redshifts ) .",
    "in contrast to the lower x - ray luminosity systems , the mean sfrs of agns between cdf - n and cdf - s appears to diverge at the highest x - ray luminosities ( i.e. ,  @xmath100@xmath3 ) .",
    "we note that the higher mean sfr observed for high @xmath0  agns in the cdf - s is broadly consistent with the results found by @xcite and @xcite in the same field . despite these field  to  field variations the mean sfrs in the cdf - s and cdf - n fields are consistent with that found in the cosmos field ( within @xmath51@xmath101 and @xmath53@xmath101 respectively ) .",
    "we now consider if our main result indicates that luminous agn activity does not suppress star formation in the host galaxies .",
    "any _ observed _ change in the mean sfrs due to luminous agn activity will depend on the relative timescales of the process of shutting down star formation and of the luminous agn activity itself .",
    "for example , if the time between the onset of luminous agn activity and the shut down of star formation is longer than the agn lifetime ( which may in itself be highly variable ; e.g. , @xcite ) then it would be challenging to observe significantly reduced mean sfrs , simply on the basis of an x - ray luminosity threshold .",
    "a major uncertainty in providing a detailed assessment of possible connections between luminous agns and the suppression of star formation is due to the relative lifetimes of these processes .",
    "modeling suggests that episodes of the most luminous agn activity last @xmath5880myrs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) while studies based on black hole mass functions and agn luminosity functions imply that luminous agn activity could last in excess of @xmath510@xmath102 years ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations of agn - driven @xmath51000kms@xmath11 outflows , found over kilo - parsec scales in @xmath1413 ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xcite ) indicate that star - formation episodes could be rapidly shut down ; indeed , detailed studies of local ulirgs with agn - driven molecular outflows indicate that their gas reservoirs could be completely removed in @xmath5140myrs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . therefore , while to first order our results may appear to suggest that luminous agns do not suppress star formation , it is also possible that the timescales for luminous agn activity and the suppression of star - formation are comparable , meaning that any signatures of suppression would be very challenging to detect with the current data .",
    "clearer signatures of suppressed star formation may be more apparent when considering subsets of the agn population which may represent specific evolutionary stages ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    to summarize",
    ", we find no evidence for the significantly reduced mean sfrs among high luminosity agns , and the mean sfrs measured are consistent with that expected from typical star - forming galaxies at the average redshifts and typical stellar masses of our bins .",
    "we have suggested that depending on the timescales involved , it could be challenging to see the signature of suppressed star formation simply on the basis of an x - ray luminosity threshold .",
    "we acknowledge the stfc ( cmh ; dma ; adm and ams ) , the leverhulme trust ( jrm ) and nasa ( md and jk ) .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee , douglas scott and mat page for useful comments .",
