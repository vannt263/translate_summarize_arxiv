    "for a large class of models of quantum field theory there is a particular limit in which the theory may be analyzed exactly in the presence of instanton effects .",
    "the simplest are the ( twisted ) supersymmetric models , in which the path integral measure is defined in a straightforward way .",
    "classically , these models are described by first order lagrangians . the corresponding path integral localizes on certain finite - dimensional moduli spaces of classical ( instanton ) configurations .",
    "therefore in the path integral description the correlation functions of the corresponding quantum system are given by integrals over these moduli spaces .",
    "such correlation functions have been studied in the literature , but attention has been focused almost exclusively on the correlation functions of the _ bps observables _ , which represent cohomology of a supersymmetry charge of the theory .",
    "these correlation functions comprise the bps ( or topological ) sector of the model and give rise to important invariants , such as the gromov - witten and donaldson invariants ( in two and four dimensions , respectively ) . however , the knowledge of the topological sector is not sufficient for understanding the full quantum field theory .    in this paper",
    "we go beyond the topological field theory of these models and investigate the correlation functions of more general  non - bps , or `` off - shell ''  observables in the presence of instantons , i.e. , non - perturbatively .",
    "we show that in the special limit of the coupling constant that we are considering ( namely , @xmath0 , see below ) the quantum model may be analyzed and solved explicitly , both in the lagrangian ( or path integral ) formalism and the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "we describe the space of states of the quantum theory and show that a large class of observables ( satisfying certain analytic properties ) may be realized as operators acting on this space .",
    "their correlation functions are then represented by the matrix elements of these operators .",
    "these matrix elements agree with the path integral representation of the correlation functions ( given by integrals over the moduli spaces of instantons ) , and they also satisfy the usual identities , such as factorization over the intermediate states .",
    "we find some interesting and unexpected features in our models .",
    "one of them is the fact that the hamiltonian is _ non - diagonalizable _ on the space of states , but has jordan blocks .",
    "this leads to the appearance of logarithmic terms in the correlation functions .",
    "another feature is _ holomorphic factorization _ of the space of states in models defined on khler manifolds .",
    "in particular , we find that two - dimensional supersymmetric sigma models and four - dimensional super - yang - mills models are _ logarithmic conformal field theories _ in our limit .",
    "we begin by describing in more detail the class of models that will be discussed in this paper .",
    "these models appear in one , two and four space - time dimensions and are described by the actions which are written below ( note that all of our actions are written in euclidean signature ) .",
    "@xmath1 * 1d * : we start with the supersymmetric quantum mechanics on a compact khler manifold @xmath2 , with the khler metric @xmath3 , equipped with a holomorphic vector field @xmath4 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath4 comes from a holomorphic @xmath5-action on @xmath2 with a non - empty set of fixed points which are all isolated .",
    "we modify the standard action @xcite by adding the topological term @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the one - form obtained by contracting @xmath8 with the vector field @xmath9 ( our assumptions imply that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a morse function on @xmath2 ) .",
    "we allow @xmath12 to be complex .",
    "we then set @xmath13 ( note that they are not necessarily complex conjugate to each other because @xmath12 is complex ) .",
    "consider the limit in which @xmath14 , but @xmath15 is kept finite ( which means that @xmath16 and @xmath12 is adjusted accordingly , so that it has a large imaginary part ) . in this limit the model is described by the following first order action on a worldline @xmath17 : @xmath18 where the @xmath19 s are complex coordinates on @xmath2 and @xmath20 .",
    "the quantum model is described by the path integral @xmath21 over all maps @xmath22 .",
    "this path integral represents the `` delta - form '' supported on the moduli space of _ gradient trajectories _ , satisfying @xmath23 this is the instanton moduli space in this case .",
    "@xmath1 * 2d * : we start with the twisted ( type a ) @xmath24 supersymmetric sigma model with the target compact khler manifold @xmath2 with the khler metric @xmath3 and the @xmath25-field @xmath26 , which is a closed ( complex ) two - form on @xmath2 .",
    "we then set @xmath27 in the limit when @xmath28 , but the @xmath29 are kept finite ( which means that @xmath30 and the @xmath31 have a large imaginary part ) , this model is described by the following first order action on a worldsheet @xmath32 : @xmath33 thus , this model is a particular modification of the `` infinite radius limit '' , achieved by adding to the conventional second order action of the sigma model the topological term ( @xmath25-field ) with a large imaginary part .",
    "the path integral @xmath21 over all maps @xmath34 localizes on the moduli space of _ holomorphic maps _ , satisfying @xmath35    @xmath1 * 4d * : we start with twisted @xmath36 supersymmetric gauge theory on a four - manifold @xmath37 with compact gauge group @xmath38 , coupling constant @xmath39 and theta - angle @xmath12 , which we allow to be complex .",
    "we then set @xmath40 in the limit when @xmath41 , but @xmath15 is kept finite ( i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath12 has a large imaginary part ) , this model is described by the first order action @xmath43 this model is a particular modification of the `` weak coupling limit '' achieved by adding to the conventional second order the topological term @xmath44 , where @xmath12 has a large imaginary part .",
    "the path integral @xmath21 over all connections on @xmath37 localizes on the moduli space of _ anti - self dual connections _ satisfying the equations @xmath45    thus , to obtain these models we start with the standard ( second order ) action and add to it a _ topological term _ : @xmath46 in 1d , the b - field @xmath47 in 2d , and the @xmath12-angle term @xmath48 in 4d .",
    "we then allow @xmath12 and @xmath31 to be complex and take the limit @xmath49 as described above .- field , have been studied in the literature since the early days of the theory of instantons , see , e.g. , the papers @xcite and references therein ] in this limit the instanton contributions are present while the anti - instanton contributions vanish , and because of that the correlation functions simplify dramatically .",
    "the resulting models are described by the first order lagrangians written above . ]",
    "the corresponding path integral represents the `` delta - form '' supported on the instanton moduli space .",
    "this moduli space has components labeled by the appropriate `` instanton numbers '' , which are finite - dimensional ( after dividing by the appropriate gauge symmetry group ) .",
    "therefore the correlation functions are expressed in terms of integrals over these finite - dimensional components of the moduli space .",
    "when we move away from the special point @xmath50 ( with fixed @xmath15 ) , both instantons and anti - instantons start contributing to the correlation functions .",
    "the path integral becomes a mathai - quillen representative of the euler class of an appropriate vector bundle over the instanton moduli space , which is `` smeared '' around the moduli space of instantons ( like gaussian distribution ) , see , e.g. , @xcite . therefore general correlation functions are no longer represented by integrals over the finite - dimensional instanton moduli spaces and become much more complicated .",
    "there is however an important class of observables , called the _ bps observables _ whose correlation functions are independent of @xmath51 .",
    "they commute with the supersymmetry charge @xmath52 of the theory and comprise the _ topological sector _ of the theory .",
    "the perturbation away from the point @xmath50 ( that is back to a finite radius in 2d or to a non - zero coupling constant in 4d ) is given by a @xmath52-exact operator , and therefore the correlation functions of the bps observables ( which are @xmath52-closed ) remain unchanged when we move away from the special point .",
    "this is the secret of success of the computation of the correlation functions of the bps observables achieved in recent years in the framework of topological field theory : the computation is actually done in the theory at @xmath50 , but because of the special properties of the bps observables the answer remains the same for other values of the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "but for general observables the correlation functions do change in a rather complicated way when we move away from the special point .",
    "our goal in this paper is to go _ beyond the topological sector _ and consider more general correlation functions of non - bps observables .",
    "we are motivated , first of all , by the desire to understand non - supersymmetric quantum field theories with instantons .",
    "it is generally believed that realistic quantum field theories should be viewed as non - supersymmetric phases of supersymmetric ones .",
    "this means that the observables of the original theory may be realized as observables of a supersymmetric theory , but they are certainly not going to be bps observables . therefore we need to develop methods for computing correlation functions of such observables .    in particular ( and this was another motivation ) , developing this theory in two dimensions may help in elucidating the pure spinor approach to superstring theory @xcite , where `` curved @xmath53-systems '' play an important role @xcite .",
    "the third motivation comes from the realization that the correspondence between the full quantum field theory and its topological sector is analogous to the correspondence between a differential graded algebra ( dga ) and its cohomology .",
    "the cohomology certainly contains a lot of useful information about the dga , but far from all .",
    "for example , there are higher ( massey ) operations on the cohomologies , which can only be detected if we use the full dga structure .",
    "in particular , the cohomology of a manifold does not determine its geometric type , but the differential graded algebra of differential forms does ( at least , its rational homotopy type ) .",
    "likewise , we expect that the passage from the topological sector to the full quantum field theory will reveal a lot of additional information .",
    "in particular , while the correlation functions in the topological sector give rise to invariants of the underlying manifold , such as the gromov - witten and donaldson invariants , the correlation functions of the full quantum field theory may allow us to detect some finer information about its geometry .    since our goal now is to understand the full quantum field theory , and not just its topological sector , it is reasonable to try to describe the theory first at the special value of the coupling constant @xmath50 ( and finite @xmath15 ) , where the correlation functions simplify so dramatically due to the vanishing of the anti - instanton contributions .",
    "one can then try to extend these results to a neighborhood of this special value by perturbation theory .",
    "our approach should be contrasted with the standard perturbation theory approach to quantum field theory , which consists of expanding around a gaussian fixed point .",
    "this approach has many virtues , but it can not be universally applied . in particular",
    ", there are issues with the zero radius of convergence , but more importantly , such perturbation theory is unlikely to shed light on hard dynamical questions such as confinement .",
    "one can speculate that the reason for this is that expansion around a gaussian point does not adequately represent the non - linearity of the spaces of fields and symmetries",
    ".    the expansion around the point @xmath54 that we propose in this paper may be viewed as an alternative to the gaussian perturbation theory . here",
    "the topology ( and perhaps , even the geometry ) of the space of fields is captured by the appropriate moduli space of instantons .",
    "therefore this approach may be beneficial for understanding some of the questions that have proved to be notoriously difficult in the conventional formalism .",
    "we note that the consideration of the theory at @xmath50 has already proved to be very useful in the recent interpretation @xcite of mirror symmetry for toric varieties via an intermediate @xmath17-model and the recent proof @xcite of the seiberg - witten solution of the @xmath55 supersymmetric gauge theories .      before summarizing our results",
    "we wish to motivate them by pointing out some `` puzzles '' which naturally arise when one considers the models described above .",
    "it is natural to start with the one - dimensional case of supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "it already contains most of the salient features of the models that we are interested in , and yet is simple enough to allow us to analyze it explicitly .",
    "let us first look at the classical theory described by the action .",
    "we can include it into a one - parameter family of theories depending on a coupling constant @xmath56 by adding the term @xmath57 . for finite values of @xmath58 we may substitute the corresponding equations of motion and obtain the second order action @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "here @xmath11 is a morse function on @xmath2 , whose gradient is equal to @xmath61 , so that we have @xmath62 this function is also the hamiltonian of the @xmath63-vector field @xmath64 with respect to the khler structure . it is shown in @xcite that @xmath11 always exists under our assumption that @xmath4 comes from a holomorphic @xmath5-action on @xmath2 with a non - empty set of fixed points .    the term @xmath65 ( which plays the role of the @xmath25-field of the two - dimensional sigma model ) is very important , as we will see below .",
    "its role is to distinguish the instanton contributions to the path integral from the anti - instanton contributions .",
    "this allows us to keep the instantons and at the same time get rid of the anti - instantons in the limit @xmath66 with @xmath67 being fixed .    the limit @xmath41 with finite @xmath15 is achieved by taking @xmath68 and @xmath69 in such a way that @xmath70 is kept finite and fixed . for simplicity",
    "we will consider now the case when @xmath71 ( so that @xmath72 ) .",
    "we will therefore view the limit @xmath41 as the limit @xmath30 .    at finite values of @xmath56",
    "we have the theory with the action such that the classical hamiltonian is bounded from below .",
    "the corresponding quantum hamiltonian is conjugate to a second order differential operator equal to @xmath73 ( the witten laplacian @xcite ) acting on the hilbert space which is the completion of the de rham complex @xmath74 with respect to the @xmath75 norm .",
    "this hamiltonian has non - negative spectrum ( see section  [ recollections morse ] for more details ) .",
    "now consider the theory in the limit @xmath30 . here",
    "the classical hamiltonian corresponding to the action is not bounded from below , which seems to indicate trouble : unbounded spectrum of the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , the naive quantization of the hamiltonian is the first order operator @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 denotes the lie derivative ) . under our assumptions on the vector field @xmath4 ,",
    "the only smooth eigenstates are the constant functions .",
    "it is not clear at all how @xmath78 could possibly be realized as the hamiltonian of a quantum mechanical model .",
    "this constitutes the first puzzle that we encounter when analyzing the model ( and its higher dimensional analogues ) .",
    "the second puzzle has to do with holomorphic factorization .",
    "the action manifestly splits into the sum of holomorphic and anti - holomorphic terms ( unlike the action at @xmath79 , because the term @xmath80 is mixed ) .",
    "so naively one expects the same kind of holomorphic factorization for the space of states and for the correlation functions .",
    "however , the only globally defined holomorphic functions ( for compact @xmath2 ) are constants . there may also be some holomorphic differential forms , but only a finite - dimensional space of those .",
    "so it seems that a holomorphic factorization is impossible due to the absence of globally defined holomorphic differential forms .",
    "this makes us wonder that perhaps the structure of the space of states of the theory with the action should change when @xmath30 in such a way that the new space of states is the tensor product of chiral and anti - chiral sectors , the hamiltonian is diagonalizable and has bounded spectrum .",
    "in fact , we will show that this is `` almost '' true : the new space of states has the following structure @xmath81 ( where @xmath7 is the finite set of zeros of @xmath4 , or equivalently , critical points of the morse function @xmath11 ) , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 may be viewed as the chiral and anti - chiral blocks of the model .",
    "they have transparent geometric interpretation as spaces of `` delta - forms '' supported on the ascending manifolds of the morse function .",
    "we also find that the spectrum of the hamiltonian is non - negative , but the hamiltonian is not diagonalizable : it splits into a sum of jordan blocks ( of finite sizes bounded by @xmath84 ) .",
    "these are the phenomena typically associated with two - dimensional logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "it is quite curious that we observe these phenomena already at the level of quantum mechanics !",
    "we now explain our results in more detail , starting with the one - dimensional case .",
    "let @xmath2 be a compact khler manifold , equipped with a holomorphic vector field @xmath4 which comes from a holomorphic @xmath5-action @xmath85 on @xmath2 with isolated fixed points .",
    "let us denote those points by @xmath86 .",
    "we will assume that the set @xmath7 is non - empty ( it is necessarily finite ) .",
    "our first result concerns the structure of the spaces of states of the quantum theory with the action . under our assumptions , there is a _ bialynicki - birula decomposition _",
    "@xcite @xmath87 of @xmath2 into complex submanifolds @xmath88 , defined as follows : @xmath89 under the above assumptions it is proved in @xcite that there exists a morse function @xmath11 on @xmath2 , whose gradient is the vector field @xmath90 .",
    "the points @xmath86 , are the critical points of @xmath11 , and the submanifolds @xmath88 may be described as the `` ascending manifolds '' of @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , each submanifold @xmath88 is isomorphic to @xmath91 , where the index of the critical point @xmath92 is @xmath93 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in what follows we will assume that the above decomposition of @xmath2 is a stratification , that is the closure of each @xmath88 is a union of @xmath94 s .",
    "now let @xmath95 be the space of _ delta - forms supported on _ @xmath88 .",
    "an example of such delta - forms is the distribution ( or current ) on the space of differential forms on @xmath2 which is defined by the following formula : @xmath96 all other delta - forms supported on @xmath88 may be obtained by applying to @xmath97 differential operators defined on a small neighborhood of @xmath88 .",
    "the space @xmath95 is graded by the degree of the differential form .",
    "we then have a holomorphic factorization @xmath98 where @xmath99 ( resp .",
    "@xmath100 ) is the space of holomorphic ( resp .",
    ", anti - holomorphic ) delta - forms supported on @xmath88 .",
    "for example , if @xmath101 , so that @xmath102 is an open subset of @xmath2 , then @xmath82 is the space of differential forms on @xmath91 , and so it factorizes into the tensor product of holomorphic and anti - holomorphic differential forms . on the other hand , if @xmath103 , so that @xmath104 is a point , then @xmath82 is the space of distributions supported at @xmath92 .",
    "it factorizes into the tensor product of the derivatives with respect to holomorphic and anti - holomorphic vector fields . in the intermediate cases",
    "the space @xmath99 is generated from the delta - form @xmath97 supported on @xmath88 under the action of holomorphic differential forms along @xmath88 and holomorphic vector fields in the transversal directions .",
    "thus , @xmath99 is the space of global sections of a @xmath105-module , where @xmath105 is the sheaf of holomorphic differential operators on @xmath2 .",
    "now we set @xmath106 we claim that this space @xmath107 is isomorphic to the _ space of states _ of the quantum mechanical model described by the action .",
    "the reader may wonder how the space of states of the theory for finite @xmath56 described by the action , which is essentially the space of differential forms on @xmath2 , could possibly turn into something like this .",
    "we explain this in detail below . here",
    "we will only point out that the procedure of taking the limit @xmath108 is quite non - trivial . before passing to the limit",
    "we need to multiply the wave functions of the quantum hamiltonian of the theory by @xmath109 ( this corresponds to adding the term @xmath110 to the action ) .",
    "standard semi - classical analysis shows that after this multiplication the wave functions with eigenvalues that remain finite in the limit @xmath30 tend to the delta - forms which give us a monomial basis in the spaces @xmath111 for different @xmath112 s .",
    "in particular , the exact supersymmetric vacua ( in other words , the bps states ) , which are known to be in bijection with the critical points of @xmath11 @xcite , become in the limit @xmath30 the delta - forms @xmath97 on @xmath88 defined by formula .",
    "next , we consider the hamiltonian .",
    "naively we expect that it is equal to @xmath113 acting on the above space @xmath107 .",
    "however , we claim that it is actually equal to @xmath114 where the summation is over all @xmath115 such that @xmath94 is a codimension @xmath116 stratum in the closure of @xmath88 . here",
    "@xmath117 is the _ grothendieck - cousin operator _ ( gc ) and",
    "@xmath118 is its complex conjugate ( the @xmath119 are some non - zero real numbers ) .",
    "the gc operator acting from @xmath99 to @xmath120 corresponds to taking the singular part of a holomorphic differential form on @xmath88 along this divisor ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we find that the hamiltonian is not diagonalizable ; rather , it has jordan blocks !    in order to test these predictions , we investigate the factorization of correlation functions over intermediate states .",
    "suppose for simplicity that @xmath121 and @xmath11 is the standard `` height '' function ( see section  [ case of pone ] ) . in this case",
    "there is one non - trivial component of the moduli space of gradient trajectories , which consists of the trajectories going from the north pole to the south pole .",
    "it is isomorphic to @xmath122 , hence its natural compactification is @xmath123 .",
    "typical observables of our theory are smooth differential forms . we know from the path integral description of the model that the correlation function of observables @xmath124 corresponding to differential forms @xmath125 is equal to @xmath126 where @xmath85 is the standard @xmath5-action on @xmath123 and @xmath127 denotes the pull - back of a differential form under the action of @xmath128 . consider the simplest case when @xmath129 is a smooth two - form @xmath130 and @xmath131 is a smooth function @xmath132 on @xmath123 , which we will assume to be non - constant",
    ". then we have @xmath133 where @xmath134 .    on the other hand",
    ", we expect this two - point function to factorize into the sum of one - point functions over all possible intermediate states : @xmath135 if the hamiltonian were diagonalizable , the right hand side would be the sum of monomials @xmath136 , where @xmath137 and @xmath112 runs over the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( in our case it consists of non - negative integers ) .",
    "however , consider the following simple example : let @xmath138 we find that @xmath139 the appearance of the logarithmic function indicates that the operator @xmath140 is not diagonalizable , but has jordan blocks of length two , in agreement with our prediction .",
    "thus , the logarithmic nature of our model is revealed by elementary calculation of an integral over the simplest possible moduli space of instantons .",
    "but it is important to stress that in order to see the logarithm function in a correlation function it is necessary that at least one of the observables involved not be @xmath52-closed . the action of @xmath52 on the above observables @xmath141 corresponds to the action of the de rham differential on the differential forms @xmath142 .",
    "thus , in the above calculation the two - form @xmath143 is necessarily @xmath52-closed , and so it is a bps observable .",
    "but @xmath132 is not @xmath52-closed due to our assumption that @xmath132 is not constant .",
    "therefore @xmath144 is not a bps observable .",
    "if both @xmath132 and @xmath130 were @xmath52-closed , then the one - point functions appearing on the right hand side of formula would be non - zero only when the intermediate states are vacuum states . on such states",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonalizable , so we would not be able to observe the logarithmic terms .",
    "the same argument applies to @xmath145-point correlation functions .",
    "thus , we can discover the structure of the space of states of the theory , and in particular , the existence of the jordan blocks of the hamiltonian , _ only _ if we consider correlation functions of non - bps observables .",
    "it is impossible to see these structures within the topological sector of our model .",
    "this is yet another reason why it is important to go beyond the topological sector .",
    "part i of our article contains a detailed and motivated exposition of our results describing the structure of our quantum mechanical models at the special point @xmath146 ( or , equivalently , @xmath147 ) .",
    "we hope that the models corresponding to finite values of @xmath56 may be studied by @xmath58-perturbation theory around the point @xmath146 .",
    "we will present some sample calculations below which provide some evidence that this is indeed possible .    in part",
    "ii we will apply our approach to two - dimensional @xmath148 supersymmetric sigma models and four - dimensional @xmath149 supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "part iii will be devoted to generalization to non - supersymmetric models .",
    "we now discuss briefly what happens in dimensions two and four , thus giving a preview of the part ii of this article .",
    "let us consider first the supersymmetric ( type a twisted ) two - dimensional sigma model @xcite in the @xmath150 limit ( these limits have been previously discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the first step is to recast these models in the framework of the quantum mechanical models that we have studied above . for a fixed riemann surface @xmath32 the space of bosonic fields in the supersymmetric sigma model with the target manifold",
    "@xmath2 is @xmath151 , the space of maps @xmath34 .",
    "if we choose @xmath32 to be the cylinder @xmath152 , then we may interpret @xmath151 as the space of maps from the interval @xmath17 to the loop space @xmath153 .",
    "thus , we may think of the two - dimensional sigma model on the cylinder with the target @xmath2 as the quantum mechanical model on the loop space @xmath154 . hence it is natural to try to write the lagrangian of the sigma model in such a way that it looks exactly like the lagrangian of the quantum mechanical model on @xmath154 with a morse function @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out that if @xmath2 is a khler manifold , this is `` almost '' possible . however , there are two caveats .",
    "first of all , the corresponding function @xmath11 has non - isolated critical points corresponding to the constant loops in @xmath154 , so it is in fact a bott - morse function .",
    "we can deal with this problem by deforming this function so that it only has isolated critical points , corresponding to the constant loops whose values are critical points of a morse function on @xmath2 .",
    "the second , and more serious , issue is that our function @xmath11 is not single - valued on @xmath154 , but becomes single - valued only after pull - back to the universal cover @xmath155 of @xmath154 . in other words",
    ", it is an example of a morse - novikov function , or , more properly , bott - morse - novikov function . because of that",
    ", the instantons are identified with gradient trajectories of the pull - back of @xmath11 to @xmath155 .",
    "the universal cover @xmath155 may be described as the space of equivalence classes of maps @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is a two - dimensional unit disc , modulo the following equivalence relation : we say that @xmath158 if @xmath159 and @xmath160 is homotopically equivalent to @xmath161 in the space of all maps @xmath162 which coincide with @xmath160 and @xmath161 on the boundary circle @xmath163 .",
    "we have the obvious map @xmath164 , which realizes @xmath155 as a covering of @xmath154 .",
    "the group of deck transformations is naturally identified with @xmath165 .",
    "the corresponding morse function , which goes back to the work of a. floer @xcite is given by the formula @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the khler form .",
    "suppose now that @xmath168 with a coordinate @xmath169 .",
    "in the limits @xmath170 a gradient trajectory tends to the critical points of @xmath11 on @xmath155 , which are the preimages of constant maps in @xmath154 . therefore a gradient trajectory may be interpreted as a map of the cylinder , compactified by two points at @xmath171 , to @xmath2 , or equivalently , a map @xmath172 .",
    "moreover , the condition that it corresponds to a gradient trajectory of @xmath11 simply means that this map is _",

    "we obtain the theory governed by first order action . therefore the corresponding path integral localizes on the moduli space of holomorphic maps @xmath174 .",

    "first , we will generalize our results obtained in part i to the case of multivalued morse functions .",
    "( actually , examples of such functions arise already for finite - dimensional real manifolds with non - trivial fundamental groups . )",
    "we will show how to modify our results in this case .",
    "essentially , this amounts to considering the universal cover of our manifold , which is @xmath155 in the case of two - dimensional sigma model .",
    "one also needs to impose an equivariance condition on the states of the model corresponding to the action of the ( abelianized ) fundamental group @xmath178 on @xmath155 . because of this the corresponding spaces of states acquire an additional parameter which is familiar from the construction of `` @xmath12-vacua '' .    besides those changes ,",
    "the structure of the space of states in the limit @xmath0 is similar to the one that we have observed above in our analysis of quantum mechanical models .",
    "there are spaces of `` in '' and `` out '' states , and each of them is isomorphic to the direct sum of certain spaces of `` delta - forms '' supported on the strata of the decomposition of @xmath155 into the ascending and descending manifolds ( however , this direct sum decomposition is not canonical ) .",

    "however , we find that the hamiltonian is not diagonalizable and computing matrix elements of observables acting on the space of states , we see the appearance of the logarithm function .",
    "thus , we find that the two - dimensional supersymmetric model in our infinite radius limit is a _ logarithmic conformal field theory_.    we stress again that to see this structure it is crucial that we consider the correlation functions of non - bps observables .",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonalizable ( in fact , is identically equal to zero ) on the bps states",
    ". therefore correlation functions of the bps observables which have been extensively studied in the literature ( and which are closely related to the gromov - witten invariants ) do not contain logarithms .",
    "the hamiltonian is also diagonalizable on all purely chiral ( and anti - chiral ) states ; thus , the chiral algebra of the theory is free of logarithms .",
    "logarithmic cfts of this type have been considered , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "we remark that in the case when @xmath2 is the flag manifold of a simple lie group , the above semi - infinite stratification of @xmath155 and the corresponding spaces of holomorphic delta - forms have been considered in @xcite .",

    "however , there is again a new element , compared to the previously discussed theories , and that is the appearance of gauge symmetry .",
    "the quotient @xmath203 has complicated singularities because the gauge group @xmath204 has non - trivial stabilizers in the space @xmath205 . for this reason we should consider the _ gauged morse theory _ on the space @xmath205 of connections itself .",
    "this theory is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 be a manifold equipped with an action of a group @xmath38 and a @xmath38-invariant morse function @xmath11 .",

    "however , because this action has non - trivial stabilizers and the ensuing singularities of the quotient , it is better to work equivariantly with the moduli space of solutions of the equations .    in part",
    "ii we will develop a suitable formalism of equivariant integration on the moduli space of gradient trajectories of the gauged morse theory .",
    "we then apply this formalism to the case when @xmath215 , the space of connections on a three - manifold @xmath201 and @xmath11 is the chern - simons functional ( note that this formalism is also used in gauged sigma models in two dimensions ) . in this case",
    "the corresponding equivariant integrals give us the correlation functions of evaluation observables of the yang - mills theory in our weak coupling limit @xmath177 . in the case of the bps",
    "observables these correlation functions are the _ donaldson invariants _ @xcite .",
    "they comprise the topological ( or bps ) sector of the theory .",
    "we will obtain more general ( off - shell ) correlation functions by considering more general , i.e. , non - bps , evaluation observables .",
    "we will present some sample computations of these off - shell correlation functions which exhibit the same effects as in one- and two - dimensional models considered above . in particular , we will observe the appearance of the logarithm ( and more generally , polylogarithm ) function in the correlation functions .",
    "this indicates that , just like the two - dimensional sigma models , the four - dimensional supersymmetric yang - mills theory in the @xmath0 limit is a logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ susy qm ] we give a pedagogical description of the lagrangian formalism of our quantum mechanical models .",

    "we show that in this limit the path integral localizes on the moduli spaces of gradient trajectories of the morse function ( the instantons of the quantum mechanical models ) .",
    "we introduce the observables of the theory and discuss the analogy between their correlation functions and the gromov - witten theory .    in section  [ hamiltonian formalism ]",
    "we start developing the hamiltonian formalism for our models .",
    "we are interested , in particular , with the structure of the space of states of the model in the limit @xmath108 .",

    "we discuss in detail the examples of the flat space @xmath217 and of the simplest `` curved '' manifold @xmath123 .",
    "we show that the space of states decomposes into the spaces of `` in '' and `` out '' states , each having a simple and geometrically meaningful description in terms of the stratifications of our manifold by the ascending and descending manifolds of our morse function .",
    "furthermore , we show that the spaces of states exhibit holomorphic factorization that is absent for finite values of @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to a great simplification of the correlation functions in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "next , in section  [ structure ] we give a more precise description of the spaces of states .",
    "we show that states are naturally interpreted as",
    "_ distributions _ ( or _ currents _ ) on our manifold @xmath2 .",
    "because some of these distributions require regularization ( reminiscent of the epstein - glaser regularization @xcite in quantum field theory ) , the action of the hamiltonian on them becomes non - diagonalizable .",
    "we explain this in detail in the case of the @xmath123 model . for a general khler manifold",
    "we compute the action of the hamiltonian on the spaces of `` in '' and `` out '' states , as well as the action of the supercharges , in terms of the so - called _ grothendieck - cousin operators _ associated to the stratification of our manifold by the ascending and descending manifolds .",
    "we also compute the cohomology of the supercharges using the grothendieck - cousin ( gc ) complex .    in section  [ action ]",
    "we will realize the observables of the model as linear operators acting on the spaces of states .",
    "we will then be able to obtain the correlation functions as matrix elements of these operators and to test our predictions by comparing these matrix elements with the integrals over the moduli spaces of gradient trajectories which were obtained in the path integral approach of section  [ susy qm ] .",
    "we will see that analytic properties of the observables play an important role in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "we will also see that factorization of the correlation functions over intermediate states leads to some non - trivial identities on analytic differential forms .",
    "in particular , the appearance of logarithm in the correlation functions will be seen as the manifestation of the non - diagonal nature of the hamiltonian and as the ultimate validation of our description of the space of states .    finally , in section  [ generalizations ] we discuss possible generalizations of our results .",
    "we consider the question of how to relate the spaces of states of our models for finite and infinite values of @xmath56 , first in the case when @xmath218 and then for @xmath121 .",

    "typically , observables in quantum mechanics on a manifold @xmath327 are obtained by quantizing functions on @xmath328 , which in our case is @xmath329 .",
    "the simplest are the observables corresponding to the functions on @xmath264 , which are the same as differential forms on @xmath2 .",
    "these are quantized in a straightforward way in the coordinate polarization . in the original quantum mechanical model , for finite @xmath56 , the operator",
    ", corresponding to a differential @xmath145-form @xmath330 on @xmath2 ( which is the same thing as a function on @xmath264 , which is a degree @xmath145 polynomial in the fermionic variables ) , is the operator of multiplication by @xmath331 .",
    "the correlation functions of these observables are easiest to compute in the @xmath30 limit by using the path integral .    to see that , consider the following finite - dimensional model situation : a vector space @xmath332 and functions @xmath333 , defining a codimension @xmath334 submanifold @xmath335 .",
    "then the delta - like differential form supported on this subvariety has the following integral representation : @xmath336 this delta - form may be viewed as the limit , when @xmath30 , of the regularized integral @xmath337    comparing these formulas to and , we see that the path integral @xmath338 looks like the delta - like form supported on the gradient trajectories , solutions of the equations , while @xmath339 may be viewed as its regularized version .",
    "more precisely , the integral @xmath340 should be viewed as the mathai - quillen representative of the euler class of an appropriate vector bundle over the space of gradient trajectories ( see @xcite ) .    in a similar way",
    "one shows that in the limit @xmath30 the correlation functions in our theory will be equal to integrals of differential forms over the moduli spaces of gradient trajectories .",
    "note that the integral over fluctuations around the instanton solutions contributes only the one - loop determinants , which cancel each other out for bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom , up to a sign .",
    "moreover , this sign disappears in the case that we are most interested in : when @xmath2 is a khler manifold and the morse function @xmath11 satisfies the conditions listed in section  [ ground ] below .    in particular",
    ", the kernel of the evolution operator in our theory is just the delta - form supported on the submanifold of those pairs @xmath341 which are connected by the gradient trajectories @xmath342 such that @xmath343 and @xmath344 .",
    "from now on we will focus on the case of the infinite line @xmath345 .",
    "the gradient trajectories @xmath346 necessarily start and end at the critical points of @xmath11 ( recall that we have assumed that they are isolated ) .",
    "the corresponding moduli space is therefore a a union of connected components labeled by pairs of critical points of @xmath11 , @xmath347 and @xmath348 , which play the role of the boundary conditions in the path integral .",
    "let @xmath349 be the moduli space of the gradient trajectories , that is solutions @xmath350 to ( [ grad traj ] ) , which obey : @xmath351 we have evaluation maps @xmath352 @xmath353    the simplest observables of our theory correspond to differential forms on @xmath2 .",
    "they are called the _",
    "evaluation observables_. the correlation function of the evaluation observables @xmath141 corresponding to differential forms @xmath354 , on @xmath2 , in the sector corresponding to the boundary conditions @xmath355 is given by the integral @xmath356    if the forms @xmath357 have definite cohomological degrees , then , according to formula , the above integral is non - vanishing only if the following selection rule is obeyed : @xmath358 where @xmath359 is the index of the critical point @xmath253 .",
    "let us note that the correlation function @xmath360[corrf]@xmath361 is invariant with respect to the time shift @xmath362 .",
    "this invariance is verified by the expression ( [ corrf ] ) due to the fact that the time shifts act on @xmath349 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath363 is the gradient trajectory corresponding to a point @xmath364 , then so is @xmath365 thus , we obtain an action of the transformations @xmath366 , on @xmath349 .",
    "since the integral is not changed by the changes of the integration variables , the simultaneous time shift @xmath367 , which can be absorbed into the change of moduli @xmath368 , does not affect the correlation function .    note that if we wish to distinguish contributions of different types of instantons , running between different critical points , we may also add a finite term @xmath369 to the action .",
    "then the above correlation function will get multiplied by the factor @xmath370 .",
    "a natural way to obtain the term is as follows : introduce an additional parameter @xmath12 , the `` @xmath12 angle '' .",
    "let us set @xmath371 let us add to the second order action , instead of , the term @xmath372 consider the limit when @xmath373 so that @xmath374 remains finite , but @xmath375 . in this limit",
    "we recover the first order lagrangian that we have previously obtained in the @xmath108 limit , but with the term added .",
    "the additional coupling constant @xmath12 is the precursor of the @xmath25-field in two - dimensional sigma models and the @xmath12 angle in four - dimensional yang - mills theory ( this will be discussed in detail in part ii ) .",
    "the interpretation viewing the @xmath30 limit as the limit @xmath0 has a direct generalization to quantum field theories in two and four dimensions , which we consider in part ii .",
    "however , in the context of quantum mechanics , this does not add much extra value .",
    "indeed , since the instanton moduli space has finitely many components ( labeled by pairs of critical points @xmath376 ) , separating the contributions of different components with the weight factor @xmath377 does not make much of a difference ( unlike the two - dimensional and four - dimensional models , where the instanton moduli spaces have infinitely many components ) .",
    "[ top sector ]    let us suppose now that our forms @xmath142 are closed , @xmath378 . since the supersymmetry charge @xmath52 of our model at @xmath324 corresponds to the de rham differential , this means that the corresponding observables @xmath141 are @xmath52-closed .",
    "the correlation functions ( [ corrf ] ) simplify considerably in this case .",
    "this simplification is particularly drastic in the case when @xmath2 is a khler manifold , and so we will focus on this case from now on .",
    "there are two reasons for that .",
    "the first reason is that in the calculations below we would like to use the fact that the integral of an exact differential form over @xmath349 is equal to @xmath196 .",
    "but @xmath349 is not compact , and so this statement is not true in general .",
    "note that @xmath349 is the intersection of the descending manifold @xmath379 of @xmath380 and the ascending manifold @xmath381 of @xmath382 .",
    "recall that @xmath379 consists of the possible values at @xmath383 of the gradient trajectories @xmath384 whose value at @xmath385 is the critical point @xmath380 .",
    "likewise , @xmath381 consists of the possible values at @xmath383 of the gradient trajectories @xmath386 \\to x$ ] whose value at @xmath387 is @xmath382 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath2 is a compact khler manifold and the morse function @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of a vector field corresponding to a @xmath63-action .",
    "let us write this vector field as @xmath388 , where @xmath4 is a holomorphic vector field on @xmath2 .",
    "then the gradient of @xmath11 is the vector field @xmath9 . in this case",
    "the descending and ascending manifolds are isomorphic to @xmath389 .",
    "let us assume in addition that that the manifolds @xmath379 and @xmath381 form transversal stratifications of @xmath2",
    ". then @xmath379 has a natural compactification @xmath390 which is just the closure of @xmath379 inside @xmath2 .",
    "since the descending manifolds form a stratification of @xmath2 , this closure is the union of the descending manifolds @xmath391 , where @xmath392 runs over a subset of the critical points which are `` above '' @xmath380 .",
    "likewise , @xmath381 has a compactification which is the union of @xmath393 with @xmath394 running over the set of critical points that are `` below '' @xmath382 .",
    "but then the moduli space @xmath349 has a natural compactification obtained by `` gluing in '' the moduli spaces @xmath395 , where @xmath394 and @xmath392 are critical points that lie `` below '' @xmath382 and `` above '' @xmath380 , respectively .",
    "hence the moduli space @xmath349 is also a complex manifold and its complement in the compactification has real codimension @xmath396 .",
    "therefore the integral of an exact form over @xmath349 is equal to @xmath196 .",
    "the second reason why an additional simplification occurs for khler manifolds is that in this case all ground states of the quantum hamiltonian at the @xmath30 limit are @xmath52-closed , and hence they deform to true ground states for finite values of @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , the action of the supersymmetry charge @xmath52 on the ground states is given by the morse differential , as shown in @xcite .",
    "since the indices of the critical points are even if @xmath2 is a khler manifold , its action is equal to @xmath196 in this case .",
    "let us now derive some properties of the @xmath52-closed observables corresponding to closed differential forms on a khler manifold @xmath2 .",
    "first of all , they are independent of the individual times @xmath397 . indeed , using the cartan formula @xmath398 for the vector field @xmath399 , we find @xmath400 hence the @xmath169-derivative of the integral is equal to zero .",
    "another important property is that if all @xmath142 s are closed and at least one of them is exact : @xmath401 , then the corresponding correlation function vanishes .",
    "indeed , we then find that @xmath402 this is also clear from the point of view of the original path integral , because the lagrangian of our theory is @xmath52-exact .",
    "this has an important consequence : consider the theory at finite values of @xmath56 .",
    "as we explained above , it can be viewed as a deformation of the theory at @xmath324 obtained by adding to the lagrangian the expression . since",
    "this expression is @xmath52-exact , the corresponding correlation function of @xmath52-closed observables will be independent of this deformation , and so the answer that we obtain in the theory at @xmath324 will remain valid at finite values of @xmath56 ( at least in some neighborhood of @xmath403 ) .    here",
    "it is important to note that the supersymmetry charge @xmath52 of the theory with the action is independent of @xmath56 and corresponds to the de rham differential ( in particular , it is the same for finite @xmath56 as for @xmath146 ) .",
    "but the supersymmetry charge of the `` physical '' theory with the action differs from it by conjugation with @xmath404 .",
    "however , this conjugation does not change the evaluation observables corresponding to the differential forms , and therefore these observables are @xmath52-closed in both theories .",
    "thus , we arrive at the following conclusion : there is a sector of the `` physical '' theory which is independent of @xmath56 .",
    "it comprises the @xmath52-closed observables , corresponding to closed differential forms on @xmath2 .",
    "the correlation functions of these observables ( on the infinite line and with the boundary conditions @xmath405 ) are given , for all values of @xmath56 , by integrals over the finite - dimensional moduli spaces of instantons @xmath406 . ) by the term @xmath407 , the correlation functions of the `` physical '' theory will be equal to the correlation functions of the first order theory at @xmath324 times @xmath408 the correlation functions of the @xmath52-closed observables @xmath141 do not depend on the closed forms @xmath142 themselves , but only on their cohomology classes .",
    "for this reason this sector of the theory is called the `` topological sector '' and the corresponding theory is referred to as `` topological field theory '' .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath52-closed observables are referred to as the `` bps observables '' and the topological sector is called the `` bps sector '' .",
    "it is instructive to note the analogy between the topological sector of the morse quantum mechanical model considered above and the gromov - witten theory .",
    "this analogy will become more clear in part ii of this article when we discuss the two - dimensional sigma models .",
    "this material is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a compact khler manifold and @xmath32 a compact riemann surface .",
    "the analogues of the moduli spaces @xmath409 in gromov - witten theory are the moduli spaces @xmath410 of holomorphic maps @xmath411 of a fixed degree @xmath412 . for a point @xmath413",
    "we have evaluation maps @xmath414 .",
    "now , given an @xmath145-tuple of points @xmath415 and a collection of differential forms @xmath125 on @xmath2 , we can consider the integral @xmath416 we will assume for simplicity that @xmath417 does not admit any continuous automorphisms .",
    "this integral is not compact , but for compact @xmath2 this integral is well - defined for smooth differential forms @xmath142 on @xmath2 under the above assumption on @xmath417 ] is analogous to the integrals .",
    "they are equal to correlation functions of evaluation observables of the two - dimensional supersymmetric sigma model with the target @xmath2 in the infinite radius limit ( we will consider this model in more detail in part ii ) .",
    "let @xmath419 be the moduli space of data @xmath420 , where @xmath32 is a genus @xmath8 riemann surface .",
    "then we have a projection @xmath421 , and @xmath410 is the fiber of @xmath422 at @xmath423 .",
    "we have natural evaluation maps @xmath424 .",
    "the general gromov - witten invariants are the integrals @xmath425 these are the correlation functions of what is often referred to as the `` sigma model coupled to gravity '' , and the observables are the `` cohomological descendents '' of the evaluation observables .    instead of integrating over @xmath419",
    ", we may take the push - forward @xmath426 which is a differential form on @xmath427 .",
    "in particular , occurs as a special case when the degree of this differential form is equal to zero",
    ". then its value at @xmath428 is given by .",
    "more general observables give rise to differential forms of positive degree on @xmath427 .",
    "more precisely , we need to replace @xmath419 by the kontsevich s space of stable maps @xmath429 and @xmath427 by its deligne - mumford compactification @xmath430 .    in the quantum mechanical model the analogues of the moduli spaces of holomorphic maps are the moduli spaces @xmath431 of gradient trajectories , and the analogues of the moduli spaces of stable maps are compactifications of @xmath431 discussed above .",
    "the integrals that we have considered so far are the analogues of the integrals .",
    "the definition of the analogues of the more general integrals is also straightforward .",
    "let @xmath432 be the moduli space of data @xmath433 , where @xmath415 are distinct points of the real line , considered as an affine line , i.e. , without a fixed coordinate , and @xmath434 is a gradient trajectory .",
    "if we choose a coordinate @xmath169 on @xmath202 , then we can replace @xmath435 by the real numbers @xmath436 and @xmath253 by a parameterized map @xmath350 .",
    "other coordinates are obtained by a shift @xmath437 .",
    "therefore we may equivalently consider the data @xmath438 modulo the diagonal action of the group @xmath202 of translations : @xmath439    note that the group of translations plays here the same role that the group @xmath440 of mbius transformation of @xmath441 plays in the gromov - witten theory .",
    "we have a natural map @xmath442 , where @xmath443 is the configuration space of @xmath145 points on the real line ( here @xmath444 is the union of all diagonals ) .",
    "it plays the role of @xmath445 .",
    "there is also a natural relative compactification @xmath446 of @xmath432 defined similarly to the moduli spaces of stable maps ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have the evaluation maps @xmath447 corresponding to evaluating the map @xmath434 at the point @xmath448 .",
    "now it is clear that the analogues of the general gromov - witten invariants in morse theory are obtained as the push - forwards @xmath449 these `` morse theory invariants '' are nothing but differential forms on the configuration space @xmath450 .",
    "the simplest examples are the zero - form components of these differential forms whose values at fixed points @xmath415 are just the integrals introduced above . these more general correlation functions may be interpreted as the correlation functions of the @xmath141 s and their `` cohomological descendents '' , which are constructed following @xcite .",
    "note that the observable @xmath141 is a @xmath196-form on the `` worldline '' @xmath202 , i.e. , a function .",
    "the cohomological descendant of @xmath141 is the @xmath116-form @xmath451 on @xmath202 defined by the formula @xmath452 where @xmath453 is the gradient vector field @xmath454 . in particular , suppose that @xmath142 is a closed differential form on @xmath2 . since @xmath141 is obtained from @xmath142 by pulling back with respect to a gradient trajectory , we have @xmath455 , where @xmath456 is the lie derivative with respect to the gradient vector field @xmath453 . since the action of @xmath52 corresponds to the action of the de rham differential @xmath457 along @xmath2 , we obtain , using the cartan formula @xmath458 , that @xmath459 where @xmath460 is the de rham differential along the worldline .",
    "this is analogous to the formula for the cohomological descent in the gromov - witten theory @xcite .",
    "the general `` morse theory invariants '' may be interpreted as correlation functions of observables of this type alongside the @xmath141 s considered before .",
    "more precisely , when we take the pull - back of a differential @xmath461-form @xmath142 on @xmath2 via @xmath447 , we obtain an @xmath461-form on @xmath462 , which decomposes locally into the sum of two differential forms .",
    "one is a @xmath461-form along the fiber of the projection @xmath463 and @xmath196-form along the base : it corresponds to @xmath141 , and the other is a @xmath464-form along the fiber and a @xmath116-form along the base : this is @xmath451 .",
    "thus , the correlation function of @xmath465 `` zero - observables '' @xmath141 and @xmath466 `` one - observables '' @xmath467 will pick up precisely the @xmath466-form component of the general `` morse theory invariant '' on @xmath468 defined by formula .    from the physical perspective , defining these more general correlation functions corresponds to `` coupling our quantum mechanical model to gravity '' . in the path integral",
    "formalism it is described as follows .",
    "we write our action in the form @xmath469 where @xmath140 is the classical hamiltonian whose quantization gives @xmath470 , and @xmath471 is its superpartner whose quantization gives @xmath472 . in order to enforce the invariance under the time reparameterizations and at the same time",
    "preserve the @xmath52-symmetry we add the einbein field @xmath473 and its superpartner @xmath474 and consider the action @xmath475 the path integrals corresponding to this action may be expressed in terms of the `` morse theory invariants '' .",
    "note also that more generally we may consider arbitrary graphs instead of the real line .",
    "we then need to assign to each edge of the graph a morse function and impose the condition that the sum of the functions corresponding to the edges coming out of each vertex is zero .",
    "the corresponding integrals are related to the integrals considered by fukaya @xcite .",
    "they may also be interpreted as the terms of the perturbative expansion of a particular quantum field theory on @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , if we only allow three - valent graphs , this will be the perturbative expansion of the ( generalized ) chern - simons theory on @xmath2 around a particular background , and can be viewed as a topological open string on @xmath476 , as in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , if we allow @xmath334 different morse functions @xmath477 , then this will be the chern - simons theory with the lagrangian @xmath478 where @xmath7 is an @xmath479-valued differential form on @xmath2 , and we make the perturbation theory expansion around the one - form @xmath480 .",
    "this is however beyond the scope of the present paper .    for more on the topological supersymmetric quantum mechanics ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "[ other observables ]    as we discussed above , the observables in the bps sector correspond to closed differential forms on @xmath2",
    ". however , _ any _ differential form @xmath130 on @xmath2 gives rise to a legitimate observable in our theory , and the correlation functions of such observables are still given by the same integrals over the moduli spaces @xmath431 ( or @xmath432 ) as in the case of closed forms .",
    "the difference is , of course , that these correlation functions are no longer independent of @xmath56 , so this answer is correct only at @xmath146 .",
    "why should we bother considering non - bps evaluation observables ?",
    "we have already partially answered this question in the introduction .",
    "in particular , if we only consider the bps observables , we can not gain any insights into the structure of the space of states of our theory beyond the ground states .",
    "indeed , their correlation functions only depend on their @xmath52-cohomology classes .",
    "one can modify any bps observable by @xmath52-exact terms so as to make it commute with @xmath52 and @xmath320 .",
    "such a representative transforms a ground state into a ground state .",
    "but non - bps observables transform ground states into excited states , and , as we will see below , we can understand the structure of the space of states by considering their correlation functions .    besides , considering non - bps observables allows us to bring into play some important @xmath52-exact observables , which are `` invisible '' in the bps sector .",
    "a general local observable of the quantum mechanical model that we are considering corresponds to the quantization of an arbitrary function @xmath481 . upon quantization",
    "they become _ differential operators _ on @xmath482 : @xmath483 examples are the differential forms themselves , which we have already considered above , and the lie derivatives @xmath78 with respect to vector fields on @xmath2 .",
    "if we write @xmath484 , then @xmath485 these observables have a transparent path integral interpretation .",
    "namely , inserting this observable at the time @xmath486 corresponds to infinitesimally deforming the gradient trajectory at the time @xmath486 along the vector field @xmath453 . in particular , our hamiltonian is included among these observables .",
    "the observables @xmath78 are @xmath52-closed , but they are also @xmath52-exact , as follows from the cartan formula @xmath487 that we have already encountered above .",
    "this means that if we insert the operator @xmath78 into a correlation function of bps observables , then we will obtain zero .",
    "but the observables @xmath78 , and other differential operators , play a very important role in the full theory .",
    "indeed , on a khler manifold we often have a large lie algebra of global holomorphic vector fields , and the corresponding lie derivatives will be chiral operators of our theory .",
    "the algebra of holomorphic differential operators that they generate is the precursor of the chiral de rham complex of @xcite . if we wish to understand the role played by the chiral de rham complex in the two - dimensional sigma models , it is natural to consider its quantum mechanical analogue : the algebra of holomorphic differential operators on @xmath2 ( more precisely , its supersymmetric analogue : the algebra of holomorphic differential operators on @xmath226 ) .",
    "but in order to obtain non - trivial correlation functions involving these operators we must consider non - bps observables .",
    "as we already indicated above , at @xmath146 the correlation functions of non - bps evaluation observables are easy to obtain from the path integral point of view .",
    "our goal now is to give an interpretation of these correlation functions from the hamiltonian point of view . in other words ,",
    "we wish to describe explicitly the space of states of the theory at @xmath146 , represent the general observables as operators acting on this space and represent their correlation functions as matrix elements of these operators .",
    "we will take up this task in the next section .",
    "in the previous section we discussed the lagrangian ( or path integral ) formulation of the supersymmetric quantum mechanical model on a khler manifold @xmath2 governed by the first order action in the limit @xmath146 . this formulation is convenient because it gives a simple answer for the correlation functions of the observables corresponding to differential forms on @xmath2 : they are given by integrals over finite - dimensional moduli spaces of gradient trajectories .",
    "now we would like to develop the hamiltonian formalism for this model .",
    "this means that we need to define the space of states of the model and realize our observables as linear operators acting on this space of states .",
    "the correlation functions are then given by matrix elements of these operators .",
    "note that the lagrangian description provides us with an important testing device : these matrix elements should reproduce the finite - dimensional integrals described above .",
    "we will see in this section that the hamiltonian structure of our model is rather unusual : the quantum hamiltonian is non - hermitean and even non - diagonalizable , and the space of states decomposes into the spaces of `` in '' and `` out '' states .",
    "however , these spaces have a simple and geometrically meaningful description in terms of the stratifications by the ascending and descending manifolds of our morse function . moreover , the spaces of states exhibit holomorphic factorization that is absent for finite values of @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to a great simplification of the correlation functions . in section  [ action ] we will establish the equivalence between the results obtained in the hamiltonian and the lagrangian formalisms , discovering along the way some interesting identities on integrals of analytic differential forms .",
    "our task is to describe the hamiltonian formalism of the theory with the first order action . following the most obvious route , we start with the classical hamiltonian found from this action : @xmath488 its naive quantization is the operator @xmath489 which is the lie derivative with respect to the gradient vector field @xmath399 .",
    "the corresponding supersymmetry charges are @xmath490 and @xmath491 .",
    "they satisfy the relation @xmath492 according to cartan s formula .    the standard hodge theory , which is at work in the quantum mechanical model at finite values of @xmath56 ( see section  [ recollections morse ] ) , deals with the operators like @xmath233 and @xmath232 , which depend explicitly on the metric on the manifold @xmath2 .",
    "here we choose instead the operators @xmath233 and @xmath493 , for some vector field @xmath453 , which are metric independent .",
    "the problem with this definition is that the hamiltonian @xmath494 is a first order differential operator , which naively has an unbounded spectrum .",
    "also , if we take the time evolution operator @xmath495 for large @xmath169 , it will tend to make the wave functions concentrated near the critical points of the morse function ( where @xmath496 ) , thus posing some problems with completeness .",
    "besides , the choice of zero eigenstates of @xmath497 seems quite ambiguous , for any differential form ( or current ) supported on a @xmath453-invariant submanifold in @xmath2 naively leads to such a state .    finally , in the standard supersymmetric quantum mechanics the operators @xmath263 and @xmath498 are adjoint to each other , and as the result , the hamiltonian is self - adjoint .",
    "but this property no longer holds in our case , and so we can not expect that @xmath494 is self - adjoint .",
    "[ way out ]    in order to make sense of all this , we recall how we got the action in the first place : we started with the second order action for finite values of @xmath56 , then we added the topological term @xmath499 passed to the first order action , and finally took the limit @xmath30 .",
    "this suggests that in order to develop the correct hamiltonian formalism of the theory we should retrace these steps from the hamiltonian point of view .",
    "we recall from section  [ recollections morse ] that the hamiltonian of the theory with the action is given by formula @xmath500 where @xmath501 this hamiltonian is witten s laplacian given by formula .",
    "the corresponding space of states is just the space of @xmath75 differential forms on @xmath2 .",
    "this is a hilbert ( super)space with respect to the hermitean inner product",
    ".    here is is important to note that because we rescale by @xmath56 both the morse function and the _ metric _ on @xmath2 ( which leads to the overall factor @xmath58 in the formula for @xmath502 ) , we obtain witten s laplacian multiplied by @xmath58 .",
    "this difference in normalization is important : in the normalization of @xcite the smallest non - zero eigenvalue of the hamiltonian is of the order of @xmath56 , and hence only the ground states survive in the limit @xmath30 ( recall that we are under the assumption that @xmath2 is khler , and so all ground states at @xmath146 deform to true ground states at finite @xmath56 ) . in our normalization not only the ground states , but also the states with the eigenvalues proportional to @xmath56 ( in the normalization of @xcite ) , survive in this limit",
    ". these will be the excited states of our theory at @xmath146 , as we will see below .",
    "the next step is to add the term to the action .",
    "what does this correspond to from the hamiltonian point of view ? to see that , we recall the correspondence between the correlation functions in the lagrangian and hamiltonian formalisms expressed in formula . when we add the topological term to the action",
    ", the right hand side of this formula is multiplied by @xmath503 .",
    "this means that the correlation function in the new theory ( with the term ) between the `` in '' state @xmath504 and the `` out '' state @xmath505 is the same as the correlation function of the old theory ( without the term ) between the states @xmath506 and @xmath507 .",
    "thus , we obtain that from the hamiltonian point of view the effect of the addition of the term to the action is the following :    * the `` in '' states get multiplied by @xmath508 : @xmath509 * the `` out '' states get multiplied by @xmath510 : @xmath511 * the operators get conjugated : @xmath512    the last rule applies , in particular , to the operators @xmath263 , @xmath502 and @xmath140 .",
    "we find that the new operators are and @xmath502 in formulas , : there we defined @xmath263 by conjugating @xmath233 by @xmath513 , and then defined @xmath502 as the _ adjoint _ of @xmath263 , so that @xmath502 was obtained by conjugating @xmath232 by @xmath109 ( and dividing by @xmath56 ) .",
    "in particular , their anti - commutator @xmath514 has a very different spectrum from @xmath515 .",
    "now we are conjugating both @xmath263 and @xmath502 by @xmath109 .",
    "the resulting operators are @xmath516 and @xmath517 .",
    "they are not adjoint to each other any more .",
    "but the corresponding anti - commutator @xmath518 has the same spectrum as @xmath519 for any finite value of @xmath56 . ]",
    "@xmath520    finally , we may take the limit @xmath30 and we indeed recover the operators @xmath521 and @xmath522 that we discussed above .",
    "however , now we obtain a more clear picture of what is happening with the space of states as we perform the above procedure .",
    "namely , to obtain the `` in '' space of states we need to choose a suitably normalized basis of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath140 , then multiply all of them by @xmath109 and pass to the limit @xmath108 . likewise , to obtain the `` out '' space of states we need to multiply those basis eigenfunctions by @xmath523 and then pass to the limit .",
    "the main question is of course what",
    "we mean by `` taking the limit '' , in particular , in what ambient space the limiting elements `` live '' .",
    "as we will argue in section  [ structure ] , the proper ambient space is not the space of functions on @xmath2 ( or , more generally , differential forms ) , but the space of _ generalized functions _",
    ", i.e. , a suitable space of linear functionals on the space of functions ( or , more generally , _",
    "currents _ , i.e. , functionals on the space of differential forms ) .",
    "we will first explain how this works in the flat space , namely , for @xmath218 , and then discuss in detail the first example of a `` curved '' space , namely , @xmath121 .    before proceeding with these examples ,",
    "we wish to comment on the reason why the spaces of `` in '' and `` out '' states turn out to be different in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "this is easiest to explain from the lagrangian point of view .",
    "the `` in '' and `` out '' states in a general quantum mechanical model may be constructed by acting by local observables on the vacuum and covacuum states , respectively .",
    "namely , let @xmath524 , be observables with @xmath525 and @xmath526 the corresponding state , considered as a differential form on @xmath2 .",
    "then we have the following symbolic representation of this state using the path integral : @xmath527 \\to x ; \\ , x(0 ) = x } \\int { \\mc o}_1(t_1 ) \\ldots { \\mc o}_n(t_n ) e^{-s}.\\ ] ] the boundary conditions at @xmath387 in the above integral are determined by the choice of the ground state @xmath528 .",
    "likewise , an `` out '' state of our model is constructed by the formula @xmath529 where the boundary conditions at @xmath385 are determined by the choice of the covacuum state @xmath530 .",
    "this construction allows us to define a natural pairing between the two spaces : if we denote the state by @xmath185 and the state by @xmath531 , then by definition @xmath532 with appropriate boundary conditions understood .",
    "in general , the spaces of `` in '' and `` out '' states are different . however , suppose that the action of our theory is cpt invariant , that is invariant under the time reversal @xmath533 and complex conjugation ( this corresponds to the hamiltonian being a self - adjoint operator ) .",
    "in this case we have a natural anti - linear map from the space of `` in '' states to the space of `` out '' states : namely , by applying the time reversal and complex conjugation we transform the integral into an integral of the form , hence we transform an `` in '' state into an `` out '' state .",
    "this allows us to identify the two spaces in the case when the action is invariant under the cpt symmetry . combining this identification and the pairing , we obtain a hermitean inner product on the resulting ( single ) space of states .    however , our action is not invariant under the above cpt symmetry .",
    "the original action is cpt - invariant , but the topological term that we have added to it breaks this invariance . were purely imaginary , but we need @xmath56 to be real ! ] therefore there is no natural identification between the spaces of `` in '' and `` out '' states . for finite values of @xmath56 ,",
    "the cpt invariance is only mildly violated : when we apply the cpt transformation , we shift the action by @xmath534 .",
    "this means that there is still a map from the space of `` in '' states to the space of `` out '' states , but it involves multiplication by @xmath535 .",
    "more precisely , this map sends @xmath536 however , the operation of multiplication by @xmath537 has no obvious limit @xmath30 , and so at @xmath324 the two spaces become _ non - isomorphic_. this is reflected in the fact that the action is not cpt - invariant and the hamiltonian @xmath522 is not self - adjoint .",
    "thus , we arrive at the following conclusion :    _ in the limit @xmath538 our model has two spaces of states : the space of `` in '' states @xmath539 , and the space of `` out '' states @xmath540 .",
    "the transition amplitudes define a pairing : @xmath541 but the two spaces are not canonically isomorphic . _",

    "here we need to consider the path integral on the half - line from @xmath196 to @xmath693 , so the ground states are supported on the submanifold of those @xmath694 which could be connected to the critical point @xmath92 by a gradient trajectory @xmath695 such that @xmath696 and @xmath697 .",
    "this is precisely the descending manifold @xmath662 . from the hamiltonian point of view",
    "this is also clear , because the `` out '' state corresponding to is @xmath698 which tends to the delta form @xmath671 supported on @xmath662 .    to summarize",
    ", we have now determined the ground states of our quantum mechanical model at @xmath324 , for any khler manifold equipped with a morse function satisfying the conditions listed above :    _ the `` in '' ground states are the delta - forms @xmath97 supported on the closures of the ascending manifolds @xmath88 of the morse function , and the `` out '' ground states are the delta - forms @xmath671 supported on the closures of the descending manifolds @xmath662 . _    [ back to pone ]    what about the excited states of the theory ? for finite values of @xmath56 explicit formulas for those are unknown , but for large @xmath56 we can understand the behavior of `` low - lying '' eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath552 qualitatively using the standard semi - classical methods . here `` low - lying '' means that the eigenvalue remains a finite number as @xmath30 . in general",
    ", there will be other eigenfunctions as well ( for example , of order @xmath56 ) , but since we are interested in the limit @xmath30 , we will ignore them .",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath121 first .",
    "semi - classical approximation tells us that as far as the low - lying excited states are concerned , the situation is as follows : the eigenfunctions are localized in the neighborhoods of the critical points , and the picture around each critical point is qualitatively the same as in the case of the flat space @xmath218 discussed in the previous section .",
    "thus , we have two sets of eigenfunctions , corresponding to the points @xmath196 and @xmath647 , which will be indicated by a subscript . in both cases we also have to take into account the degree of the state considered as a differential form .",
    "consider first the states corresponding to the critical point @xmath585 ( we will mark them with a left subscript @xmath196 ) .",
    "this is a `` repulsive '' critical point as can be seen from the expansion of @xmath11 near @xmath585 .",
    "therefore the structure of the low - lying eigenfunctions localized near @xmath585 will be the same as that of the eigenfunctions obtained in the case of @xmath218 and a `` repulsive '' critical point .",
    "let us start with the @xmath196-forms .",
    "recalling the formulas obtained in section  [ flat space ] , we find that those are labeled by two integers @xmath699 , and near zero are approximately equal to @xmath700 the first of them , @xmath701 is in fact the ground state @xmath702 given by formula .",
    "however , we have now changed our normalization , so as to make the limits of these functions , multiplied by @xmath109 , well - defined .",
    "we also have excited states that are @xmath116-forms and @xmath396-forms : @xmath703    after we multiply these eigenfunctions by @xmath109 , they become polynomial differential forms on @xmath683 , which is the ascending manifold corresponding to the critical point @xmath585 .",
    "thus , we conclude that in the @xmath30 limit the space of `` in '' states contains a piece @xmath704 \\otimes \\lambda[dz , d{\\zb}],\\ ] ] as in the case of @xmath218 and a `` repulsive '' critical point .",
    "next , we look at the excited states corresponding to the critical point @xmath644 , or @xmath705 , where @xmath646 ( we will mark them with a left subscript @xmath647 ) .",
    "this critical point is `` attractive '' , according to formula .",
    "following the example of @xmath218 with an `` attractive '' critical point , and recalling the expansion of @xmath11 near @xmath647 , we find that there will be other eigenfunctions , which near @xmath655 are equal to @xmath706 the first of them is the ground state .",
    "we have again changed our normalization so as to obtain a well - defined limit as @xmath30 .",
    "multiplying these forms by @xmath109 and taking the limit @xmath108 , we obtain the derivatives of the delta - form @xmath707 in addition , there will be one - forms and zero - forms @xmath708 obtained by contracting the above two - forms with the vector fields @xmath709 and @xmath710 .",
    "thus , we obtain that this critical point contributes the piece @xmath711 { \\dl}^{(2 ) } ( w , { \\wb } ) \\otimes { \\lambda } [ dw , d{\\wb } ] \\ ] ] to the space of `` in '' states of the theory at @xmath146 .",

    "[ hol fact ]    the discussion of the previous section is generalized in a straightforward way to the case of an arbitrary khler manifold satisfying the above conditions . recall that we have the stratifications of @xmath2 by descending and ascending manifolds . for each ascending manifold @xmath88",

    "we will realize the evaluation observables of our model as linear operators acting on the spaces of states .",
    "we will then be able to obtain the correlation functions as matrix elements of these operators and to test our predictions by comparing these matrix elements with the integrals over the moduli of the gradient trajectories which were obtained in the path integral approach , as explained in section  [ cor fns as int ] .",
    "the answer we have given for the space of states @xmath648 in formula requires some explanations .",
    "consider for example the case of @xmath121 .",
    "we have claimed that @xmath808 where @xmath809 is the space of differential forms on the one - dimensional cell @xmath775 and @xmath810 is the space of delta - forms supported at @xmath647 .",
    "these delta - forms are naturally functionals , i.e. , distributions ( more precisely , currents ) on the space of differential forms on @xmath123 . for example , the ground state @xmath656 is the functional whose value on a function @xmath11 on @xmath123 is equal to @xmath811 , and it is equal to zero on all differential forms of positive degree .",
    "thus , the subspace @xmath809 appears to be realized in the space of differential forms , while the subspace @xmath810 is realized in the space of distributions or currents , that is functionals on the space of differential forms .",
    "this is puzzling because the two spaces appear to be of different nature .",
    "the second puzzle is that elements of @xmath809 are well - defined only on the subset @xmath812 and , with the exception of the constant functions , have poles at @xmath647 .",
    "therefore the integrals of the products of such elements with an observable of our theory , which is _ a priori _ an arbitrary smooth differential form on @xmath2 , is not well - defined . but",
    "integrals of this type naturally appear as the one - point correlation functions of our theory at finite values of @xmath56 .",
    "for example , let @xmath813 be the observable of our theory which corresponds to a smooth two - form @xmath130 on @xmath123 , and consider the one - point function represented by the matrix element @xmath814 where @xmath815 and @xmath816 is the eigenvalue of @xmath140 on @xmath817 .",
    "we have argued that in the limit @xmath108 the `` out '' state corresponding to @xmath818 becomes equal to @xmath116 , while the `` in '' state corresponding to @xmath817 becomes equal to @xmath819 .",
    "therefore to make sense of the theory at @xmath146 we should be able to compute integrals of the form @xmath820 for a general smooth two - form @xmath130 on @xmath123 .",
    "unfortunately , these integrals generally diverge for @xmath821 . but this discussion leads us to an important idea : it suggests that a proper definition of the state corresponding to @xmath817 in the limit @xmath30 assumes that we can evaluate the integrals of the form .",
    "therefore it is only natural to view these states not as functions on @xmath123 , but as distributions ! this",
    "at least allows us to treat @xmath809 and @xmath810 on equal footing .",
    "it now becomes clear that our space of states @xmath805 with its decomposition should be considered as a subspace of the space of distributions ( or currents ) on the space of smooth differential forms on @xmath123 .",
    "viewing states as distributions is most natural from the point of view of the path integral .",
    "recall formula describing states as path integrals . now , given a differential form @xmath130 on @xmath2 , set @xmath822 \\to x ; \\ , x(0 ) = x } \\int { \\mc o}_1(t_1 ) \\ldots { \\mc o}_n(t_n ) e^{-s}.\\ ] ] thus , the state @xmath823 is naturally interpreted as a linear functional on differential forms , i.e. , a distribution .    the delta - forms supported at @xmath647 are legitimate distributions .",
    "but what kind of distribution can we associate to the function @xmath824 which has a pole at @xmath668 ?",
    "this question has a well - known answer in the theory of generalized functions , as we now explain following @xcite , sect .",
    "3.2 and @xcite , sect . b1 .",
    "first of all , let us recall that by definition a _ distribution _ on @xmath123 is a continuous linear functional on the space of smooth functions on @xmath123 , equipped with the topology induced by the norm @xmath825 .",

    "we denote the space of such distributions by @xmath826 .",
    "next , we define the space @xmath827 of _ schwartz functions _ on @xmath828 : its elements are smooth functions @xmath11 on @xmath683 such that @xmath829 is bounded on @xmath830 ( and hence well - defined at @xmath647 ) for all @xmath831 .",
    "such a function therefore extends to a smooth function on @xmath123 ; moreover , it necessarily decays as @xmath832 .",
    "define a topology on the space @xmath827 induced by the family of semi - norms @xmath833 a _ tempered distribution _ on @xmath683 is by definition a continuous linear functional on @xmath827 .",
    "we define in the same way the space @xmath834 of schwartz differential forms on @xmath683 .",
    "we will call continuous linear functionals on @xmath834 `` tempered distributions on differential forms on @xmath683 '' .",
    "now observe that for all @xmath835 the monomial @xmath819 defines a continuous linear functional @xmath836 , hence a tempered distribution on differential forms on @xmath683 by the formula @xmath837 the integral converges because of the condition imposed on elements of @xmath834 ( note that it is non - zero only if @xmath130 is a two - form ) .",
    "thus , we are now in the following situation : we have the subspace @xmath838 and a continuous linear functional @xmath836 on @xmath834 defined by formula .",
    "can we extend this functional to the larger space @xmath839 ?",
    "it turns out that we can , but there are many possible extensions and there is no canonical choice among them , unless @xmath840 or @xmath841 . the good news , however , is that any two possible extensions differ by a distribution supported at @xmath647 .",
    "therefore , even though the span of all functionals @xmath842 , is not canonically defined as a subspace of @xmath826 , the span of these functionals together with the functionals @xmath843 is well - defined .",
    "we have an analogous statement for the @xmath193-form versions of these spaces , where @xmath844 .",
    "thus , we obtain that the sum @xmath845 is a well - defined subspace of the space of all distributions on @xmath123 .",
    "we now _ define _ the space @xmath648 of  in  states of the @xmath123 model in the @xmath146 limit as this subspace of @xmath826 . this way we resolve the first puzzle pointed out at the beginning of this section ( the fact that @xmath809 and @xmath846 seem to be objects of different nature ) .",
    "but we have not yet explained how to extend the linear functionals @xmath836 to @xmath826 and make sense of the integrals for arbitrary smooth differential forms @xmath847 .",
    "we will explain that in the next section .",
    "a particular extension of the tempered distribution @xmath836 to a distribution on @xmath123 is constructed by introducing a `` cutoff '' : for @xmath848 , consider the integral @xmath849 which is well - defined for any positive real @xmath850 .",
    "one can show that as a function in @xmath850 it may be uniquely represented in the form @xmath851 where the @xmath852 s and @xmath853 are some numbers ( see @xcite , pp",
    ". 70 - 71 )",
    ". therefore one defines , following hadamard , the _ partie finie _ of the above integral as the constant coefficient @xmath830 obtained after discarding the terms with negative powers of @xmath850 and @xmath854 in the integral and taking the limit @xmath855 .",
    "we denote it by @xmath856 a similar regularization has also been used in quantum field theory , in particular , in the works of epstein and glaser @xcite .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath857 , then @xmath858 so we indeed obtain an extension of @xmath836 to a distribution on @xmath123 .",
    "we will denote it by @xmath859 .",
    "note that the distribution we obtain takes non - zero values only on two - forms on @xmath123 .",
    "the problem with this definition is that it is not canonical .",
    "indeed , we do not have a canonical coordinate on @xmath123 , because we are only given points @xmath196 and @xmath647 , so our coordinate @xmath776 is only defined up to multiplication by a non - zero scalar .",
    "if we rescale our coordinate @xmath860 , then the functional @xmath859 will change as we will now integrate over the region @xmath861 , and the integral will be different due to the presence of the logarithmic term in . however , the resulting change will amount to a distribution supported at @xmath668 , so that the span of these distributions and the distributions supported at @xmath647 is a canonically defined subspace of @xmath826 .",
    "let us compute the values of the distributions @xmath859 in some examples .",
    "let @xmath862 where the numbers @xmath863 satisfy the condition @xmath864 which ensures that @xmath130 is well - defined at @xmath647 .",
    "writing @xmath865 , we find that @xmath866_{\\ep^0 } \\\\",

    "these distributions take non - zero values on differential forms of degree @xmath869 .",
    "again , they are not canonically defined , but their span together with the span of @xmath870-forms in @xmath846 will be well - defined . this span is the @xmath870-form part of our space of `` in '' states @xmath805 .      having defined the space @xmath648 as a particular subspace of the space of distributions on @xmath123 , we can now find explicitly the action of the hamiltonian @xmath871 , where @xmath872 .",
    "actually , we will compute separately the action of @xmath240 and @xmath873 , where @xmath874 .",
    "we will see that due to the non - canonical nature of the decomposition these operators act non - diagonally , with jordan blocks .",
    "consider first the action of @xmath240 and @xmath875 on the subspace @xmath876 ( which is a canonical subspace of @xmath648 ) .",
    "this subspace has the following basis : @xmath877 by definition , @xmath878 we find that latexmath:[\\ ] ] we conjecture that @xmath1475}_{\\infty } = ( e^{[0 ] } ) ^{k+1 } o\\left ( 1 \\right).\\ ] ] this would imply that the radius of convergence of the corresponding perturbative expansion is approximately @xmath1476})^{-1}$ ] , which means that we understand well the eigenfunctions whose eigenvalues are less than @xmath56 .",
    "this agrees with the qualitative picture suggested by the semi - classical analysis .",
    "the determination of the perturbation series for the `` in '' states that belong to the subspace @xmath1477 is more complicated because of the jordan block structure of the hamiltonian . indeed , according to the calculations of section  [ action ham ] , almost all of the states @xmath1478 in @xmath1477 are generalized eigenvectors of the hamiltonian : @xmath1479 as we have seen in the previous section ( the exception is the states @xmath1480 and @xmath1481 ) .",
    "we also find the following formula for the action of @xmath1482 : @xmath1483    the corresponding perturbation theory is unusual , because normally one considers hermitean hamiltonians which can not have jordan blocks .",
    "the first question is whether the degeneracy of the eigenvalues is removed and the jordan block structure is broken in the @xmath58 perturbation theory . at first glance",
    ", it appears that the degeneracy and the jordan block structure should remain , because we know that the difference between the two eigenvalues for finite @xmath56 is of the order @xmath1484 , which appears to be out of reach of the perturbation theory .",
    "however , here we could in principle obtain the asymptotic expansion of this difference .",
    "it would be very interesting to analyze this perturbative expansion explicitly .",
    "it is important to understand to what extent the correlation functions of the quantum mechanical models at finite values of @xmath56 may be reconstructed from the correlation functions at @xmath146 by perturbation theory .",
    "here we consider the simplest non - trivial example , which suggests that this may indeed be done successfully .",
    "let @xmath121 and consider the two - point functions of the form @xmath1485 as in section  [ their factorization ] .",
    "according to formula , the value of this correlation function at @xmath146 is equal to the integral @xmath1486 and to the matrix element @xmath1487 for finite values of @xmath56 this correlation function is given by the formula @xmath1488 where @xmath1470 and @xmath1482 ( acting on functions ) are given by formulas and .",
    "now we use the expansion formula @xmath1489 together with formulas for @xmath1490 and @xmath1491 found in section  [ their factorization ] and the formulas for the action of @xmath1470 and @xmath1482 on @xmath1417 found in the previous section , this gives us an explicit perturbative @xmath58-expansion for the two - point correlation function @xmath1485 .",
    "the same analysis may be applied to @xmath145-point correlation functions of evaluation observables .",
    "we find that each term of the corresponding @xmath58-expansion is given by a finite integral of a matrix element of these operators acting on the space of states at @xmath146 .",
    "thus , in principle all of the corresponding @xmath58 perturbation series are computable",
    ". it would be interesting to relate these perturbation series to the actual correlation functions in the theories at finite values of @xmath56 computed by other methods .",
    "up to now we have considered the limit @xmath324 of the supersymmetric model of quantum mechanics defined by the action .",
    "there are also analogous non - supersymmetric models , and many of our results may be applied to those models as well .",
    "the simplest way to break supersymmetry is to consider fermions taking values in vector bundles on @xmath2 that are different from the tangent and cotangent bundles .",
    "since we have assumed @xmath2 to be khler , we have chiral fermions : @xmath1492 , taking values in the holomorphic cotangent and tangent bundles on @xmath2 , respectively , and anti - chiral fermions , @xmath1493 , taking values in the holomorphic cotangent and tangent bundles on @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we may now stipulate that @xmath1492 take values in vector bundles @xmath1153 and @xmath1494 , respectively , whereas @xmath1493 take values in vector bundles @xmath1495 and @xmath1496 , respectively .",
    "the vector bundle @xmath1497 need not be complex conjugate to @xmath1153 , thus allowing the possibility of `` heterotic '' quantum mechanical models , which are the precursors of the sigma models appearing in heterotic string .",
    "the bosonic part of the action remains the same as before : @xmath1498 where @xmath1499 is a holomorphic vector field .",
    "we will again assume that @xmath9 is the gradient vector field of a morse function @xmath11 on @xmath2 and that @xmath4 comes from a holomorphic @xmath5-action on @xmath2 .",
    "to write down the fermionic part of the action , we need to assume in addition that the @xmath5-action on @xmath2 may be lifted to @xmath1153 and @xmath1495 , i.e. , that @xmath1153 and @xmath1495 are @xmath5-equivariant vector bundles on @xmath2 . then if we choose local trivialization of @xmath1153 by local sections @xmath1500 and a local trivialization of @xmath1495 by local sections @xmath1501 , the generator of the one - dimensional lie algebra of @xmath5 will act by the formula @xmath1502 for example , in the case when @xmath1153 and @xmath1495 are the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic cotangent bundles of @xmath2 , we have bases of sections @xmath1503 and @xmath1504 , and so @xmath1505 , @xmath1506 . now the fermionic part of the action is @xmath1507 here @xmath1508 and @xmath1509 are the covariant derivatives corresponding to chosen connections on @xmath1153 and @xmath1495 , which may however be absorbed into the momenta @xmath1510 and @xmath1511 in the same way as in the supersymmetric model ( see section  [ pi and grad ] ) .    the definition of the corresponding path integral for general vector bundles @xmath1153 and @xmath1495 requires special care because the space of fields does not carry a canonical integration measure as in the supersymmetric case .",
    "we will discuss this question in part iii of this article . here",
    "we will only point out that our results on the hamiltonian description of the supersymmetric model have obvious generalizations to the non - supersymmetric case .",
    "we again have spaces of `` in '' and `` out '' states , @xmath1203 and @xmath1512 .",
    "the space @xmath1203 is isomorphic to the direct sum of spaces @xmath1135 labeled by the fixed points @xmath92 of the @xmath5-action , as in the supersymmetric case .",
    "each @xmath1135 exhibits holomorphic factorization : @xmath1513 , where @xmath1514 ( compare with formula ) . the hamiltonian is the vector field @xmath90 .",
    "the action of @xmath4 and @xmath261 is given by formulas similar to and , in which the gc operators are @xmath1515 and @xmath1516 for @xmath1058 .",
    "the space of `` out '' states has a similar structure , with the ascending manifolds @xmath88 replaced by the descending manifolds @xmath662 .",
    "in addition , we need to replace @xmath1153 by @xmath1517 and @xmath1495 by @xmath1518 , where @xmath1519 and @xmath1520 are the line bundles of holomorphic and anti - holomorphic top forms , respectively .",
    "an interesting special class of models arises if we let @xmath1495 be the anti - holomorphic cotangent bundle on @xmath2 , as in the supersymmetric model .",
    "then we retain the anti - chiral supercharge @xmath219 .",
    "the corresponding `` half - supersymmetric '' models may therefore be viewed as quantum mechanical analogues of the @xmath220 supersymmetric sigma models ( just like the fully supersymmetric model may be viewed as an analogue of the @xmath1521 supersymmetric sigma model ) . in such models it is interesting to compute the cohomology of the supercharge @xmath219 , which may be viewed as a `` baby version '' of the cohomology of the right moving supercharge in the @xmath220 sigma models .",
    "this cohomology has been studied in @xcite , where it was shown that it is closely related to the chiral differential operators .    in the `` half - supersymmetric '' quantum mechanical model",
    "the supercharge @xmath219 is given by the same formula as in the supersymmetric case , except that we need to replace the gc operators @xmath117 and @xmath118 by @xmath1522 and @xmath1523 , respectively .",
    "the argument of section  [ coh of q ] for the computation of the @xmath219-cohomology in the supersymmetric case carries over verbatim to this case , and we find that the first term of the corresponding spectral sequence is just the gc complex @xmath1524 of the vector bundle @xmath1525 ( see section  [ coh of q ] for the definition of this complex ) .",
    "actually , the grading on the exterior algebra @xmath1526 is preserved by the differential , so the gc complex decomposes into a direct sum of its subcomplexes @xmath1527 .",
    "this gives a second grading on the cohomology of @xmath219 .",
    "this cohomology is therefore equal to the direct sum of the ( dolbeault ) cohomologies of the sheaves of holomorphic sections of the vector bundles @xmath1528 : @xmath1529 thus , we find an effective way for computing the cohomology of the anti - chiral supercharge in the `` half - supersymmetric '' quantum mechanical models .",
    "the result is that this cohomology is nothing but the dolbeault cohomology of the bundle @xmath1526 , where the chiral fermions take values .",
    "this result is closely related to the work of e. witten on the holomorphic morse theory . in @xcite witten",
    "has shown how to adopt his approach to morse theory from @xcite ( discussed in section  [ recollections morse ] ) , which allows one to compute the de rham cohomology of @xmath2 in terms of an instanton complex associated to a morse function , to the computation of the cohomology of the sheaf of holomorphic sections of a @xmath5-equivariant vector bundle @xmath1153 on @xmath2 ( in other words , computing dolbeault cohomology instead of de rham cohomology ) .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath2 is a khler manifold equipped with a morse function @xmath11 whose gradient satisfies the conditions listed above .",
    "witten has shown that this cohomology may be obtained as the cohomology of a certain complex .",
    "the groups of this complex are infinite - dimensional , but they are graded by the action of @xmath5 and the corresponding graded components are finite - dimensional .",
    "witten has computed in @xcite the characters of the groups of this complex .",
    "this enabled him to write down `` holomorphic morse inequalities '' giving estimates on the dolbeault cohomology of @xmath1153 in the same way as the usual morse inequalities give us estimates on the de rham cohomology of @xmath2 .",
    "it was subsequently shown by s. wu in @xcite that the characters that witten had computed were precisely the characters of the groups of the gc complex @xmath1530 of @xmath1153 .",
    "therefore it was suggested in @xcite that witten s holomorphic instanton complex should be interpreted as the gc complex of @xmath1153 .",
    "this is in agreement with witten s result , because we know that the cohomology of the gc complex is equal to the dolbeault cohomology of @xmath1153 .",
    "but the connection of this complex to quantum mechanics still remained a mystery .",
    "but now we have found a natural explanation of the connection between the gc complex and quantum mechanics .",
    "namely , we have shown that the gc complexes naturally appear in the framework of the `` half - supersymmetric '' quantum mechanical models in the limit @xmath146 .",
    "we have found that the dolbeault cohomology of a holomorphic @xmath5-equivariant line bundle on a compact khler manifold coincides with the cohomology of the supercharge @xmath219 on the space of `` in '' states of a particular model of this type : with left fermions living in @xmath1153 and right fermions living in the anti - holomorphic cotangent bundle .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the computation of the cohomology of @xmath219 naturally gives us the gc complex of @xmath1153 ( and even of @xmath1531 ) .",
    "this explains the connection between `` holomorphic morse theory '' and quantum mechanics .",
    "we want to point out a particularly interesting class of `` half - supersymmetric '' models of this type .",
    "they are associated to a flag variety @xmath1532 , where @xmath38 is a complex simple lie group and @xmath25 is its borel subgroup .",
    "this flag variety has a natural morse function : the hamiltonian of the vector field corresponding to a generic element of a maximal compact torus contained in @xmath25 .",
    "its critical points are parameterized by the weyl group @xmath1533 of @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding ascending manifolds are called the schubert cells , which we denote by @xmath1534 .",
    "its complex dimension is equal to the length of @xmath780 , denoted by @xmath1535 .",
    "we can choose the morse function in such a way that they are the @xmath25-orbits on @xmath1532 .",
    "note that if @xmath1536 , then @xmath1537 , and the corresponding morse function is the one we have studied extensively in the earlier sections .",
    "suppose that @xmath1153 is a line bundle on @xmath1532 .",
    "then it corresponds to an integral weight @xmath1538 of the group @xmath38 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath1538 is dominant , and so can be realized as the highest weight of an irreducible finite - dimensional representation @xmath1539 of @xmath38 .",
    "we denote the corresponding line bundle by @xmath1540 .",
    "the gc complex of this line bundle is studied in detail in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where it is shown that this complex coincides with the dual of the so - called bernstein - gelfand - gelfand ( bgg ) resolution of @xmath1539 .",
    "the @xmath193th group of the gc complex @xmath1541 is equal to @xmath1542    the group @xmath38 does not act on the gc complex @xmath1541 , but the lie algebra @xmath1543 does . under this action @xmath1544 the contragredient verma module over @xmath1543 of highest weight @xmath1545 , where @xmath1546 is the half - sum of positive roots of @xmath1543 .",
    "thus , the @xmath193th group of the gc complex is @xmath1547 and its cohomology is equal to @xmath1548 . according to the borel - weil - bott theorem , @xmath1549 and @xmath1550 , for @xmath1077 .",
    "therefore the gc complex @xmath1541 is a _ resolution _ of the irreducible representation @xmath1539 .",
    "it is dual to the bgg resolution , which is well - known in representation theory @xcite .",
    "is not dominant , then the cohomology is either zero or it occurs in a positive cohomological dimension ; in this case the @xmath1543-modules appearing in the complex are the twisted verma modules , see @xcite ]    according to the above discussion , this bgg resolution is naturally realized in the context of a `` half - supersymmetric '' model on @xmath1532 in which left fermions take values in the line bundle @xmath1551 and its dual .",
    "the cohomology of the supercharge @xmath219 in this model is therefore equal to @xmath1552 thus , we realize irreducible representations of simple lie groups as @xmath219-cohomologies of `` half - supersymmetric '' models on the flag variety .      up to now",
    "we have considered a morse function @xmath11 on a khler manifold @xmath2 of dimension @xmath145 and the corresponding gradient vector field @xmath399 which , as we have assumed , decomposes into the sum @xmath1553 of a holomorphic and anti - holomorphic vector fields generating a @xmath5-action on @xmath2 .",
    "the critical points of @xmath11 are the fixed points of this @xmath5-action .",
    "the assumption that @xmath11 is a morse function means that these points are isolated and non - degenerate . in this section",
    "we discuss briefly what happens if we are in a situation when the fixed points are not isolated and @xmath11 is a morse - bott function .",
    "let @xmath1554 , be the components of the fixed point set of the @xmath5-action on @xmath2 ( under our old assumptions , each @xmath1555 consisted of a single point ) . according to the results of @xcite , in this case @xmath2 still has decompositions , with @xmath88 and @xmath662 defined in the same way as before , by formulas and .",
    "however , in this case each @xmath88 is a @xmath5-equivariant holomorphic fibration over @xmath1555 , whose fibers are isomorphic to @xmath91 , where @xmath1556 is the number of positive eigenvalues of the hessian of @xmath11 at the points of @xmath1555 .",
    "moreover , locally over @xmath1555 the bundle @xmath88 is isomorphic to the subbundle of the normal bundle to @xmath1557 spanned by the eigenspaces of the hessian of the function @xmath11 with positive eigenvalues .",

    "consider , for example , the case of @xmath1118 with the @xmath5 action @xmath1559 , corresponding to the vector field @xmath1560 .",
    "then the fixed point set has two components : the point @xmath1561 and the one - dimensional component @xmath1562 isomorphic to @xmath123 .",
    "the corresponding strata @xmath1430 and @xmath1431 are the point @xmath1377 and its complement , respectively . note that @xmath1431 is a line bundle over @xmath123 isomorphic to @xmath1563 , which is also isomorphic to the normal bundle of @xmath1564 .",
    "the strata @xmath1565 and @xmath1566 are the plane @xmath1567 and @xmath1568 , respectively .",
    "the description of the spaces of `` in '' and `` out '' states of this model is similar to the one obtained previously in the morse function case .",
    "namely , @xmath1203 is isomorphic to the direct sum of the spaces @xmath1569 . roughly speaking ,",
    "each space @xmath1135 is the space of @xmath75 differential forms on @xmath1555 extended in two ways : by polynomial differential forms in the bundle directions of @xmath88 , and then by polynomials in the derivatives in the transversal directions to @xmath88 in @xmath2 .",
    "the ground states , on which the hamiltonian @xmath78 acts by zero , correspond to differential forms on @xmath1555 . given such a form @xmath863 ,",
    "let @xmath1570 be its pull - back to @xmath88 under the projection @xmath1571 .",
    "then @xmath1570 defines a `` delta - like '' distribution supported on @xmath88 , whose value on @xmath1572 is equal to @xmath1573 ( compare with formula ) .",
    "we will use the same notation @xmath1570 for these distributions .",
    "while these are the ground states of the model at @xmath146 , only those of them which correspond to harmonic differential forms @xmath1574 , may be deformed to ground states for finite values of @xmath56 .",

    "the definition of these distributions requires a regularization similar to the one we used in the case of isolated critical points .",
    "because of this regularization , we obtain non - trivial extensions between different spaces @xmath1135 , and the action of the hamiltonian is not diagonalizable . however , the formula for the hamiltonian is more complicated than in the case of isolated fixed points .",
    "another difference with the case of isolated fixed points is that we observe holomorphic factorization only in the fiber directions of the maps @xmath1571 , but not along the manifolds @xmath1555 themselves .    in the analysis we have performed so far we worked with the single - valued morse functions @xmath11 .",
    "morse theory has a generalization for non - simply connected manifolds , namely , the morse - novikov theory , in which @xmath11 is multivalued and only its differential is well - defined .",
    "however , according to the results of @xcite , under the assumptions that we have made : that @xmath2 is a compact khler manifold @xmath2 with a holomorphic vector field @xmath4 such that its zeros are isolated and the set of zeros is non - empty , we have @xmath1575 . therefore all closed one - forms on @xmath2 are exact .",

    "<S> many quantum field theories in one , two and four dimensions possess remarkable limits in which the instantons are present , the anti - instantons are absent , and the perturbative corrections are reduced to one - loop . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the corresponding models as full quantum field theories , beyond their topological sector . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the correlation functions of all , not only topological ( or bps ) , observables may be studied explicitly in these models , and the spectrum may be computed exactly . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature is that the hamiltonian is not always diagonalizable , but may have jordan blocks , which leads to the appearance of logarithms in the correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that in the models defined on khler manifolds the space of states exhibits holomorphic factorization . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in dimensions two and four our theories are logarithmic conformal field theories .    </S>",
    "<S> in part i we describe the class of models under study and present our results in the case of one - dimensional ( quantum mechanical ) models , which is quite representative and at the same time simple enough to analyze explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> part ii will be devoted to supersymmetric two - dimensional sigma models and four - dimensional yang - mills theory . </S>",
    "<S> in part iii we will discuss non - supersymmetric models .        itep - th-40/06  ihes - p/06/42 </S>"
