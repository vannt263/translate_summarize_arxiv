    "the fractional quantum hall effect has been one of the key topics in condensed matter physics for the last 15 years .",
    "while much of the experimental work on this phenomenon has been focussed on electrical transport measurements , recently attention has turned to the development of complementary spectroscopic techniques . in the case of both phonon@xcite and inelastic light scattering@xcite experiments the spectroscopic probe couples to the electronic density of the system and so naturally interacts with its collective density fluctuations .",
    "the theory of these collective modes was first developed by girvin , macdonald and platzman ( gmp)@xcite in a manner analogous to that used by feynman for the phonon and roton modes of superfluid helium .",
    "unlike the case of liquid helium , there is no gapless phonon - like behaviour at small wave vector ; the collective modes of the fractional quantum hall systems are gapped at all wavelengths : a consequence of the incompressibility of these states .",
    "however , in common with liquid helium , the collective mode dispersion does have a well defined minimum , hence the quanta of collective excitations of the fractional quantum hall states are referred to as magnetorotons .",
    "one can envision two types of process involved in both the phonon and light scattering experiments .",
    "firstly a magnetoroton can be created when the electron liquid absorbs one of the probe quanta ( phonon or photon ) , we refer to this as type a absorption .",
    "secondly , an existing magnetoroton can be scattered into a different state by the absorption of a probe quantum , this we call a type b process . at zero temperature the electron liquid will be in its ground state ( well described by laughlin s wave function@xcite ) and there will be no magnetorotons present , hence only the type a process can occur . because the magnetoroton dispersion is gapped at all wave vectors there is a threshold frequency for this process : no probe quantum can be absorbed whose energy is less than the minimum gap , @xmath0 .",
    "type b processes will occur at any non - zero temperature and have no threshold : in principal , arbitrarily small energies can be transferred to the electron liquid by these processes .",
    "the theory of the type a processes has been discussed by he and platzman @xcite for the inelastic light - scattering case and by our group @xcite for the phonon case .",
    "these type b processes will determine the leading finite - temperature corrections to the zero temperature theory outlined in @xcite .",
    "the theory of type b processes is less well developed but potentially rather important for the understanding of the phonon experiments because these typically use pulses containing a black body distribution of phonon energies characterized by a pulse temperature @xmath1 and use the temperature of the electron liquid itself to monitor the rate of phonon absorption . at an arbitrary electron temperature there will be competition between rare type a processes in which high energy phonons are absorbed and common type b processes in which low energy phonons are absorbed . in recent time - resolved experiments@xcite the change in electron temperature is recorded over the period of time in which the pulse is in contact with the electrons . at early times",
    "the electron liquid is at very low temperatures and so type a processes will dominate the energy transfer and hence the rate of change of electron temperature . at later times",
    "the electron temperature will be higher , because of all the earlier type a absorptions and type b processes will become comparable in determining the energy transfer rate .    the purpose of this paper is to derive a sum rule obeyed by the matrix elements which control the rates for the type b processes and to use this to test the best existing approximation scheme for this object : the colvolution approximation developed for studying the corresponding quantities for superfluid helium-4 @xcite . as discussed in @xcite , these matrix elements are also important for the understanding of the effects of disorder on the form of the magnetoroton dispersion . in all of the following ,",
    "natural units in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the bulk dielectric constant of the material in which the 2des is formed ) are used .",
    "girvin , macdonald and platzman@xcite supposed that the low - lying collective excitations of a fractional quantum hall fluid could be obtained in a manner analogous to that used by feynman in his classic works on superfluid helium .",
    "they proposed that a collective excitation with 2d wave vector @xmath5 would be described by the wave function @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ground state of the system ( for which laughlin has provided an excellent wave function , at least for the cases where the landau level filling @xmath8 is of the form @xmath9 for @xmath10 odd ) and @xmath11 is an operator that is derived from the conventional density operator @xmath12 by projection onto the lowest landau level . in the notation used by macdonald in @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 acts on the hilbert space of a single electron to project out the states within the lowest ( spin - polarized ) landau level .",
    "girvin and jach@xcite investigated the properties of these projected operators and , in particular deduced that @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "this leads , bearing in mind that the projection operators for one particle commute with operators associated with the other , to the commutation relation for the projected density operators @xmath17 & = \\left ( e^{\\mathsf{k}^{\\ast}\\mathsf{q}/2}-e^{\\mathsf{q}^{\\ast}\\mathsf{k}% /2}\\right ) \\overline{\\rho}_{\\mathbf{k+q } }   \\notag \\\\ & = i\\phi\\left ( \\mathbf{k , q}\\right ) \\overline{\\rho}_{\\mathbf{k+q}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18    the normalization in equation [ roton ] includes a matrix element which has the form of a projected static structure factor @xmath19 gmp showed that this could be related to the true static structure factor @xmath20 via the simple relation @xmath21 the magnetoroton energy can be written in the form @xmath22",
    "\\right| \\omega\\right\\rangle   } { n\\overline{s}\\left ( k\\right ) }   \\notag \\\\ & = \\frac{\\overline{f}\\left ( k\\right ) } { \\overline{s}\\left ( k\\right ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and gmp showed that the projected oscillator strength , @xmath23 , can be written explicitly as an integral involving @xmath24 and @xmath25 only .",
    "hence , obtaining @xmath26 from the laughlin wave function , they found the dispersion relation for these excitations .",
    "consider now a bosonic probe quantum ( such as a phonon or photon ) labelled by a 3d wave vector @xmath27 which couples to the 2d electrons via a hamiltonian of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 annihilates a probe quantum with the given wave vector , @xmath30 is the electron density operator described above ( un - projected ) and @xmath31 is some coupling function . for the detailed forms of @xmath32 relevant to the experimental systems see @xcite .",
    "the probability per unit time for a magnetoroton initially in a state @xmath33 to absorb a probe quantum with wave vector @xmath27 and be scattered into the state @xmath34 is given by fermi s golden rule as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the energy of the probe quantum .",
    "this , as usual with lowest order perturbation theory , factorizes nicely into a part which depends on the well characterized details of the probe and the material in which the 2des is formed and a part that only involves the states of the correlated 2d electrons . the relevant matrix element in the latter is @xmath37 where we have replaced @xmath30 with its projected counterpart by virtue of the idempotence of the projection operators and we define the three - point correlation function @xmath38 .",
    "we can deduce two symmetry properties of @xmath39 straightforwardly .",
    "firstly we can use the fact that @xmath40 to deduce that @xmath41    secondly we can use the commutation relation for the projected density operators , as derived by girvin and jach@xciteto simplify @xmath42 \\right| \\omega\\right\\rangle   \\notag \\\\ & = i\\phi\\left ( \\mathbf{q , k}\\right ) \\frac{1}{n}\\left\\langle",
    "\\omega\\left|   \\overline{\\rho}_{\\mathbf{-k - q}}\\overline{\\rho}_{\\mathbf{k+q}}\\right| \\omega\\right\\rangle   \\notag \\\\ & = i\\phi\\left ( \\mathbf{q , k}\\right ) \\overline{s}\\left ( \\left| \\mathbf{k+q}% \\right| \\right ) \\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in order to show the basic idea of the method we will begin with a simple case and prove a sum - rule for the projected structure factor itself . from the work of gmp @xcite",
    "we know that @xmath43 in first quantized notation we have that , for a system of @xmath44 particles @xmath45 hence we have that @xmath46 now @xmath47 so that @xmath48 inserting a representation of unity in terms of the complete set of @xmath44-particle position eigenstates @xmath49 gives @xmath50 the only configurations that could contribute to this integral are those in which two particles co - incide . such configurations , however , have zero weight because of the pauli exclusion principle . hence we conclude that @xmath51 from this we find , straightforwardly that @xmath52 or @xmath53 of course , this result can be derived more simply by noting that @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the radial distribution function . hence @xmath56 the pauli principle ensures that @xmath57 so that we again recover our sum - rule .",
    "now let us derive our principal result : a sum rule for the three point correlation function .",
    "as shown by macdonald et al.@xcite , the three point correlation function can be written in the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 once again , @xmath60 is the complex representation of the vector @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the un - projected three point correlation function of the quantum liquid .",
    "we wish to find a sum rule of the form @xmath63 the term that is likely to cause us difficulty is the un - projected three point function , however @xmath64 e^{i\\mathbf{% k\\cdot r}_{n}}\\left| \\omega\\right\\rangle \\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sum over @xmath65 is simply a delta function , so that @xmath66 but , as seen above , this must be identically zero , the only configurations for which the delta - function is non - zero are ones for which the ground state wave function vanishes by virtue of the pauli exclusion principle . hence @xmath67@xmath68 .",
    "the remaining terms are simplified by noting that @xmath69 and by removing possible singularities by writing @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath55 is the usual radial distribution function of the electron liquid .",
    "hence we are left with @xmath72 as shown below in the appendix the summations can be carried out in the limit @xmath73 , @xmath74  to give @xmath75 which is our desired sum - rule .",
    "we can use the symmetry properties derived above to derive a second version of this . consider",
    "@xmath76 it is shown in the appendix that this integral vanishes so that @xmath77 finally the reality of the right - hand side of [ sum rule ] allows a further form of the sum - rule to be written as @xmath78    the basic idea used here could be extended to consider sum - rules for higher order correlation functions were they to be of interest .",
    "in their work macdonald et al .",
    "@xcite estimated the small @xmath65 behaviour of @xmath39 by using the convolution approximation@xcite for the 3-particle distribution function @xmath79 which can be written as @xmath80 the three - point function , @xmath81 can be written as @xmath82 which gives , using the convolution approximation @xmath83 h\\left ( \\left| \\mathbf{% k+q}\\right| \\right ) \\qquad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this approximation improves on the standard kirkwood decoupling in that it correctly gives the @xmath84 limit as @xmath85 since @xmath86 saturates our sum - rule we expect that @xmath87 using the convolution form gives @xmath88 now @xmath89 so that @xmath90 this final integral requires a specific form for the pair correlation function , @xmath91 . for the primary fractional quantum hall states ( @xmath92 , for odd @xmath10 )",
    "this is known from monte - carlo studies of the laughlin wave function @xcite which lead to the form @xmath93 where the @xmath94 co - efficients are tabulated in @xcite .",
    "we have estimated @xmath95 numerically for the case @xmath96 and it is plotted in figure 1 , along with a plot of @xmath97 for comparison . clearly @xmath95 is not identically zero and is not even negligible in comparison to @xmath97 .",
    "hence we deduce that this approximation is deficient .",
    "macdonald et al.@xcite themselves pointed out that this approximation could well be unreliable as it does not correctly reflect the particle - hole symmetry @xmath98 of the system .",
    "in this short note we have derived a sum rule ( with symmetry related variants ) for the static structure factor and the three - point correlation function that will determine the leading finite - temperature corrections to the absorption rates of phonons and photons in spectroscopic studies of the fractional quantum hall effect . in principle",
    "the approach followed would allow the formulation of similar sum - rules for higher order correlation functions should such objects ever become relevant to experimental work .",
    "the sum - rule for the three - point function has been used to assess the validity of the convolution approximation @xcite for fractional quantum hall systems and has shown that it does not capture all of the physics .    _",
    "this work was supported by the epsrc ( uk ) . _",
    "first of all we need to evaluate the following integral for later use : @xmath99 now @xcite @xmath100 so that @xmath101 now we need to evaluate @xmath102 in the limit @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 this becomes @xmath106 similarly @xmath107 the final integral can be evaluated quite generally .",
    "@xmath108 now for any spin - polarized fermi system @xmath109 as @xmath110 as a consequence of the pauli principle , hence @xmath111 and @xmath112    finally we need to evaluate @xmath113 as we have already seen the @xmath114 integral vanishes and so , therefore does the whole expression",
