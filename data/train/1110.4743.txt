    "in a previous article ( see @xcite ) , by introducing the `` similarity '' relation and applying it to the restricted three - body problem , the `` similar '' equations of motion were obtained .",
    "these equations were connected with the classical equations of motion by some coordinate transformation relations ( see equations ( 17 ) in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "were also defined similar parameters and physical quantities , and similar initial conditions and some trajectories of the test particles into the physical @xmath0 and respectively @xmath1 planes were ploted .    denoting @xmath2 and @xmath3 the components of the binary system ( whose masses are @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , the equations of motion of the test particle ( in the frame of the restricted three - body problem ) in the coordinate system @xmath6 are ( see equations ( 11)-(13 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    where @xmath10    in the similar coordinate system @xmath11 the equations of motion of the test particle are ( see equations ( 14)-(16 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    where @xmath15    it can be easily verify that the equations of coordinate transformation are : @xmath16    one can observes that equations ( 1)-(3 ) and ( 5)-(7 ) have singularities in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these situations correspond to collision of the test particle whith @xmath2 or @xmath3 in a straight line .",
    "the collision is due to the nature of the newtonian gravitational force ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "if the test particle approaches to one of the primaries very closely ( @xmath22 ) , then such an event produces large gravitational force ( @xmath23 ) and sharp bends of the orbit .",
    "the removing of these singularities can be done by regularization .",
    "( remark : the purpose of regularization is to obtain regular equations of motion , no regular solutions . )",
    "euler seems to be the first ( in 1765 ) to propose regularizing transformations when studying the motion of three bodies on a straight line ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the regularization method has become popular in recent years ( see @xcite ) for long term studies of the motion of celestial bodies .",
    "these problems have a special merit in astronomy , because with their help we can studied more efficient the equations of motions with singularities . at the collision",
    "the equations of motion possess singularities .",
    "the problem of singularities plays an important role under computational , physical and conceptual aspects ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the singularities occurring at collisions can be eliminated by the proper choice of the independent variable .",
    "the basic idea of regularization procedure is to compensate for the infinite increase of the velocity at collision .",
    "for this reason , a new independent variable , fictitious time , is adopted .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are regularized by two transformations : the time transformation and the coordinate transformation .",
    "the most important part of the regularization is the time transformation , when a new fictitious time is used , in order to slow the motion near the singularities .",
    "the regularization can be local or global .",
    "if a local regularization is done , then the time and the coordinates transformations eliminate only one of the two singularities .",
    "an example for the local regularization is the birkhoff s transformation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the global regularization eliminates both singularities at once ( see @xcite ) . because our singularities are given in terms of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , in this paper a global regularization",
    "will be done .    in order to do this ,",
    "we need to replace the cartesian equations ( 1)-(3 ) and ( 5)-(7 ) with the corresponding canonical equations of motion .",
    "the canonical coordinates are formed by generalized coordinates @xmath28 and generalized momenta @xmath29 .",
    "the hamiltonian , defined by the equation : @xmath30 will becomes ( see @xcite p. 266",

    "several regularizing methods are known ( see stiefel et al . 1971 ) . in this paper",
    "we shall use the levi - civita s method , applied when the bodies are moving on a plane .",
    "the two steps performed in the process of regularization of the restricted problem are the introduction of new coordinates and the transformation of time .",
    "the combination of the coordinate ( dependent variable ) transformation and the time ( independent variable ) transformation have an analytical importance and increase the numerical accuracy . for simplicity we shall consider that the third body moves into the orbital plane .",

    "then , the geometrical transformation go away the trajectory from the points where there are singularities .    in what concern the time transformation , as one can see in figure 1e and 1f ,",
    "the role of this transformation is to slow - down the motion of the test particle . with thin line",
    "is represented the trajectory of the test particle when the time integration is @xmath166 , and with thick line is represented the trajectory of the test particle when the time integration is @xmath167 .",
    "as one can see , after @xmath167 we are still far away from the point where it is possible to have a singularity , if the coordinate system has the origin in @xmath2 , but not so far away if the origin of the coordinate system is in @xmath3 .",
    "this paper continue the study of the relation of similarity , postulated in @xcite , by applying it to the levi - civita s regularization of the motion s equations of the test particle , in the circular , restricted three - body problem .",
    "many papers in the last decade have studied the restricted three - body system in a phase space . during these studies ,",
    "difficulties have arisen when the system approaches a close encounter .",
    "using the regularization method in the similar coordinates system , we give explicitly equations of motion for the test particle .",
    "we study numerically the regular equations of motion , we written in canonical form , and obtained that the integrator using regularized equations of motion are more efficient .",
    "the similar hamiltonian ( see eq . ( 22 ) ) give us the similar canonical equations ( 27)-(32 ) , which have some different signes than the canonical equation ( 16)-(21 ) .",
    "the coordinate transformation used in the levi - civita s regularization create a new form of the similar hamiltonian s equations ( eqs .",
    "finally , the time transformation used in the levi - civita s regularization gives us the regularized equations of motion ( 51 ) in the coordinate system with origin in @xmath2 , and ( 54 ) in the similar coordinate system .",
