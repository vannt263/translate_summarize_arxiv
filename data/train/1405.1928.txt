    "the mechanical and electronic properties of graphene make it an attractive candidate for use in the electronics industry , and indeed it has even been speculated that it could one day replace silicon as the primary material used.@xcite in addition , it exhibits several exotic properties , such as a room temperature quantum hall effect.@xcite many of the interesting electronic properties of single - layer graphene arise from the presence in the band structure of dirac cones at the k points in the brillouin zone that touch at the fermi level @xmath3 , as a result of which electrons behave like massless dirac fermions.@xcite    when graphite or multilayer graphene is assembled by arranging single graphene layers in the conventional bernal stacking , also referred to as ab - stacking , where successive layers are displaced by both a vertical and a lateral shift , many of the unique properties of single - layer graphene , such as the dirac cones , disappear .",
    "however , in recent years there has been the appealing discovery that if instead a few layers of graphene are grown so that successive layers are aligned with a twist with respect to each other , there then appears to be an effective electronic decoupling between layers , so that the dirac cones are maintained , at least for large angles of twist.@xcite twisted bilayer graphene has also been shown to have other intriguing properties , e.g. , for small angles of twist , there is a reduction in the fermi velocity , and a localization of electrons , and one can bring van hove singularities in the electronic density of states very close to the fermi level.@xcite this in turn raises the possibility of seeing other interesting phenomena such as superconductivity .",
    "other fascinating results on tblg include the demonstration of hofstadter s butterfly in the energy spectrum in a magnetic field,@xcite and neutrino - like oscillations as a result of coupling of the dirac cones of the two rotated layers.@xcite graphene layers with a twist can now be grown by a variety of methods , which allow one to access a range of twist angles .",
    "@xcite however , the nature and extent of the interlayer coupling , and the consequences thereof , continue to be debated.@xcite    the question then arises : in what way are these properties altered upon the introduction of defects in tblg ? there has always been a lot of interest in defects in graphene and other low - dimensional carbon materials.@xcite much of this interest stems from concerns about how the presence of such defects will affect the functioning of these materials in applications .",
    "defects such as monovacancies , divacancies , interstitials and stone - wales defects@xcite are known to affect the mechanical , electronic and magnetic properties of carbon materials . there",
    "have , for example , been several studies to check to what extent the presence of defects affects electrical conductance.@xcite however , it has also been appreciated that it might be possible to purposely design defective structures with a view toward creating certain functionalities.@xcite among the possible advantages that the presence of defects in graphene can confer , it has been shown that they can induce magnetic moments,@xcite and improve gas sensing properties.@xcite it has also been suggested that the introduction of defects can be used for band - gap engineering.@xcite defects can be deliberately created by , e.g. , irradiation with electrons@xcite or ions,@xcite oxidation,@xcite hydrogenation,@xcite or fluorination.@xcite    in this theoretical study we perform density functional theory ( dft ) calculations to study the properties of two kinds of point defects : stone - wales defects ( sw ) and monovacancies in twisted bilayer graphene .",
    "we are particularly interested in the question of how the electronic band structure in the neighborhood of @xmath3 ( i.e. , the dirac cones ) are affected by the presence of defects .",
    "our spin - polarized dft calculations were performed using the pwscf package of the quantum espresso distribution.@xcite ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite were used to describe the interactions between the ion cores and valence electrons .",
    "a plane wave basis set was used , with kinetic energy cut - offs of @xmath4 ry and @xmath5 ry for the wavefunctions and charge densities , respectively .",
    "we have considered two different levels of approximation for the exchange - correlation interactions : ( i ) the local density approximation ( lda ) in the perdew - zunger form , @xcite and ( ii ) the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) form.@xcite many of the previous dft studies on tblg made use of the lda .",
    "however , given that the ( weak ) coupling between the two graphene layers is important in tblg , and that there has been much debate about its nature and extent , we feel that it is desirable to have an accurate treatment of these interlayer interactions , where van der waals interactions ( which are absent in conventional dft calculations ) may be expected to play a crucial role . for this reason , along with the pbe exchange - correlation , we also incorporate the van der waals interactions as a semi - empirical correction , using the  dft - d2 \" treatment suggested by grimme.@xcite of the three kinds of theoretical treatments used in this paper ( lda , pbe and dft - d2 ) , we believe that those results using dft - d2 should be regarded as being the most reliable , and most of our results have been obtained using this approach . however , we also present some results with the other two treatments for purposes of comparison ; we believe that this is of interest since several authors still continue to use these other functionals , especially lda , in order to treat such systems , and it is therefore worth examining their reliability .",

    "@xcite the derivation of the commensuration condition and the construction of the commensurate unit cell for an arbitrary set of angles between the two graphene layers is described below .",

    "[ fig : tblg ] ) .",
    "however , most of our calculations have been performed using a larger unit cell @xmath39 , which has lattice vectors that are twice as long : @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this unit cell contains 56 atoms in each layer , i.e. , 112 atoms in the bilayer unit cell ; this corresponds to the choice @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "it is important to also have a knowledge of the structure of the reciprocal space of tblg , in order to gain an understanding of its electronic properties .",
    "if @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the reciprocal lattice vectors corresponding to the unrotated layer , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the reciprocal lattice vectors corresponding to the rotated layer , the reciprocal lattice vectors of the tblg are given by :    @xmath58 @xmath59    and @xmath60 @xmath61    thus , @xmath62 @xmath63    and @xmath64 @xmath65    the reciprocal lattice and the first brillouin zone for the unrotated and rotated layers , and the twisted bilayer graphene , are shown in fig .  [ fig : tblg - fbz ] . the first brillouin zone for the tblg ( shown by the black hexagon in fig .",
    "[ fig : tblg - fbz ] ) corresponds to a twist angle of @xmath66 , for the smallest commensurate supercell @xmath8 .",
    "a similar figure can be obtained when @xmath39 is used ; this is provided in the supplementary material for easy reference .",
    "note that by the translational symmetry of the lattice , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are identical ; similarly , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are identical . if , in addition , one has inversion symmetry or time - reversal symmetry , then all six @xmath73 points are identical",
    "however , these symmetries are valid at the corners of the brillouin zone only , and need not necessarily hold in the interior of the brillouin zone , i.e. , one need not have three - fold or six - fold symmetry always present . in particular , the introduction of defects may lower the symmetry .",
    "the @xmath74 and @xmath75 points in the brillouin zone of the unrotated layer can be folded onto points in the first brillouin zone of the tblg lattice :    @xmath76    @xmath77    and    @xmath78    @xmath79    similarly for the rotated layer ,    @xmath80    @xmath81    and    @xmath82    @xmath83    thus , * * k**@xmath84 folds onto @xmath85 , * * k**@xmath86 or * * k**@xmath87 , depending on whether ( @xmath88 ) is @xmath89 , @xmath90 or @xmath91 , respectively .",

    "thus , these are the points whose vicinity we will focus on , to see whether the introduction of defects opens up a band gap and/or alters the linear dispersion relation .",
    "we consider two types of point defects in tblg , viz .",
    ", the stone - wales defect and the monovacancy .",
    "we primarily work with the supercell @xmath39 which is @xmath97 times as large as the supercell @xmath8 .",
    "for both the stone - wales defect and the monovacancy , we perform calculations considering all possible inequivalent sites of one defect in the @xmath39 supercell .",
    "this corresponds to one defect in a supercell of 56 carbon atoms per layer , i.e. , a defect density of 1.8% . for the monovacancy ,",
    "we have in addition considered defect densities of 7.2% ( corresponding to one vacancy in the @xmath8 supercell with 14 carbon atoms in each layer ) and 0.8% ( corresponding to one defect in supercell @xmath98 , which is @xmath99 times as large as @xmath8 , and contains 126 carbon atoms in each layer ) .",
    "for comparison of various properties of the above - mentioned defects in tblg , we also consider the same defects in a single layer of graphene ( slg ) , as well as in an ab - stacked bilayer graphene ( we refer to this as ab - blg ) . to facilitate comparison ,",

    "recent work has shown that it is possible to create multiple dirac cones by artificially engineering a lateral periodic potential by creating a superlattice.@xcite    creating a monovacancy in one layer of tblg shifts up the dirac cone of the other layer by @xmath1 ev , due to a combination of the requirement of the equilbration of the fermi energies , charge transfer and chemical interaction between the sheets . both sw defects and monovacancies increase the density of states at @xmath3 ; this should be of relevance to transport properties .",
    "the monovacancy defect in tblg leads to a magnetic defect state , very similar to the case of monovacancy defect in slg and ab - blg .",
    "a sharp magnetic defect state is the signature of the monovacancy , and arises from the dangling @xmath134-bond on one of the nearest neighbor atoms of the vacant site .",
    "the defect has a magnetic moment of @xmath106 1.2  2.0 @xmath152 , depending on the defect density . the scattering of the @xmath135-states of the defective layer results in a highly spin - polarized density of states at the fermi energy , both in the case of slg and tblg .",
    "the spin - polarized states in the vicinity of the fermi energy are widespread in spatial extent , thus raising the possibility of a large spin - polarization of the current in the defective layer .    by comparing results obtained with the lda , gga ( pbe ) and dft - d2 methods , we find that the pbe alone ( i.e. , without van der waals interactions incorporated ) is generally inadequate to describe bilayer graphene in general , and tblg in particular . in general ,",
    "both lda and dft - d2 give very similar results , with a few notable exceptions : dft - d2 gives a value for the exfoliation energy that is in closer agreement with experiment , and the two methods , while giving similar results for the net magnetic moment @xmath153 , give different values for the absolute magnetic moment @xmath141 for tblg with a monovacancy .",
