    "a simplified model of aggregation in two dimensions may be formulated as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be the closed disc of radius @xmath1 , with centre at the origin , and let @xmath2 be another closed disc , of diameter @xmath3 say , tangent to @xmath0 at a point chosen uniformly at random . set @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "write @xmath7 for the unique conformal isomorphism @xmath8 such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "suppose then that @xmath11 are independent and identically distributed copies of @xmath7 , and define @xmath12 the complementary sets @xmath13 form an increasing family and may be considered as a model of aggregation , where , for each @xmath14 , we add at time @xmath15 a new particle @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath17 is the image under the conformal map @xmath18 of a disc distributed as @xmath2 and independent of @xmath19 .",
    "since harmonic measure is invariant under conformal maps , conditional on @xmath19 , the random point at which @xmath17 is attached to @xmath19 is distributed on the boundary of @xmath19 according to the normalized harmonic measure from infinity . in this respect ,",
    "the model is appropriate for the aggregation of diffusive particles ` coming in from infinity ' .",
    "we note however that the added particle is distorted in a way depending on the current cluster @xmath19 .    in this paper",
    ", we identify a scaling limit for the restrictions to the boundary of @xmath20 of the maps @xmath21 , for @xmath22 , as @xmath23 and @xmath24 in a suitable way .",
    "this can be thought of as identifying the time - evolution of the total harmonic measure carried by the various ` fingers ' of the growing cluster .",
    "the limit is not sensitive to the shape of the first added particle : although we specified discs in the description above , the same sort of limit applies more generally .",
    "the limit object is the flow of coalescing brownian motions on the circle , also known as the brownian web .",
    "a brief review of related work is given next , followed by some illustrations of typical clusters , for certain cases of the model . from section [ lfc ] on ,",
    "we confine our attention to the restrictions of maps to the boundary of @xmath20 , generalizing at the same time to a natural class of l ' evy random flows on the circle .",
    "we first show a weak convergence result for the time - evolutions of finitely many points . in section [ cbf ]",
    "we describe a new canonical space for the coalescing brownian flow .",
    "then , in section [ skor ] , a larger flow - space , of skorokhod type , is introduced .",
    "this is a complete separable metric space suitable for the formulation of weak convergence of stochastic flows which are not necessarily continuous in time or space .",
    "the convergence of l ' evy flows to the coalescing brownian flow , is shown in section [ mr ] .",
    "time reversal of flows is discussed in section [ tr ] .",
    "then , in section [ model ] , convergence results for the aggregation model are deduced as corollaries of the convergence of l ' evy flows .",
    "some technical details are left to an appendix , where we discuss , in particular , the relation between our formulation of the coalescing brownian flow and the brownian webs of fontes et al .",
    "it is straightforward to define a finite family of ( standard ) brownian motions in one dimension , with given space - time starting points , independent until they collide , and coalescing on collision .",
    "the possibility to extend such a model to a space - time continuum of starting points was shown by arratia in 1979 in his phd thesis @xcite , where the model was considered as a limit object for coalescing random walks on the integers .",
    "subsequent work has been carried out by many people including harris @xcite , who was interested in general coalescing stochastic flows , and piterbarg @xcite , who showed that arratia s flow arises as a weak limit of rescaled isotropic stochastic flows .",
    "further properties were developed by tth and werner @xcite in 1998 , who used the flow to contruct an object which they called the ` continuous true self - repelling motion ' .",
    "tsirelson @xcite studied arratia s flow , formulated in terms of @xmath25-spaces , rather than pathwise , as an example in the general theory of stochastic flows .",
    "fontes , isopi , newman and ravishankar @xcite introduced the name ` brownian web ' in 2004 , to describe a number of new formulations of arratia s flow , and gave further characterization and convergence results .",
    "the paper @xcite characterizes the brownian web as a random element of a space of compact collections of paths with specified starting points .    in this paper",
    "we follow most closely the viewpoint of tth and werner but lay greater stress on the almost sure flow - type properties , formulating arratia s flow as a random variable in a certain complete separable metric space of continuous weak flows .",
    "we show that there is a unique borel probability measure on this space with respect to which all the @xmath26-point motions are coalescing brownian motions , and that this measure is invariant under time reversal .",
    "moreover , we show that any sequence of random such flows , all of whose @xmath26-point motions converge to coalescing brownian motions , converges to the coalescing brownian flow . the exact correspondence between our work and that in @xcite is discussed in the appendix .      our motivation for looking at the coalescing brownian flow arises from a surprising connection with planar random growth processes",
    "the simplest sorts of planar growth process to formulate take values in finite subsets of @xmath27 , starting from a singleton at the origin , and grow by the successive addition of sites adjacent to the present cluster , which are chosen according to some distribution determined by the present cluster . in 1961",
    ", eden @xcite introduced one such process , where the added site is simply chosen uniformly from all adjacent sites .",
    "this has been considered as a model for the growth of bacterial cells or tissue cultures of cells that are constrained from moving . in 1981 ,",
    "witten and sander @xcite put forward another such process , known as diffusion - limited aggregation or dla . here , particles perform random walks ` starting from infinity ' until they reach a site adjacent to the cluster .",
    "this site is then added to the cluster .",
    "dla is considered as a model for the formation of aggregates by deposition , such as soot particles .",
    "a family of further processes , indexed by a parameter @xmath28 $ ] and called dielectric - breakdown models , were discussed by niemeyer et al .",
    "@xcite . in these processes ,",
    "the random walk hitting probabilities on sites adjacent to the cluster are interpreted as an electric field @xmath29 ; the probabilities of attachment for new sites are then chosen proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "thus the case @xmath31 is the eden model and the case @xmath32 is dla .",
    "the primary interest in these and other related processes is in the asymptotic behaviour of large clusters .",
    "computational investigations reveal the emergence of complex structures , of fractal type , which sometimes appear a good match for observed phenomena",
    ". however , such investigations are highly sensitive to model variations and there are few notable mathematical results , with the exception of kesten s 1987 growth estimate @xcite for dla .",
    "moreover , the simulations appear to show that clusters depend on the fine lattice structure at large scales .",
    "this suggests that lattice - based processes may never properly model continuum phenomena .    in 1998 , hastings and levitov @xcite formulated a family of continuum growth models in terms of sequences of iterated conformal maps , indexed by a parameter @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "as in the model described in the introduction , they identify the cluster after the arrival of @xmath26 particles with a conformal map @xmath34 on @xmath20 , where , conditional on @xmath35 , the map @xmath36 corresponds to a particle attached at a random point @xmath37 on the unit circle , but now of radius @xmath38 .",
    "hastings and levitov argue , by comparing local growth rates , that their model can be related to lattice dielectric - breakdown by setting @xmath39 .",
    "further exploration of this relation is discussed in the survey paper by bazant and crowdy @xcite .",
    "carleson and makarov @xcite , in 2001 , obtained a growth estimate for a deterministic analogue of the dla model . in 2005 , rohde and zinsmeister @xcite considered the case @xmath40 in the hastings ",
    "levitov family .",
    "they established a scaling limit , in the case where the particle size is small ( but fixed ) , as the number of particles tends to infinity , and showed that the limit sets were one dimensional .",
    "they also gave estimates for the dimension of the limit sets in the case of general @xmath41 , and discussed limits of deterministic variants .",
    "we also consider the case @xmath40 but in the limiting regime where the particle diameter @xmath42 becomes small and the number of particles is of the order @xmath43 .",
    "we then show that the resulting flow map , restricted to points on the unit circle , converges to the coalescing brownian flow .",
    "in the introduction we described the construction of a sequence of iterated conformal maps that can be interpreted as a model of the aggregation of diffusive particles ` coming in from infinity ' .",
    "we chose the basic particle @xmath2 to be a closed disc of diameter @xmath3 .",
    "however our analysis turns out to apply to a wide range of basic particle shapes , as we shall see in section [ model ] .",
    "recall that @xmath20 denotes the complement of the closed unit disc @xmath0 in @xmath44 and @xmath45 denotes the complement of @xmath46 in @xmath44 , where @xmath6 .",
    "write @xmath7 for the conformal isomorphism @xmath8 fixing @xmath47 , with @xmath10 and write @xmath48 for the inverse isomorphism @xmath49 .",
    "denote the upper half - plane by @xmath50 .",
    "we now discuss briefly the form of @xmath48 for two particular choices of @xmath2 .",
    "the first of these , corresponding to the slit @xmath51 $ ] , was used to generate some realizations of the cluster for various values of @xmath42 , which are presented in figure [ dlafig ] .    for the slit ,",
    "we can obtain the map @xmath48 by composing the sequence of maps @xmath52\\to h\\to h\\to d_0,\\ ] ] given by @xmath53 here , we choose @xmath54 so that @xmath55 and choose @xmath56 so that @xmath57",
    ". then @xmath58 and @xmath59 , as required .",
    "the maps extend to the boundaries of their domains in obvious ways .",
    "in particular the boundary of the slit maps under @xmath48 to a boundary arc @xmath60 $ ] of the unit circle .",
    "note that @xmath61 and @xmath62 , from which we see that @xmath63    we observe in figure [ dlamany ] , when @xmath64 , that incoming particles are markedly distorted and , in particular , that particles arriving later tend to be larger .",
    "this effect is diminished when we examine smaller values of @xmath42 . in figure",
    "[ slit50 ] , the cluster is a rough ball , but with some sort of internal structure . the colours label arrivals in different epochs , showing that growth over time is uniform and there is a close relationship between time of arrival and the distance from the origin at which the particle sticks .",
    "figure [ flow50 ] focuses on the motion of points on the original circular boundary , which is the aspect of these simulations examined theoretically in this paper . the coalescing motion displayed agrees with our theoretical predictions .",
    "the size of the gaps between the flow lines gives the amount of harmonic measure carried on fingers of the cluster based between the chosen points on the unit circle .    in the case where @xmath2 is the lune @xmath65 , the map @xmath48 is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 we shall use in section [ model ] the following estimate of the logarithmic capacity of @xmath46 for this case .",
    "as @xmath24 , @xmath68",
    "we introduce a class of random flows on the circle , whose distributions are invariant under rotations of the circle , and , under which , each point on the circle performs a l ' evy process of mean @xmath69 with no diffusive part .",
    "the flow maps are in general not continuous on the circle , but have a non - crossing property . in a certain asymptotic regime ,",
    "the motion of the flow from a countable family of starting points is shown to converge weakly to a family of coalescing brownian motions .    we specify a particular flow by the choice of a non - decreasing , right - continuous function @xmath70 with the following _ degree _",
    "@xmath1 property to itself having an order - preserving property . in practice",

    "when @xmath71 is continuous , we shall also write @xmath81 and , generally , we write @xmath82 in place of @xmath83 in expressions where the choice of left or right - continuous modification makes no difference to the value . for @xmath76 and @xmath84 , define @xmath85 by @xmath86 the degree @xmath1 property ensures that there is no dependence on the choice of representative @xmath87 .",
