    "we discuss the problem of detecting whether or not , in a given network , there is a cluster of nodes which exhibit an `` unusual behavior .",
    "'' suppose that we are given a set of nodes with a random variable attached to each node .",
    "we observe a realization of this process and would like to tell whether all the variables at the nodes have the same behavior , in the sense that they are all sampled from a common distribution , or whether there is a cluster of nodes at which the variables have a different distribution .",
    "the task of detection in networks is critical for an increasing number of applications , for example , in surveillance and environment monitoring .",
    "we describe a few of these applications below .",
    "the advent of sensor networks @xcite has multiplied the amount of data and the variety of applications where the task of detection is central .",
    "surveillance and environment monitoring are prime areas of application for sensor networks .",
    "take , for example , the transport of hazardous materials .",
    "currently , some major traffic bottlenecks ( e.g. , airports , subways and borders ) use portal monitoring systems @xcite . sensor networks offer a more flexible , decentralized alternative and are considered for the detection of radioactive , biological or chemical materials @xcite .",
    "sensor networks are also extensively used in other target tracking settings @xcite .",
    "a digital camera may be seen as a sensor network , with ccd or cmos pixel sensors . as imaging systems have been available for quite some time , the literature on detection in images is quite extensive , spanning several decades , particularly in satellite imagery @xcite , computer vision @xcite and medical imaging @xcite .",
    "the presence of a biological or chemical material in a given geographical region may also be detected indirectly through its impact on human health . in this context ,",
    "early detection of the disease outbreak is crucial in order to minimize the severity of the epidemic . for that purpose ,",
    "some specific information networks are used , with surveillance systems now incorporating data from hospital emergency visits , ambulance dispatch calls and pharmacy sales of over - the - counter drugs @xcite .",
    "diseases affect computers as well , in the form of viruses and worms spreading from host to host in a computer network  @xcite .",
    "affected machines may exhibit slightly anomalous behavior ( e.g. , a  loss of performance or violations of specific rules ) which may be hard to detect on an individual machine .      in @xcite , the water quality in a network of streams in pennsylvania",
    "is assessed by field biologists performing a variety of analyses at various locations along the streams ; the objective is to determine whether there are regions of low biological integrity based on the collected data , and to identify these regions .",
    "other field measurements include census data and surveys involving geographical location .",
    "detection is , of course , closely related to estimation ( i.e. , the localization or extraction of the anomalous cluster of nodes ) , but different .",
    "this distinction is rarely made clear , however .",
    "indeed , reliable detection is possible at lower signal - to - noise ratios than reliable estimation and it may be important to detect the presence of signals from noisy data without being able to estimate them .",
    "for example , one could imagine developing a surveillance system performing detection at relatively low energy / bandwidth costs , yet efficient at low signal - to - noise ratios , and then switching to estimation mode whenever the presence of a signal is detected .",
    "another example would be a low cost preliminary survey involving fewer field measurements , with findings subsequently confirmed by a larger , more expensive survey .",
    "we loosely model a network with a set of @xmath0 nodes , denoted by @xmath1 . in our examples",
    ", we will either assume that @xmath1 is embedded in a euclidean space or we will equip @xmath1 with a graph structure .",
    "our analysis is in the setting of large networks , that is , @xmath2 . to each node @xmath3",
    ", we attach a random variable @xmath4 .",
    "the nodes represent the sources of information ( e.g. , sensors ) and the variables represent the data they collect . in some settings ,",
    "the data collected by each unit is multidimensional , in which case @xmath4 is a random vector .",
    "our discussion readily generalizes to that setting .",
    "the random variables are assumed to be independent . for concreteness , we consider a normal location model , popular in signal and image processing , to model the noise .",
    "our analysis , however , generalizes to any exponential family under some conditions on the sizes of the anomalous clusters , such as bernoulli models which arise in sensor arrays where each sensor collects one bit ( i.e. , makes a binary decision ) or poisson models which come up with count data , for instance , arising in infectious disease surveillance systems @xcite .",
    "the extension to exponential families is detailed in section [ sec : expo ] .",
    "the situation where no signal is present , that is , `` business as usual , '' is modeled as @xmath5 let @xmath6 be a cluster , which we define for now as a subset of nodes , that is , .",
    "in fact , we will be interested in classes of clusters that are either derived from a geometric shape , when @xmath1 is embedded in euclidean space , or connected components , when @xmath1 has a graph structure .",
    "the situation where the nodes in @xmath6 behave anomalously is modeled as @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "we choose to decompose @xmath9 as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the number of nodes in @xmath6 and @xmath12 is the signal strength .",
    "indeed , with this normalization , for any cluster @xmath6 , @xmath13 where the minimum is over all tests for @xmath14 versus @xmath15 and the lower bound is achieved by the likelihood ratio ( neyman  pearson ) test .",
    "we define @xmath16 figures [ fig : thick][fig : animal ] illustrate the setting for various types of clusters .",
    "let @xmath17 be a class of clusters within @xmath1 and define @xmath18 we are interested in testing @xmath14 versus @xmath19 .",
    "in other words , under the alternative , the cluster of anomalous nodes is only known to belong to @xmath17 .",
    "we adopt a minimax point of view . for a test @xmath20",
    ", we define its worst - case risk as @xmath21 the minimax risk for @xmath14 versus @xmath19 is defined as @xmath22 we say that @xmath14 and @xmath19 are asymptotically inseparable ( in the minimax sense ) if @xmath23 which is equivalent to saying that , as @xmath0 becomes large , no test can perform substantially better than random guessing , without even looking at the data .",
    "a sequence of tests @xmath24 is said to asymptotically separate @xmath14 and @xmath19 if @xmath25 and @xmath14 and @xmath19 are said to be asymptotically separable if there is such a sequence of tests .",
    "for example , in view of ( [ eq : simple - risk ] ) , for any sequence of clusters @xmath26 , @xmath14 and @xmath27 are asymptotically inseparable if @xmath28 and they are asymptotically separable if @xmath29 . for convenience , we assume that no cluster in the class @xmath17 is of size comparable to that of the entire network , that is , @xmath30 .",
    "this simplifies the statement of our results and detecting such clusters can easily be achieved using the test that rejects for large values of @xmath31 .",
    "the situation we just described is purely spatial and relevant in some applications not involving time .",
    "such situations are common in image processing .",
    "in other applications , especially in surveillance , time is an intrinsic part of the setting . in the following section ,",
    "we modify the model above to incorporate time .",
    "building on the framework introduced in the previous section , we assume that each @xmath4 is now a ( discrete ) time series , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is finite with @xmath34 ; let @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 be a class of cluster sequences of the form @xmath37 such that @xmath38 for all @xmath39 .",
    "for example , assuming that @xmath1 is embedded in a euclidean space , with norm denoted by @xmath40 , a space  time cylinder ( e.g. , one used in disease outbreak detection @xcite ) is a cluster sequence @xmath41 of the form @xmath42 if @xmath43 , and @xmath44 otherwise , so that @xmath45 is the origin of the cluster in time and @xmath46 its center .",
    "note that the radius remains constant here .",
    "another example is that of a space  time cone , of the form @xmath47 if @xmath48 and @xmath44 otherwise , so that @xmath49 is the origin of the cluster in space  time .",
    "the random variables @xmath50 are assumed to be independent .",
    "this spatio - temporal setting is a special case of the purely spatial setting with the set of nodes @xmath51",
    ". understood as such , we are interested in testing @xmath14 versus @xmath19 as before .      although the detection problem formulated above seems of great practical relevance , the statistics literature is almost silent on the subject , with the notable exception of the closely related topics of change - point analysis @xcite and sequential analysis @xcite .",
    "indeed , the former is a special case of the spatial setting with the one - dimensional lattice , while the latter is a special case of the spatio - temporal setting where @xmath1 has only one node . in our context , these two settings are actually equivalent .",
    "what is further puzzling is that a number of publications addressing the task of detection in sensor networks all assume overly simplistic models .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the values at the sensors are assumed to all have the same distribution under the null and the alternative .",
    "that is , either all of the nodes are all right or they are all anomalous  in our notation , @xmath52 .",
    "first , this is not a subtle statistical problem since , in such circumstances , it suffices to apply the optimal likelihood ratio test .",
    "second , this assumption does not make sense in all of the applications described above , where the event to be detected is expected to only affect a small fraction of locations in the network .    in stark contrast , in all of the applications described earlier , the set of alternatives is composite .",
    "viewing each node as performing a test of hypotheses , which is common in the literature on sensor networks , our problem falls within the framework of multiple comparisons .",
    "multiple hypothesis testing is a rich and active line of research which is receiving a considerable amount of attention within the statistical community at the moment ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the vast majority of the papers assume that the tests are independent of each other , which is clearly not the case here since , in general , the class contains clusters that intersect .",
    "this is particularly true in engineering applications , although this assumption is often made @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the test that rejects for large values of the following version of the scan statistic : @xmath53 the chosen normalization is such that each term in the maximization is standard normal under the null and allows us to compare clusters of different sizes .",
    "it corresponds to the generalized likelihood ratio test in our context if @xmath12 is independent of @xmath54 .",
    "the scan statistic was originally proposed in the context of cluster detection in point clouds @xcite .",
    "this is the method of matched filters which is ubiquitous in problems of detection in a wide variety of fields , sometimes in the form of deformable templates in the engineering literature @xcite or their nonparametric equivalent , active contours or snakes @xcite .",
    "note that the scan statistic is the prevalent method in disease outbreak detection , with many variations @xcite .",
    "as advocated in @xcite , we will not use the scan statistic directly in most cases , but rather restrict the scanning to a subset of @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , we will introduce , on subsets of nodes @xmath55 , the metric @xmath56-net of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath57 , that is , a subset @xmath58 with the property that for each @xmath54 , there is a @xmath59 such that @xmath60 .",
    "we will elaborate on this approach in the [ supp ] .",
    "when @xmath61 is minimal , we call the resulting statistic an @xmath62-scan statistic . the approximation precision @xmath62 will be chosen appropriately , depending on the situation .",
    "we focus on @xmath62-scan statistics for two reasons .",
    "first , their performance is easier to analyze than that of the scan statistic itself ; in fact , the main approach to analyzing the scan statistic , the chaining method of dudley @xcite , is via a properly chosen @xmath62-scan statistic .",
    "second , some of the classes we consider are rather large and we believe that it would be computationally impractical to scan through all of the clusters in the class ; furthermore , our results show that , from an asymptotic standpoint , no substantial improvement would be gained by using the full scan statistic .",
    "we also note that the tuning parameter @xmath62 may be dispensed with if we scan over subsets of different sizes in a multiscale fashion and use a scale - dependent threshold .",
    "the vast majority of the literature assumes that the set of nodes is embedded in some euclidean space , that is , @xmath63 .",
    "this is the case when the nodes represent spatial locations , such as in most sensor networks . in this context , the cluster class @xmath17 is often derived from a class of domains @xmath64 in @xmath65 , in the following way : @xmath66 most of the literature assumes that the class @xmath64 is parametric , exemplified by deformable templates , for which theoretical results are available , especially in the case of the square lattice @xcite . in particular , with a normal location model , the scan statistic performs well , in the sense that it is asymptotically minimax ; this is shown in @xcite in a slightly different context tailored to image processing applications .",
    "we also mention the recent work @xcite , which considers the detection of multiple clusters ( intervals ) of various amplitudes in the one - dimensional lattice . as for nonparametric classes of domains",
    ", @xcite argues that the scan statistic is asymptotically minimax for the case of star - shaped clusters with smooth boundaries .",
    "when @xmath1 is endowed with a graph structure , @xcite considers paths of a certain length . in this setting ,",
    "the scan statistic is shown to be asymptotically minimax when the graph @xmath1 is a complete , regular tree and near - minimax for many other types of graphs , such as the @xmath67-dimensional lattice for @xmath68 .",
    "addario - berry et al .",
    "@xcite considers the same general testing problem with a focus on cluster classes defined within the complete graph , such as cliques and spanning trees .",
    "note that part of the material presented here appeared in @xcite .",
    "we describe here in an informal way the results we obtain .    in section [ sec : geometric ] , we focus on situations where the vertex set @xmath1",
    "is embedded in a euclidean space and well spread out in a compact domain . within this framework ,",
    "we consider in section [ sec : thick ] a geometric class of clusters obtained as in ( [ eq : cluster - class ] ) with @xmath64 a class of blobs that are mild deformations of the unit ball .",
    "the clusters obtained in this way are `` thick , '' in the sense that they are not filamentary .",
    "see figure [ fig : thick ] .",
    "in particular , this class contains all the common parametric classes obtained from parametric shapes such as hyperrectangles and ellipsoids , as long as the shape is not too narrow .",
    "note that the size , the ( exact ) shape and the spatial location of the anomalous cluster under the alternative is unknown . in corollary",
    "[ cor : allk ] , we show that ( under specific conditions ) @xmath14 and @xmath19 are asymptotically inseparable if there is @xmath69 slowly enough such that , for all @xmath54 , @xmath70 and conversely , we show that a version of the scan statistic asymptotically separates @xmath14 and @xmath19 if there is @xmath71 slowly enough such that , for all @xmath54 , @xmath72 note that the detection rate is the same as for the class of balls so that , perhaps surprisingly , scanning for the location ( and not the shape ) is what drives the minimax detection risk .    in section [ sec : thin ] , we consider `` thin '' clusters , obtained as in ( [ eq : cluster - class ] ) with @xmath64 a class of `` bands '' around smooth curves , surfaces or higher - dimensional submanifolds",
    ". in particular , this class contains hyperrectangles and ellipsoids that are sufficiently thin ; see figure [ fig : thin ] .",
    "it turns out that , contrary to what happens for thick clusters , scanning for the actual shape impacts the minimax detection risk and is , in fact , the main contributor for some nonparametric classes .",

    "<S> we consider the problem of detecting whether or not , in a given sensor network , there is a cluster of sensors which exhibit an `` unusual behavior . '' </S>",

    "<S> we also address surveillance settings where each sensor in the network collects information over time . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting model is similar , now with a time series attached to each node . </S>",

    "<S> the growth models used to represent the emerging cluster are quite general and , in particular , include cellular automata used in modeling epidemics . in both settings , we consider classes of clusters that are quite general , for which we obtain a lower bound on their respective minimax detection rate and show that some form of scan statistic , by far the most popular method in practice , achieves that same rate to within a logarithmic factor . </S>",
