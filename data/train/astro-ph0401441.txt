    "morphological classification has remained an active and fundamental area of extragalactic astronomy .",
    "traditional classification based on the hubble sequence @xcite has played an important role in the development of the morphological study of galaxies . as data sets",
    "grow larger and more precise , the hubble scheme is becoming increasingly inadequate as a framework in which to do morphological classification ( e.g , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hubble based his system on the @xmath7-band morphologies of galaxies , and classification has almost exclusively relied on @xmath7-band data .",
    "early multi - wavelength studies of galaxies include the discovery of `` red arms '' by @xcite and a comparison of the disk and arm structure of six spirals by @xcite . in recent years , numerous studies",
    "have been done comparing the optical and near - infrared ( near - ir ) morphologies of galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that the optical morphology of ngc309 is that of a multi - arm spiral , whereas its 2.1 micron morphology is that of a two - arm spiral with a prominent central bar .",
    "@xcite searched optical and near - ir images of a sample of isolated and group early - type galaxies for shells and other morphological features that provide clues to galaxy evolution . @xcite",
    "have shown that , on average , galaxies with @xmath7-band classifications sa through scd appear about one `` t - type '' @xcite earlier in the @xmath8-band , albeit with large scatter .",
    "@xcite finds that galaxies appear smaller in the near - infrared as compared to the optical , and have higher @xmath9-band surface brightness than @xmath7-band .",
    "in particular , @xcite concludes that early types appear redder than late types when comparing the @xmath9- and @xmath7-band surface brightness .",
    "because observations in different bands probe different stellar populations , there is significant motivation for developing a multi - wavelength morphological classification system .",
    "it is well known that for the case of spiral galaxies , the shorter wavelength ( e.g. , the @xmath7-band ) morphology is dominated by knotty regions of young stars and star - forming regions , while the longer wavelength morphology is dominated by older stars with a smoother spatial distribution .",
    "for example , @xcite find that late type galaxies are more asymmetric in the @xmath7-band than in the @xmath8-band , representing the prevalence of the patchy , irregular star forming regions at shorter wavelengths .",
    "in addition , they find that galaxies are more concentrated in the ir than in the optical ; however , this may be either the result of a difference in optical depth between the two bands near the center of galaxies , or because there is a strong color gradient .",
    "morphological classification based on images in just one observing band is unable to take advantage of variations in the stellar population of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , differences in absorption between observing bands can result in structures being obscured by dust , sometimes leading to noticeably different morphologies @xcite .",
    "the inherent subjectivity in the hubble framework has motivated the development of new and quantitative morphological classification schemes .",
    "the most common of these is based on a central concentration and asymmetry measurement @xcite .",
    "recent work has investigated utilizing the gini coefficient for quantifying morphology @xcite . with the advent of large astronomical databases , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , *",
    "* ) , manual classification is becoming extraordinarily impractical .",
    "neural networks have proven to be effective at replicating the hubble classifications of human classifiers @xcite , although in and of themselves they are unable to create a new and quantitative morphological classification framework .",
    "in addition , because of their ` black box ' nature the results of neural networks are difficult to interpret .",
    "furthermore , many of the proposed classification schemes have only been applied to data from one observing band .",
    "a multi - wavelength quantitative classification of spiral bars was developed by @xcite , and both @xcite and @xcite have investigated the dependence of central concentration and asymmetry measurements with wavelength .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite have described the dependence of their methods on observing band .",
    "a near - ir ( @xmath10 m ) classification scheme was developed by @xcite based on the pitch angle and fourier modes of a spiral galaxy .",
    "their classification scheme was developed for the purpose of developing a dust - penetrating morphological classification system with emphasis on the the population ii stars , and they did not find any relationship between their near - ir classes and the optical hubble classes . while useful , non - optical classification frameworks are still based on one observing band and are incomplete in the sense that it facilitates different classifications for different parts of the spectrum ; i.e. , independent classification schemes are developed for the optical and near - ir morphologies .    in our previous paper (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we set forth a new classification scheme based on the shapelet @xcite decomposition of the @xmath11-band images of a volume - limited sample of @xmath12 sdss galaxies .",
    "we applied a karhunen - loeve ( kl ) transform ( or principal component analysis , pca ) to the shapelet coefficients and used a mixture of gaussians model to estimate the density of the galaxies in the space spanned by the first nine kl modes .",
    "the mixture model was used as a classification framework , where each gaussian is identified with a morphological class .",
    "developing a morphological classification system in this manner has the advantage of being model - independent , quantitative , and automatic .",
    "motivated by the results of our previous analysis , and by the advantages of a multi - wavelength classification scheme , we have performed a similar analysis of sdss galaxies using the images from all five bands : @xmath13 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , because we used circular shapelets in the decompositions of paper i , the axis ratio information was found to contaminate most , if not all , of the principal components .",
    "this is obviously undesirable , as axis ratio is most strongly a result of a galaxy s orientation along our line of sight , and not of its intrinsic morphology .",
    "to remedy this , we perform our analysis in this paper with elliptical shapelets , removing to first order the effect of inclination on morphology .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in   [ shapelets ] we give a brief description of the shapelet basis . in   [ data ]",
    "we describe our samples and in ",
    "[ decomp ] we describe our shapelet decomposition method . in   [ pca ]",
    "we describe principal component analysis , as well as show and describe the first ten spectro - morphological principal components . in   [ the_method ] we describe using mixture models for classification , describe each of the three mixture classes , and compare the results with @xmath4 classification . in   [ conclusions ] we conclude with a summary of our results and a discussion describing the limitations of our technique and ways in which it can be improved upon .",
    "most of the shapelet formalism can be found in @xcite , and paper i describes the necessary information for our work . for completeness , we summarize a few of the important points .",
    "shapelets form a complete orthonormal set , and happen to be the eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator hamiltonian .",
    "the 1-dimensional basis functions are @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a characteristic scale , @xmath16 is a non - negative integer denoting the order , and the dimensionless basis functions @xmath17 are @xmath18^{1/2 } h_n ( x ) e^{-x^2 /2}. \\label{eq02}\\ ] ] here , @xmath19 is a hermite polynomial of order @xmath16 .",
    "shapelets are orthonormal over @xmath20 .",
    "the 2-dimensional shapelets are easily constructed from the 1-dimensional : @xmath21 any sufficiently well behaved function ( e.g. , a galaxy image ) can be decomposed into a sum of shapelets as @xmath22 with shapelet coefficients found from the orthonormality property : @xmath23 here , we have used the notation @xmath24 and @xmath25 in addition , we will also use dirac notation to denote the shapelet states , where the @xmath26 state is denoted as @xmath27 and has x - space representation @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ shapelets_fig ] shows the first several elliptical shapelets .",
    "the sdss @xcite is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of the northern galactic cap over @xmath29 steradians .",
    "a 2.5 m telescope at the apache point observatory , sunspot , new mexico , observes the sky in five bands ( _ u , g , r , i , z _ , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) between 3000 and 10000  , using a drift - scanning mosaic ccd camera @xcite , which detects objects to a flux limit of @xmath30 mags .",
    "the survey , when finished , is expected to spectroscopically observe 900,000 galaxies down to @xmath31 mags @xcite , 100,000 luminous red galaxies @xcite , and 100,000 quasars @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic follow - up uses two digital spectrographs on the same telescope as the imaging camera , and the spectroscopic samples are assigned plates and fibers using an algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "the astrometric calibration is described in @xcite .",
    "details of the galaxy survey can be found in the galaxy target selection paper @xcite , and other principles of the survey are described in the early data release ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edr , ) .",
    "details of the first data relase ( dr1 ) can be found in @xcite    as in paper i , we use two samples in this analysis .",
    "we first investigate the shapelet method using the @xmath13 and @xmath1-band data for 184 of the 1482 well - resolved galaxies used by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sample 1 ) to estimate the morphology - dependent luminosity function .",
    "we have chosen this group in order to compare the shapelet results with traditional hubble type , as this catalog contains manual classifications of hubble type .",
    "the manual classifications make no distinction between spirals with bar structure and spirals without .",
    "sample 1 contains those galaxies of the @xcite sample that have redshifts @xmath32 and a psf @xmath33 of less than 2.0 kpc when projected onto the plane of the galaxy in all five bands .",
    "this allows us to smooth all galaxies of sample 1 to a constant scale before decomposing them ( see   [ decomp ] ) .",
    "these galaxies are included in the sdss edr .",
    "we next investigate the shapelet method on the images from all five bands of a volume - limited sample of 1519 nearby galaxies ( hereafter sample 2 ) included in the sdss dr1 .",
    "these galaxies were chosen because they have projected psf widths of less than our desired resolution of 2.0 kpc , allowing us to smooth them to this scale in all five bands .",
    "they have redshifts @xmath34 and absolute magnitudes @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we made the redshift cut at @xmath37 because projected psf widths become larger than 2.0 kpc for redshifts greater than this , and we chose galaxies of these absolute magnitudes to allow a uniform distribution of absolute magnitude with redshift .",
    "although we started with the same galaxies as in paper i , we were left with only @xmath38 galaxies after making these same cuts on all five bands , as opposed to @xmath12 after making the cuts on only the @xmath11-band data . in addition , we omitted galaxies for which information necessary to compute the shapelet coefficients ( e.g. , the sdss ellipticity parameters ) was missing or had large errors in their shapelet reconstruction in at least one of the five bands , leaving a total of 1519 galaxies .",
    "figure [ sample ] displays the redshift , @xmath11-band absolute magnitude , and @xmath39 color distributions for this sample .",
    "most of the information regarding our decomposition method can be found in paper i ; here we reiterate the important points as well as the additions and modifications to the method we have introduced .",
    "we calculate the position angle of the galaxy , @xmath40 , from the @xmath11-band sdss ellipticity parameters , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and its axis ratio , @xmath43 , from @xmath41 and @xmath42 in each band .",
    "the ellipticity parameters are calculated from the galaxy s adaptively weighted moments @xcite : @xmath44 we rotate the image for each band by @xmath40 , as well as that of the sdss psf .",
    "this assures that all galaxies are oriented with their @xmath11-band major axis oriented along the horizontal .    in paper i , we used shapelets characterized by a single scale , @xmath15 .",
    "while the use of circular shapelets includes the necessary morphological information for classification , information regarding the galaxy s axis ratio contaminates the principal components and the resulting classification scheme .",
    "to remedy this problem , we use shapelets of varying ellipticity , where the scales along the major and minor axis are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . the axis ratio of the shapelets is then @xmath47 . for each band , the shapelet scales , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are calculated as @xmath48^{1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ \\gamma_2 & = & \\left ( \\frac{b}{a } \\right ) \\gamma_1 , \\label{eq07}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 are the adaptively weighted moments in the horizontal and vertical directions in that band , and @xmath43 is the axis ratio of the galaxy in that band .",
    "we also compute the psf axis ratio and scales , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , from the psf adaptive moments in the same manner as for the galaxy . if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 is set to @xmath54 . if necessary",
    ", we pad the image with blank sky out to a distance @xmath55 from the center , and use the value of @xmath56 for that band to add artificial noise .",
    "this ensures the orthogonality of the shapelets .",
    "we subtract off the sky prior to decomposition .",
    "as outlined in paper i , we desire to have all galaxies resolved on the same physical scale , ensuring that differences in shapelet coefficients are not the result of differences in resolution . to do this",
    ", we artificially redshift the galaxies to @xmath57 , which defines the upper limit of our sample .",
    "artificial redshifting is performed by rebinning the image such that the angular size of the image , and thus the number of pixels it occupies , is reduced to what it would be if the galaxy were observed at @xmath37 . before artificially redshifting the galaxies , we deconvolve them with the sdss psf .",
    "this is accomplished by first calculating the shapelet coefficients for the galaxy , @xmath58 , and the sdss psf , @xmath59 , using the scales given above in each band and decomposing about their respective centers up to a maximum order @xmath60 .",
    "the deconvolved shapelet coefficients , @xmath61 , are then given by @xmath62 here , the sum is over the dummy index @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the inverse of the psf matrix , @xmath65 , which may be calculated from the shapelet convolution tensor and psf shapelet coefficients , @xmath59 as outlined in @xcite .",
    "the dummy induces @xmath66 and @xmath63 are introduced to enable the matrix multiplication by coding the shapelet orders as @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "the deconvolved image is then constructed from the deconvolved shapelet coefficients , @xmath61 , with scale @xmath69 , as used for the original image .",
    "@xcite found that using the same scale for the deconvolved image as for the original image gave the best results .",
    "we then artificially redshift the deconvolved image to @xmath37 .",
    "it should be noted that the deconvolution will appear poor in the pixel - space representation of the galaxy .",
    "this is because we only decompose the galaxy image up to a maximum order of @xmath70 , and thus are obtaining information from the galaxy between scales of @xmath71 and @xmath72 . because we use an undercomplete shapelet basis , information outside of these scales",
    "is only partially contained within the coefficients . to be more precise ,",
    "consider some feature in the galaxy image of size less than @xmath73 .",
    "one is not able to accurately fit this feature because the shapelets are not of high enough order .",
    "while information regarding this feature will exist partially in the shapelet coefficients , when one attempts to reconstruct this feature from these coefficients it will appear broadened .",
    "this is not a problem for our purposes , as we decompose the smoothed , artificially redshifted galaxy using the same @xmath70 , and thus the small - scale features are already broadened .",
    "structures on scales smaller than @xmath74 are unlikely to contribute significantly to spectro - morphological classification as these structures are more likely a product of a galaxy s unique history , rather than the result of physical processes common to all galaxies of a spectro - morphological class . in this analysis",
    "we use @xmath75 , and thus information of structure less then @xmath76 is not completely included in the classification scheme .",
    "this corresponds to the shapelet coefficients containing information between @xmath770.254 kpc for the smallest galaxies in our sample and @xmath77232 kpc for the largest .",
    "we have experimented with using higher values of @xmath70 , but did not see any noticeable differences in our results that justified the significantly higher computational time .    we convolve the redshifted galaxies in each band with a gaussian of standard deviation @xmath78 .",
    "the new shapelet scales , @xmath79 , become @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the shapelet scale after reducing @xmath53 to account for the artificial redshifting .",
    "we use @xmath79 to correct for the loss of resolution resulting from the additional smoothing , ensuring that @xmath82 .",
    "it should be noted that although errors are introduced from the deconvolution , most notably in the higher order coefficients , the additional convolution by a gaussian ` smooths out ' these errors , as the effect of the convolution process is to project the higher order coefficients onto the lower order ones @xcite .",
    "we use a standard physical width in resolution of @xmath83 kpc , corresponding to a gaussian psf @xmath33 of @xmath84 kpc as projected onto the plane of the galaxy .",
    "after the smoothing the image , we calculate the shapelet coefficients by decomposing the galaxy image about its centroid in each band .",
    "we compute the centroid of the image from the shapelet coefficients ( see paper i ) and decompose the galaxy about this new centroid .",
    "the centroid is defined as the first moment of the galaxy .",
    "we iterate this procedure twice .",
    "we then calculate the total number of instrumental counts in the image in each band from the shapelet coefficients , convert this to a flux in jy , and normalize the coefficients so that the flux of the galaxy summed over all bands is 1 jy .",
    "this keeps information regarding the differences in a galaxy s flux between bands and ensures that galaxies of different total optical luminosities do not have different shapelet coefficients ; i.e. , only information regarding a galaxy s morphology and its flux ratios between the bands @xmath13 and @xmath1 are included in the shapelet coefficients , making the resulting classification scheme independent of abolute magnitude .",
    "figure [ decomp_im ] shows a galaxy image at a few stages in the decomposition process .",
    "in order to reduce the dimensionality of our data set , we perform a principal component analysis ( kl - transform ) on the shapelet coefficients for the galaxies of sample 2 .",
    "doing so allows us to reduce the 455-dimensional space spanned by the shapelet coefficients ( 91 coefficients for each band ) to one that is more manageable .",
    "the principal component analysis was performed on the ` sum - of - squares and cross - products ' ( sscp ) of the data matrix ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the data matrix is constructed by concatenating the shapelets coefficients in each band into one matrix that contains the entire multiwavelength shapelet information . in other words ,",
    "the kl - transform was done using the entire multi - band information .",
    "we removed data points outside a distance of @xmath85 from the median for each shapelet coefficient before calculating the sscp matrix , as we assumed that either data points outside of this range were the result of some sort of error in the reduction processes and thus unphysical , or would result in principal components that appear to have large variance due to the presence outlying points .",
    "this resulted in removing @xmath86 of our original sample .",
    "we note that these galaxies were only removed from the principal component calculation ; we still calculated their projections onto the principal component space and used them in the mixture model classification .",
    "a brief look did not reveal any obvious visual differences between these galaxies and those used in calculating the sscp matrix .",
    "we chose to do the pca on the sscp matrix for ease of interpretation .",
    "the sscp matrix is the uncentered covariance matrix , and the sscp results differ only by a constant from that obtained by performing the pca on the covariance matrix .",
    "the kl - modes of the sscp pca are nearly indistinguishable from the covariance pca , however we prefer the sscp kl - modes as it allows us to view the first principal component as a type of ` starting point ' for galaxy morphology , with subsequent modifications from the other eigenmodes resulting in a galaxy s unique morphology . for principal components obtained from the covariance matrix one must add the mean back in to reconstruct a galaxy s morphology , and in this case the first eigenmode can have positive and negative coefficients , whereas the coefficients are always positive for the sscp result .",
    "this is important bacause it is not very helpful to view the first principal component as a starting point if its flux is negative . in summary , we prefer the sscp results because of it s simpler interpretation as the first principal component being the ` basic ' galaxy morphology , as opposed to the first principal component of the covariance matrix being the ` basic ' galaxy morphology after adding the mean back in . also , we do not consider performing the pca on the correlation matrix , as it would require us to standardize the shapelet coefficients , destroying our flux normalization .",
    "similar to the results from paper i , which applied the kl - transform to just the @xmath11-band images , the first few principal components contain the vast majority of the variance .",
    "we denote the @xmath87 principal component as @xmath88 and its corresponding coefficient as @xmath89 .    after applying the kl - transform on the sample 2 data",
    ", we calculate the projections of the galaxies of sample 1 along the principal components .",
    "doing so allows us to develop an idea of the location of the different hubble types in the kl - space .",
    "we divide the sample 1 galaxies into four types : early , middle , late , and edge - on .",
    "the early types include those classified by @xcite as hubble types e  sa , the middle types as sab  sbc , and the late types as sc ",
    "the edge - on class consists of middle and late type galaxies with axis ratios @xmath90 .",
    "figure [ ttype2d ] shows the locations of the galaxies in the 2-dimensional slice spanned by @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and figure [ ttype1d ] shows the marginal probability densities of the first ten @xmath89 for the sample 1 galaxies , divided according to hubble type .",
    "note that in general , the distribution of the edge - on spirals is not significantly different than that of the middle and late - type spirals , justifying our use of elliptical shapelets to remove axis ratio information to first order .",
    "the first , second , and ninth @xmath88 obtain the most significant separation of ellipticals and spirals , and to a lesser extent the third as well .",
    "figure [ klbw ] shows the first ten kl - morphologies , constructed from their shapelet coefficients , as well as an early and late type galaxy , shown as a reference to the relative scale of the @xmath88 .",
    "for a few of the kl - morphologies , the peak does not exactly fall in the center of the image ; this is a result of our decomposition method as we defined the centriod of decomposition to be the first moment of the galaxy and not the location of the flux peak . in table",
    "[ tab01 ] we show the ratios of the total flux for each of the first ten @xmath88 in each band , as well as the ratios of the total ` energy ' in each band .",
    "we define total energy in the usual mathematical way as @xmath93 here , @xmath94 is the @xmath87 principal component , represented in the pixel space of the original galaxy images ( i.e. , the image of the principal component as in figure [ klbw ] ) for the @xmath95 band , and @xmath96 is the set of shapelet coefficients representing @xmath94 .",
    "the total flux ratios show how each @xmath88 contributes to the overall sed of the galaxy , whereas the energy ratios show for each @xmath88 the relative importance of each band s spectro - morphological contribution .",
    "the flux ratios are normalized such that the sum of their absolute values is unity , and the energy ratios are normalized to sum to unity .",
    "figure [ klgri ] shows false color images of the energy of each of the first ten @xmath88 , constructed from the @xmath97 and @xmath66 band images .",
    "here , as well as in the rest of this work , we use the asinh stretch of @xcite to display red - green - blue ( rgb ) images .",
    "these images are helpful in visualizing the color gradient of each @xmath88 , giving a spatially - dependent description of color .",
    "the first principal component is very similar to @xmath91 found from using just the @xmath11-band images in paper i. in all five bands it has a radial profile that is between an exponential and a gaussian , and its morphology does not change significantly between the different bands .",
    "figure [ sersic ] shows the azimuthally - averaged radial profile for @xmath91 , as well as the best - fit srsic profile , defined as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the characteristic radius and @xmath16 the srsic index .",
    "the first principal component has srsic induces of @xmath100 , with minimal variance across the different bands .",
    "in addition , figure [ sersic ] shows the @xmath39 radial profile for @xmath91 ; there is minimal radial color gradient in @xmath91 until one reaches the edge ..    the vast majority of the variance is contained within @xmath91 , and the magnitudes of its coefficients , @xmath101 , are significantly higher than the other @xmath102 .",
    "this implies that @xmath91 may be interpreted as the basic galaxy morphology , where further and comparitively small modifications introduced from the other @xmath88 serve to form a galaxy s unique shape . in other words",
    ", galaxies appear to be constructed starting with a @xmath91-like component , which is then modified with additional components .",
    "furthermore , @xmath91 does not contain any holes of negative flux , nor are any of the coefficients negative , as would be expected if @xmath91 forms the ` basic ' galaxy morphology .",
    "in general , @xmath91 has astronomical color that is ` redder ' than the average for our sample , with the exception of @xmath103 , which is @xmath104 for @xmath91 and @xmath105 for the sample 2 galaxies .",
    "this kl - morphology has @xmath106 , whereas the sample 2 average is @xmath107 . in addition , as can be seen from figure [ ttype1d ] , the hubble types separate very well along @xmath91 , with the late types having the smallest values of @xmath108 and the early types having the largest .",
    "the scatterplot matrix in figure [ kl_vs_cur ] shows the 2-d distributions as well as the 1-d marginal probability densities of sample 2 for the first three @xmath89 , the @xmath11-band concentration index , and @xmath39 color .",
    "the concentration index is a common morphological measurement which we define the same way as in paper i : @xmath109 here , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the radii where the petrosian ratio , @xmath112 , is equal to 0.1 and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "more concentrated galaxies ( e.g. , early types ) will have higher values of @xmath113 .",
    "the 1-dimensional probability densities are estimated here , as well as elsewhere in this work , via kernel density estimation .",
    "the kernel estimate takes the empirical probability density which places mass @xmath114 at each data point , @xmath115 , for @xmath116 data points , and convolves them with a kernel , @xmath117 , of bandwidth @xmath118 : @xmath119 the kernel is also a probability density and is constrained to integrate to one .",
    "it is well known that the choice of kernel is not important , and in this work we use the standard normal density . however ,",
    "the choice of bandwidth , @xmath118 , _ is _ important and there has been a significant amount of work toward finding the optimal bandwidth . in this work",
    "we use the sheather and jones plug - in bandwidth @xcite .",
    "the kernel estimate provides an accurate and smooth estimate of the probabilty density of a variable , and is superior to standard histogram estimates .",
    "it is possible to deal with measurement errors in the kernel density estimate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this involves deconvolving the observed probability density with the probability density of the errors .",
    "we did not do this , as this typically only makes a significant difference when the average variance from the measurement errors is some non - negligable fraction of the sample variance .",
    "furthermore , it is unlikely that accounting for the measurement errors would significantly effect our discussion in ",
    "[ mix ] , and we choose to take the simpler path of neglecting the measurement errors because a robust investigation of the probability densities of the various physical parameters is not our goal .    in order to faciliate the subsequent discussion of the principal components , we show in figure [ klmod ] the results when each principal component is added to or subtracted from the first one .",
    "the second principal component has almost half of its energy in the @xmath120-band , implying that the most important spectro - morphological contribution from @xmath92 is in the @xmath120-band .",
    "this eigenmorphology is ` red ' in the sense that the flux is negative for the @xmath121 and @xmath120 bands and positive for the redder bands , and it adds or subtracts a red core and blue halo . it should be noted that the rgb images seen in figure [ klgri ] are of the _ energy _ of the principal components , and are thus necessarily positive .",
    "for example , while @xmath92 may appear to have a blue core in this image , this is merely a reflection of the fact that the absolute value of the bluer core flux is higher than that of the redder core flux ; however , inspection of the images in figure [ klbw ] shows that the core flux becomes _ negative _ as ones moves to the blue .",
    "therefore , adding this spectro - morphology results in decreasing the blue core flux and increasing the red core flux , creating a red core .",
    "the second principal component has the largest ratio of @xmath121-band energy to @xmath11-band energy , signifying that @xmath92 gives the largest contribution to the @xmath39 color gradient of a galaxy .",

    "for example , the edge - on spiral of @xmath170 , is very red and has a value of @xmath39 that would be expected for ellipticals , however the mixture classification is able to effectively place this galaxy into its appropriate spectro - morphological class by incorporating the morphological information .",
    "furthermore , the unusually blue galaxy of @xmath164 has an obvious early type morphology , but one can see from the rgb image that this galaxy is bluer than is typical for this class .",

    "one can see from these figures that if the goal is to separate early and late type galaxies , then the @xmath181 decision boundary is effective but not optimal .",
    "in fact , a considerable number of late type galaxies are misclassified using the @xmath4 decision boundary , and the probability densities for the @xmath155 shown in figure [ ur_vs_mix ] seem to suggest an optimal decision boundary at @xmath6 .",
    "traditionally , late type morphologies are associated with the blue class and early with the red , and the blue and red distributions are both assumed to be gaussian @xcite . however , the results here suggest that the @xmath4 probability densities of late and early type morphologies are only approximately normal and exhibit tails that extend past the @xmath5 decision boundary .",
    "if we equate @xmath170 with late type galaxies , class @xmath164 with early type galaxies , and ignore @xmath163 galaxies , then the @xmath5 decision boundary only classifies @xmath182 of late type galaxies correctly and @xmath183 of early type galaxies correctly , with an average correct classification rate of @xmath184 .",

    "we do not think that the bias and variance of the kernel estimate will significantly alter this result .",
    "the bias is defined as the difference between the expectation value of an estimate and the true value .",
    "the bias in the kernel density estimate is proportional to the square of the bandwidth multplied by the second derivative of the true density . because of this",
    ", the bias will be large in regions of high curvature .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath4 density estimates for @xmath170 and @xmath164 are approximately equal to the true densities , then the bias will be too small to significantly alter the location of the @xmath6 decision boundary suggested by the kernel estimates , as the probability densities are almost linear near @xmath6 and thus will have nearly zero curvature .",
    "therefore , most of the contribution to the uncertainty will come from the variance and a pointwise 95% confidence interval may be estimated from this variance .",
    "although we do not show it in figure [ ur_vs_mix ] , a decision boundary between @xmath190 is consistent with the 95% pointwise confidence interval of the density estimate .",
    "the standard @xmath5 decision boundary is outside of this interval .",
    "these results are intriguing , and a more in - depth analysis of the @xmath4 probability densities would make a correction to these estimates that accounts for the measurement error in @xmath4 , the dependence on luminosity , and sample selection . however , further analysis of using @xmath4 as a proxy for morphological type is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "class @xmath163 is completely hidden in @xmath4 , and extracting the rare @xmath163 galaxies within the redshift and luminosity range of our sample is impossible with a @xmath4 decision boundary .",
    "this is because the @xmath4 probability density of @xmath163 is always lower than that of the other two classes .",

    "we apply the method to a sample of 1519 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey , using the images in all five observing bands ( @xmath13and @xmath1 ) , and show that galaxies of known broad hubble type separate cleanly in shapelet space .",
    "in addition , using the vast amount of sdss data allows the admission of powerful statistical methods of analysis , such as principal component analysis and the mixture of gaussians model . applying the principal component analysis",
    ", we give a description of each principal component s contribution to spectral morphology _ independent _ of the other principal components . using shapelets of ellipticity equal to that of the decomposed galaxy resulted in minimal contamination of axis ratio information in the principal components .",
    "we show that each principal component contains unique morphological information that often varies with observing band , and that the kl - space sufficiently separates galaxies that are known to have different morphologies .",
    "furthermore , we apply a mixture of gaussians model to describe the density of galaxies in the space spanned by the principal components , with each gaussian representing a spectro - morphological class .",
    "the mixture model fit the density to three gaussians , implying three classes .",
    "the two dominant classes were shown to be associated with early and late type galaxies , whereas the other class was populated by galaxies that could often not be associated with any particular hubble type .",
    "the rare first class was shown to consist of galaxies with extended , blue bulges , and were more typically asymmetric .",
    "in addition , we show that galaxies of different morphologies differ , on average , in their physical properties .",
    "we compared our method with a simple cut on color and show that our method is superior for separating galaxies of different spectro - morphological properties , and suggest using a @xmath6 decision boundary instead of the usual @xmath181 .",

    "this was motivated in paper i by the central limit theorem : galaxies of the same spectro - morphological class have experienced similar physical events that produce a mean spectral morphology , but are also subject to smaller - scale physical processes unique to each galaxy that have the effect of producing numerous independent random perturbations to spectral morphology .",
    "therefore , by the central limit theorem , we would expect the probability densities of each @xmath155 to be approximately gaussian .",
    "however , it is likely that this is not the case for every galaxy in each @xmath155 , which will cause the spectro - morphological probability densities to diverge from normality and have more pronounced tails .",
    "for example , it may be that @xmath163 is not a distinct class at all , but that galaxies in @xmath163 are really the result of an extended tail in the @xmath170 probability density . within this interpretation",
    ", the mixture model fit requires an extra gaussian to pick up the @xmath170 tail .",
    "an extended tail may also be the reason for the ` blue ellipticals ' of @xmath164 discussed in   [ mix ] .",
    "on the other hand , these ` blue ellipticals ' may also be a distinct class , but we do not have enough data to produce a 4-gaussian fit to the density with better @xmath142 score than the current 3-gaussian fit . although it is possible that the classes exhibit significant tails in their probability densities , we believe that in general the central limit theorem justifies the use of a mixture of gaussians model here , and that modeling the class densities as such introduces only a small bias in the fit .",
    "one could also introduce a uniform background density , as described in @xcite .",
    "the second and more significant limitation of our method lies in using the principal components as a basis for our classification scheme .",
    "we chose to utilize the shapelet basis as a spectro - morphological basis because it provides a simple but effective means of extracting morphological information with minimal contamination from varying galaxy size and axis ratio .",
    "in addition , we performed classification in the principal component basis primarily because of its dimension - reducing properties , as the kl eigenmodes provide the best lower dimensional linear approximation to a dataset and have maximal variance subject to being orthogonal . however",
    ", this does not mean that the kl - space will be the optimal space for classification . to be more precise",
    ", we have assumed that the galaxy spectro - morphological probability density is a mixture of normal densities , at least in the original pixel space of the galaxy image .",
    "if this is the case , then all linear transformations of the galaxy image will preserve the normality of the respective class probability densities , i.e. , a linear transform of a normally - distributed variable is still a normally - distributed variable . the shapelet transform and kl transform are both linear transforms , and that we expect the _ total _ probability density to be ( approximately ) a multimodal normal distribution follows . by employing the kl",
    "transform as a basis for classification , we have searched for the best lower - dimensional linear approximation to galaxy spectral morphology and classified in this space .",
    "however , this is no reason to believe that the kl - space will achieve an optimal separation between the respective classes .",
    "a better strategy is to look for linear transforms that find spectral morphologies with multimodal probability distributions , and this can be accomplished with projection pursuit @xcite . in particular",
    ", one could search for a linear transform that maximizes the amount of statistical independence among the basis vectors .",
    "this technique is called independent component analysis ( ica , * ? ? ?",
    "whereas pca seeks to find the orthogonal basis that maximizes the variance along its components , ica seeks to find a basis that maximizes statistical independence among it components .",
    "this is equivalent to looking for non - gaussian projections of the data along the basis vectors .",
    "because multimodal probability densities are strongly non - gaussian , the ica form of projection pursuit would be particularly interesting as a basis for spectro - morphological classification .",
    "in addition , because the ica basis vectors are statistically independent , or at least are as statistically independent as possible , the joint probability distribution can be separated into the individual marginal probability distributions of the basis vectors .",
    "this fundamental property facilitates a method of interpreting the individual spectral morphologies , similar to that performed in   [ descript ] .",
    "the principal components , on the other hand , are only uncorrelated , and thus are only statistically independent in the case of unimodal gaussian data .    using the principal components as a basis for classification has its advantages , namely in the area of giving an economical representation of a galaxy s spectral morphology .",
    "the kl - modes have been useful for getting a ` feel ' for the problems investigated here , but there are certainly more effective bases for doing spectro - morphological classification .",
    "we believe that the classification method described here shows considerable promise , and further improvement can be made by choosing a more appropriate basis for spectral - morphological classification .",
