    "the existence of the ionized fraction of the interstellar medium ( ism ) affects the incoming pulsar radiation in several ways .",
    "the first order effect - the interstellar dispersion - is due to the amount of the free electrons along the line - of - sight , usually quantized by the dispersion measure : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the pulsar distance and @xmath4 is the electron density .",
    "this phenomenon causes the pulses to arrive at the observer with the greater delay , the lower the observing frequency is .",
    "this can also cause the so called `` dispersion smearing '' when using filterbank - type spectrometer receivers as there will be a non - zero delay between the pulse arrival at the upper and the lower end of the observing bandwidth ( even for an individual spectral channel of the receiver used ) .",
    "the study of this phenomenon for the entire pulsar population , along with other types of observations ( in both in radio and optical regimes ) , helped us to understand the distribution of free electrons in the milky way galaxy @xcite .",
    "apparently , the ionized medium in our galaxy consists of three main parts : giant h  ii regions within the spiral arms , the thin and dense inner disk , and a diffuse outer disk .    due to the turbulent nature of the interstellar medium and variations of the electron density along the line - of - sight , several other phenomena may also arise when observing pulsars .",
    "one of them is angular and temporal broadening , which are caused by the scattering of the radiation , so it reaches the observer after traveling along different geometrical paths .",
    "the other is the interstellar scintillation ( iss ) , which can be explained in terms of diffraction and refraction effects , and the interference of the pulsar radiation wavefront - disturbed by the existence of non - uniform medium - with itself .",
    "the statistical analysis of the iss helped us to understand the nature of the fluctuations present in the ism ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .    in this paper we will focus on the scattering effects .",
    "even if one assumes that the signal ( a pulse ) leaves the pulsar at one instant , then due to the scattering by the ism it will reach the observer along different geometrical paths , with different lengths , the pulse will arrive at the observer over a finite interval , i.e. the pulse will be smeared and will attain a `` scattering tail '' .",
    "the shape of the tail may be explained if the brightness distribution of the scattered radiation has a two - dimensional gaussian form and the scattering happens only within a thin screen . doing so one can estimate that the pulse broadening function ( @xmath5 ) will take a form of an exponential decay : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is called the scatter time ( or pulse broadening time , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this value will be strongly dependant of the observing frequency : @xmath8 , where the spectral index @xmath9 is the same as for the value of the decorrelation bandwidth @xmath10 , which can be measured by the means of interstellar scintillation observations .",
    "both these values are related as in :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is assumed to be of the order of unity , although it may vary for different ism geometries and/or models of the ism fluctuations @xcite . to estimate the strength of scattering effects one has to assume a reasonable spectrum of electron density fluctuations .",
    "the most common way ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is to assume a homogeneous isotropic turbulence that within a range of fluctuation scales between an _ inner scale _ @xmath13 and the _ outer scale _ @xmath14 has a power spectrum can be expressed as :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is an amplitude of a three - dimensional wavenumber and @xmath17 is the fluctuation strength for a given line - of - sight .    if the fluctuations causing the observed refractive / diffractive effects are indeed within that range ( i.e. @xmath18 ) this equation simplifies into a simple power - law :    @xmath19    and if @xmath20 is lower than 4 one can derive that the scatter time spectral index @xmath21 . for a purely kolmogorov spectrum of the density irregularities ( one has to note that it was devised for a neutral gas ) the spectral index @xmath22 which yields the expected value of @xmath23 .",
    "it has to be mentioned however , that this simplification of equation  [ elec_dens_full ] to eq .",
    "[ elec_dens_simple ] may not be valid for the real case scenarios , i.e. the inner / outer scale condition ( @xmath18 ) will not be fulfilled .",
    "the outer scale is less of a problem , since its influence would make the spectra steeper than kolmogorov , but as @xcite pointed out , the hypothesis of a steeper spectrum was proposed , tested and found to be incorrect .",
    "thus the spectral exponent must be of 4.4 or flatter . from that one",
    "can infer that the outer scale is indeed not a factor in scattering , and one can safely assume that @xmath24 , simplifying eq .",
    "[ elec_dens_full ] .    on the other hand",
    "the inner scale influence is important , and the evidence for that can be found in the pulse shape measurements at meter wavelengths . in general that means , that it does not make sense to analyze observations of high @xmath1 pulsars at low frequencies in terms of eq .",
    "[ elec_dens_simple ] .",
    "when the ( frequency dependent ) diffractive scale falls below the inner scale , the phase structure function becomes quadratic , and the resulting spectral slope becomes @xmath25 .",
    "for an individual source this can result in a kolmogorov slope ( @xmath26 ) at high observing frequencies , while at low frequencies the influence of the inner scale effects causes it to drop to 4.0 . a very detailed modern discussion of the pulse shape analysis and the possibility of the inner scale estimation is given in @xcite .",
    "also , one has to remember that the theory presented above assumes an isotropic and homogeneous turbulence . as it was shown by @xcite the anisotropy will not change the frequency scaling of the scattering directly , but it may significantly affect the pulse shape , causing the scattering tail to decay with two different timescales .",
    "this may cause confusing results when trying to approach such profile with modeling , and affect the results obtained by applying a simple single - decay models .",
    "the inhomogeneity on the other hand may cause the scattering parameters to vary with time , as it was shown for low-@xmath1 pulsars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* an the references therein ) .",
    "also , for high @xmath1 pulsars the scattering may vary , even if the turbulence is homogeneous .",
    "all these effects may affect the observed spectral slope @xmath9 if the observations at different frequencies are performed at different epochs , and may cause the slope of the frequency dependence to fall below 4.0 , which is impossible in the homogeneous turbulence theory @xcite .    since the discovery of the ism effects in the observed pulsar radiation various authors tried to measure and analyze the properties of that interaction , and the attempts to estimate the scatter time spectrum ( or the decorrelation bandwidth spectrum ) are one of the most important , since it would allow us to estimate the properties of the density fluctuations in the ionized interstellar gas as the observed spectral index @xmath9 ( with the exceptions given above ) gives us a direct access to the spectrum of the density fluctuations .",
    "the most complete analysis so far was made by @xcite and their earlier paper , @xcite - l04 and l01 hereafter . in l04",
    "the authors gathered the measurements of the spectral index @xmath9 - from both the scatter time and decorrelation bandwidth - from the literature @xcite and after adding their own observations they were able to obtain the spectral index for a total number of 27 pulsars .",
    "probably the most important outcome of l01 and l04 was the observation that for pulsars with low dispersion measure ( @xmath27  pc  @xmath28 ) the spectral index @xmath9 stays in a good agreement with the kolmogorov s theory predictions ( although the authors noted a few peculiarities for a few of the nearby pulsars ) but for pulsars with large @xmath1 , i.e. the most distant ones in their sample , the value of @xmath9 deviates significantly from the predicted value of @xmath29 , making the spectra much flatter than expected ( down to @xmath30 , with an average of @xmath31 ) .",
    "the authors attributed this discrepancy mainly to the fact that for the most distant sources the probability of multiple scatterings along the line - of - sight significantly increases and such occurrence would make any predictions based on a single thin screen model inappropriate .",
    "in this paper we present our results of the scatter time measurements and the estimation of the spectral index @xmath9 for 25 pulsars , 22 of which were never previously analysed in this regard . in combination with the results of l01 and l04 we will try to interpret the observed trends and",
    "discuss the possible reasons behind the deviations from the values predicted by the commonly used simplified model ; deviations which we also noted for some of the pulsars from our sample .",
    "one has to also signify that the total number of pulsars which we study in this paper is almost twice as big as the sample that was available for l04 .",
    "the results of the measurements which are presented in this paper were collected over the course of another observing project , namely the search for gigahertz peaked spectra ( gps ) pulsars @xcite .",
    "that project involved the measurement of pulsar flux densities at several frequencies , using the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt , pune , india ) for the low - frequency observations at 325  mhz , 610  mhz and 1060  mhz , as well as the 100-meter effelsberg radiotelescope for the 2.6  ghz , 4.85  ghz and 8.35  ghz observations .",
    "the observations were conducted between 2005 and 2010 .",
    "the gmrt observations were conducted with 16  mhz bandwidth with the use of the telescope s phased array mode , with a sampling rate of 0.512  milliseconds , and 256 spectral channels across the band ( see * ? ? ? * for the receiving system details ) . since the original goal of the project was to measure pulsar flux densities , the observations were intensity - calibrated using measurements of known continuous sources ( like 1822 - 096 ) .",
    "the typical integration times were between 20 and 30 minutes , up to 1 hour in some selected cases ( i.e. very weak sources ) .",
    "more details about the specifics of our gmrt observations can be found in @xcite .    for the high frequency observations conducted with the 100-m radio telescope of the max - planck institute for radioastronomy at effelsberg we used the bandwidths of 100  mhz ( at 2.6  ghz ) , 500  mhz ( at 4.85 ) and 1.1 ghz ( at 8.35  ghz ) .",
    "we used secondary focus receivers equipped with cooled hemt amplifiers , providing lhc and rhc signals that were digitised and independently sampled at the rate of 1024 bins per pulse period and synchronously folded using the topocentric pulsar rotational period @xcite .",
    "again , the typical integration time was ca .",
    "30 minutes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the observations were intensity - calibrated by the use of a noise diode and known continuum radio - sources ( ngc 7027 , 3c 273 , 3c 286 ) .",
    "we found the sensitivity of our observations to be very good ( see the appendix of this paper and also table  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ranging from ca",
    ". 1  mjy at 325  mhz , to an average of 0.5  mjy at 610  mhz and even slightly better at 1060/1170  mhz . for the higher frequency observations with the use of the 100-meter effelsberg radiotelescope we reached the sensitivity of c.a",
    ". 0.1  mjy at 2.6  ghz ( and much better for some selected sources ) , to @xmath32  mjy at 4.85  ghz , and close to 0.01  mjy at 8.35  ghz . in most of the cases",
    "such sensitivity is good enough not only to measure the pulsars flux densities but also allows us to reliably study the profile shapes of the detected pulsars .",
    "the original goal of the project was to find pulsars with a high - frequency turn over in the spectrum .",
    "following the suggestion of @xcite that this phenomenon may be correlated with the pulsar dispersion measure , we have chosen a sample of sources with mid- to high - dispersion measures ( with a few exceptions ) , to estimate their flux densities and construct the spectra of these pulsars over a wide range of frequencies",
    ". the results of the spectral aspect of these observations were published by @xcite . over the course of our analysis we realised however that the data we gathered may be used for other purposes as well .",
    "specifically , one of the difficulties we encountered while trying to conduct the flux density measurements was the fact that the pulsar profiles we obtained were ( at low frequencies ) heavily affected by the interstellar scattering .",
    "the long scattering tails we detected on some of the pulsar profiles made the flux density measurements difficult .",
    "the flux measurement procedure requires finding of the profile background , and the long scattering tails - extending up to 300  degrees in pulsar phase from the main pulse - can make the estimation of the background level almost impossible .",
    "it was then that we realised that the data we gathered can be also used to measure the scattering effect itself .",
    "it occurred to us as well that the sample of pulsars we have chosen was the perfect extension of the work done by l01 and l04 ( see also section  [ intro ] ) .",
    "since our sample included mostly the pulsars that had only very few flux density measurements , naturally the majority of them did not have their scattering properties analysed and certainly not at the broad range of observing frequencies that would allow the analysis of the scattering vs. frequency dependence .",
    "thus we decided to analyse the data to measure the scattering effect for the pulsars in our sample .",
    "using the obtained pulse profiles we were also able to measure other profile parameters for the pulsars from our sample at several observing frequencies ( namely , the @xmath33 and @xmath34 pulse widths ) .",
    "these measurements , along with the classification of the pulsar profiles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the flux density measurements for several pulsars ( since not all of them were published before ) , and the profiles themselves can be found in the appendix to this paper .",
    "our scattering results were also partially published already - see @xcite .    to supplement our observations",
    "we also used some of the archived profiles from the databases available in the internet , namely the epn database and the atnf database , which were mainly used to obtain 1.4  ghz and 1.6  ghz profiles .",
    "two sample sets of the profiles we obtained can be seen in figures  [ 1557_prof ] and [ 1835_prof ] , showing the aligned profile shapes at 5 frequencies each .",
    "psr  b1557@xmath3550 , shown in fig .",
    "[ 1557_prof ] , is clearly showing a strong scattering effect , especially at the lower frequencies . despite the fact that the highest frequency shown is only 1560  mhz , and",
    "the lowest is 325  mhz , the shape of the profile changes from a gaussian - like with no detectable scattering tail to a smeared one with the tail extending over the whole 360 degrees .",
    "in fact the scatter time is in this case larger than the pulse period ( see section  [ errors ] ) .",
    "this , along with the noise in the profile , causes the apparent sharpness of the profile rise , as the slope of the scattering tail `` from the previous pulse '' probably distorts the wings of the supposedly gaussian - like rise of the pulse , making it to appear sharper .",
    "this is probably also the reason why the baseline just prior to the pulse looks almost flat , while with a scatter time so big it should be sloped .",
    "the opposite is the case of psr  j1835@xmath351020 , shown in figure  [ 1835_prof ] , where almost no shape change can be seen by eye and yet the range of the observing frequencies at which those profiles were obtained is much greater ( 610  mhz to 8.35  ghz ) .",
    "of course , the scattering effect depends strongly on the observing frequency , and the fact that the latter source was not observed at 325  mhz may `` smear '' the picture .",
    "the other source of this striking difference may be the fact that psr  b1557@xmath3550 has a @xmath1 of 260  pc  @xmath28 , and for psr  j1835@xmath351020 the dispersion is lower by a factor of 2.5 ( @xmath36  pc  @xmath28 ) .",
    "also , the goal of our project was to estimate the properties of the scattering phenomenon not only qualitatively but also quantitatively .",
    "it has to be noted , that due to the nature of the original observing project , the multi - frequency observations were not conducted simultaneously .",
    "while usually for a single source the individual low - frequency observations ( performed at gmrt ) were separated by a few days ( up to two weeks ) , and the same stands for the high - frequency observations ( at the effelsberg telescope ) , the separation between the low and high - frequency observations epochs may be of the order of a few months , or even years .",
    "additionally , some of the profiles from the epn database we used to supplement our sample were conducted in 1990 s , several years before our project started .",
    "this has to be taken into account when trying to interpret the results .      to estimate the strength of the scattering phenomenon in the obtained profiles",
    ", we used the method developed by l01 , l04 .",
    "in general , the observed pulse profile is the convolution of the intrinsic profile shape @xmath37 with :    * the scattering smearing function @xmath38 , * the dispersion smearing function @xmath39 ; this function describes the smearing by the interstellar dispersion of the signal , which is present here due to a finite bandwidth of the filterbank used * the impulse response of the backend used @xmath40 .",
    "the response times of the modern receiver systems are fast enough that we can assume the effect of @xmath40 to be negligible .",
    "the dispersion smearing function @xmath39 is in general a rectangular function in the case of an incoherent dedispersion ( which was the case for the receiver systems we used ) . as it was mentioned before , for the low - frequency observations we were using the gmrt 256-channel filterbank system with 16  mhz bandwidth , which yields the channel width of 62.5  khz . for a pulsar with @xmath44  pc  @xmath28 it means the dispersion smearing is of the order of 1.5  millisecond , while it is naturally 5 times larger for a @xmath45 pulsar ( 7.5  ms ) . with the 0.512  ms sampling rate we used , those values mean ,",
    "that for most of the pulsars from our sample ( mid- to high - dispersion measure ) this effect will introduce a smearing of between a few up to ca .",
    "20 samples in the obtained profiles . for a typical 0.5 second pulsar",
    "this corresponds to 1 - 2% of a pulse window and thus the dispersion smearing will significantly affect the observed shape of the profile ( since for most pulsars its intrinsic width is usually around a few percent ) .",
    "this was not a problem for our original project goal ( the flux density measurements ) , since only the shape of the profile is changed but the amount of energy integrated over a broad - enough pulse window stays constant . for the purposes of the scattering measurements",
    "however one has to take it into consideration .",
    "while our low - frequency observations may have suffered a significant dispersion smearing due to a fact that this effect is stronger at lower frequencies , one has to remember about it at the higher frequencies as well . while the dispersion gets weaker , the high observing frequency filterbank receivers tend to use much wider bandwidths . since our initial goal was not dependant on the profile shape , and we only wanted to make sure that we measure all the incoming energy , for the observations with the 100-meter effelsberg radiotelescope we used the maximum available bandwidths , even at the cost of not being able to dedisperse the data .",
    "this means that our high frequency observations will suffer the dispersion smearing due to wide bandwidths , i.e. 500  mhz at 4.85  ghz and 1.1  ghz bandwidth at 8.35  ghz . again , for a @xmath46 pulsar this translates to a dispersion smearing of @xmath47  millisecond , or 20  ms ( ca .",
    "4% of the cycle ) for a pulsar with @xmath48 ( and a period of 0.5 seconds ) .    the @xmath38 component in eq .",
    "[ profile_shape ] describes the broadening of a pulse due to the interstellar scattering .",
    "different mathematical forms were used to model this effect but as it was discussed by l04 a simple exponential decay function seems to work best for highly dispersed pulsars ( which was the case for most of the objects in our sample ) ; a function that describes scattering on a single thin screen ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in our analysis we assumed that the scatter broadening @xmath38 has a form of @xmath49 function from l04 :        to find the values of @xmath7 for the observed profiles we performed a least squares fit of a model shape to the observational data , to find a best fit parameters by minimizing the @xmath54 function ( l01 ) :      where @xmath56 is the off - pulse rms , @xmath57 is the number of bins on the observed profile @xmath41 is the observed profile , and the @xmath58 is the model profile which besides the scatter time @xmath7 has additional three free parameters : the amplitude scaling factor @xmath59 , the profile background level @xmath60 , and the phase @xmath61 .",
    "the fit itself was performed using the _ origin _ software . since we do not know the intrinsic pulse profile ( this is in general impossible to get ) we used a convolution of a simple gaussian profile with the exponential decay due to the scatter broadening .",
    "this may be viewed as a simplified approach , but on the other hand - since we already had to deal with the dispersion broadening ( due to the very low observing frequencies or wide bandwidths used at high frequencies , see the discussion above ) - we decided that it was well justified .",
    "we were hesitant to use high frequency profiles as templates , as they were dispersion - broadened as well , and additionally one can not exclude the possible effects of intrinsic profile changes with the observing frequency ( like profile evolution and radius - to - frequency mapping ) .",
    "these effects would ruin any attempts to use the unscattered high frequency profiles as the templates for the low - frequency scatter - broadening fit .",
    "one has to add however that our simplified approach introduces an additional parameter to the model profile @xmath58 , i.e. the ( half)width of the gaussian profile .    in the cases of a clearly multi - component profiles ( i.e.",
    "double ones , like j1809@xmath351917 in the appendix ) the fit was usually performed to the second ( trailing ) component only .",
    "we used this only when the profile components were clearly separated , which would ensure that the scattering tail of the leading component would add only a negligible contribution to the tail of the trailing component , that was used for the actual fit .",
    "table  [ tau_table ] presents our measurements of the scatter time @xmath7 for our observations , as well as the results we obtained for profiles that were found in various databases available in the web , that we used to supplement our observations ( for better frequency coverage ) .",
