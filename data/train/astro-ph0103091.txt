    "it was not long after kalnajs ( @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) and others had laid out a programme to perform stability analyses for galactic disks that it was applied to the mestel disk by zang ( @xcite ; henceforth cited as zang ) in a ph.d .  thesis supervised by alar  toomre .",
    "this disk , characterised by an infinitesimal height and a globally constant rotation curve , lends itself as a model for disks that show spiral structure mainly for two reasons . for one ,",
    "its structure is so simple that one of its distribution functions has made it into a textbook example ( binney  &  tremaine @xcite ) ; secondly , and probably more importantly , flat rotation curves seem to be rather prevalent among ( high surface brightness ) spiral galaxies ( e.g. , persic  &  salucci @xcite ) , and it has long been suspected that flat rotation curves and strong , `` modal - looking '' spiral structure are somehow linked ( e.g. , biviano et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the drawbacks of the mestel disk is that the orbits in it can not be expressed in elementary functions .",
    "zang circumvented this problem essentially through numerical integration and some elegant devices exploiting the self - similarity of the mestel disk ( i.e. , orbits of a given eccentricity look like scaled copies of each other regardless of the angular momentum of a particle on them ) to curb down on the computational effort .",
    "while the self - similarity is welcome in simplifying the calculation , it also implies that a self - consistent mestel disk does not possess any scales .",
    "in particular , the absence of a time scale already leads to the expectation that discrete modes will be hard to construct .",
    "zang found that the mestel disk is a rather bewildering construct .",
    "his formalism leads to a singular integral equation that is quite difficult to treat numerically .",
    "however , the structure of its kernel as well as physical arguments suggest that there are no discrete modes apart from rather exotic non - rotating and non - growing ones , implying that either no growing modes exist or modes become unstable regardless of their growth rate and pattern speed .",
    "thus , his investigations concentrated on a variant of the mestel disk in which a certain part of the disk is declared `` immobile '' , the cut - out disk .",
    "this tampered system is furnished with a length scale , admits discrete modes and becomes treatable with his numeric technique .",
    "but even the cut - out disk behaves contrary to the preconceptions of the mid-70ies .",
    "while zang would have liked to see a mildly unstable two - armed mode , typically the only mode that is growing in an axisymmetrically stable disk is a one - armed mode , and for this , a stability limit can not be found . even when he made the inner cut - out so steep that @xmath0 modes emerged in axisymmetrically stable disks in a way that toomre ( @xcite ) describes as unrealistic , these one - armed modes , again in toomre s words continued to `` plague '' him .    despite these somewhat unexpected findings and",
    "the fact that is was only fragmentarily published in toomre ( @xcite ) and toomre ( @xcite ) , zang s thesis became a frequently - cited classic and the mestel disk developed a life of its own .",
    "recently , evans & read ( @xcite , @xcite ; see also read ( @xcite ; henceforth cited as eri and erii ) generalised zang s work to the entire family of physically plausible disks with surface densities following a power law , and goodman  &  evans ( @xcite ) once more tackled the issue of rotating modes the untampered ( self - consistent ) mestel disk .",
    "this work set out as an attempt to avoid the numerical integrations that had to be employed by zang and eri by approximating the orbits and eventually deriving a closed kernel of the integral equation governing the problem . among the merits of the availability of such a kernel is that an analytic expression for the kernel might allow a decision whether or not the self - consistent mestel disk admits rotating modes . also , it might facilitate an analysis of the processes at work at various resonances of the modes in the cut - out disk in the context of a full disk without having to take recourse to somewhat daring techniques to extend wkbj approximations across resonances ( e.g. , mark @xcite ) .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows : in section  2 , we derive the orbits and the hamiltonian of the disk .",
    "section  3 basically follows kalnajs programme that will in the end yield an ( almost ) closed expression for the kernel of an integral equation governing the modes in the disk . to assess the validity of this kernel",
    ", we will compare the results reported in erii with ours in section  4 .",
    "finally , we revisit the issue of modes in the self - consistent disk in section  5 .",
    "the equations of motion in the mestel disk are @xmath1 here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote polar coordinates , and @xmath4 is the @xmath5-component of the angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "units have been chosen such that the circular velocity @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath8 is the surface density at a reference radius that can be set to unity because of the self - similarity of the disk .",
    "we seek closed expressions for the solution of the equations ( [ eqmotmestel ] ) .",
    "since the exact solutions can not be expressed in elementary functions , we need to employ some approximation . a straightforward linearisation in configuration space  the epicyclic approximation",
    " fails for the mestel disk , since the hamiltonian derived from it does not contain contributions from non - circular motion components .",
    "therefore we linearise in fourier space , a procedure generally known as the method of harmonic balance ( bogoliubov  &  mitropolski @xcite ) .    inserting one of the equations ( [ eqmotmestel ] ) into the other yields @xmath9 we now substitute @xmath10 , making @xmath11 the reference radius of a given orbit , @xmath12 a measure for its deviation from circularity , and @xmath13 an epicyclic frequency .",
    "after this , the first fourier coefficients of ( [ eqmotmesteln ] ) with respect to @xmath14 are @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the cosine and sine coefficients , respectively .    dropping all higher fourier coefficients and substituting the result back into ( [ eqmotmesteln ] )",
    ", one finds by comparing the terms independent of @xmath14 @xmath18 and by comparing terms proportional to @xmath19 @xmath20 the circular frequency of the guiding centre @xmath21 results from a fourier transformation of the second equation in ( [ eqmotmestel ] ) with ( [ lzdeflong ] ) inserted and is given by @xmath22    we can now derive the hamiltonian for a mass point in the mestel disk in action - angle coordinates by simply inserting ( [ lzdeflong ] ) , ( [ kappadeflong ] ) , and ( [ omegadeflong ] ) into an hamiltonian written in cartesian coordinates . assuming orbits not too far from circularity",
    ", one can linearise with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "after again dropping all fourier components of order 2  or higher , one is left with @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the energy in the epicyclic motion divided by @xmath13 and thus the second integral .",
    "this clearly is the simplest hamiltonian that could have anything to do with a mestel disk and indeed the hamiltonian that would result from a classic epicyclic approximation if it worked . as a matter of fact ,",
    "at this point one has @xmath25 and @xmath26 , reproducing the result of an epicyclic analysis .",
    "this hamiltonian has already been used by collett et .",
    "al .  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the set of approximated action - angle coordinates @xmath4 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is correct to first order in @xmath12 , and the canonical equations are correct to first order in @xmath12 as well .",
    "as is demonstrated in demleitner ( @xcite ) , the jacobian of the transformation between cartesian coordinates and this set is @xmath30 , showing that the transformation is indeed canonical to the required order .",
    "because of the two approximations ( only keeping the lowest fourier coefficients and linearising with respect to @xmath12 ) , it is not _ a priori _ clear that the disk described by this transformation and the resulting hamiltonian ( [ linhamil ] ) does indeed behave like a mestel disk .",
    "it is one of the purposes of this work to show _ a posteriori _ , at is were , that this is the case .",
    "with the hamiltonian and the transformation equations , we can now follow the programme outlined in the series of papers by kalnajs cited above . the first step is to establish a base for the potential perturbation .",
    "we choose @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is the number of circumferential maxima of the spiral pattern ( the number of arms ) , and @xmath33 parametrises how closely the spiral is wound , where a spiral with larger @xmath33 is more trailing provided that @xmath34 .",
    "this expression basically is the well - known logarithmic spiral @xmath35 transformed into our action - angle coordinates with harmonics in the angle coordinates higher than one disregarded .",
    "the factor @xmath36 was added to ensure definiteness in the integration of the angular momentum .",
    "this analogy motivates following eri in naming @xmath33 the logarithmic wave number and @xmath32 the angular harmonic number .",
    "we assume that all potential perturbations can be represented as expansions of the form @xmath37    the next step in kalnajs programme is to solve the linearised boltzmann equation @xmath38=-[f_0,\\phi_{\\alpha , m}],\\label{linbol}\\ ] ] written with poisson brackets @xmath39 $ ] for an elementary perturbations @xmath40 of the form ( [ potbaslin ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath41 is the unknown perturbation of the distribution function , and @xmath42 an equilibrium distribution function ; for @xmath42 , we use the distribution function given by binney  &  tremaine ( @xcite ) , which , in our units and coordinates , and after applying stirling s formula , is @xmath43    expanding the poisson brackets in ( [ linbol ] ) yields @xmath44 with an auxiliary function @xmath45 . on the right - hand side of this equation , a term of order",
    "@xmath46 has been neglected .    to solve this equation",
    ", we perform a separation of variables by @xmath47 and arrive at an inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation , the homogeneous solution of which is @xmath48 the general solution can be obtained via a variation of constants , where the integration constant is fixed by the condition that the distribution function must be @xmath49-periodic , @xmath50 .    before writing down the result",
    ", we note that in ( [ bolexp ] ) the terms with @xmath51 in the exponent and its coefficient are quite similar to each other .",
    "this invites a partial integration in the resulting expression , which after some algebra leads to @xmath52 in this expression , we have abbreviated @xmath53 .    substituting ( [ solc ] ) into ( [ sepans ] ) yields the perturbation of the distribution function under an elementary potential perturbation @xmath54 . since ( [ linbol ] ) is linear in @xmath54 , the response to an arbitrary perturbation @xmath55 of the form ( [ potexpansion ] )",
    "can immediately be computed by summing over all @xmath33 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the solution of ( [ linbol ] ) can be written as @xmath56 with a linear integral operator @xmath57 .",
    "further pursuing kalnajs programme , we attempt to find a linear combination of elementary perturbations such that @xmath58 causes the @xmath59 we started with . to do this",
    ", the poisson equation has to be solved simultaneously to the boltzmann equation .",
    "since @xmath57 and the laplacian occurring in the poisson equation do not commute , their eigenfunctions are different , and a straightforward attempt to solve the two equations simultaneously will result in an integro - differential equation that will be very hard to solve indeed .    to avoid this , one converts the system of equations to a matrix equation .",
    "the idea here is to compute potential - density pairs , i.e. , two sets of mutually orthogonal basis functions @xmath54 and @xmath60 for each of the perturbations in density and potential where each pair @xmath61 satisfies the poisson equation .",
    "when one expands the perturbations in the potential and the surface density in these functions , the poisson equation simply reads @xmath62 in the coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 of these expansions .",
    "the basis @xmath54 is already fixed by ( [ potbaslin ] ) , and the corresponding density base function can be found using the scheme of clutton - brock ( @xcite ) .",
    "for our calculation , however , the only important property of the potential - density pair the scalar product of @xmath54 and @xmath60 .",
    "this scalar product is of course invariant under canonical transformations , and to the the required order clutton - brock s result @xmath65 for logarithmic spirals holds . here",
    ", @xmath66 is a quantity closely related to eri s kalnajs factor .",
    "after expanding the potential and surface density perturbations in ( [ opeq ] ) , one can project both sides on @xmath67 .",
    "exploiting ( [ basscalprod ] ) and inserting the ( now trivial ) poisson equation , ( [ opeq ] ) takes the form @xmath68 equating @xmath69 and @xmath70 , an integral equation results the solutions of which , if they exist , are self - consistent modes .",
    "the integrand of ( [ mateq ] ) can be written as a sum @xmath71 of a part without a further integral , @xmath72 and one in which a further integration over the auxiliary angle @xmath73 has to be performed , @xmath74    the quadratures over @xmath75 , @xmath51 , and @xmath27 , carried out in that order , are rather straightforward .",
    "details can be found in demleitner ( @xcite ) .",
    "when integrating over @xmath73 one has to evaluate an expression of the type @xmath76 which can be done by expanding the second factor of the integrand into modified bessel functions @xmath77 using @xmath78 ( abramowitz  &  stegun @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the series introduced by this operation does not in general collapse and will be present in the kernel .",
    "the integration over the angular momentum is the most involved one , resembling the calculations to compute the angular momentum function in zang s formalism . for the summands of the series resulting from the @xmath73 integration",
    ", one has to treat integrals of the structure @xmath79 where @xmath80 ( note that this substitution only works for nonzero @xmath32 and @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the integer @xmath84 is a summation index varying between @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and the complete integral requires this expression to be evaluated for @xmath87 .",
    "we will compute this integral using the residue theorem , and thus the first step is to find the zeroes of the denominator of the integrand .",
    "these are at @xmath88 for integer @xmath89 .",
    "these zeroes are well - defined , since @xmath90 , as the ratio of two integers , can never be equal to @xmath91 .",
    "let for the moment @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "there are three more or less technical problems in the application of the residue theorem to this integral .",
    "the first is that at least one pole is on the real axis and hence on the integration contour .",
    "the tempting idea to take the ( existing ) cauchy principal value leads to erroneous results . as landau ( @xcite )",
    "noted in a plasma - physical context , the correct reasoning is that if a system supports a non - growing perturbation at present and started in equilibrium , the perturbation must have been a growing one at some time in the past .",
    "since it has evolved continuously , the integration contours of the problem must have been continuously deformed as well and thus can not have jumped across poles .",
    "a growing perturbation corresponds to an @xmath81 with a positive imaginary part , which with the substitution ( [ udef ] ) means that the integration contour moves into the upper half - plane .",
    "therefore , as @xmath94 , one has to leave the zeroes on the real axis out of the contour , as is sketched in fig .",
    "[ intpath ] .",
    "the second problem is that as the size of the integration path @xmath95 ( cf .",
    "[ intpath ] ) one can not continuously deform the contour since the poles are in the way , and the same poles make it hard to establish that the contribution of the line at @xmath96 vanishes .",
    "the standard technique to avoid this is to write down the series of residues and show that integral over the difference between this series and the integrand vanishes as @xmath95 .",
    "since this differences has no poles , the contour can be readily deformed .",
    "the last problem is that for @xmath97 the contributions at @xmath98 do not necessarily vanish .",
    "indeed , one finds that these `` border terms '' @xmath99    of course , the limits occurring in these expressions do not exist . however , it should be remembered that this integral is being evaluated as part of the kernel of an integral equation .",
    "therefore , the limits can ( and have to ) be taken in the sense of a distribution limit , @xmath100 .    with these tools , one can go about evaluating the residues of the integrand , which can easily be done using @xmath101 and an application of de lhospital s rule",
    ". we will give the end result below .",
    "a few words about the other cases are in order .",
    "first , if @xmath102 , the poles at @xmath103 move away from the real axis ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ intpath ] ) .",
    "one can keep the expression resulting for @xmath104 by choosing an appropriate branch of the logarithm in the result .",
    "basically , one has to see to it that the @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ intpath ] `` shift down '' rather than `` up '' by @xmath105 . to ensure this , one sets @xmath106 , and with @xmath107 a natural branch cut",
    "is along the positive imaginary axis , so that @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath109 , one has to integrate through the lower half - plane , and consequently the poles on the real axis are added into the residue sum .",
    "the resulting expression is , of course , identical to the one for @xmath93 .    after carrying out all integrations and the summation of @xmath32 ( which is trivial",
    "because the integration over @xmath75 contributes a @xmath110 , thus decoupling different angular harmonics ) , ( [ mateq ] ) takes the form @xmath111 the summand with @xmath112 originates from the terms with @xmath113-functions and computes to @xmath114    the kernel itself becomes @xmath115 where we have abbreviated @xmath116    formally , ( [ skernform ] ) is an integral equation of the second kind .",
    "however , @xmath117 is not compact  the infinite integration range and the singularity on the @xmath118 diagonal prevent this  , and thus the solution theory for it is significantly different from what one has in the fredholm case .",
    "we will return to this issue later .",
    "for now , let us just follow zang in noting that @xmath81 factors out of the kernel , and thus the value of @xmath81 is irrelevant for the solvability of this equation .    the special case of @xmath119 has not been treated so far .",
    "it is interesting for two reasons : for one , when searching for the limit of axisymmetric stability , it suffices to consider @xmath119 , since axisymmetric patterns can not rotate anyway and considering growth is not necessary for establishing the stability margin , and for two , `` neutral '' modes ( for which @xmath119 even when @xmath120 ) were the only modes the existence of which erii and zang report for the self - consistent disk .",
    "the expression ( [ skernkdef ] ) can not be taken to the limit @xmath121 , because @xmath122 in general has an essential singularity at @xmath119 , which according to picard s theorem implies that the image of an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of 0 is the entire complex plane with the possible exception of one point .",
    "instead , one has to substitute @xmath119 before the integration over @xmath4 .",
    "this simplifies the terms quite significantly , resulting in @xmath123 the integral equation has now collapsed into the algebraic equation @xmath124 which clearly simplifies solving the equation by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the mestel disk has three rather bizarre properties : its mass is infinite , the surface density is not bounded in the centre , and it does not possess a natural time - scale .",
    "all these shortcomings can be cured by a relatively simple measure that was already employed by zang .",
    "the idea is to immobilise a radially varying part of the mass , declaring it as , say , halo or bulge .",
    "thus one keeps the simple structure of the disk , but cuts the singularity in the centre and possibly the long mass tail out to infinity as far as the boltzmann equation is concerned .",
    "also , the cut - out will break the self - similarity and thus introduces a time scale .    as an added benefit ,",
    "the ratio of active to total mass and thus ( at radially constant velocity dispersion ) toomre s stability parameter @xmath125 ( toomre @xcite ) becomes a function of the radius , opening the possibility to introduce a @xmath125-barrier in the disk .",
    "in such a @xmath125-barrier , incoming waves are refracted away from the centre and thereby evade their absorption at the inner lindblad resonance . in common semi - phenomenological theories of spiral structure ( bertin et .",
    "@xcite ) , this @xmath125-barrier serves as a part of a feedback loop , to be closed by , e.g. , the corotation at which swing amplification ( toomre @xcite ) or related mechanisms would not only provide reflection but even amplification of wave packets .    in the shearing sheet ( goldreich  &  lynden - bell @xcite , julian  &  toomre @xcite )",
    ", it is possible to show rigorously that the introduction of something quite similar to a @xmath125-barrier leads to the emergence of stationary modes where no such modes are present in the classic border - less analyses ( fuchs @xcite ) .",
    "technically , the immobilisation of the mass is done by multiplying the distribution function with a cut - out function @xmath126 , with @xmath127 , while keeping the hamiltonian and thus the rotation curve unchanged .",
    "since the main objective of our investigation of the cut - out disk was an assessment of the quality of our approximation , we used the cut - out function used by eri ( who in turn basically used what zang had suggested ) . in our case",
    ", the introduction of the cut - out has the effect of eliminating the border terms in the @xmath4 integration , but only if one uses zang s doubly cut - out disk ( i.e. , the cut - out function tends to zero for both @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) .",
    "zang s family of cut - out functions is parametrised by two positive integers @xmath130 and @xmath131 , the cut - out indices , describing the steepness of the cut - outs in the outskirts and centre of the disk , respectively . since both of these integers appear as the order of poles of the integrand in the @xmath4 integration , and the residues at these poles get very messy indeed as their order increases , we settled for the case @xmath132 , resulting in a cut - out function @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are two parameters qualifying the locations of the inner and outer cut - outs ; following erii , we usually use @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "it should be noted that for further analytic exploration of the cut - out disk , this cut - out is not favourable , since it still leads to a very cumbersome kernel .",
    "a cut - out of @xmath138 results in a much more compact kernel and reproduces the overall behaviour the cut - out disk ( due to its lower active surface density , the resulting disk has an even higher stability than one with zang s cut - out , though ) .",
    "since the cut - out function ( [ readcutout ] ) only depends on @xmath4 , most of the calculations done for the self - consistent disk just carry over .",
    "the integration over @xmath4 becomes somewhat easier , since there are no border terms , but this advantage is more than offset by the sheer length of the terms and the occurrence of higher - order poles .",
    "the resulting integral equation has an `` almost '' compact kernel , with no singularity on the diagonal and a relatively sharp decline of the kernel as @xmath33 and @xmath139 approach infinity .",
    "consequently , eri s naive approach of simply fredholm - discretizing the integral equation and cutting off at some appropriate @xmath33 still works well .",
    "the only difference to eri s method of solving this integral equation was that we found a spline - based quadrature to converge faster than the integration scheme proposed by them .    skipping the details  which can be found in demleitner ( @xcite )  , let us briefly compare the stability of disks described with our approximation with read s findings . since erii mostly report results for singly cut - out disks which are not favourable for an anaylsis using our tools , we give the values from read s ( @xcite ) more comprehensive tables .",
    "our disks become unstable to axisymmetric ( @xmath140 ) perturbations at @xmath141 ; read only gives values for @xmath142 , where we find @xmath143 versus read s @xmath144 .",
    "this agreement to within roughly 5% is remarkable considering the relatively high temperature of this disk .",
    "the higher stability of the disk with lower @xmath135 is mostly due to its lower active surface density .",
    "the one - armed ( @xmath145 ) modes investigated in erii behave somewhat erratic in that at vanishing growth rate and @xmath146 in that there seem to be modes for almost arbitrary @xmath147 . that , however , is a consequence of the fact that erii performed these computations without an outer cut - out . introducing an outer cut - out , the disk seems to become stable at @xmath148 , although clearly at that point the assumption of a razor - thin disk becomes quite unrealistic and @xmath149 is severely violated .    in the ",
    "at least historically  most interesting case of two - armed ( @xmath0 ) modes , our disks become unstable at @xmath150 with a pattern speed @xmath151 , whereas read finds @xmath152 and @xmath153",
    ". thus , not only is the qualitative result that the @xmath132 cut - out disk is stable with respect to two - armed perturbations reproduced , the quantitative agreement again is far better than one might expect given the rather severe assumptions that go into our model .",
    "read ( @xcite ) does not give stability limits for the @xmath154 and @xmath155 perturbations in doubly cut - out disks , but a comparison of the eigenvalue plots leads to the expectation that our results ",
    "@xmath156 at @xmath157 for @xmath154 and @xmath158 at @xmath159 for @xmath155  would again reproduce the results of the more exact calculations quite well .",
    "the @xmath155 stability limit has to be taken with a grain of salt , since our formalism reproduces modes at high velocity dispersion as @xmath121 in accordance with read s findings .",
    "it is remarkable , though , that these modes are not quenched by an outer cut - out like their @xmath140 brethren .",
    "the properties of the modes computed from the kernels are , by and large , identical to those discussed by erii , and our model even shows more subtle features like the rapid overtaking of eigenvalues when @xmath155 .    as to comparison to simulations ,",
    "the fact that the expressions get very unwieldy for larger @xmath130 and @xmath131 is somewhat unfortunate .",
    "sellwood  &  evans ( 2001 ) point out that for the global mode to dominate over particle noise in simulations , it is highly desirable to maintain a high amplification , implying steep cut - outs and thus relatively large cut - out indices .",
    "the values chosen by sellwood  &  evans for their `` standard '' disk , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , are beyond the reasonable range of applicability for our approach . however , they compute a doubly cut - out model that does not possess any global modes at @xmath162 ( remember that @xmath125 refers to the axisymmetric stability of the self - consistent disk ) and state that the @xmath163 and @xmath164 disk with @xmath136 becomes stable with respect to @xmath145 perturbations below @xmath165 .",
    "the rotation curve they use in this model is falling but only very slightly so , so that a disk with a completely flat rotation curve should behave analogously . indeed , ignoring the `` rogue '' eigenvalues ( demleitner 2000 )  that become relevant in this model  , we find that even the @xmath145 mode gets quenched below @xmath166 .",
    "summarising , our approximation does well in reproducing the results from the previous calculations for the cut - out disks . for now , the value of this insight is rather limited , since one still has to take recourse to numerical integration to solve the integral equation , and the numerics are computationally about as expensive as those in zang s formalism , since the expression for the kernel is very large .",
    "still , using a cut - out more suitable to our formalism results in more compact and manageable expressions that might facilitate a closer look at the interplay between the @xmath125-barrier , the various resonances , and density waves in a full - disk analytical model .",
    "the axisymmetric stability of the self - consistent disk can be determined by solving the algebraic equation ( [ somzerointeq ] ) with a kernel still somewhat simpler than ( [ somzerokernel ] ) that is the result of setting @xmath140 in ( [ intgrone ] ) and ( [ intgrtwo ] ) , yielding @xmath167 with @xmath168 , within 2% of read s ( @xcite ) values of @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "since the integral equation describing the self - consistent disk for non - axisymmetric modes is highly singular , zang s formalism could not provide solutions for the full problem .",
    "however , it did yield a family of rather exotic modes characterised by @xmath119 and consisting of a single logarithmic spiral  the neutral modes .",
    "it should be noted that these single logarithmic spirals are scale - free , a property that sets them apart from from any other disturbance of the form ( [ potexpansion ] ) . in our formalism , they can be computed by solving the algebraic equation ( [ somzerointeq ] ) with the kernel ( [ somzerokernel ] ) .",
    "the resulting behaviour again agrees very well with the findings of erii and zang and has to be called rather peculiar : one - armed perturbations can not be stabilised at all , two - armed modes set in below @xmath171 ( or @xmath172 according to read ( @xcite ) ) , three - armed ones are extremely stable and do not set in down to at least @xmath173 , whereas four - armed neutral modes again can not be stabilised at all .",
    "the neutral modes come in pairs , i.e. , if a mode with logarithmic wave number @xmath33 exists , so does one with @xmath174 .",
    "this is a consequence of the anti - spiral theorem ( lynden - bell  &  ostriker @xcite ) , since these neutral modes are not limits of growing modes .",
    "the marginal modes in the cut - out disk and possibly existing modes with nonzero @xmath81 in the self - consistent disk , on the other hand , are limits of growing modes by the application of landau s rule and thus not subject to the anti - spiral theorem .",
    "erii , from their perspective of analysing the entire family of physically viable power - law disks , briefly hypothesised that the stability properties might be related to the emergence of closed orbits of a given symmetry ; these would , according to her reasoning , absorb power from perturbations and stabilise the disks when present . in our model ,",
    "no closed orbits at all exist , since the ratio of epicyclic and orbital frequencies is fixed and irrational .",
    "as the model reproduces the stability properties found by erii nevertheless , one has to look for a different explanation .    turning to ( [ somzerokernel ] )",
    ", one sees that the contribution from the terms except the one with the sum is fairly independent of @xmath32 , whereas the sum does significantly change its value with @xmath32 .",
    "the term to watch here is the @xmath175 .",
    "when @xmath176 , the corresponding summand is much larger than its neighbours since the ratio @xmath177 and @xmath178 basically is @xmath84 ( plus some constant ) and everything else does not depend on @xmath84 ; when @xmath32 is not too large , that `` resonant '' summand will dominate the value of the entire series .",
    "the sign of this resonant summand is determined by the side relative to the nearest @xmath84 on which @xmath179 reaches its minimum  for the @xmath154 series , the near - resonance is at @xmath180 and thus one has a positive contribution with @xmath181 that enters into the kernel negatively ( enhancing stability ) , whereas the resonance for the @xmath155 occurs for @xmath182 and thus destabilises the disk .",
    "the next azimuthal harmonic that has an @xmath32 close to a @xmath183 is 7 , and it is again negative ; not surprisingly , the @xmath184 harmonic is quite unstable as well .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath84 has no immediate meaning in physical terms , although ( [ solc ] ) , suggests that the @xmath84-th terms of the series in ( [ somzerokernel ] ) should determine the response in the @xmath84-th harmonic in the epicyclic angle @xmath51 . in the denominator of the resonance term @xmath185 ,",
    "the factor @xmath186 is simply the epicyclic frequency , so that we seem to see a resonance between the frequency with which a body in the disk encounters a forcing , @xmath187 , and a harmonic of the epicyclic frequency , @xmath188 , which is a natural frequency a body wants to respond with .",
    "if the forcing is near resonant with the response times the epicyclic frequency but has a slightly higher angular symmetry , the response is damped , whereas in the reverse case it is amplified , a behaviour common in forced oscillations .",
    "this resembles the situation at a lindblad resonance , with the difference that for one , the resonance is not exact ( if it were , the series would evaluate to infinity ) , and , for second , it occurs on the entire disk .",
    "let us now turn to the general case of rotating modes . as has been hinted at above , the main discomfort with the notion of modes in the singular disk",
    "is that in its governing equation @xmath81 factors out , so that without further devices a disk is either stable or becomes unstable at all growth rates and pattern speeds at once .",
    "this seems weird enough to dismiss the possibility of such modes . on the other hand",
    ", this would imply that even a completely cold disk would be stable to all non - axisymmetric perturbations , which again would be quite an exotic situation .",
    "quite recently , goodman  &  evans ( @xcite ) have tackled the problem employing the jeans equations .",
    "the basic results of their work are that the mestel disk s weirdness starts in its centre , and once one fixes boundary conditions there , the mestel disk becomes quite tame . without that boundary condition , however , the problem is not well - posed . by the requirement that the centre does not absorb or emit energy , they curb down the two - dimensional continuum of solutions to a spectrum of one - dimensional continua , in which the ratio between growth rate and pattern speed is fixed and only the phase of @xmath81 remains unknown .",
    "even this ambiguity can be removed by fixing the phase shift during the reflection of a wave at the disk s centre , thus reducing the spectrum to a countable set of discrete points ; however , there is nothing in the equilibrium model that would allow the definition of this phase change .    with a closed expression for the kernel of the mestel disk ,",
    "one is in a position to reconsider the stellar - dynamical equivalent of goodman  &  evans problem using the tools of the theory of singular integral equations : does the integral equation ( [ skernform ] ) admit continuous solutions , and if , for what disk parameters ?    the kernel ( [ skernkdef ] ) governing the self - consistent disk has a cauchy - type singularity on the diagonal , implying that the operator @xmath189 is not compact , so that the familiar fredholm theory can not be applied . for the treatment of integral equations of this type , muskhelishvili ( @xcite ) and",
    "his coworkers have developed a theory .",
    "a nice summary is found in the more modern work of polyanin  &  manzhirov ( @xcite ) .",
    "the following discussion is based on these works .",
    "the integral equation ( [ skernform ] ) has the form @xmath190 where @xmath191 is at least hlder continuous , @xmath192 is the real axis ( integration over the real axis is henceforth implied for integral signs ) , and , of course , the integral is to be understood as a cauchy principal value . in the present case , @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the multiplication with @xmath195 ensures that the kernel is bounded on the diagonal , since the single zero in the denominator stemming from @xmath196 now cancels out .",
    "the only part of the kernel that could jeopardise the condition of hlder continuity is the square root , but since only @xmath197 is present in the arguments of the square roots , @xmath191 does indeed satisfy a hlder condition .    it is convenient to rewrite ( [ gencau ] ) to the equivalent form @xmath198 where @xmath199 after this manipulation , @xmath200 is a compact operator , whereas @xmath201 known as the dominant or characteristic part of the integral equation , decides whether or not the integral equation has a nontrivial solution . for our equation , @xmath202 .    to find a solution of ( [ charkerndef ] ) ,",
    "let us introduce an auxiliary function @xmath203 defined for complex @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath63 is continuous  this is henceforth assumed  , this function is piecewise analytic in the upper and lower half planes but may be discontinuous across the real axis .",
    "the merit of this auxiliary function is that it allows a transformation of the problem of the solution of the integral equation ( [ charkerndef ] ) into a riemann boundary value problem .",
    "this can be done by applying the sokhotski - plemelj formulae , that , in their formulation for the real axis , state that when @xmath204 and @xmath205 are linked by ( [ caupsifundef ] ) , @xmath206 hold for all @xmath207 .",
    "here , @xmath208 and @xmath209 are the limiting values of @xmath210 as @xmath211 from above and below the real axis , respectively .    inserting ( [ plemelj ] ) into ( [ charkerndef ] ) and collecting the terms yields @xmath212 going back to the integral equation for the singular disk , one has @xmath213 this represents a riemann boundary value problem , asking ( in the special case relevant here ) for two functions @xmath214 and @xmath215 that are analytic on the upper and lower half planes , respectively , and that satisfy @xmath216 for all real @xmath139 .    for reasons that will become clear below , we for the time being demand that @xmath217 has neither zeroes nor poles on the real axis .",
    "comparing ( [ somzerointeq ] ) and ( [ causingd ] ) , one sees that this will be the case exactly when neutral modes are admitted by the disk in question , which strongly suggests that ( [ skernform ] ) has no solution in the regular case of a bounded and nonzero @xmath217 , and at least one solution otherwise . with this concept mind , let us return to the analysis of the boundary value problem , for now keeping our attention on the case of a regular @xmath217 .",
    "the @xmath218 treated here is the restriction of an analytic function ( in particular , by assumption it has no poles on the real axis ) , and thus is guaranteed to be hlder continuous .",
    "furthermore , @xmath218 is a positive real function for real @xmath139 .",
    "this ensures that its index , the increment of its argument over the integration contour , @xmath219 is zero .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath220 is a well - defined ( single - valued ) function",
    ". then one can take the logarithm of both sides of ( [ caupreboo ] ) , to arrive at @xmath221    using the second of the sokhotski - plemelj formulae ( [ plemelj ] ) , it follows that with @xmath222 one can write down a solution to the boundary value problem ( [ caupreboo ] ) @xmath223 provided that the problem does have a solution .",
    "thus one has @xmath224 , and the boundary value problem ( [ caupreboo ] ) can be written as @xmath225 now , the functions @xmath226 by construction have no pole in their respective domains , and therefore @xmath227 have no zeroes . if @xmath228 are defined via an integral as in ( [ caupsifundef ] ) , this implies that they are analytic in their respective half - planes .",
    "thus , the functions on the two sides of ( [ causolbuster ] ) are analytic in their respective half - planes , and they are identical on the real axis . by morera s theorem",
    "this implies that the right - hand side and the left hand side represent the same analytic function , @xmath229 , say .",
    "now , what are the properties of @xmath229 ?",
    "we already pointed out that @xmath229 is analytic on the entire complex plane . at infinity",
    ", one has @xmath230 .",
    "since we require any solution of the original integral equation ( [ skernform ] ) to vanish at infinity , one has @xmath231 as well .",
    "since @xmath232 for large @xmath33 , @xmath233 approaches 0 and @xmath227 tends to 1 .",
    "this implies that @xmath234 vanishes at infinity .",
    "since @xmath234 is an entire function , it follows from liouville s theorem that @xmath234 must be identically zero . by the first sokhotski - plemelj formula one",
    "now has @xmath235 , and hence the homogenous integral equation has no nontrivial solution .",
    "this is a special case of the general result that is proven somewhat more rigorously in the literature cited above : a homogenous cauchy integral equation with an index of zero is unsolvable .",
    "loosening the conditions on @xmath217 , we now allow it to have `` poles '' at some points @xmath236 , which , for the sake of simplicity , are supposed to be poles of order one .",
    "the term `` pole '' has been put in quotes since it is not necessary that @xmath217 is analytic in @xmath237 , only that @xmath238 behaves like @xmath239 at the exceptional points .",
    "writing @xmath240the boundary condition ( [ caupreboo ] ) takes the form @xmath241 where @xmath242 now satisfies the conditions we required of @xmath217 in ( [ caupreboo ] ) . solving the boundary value problem for this @xmath242 and substituting the result back into ( [ cauprebooprime ] ) , the equivalent of ( [ causolbuster ] )",
    "now is @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath233 are again defined by ( [ presolb ] ) and ( [ presola ] ) , except that now @xmath217 is replaced by @xmath242 .",
    "let us again call the analytic function defined in the left and right sides of ( [ causolmaker ] ) @xmath229 .    by the right side of ( [ causolmaker ] ) , @xmath234 now may have poles of order 1 at @xmath236 but still has to vanish at infinity . applying the generalised liouville theorem",
    ", it follows that any solution of the integral equation must be of the form @xmath245 evidently , solutions of this type can not vanish at @xmath86 , since such solutions will at best converge to @xmath246 times a nonzero constant as @xmath247 .",
    "thus , provided that all singularities of @xmath229 are poles , the self - consistent disk admits no growing modes at all .",
    "the obvious explanation for this bizarre absence of growing modes even in very cold disks is that growing modes would introduce scales into the scale - free disk .    stepping back to the mathematics for a moment , the fact that @xmath248 is purely real on the real axis is crucial for that result , since even a minute complex contribution could provide for modes .",
    "for example , adding an @xmath249 to @xmath112 would not change the result that the index ( [ cauindexdef ] ) of the problem ( [ caupreboo ] ) vanishes when @xmath250 for all @xmath139 , so that there still would be no modes above the stability limit of the neutral modes .",
    "below that stability limit , however , the index would be nonzero and the integral equation would admit nontrivial solutions .",
    "such an imaginary contribution would necessitate that the real part of the kernel ( [ skernkdef ] ) shows a singularity on the diagonal .",
    "we can not offer an explanation how this might be linked to the scale - freeness of the disk at this point .",
    "in this paper we have derived an analytic expression for the kernel of the mestel disk . in the cut - out disk",
    ", it reproduces the behaviour described by zang and erii both qualitatively and quantitatively surprisingly well .",
    "it turns out that the expressions for the kernel are quite large in the cut - out case , at least when one uses the classic cut - out functions suggested by zang , so the computational effort involved in finding modes is about as large with our formalism as it is with the older seminumerical scheme . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that with carefully selected cut - out functions , the kernel could be simple enough for further analytic work .",
    "the kernel governing modes in the self - consistent disk is relatively compact .",
    "it allowed us to interpret the stability behaviour of neutral modes in terms of global resonances between the orbital ( which coincides with the frequency of excitation in this case ) and epicyclic frequencies . in the longstanding question of rotating modes",
    "we could establish that no rotating modes can exist above the stability limit of the neutral modes .",
    "it might seem surprising that rotating modes should know about the stability limit of the rotating modes , considering that the ratio of orbital and epicyclic frequency is no longer independent of the radius for rotating modes .",
    "however , due to the lack of a length scale in the mestel disk , any mode is arbitrarily close to a non - rotating one .    even below the stability limit of the neutral modes , no rotating or growing modes exist in the perfectly scale - free disk under reasonable assumptions like continuity of the coefficient function in the expansion of the potential perturbation ( [ potexpansion ] ) .",
    "this bizarre property is probably best explained by an inability of the disk to break its self - similarity and thus by a completely artificial feature . in conclusion , it seems to us that the self - consistent disk s peculiar properties make its investigation something of a pedagogical ( goodman  &  evans @xcite ) exercise , whereas the cut - out disk might yet prove to be a valuable testbed for wave dynamics in a fairly realistic full - disk setting .",
    "part of this work was supported by a grant of the land baden - wrttemberg .",
    "m.  d.  wishes to thank jenny read for virtual but nonetheless useful discussions .",
    "an anonymous referee prompted us to clarify the summary of goodman  &  evans ( @xcite ) ."
