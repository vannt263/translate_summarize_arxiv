    "there are many examples of stable mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) in our solar system .",
    "the three inner galilean moons of jupiter  io , europa , and ganymede  are in pair - wise 2:1 mean motion resonances , and together their orbital motions are locked in the chain of mean motion resonances , 4:2:1 , known as the  laplace resonance \" ; these resonances are stable under tidal evolution  @xcite .",
    "several pairs of moons of saturn are also locked in mmrs , such as mimas and tethys in a 2:1 , enceladus and dione in a 2:1 , and titan and hyperion in a 4:3 mmr ( _ ibid . _ ) .",
    "the jupiter trojans are a large group of asteroids orbiting around jupiter s two stable lagrangian points , l4 and l5 ; these are locked in the 1:1 stable orbital resonances with jupiter @xcite .",
    "pluto is locked in a 2:3 mean motion resonance with neptune ; pluto s perihelion distance of @xmath0 au is less than the semimajor axis of neptune @xmath1 au , so it travels in a neptune - crossing orbit ; but the stable 2:3 mmr with neptune keeps pluto from colliding with neptune @xcite .",
    "many kuiper belt objects are found in the 2:3 mmr and other mmrs with neptune .",
    "planetary mean motion resonances may also exist in exoplanetary systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , unstable mean motion resonances are also of great significance ; for example , the kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are linked to the unstable and chaotic mmrs with jupiter @xcite , and the stability of our planetary system itself is intimately related to the role of mmrs @xcite    the phase space structure near mmrs is quite complex , and there is a considerable literature on their mathematical analysis .",
    "the planetary three body problem , with @xmath2 , is the usual starting point of such studies .",
    "although it does not describe the full complexities of mmrs in the real solar system , it is still a very useful approximation for low - eccentricity and low - inclination planetary systems and provides important insights for the phase space structure of mmrs .",
    "the special case of the circular planar restricted three body problem is particularly important in studies of the dynamics of small bodies in planetary systems .",
    "in this special case , two massive bodies , @xmath3 , move in circular orbits about their center of mass , and a massless third body ( the test particle , @xmath4 ) moves in the massive bodies orbital plane .",
    "this problem admits an integral of the particle s motion , the jacobi integral @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the angular velocity of the massive bodies in their circular orbits and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the specific energy and specific angular momentum of the particle",
    ". theoretical analysis of mmrs , based on perturbation theory , in this special case can be found in @xcite . in particular , we mention the analytical results for the widths of the interior mmrs of jupiter for low to moderate eccentricities of the test particle ( * ? ? ? * sect .  8.8 ) .",
    "semi - analytical perturbative methods have been used to map the widths of stable resonance libration zones for a wider range of eccentricity , for the major exterior mmrs of neptune @xcite ; however , in this case , non - perturbative numerical analysis shows that the semi - analytical results overestimate the stable resonance zones and give poor accuracy at eccentricities exceeding @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , recent observations find that high eccentricity mmrs may not be uncommon in our solar system .",
    "@xcite noted the importance of mmrs in the dynamics of planet - crossing asteroids in the inner solar system .",
    "@xcite noted the surprising existence of high eccentricity , @xmath10 , kuiper belt objects in the exterior 2:5 mmr of neptune . @xcite",
    "suggest that some of the most distant kuiper belt objects ( sedna , 2010 gb174 , 2004 vn112 , 2012 vp113 ) , with eccentricities in excess of @xmath11 , may be locked in interior mmrs with an unseen distant planet .    our goal is to understand how the widths of stable libration zones of mmrs behave at very high eccentricities .",
    "the problem is sufficiently challenging that we limit the present work to only two important cases , the interior 2:1 and 3:2 mmrs in the circular planar restricted three body model .",
    "we use non - perturbative numerical analysis to calculate the resonance widths for test particle eccentricities as large as 0.99 .",
    "the resonance libration regions are visualized in surfaces of section .",
    "contrary to the common expectation that resonance overlap leads to chaos and loss of stable resonant librations at high eccentricities , we report that large new stable libration zones reappear at higher eccentricity , albeit at shifted libration centers .",
    "we report several novel results , including the transitions of the resonance libration centers with increasing eccentricity , the variation of resonance width with eccentricity , and its dependence on the mass ratio @xmath12 .",
    "our results would be of interest in a wide range of astronomical applications of the restricted three body problem .",
    "in the planar circular restricted three body problem , we will refer to the most massive body , of mass @xmath13 , as the  sun \" , and the secondary mass , @xmath14 as the  planet \" , and the third ( massless ) body as the  test particle \" .",
    "all the bodies are restricted to move in a common plane , the @xmath15 plane .",
    "we adopt the natural units for this problem : the unit of length is the orbital separation of @xmath13 and @xmath16 , the unit of time is their orbital period divided by @xmath17 , and the unit of mass is @xmath18 ; with these units the constant of gravitation is unity , and the orbital angular velocity of @xmath13 and @xmath16 about their common center of mass is also unity .",

    "the equations of motion of the test particle can be written as @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the test particle s distances to the sun and the planet , respectively , @xmath26^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath27^{1/2}.\\ ] ] the jacobi constant can be derived from the dynamic equations as @xmath28 which can also be expressed in terms of orbital elements as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are semimajor - axis and eccentricity of the particle s osculating orbit about the sun .",
    "the motion of the test particle takes place in the four - dimensional phase space @xmath32 . with the constraint of the jacobi constant",
    ", the test particle s motion is constrained to a three dimensional surface in this phase space . to visualize the phase space structure in a two - dimensional space , we compute  surfaces of section \" near the mmrs of interest .",
    "a surface of section is analogous to the stroboscopic plot of the phase space variables of a periodically forced nonlinear oscillator @xcite .",
    "our implementation for the two - degrees of freedom of our test particle dynamics is as follows . on a continuous phase space trajectory of the test particle with specified initial conditions ( and with a specified value of the jacobi constant )",
    ", we identify its intersections with the surface of section with the following condition , @xmath33 that is , the phase space trajectory of the particle is represented by the collection of its phase space variables @xmath34 recorded at its pericenter passages .",
    "the phase space structure near the mmr is obtained by computing this representation for many test particles with different initial conditions in the neighborhood of the mmr , but having the same value of the jacobi constant . however , rather than making the usual two - dimensional plots of @xmath35 or @xmath36 , we transform the phase space variables to osculating orbital elements and make plots of the orbital parameters @xmath37 , where @xmath30 is the test particle s semi - major axis and @xmath38 is the angular separation of the planet and the particle at periapsis , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "successive points on the surface of section that are confined to smooth curves in the @xmath37 plane indicate a quasi - periodic stable orbit of the test particle , whereas successive points filling an area in this plane indicate a chaotic orbit",
    ". a closed curve on which @xmath39 changes sign indicates an orbit in resonant libration . the stable resonant zones ( and their widths in semi - major axis )",
    "are then readily visualized in such surfaces of section .",
    "the detailed procedure for producing the surfaces of section is as follows .",
    "first , for a specified initial value of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we calculate the jacobi constant @xmath42 using eq ..",
    "( this first value of @xmath40 is always chosen as the resonant value , @xmath43 , see eq .",
    "[ e : ares ] below . )",
    "next , with a specified initial value of @xmath44 , we calculate the initial position and velocity vectors @xmath45 , @xmath46 of the test particle at pericenter in the rotating frame : @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is calculated with the help of eq .",
    ", @xmath51 with these initial values of the position and velocity vectors , we numerically integrate eq.- to obtain the phase space trajectory of the test particle .",
    "typical integration times run to 60,000 orbital periods of the test particle , equivalent to approximately @xmath52 units of time for 2:1 mmr and @xmath53 units of time for 3:2 mmr . during the integration",
    ", we identify each pericenter passage occurrence ( by testing for the condition eq . ) , and compute the values of @xmath40 and @xmath44 at each pericenter passage , @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath7 is the orbital energy of the test particle , @xmath56 where [ @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the velocity vector in the barycentric inertial frame . for additional trajectories in the same surface of section",
    ", we keep the same value of @xmath42 but use new initial values of and @xmath44 and @xmath40 ( close to @xmath43 ) , and compute @xmath41 according to eq . ; with these , we compute new initial values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we repeat this procedure several times to fill in the surface of section in the mmr neighborhood .",
    "the neighborhood of an mmr is usually identified as a small range of semi major axis near the exact resonant value in which a critical resonant argument can librate .",
    "a @xmath59 mean motion resonance occurs when the test particle completes @xmath60 orbits about the sun while the planet completes @xmath61 orbits , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are mutually prime numbers .",
    "the resonant value of the semi - major axis of the test particle is @xmath62 when the eccentricity @xmath41 is also given , the jacobi constant for an eccentric resonant orbit can be calculated using eq . with @xmath43 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the surfaces of section in the neighborhood of an mmr can be characterized by either their fixed value of the jacobi constant or by the combination @xmath63 . in the following section",
    ", we will label each different surface of section with simply the specific value @xmath41 , since @xmath43 is also fixed for each resonance .    the critical resonant argument ( in the circular planar restricted three body problem )",
    "is defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are mean longitudes of the test particle and the planet , and @xmath67 is the longitude of pericenter of the test particle . in a stable resonance zone , the resonant argument will librate about a central value , either 0 or @xmath68 .",
    "when the test particle is at its pericenter , @xmath69 , then we have @xmath70 we can see that the resonant argument is @xmath60 times the angular element @xmath44 that we defined for the surface of section .    in the present study , we focus on the interior 2:1 and 3:2 mmrs at high eccentricities , @xmath71 , and for values of mass ratio @xmath72 ranging from @xmath73 to @xmath74 . for the phase space structure at very small eccentricities , @xmath75",
    ", we refer the reader to the textbook by @xcite .",
    "a test particle near the 2:1 mmr with the planet has a semi - major axis value close to the resonant value , @xmath76 for an elliptic orbit , the maximum aphelion distance is @xmath77 this means that for large eccentricities , @xmath78 , the test particle s orbit will cross the orbit of the planet .",
    "we generated surfaces of section for initial values of the particle s semi - major axis @xmath40 around the resonant @xmath43 , various initial values of its angular separation from the planet , @xmath38 , and for a range of initial eccentricities .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig : f2 ] for one value of the mass ratio , @xmath79 .",
    "we observe that when the eccentricity is small ( figure [ fig : f2](a ) ) , there are two stable islands in the surface of section , which are centered at @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; the boundaries of these stable islands are smooth and no significant chaotic regions exist . at larger eccentricity , the widths ( measured as the range @xmath82 where @xmath44 librates ) of the stable islands grow ; we observe the presence of chaotic regions near their boundaries , and these chaotic regions expand with increasing eccentricity .",
    "when the eccentricity is larger than a certain critical value , @xmath83 , we observe that new stable islands appear in the surface of section , and the number of the stable islands doubles from two to four ( figure [ fig : f2](b ) ) .",

    "the stable resonance geometry is one in which the planet s angular position is near the abscissa in figure [ fig : f3 ] , i.e. , with @xmath87 or @xmath81 ; in this geometry , the planet s perturbation on the particle is minimized . at larger eccentricity ,",
    "the aphelion of the test particle is closer to the orbit of the planet , so the perturbation of the planet on the test particle also becomes larger .",
    "the chaos regions appear in the surface of section . at eccentricity",
    "larger than @xmath88 , the test particle s orbit is planet - crossing ( its aphelion is larger than the planet s orbital radius ) , and new stable islands appear in the surface of section .",
    "once the aphelion of the test particle s orbit exceeds the orbit radius of the planet , we observe in figure [ fig : f3](b , c , d ) that the two aphelion lobes of the particle s path are cut by the planet s orbit .",
    "this is where the new stable islands appear in the surface of section , i.e , centered at @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the length of the arc of the planet s orbit which is inside the lobe of the test particle s orbit in the rotating frame reflects the range of @xmath44 for the new stable islands . for larger eccentricity , this length of the arc also becomes larger .",
    "so the new stable islands grow and expand at the expense of the old stable islands . for eccentricities near @xmath89 , the new stable islands are of comparable size with the old ones .    in each surface of section that we generated , we measured the resonance width , @xmath82 , defined as the maximum range of @xmath40 about the resonant value , @xmath43 , for which @xmath44 librates about a stable center .",
    "as noted above , this width depends upon both @xmath72 and the test particle eccentricity .",
    "figure [ fig : f4 ] plots the width of the 2:1 mmr for test particle eccentricity in the range @xmath90 to @xmath91 , for three values of @xmath72 .",
