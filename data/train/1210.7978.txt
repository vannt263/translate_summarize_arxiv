    "according to the orbifold symmetry conditions ( [ sym1 ] ) and ( [ sym2 ] ) , the five - dimensional fermion fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be decomposed into kaluza - klein modes ( see @xcite ) as @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 . substituting ( [ subst1 ] ) and ( [ subst2 ] ) into ( [ sact ] ) and integrating over the coordinate @xmath14 of the extra dimension , we arrive at @xmath108\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath109 we see that the mass matrix is nondiagonal . in order to bring it into a diagonal form",

    "we see that the mass terms of the fields @xmath114 have unconventional signs . but with the help of the standard redefinition @xmath115 , we can bring the action of ( [ act4unc ] ) into the standard form of ( [ seff ] ) .    it should be noted that one can find a similar doubling of the number of four - dimensional effective degrees of freedom in the case of one five - dimensional massive fermion in a space - time with one compact extra dimension , where the extra dimension does not possess the orbifold symmetry .",
    "thus , the number of effective four - dimensional degrees of freedom in the case of two five - dimensional fermions in a space - time with a compact extra dimension forming the @xmath116 orbifold  and in the case of a single five - dimensional fermion in a space - time with a compact extra dimension without the orbifold symmetry  is the same ; i.e. , the existence of the orbifold symmetry reduces almost by half the number of kaluza - klein modes coming from each five - dimensional fermion .",
    "suppose the size of the extra dimension is rather large : @xmath117 . in this case , the mass gap between two successive modes takes the form @xmath118 where we have used equation ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "now we can rewrite the first term of ( [ eq14 ] ) as @xmath119 for any fixed cutoff scale @xmath66 , the integral in ( [ sumtoint ] ) is finite .",
    "the larger @xmath63 becomes , the better the integral term in ( [ sumtoint ] ) approximates the initial sum . in the limit @xmath53 ,",
    "the integral itself remains finite , but due to the factor @xmath63 in front of it , the amplitude tends to infinity .",
    "integrals analogous to the one in ( [ sumtoint ] ) are expected to arise in models with infinite extra dimension .",
    "but the origin of the factor @xmath63 in front of the integral in ( [ sumtoint ] ) is not obvious .",
    "below , we will show schematically how it arises in a model with initially infinite extra dimension .",
    "indeed , the existence of a continuous spectrum of excitations in effective four - dimensional theory implies that there is a five - dimensional particle which can move along the extra dimension .",
    "it possesses a momentum @xmath120 along the extra coordinate @xmath14 , varying in the limits @xmath121 , where the upper limit is defined by our choice of the cutoff scale ( of course , in the general case , the particle can move in the opposite direction ; i.e. , we should also take @xmath122 , but it is irrelevant for our analysis ) .",
    "now let us consider the @xmath42 scattering process , but with the five - dimensional particle in the internal lines instead of a set of four - dimensional particles ; see figure  [ fig3 ] .    the corresponding matrix element contains a term of the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a function depending on the momenta of fermions in internal lines in the extra dimension [ for simplicity",
    ", the four - dimensional momenta of particles in external and internal lines of the diagram in figure  [ fig3 ] , together with the corresponding integrals , are included in the definition of the function @xmath124 ] .",
    "note that localized photons do not carry momenta in the extra dimension ; i.e. , we can not say that a localized four - dimensional photon is just a five - dimensional particle with @xmath126  that is why @xmath127 functions in ( [ 5damplitude ] ) contain momenta in the extra dimension only of the five - dimensional fermions . the integrals in ( [ 5damplitude ] ) can be easily evaluated , and we get @xmath128 though the integral on the rhs of ( [ 5damplitude1 ] ) can be finite ( at least after a four - dimensional regularization ) , the value of ( [ 5damplitude1 ] ) is infinite because of the factor @xmath129 . but",
    "@xmath130 ( where @xmath53 ) , which is nothing but the size of the extra dimension . arise when one calculates disconnected diagrams in the standard four - dimensional quantum field theory .",
    "such diagrams make a contribution to the vacuum energy ; this contribution is proportional to @xmath131 ( i.e. , to the three - dimensional volume ) , and thus it is infinite . in our case",
    "the situation is similar  the factor @xmath129 in ( [ 5damplitude1 ] ) stands for a contribution of the _ whole _ extra dimension to the four - dimensional amplitude . ]",

    "<S> it is shown that in the limit of infinite extra dimension , the lowest - order amplitudes of some processes in the resulting four - dimensional effective theory are divergent . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , an attempt was made to construct a model with infinite extra dimension , describing spinor electrodynamics localized on a domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that due to the existence of nonlocalized fermion modes , though with large four - dimensional masses , the regularized amplitude of the standard process of quantum electrodynamics  the light - by - light scattering  is divergent . </S>",
    "<S> this divergence appears to be a `` physical '' one ; i.e. , it can not be removed by means of the standard renormalization procedure . </S>",
    "<S> it simply reflects the fact that an infinite number of fermions , as seen from the four - dimensional point of view , each with the same coupling to the vector field , contribute to the amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to suppose that such divergences can arise in other models with infinite extra dimensions , where the zero mode of the gauge field is supposed to be localized on a brane . to show the origin of the problem in a simple way </S>",
    "<S> , we will consider a toy model which possesses the same property as the one considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it will be shown that an initially local theory with a gauge field localized on a brane can result in the same effects as a theory with a nonlocal interaction between fermions and a gauge field .    in the beginning , let us briefly discuss possible field - theoretical mechanisms of field localization on a brane in a space - time with one infinite extra dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the best - known mechanism for localization of fermions is the rubakov - shaposhnikov mechanism @xcite of fermion localization on a domain wall ( see also its generalizations in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting effective theory contains a localized fermion ( there can be more than one localized mode for an appropriate choice of the parameters ) , whose wave function in the extra dimension falls off exponentially , and modes from the continuous spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> there is a nonzero mass gap between the localized mode and the modes from the continuous spectrum . as for the gauge fields , </S>",
    "<S> there are also certain mechanisms of localization  see , for example , @xcite . to illustrate the key idea of @xcite , let us consider the action for the abelian gauge field of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is some positive function such that @xmath2 for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this function can either be defined by the fields forming a domain wall or just be added to the model `` by hand '' . from the very beginning we can impose the gauge @xmath4 . from the equations of motion , following from ( [ actgloc ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the solution for the lowest mode has the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a constant and @xmath7 satisfies the maxwell equations . by an appropriate choice of the function @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we can always make a nonzero mass gap between the lowest mode and the other kaluza - klein modes ( particular realizations of such a scenario can be found in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the effective width of the function @xmath1 is rather small ( i.e. , it is much smaller than the other characteristic sizes of the model ) , for an appropriate choice of @xmath6 , the action for the lowest mode can be approximated as @xmath8 where @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the interaction of this massless mode with the fermions living in the bulk is defined by the field @xmath5 and looks like a nonlocal interaction , though it originates from a consistent five - dimensional local theory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , any consistent field - theoretical mechanism for gauge field localization should lead to an effective theory similar to the one described above : there should be a lowest localized mode which is massless from the four - dimensional point of view ; its wave function in the extra dimension should be a constant to prevent the universality of charge , which is crucial in non - abelian gauge theories ( see a detailed discussion of this problem in @xcite ) ; and there should be a nonzero mass gap between the lowest localized mode and the modes from the continuous spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> we will be interested in processes involving only the lowest localized mode of the vector field ( say , the photon ) and all the fermion modes . </S>",
    "<S> of course , it is possible to consider the initial five - dimensional theory and to calculate the amplitudes of the corresponding processes in this theory . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , such a calculation can be rather complicated , and it lies beyond the scope of the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> a much simpler way is to put our model into a `` box '' of a finite size in the extra dimension to discretize the modes from the continuous spectra , then calculate the necessary amplitudes and take the limit of an infinite size of the box . </S>",
    "<S> such a procedure also allows one to see how the divergences , which will be discussed below , arise when one passes from a compact extra dimension to an infinite one .    </S>",
    "<S> the reasoning presented above suggests the following toy model in a compact extra dimension . </S>",
    "<S> let us take a model in a five - dimensional space - time with the coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , describing fermions interacting with an abelian gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> the compact extra dimension with the coordinate @xmath12 is supposed to form an orbifold with the points @xmath13 and @xmath14 identified . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we will use the notation @xmath15 for the coordinates @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the brane is supposed to be located at a fixed point of the orbifold  say , at the point @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the total action of the model consists of two terms . </S>",
    "<S> the first term has the form @xmath18 it describes the fermion field @xmath19 living on the brane , which is coupled to the vector field @xmath20 with the coupling constant @xmath21 . in our scenario , a particular mechanism of localization is not taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the second term includes fermions living in the whole five - dimensional space - time . in order to have a nonzero mass term for the zero kaluza - klein fermion mode </S>",
    "<S>  i.e. , to have a nonzero mass gap between the localized fermion and the lowest kaluza - klein mode in the effective four - dimensional action  we introduce two five - dimensional spinor fields ( see , for example , @xcite ) possessing the orbifold symmetry conditions @xmath22 thus , the second term of the total action has the form @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath4 , @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> formally , such a form of the interaction can not be discarded : the total action is invariant under the four - dimensional @xmath28 gauge group and under the four - dimensional lorentz transformations .    </S>",
    "<S> if the five - dimensional coupling constant @xmath29 , then the effective four - dimensional theory is just the standard four - dimensional electrodynamics , and we do not expect any new effects caused by the kaluza - klein modes . </S>",
    "<S> we will proceed with the possibility @xmath30 , which is much more interesting . </S>",
    "<S> we think that the most natural choice for the coupling constant @xmath21 is @xmath31 .    the four - dimensional effective action , coming from ( [ sact ] ) , has the form ( see the detailed derivation in appendix  a ) @xmath32\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 now the total four - dimensional effective action , coming from ( [ sb ] ) and ( [ sact ] ) , has the form @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of course , in a more general theory </S>",
    "<S> there can be massive kaluza - klein modes of the vector field , which can be described by the extra term @xmath35 and the corresponding interactions of the field @xmath36 with the fermion fields in the action of our toy model ( it is clear that the spectrum of kaluza - klein modes of the field @xmath37 does not contain a massless four - dimensional mode ) , but these massive kaluza - klein modes will be irrelevant for our analysis , so we just drop them from our toy model and the corresponding four - dimensional effective action . this is a reasonable assumption  apart from the massive vector kaluza - klein modes , the discretized effective four - dimensional action of a more complicated model presented in @xcite is very similar to ( [ stot ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , though the interaction between the five - dimensional fermions and the gauge field in ( [ sact ] ) looks rather strange because of its nonlocality , such an action indeed can result from a consistent five - dimensional local theory , if we retain only the lowest kaluza - klein mode of the vector field . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the action described by ( [ sb ] ) and ( [ sact ] ) can be considered as a toy model , where a particular mechanism of localization is not taken into account , but the localized theory ( described by @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) `` remembers '' the fact that it originates from a more general five - dimensional theory through the nonlocal interaction described by ( [ sact ] ) ( the fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be considered as the fields describing the nonlocalized fermion part of the initial five - dimensional theory ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in principle , the toy model described by ( [ sb ] ) and ( [ sact ] ) can be constructed using only the general requirements for any field - theoretical mechanism for gauge field localization on the brane , which were mentioned above .    </S>",
    "<S> we also suppose that @xmath40 ; i.e. , the mass gap between the brane localized theory and the kaluza - klein modes is very large . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath41 can be considered as the energy scale at which five - dimensional effects may come into play .    </S>",
    "<S> now we are ready to consider particular effects following from action ( [ stot ] ) . as in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we will be interested in @xmath42 scattering , where @xmath43 stands for the particle corresponding to the vector field @xmath20 ( say , the photon ) . according to action </S>",
    "<S> ( [ stot ] ) , the corresponding amplitude in the lowest order in the coupling constant is schematically represented in figure  [ fig1 ] .    for @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the energy of the photon in the c.m . </S>",
    "<S> frame , the regularized amplitude in the leading order in @xmath46 is given by @xcite @xmath47 where the function @xmath48 depends on the scattering angle @xmath49 and the polarizations of the photons . </S>",
    "<S> we can estimate the series in @xmath50 using the standard maclaurin - cauchy integral test for convergence : @xmath51 thus , amplitude ( [ amplsum ] ) can be estimated as @xmath52 one can see that in the limit @xmath53 , i.e. , when we pass to an infinite extra dimension , the amplitude @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> note that though the mass gaps between the kaluza - klein modes tend to zero in this limit , the mass gap @xmath55 between the brane - localized fermion and the lowest kaluza - klein mode remains intact , and it can be very large . </S>",
    "<S> a divergence of exactly the same type arises in the model discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this `` localization catastrophe '' is the consequence of the fact that , though the vector field is localized on the brane , it interacts with the five - dimensional fermions everywhere in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> such a nonlocality of the interaction leads to a pathology , and it can arise in more realistic scenarios of gauge field localization on the brane .    it should be noted that the use of a finite cutoff scale does not solve the problem . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , let us take a cutoff scale @xmath56 such that we do not take into account kaluza - klein modes with the masses @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of the heaviest kaluza - klein mode , which contributes to the amplitude , can be defined as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 stands for the floor function . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath60 which tends to infinity in the limit @xmath53 for @xmath61 . indeed , in the limit @xmath53 the masses of the modes @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the larger @xmath63 becomes , the greater the number of modes that appear below the cutoff scale @xmath56 , each with the same coupling constant to the gauge field which does not depend on @xmath63 , leading to an amplitude which increases with increasing @xmath63 ( see also appendix  b for additional discussion of this issue ) . </S>",
    "<S> formally , this problem can be solved by considering the cutoff scale such that some constant finite number of the modes @xmath64 is below the cutoff scale for any @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> but in the limit @xmath53 , the corresponding cutoff scale @xmath65 , which is obviously unphysical . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the limit @xmath53 , the discrete spectrum turns into the continuous one without isolated modes , and a fixed @xmath64 in this case means that the contribution from the continuous spectrum is of the measure zero  we just remove the continuous spectrum from the theory and do not estimate its contribution . </S>",
    "<S> so , here and below , we consider @xmath56 such that it does not depend on @xmath63 , and @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> one can expect that effects analogous to the one which was demonstrated above can arise in other processes , such that the corresponding feynaman diagrams contain the field @xmath20 in external lines and the fermion fields in internal lines . </S>",
    "<S> for example , let us take the polarization operator of the field @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding diagrams are presented in figure  [ fig2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the polarization operator has the form @xmath67 it is well known that for @xmath68 the function @xmath69 can be expanded as @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is logarithmically divergent . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous expansion can be made for the contributions of the other kaluza - klein fermions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the leading order in @xmath73 , the regularized contribution to the polarization operator is proportional to @xmath74 in the limit @xmath53 , the sum in ( [ pol ] ) also diverges . </S>",
    "<S> to show it , let us again introduce a cutoff scale @xmath66 . in this case , @xmath75 one can see that ( [ pol1 ] ) indeed is divergent in the limit @xmath53 , so the polarization operator diverges for @xmath76 .    just for a comparison , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a rather different scenario  where the vector field can freely propagate in the bulk . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the action for the vector field can be chosen to be @xmath77 instead of the corresponding brane - localized term in ( [ sb ] ) . here </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath78 with the dimension @xmath79}}$ ] is introduced for convenience  the field @xmath80 in this case has the standard dimension @xmath81}$ ] . from the very </S>",
    "<S> beginning we can impose the gauge @xmath4 . after imposing this gauge , we are left with the residual gauge transformations which are responsible for isolating the physical degrees of freedom of the massless four - dimensional vector field . </S>",
    "<S> we will be interested in the lowest mode of the vector field , so we take the ansatz @xmath82 . substituting it into action ( [ sabulk ] ) , integrating over the coordinate of the extra dimension , and taking into account ( [ seff ] ) and ( [ sb ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath83 where @xmath84 .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us calculate the amplitude corresponding to the process presented in figure  [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it has the form @xmath85 using ( [ estim ] ) we can estimate the amplitude as @xmath86 we see that now in the limit @xmath53 , the amplitude @xmath87 . from the four - dimensional point of view , the only difference between this case and the previous one with the brane - localized gauge field is in the value of the coupling constant ( @xmath88 versus @xmath89 ) . from the physical point of view </S>",
    "<S> the difference is obvious  the second case corresponds to a local theory . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the limit @xmath53 , the zero mode of the gauge field @xmath90 ceases to be a four - dimensional particle  there is no mass gap between the zero mode and the next kaluza - klein mode of the vector field , and between the other kaluza - klein modes . </S>",
    "<S> now all the kaluza - klein modes compose a single five - dimensional particle . in the resulting five - dimensional ( though non - renormalizable in the usual sense ) theory , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding amplitude , of course , is nonzero .    </S>",
    "<S> let us look at this case from another point of view  again by introducing the cutoff scale @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> for the amplitude , we have @xmath91 which tends to zero when @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> again , the larger @xmath63 becomes , the greater the number of modes that appear below the cutoff scale @xmath56 , but now the effective coupling constant @xmath92 of each mode to the gauge field depends on @xmath63 , leading to the amplitude which decreases with increasing @xmath63 .    finally , let us consider the last example  the model of quasilocalization of a gauge field proposed in @xcite ( a particular realization of this mechanism can be found in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the action for the gauge field takes the form ( in our notations ) @xmath93 as in the previous cases , let us put this system into a box in the extra dimension ; i.e. , let us suppose that the extra dimension forms an orbifold with the size @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> again , we can impose the gauge @xmath4 and expand the vector field into kaluza - klein modes . the lowest mode ( which we will be interested in ) of the vector field has a constant wave function in the extra dimension ( which follows from the corresponding equations of motion for the vector field ) , so we can take the ansatz @xmath95 . after substituting it into ( [ quasilocact ] ) , integrating over the coordinate of the extra dimension , and taking into account ( [ sact ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain ( [ stotbulk ] ) , but now with @xmath96 . instead of ( [ bulkcut - off ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we get @xmath97 which also tends to zero when @xmath53 . as in the previous case with the gauge field living in the bulk , in the limit @xmath53 , </S>",
    "<S> the zero mode of the gauge field @xmath90 ceases to be a four - dimensional particle  there is no mass gap between the zero mode and the next kaluza - klein mode of the vector field , and between the other kaluza - klein modes ( this happens because of the existence of the term @xmath98 in ( [ quasilocact ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , we can not isolate the purely four - dimensional massless photon ( a localized zero mode is absent in such a scenario  the photon behaves as a four - dimensional particle at small distances , whereas at large distances it possesses a five - dimensional behavior ; see @xcite for details ) , contrary to the case of the localized gauge field described by equations ( [ sb ] ) and ( [ sact ] ) , where the mass gap between the lowest localized mode and the rest kaluza - klein tower ( which can be taken into account by adding ( [ vect - extra ] ) to ( [ sb ] ) and ( [ sact ] ) ) remains nonzero even in the limit @xmath53 , in full analogy with @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting observation is that ( [ quasilocact ] ) turns into the boson part of ( [ sb ] ) if one takes @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> but the choice @xmath99 means that there is a strong coupling outside the brane in our toy model ( this also follows from the five - dimensional action in ( [ actgloc ] )  the `` coupling constant '' @xmath100 grows with @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that this strong coupling is directly connected to the divergences discussed above .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have considered the simplest case of an abelian gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the localization of such a gauge field on a brane can result in an effective action ( as an example , one can consider the model discussed in @xcite ) analogous to those coming from multidimensional theories containing nonlocal interactions from the very beginning . since one may expect pathologies in theories with nonlocal interactions , analogous pathologies can arise in theories with brane - localized gauge fields in more general cases . </S>",
    "<S> one should take this effect into account when considering brane world models with infinite extra dimensions . </S>"
