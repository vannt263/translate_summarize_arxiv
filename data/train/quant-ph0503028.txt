    "advances in laser cooling of neutral atoms during the last two decades have led to observations of many new phenomena@xcite as well as the development of a variety of atom - optics technologies@xcite .  to study some of these effects , such as quantum tunneling , and studies in quantum chaos , only require that the atoms being studied be cold in one dimension@xcite .  for such studies , cooling atoms in only one dimension should serve the purpose and can prove more efficient than cooling in all three dimensions .  cooling in one dimension has been previously studied in processes such as ` delta kick ' cooling , which compresses the velocity distribution of an atom cloud with magnetic field gradients , paid for with an increase in the spatial distribution , thus conserving phase space density@xcite .",
    "as well , atoms have been cooled to the ground state of a one dimensional optical lattice@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze an efficient and straightforward method to achieve low one dimensional temperatures in neutral atoms through velocity selection .",
    "the technique takes advantage of the fact that in an atom cloud with a gaussian velocity distribution there is a large population near zero velocity along any individual direction .  by utilizing the dipole force to manipulate the motion and spatial position of atoms , a process dependent on the atoms own energies ,",
    "cold atoms can be separated from their high energy counterparts .",
    "manipulation of atoms with the dipole force is a common experimental technique and has been used in several ways such as atom trapping@xcite , reflection of atoms@xcite , quantum state engineering@xcite , and a similar selection of low energy atoms in an optical lattice@xcite .",
    "we show here that this version of velocity selection can not only provide cold samples of atoms at high efficiencies , but even pure 1-d quantum states at high efficiencies when in the ultracold regime of @xmath3 .",
    "experimental studies on this technique were performed in this laboratory in parallel with this theoretical study@xcite .",
    "the proposed velocity selection process is the following : atoms are trapped in a weak quadrupole magnetic trap , while a blue - detuned laser sheet sweeps through the trap .  the repulsive potential due to the blue - detuned laser pushes the colder atoms ( those with less kinetic energy than the laser potential ) away from the more energetic atoms which can classically overcome this potential .",
    "the result is a cold sample of atoms spatially separated from the original atom cloud .",
    "away from the center of the magnetic trap the magnetic potential is approximately separable allowing us to express the combined magnetic and optical potential in one dimension .",
    "( this approximation could be made exact by using a harmonic rather than quadrupole potential . )",
    "a schematic of this is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the combination of the magnetic and dipole potentials results in a potential of @xmath4\\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the atomic magnetic moment , @xmath6 is the spatial gradient of the magnetic trap , @xmath7 is the position of the dipole barrier , @xmath8 is the @xmath0 width of the dipole barrier , and @xmath9 is the peak of the dipole force potential .  to make the above potential conservative , the detuning of the laser from the atom s resonant frequency must be large enough so that photon absorption by the atoms is negligible .  in typical dipole experiments",
    "in which conservative potentials are required , a detuning of @xmath10 is sufficient , where @xmath11 is the natural linewidth of the atom .",
    "this combination of the magnetic and dipole potentials is shown in figure 2 .",
    "note from figure 2b that the well depth is not equal to the height of the dipole potential barrier , @xmath9 , but rather @xmath12 , which is somewhat smaller due to the finite width of the barrier .",
    "after the selection process shown in figure 1 , the selected atoms find themselves in the potential well bounded on one side by the magnetic trap and on the other by the dipole force beam .",
    "the atomic velocity distribution of this selected cloud is a truncated gaussian , with no atoms having energy greater than the depth of the potential well .",
    "it s important to note that when an atom cloud is selected at a temperature we define as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is boltzmann s constant , this does not describe the @xmath0 kinetic energy , but the absolute maximum kinetic energy of the hottest atoms in the sample .",
    "such a truncated distribution is required , in particular , for a planned experiment studying the tunneling of @xmath15 through a relatively macroscopic barrier@xcite .",
    "it must be known for certain that no atoms in the sample have energy greater than the barrier height , or else they could traverse the barrier classically .  in a thermal distribution",
    ", there would always be the possibility of classical traversal by atoms in the high energy tails of the distribution .",
    "similar considerations apply to other experiments , such as proposed studies of quantum potential scattering@xcite .",
    "until the temperature of the atom cloud is in the ultra low regime where quantum effects begin to dominate , the velocity selection process can be largely described by classical physics .  by considering the magnetic and dipole potentials as classical , conservative potentials",
    ", the dependence of the efficiency of the selection process on various parameters can be studied when still in this regime .",
    "we begin with a description of the ` experiment ' and analytic estimates of selection efficiency before presenting the results of the classical simulations .",
    "we start with an atom cloud with gaussian spatial and velocity distributions of @xmath0 radius @xmath16 and @xmath0 velocity @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the initial temperature is @xmath18 .",
    "we model a dipole force beam moving slowly through the atom cloud .",
    "when the dipole beam is moved slowly enough , whether or not an individual atom is swept up by the barrier depends only on whether its total energy is greater than that of the potential created by the barrier .  of principal interest",
    "is how the efficiency of the selection process depends on barrier height for different atom cloud sizes , temperatures , and magnetic field gradients .",
    "three separate regimes occur , in which the dependence of efficiency on barrier height differs drastically .",
    "which regime the experiment is in depends on the ratio of the initial kinetic energy @xmath19 to the variation of magnetic potential energy across the cloud @xmath20 .",
    "the first regime @xmath21 occurs when the @xmath0 radius of the atom cloud is much smaller than the size of the potential well formed by the magnetic gradient and dipole barrier @xmath22 . since the magnetic trap is linear in position , @xmath23 .  when @xmath24 very few atoms are given significant potential energy by the magnetic gradient , as most atoms are always near the minimum of the potential well .",
    "therefore the velocity selection process selects atoms by their kinetic energy only .",
    "the requirement for selection of an atom in this regime is merely @xmath25 , or @xmath26 we define the efficiency of the process to be the ratio of number of atoms selected during the process to the total number of atoms in the cloud . in this regime",
    "this efficiency is given by an error function of the original gaussian velocity distribution @xmath27dv\\label{2}\\ ] ] at low barrier heights , that is , for @xmath28 , this can be approximated by @xmath29 this is the desired regime for the experiment , as the efficiency of the selection process may be high even for large temperature ratios .",
    "for example , atoms as cold as @xmath30 ( similar to temperatures required for future experiments ) could be obtained from an atom cloud at @xmath31 with an efficiency of @xmath32 .",
    "this is to be contrasted with typical efficiencies of @xmath33 for evaporative cooling by a factor of @xmath2 in temperature@xcite    the other extreme occurs when @xmath34 @xmath35 , that is , when the atom cloud size is much greater than the size of the potential well .  in this case , even though the initial atom temperature , @xmath36 , may be much less than the dipole potential height , a significant amount of potential energy is given to many of the atoms by the magnetic gradient .",
    "the requirement for selection of an atom now involves both the kinetic and potential energy of the atom , @xmath37 .  during the selection process",
    ", atoms are being selected by their kinetic energy as well as their potential energy , given by their position in the potential well .",
    "consider the requirement for an atom of zero kinetic energy to be selected .",
    "the atom must be close enough to the well minimum that its energy is less than the well depth ; @xmath38 , or @xmath39 .",
    "for an atom cloud with a gaussian spatial distribution then , the efficiency of selection , in terms of the spatial component only , is another error function integral : @xmath40dx\\label{4}\\ ] ] again , for low barrier heights such that @xmath28 , this can be approximated as @xmath41 .  in conjunction with the square root dependence of efficiency on barrier height",
    "when only the kinetic energy is being considered , the expected efficiency , in the low barrier limit , becomes @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "a dependence of this sort is less desirable than that of equation ( 3 ) , as the efficiency falls off faster than the final temperature .",
    "( note that in evaporative cooling , efficiency is typically roughly linear in temperature . )    in between these two regimes , the efficiency should be approximately linear with barrier height , @xmath44 .  the exact expression for the efficiency in all cases for this description of the selection process is@xmath45\\int_{x_{d}}^{x = x_{c}}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{x^{2}}{2r_{0}^{2}}\\right]dxdv.\\label{5}\\ ] ] note that since , in the general case , the critical position for selection is @xmath46 , this equation is quite convoluted .",
    "this expression has been numerically evaluated for various regimes and gives the same qualitative dependences as the actual classical simulation .",
    "figure 3 shows the results of the simulation for selection efficiency versus barrier height for a very small atom cloud @xmath47 of temperature @xmath48 in a well made of a magnetic gradient of @xmath49 , and a dipole barrier with an @xmath0 radius of @xmath50 . for comparison",
    ", the solid line presents the results of equation ( 3 ) . for these parameters @xmath51 .",
    "the graph definitely shows an @xmath52 dependence of efficiency on barrier height .",
    "as many as @xmath53 of the atoms may be selected at temperatures as low as @xmath54 .",
    "next , shown in figure 4 , is the efficiency versus barrier height for a much larger magnetic gradient of @xmath55 , with the other parameters unchanged .",
    "now @xmath56 .",
    "this shows much lower efficiency because of the spatial dependence now present .",
    "the accompanying solid line shows the @xmath57 dependence suitable for this regime .",
    "note from the condition for the large cloud size limit , @xmath58 , that a larger initial atom cloud size , as opposed to a larger magnetic field , would also create an efficiency of this dependence .",
    "it is at ultra low temperatures that quantum effects start to become evident .",
    "performing simulations using quantum theory allows us to explore these low energy effects not predicted by the classical description . instead of considering a classical gaussian cloud of atoms , we now start with an initial wavefunction @xmath59 given by @xmath60p_{n}^{1/2}(x_{n})e^{i\\phi_{n}}\\label{6}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 $ ] is the weighting due to the overall gaussian distribution of the ensemble , @xmath62 $ ] , and @xmath63 is a random phase .",
    "random phases were given to each component to ensure that there is no phase coherence between individual components , making the initial wavefunction a collection of highly localized energetic atoms .",
    "to make sure this is the case we analyze the initial momentum distribution with a fourier transform and check that it resembles a fairly smooth gaussian distribution of @xmath0 momentum width @xmath64 .",
    "the result is one representation of a thermal cloud of atoms of @xmath0 radius @xmath16 , and initial kinetic energy @xmath65 . for these simulations we use the mass of @xmath15 .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath66 obeys the time dependent schrodinger equation @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the combined magnetic and dipole potential .",
    "the solution to the time dependent schrodinger equation is found by using the split - operator method and evolving the initial wavefunction in time by @xmath70\\psi(x , t)\\ ] ]    @xmath71\\exp\\left[-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\delta tu(x , t)\\right]\\exp\\left[-\\frac{i\\hbar}{4m}\\delta t\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}\\right]\\psi(x , t).\\label{7}\\ ] ]    this equation is evaluated in momentum space .",
    "a fourier transform then yields the final real space wavefunction @xmath72 .",
    "the final result of the velocity selection is then found from @xmath73 to obtain the probability distribution .",
    "because of the random phases between each @xmath74 , @xmath75 can also be written as @xmath76 , making clear the connection of this approach to a more computationally intense density - matrix approach .    shown in figure 5 is a plot of the total probability distribution @xmath77 after selection in a magnetic trap of @xmath78 gradient along with a dipole barrier with a @xmath79 depth and @xmath50 @xmath0 width which , together , make a potential well of @xmath80 .",
    "also shown is the potential , @xmath81 , showing a local minimum at @xmath82 in which selected atoms are trapped .",
    "the original atom cloud has an @xmath0 radius of @xmath83 , while the @xmath0 width of each individual wavepacket , @xmath84 , is @xmath85 , corresponding to a temperature of @xmath86 ( a reasonable starting point after techniques such as delta - kick cooling)@xcite .",
    "the result of the selection is a thermal atom cloud which has expanded in the weak magnetic field due to its kinetic energy . at the local minimum is the selected portion of the wavefunction , representing @xmath87 of the original wavefunction and having a width of @xmath88 .",
    "the energy of the selected atom cloud , @xmath89 , is found by projecting out @xmath89 and calculating the expectation values of its potential and kinetic energy .",
    "potential energy is given by @xmath90dx\\label{9}\\ ] ] where the low point of the well @xmath91 is subtracted so that the result is with respect to the local minimum .  for the kinetic energy , a transform into momentum space , @xmath92 , is made and the expression @xmath93 is evaluated .",
    "the results for the wavepacket shown in figure 5 are a potential energy of @xmath94 and a kinetic energy of @xmath95 .",
    "close to the minimum of the potential well , the shape is very close to a harmonic potential .  if a harmonic approximation is made , one obtains a trap frequency ( for @xmath15 ) of @xmath96 corresponding to a ground state energy of @xmath97 , and first excited state energy of .",
    "while the selected wavefunction shown in figure 5 certainly looks like the ground state of a harmonic oscillator , the difference in potential and kinetic energy in the cloud and its difference in total energy from the expected ground state energy points to some slight anharmonicity in the potential well as well as a slight mixture with the first excited state .    shown in figure 6 is a similar plot with the same atomic - cloud parameters as for figure 5 , but here a larger dipole potential of @xmath99 creates a deeper well of @xmath100 .  the result is a slightly larger selected wavefunction no longer resembling the ground state of the well .",
    "the quantum simulation also yields a prediction for the expected selection efficiencies .  by integrating over the probability distribution for the selected cloud , @xmath101 , the efficiency of selection for the @xmath80 and @xmath102 well depths shown in figures 5 and 6",
    "were found to be @xmath87 and @xmath103 respectively .  by varying the height of the dipole barrier ,",
    "a graph of the efficiency versus well depth may be constructed with the quantum theory for comparison to the classical predictions .",
    "figure 7 shows the dependence of the efficiency on the well depth , @xmath12 for the same parameters as used for figures 5 and 6 but with a varying potential .",
    "also shown , in dashed lines , is the efficiency versus well depth as calculated by the classical simulation for the same parameters .  in the inset",
    "are shown the results of the quantum simulation for very small well depths .",
    "the quantum simulation shows general agreement with the classical simulations .",
    "for low dipole barriers however , the quantum simulation produces an efficiency curve with some step structure , indicating energy gaps for which an increase in barrier height does not show a corresponding efficiency increase .",
    "we have proposed a method of not only achieving ultra - low one dimensional temperatures in samples of atoms , but also of creating specific quantum states and nonthermal mixtures in a potential well .",
    "for very small clouds of @xmath104 a large number ( @xmath105 ) of atoms can be selected with an efficiency which varies as the square root of the final temperature .",
    "this is much more economical than techniques whose efficiency drops linearly with temperature .",
    "the technique also guarantees a maximum energy set by the parameters of the experiment .  this sharp cut - off in the velocity distribution",
    "is useful when performing experiments in which the energy of each atom must be below a certain limit , where a boltzmann distribution would be unsatisfactory .  our theory and",
    "simulations show that there are experimentally accessible parameter regimes where velocity selection can be more efficient in terms of final atom number than existing cooling methods at similar temperatures .",
    "atoms at temperatures of @xmath106 are shown to be in non - classical states , but as higher temperatures are selected , the resultant cloud is increasingly classical .",
