    "in the parton model of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) from a bound state with @xmath1 valence quarks , one encounters two sum rules : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the probability that the quarks of flavor @xmath4 will have momentum fraction @xmath5 .",
    "the first sum rule corresponds to baryon ( or charge ) conservation and the second to the conservation of the momentum fraction . in a previous work@xcite",
    ", we showed , in the context of a covariant model for the bound state , that the first sum rule is a consequence of the normalization condition for the covariant bound state wave function , and hence is automatically satisfied in any covariant model .    in parton models ,",
    "the two relations ( [ eq1 ] ) are usually considered to be independent constraints .",
    "this could pose a problem for covariant descriptions of dis because in this formalism the normalization condition is the only constraint which can be imposed on the covariant wave function .",
    "it is therefore unclear where the additional momentum conservation constraint could come from .",
    "this suggests that either covariant models of dis are inconsistent , or that the two constraints ( [ eq1 ] ) are somehow not independent and in fact are _ both _ a consequence of the normalization condition .",
    "this puzzle provided the initial motivation for this work .",
    "we will return to discussion of this issue in the concluding section .    in the main part of this paper we turn to another question related to the above issue : `` how can we prove , in the context of a covariant treatment of two body bound states , that a static gravitational field couples only to the total mass of the bound state ? '' in the context of a field theory this requires proving that the coupling of a long wave length graviton to a composite system has the same structure as its coupling to an elementary particle , with the mass replaced by the total mass of the bound state . in this paper",
    "we will show , for two simple 1 + 1 dimensional models , that the bound state normalization condition is sufficient to insure that is indeed the case .",
    "these conservation laws are a consequence of the symmetries of the external field with which the system interacts .",
    "for example , the deuteron , which is the bound state of a proton and a neutron , participates in the electromagnetic interaction with a @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the electromagnetic field couples to each of the constituents separately but if the radiation has a large wavelength , it `` sees '' only the total charge . consequently one should be able to compute the total charge of the composite system from the density functions predicted from the bound state model , so one gets a constraint on the bound state .",
    "as is well known , this constraint is identical to the bound state normalization condition .    to see how this comes about in the context of the gravitational interaction ( related to momentum conservation )",
    ", we go back to the first principles and consider the interaction of a composite particle in a gravitational field .",
    "the requirement that the gravitational field couple to the total bound state mass leads to a constraint which at first seems to be different from the the wave function normalization condition , but we prove that they are compatible .",
    "we start in the next section by reviewing the properties of the gravitational interaction with scalar particles and develop the general framework of our approach . then we apply our method to the study of some two - particle bound states in @xmath0 dimensions . in sec .",
    "iii we study bound states of two scalars , and in sec .",
    "iv bound states of a spin @xmath7 fermion and a scalar .",
    "some conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in this section we review the most basic properties of the lowest order graviton - scalar interaction .",
    "after we obtain the feymnan rules of two cubically interacting scalar fields in the environment of a gravitational field , we investigate some feynman diagrams with a single external graviton line to illustrate momentum conservation in some specific cases .",
    "we make use of the gravitational ward - takahashi identity , which we first prove by using our previously obtained feynman rules and prove using a more general field theory argument .",
    "this section is meant to give the general framework of this paper , including the machinery of the bound state - graviton interaction , that will be used in the next sections to derive the constraint imposed on the bound state wave functions by momentum conservation .",
    "consider two interacting scalar fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we will assume @xmath8 is charged and that @xmath9 is a neutral , self conjugate field .",
    "a gravitational `` interaction '' is added if the flat metric tensor @xmath10 $ ] is replaced by an arbitrary metric @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gravitational field .",
    "( note that our metric differs in sign and that @xmath14 differs by a factor of 2 from that used by weinberg@xcite ) .",
    "the four - volume element @xmath15 is also replaced by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the determinant of the _ covariant _ metric tensor @xmath18 .",
    "[ recall that , in curved space , the covariant and contravariant metric tensors are not the same . ]    for simplicity , the @xmath19 interaction is assumed to be a yukawa - type , so the lagrangian reads : @xmath20 the kinetic part of the lagrangian of the scalar fields naturally involves the covariant components of the derivatives of the fields , rather than the contravariant ones . since the fields are scalars , their plain derivatives are therefore identical to their covariant derivatives , and hence for scalar fields the affine connections @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 ) usually needed to convert normal derivatives in covariant derivatives , will play no role .",
