    "was first introduced by assem and skowroski in @xcite in order to classify the iterated tilted algebras of type @xmath2 the gentle algebras are special string algebras which were introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that each indecomposable module over a gentle algebra is either a string module @xmath3 defined by a string @xmath4 , or a band module @xmath5 defined by a band @xmath6 , a vector space @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , we are only concerned about indecomposable modules without self - extensions in this paper , and band modules which always have self - extensions will be neglected .",
    "we first give a sufficient and necessary condition to determine when two string modules do not have extensions .",
    "to do this , we say two strings @xmath9 have extensions from @xmath4 to @xmath10 if @xmath4 and @xmath10 can be connected as a string by an arrow from @xmath4 to @xmath10 , or @xmath10 contains a factor string which is also a substring of @xmath4 or @xmath11 , see precise details in definition [ def - int ] .",

    "a string @xmath4 is said to have self - extensions if there exist extensions from @xmath4 to itself . as a direct application of the above theorem",
    ", we give a characterization of exceptional indecomposable modules over @xmath0 :    let @xmath3 be a string module , then @xmath3 is exceptional if and only if the string @xmath4 does not admit self - extensions .",
    "we give another important application of theorem 1 .",
    "we study gentle algebras @xmath18 , introduced in @xcite , arising from triangulations @xmath19 of an unpunctured surface @xmath20 .",

    "an indecomposable exceptional module @xmath16 is said to be exceptionally determined by its dimension vector if for any indecomposable exceptional module @xmath23 @xmath24 implies @xmath25 we show    let @xmath26 be a curve without self - intersections which is not in @xmath19 , then @xmath27 is exceptionally determined by its dimension vector .",
    "note that to find indecomposable modules uniquely determined ( up to isomorphism ) by their dimension vectors is a classical question in representation theory , see @xcite about the proof of the gabriel theorem , see also recent works @xcite .",
    "different from this classical question , we want to find the indecomposable modules which are exceptionally determined by their dimension vector .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 in theorem 2 might not be determined by its dimension vector which means , there might exist a non - exceptional indecomposable module @xmath23 such that @xmath28 see example [ ex-1 ] .",
    "moreover , theorem 2 also does not hold for all indecomposable exceptional modules , i.e. , there exist two non - isomorphic indecomposable exceptional modules with the same dimension vectors , see remark [ rem ] .",
    "however , the indecomposable modules which are exceptionally determined by their dimension vectors in theorem 2 are related to many important subjects such as cluster algebras , cluster categories ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , these exceptionally determined indecomposable modules together with triangulation @xmath19 correspond to all the generators in the related cluster algebras , also correspond to all the objects without self - extensions in the cluster category @xmath29 of the marked surface @xmath20 without punctures which has been studied in @xcite ( we refer to @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first introduce in section 2 the definition of extensions of two strings and present theorem 1 whose proof will be postponed to section 4 . as an application of theorem 1 , we study , in section 3 , the gentle algebras from unpunctured surfaces and give the proof of theorem 2 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the proof of theoreom 1 .",
