    "a very promising avenue towards scalable quantum information systems is based on photons as information carrier and atomic ensembles as storage and processing units @xcite . while a number of techniques for reliable transfer of quantum information between light and atomic ensembles have been proposed @xcite and in part experimentally realized over the last couple of years @xcite , the implementation of quantum information processing in these systems",
    "remains a challenge .",
    "this is because deterministic logic operations require strong nonlinear couplings between few photons or collective excitations corresponding to stored photons . to achieve these strong couplings , long interaction times and tight spatial confinement of the excitations",
    "are needed . even if long - range interactions between stored photonic qubits are employed as e.g. in the dipole - blockade scheme @xcite tight confinement",
    "is needed to reach sufficiently high fidelities .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss a method that could allow to manipulate the spatial shape of a collective excitation corresponding to a stored light pulse .",
    "it is an extension of the recently demonstrated technique to generate quasi - stationary pulses of light @xcite in electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite using counter - propagating control fields . in @xcite",
    "a light pulse was first stored in a delocalized state of an atomic ensemble by creating and adiabatically rotating the collective atom - light excitation , the so - called dark - state polariton @xcite , from a freely propagating electromagnetic pulse into a stationary zeeman excitation .",
    "the adiabatic rotation , which is accompanied by a decrease of the group velocity , is facilitated by reducing the intensity of the eit control field . in the form of a pure zeeman or spin coherence",
    "the excitation is stored and well protected from the environment for rather long times . at the same time it is however also immobile , thus preventing any manipulation of its spatial shape .",
    "in addition , the absence of any photonic component to the excitation prevents the use of nonlinear optical interactions for making such excitations interact . regenerating a small photonic component of the polariton by means of a weak stationary retrieval field created by two counter - propagating lasers ,",
    "a quasi - stationary pulse of light was created in the experiment of @xcite in a second step . through a mechanism known as pulse - matching @xcite",
    ", the intensity of the regenerated stationary pulse follows the oscillatory profile of the retrieve laser intensity .",
    "this process allows one to create a stationary excitation with a finite photonic component , i.e. , an excitation with stationary , localized electromagnetic energy .",
    "one remarkable consequence of this effect is the possibility to enhance nonlinear optical processes @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of this technique is that despite the fact that the photonic component is at all times very small , the dark - state polariton becomes sufficiently mobile to follow the profile of the retrieval field .",
    "this provides a potential mechanisms to manipulate and control the spatial shape of a polariton while keeping most of its probability weight in well - protected spin coherences .    in the present paper a detailed one - dimensional model of the generation of quasi - stationary pulses of light by counter - propagating lasers",
    "will be presented and its predictions compared to numerical simulations .",
    "it will be shown that in the weak - probe limit the dynamics of the regenerated light pulse is described by a set of coupled normal - mode equations @xcite from which exact expressions for the temporal behavior of the pulse width can be obtained .",
    "it is shown that for sufficiently large values of the optical depth ( od ) , these equations reduce to a simple diffusion equation , with the diffusion coefficient proportional to the group velocity divided by the optical depth .",
    "it is shown furthermore that control fields with spatially varying intensity profiles allow to manipulate the spatial shape of the stationary light pulse . using a frequency comb of retrieve fields",
    ", a very narrow stationary mode profile can be generated by a filtering process .",
    "alternatively using retrieve fields with an intensity difference that varies linearly in space in the region of interest will lead to a stationary field with a gaussian spatial profile and an amplitude exponentially decaying in time .",
    "a linear dependence of the intensity ratio can be obtained e.g. by using paraxial retrieval beams with spatially displaced foci .",
    "finally we demonstrate by numerical examples that moving the laser foci allows to shift and to compress the stationary pulse of light .",
    "although a quantitative estimate of the fidelity of such a compression process is not given here , this shows that stationary pulses of light have a great potential for the manipulation of the spatial shape of stored photons .",
    "let us consider an ensemble of @xmath0-type three - level atoms with one excited level @xmath1 and two lower levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig-1]a the transition @xmath4 of the atoms is coupled to an external drive field of frequency @xmath5 and wavenumber @xmath6 characterized by the rabi - frequency @xmath7 . respectively",
    "the transition @xmath8 is coupled to a weak probe field of center frequency @xmath9 and wavenumber @xmath10 described by @xmath11 .",
    "the excited state @xmath1 decays radiatively with rate @xmath12 .",
    "all other decay and dephasing processes are neglected . under conditions of two - photon resonance ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the resonance frequency of the lower - level transition , the control field creates electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite for the probe field .",
    "associated with this is a reduction of the group velocity @xmath15 of a light pulse within a certain frequency range close to two - photon resonance : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the probe - field coupling strength proportional to the dipole matrix element @xmath18 of the @xmath19 transition , and @xmath20 is the density of atoms .",
    "an adiabatic rotation of @xmath21 from a value close to zero to @xmath22 leads to a slow - down and eventually to a full stop of the probe pulse , which is associated with a transfer of its quantum state to a delocalized collective spin ( zeeman ) excitation .",
    "an adiabatic rotation of the mixing angle from @xmath22 back to zero ( or some other value different from @xmath22 ) at a later time leads to the retrieval of the stored light pulse @xcite which then propagates in the original direction with a group velocity determined by eq.([eq : group - general ] ) .",
    "if for the retrieval a drive beam is used with a different direction , the stored light is emitted into a direction determined by phase - matching @xcite .     by intensity reduction of control field @xmath23 in an eit system ( a ) , and subsequent generation of a stationary light pulse with two counter - propagating components @xmath24 by applying two counter - propagating control fields @xmath25 ( b ) .",
    "the total field distribution of the retrieved light pulse and the control fields is indicated in ( c).,width=340 ]    a very intriguing variant of the retrieval process was suggested and experimentally demonstrated in @xcite . rather than using a single coupling field , two counter - propagating retrieval beams of the same frequency and intensity were used . as indicated in fig.[fig-1]b this leads to the generation of two counter - propagating probe fields @xmath26 which form a quasi - stationary standing wave pattern as indicated in fig.[fig-1]c .",
    "as shown in @xcite the intensity profile of the retrieved field @xmath27 shows an interference pattern which is similar to that of the control field @xmath28 .",
    "the initial envelope of this pattern is identical to the stored light field . due to a process known as pulse matching @xcite , the probe - field envelope tends to approach that of the control fields with increasing time . as a consequence",
    "there is a diffusion - like behavior of the retrieved field envelope . in the following we want to theoretically analyze the underlying physics of this phenomenon within a one - dimensional model",
    "this will then allow us to discuss a number of interesting generalizations .",

    "the above equations suggest the decomposition of the optical coherence in two counter - propagating components @xmath43 . substituting this into ( [ langevin-1 ] ) and ( [ langevin-2 ] ) and making a secular approximation , i.e. collecting terms with the similar oscillatory terms @xmath44 and neglecting fast oscillating contributions @xmath45 , yields @xmath46 in the following we assume @xmath47 .",
    "note , that it is also possible to not make the secular approximation , as is discussed briefly in the appendix .",
    "if the temporal changes of the slowly varying field amplitudes are slow compared to @xmath48 , we can adiabatically eliminate the optical coherence . under these conditions",
    "we find @xmath49 which leads to the effective equation of motion for the spin coherence @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "eqs.([ad - elimin - opt - coh],[ad - elimin - spin ] ) are the main equations for the temporal evolution of the atomic system .",
    "they describe the dynamics of the spin coherence adiabatically followed by the optical coherences .",

    "was assumed .      in order to solve",

    "we ignore the time derivative of the spin coherence @xmath56 altogether .",
    "this approximation is however not sufficient , since it does not capture important effects such as the group velocity and is only valid if the characteristic pulse times are large compared to the travel time through the medium . in order to describe finite group velocities",
    ", the first order correction needs to be taken into account .",
    "this yields @xmath57 where we have disregarded time derivatives of @xmath58 and have introduced the complex parameter @xmath59 . substituting this result into the expression for the optical coherence",
    "@xmath42 and subsequently into the wave equations ( [ maxwell ] ) eventually leads to the coupled field equations @xmath60 these equations can be written in a more transparent form by introducing the mixing angles @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath63 and by assuming a small two - photon detuning , i.e. @xmath64 : @xmath65 and @xmath66 one recognizes that the two field components propagate with an effective group velocity @xmath67 similar to eq.([eq : group - general ] ) .",
    "the first bracket on the right hand side of eqs.([maxwell - e+ ] ) and ( [ maxwell - e- ] ) represents a phase - mismatch , which however vanishes for a two - photon detuning chosen such that @xmath68 if @xmath69 the two - photon detuning is very small and does not lead to a violation of the eit condition . in the retrieval process",
    "the probe field will build up with a center frequency such that the phase - matching condition ( [ phase - matching ] ) is fulfilled .",

    "one recognizes that for almost identical control fields , i.  e.  @xmath78 the group velocity of the sum mode @xmath72 and difference mode @xmath74 are very small due to the @xmath79-term .",
    "it is zero if the strength of the two counter - propagating control beams is exactly the same . if @xmath23 is bigger than @xmath80 the sum mode moves to the @xmath81 direction and vice versa .",
    "finally even if the ratio of the control field envelopes is spatially constant , i.e. if @xmath82 , a small amplitude of the difference mode will be generated out of the sum mode due to the term proportional to @xmath83 until @xmath72 is constant in space .",
    "this coupling will give rise to the slow spatio - temporal evolution discussed in the following sections .",
    "let us first consider the case of two spatially homogeneous control fields with equal intensity , i.e. @xmath84 this can be realized e.g. by two laser beams of the same intensity with a negligible curvature of the phase fronts , i.  e. in the plain wave regime . in this case the propagation equations for the sum and difference mode ( [ maxwell - e - s ] ) and ( [ maxwell - e - d ] ) simplify to @xmath85      let us consider the case where the drive field detuning @xmath86 is chosen such that the probe fields are resonant , i.e. @xmath87 . since for an optically dense medium the phase matching condition ( [ phase - matching ] ) requires only a very small two - photon detuning , this is essentially equivalent to the case of resonant drive fields .",
    "then @xmath88 and eq.([maxwell - ed - homog ] ) shows that the difference normal mode is damped with a rate @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the absorption length of the medium in the absence of eit . for a medium with sufficiently high optical density @xmath91",
    "the absorption length is typically on the mm scale and thus the decay time is on the order of a few picoseconds .",
    "the typical pulse times in light storage experiments are however much larger .",
    "thus an adiabatic elimination of the difference normal mode , i.e. neglecting @xmath92 as compared to @xmath93 , seems justified .",
    "such an elimination leads to @xmath94 making use of this approximation we find for the sum normal mode @xmath72 a simple diffusion equation @xmath95 in the retrieval process two counter - propagating probe field components are created with an initial envelope given by the stored spin excitation .",
    "these components then undergo a diffusion process with a diffusion constant @xmath96 given by the product of group velocity and absorption length .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig-2 ] where false - color images show the two field distributions @xmath97 and @xmath98 for a storage process followed by a partial retrieve with two homogeneous , counter - propagating drive beams of equal amplitude .",
    "the data are obtained from a numerical solution of the wave equation ( [ maxwell ] ) as well as the full set of atomic density matrix equations in secular approximation .",
    "the predicted diffusive behavior is nicely reproduced .",
    "+ 0.5 * 1/3*[1+\\tanh(0.1*(t-300))]$ ] , where @xmath99 . for @xmath100",
    "only the second term was used .",
    "the color code represents the amplitude of the forward ( @xmath101 ) and backward ( @xmath102 ) propagating components of the probe field .",
    "the parameters used for the numerical simulation are : @xmath103 and @xmath104 and the initial width of the gaussian wave - packet was @xmath105.,width=453 ]    in the diffusion process the width of the probe field distribution as well as that of the collective spin excitation ( see eq.([sigmabcadiabaticlimit ] ) ) increase according to @xmath106 associated with this is a decrease of the excitation density .",
    "since in a diffusion process the spatial integral of the field is constant but not the integral of the square of the field , representing the number of photons , there is also a ( non - exponential ) decay of the total number of excitations .",
    "after the control fields are switched on again , the sum mode has a gaussian shape with width @xmath107 , and the total excitation , i.e. in the retrieved fields and the collective spin , evolves according to @xmath108 thus in order to have negligible losses , the time over which a stationary pulse can be maintained is limited by @xmath109 which is exactly the characteristic time for the spread of the initial wave - packet .",
    "if the optical depth of the medium is small , the adiabatic elimination of @xmath74 may be no longer justified .",
    "it is still possible however to find analytic results for the moments of the stationary light field .",
    "first of all one finds from eqs.([maxwell - es - homog ] ) and ( [ maxwell - ed - homog ] ) that like in the diffusion limit discussed above , the integral of @xmath72 is a constant of motion since @xmath110 : @xmath111 assuming an initially symmetric spin excitation around @xmath112 , the width of the retrieved light beam is given by the second moment of the sum mode @xmath113 , which is coupled to the first moment of the difference mode @xmath114 : @xmath115 the solution of these equations can easily be found and reads @xmath116 one recognizes that a small absorption length @xmath90 only affects the short - time evolution . in fig.[fig-3 ] a comparison between the analytical prediction for @xmath117 obtained from eq.([delta - solution ] ) with @xmath118 and a numerical simulation of the maxwell - bloch equations is shown .",
    "apart from a short initial time period , where due to the time dependence of @xmath119 non - adiabatic couplings lead to small deviations , there is a nearly perfect agreement between analytic prediction and numerical simulation .     of the stationary wave - packet of light from eq.([delta - solution ] ) with a numerical simulation of the coupled maxwell - bloch equations .",
    "the data are based on the simulation of fig.[fig-2 ] .",
    "the insert shows the behavior on a larger time scale.,width=340 ]      if the intensities of the counter - propagating retrieve beams are not equal but constant in time and space , one has @xmath120 as a consequence the equation of motion of the sum normal mode attains , after adiabatic elimination of the difference mode , a finite drift term @xmath121 transforming into a moving frame with @xmath122 and @xmath123 leads again to a diffusion equation with a modified diffusion constant @xmath124 .",
    "thus in the case of non equal , but constant drive intensities , the diffusive behavior of the quasi - stationary light is superimposed by a drift motion with a small velocity @xmath125 .",
    "this can be understood in a very intuitive way .",
    "if one of the drive fields is stronger than the other one , raman scattering occurs with higher probability into the probe mode co - propagating with the stronger drive field which causes a drift motion of the quasi - stationary wave - packet .",
    "in this section , we discuss two techniques to manipulate the shape of stationary pulses with the ultimate goal of confining the pulse to very short spatial dimensions . initially the pulse is stored as a spin coherence with a spatial envelope that extends over many wavelengths .",
    "we have seen in the previous sections that the ( partial ) retrieval of the stored light pulse by counter - propagating control fields leads to quasi - stationary pulses of light .",
    "the shape of these stationary pulses is determined by the envelope of the initial spin coherence as well as the control - field envelopes through the mechanism of pulse - matching .",
    "this suggests two different mechanisms to manipulate the shape of the stationary pulse of light . in the first method",
    "the atoms are illuminated by a frequency comb , i.e. with control beams that have multiple frequency components of equal intensity in the forward and backward direction . in this way",
    "many corresponding frequency components are generated for the signal field .",
    "these components interfere to create a very sharp spatial envelope , which is matched to the sharp spatial envelope of the control field , potentially confined over only a few wavelengths ( see fig .",

    "if e.g. @xmath125 would be negative for positive values of @xmath128 and positive for negative values of @xmath128 , the associated drift motion would tend to spatially compress the stationary field .",

    "if the stored light pulse is a gaussian and if the separation of the foci of the two retrieve lasers is chosen such that the width of the stored light pulse is less than the effective oscillator length @xmath201 , only the fundamental mode @xmath202 gets excited in the retrieve process . in this case a spatially constant field distribution is created .",
    "the field has however a finite lifetime determined by the decay rate @xmath203 . as a consequence the total excitation decays in time according to @xmath204 in order to have negligible losses , the time over which the stationary pulse can be maintained",
    "is limited by exactly the same expression as in the diffusion case @xmath205 if the separation of the focal points in the retrieve process is much smaller than @xmath206 the generated stationary light pulse has a much narrower width than the original spin excitation ( @xmath167 ) . in this case a large number of higher - order gauss - hermite modes is excited however ( see eq.([coefficients ] ) ) , which decay much faster than the fundamental mode .",
    "thus as in the case of the frequency comb very narrow spatial distributions of the stationary field can be created , however only through a filter process .",
    "are indicated by the two white lines .",
    "close to the midpoint between these lines the normalized intensity difference @xmath207 varies linearly with @xmath128 .",
    "the generation of fields with constant spatial shape is apparent .",
    "the parameters are that of fig.([fig-2 ] ) .",
    "in addition gaussian beam profiles @xmath208 with @xmath209 have been assumed .",
    "[ fig-4],width=453 ]    in fig.[fig-4 ] a numerical simulation of the the retrieval using two control beams with separated foci is shown .",
    "initially a gaussian probe pulse is stored in a collective spin excitation .",
    "the center of the stored probe pulse is in the middle between the two foci , indicated by the two white lines and the width of the pulse is on the order of @xmath187 .",
    "thus mainly the fundamental mode @xmath202 is excited , which can be seen from the constant spatial shape of the retrieved wave - packet .",
    "we have seen in the last section that the use of retrieve lasers with spatially modulated intensities does allow the generation of stationary light pulses with very narrow spatial shapes .",
    "the underlying process is however a _ filter process _ and thus accompanied either by reduction of the photonic component in the polariton or by large losses .",
    "nevertheless both techniques open interesting possibilities for the _ spatial compression _ of a stored photon with small losses . if a stationary light pulse is created e.g. with separated foci of the drive lasers as explained in the previous section , and the distance between the focal points is reduced as a function of time in an adiabatic way , the spatial width of the stationary pulse follows .",
    "this results in a spatial compression of the probe excitation . as the effective decay rate of a stationary pulse @xmath210 increases with decreasing pulse width ,",
    "the control fields should be switched off immediately after the compression .",
    "[ fig-5 ] shows a numerical example for such a process .",
    "after retrieval of a stored pulse with separated foci , whose position is indicated by white lines , the distance between the focal points is reduced .",
    "one can see very clearly that the field density as well as the density of the spin excitation is substantially increased in this process .",
    "this suggests that by changing the spatial profile of the control field in time , either using the optical comb technique or displaced foci , spatial compression can be achieved .    )",

    "[ fig-5 ]    in fig.[fig-6 ] the temporal evolution of the peak density and the total excitation ( i.e. photon number of the stationary field plus spin excitations in the atomic ensemble ) are shown for the example of fig.[fig-5 ] .",
    "one recognizes that when the peak density increases the total number of excitations starts to decrease very rapidly .",
    "clearly an optimization is needed to maximize fidelity and compression . in order to find optimum conditions and to estimate the maximum possible compression from the theoretical model , it is necessary to include non - adiabatic couplings into the description . finally , it is not clear if spatial compression of this kind can be used to enhance further nonlinear optical processes using the techniques of ref .",

    "in the present paper we have discussed the generation and coherent control of stationary pulses of light by storage of a light pulse in a collective spin excitation via eit and subsequent partial retrieval of this excitation with counter - propagating retrieve lasers .",
    "we have shown that for equal and spatially homogeneous intensities of the forward and backward retrieve beams a quasi - stationary wavepacket of the probe light is generated with an initial envelope given by the spin excitation .",
    "for an optically thick medium the dynamics of the wavepacket is described by a diffusion equation with a diffusion constant given by the product of group velocity and absorption length without eit .",
    "the physical mechanisms for the diffusion of the stationary pulse is the well - known phenomenon of pulse matching of probe and retrieve field components in eit .",
    "we have shown furthermore that spatially modulated retrieve lasers can be used to manipulate the shape of the stationary light pulse and in particular to spatially compress the excitation . making use of a frequency comb for",
    "the retrieve fields a very narrow spatial distribution of the probe field can be generated .",
    "likewise the use of retrieve fields with spatially varying intensity difference can lead to a narrow non - dispersing but exponentially decaying field distribution . in both cases",
    "the narrow field distribution is however created by a filtering process .",
    "thus these techniques can not straightforwardly be applied , e.g. to applications in quantum nonlinear optics . however , as demonstrated with some numerical examples , if the retrieve field distribution is initially matched to the stored spin excitation and its shape is modified in time in an adiabatic way , the stationary light pulse and thus the stored excitation can be spatially compressed .",
    "although we have not analyzed the fidelity of the compression process quantitatively and have not optimized it , the present paper shows the potentials of coherent control of stationary light pulses for quantum nonlinear optics and quantum information processing with photons and atomic ensembles .",

    "in this appendix , we analyze the stationary pulse solutions from the point of view of spatial coherence gratings @xcite , and we show that multiple atomic momentum components can be taken into account .",
    "these arise due to multiple scattering of photons in the forward and backward directions , resulting in distinctly different atomic susceptibilities . for stationary atoms , such as in cold atomic samples ,",
    "these multiple scattering momentum components can be populated and preserve their coherence .",
    "in contrast , for warm atomic vapors , the rapid random motion of the atoms and their collisions results in a very rapid decay of spatial coherences with period equal to or shorter than the optical wavelength .    as discussed in section 2.1 ,",
    "associated with the forward / backward propagating fields are slowly varying optical coherences ( polarization ) with slowly varying envelopes @xmath214 , so that the total polarization can be written as @xmath215 .",
    "similarly , the ground - state spin coherence is defined as @xmath216 . letting the wave - vector mismatch",
    "be @xmath217 , and defining @xmath218 and @xmath219 , the equations of motion for the fields can then be written as          these equations show that the counter - propagating control fields @xmath223 induce a coupling between @xmath224 and @xmath225 , mediated through the spin coherence @xmath226 .",
    "this leads to the formation of new eigenmodes of propagation , where as we show below , there is one mode that is very rapidly decaying while the other decays very weakly in the large optical depth limit .",
    "this phenomenon is analogous to the `` pulse matching '' phenomenon , as first described by harris @xcite .",
    "these equations can be used to obtain the susceptibilities , given by @xmath227 , where @xmath228 .",
    "we now contrast two approaches to compute the susceptibilities , one approach in which the secular approximation is made and one where it is not . writing the polarization as @xmath229 , and the spin wave",
    "be @xmath230 , we have the effective hamiltonian h & = & dz .",
    "the equations of motion for the fields are given by ( _ t+c_z)_+ & = & ikc_+ + ig_1 + ( _ t - c_z)_- & = & ikc_- + ig_-1 , while the atomic equations of motion are _",

    "truncating the decomposition of the polarization at @xmath232 , we can easily show that @xmath233 reproduces our earlier result of section 2.1 , whereas letting @xmath234 leads to a different limit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : multisuscept ] ) .",
    "we thus find that there is a clear difference between the multi - component case and the case when only the zero momentum component of the spin wave contributes .",
    "these two situations correspond e.g. to cold atomic samples vs. hot atomic gases , so that based on the previous considerations we expect that the stationary light pulse will be very different in cold atomic samples .",
    "the susceptibilities obtained in the limit @xmath234 can be shown @xcite to be the same as those found from a coupled mode approach @xcite .",

    "we can compute the susceptibilities @xmath242 .",
    "the result of this calculation is compared to the result of the multiple spatial component approach outlined previously , in fig .",
    "[ fig : multisuscept ] .",
    "implicit in the derivation of the susceptibilities with a coupled mode approach , is the assumption of stationary atoms , so that all intermediate atomic momentum states are taken into account , in particular high spatial frequency coherences contribute to this result .",
    "all spatial components of the spin and polarization waves are taken into account , even those with momentum equal to multiples of the optical wavevector @xmath243 .",
    "for warm atomic samples , these coherences rapidly decohere due to the random motion of the atoms and their collisions .",
    "hence , only for cold atoms , such as those in a bose - einstein condensate , these spatial coherences may play a role and lead to interesting differences with stationary light phenomenon observed in thermal atomic vapors .",
    "finally , we argue that for storage and retrieval of excitations , these large spatial wavevector coherences are mostly irrelevant . as can be seen from [ eq : coupeqn1 ] and [ eq : coupeqn2 ] , the signal field ( in modes @xmath244 ) couples to the polarization components @xmath245 with rabi frequency @xmath246 , which in the `` slow '' light limit is much larger than the control field rabi frequencies @xmath223 . therefore ,",
    "starting from a stored pulse in the zero - momentum spin coherence @xmath247 , most of the amplitude is coupled to the signal field modes @xmath248 , while very little amplitude `` leaks '' to the higher momentum coherences .",
    "thus coupling to higher momentum coherences does not lead to decay of the spin coherence , as discussed in @xcite .",
