    "a fundamental aspect that arises when controlling real plants is that the system must not only be stabilized asymptotically , but must also satisfy a set of constraints at all times .",
    "several schemes have been proposed in the literature to deal with this issue , these approaches can be roughly grouped in two main families .",
    "the first family consists of model predictive control ( mpc ) @xcite schemes . from an industrial viewpoint ,",
    "the adoption of this kind of solution requires to discard existing control laws and to close the loop using a control law based on online optimization .",
    "an alternative solution is to provide an already existing controller , tuned for high performance in close proximity of the reference , with constraint handling capabilities for larger transients .",
    "this second choice , although less performing than mpc solutions , may be attractive for practitioners willing to preserve existing controllers and/or to limit issues related with computational effort , tuning complexity , stability and robustness certification requirements . anti - windup schemes are classical ways to do so .",
    "another way is the use of reference / command governors .",
    "a reference governor is an _ add - on _ scheme which enforces state and control constraints by acting on the reference of an existing closed - loop system .",
    "several reference governors have been proposed in the literature . for a comprehensive discussion on these schemes",
    "please refer to the tutorial survey @xcite .",
    "reference governors for linear systems were first proposed as continuous - time algorithms in @xcite .",
    "later on , reference governors for the discrete - time framework @xcite have emerged due to some implementation advantages .",
    "formulations of reference and command governors have appeared in @xcite .    for what concerns nonlinear systems , approaches using linearized models",
    "have been investigated and used in several real applications , see e.g. @xcite,@xcite .",
    "reference governors explicitly designed for nonlinear discrete time systems have also been proposed , see e.g. @xcite . in @xcite some comparisons of direct nonlinear versus linearization - based schemes are reported .    as pointed out in @xcite , the common feature of the nonlinear schemes",
    "is that the reference is chosen ( implicitly or explicitly ) so that it belongs to a state - dependent admissible set .",
    "this admissible set must be built so as to ensure _ safety _",
    "( i.e. if an admissible reference is held constant , constraints are not violated ) and _ strong returnability _ ( i.e. if an admissible reference is held constant , then after a fixed time the state dependent",
    "admissible set will contain again the reference ) .",
    "a way to implicitly build this kind of set is to make use online predictive simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another approach , introduced in @xcite and @xcite , exploits the use of lyapunov functions .",
    "the main idea of these schemes is to convert state constraints into constraints on the value of the lyapunov function .",
    "then , making use of online optimization , the reference is selected so as to ensure that the one - step state prediction satisfies the bound on the lyapunov function .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose a reference governor for continuous time nonlinear system based on the idea of constraining the lyapunov function .",
    "the main difference w.r.t .",
    "previous approaches is that , rather than manipulating directly the reference , the methods acts on its derivative .",
    "this allows to change the reference using an explicit control law and therefore avoid the use of explicit predictions and optimization procedures .",
    "the properties of this method will be investigated together with a discussion on the computational aspects .",
    "it will be remarked that , in the general case , the main difficulty to overcome is the determination of the bounds for the lyapunov functions .",
    "a general closed form solution will be provided for the highly relevant case of systems subject to polyhedral constraints and whose lyapunov functions can be bounded by a quadratic form .",
    "further specializations to the relevant sub - cases of linear systems and robotic manipulators will be provided , as well .",
    "let @xmath0 describe the closed - loop dynamics of a pre - compensated system , subject to convex constraints @xmath1 it is assumed that the system has been compensated so that @xmath2 is lipschitz and , for any constantly applied reference @xmath3 , the associated steady state @xmath4 is globally asymptotically stable ( gas ) .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath5 is a class @xmath6 function of @xmath7 .",
    "+ the reference governor ( rg ) problem can be defined as follows :    [ problem ] consider the pre - compensated system ( [ system ] ) subject to constraints ( [ constraints ] ) and denote with @xmath8 the desired reference signal ( not known in advance ) .",
    "the rg design problem is that of generating , at each instant @xmath9 , a suitable reference @xmath10 such that :    * its application never leads to constraint violation , i.e. , @xmath11 * @xmath10 approximates @xmath8 as much as possible .",
    "the strategy proposed in this paper is based on the observation that the lyapunov function defines an invariant level set centered on the steady state @xmath12 . to guarantee that the constraints are satisfied",
    ", it is therefore sufficient to manipulate the applied reference in such a way that the lyapunov function remains smaller than a suitable upper bound .",
    "this idea has been introduced for the first time in @xcite,@xcite , where constraints were enforced for discrete time systems by solving at each time step a convex optimization problem . in this paper , a closed - form approach for continuous time systems is presented that acts on the first derivative of the reference and does not require any online optimization .",
