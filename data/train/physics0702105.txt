    "polarization is a fundamental property of electromagnetic fields .",
    "its effects are particularly important when the field s 3-dimensional , vectorial character plays a role , such as radiation from sources , the optical near - field , tightly - focussed beams , and scattering . in these situations , the conventional theory of partial paraxial polarization fails .",
    "there has been recent interest in extending the theory of partial polarization to these nonparaxial situations , particularly the notion of degree of polarization ( e.g. refs . and references therein ) .",
    "the transverse polarization properties of optical beams are well understood.@xcite the theory is based on the hermitian @xmath0 polarization matrix @xmath1 defined @xmath2 with averaging over some ensemble of transverse field vectors @xmath3 this matrix has a unique linear decomposition : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the polarization matrix ( single - point coherence matrix ) of a pure polarization state , @xmath6 is the trace - normalized @xmath0 identity matrix ( completely unpolarized ) , and @xmath7 @xmath8 is the modulus of the difference between the eigenvalues of @xmath1 so @xmath9 when @xmath10 is decomposed via the basis of pauli matrices , the coefficients are the stokes parameters @xmath11 ( @xmath12 since @xmath13 is normalized ) .",
    "the sum of squares @xmath14 on propagation through rotators and retarders ( represented by unitary transformations on @xmath10 ) , the stokes parameters may change , but @xmath8 does not .",
    "the theory of 3-dimensional partially coherent fields is less well developed . even in fully polarized fields ,",
    "the stokes parameter description fails since the plane of the polarization ellipses varies with position .",
    "furthermore , in partially polarized fields , polarization states with ellipses in different planes may be incoherently mixed .",
    "several measures of the 3-dimensional degree of polarization have been proposed and discussed@xcite ; these measures , discussed below , have the property of unitary invariance : they only depend on the eigenvalues of the 3-dimensional polarization matrix @xmath15 by analogy with unitary invariance of @xmath16 in terms of a measure on the eigenvalues , @xmath8 is clearly unique ( up to monotonic transformations , such as squaring ) , since after trace normalization , the two eigenvalues have only one freedom ( their difference ) .",
    "however , for @xmath17 polarization matrices , there are two such freedoms , and there is no unique mathematical definition for the degree of polarization ; it is therefore appropriate to examine measures that emerge naturally out of physical processes , even if desirable mathematical requirements have to be relaxed .",
    "clearly , one such requirement that can not be satisfied in three dimensions is the decomposition of the polarization matrix into purely polarized and purely unpolarized parts;@xcite the intermediate eigenvalue must also play a role in any matrix decomposition ( the largest and smallest eigenvalues corresponding to the completely polarized and unpolarized parts ) .",
    "this is the optical analog of a well - known problem in quantum mechanics , namely the non - uniqueness of the decomposition of a general density matrix.@xcite thus , the definition of the degree of polarization is chosen here to correspond to that of a purity measure in quantum mechanics : a purely polarized state ( with eigenvalues @xmath18 ) always has measure 1 , and the completely unpolarized state ( @xmath19 times the identity matrix ) , isotropic in all directions , has measure 0 ; any other state of polarization has a value in between . for @xmath1 @xmath8",
    "clearly satisfies this , and is effectively unique . however , under this definition , the quantity proposed in ref .",
    "( the difference between the two larger eigenvalues of @xmath20 )  motivated by the eigenvalue decomposition of polarization  is not a purity measure , as anisotropic states of 3-dimensional polarization , which have directional information , are counted as completely unpolarized ( for instance , a completely unpolarized paraxial beam has directional information ( its propagation direction ) , but its eigenvalues are @xmath21 ) . in quantum mechanics and paraxial optics ,",

    "two different 3-dimensional polarization matrices with the same eigenvalues were considered in ref . .",
    "generalizations of those examples are as follows .",

    "the two ensembles thus have different rayleigh - defined degrees of polarization for all @xmath109 by comparison , unitary invariance means the three other measures do not distinguish between the two ensembles , with @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( @xmath86 is approximately linear in @xmath106 but can not be expressed simply ) .",
    "the final example considered here is a geometrically simple case in which the polarization matrix is real and degenerate ( its ellipsoid is axisymmetric and @xmath112 ) , i.e. @xmath113 for @xmath114 in this case , @xmath37 can be found analytically , and @xmath115 and @xmath86 is numerically close .",
    "elements of the polarization matrices @xmath116 are complex when the polarization states in the underlying ensembles have some elliptical or circular polarization ; in @xmath1 this is given by a nonzero value of the third stokes parameter @xmath54 and in @xmath15 by a nonzero net angular momentum vector @xmath117 therefore , unitary invariance implies that states of elliptic polarization are treated equivalently to states of linear polarization .",
    "this is clearly appropriate for paraxially propagating states of polarization , where all polarization states are on the same footing on the poincar sphere , and may be freely transformed to each other by retarders and rotators without changing the degree of polarization .",
    "the situation is less clear in nonparaxial physics , where there are several well - known deviations from the paraxial case , such as the polarization topology of inhomogeneous 3-dimensional fields@xcite , and the geometric phase in twisted optical fibers.@xcite this difference originates in the fact that the 3-dimensional orientation of a state of linear polarization requires two parameters ( the direction of the real @xmath118 vector ) , but the orientation of elliptic polarization requires three ( the euler angles of the polarization ellipse ) . in rayleigh scattering , a ray s polarization is given by the projection of the 3-dimensional polarization matrix into the transverse plane of the ray by eq .",
    "( [ eq : proj ] ) ; complex states of elliptic polarization project over all directions differently than real states of linear polarization , and this is manifest in the lack of unitary invariance in @xmath67 ultimately due to the non - unitarity of the physical mechanism of rayleigh scattering . given the geometric difference between nonparaxial and paraxial polarization , it seems that appealing to analogy with the two - dimensional paraxial case is insufficient motivation by itself for demanding the unitary invariance of the 3-dimensional degree of polarization ; consideration of other physical instances of the 3-dimensional polarization matrix , such as in near - field diffraction , or light in a twisted fiber , may lead to other physically - motivated definitions of the polarization matrix that are , or are not , unitarily invariant .    the definition ( [ eq : pray ] )",
    "can be modified mathematically to give a unitarily invariant version of @xmath67 at the cost of the physical interpretation . instead of averaging over symmetric projections perpendicular to the observation direction @xmath56 one integrates over complex hermitian projections that are orthogonal to all complex vectors ( i.e. all polarization states ) .",
    "this average respects unitary invariance , and @xmath20 can be diagonalized before the average is taken . therefore , under this unitary invariant measure , the partially polarized paraxial ensembles behave like @xmath37 with @xmath119 ( plotted in fig . [",
    "fig : stokes232 ] ) , the examples 1 and 2 both behave like example 1 , and any degenerate @xmath20 as the axisymmetric example .    the geometrical interpretation of the 3-dimensional polarization matrix was used in ref . to describe the polarization of skylight using a canopy atmosphere model .",
    "incident sunlight is rayleigh scattered in a thin layer of fixed height above the plane of the observer , giving rise to @xmath20 independent of position ; the polarization in an observation direction was found using an orthogonal projection of this matrix ( by eq .",
    "( [ eq : proj ] ) ) ; in particular , the neutral points,@xcite where the degree of polarization vanishes , correspond to the maxwell axes of the ellipsoid.@xcite    clearly , the definition of @xmath37 in ( [ eq : pray ] ) is not the only way @xmath58 and @xmath32 can be combined to give a well - defined degree of polarization ; for instance , any positive powers can be used , and @xmath32 need not be included . in particular , the choice @xmath120 in the integrand can be easily integrated , yielding @xmath121/[{\\operatorname{tr}}\\mathbf{m}^2 + 3 ( { \\operatorname{tr}}\\mathbf{m})^2].$ ] the choice of ( [ eq : pray ] ) is made here not only because its definition is physically natural , but also it is closer , at least in the examples considered , to the measures @xmath85 and @xmath122 in quantum mechanics , it is more usual to consider the squares of the purity measures considered in optics ( such as the measures in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fri ] ) and ( [ eq : vne ] ) ) ; the squares are more natural from the point of view of mathematical definition , but do not appear directly ( in two dimensions ) in terms of the elegant decomposition @xmath123    it may be possible to determine the rayleigh degree of polarization directly by experimental measurement . a possible rayleigh scatterer in such an experiment would be a metallic nanoparticle , embedded in some transparent medium ; this would be placed in an appropriate incoherent light field represented by the desired @xmath15 sufficiently constant over the lengthscale of the particle .",
    "it would only be necessary to measure the polarization of @xmath30 over a hemisphere , as the projections in eq .",
    "( [ eq : proj ] ) do not distinguish @xmath124  measuring the polarization over a large number of scattering directions may cause technical problems , and further discussion is outside the scope of the present work . of course , the average over all directions of the scattered ray polarization depends on the kind of scatterer ( anisotropic rayleigh , mie , etc ) ; it is likely that different , scatterer - dependent measures of the degree of polarization can be defined .",
    "these other scatterers have some internal structure , unlike an isotropic rayleigh scatterer , and the rayleigh degree of polarization depends only on the electromagnetic polarization matrix @xmath22    projecting a density matrix on subspaces is reminiscent of gleason s theorem@xcite in quantum mechanics , in which projection assigns weights to 1-dimensional subspaces .",
    "however , averaging such one - dimensional projections ( over all hermitian projections , being quantum mechanical ) only gives the trace ; this construction completely misses the complicated structure of @xmath67 and even its unitary counterpart .",
    "the 3-dimensional polarization matrix is insufficient to describe propagation of partially coherent nonparaxial fields , since propagation direction information is also required ( in the form , for instance , of a wigner function@xcite ) .",
    "it is not clear physically how a 3-dimensional degree of polarization ought to behave under propagation , especially if it is assumed to depend only on the polarization matrix .",
    "mechanisms such as dipole scattering , however , are completely independent of the propagation directions of the electromagnetic fields giving rise to the polarization matrix ( neglecting recoil effects ) , and are therefore a natural place to find physical relevance of measures of the 3-dimensional degree of polarization . however , as has been shown , the natural measure based on this process does not depend only on the eigenvalues of @xmath20 ( it is not a unitary invariant ) , unlike other measures which have been proposed .",
    "the assumptions behind the definition of the 3-dimensional degree of polarization therefore require further consideration .",
