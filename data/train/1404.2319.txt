    "all of the above - mentioned results on periodic frameworks rely , in an essential way , on symmetry - forcing . simply dropping the symmetry requirements for the allowed motions",
    "leads to configuration spaces that are not treatable via the techniques from @xcite . additionally , starting with a rigid periodic framework @xmath16 and relaxing the symmetry constraint to _ any sublattice at all _ produces a framework that is , a priori , non - generic , and so we can not naively apply the results of @xcite to it .",
    "we define a periodic framework @xmath16 to be _ periodically ultrarigid _ ( simply _ ultrarigid _ , for short , since there is no chance of confusion ) if it is rigid and remains so after relaxing the symmetry constraint to _ any _ sublattice .",
