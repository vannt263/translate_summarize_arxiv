    "it is clear from columns 5 - 7 of table[table : plasmonparams ] that these loss processes can not account for the observed damping within @xmath100 m of hole - groove distance .",
    "the constant amplitude beyond @xmath101 m is consistent with a persistant surface wave .",
    "indeed we have recorded measurements ( not presented here ) of the surface wave persisting at least to @xmath102 m slit - groove distance .",
    "it is important to emphasise , however , that @xmath2 and @xmath12 deviate significantly for those expected for a pure spp on a plane silver surface .",
    "interferometry measurements of the surface waves on  output side \" slit - groove structures ( not reported here ) confirm the value of @xmath12 in table [ table : fittable ] , and we believe that conventional , infinite - plane spp theory @xcite is not adequate to explain these results .",
    "we note that persistent surface waves over @xmath103 m distances have also been reported in a double slit experiment@xcite and interpreted as spps@xcite .    as indicated in table [ table : fittable ] , intrinsic phase for the slit - groove and hole - groove structures respectively are @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "although one contribution to these phase shifts may be the cdew  signature \" phase shift of @xmath4 , it is known from earlier studies that the specific form ( width and depth ) of the grooves themselves , can introduce phase shifts into the scattered wave@xcite .",
    "we have determined the nature of these groove - induced phase shifts and resonances by measuring interference fringes arising from surface waves launched on the  output - side \" of slit - groove structures .",
    "these results , that will be reported in a subsequent publication , support the existence of an intrinsic phase shift close to @xmath4 .",
    "the interpretation that emerges from these results is that the subwavelength groove originates persistant , long - range surface waves by a two - step process : ( 1 ) the incoming tm polarised plane wave scatters from the groove and generates in its immediate vicinity on the surface a broad , cdew - like distribution of diffracted evanescent waves , and ( 2 ) this broad - band local surface ",
    "emitter \" excites , within a distance of @xmath54 m , a long - range surface wave response .",
    "the near - term rapid amplitude decrease in the interference fringes of figs.[fig:1stginputsideresults],[fig : hole - grooveresults ] is evidence of this evanescent surface wave diffraction very near the groove .",
    "persistant amplitude out to tens of microns is evidence for some kind of surface wave guided mode .",
    "it is significant to note that the wavelength and phase of the interference fringes do not shift over the entire range of the measurements .",
    "the initial diffracted surface wave components extend over a broad range of evanescent modes , @xmath106 , including the conventional @xmath107 .",
    "therefore it is to be expected that the local surface wave emitter excites this surface mode .",
    "we emphasise , however , that our measurements show that the wavelength of this persistant wave does not correspond to @xmath107 and that , when the phase lag associated the groove itself is taken into account , the intrinsic phase of the surface wave with respect to the directly transmitted wave is close to @xmath4 .",
    "the disaccord between @xmath108 and @xmath2 is for the present a matter of speculation .",
    " leaky waves\"@xcite that transport energy very slowly away from the surface contribute to the spectrum of long - range surface excitation resulting in an effective wavelength shift ; or perhaps , despite our ellipsometry measurements , the surface index of refraction of the metal film is slightly modified by some uncontrolled chemical or material process@xcite . at a more practical level , these results indicate that it might be much easier to couple to surface guided waves than was previously thought .",
    "conventional wisdom asserts that because the spp lies to the right of the  light line \" on the metal surface dispersion curve , a grating or prism is needed to achieve efficient optical coupling @xcite . a simple abrupt discontinuity in the surface , such as a slit or groove , appears to serve as an efficient coupler .",
    "further studies are needed to understand the properties of the generated long - range persistant wave and to optimise the efficiency of this groove - coupling process .",
    "the structures consist of a single subwavelength slit or hole flanked by one subwavelength groove .",
    "the grooves have a width of 100 nm and a nominal depth of 100 nm for the slit - groove structures and 70 nm for the hole - groove structures .",
    "the slit - groove distance ( @xmath37 ) or hole - groove distance ( @xmath42 ) is systematically incremented in the fabrication process . the subwavelength structures are fabricated by focused ion beam ( fib ) milling ( fei nova-600 dual - beam system , ga@xmath109 ions , 30kev ) into a layer of silver evaporated onto flat fused silica microscope slides . a low beam current ( 50pa )",
    "was used in order to achieve surface features defined with a lateral precision on the order of 10 nm and characterised by near - vertical sidewalls and a minimal amount of edge rounding .",
    "since it enables delivery of a variable ion dose to each pixel of the writing field , fib milling conveniently allows the multiple - depth topography characteristic of the present devices to be formed in a single , self - aligned step .",

    "each matrix consists of 63 structures , nine columns , separated by 1.5 mm , and seven rows , separated by 2 mm .",
    "the first column contains only the slit with no flanking grooves .",
    "light transmission through the slits in this column is used to normalise the transmission in the remaining columns .",
    "variations in transmission through each of the elements in the  slits only \" column provide a measure of the uniformity of the fib fabrication process .",
