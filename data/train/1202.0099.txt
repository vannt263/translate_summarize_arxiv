    "the recent development of trapping and cooling techniques enable experimental realizations of low - dimensional ultracold atomic and molecular gases in optical lattices . in particular , by the magnetic feshbach resonance or confinement - induced resonance methods ,",
    "the low - dimension particles can be adjusted continually from strong repulsive to attractive interaction .",
    "it is therefore possible to realize strongly correlated low - dimensional quantum systems experimentally @xcite .    for the weakly repulsive regime in one dimension ( 1d ) , the degenerate bose gas acts as a quasi bose einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "as the strength of the repulsive interaction tends to infinity , the bosons behave like impenetrable fermions and the system is known as the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas physrev.50.955 , jmp.1.516 . on the contrary , for the strongly attractive regime , the 1d bose gas is more strongly correlated than the tg gas and can be stable in a wide range of strongly attractive interaction strength , and thus called it as the super tonks - girardeau gas ( stg ) phase @xcite .",
    "the stg gas - like state corresponds to a highly excited states and have no analog in solid - state systems .",
    "they can be realized by a sudden quench the effective 1d interaction from the strongly repulsive to the strongly attractive interaction regime by adjusting the magnetism field .",
    "the tg gas - like state can transfer into the stg gaslike phase which are hard to realize in traditional condensed - matter physics haller04092009 , physreva.81.031609 , physreva.83.053632 .",
    "the existence of these stable gas - like states against cluster - like states due to the existence of large fermi - pressure - like kinetic energy inheriting from the strongly repulsive interaction .",
    "understanding the dynamic properties of the new synthetic bosonic gas phase is an important subject .",
    "as is well known , the mean - field theory typically does not work well for a 1d system , except in the very weakly interacting regime .",
    "the enhanced quantum fluctuation is significant in 1d quantum systems physrev.130.1605 , physrevlett.85.3745 , physrevlett.86.5413 , physreva.68.063605 which exhibit fascinating phenomena significantly different from their three - dimensional counterparts .",
    "thus when the interaction is strong , non - perturbative methods such as the bose - fermi mapping @xcite or the bethe ansatz physrevlett.20.98 , 0295 - 5075 - 61 - 3 - 368 needs to be used to characterize the features of the system properly . in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath0 and @xmath1 remains finite , the energy density and chemical potential of bose gas in tg and stg phase have been extracted from the bethe - ansatz solution in the absence of the external potential @xcite . with the local - density approximation ( lda ) , a modified nonlinear schrdinger equation is obtained . using this kind of nonlinear schrdinger equation , it is possible to investigate further the dynamic properties of bose gas in strong interactive regimes .",
    "associated with the periodicity and nonlinearity , there exist two important waves in nonlinear periodical systems , namely bloch waves and gap solitons ( gss ) .",
    "bloch waves , which exist in both linear and nonlinear periodic systems , are extensive and spread over the whole space @xcite . on the contrary , gss , which are spatially localized atomic wave packets , exist only in a nonlinear periodic system @xcite .",
    "in particular , a class of solitons called the fundamental gap solitons , have the major peak well localized within a unit cell @xcite .",
    "the solitons with two peaks of opposite signs within a unit cell are called the subfundamental gap solitons @xcite .",
    "the existence and stability of gss are important issues .",
    "the relationship between the gss and the nonlinear bloch waves ( nlbws ) is also a topic of considerable interest .",
    "we have studied the gss and nlbws of interacting bosons in one - dimensional optical lattices , taking into account the repulsive interaction from the weak to the strong limits @xcite .",
    "the composition relation between the gss and nlbws was verified numerically to exist for the whole span of the interaction strength .",
    "the stable gss was found to form easily in a weakly interacting system with energies near the bottom of the lower - level linear bloch band gaps .",
    "the present issues are whether the stable gss can exist in the stable stg phase , and whether the composition relation remains valid ?",
    "to what extent the gss and nlbws change when the interaction changes from repulsive to attractive case ?    in this paper , we attempt to investigate the gss and nlbws of the so - called stg gas in a 1d optical lattices .",
    "we are interested particularly in its existences and stability .",
    "it will be shown that the amplitude of periodical potential and nonlinear interactions are two important factors for the stability of gss .",
    "the linear stability analysis indicates that stable gap soliton waves is easy to form near the bottoms of the linear bloch band gaps .",
    "the composition relation remains valid in stg phase .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model equation ] , we introduce the model equation for a 1d periodic bose system in stg phase , and then present the gaussian - like bose density profile @xmath2 within a unit cell and chemical potential for different interaction constant @xmath3 in order to understand the special bose system from an alternating perspective . in sec .

    "[ reduced_nse ] and fig .",
    "the existence of large effective ( or equivalent ) repulsive interaction is , in fact , due to the existence of large kinetic energy inheriting from the strongly repulsive interaction .",

[ fig2 ] .",
    "a large @xmath49 is used in our calculations due to the large nonlinear interaction of bose gas in stg phase .",

    "the high - order nlbb develops analogously from the high - order lbb and is lifted with the increase of @xmath11 .",

    ", the nlbb is seen to correspond to less @xmath11 for the same @xmath38 , as compared to those of the @xmath53 case .",
    "this is because a large nonlinear interactions correspond to the smaller interaction constant case , one doesnt needs a larger @xmath11 to achieve the same nonlinear effect .",
    ".,width=321 ]    as shown previously , nlbb can be viewed as the lifted lbb by increasing the nonlinear interaction . while lbb can be viewed as the evolution from the discrete energy levels of an individual well @xcite .",
    "therefore it is not difficult to think that nlbw belonging to the @xmath54th nlbb should have @xmath54-@xmath55 nodes ( in the sense of the @xmath54th bound state ) in an individual well of the periodic potential .",

    "as we know , the bright solitons form for atomic matter waves when the linear spreading due to kinetic energy is compensated by the attractive interaction between atoms .",
    "similarly , the existence of gss is due to that the linear spreading and repulsive atom - atom interaction are compensated by the confinement of periodical potential .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the effect of the nonlinear and periodical potential on the gs stability . following the standard procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite , we first add a small perturbation @xmath58 to a known solution @xmath59 , and then insert the perturbation into eq .",
    "( [ reduced_nse ] ) .",

    "[ fig4 ] for different amplitude of periodical potential @xmath36 and @xmath62 .",
    "it indicates that the first family gss which develop from the first lbb are stable when their chemical potentials @xmath38 are near the bottom of the first lbb gap .",
    "they will become unstable when @xmath38 becomes higher within the first band gap ( with the increase of @xmath11 ) , and enters into the second and third band gaps ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the second and high family gss are also stable when the chemical potentials are near the bottom of the corresponding band gap .",
    "the above behaviors are very similar to the repulsive case .",
    "this is due to the little particle number contained in gss ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) while the gss develop from the bottoms of band gaps .",
    "in such case , the particles behavior is similar to the non - interaction particles in a single potential well . in such case ,",
    "the gss are , in fact , the stationary states in discrete energy levels and therefore stable .",
    "when increasing the particle number , the interaction between particle will increase .",
    "if the interaction energy can not be compensated by the confinement potential energy when the confinement potential remains unchanged , the gss will become unstable .",
    "seen also from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the wave functions of high - order family gs have more nodes .",
    "it is therefore that the kinetic energy of gs is larger in high - order family than that of in low - order family . from the above analysis",
    ", it also indicates the interaction is the main factors to govern the gs satiability .     for different family gss .",
    "the chemical potentials @xmath63 are taken @xmath64 ( blue solid line marked with square ) and @xmath65 ( black dashdot line marked with circle ) times band gap width away from the bottom bands respectively .",
    "the other parameters are the same as that used in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a).,width=264 ]    it is interesting to see that the first family gss are stabile only in a narrow regimes near the bottom of the first bang gap . this regime becomes wide for high family gss .",
    "see the length of red arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the particle number contained in gss are equal approximately in the center of band gaps . if judging the gs stability according to the general intuition , the high family gss should be unstable due to large kinetic energy .",
    "in order to understand the gs stability in different family quantitatively , we multiply @xmath59 in the left side of eq .",
    "[ reduced_nse ] and integrate in whole space to obtain the kinetic energy @xmath66 and interaction energy between atom @xmath67 .",

    "the number results of @xmath69 are presented in fig .",
    "the chemical potentials @xmath38 are taken @xmath70 and @xmath65 times width of the band gap away from the bottom bands respectively .",
    "it is clearly that the repulsive interaction of high family gss becomes weak relative to the the kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , even though with the same particle number , the low - order family gss are tend to unstable and the high - order family gss is expected to be stale however .      comparing the linear stability analysis presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , the fourth family gss are only unstable in a narrow regime near the top of band gap when @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) )",
    ". however , the gss are all stable in the entire regime of the fourth band gap when @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the increasing of stable regime seems not to be obvious for low - order family gss when increasing the amplitude of periodical potential .",
    "when increasing periodical potential , the unstable gss will become stable gss since the confinement of periodical potential is enough to compensate the linear spreading and repulsive atom - atom interaction .",
    "so the stable regime near the bottom of band gap will become wide in such as case . as the above discussions , the effect of nonlinear interaction for high - order family gss are weaker than that of low - order family gss .",
    "it results the variations of the stable regime is obvious for high - order family gss when increasing the periodical potential .",
    "we have also studied the stability of bose near tg phase numerically .",
    "the above behaviors are still right ( not present here ) .",
    "as shown previously , the different family gss originate from the stable bound state of single periodical well and develop in the band gaps . on the other hand",
    ", nlbb can be viewed as the lifted lbb by increasing the nonlinear interaction .",
    "however , lbb can be viewed as the evolution from the discrete energy levels of an individual well .",
    "therefore gss and nlbws should have some similarity .",
    "it has shown that gss and nlbws belonging to the @xmath54th nlbb have @xmath54-@xmath55 nodes in an individual well of the periodic potential .",
    "in particular , it has also pointed out and proven numerically in the whole interaction regime that gss are the building blocks of the nlbws zhang1 , physreva.83.043610 .",
    "the current issue is whether the above statements remain correct when the nonlinear term is replaced by the case of bose atoms in the stg phase .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we have plotted both nlbw ( blue dashed line ) and gss ( red solid line ) for bose in stg phase ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "an almost perfect ( unnoticeable ) match is found between the nlbw and the gs within one unit cell .",
    "the good match occurs regardless of the first family or the high family gss .",
    "it thus gives a strong evidence that gss can be considered as the building blocks of the nlbws .",
    "it is important to note that the waves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a)&(b ) are belonging to the first - family gs and hence of no node . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c)&(d ) however , gs belong to the second - family and hence of one node .",
    "the good matches are also found between the nlbw and the gs of high - order family in fig .",
    "[ fig3](e)&(f ) and ( g)&(h ) where multiply notes exist within one unit cell .     and",
    "the periodic potential strength is @xmath41 for all panels.,width=321 ]    in addition to the gss and nlbws studied previously , there are two other types of waves which are also common in a nonlinear system .",
    "one is called the high - order gss which are gs waves of multiple peaks over multiple unit cells @xcite .",
    "another is called the multiple periodic waves which are defined as @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath54 being a positive integer @xcite . in the repulsive atom interaction",
    ", it has been shown that composition relation between the gss and the nlbws can be generalized to construct multiple periodic waves from the high - order gss @xcite .",
    "the present issue is again to see whether the generalized composition relation remains valid in the present case of bose gas in stg phase .",
    "we have first solved the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( reduced_nse ) numerically using the imaginary - time method with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the nlbw function @xmath59 and chemical potential @xmath74 are obtained accurately with a given interaction constant @xmath53 .",
    "the newton - relaxation method is then used to solve the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ reduced_nse ] ) to obtain high - order gss with the pre - obtained @xmath75 as done in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with the proper guess wave function .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) show the four - peak high - order gss ( two center peaks up , two adjacent peaks down ) .",
    "an almost perfect match is found between the high - order gss and the nlbws except the phase of wave function in some single well .",
    "thus high - order gss can also be viewed as the truncated nlbws in the whole interaction regimes .",
    "the newton - relaxation method is further used to solve the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ reduced_nse ] ) to obtain the multiple periodic waves in fig .",

    "in particular , we presents twenty - peak periodic waves in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( e ) .",
    "the best matches between gss and high - order gss , as well as multiple periodic waves and nlbws , strong support that the gss are the basic entity and the other waves can built by them .",
    "the above conclusions are useful to obtain nlbws and multiple periodic waves of nonlinear schrdinger equation . in actual numerical calculation",
    ", we can first solve the nonlinear schrdinger equation to obtain gss of different family , and then build an initial wave function with the gs . if we want to obtain @xmath54-periodic waves in @xmath76-periodic potential well , the initial guess wave function can be built by @xmath54-gss as a block ( @xmath77 is assumed to be a integer ) . if we want to obtain nlbws in @xmath76-periodic potential well , the initial guess wave function can be built by @xmath76-gss arrangement one by one . with the initial wave function , the newton - relaxation method is again used to solve the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ reduced_nse ] ) to obtain gss and multiple periodic waves accurately .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the initial wave function is very close to the finial wave function .",
    "the iteration times decrease obviously .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the gss of 1d periodic bosonic gas in stg phase .",
    "the main focus is to consider its stabilities . by the linear stability analysis",
    ", it is found that the periodic potential and the nonlinear interactions are important to the stabilities of gss . increasing the amplitude of periodic potential or decreasing the nonlinear interactions , the unstable gss can turn into stable .",
