    "we have constructed superconducting phase diagrams in figure 5 that relate the critical temperatures @xmath3 to the lattice constants compiled from the squid data and diffraction results from all the samples .",
    "the lattice parameters of the tetragonal unit cell found at room temperature were used as the x - axis versus @xmath3 in the phase diagrams .",

    "the corresponding superconducting volume fractions ( 4@xmath46@xmath47 ) were also established by squid magnetometry ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we found that @xmath3 and its volume fraction increased with the lattice constant @xmath48 and decreased with lattice constant @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , those with the highest tetragonality gave the maximum @xmath3 and superconducting volume fractions . for samples to exhibit significant superconducting volume fractions ( 4@xmath46@xmath47 @xmath50 10 % ) , the lattice constant @xmath48 must be larger than about 9.20   and @xmath49 smaller than about 3.80  .",
    "these trends in the lattice parameters are consistent with the findings of sun @xmath51 @xmath52 . on their hydroxide analogues,@xmath16 where they attribute a large a lattice constant to iron vacancies in the fese layers and therefore iron slightly oxidized above 2 + .",

    "as table 1 shows , when the occupancy of the fe2 site falls from near full to 91.9(2 ) % , superconductivity is lost .",
    "the differences overall between the hydroxide samples prepared by powder routes and the single crystal ones could be due the accommodation of iron vacancies during the syntheses . as sun @xmath53 t @xmath52 .",
    "found in their samples,@xmath40 when fese in its tetragonal @xmath31-phase is used as the host for intercalation via hydrothermal synthesis , iron powder is necessary in order to fill in the resulting vacancies .",
    "when we start with fe powder and selenourea as the se source , this leads to more variability in the amount of iron vacancies and therefore a larger spread in the tetragonality parameter that can express superconductivity ( figure 5 ) .",
    "our powder method therefore would lead to the in - situ growth of alternating fese and li@xmath1fe@xmath2od layers rather than post - synthetic modification ( also known as soft chemistry ) of fese layers as done in our single crystal method .      to verify whether any of the samples exhibit antiferromagnetism , we searched for any superlattice peaks in the npd patterns that could arise below 120 k , the afm transition in the parent phase of ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2od)fese reported by dong @xmath51 @xmath52.@xmath4 no superlattice reflections were observed in the bt-1 high - resolution npd patterns , and our deuterated samples allowed for a low background in case of a small fe signal .",
    "indeed , in the arsenide systems the iron moment can be small in the parent phases such as 0.36(5 ) @xmath54@xmath55/fe in laofeas30 and 0.25(7 ) @xmath54@xmath55/fe in ndofeas,@xmath56 any hydrogen incoherent background would easily overwhelm such a small signal from long - range magnetic ordering in the npd .",
    "the samples were measured up to 50 k on bt-1 , and no long range magnetic ordering was observed .",
    "npd patterns measured with a psd on bt-7 , which has a much higher flux than bt-1 at low angles , also revealed no antiferromagnetic peaks in the non - superconducting samples ( figure 6 ) .",
    "difference patterns between 150 k and 4 k are shown in figure 6 , revealing no residual intensity and only differences arising from thermal expansion and thus peak positions .",
    "in preparing our deuteroxide samples , we found the reaction temperature to influence the lattice constants . mild hydrothermal reaction temperatures ( 120 @xmath25c ) led to samples expressing a higher @xmath3 , while the reaction temperature above 180 @xmath25c led exclusively to either non - superconducting samples or ones with very low volume fractions ( 4@xmath46@xmath47@xmath571% ) .",
    "reaction times also affected the lattice constants .",
    "longer reaction times ( @xmath503 days ) yielded samples with slightly larger @xmath49 and smaller @xmath48 ( i.e. smaller tetragonality parameters ) .",
    "while all the deuterated samples followed the trend shown in the phase diagram ( figure 5 ) , similarly prepared hydrated samples deviated in their behaviour .",
    "indeed , some hydroxide samples with lattice parameters matching those in the phase diagram from earlier literature1 did not exhibit superconductivity ( figure 4a ) .",
    "interestingly , samples prepared at lower temperatures with the described mixing ratio and longer reaction times expressed coexistence between superconductivity and ferromagnetism ( figure 3 ) .",
    "thus , while longer reaction times above 180 @xmath25c led to lower @xmath3 s or non - superconducting samples , longer reaction times at lower temperatures ( 120 @xmath25c ) produced the ferromagnetic signal in superconducting ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2od)fese .",
    "as described in the next section , this might be a kinetic effect from the increasing amount of oxidized iron in water from longer reaction times .",
    "in several of our non - superconducting samples , we have observed an antiferromagnetic transition close to 120 k. dong et al .",
    "have claimed that the hydroxide samples in the non - superconducting dome were antiferromagnetic parent phases with a @xmath58 close to 120 k , and therefore that the selenides and arsenides have the same underlying physics with respect to the superconducting mechanism .",
    "this is a very important claim that could have large implications in the field of iron - based superconductors .",
    "none of our non - superconducting deuteroxide samples , however , exhibited this antiferromagnetic signal in the squid measurements , which led us to believe that the antiferromagnetism may not be intrinsic to this system .",
    "li@xmath1fexod)fese at 150 k and ( b ) 4 k. the difference between the two patterns in ( c ) reveals no antiferromagnetic peaks . ]    our findings in the preparation of hydroxide and deuteroxide samples revealed the strong possibility that the 120 k transition observed in the squid magnetization measurements arise from iron oxide impurities .",
    "the so - called verwey transition , which corresponds to a fe@xmath33/fe@xmath59 charge ordering transition in fe@xmath5o@xmath6 also occurs near 120 k.@xmath60 furthermore , structurally related li@xmath2feo@xmath7 phases can express @xmath58 from 100 k to 300 k according to amount of intercalated lithium cations.@xmath61    in order to study the formation of iron oxide impurities , a sample was prepared under similar hydrothermal conditions but without the addition of selenourea .",
    "as pointed out by sun @xmath51 @xmath52 . in their extensive study of the formation of ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2oh)fese ,",
    "the strongly basic conditions ( ph @xmath50 14 ) of the synthesis strongly favors the formation of fe@xmath59 species according the electrochemical - ph phase equilibrium diagram ( i.e. pourbaix ) of iron.@xmath62 therefore , without the selenourea reagant to stabilize divalent iron , a large amount of mixed valent iron oxides are produced from hydrothermal synthesis containing large amounts of lioh ( or liod ) .",
    "o@xmath6 prepared under similar hydrothermal conditions to that of ( li@xmath1fe@xmath38oh)fese in the absence of selenourea .",

    "( d ) the corresponding magnetization data of this non - superconducting ( li@xmath1fe@xmath38oh)fese sample , exhibiting the 125 k transition similar to that of fe@xmath33/fe@xmath59 charge ordering seen in fe@xmath5o@xmath6 ( inset ) . ]    the xrd pattern of the as - recovered sample from hydrothermal synthesis without selenourea was fitted to the fe@xmath5o@xmath6 structure , and its magnetic susceptibility measurement was in very good agreement with typical verwey transition at 120 k ( figure 7 ) .",
    "as shown in figure 7b , a hydroxide sample with lattice constants in the supposed superconducting region showed no superconductivity , but a transition similar to charge ordering in fe@xmath5o@xmath6 .",
    "peaks in the xrd pattern ( indicated by * in figure 7b ) that can not be matched with the ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2oh)fese phase was indexed well with the strongest peaks of fe@xmath5o@xmath6 . in addition , our synchrotron xrd data for a non - superconducting ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2oh)fese single crystal sample revealed small amounts of fe@xmath5o@xmath6 impurity ( figure s2 ) , which was not observed by laboratory x - ray measurements .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the 120 k transition in non - superconducting ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2oh)fese samples is extrinsic and due to magnetic impurities fe@xmath5o@xmath6 or structurally related li@xmath2feo@xmath7 , which would modulate the ordering temperature .",
    "hydrothermal synthesis of samples with d@xmath7o under similar conditions as those with h@xmath7o did not lead to appreciable oxide impurity .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observed differences in the acid - base chemistry of h@xmath7o and d@xmath7o lead to different products for similar reaction conditions .",
    "indeed , a hydrothermal treatment of iron powder with d@xmath7o and with liod did not lead to complete conversion to fe@xmath5o@xmath6 but left unreacted iron powder ( approximately 50% ) .",
    "since under highly basic conditions , fe@xmath63 should be favoured thermodynamically , we believe the kinetics for the oxidation of iron with d@xmath7o is slower than in h@xmath7o . the autoionization constant of d@xmath7o is smaller than that of h@xmath7o due to the stronger d  o bond than the h  o bond .    all deuteroxide single crystal samples prepared in d@xmath7o showed noticeable higher @xmath3 s than their hydroxide counterparts prepared at identical conditions ( table s2 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 of hydroxide samples can be improved by reducing the reaction time ( i.e. 37 k vs. 32 k for 2 d and 4 d , respectively at 120 @xmath25c ) .",
    "it is likely that a shorter reaction time reduced the extent of fe oxidation .",
    "interestingly , both ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2oh)fese and ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2od)fese single crystals prepared using sn metal instead of fe powder at 120 @xmath25c showed the same @xmath3 at 42 k , higher than other samples without using sn . the advantage of sn metal was to create a reducing environment without introducing iron oxide impurities , due to lack of fe powder .",
    "although we have established here that the ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2oh)fese system likely does not have a parent antiferromagnetic phase , we do not suggest that the chalcogenide - based superconductors are not linked to the arsenide - based superconductors from the present results .",
    "the fe@xmath64te@xmath65ch@xmath66 for @xmath67 = se and s phases in particular exhibit a rich magnetic phase diagram@xmath68 before superconductivity sets in with chemical substitution.@xmath69 the ordered vacancy phase of k@xmath29fe@xmath17se@xmath18.@xmath30 has also shown an antiferromagnetic transition at large temperatures ( about 559 k)@xmath70 while the disordered vacancy phase exhibits a @xmath3 close to 30 k.@xmath71 what distinguishes those two systems , however , from the present compound and fese , is the lack of a large magnetic moment on iron in the latter compounds.@xmath72 in fe@xmath64te it can be as large as 2 @xmath54@xmath55@xmath73 and in k@xmath29fe@xmath17se@xmath18 as large as 3.3(1 ) @xmath54@xmath55.@xmath70 not surprisingly , when in the superconducting regime , both compounds exhibit a spin resonance energy in the inelastic neutron spectra , which corresponds to spin fluctuations .",
    "a large magnetic moment is clearly not the case in the present system .    as to the ferromagnetic transition observed at about 10 k in the sample with a @xmath3 of 34 k ,",

    "in conclusion , we have successfully mapped out a phase diagram for ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2od)fese and have found that the highest @xmath3 for deuterated samples is 42 k , and the @xmath3 for both deuterated and hydroxide samples correlate with lattice constants . since the highest @xmath3 observed for the hydroxide sample was also approximately 42 k ,",
    "we conclude that there is no isotope effect on the superconducting properties in substituting h by d. mild hydrothermal preparation for long reaction times can lead to the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity .",

    "<S> we report the phase diagram for the superconducting system ( @xmath0li@xmath1fe@xmath2od)fese and contrast it with that of ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2oh)fese both in single crystal and powder forms . </S>",
    "<S> samples were prepared via hydrothermal methods and characterized with laboratory and synchrotron x - ray diffraction , high - resolution neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) , and high intensity npd . </S>",
    "<S> we find a correlation between the tetragonality of the unit cell parameters and the critical temperature , @xmath3 , which is indicative of the effects of charge doping on the lattice and formation of iron vacancies in the fese layer . </S>",
    "<S> we observe no appreciable isotope effect on the maximum @xmath3 in substituting h by by d. the npd measurements definitively rule out an antiferromagnetic ordering in the non - superconducting ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2od)fese samples below 120 k , which has been reported in non - superconducting ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2oh)fese.@xmath4 a likely explanation for the observed antiferromagnetic transition in ( li@xmath1fe@xmath2oh)fese samples is the formation of impurities during their preparation such as fe@xmath5o@xmath6 and lixfeo2 , which express a charge ordering transition known as the verwey transition near 120 k. the concentration of these oxide impurities is found to be dependent on the concentration of the lithium hydroxide reagent and the use of h@xmath7o vs. d@xmath7o as the solvent during synthesis . we also describe the reaction conditions that lead to some of our superconducting samples to exhibit ferromagnetism below @xmath3 . </S>"
