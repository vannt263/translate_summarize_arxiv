    "negative refraction is a very interesting phenomenon which nowadays attracts a lot of attention .",
    "intuitively , negative refraction can be imagined as the phenomenon at the interface between two media when the refracted and incident beams of light remain on the same side of the interface normal .",
    "most frequently , the work by veselago  @xcite is cited as the one which represents the early efforts on the negative refraction studies . for",
    "a brief history of related studies performed before  @xcite , the reader may refer , for example , to  @xcite .",
    "it is quite often believed that negative refraction appears at the interface of artificial media , such as metamaterials  @xcite or photonic crystals  @xcite .",
    "however , negative refraction has also been observed at interfaces of conventional media , for example , anisotropic materials  @xcite , or metallic wedges  @xcite .    the work by veselago  @xcite considers the most straightforward way to obtain negative refraction .",
    "according to veselago , if a medium has both negative permittivity , @xmath0 , and negative permeability , @xmath1 , the resulting refractive index is also negative , @xmath2 , thus providing negative refraction at the interface with a medium whose index @xmath3 is positive .",
    "this idea is utilized in metamaterials , where one uses the overlapping of permittivity and permeability resonances to achieve simultaneously negative @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the obvious disadvantage of such an approach is that , as with any resonant media , metamaterials are highly absorptive .",
    "therefore , theoretical studies of negative refraction in metamaterials should consider the propagation of light in lossy media .    from many standard textbooks ( for example ,  @xcite ) we know that , unlike lossless media , the waves transmitted into lossy media are , in general , inhomogeneous ( or nonuniform ) , that is , their planes of constant phase and constant amplitude are not parallel .",
    "thus as a first step to understand negative refraction in metamaterials we need to consider the formation of inhomogeneous waves at the interface of lossy media , characterized by complex permittivity and permeability .",
    "inhomogeneous waves in conventional conducting media ( with complex @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) have been thoroughly studied and discussed in many classical textbooks .",
    "some generalizations of the classical theory were made in  @xcite .",
    "however , the classical theory of inhomogeneous waves does not consider negative refraction .",
    "the authors of  @xcite made an attempt to apply the formalism of inhomogeneous waves in order to explain the results of numerical simulations of negative refraction in a metamaterial prism and slab .",
    "unfortunately , they used the formulas of the classical theory , where they formally substituted the complex refractive index of the metamaterial by a negative value @xmath3 , defined as @xmath7 .",
    "however , in an inhomogeneous wave propagating in a lossy medium , the actual refractive index and attenuation coefficient depend on the incident angle and , therefore , the value @xmath3 loses its meaning of a complex refractive index  @xcite .",
    "this means that the criterion of negative refraction proposed by veselago  @xcite and based on negative @xmath3 should be reconsidered .    in order to extend the classical theory of inhomogeneous waves , in this work we study negative refraction of inhomogeneous waves at the interface of lossy isotropic media . unlike the previous authors  @xcite we use a parametrization of inhomogeneous waves which allows us to find explicitly all the necessary parameters of transmitted waves , up to their signs . in  @xcite , to obtain these parameters , one needs to find a unique solution of a system of four nonlinear equations with multivalued inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions . in  @xcite ,",
    "the parameters of transmitted waves are given only in a quadratic form .",
    "additionally , unlike  @xcite , we consider a more general problem , where both media at the interface are , in addition to a complex permittivity @xmath4 , characterized by a complex permeability @xmath5 .",
    "after the formal derivation of all the necessary equations , we show that the inhomogeneity of transmitted waves affects negative refraction .",
    "we demonstrate that the recently reported criterion of negative refraction that requires negative real parts of @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite is applicable only in the case of a homogeneous incident wave at the interface between a lossless and lossy media . in a more general situation ,",
    "when the incident wave is inhomogeneous , or both media are lossy , the criterion of negative refraction becomes dependent on an incident angle .",
    "in particular , we show that negative refraction can be realized in conventional lossy materials if their interfaces are properly oriented .",
    "let us consider a plane monochromatic wave propagating in a lossy isotropic medium with complex permittivity @xmath8 and permeability @xmath9 .",
    "the electric , @xmath10 , and magnetic , @xmath11 , field vectors of such a wave are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are complex amplitude vectors , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the wavevector and a position vector , respectively , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the frequency and time . in a lossy medium the wavevector @xmath15 is complex , that is , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real phase and attenuation vectors , respectively . if the vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not parallel , the planes of constant phase and constant amplitude ( defined as @xmath22const and @xmath23const , respectively ) are not parallel either , and the corresponding wave is inhomogeneous .",
    "we can formally define the refractive index @xmath24 and attenuation coefficient @xmath25 of an inhomogeneous wave through the lengths of @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "such definition retains the physical meaning of the refractive index and attenuation coefficient ; namely , @xmath24 equals to the ratio of @xmath28 to the phase velocity and @xmath25 determines the distance at which the amplitude is reduced to @xmath29 times .",
    "note that both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real and positive by definition , since we determine them through the length of a real vector .    by separately equating the real and imaginary parts in the dispersion equation @xmath30 , where the complex value @xmath31 is defined as @xmath7",
    ", we find  @xcite @xmath32 in which @xmath33 is the angle between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that inhomogeneous waves with @xmath34 can exist in lossless media ( @xmath35 ) if @xmath36 in  ; that is , if @xmath37 . for example , such a kind of inhomogeneous wave describes total internal reflection , where a wave at the boundary of two lossless media propagates along the boundary and attenuates in the direction perpendicular to the interface . additionally , and indicate that @xmath38 and @xmath39 only if @xmath40 ; that is , if @xmath41 ( homogeneous damped waves ) .",
    "thus the complex quantity @xmath3 loses its traditional meaning of refractive index for inhomogeneous waves ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "therefore , a natural question occurs : how should we reinterpret the criterion of negative refraction that is commonly believed to be @xmath43?.",
    "to answer this question , we examine the formation of inhomogeneous waves at the interface of two lossy isotropic media : the first medium is characterized by a complex permittivity @xmath44 and permeability @xmath45 , and the second medium by @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the incident wave comes from the first medium , and a unit interface normal @xmath48 points to the second medium ( see figure  [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "orientation of the phase and attenuation vectors at the interface ( white plane ) of two lossy isotropic media .",
    "the blue and red planes are the incidence planes for the phase and attenuation vectors , respectively . ]",
    "the wavevectors @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 of the incident , reflected and transmitted waves can be written as the sum of two vectors that are parallel and perpendicular to the interface  @xcite : @xmath52 the parallel components @xmath53 are continuous across the interface : @xmath54 =                   [ { \\boldsymbol{\\hat{q}}}\\times[{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{\\rm r}\\times{\\boldsymbol{\\hat{q } } } ] ] =                   [ { \\boldsymbol{\\hat{q}}}\\times[{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{\\rm t}\\times{\\boldsymbol{\\hat{q}}}]].\\ ] ] the normal components have magnitudes @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58    for the most general case , all three wavevectors @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ) are complex , that is , @xmath63 . therefore , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 ,          \\qquad & { \\boldsymbol{p } } '' = [ { \\boldsymbol{\\hat{q}}}\\times[{\\boldsymbol{k}}_{\\rm i}''\\times{\\boldsymbol{\\hat{q } } } ] ] ,          \\label{eq : p'p '' } \\\\      & q_\\alpha ' = ( { \\boldsymbol{k}}_\\alpha'\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\hat{q } } } ) ,                 & q_\\alpha '' = ( { \\boldsymbol{k}}_\\alpha''\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\hat{q}}}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by separately equating the real and imaginary parts in  , we obtain two sets of equations for the phase vectors @xmath67 and attenuation vectors",
    "@xmath68 : @xmath69 according to   the phase vectors @xmath67 and attenuation vectors @xmath68 , in general , lie in two different planes ( see figure  [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "in other words , at the plane interface of two lossy isotropic media , there are , in general , two incidence planes : the incidence plane for the phase vectors ( spanned by @xmath70 and @xmath48 with the normal @xmath71 $ ] ) and attenuation vectors ( spanned by @xmath72 and @xmath48 with the normal @xmath73 $ ] )  @xcite .",
    "two incidence planes result in two sets of equalities for the snell s law , for the phase and attenuation vectors , respectively .",
    "we find them by equating the magnitudes of the real and imaginary parts in   and using the definitions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the angles between the unit normal @xmath48 and the associated phase vectors @xmath67 and attenuation vectors @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "before we focus on the transmitted wave , we make a simple remark on the reflected wave .",
    "the reflected wave has the same inhomogeneity as that of the incident wave , so that @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( the reflection angles are @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) .",
    "this implies that if the first medium is lossless and the incident wave is homogeneous , then the reflected wave is also homogeneous , even if the second medium is lossy  @xcite .",
    "now we examine the transmitted wave whose phase and attenuation vectors are given by  . in",
    "we need to determine the projections @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which are the real and imaginary parts of the complex projection @xmath83 .",
    "note that we can not uniquely determine @xmath84 by  , since @xmath84 is in the quadratic form .",
    "standard textbooks choose a positive sign for @xmath84 , or equivalently @xmath85 and @xmath86 , because the phase vector and , consequently the phase velocity , are outgoing from the interface only for this choice of sign .",
    "we now know , however , that the phase velocity can be incoming towards the interface if negative refraction takes place . thus a careful study is necessary to unambiguously determine the sign of @xmath84 . for this purpose",
    "we introduce a complex dimensionless parameter @xmath87 defined as @xmath88 for its real and imaginary parts , we find @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , taking into account that @xmath81 and @xmath82 are real by definition , we obtain @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 . to find the signs of @xmath81 and @xmath82 we express them as @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are their signs .",
    "then , since @xmath97^{1/2 }         = s's''\\sqrt{\\xi''^2}=s's''|\\xi''|$ ] , we find that @xmath98 thus the signs @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the same if @xmath101 , and opposite if @xmath102 . specific values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 can be selected only by applying an additional constraint : that the energy flux in the second medium must be directed away from the interface .",
    "mathematically we write this constraint as @xmath103 , meaning that the projection of the time - averaged poynting vector @xmath104 of the transmitted wave on the interface normal must be non - negative .    to calculate @xmath81 and @xmath82 by  , we need to express @xmath105 and @xmath106 through some known values such as permittivities , permeabilities , incident angles , etc . to do so we substitute   into   and then separate the real and imaginary parts .",
    "as a result we obtain @xmath107 using  , we express the terms with @xmath108 and @xmath109 in   and through the parameters of the incident wave : @xmath110 where the angle @xmath111 between @xmath70 and @xmath72 can be found from   for the incident wave",
    ". then we obtain @xmath112    having clarified the sign issue of the complex projection @xmath84 , we now turn to the refractive index @xmath113 and attenuation coefficient @xmath114 . from",
    "and we have @xmath115 , which is equal to @xmath116 . therefore , we obtain @xmath117^{1/2}$ ] where we have chosen the `` + '' sign since @xmath118 is positive by definition .",
    "similarly , we obtain @xmath119^{1/2}$ ] . with the help of  , we find that @xmath113 and @xmath114 can be written as @xmath120 equations   and clearly show that the refractive index @xmath113 and attenuation coefficient @xmath114 depend not only on the material properties of the second medium , but also on the incident angles @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "to summarize the results of this section , we describe how one can find the parameters of the transmitted wave if the corresponding parameters of the incident wave are known :",
    "( i ) calculate @xmath105 and @xmath106 from   and ( @xmath111 can be found from  ) ; ( ii ) find the refractive index @xmath113 and attenuation coefficient @xmath114 from   and ; ( iii ) with the obtained @xmath113 and @xmath114 calculate the transmission angles @xmath123 and @xmath124 using   and ; ( iv ) find the signs of @xmath81 and @xmath82 in  , utilizing   with the additional constraint @xmath103 , where the time - averaged poynting vector of the transmitted wave , @xmath104 , should be calculated separately .    before concluding this section , we wish to say a few words about the limitations of the model .",
    "it is known that , at optical frequencies , the permeability @xmath125 loses its usual physical meaning  @xcite . to overcome this problem the authors of  @xcite proposed describing the linear response of a negatively refractive medium by a spatially dispersive permittivity tensor @xmath126 .",
    "however , they showed that , as long as the spatial dispersion is restricted to terms @xmath127 , the formal description of a medium by @xmath128 and @xmath125 is adequate , if an effective permeability is introduced , even if this permeability loses its original physical meaning .",
    "thus our model implies a weak spatial dispersion and the effective permeabilities @xmath129 and @xmath130 that do not have a direct physical meaning .",
    "in addition , we note that the spatial dispersion is formally present in our result , because the obtained refractive index and attenuation coefficient depend on an incident angle ( see   and ) , and consequently , on a wavevector of the incident wave .",
    "as a first example , we consider a single interface where the first medium is a lossless dielectric ( @xmath131 ) and the second medium is lossy and isotropic ( see figure  [ fig : interface ] ) .",
    "we further assume that the incident wave is a homogeneous plane wave , which is characterized by the real wavevector @xmath132 ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) , refractive index @xmath135 , and incident angle @xmath136 . according to   and",
    ", the condition @xmath133 means that @xmath137 and @xmath138 . as a consequence the transmission angle @xmath139 .",
    "thus the attenuation vector @xmath140 of the transmitted wave is normal to the interface for any incident angle . in other words , equiamplitude planes of the transmitted wave",
    "are always parallel to the interface  @xcite .",
    "orientations of the phase and attenuation vectors at the interface between a lossless dielectric and a lossy isotropic medium .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) are cases of positive ( @xmath101 ) and negative ( @xmath102 ) refraction . note",
    "that @xmath133 is assumed for both cases . ]    for the case of a single interface   and can be simplified as @xmath141 with these @xmath105 and @xmath106 we can calculate the refractive index @xmath118 and attenuation coefficient @xmath142 of the transmitted wave using   and , and then the transmission angle @xmath123 using  .    to find the orientation of @xmath143 and @xmath140 , we need to determine the signs of their projections @xmath81 and @xmath82 in  . in  [ sec : kp ] we obtain  , which says that , in any lossy medium , the projection of an attenuation vector onto a time - averaged poynting vector is always positive . in our case",
    "reads as @xmath144 , where @xmath104 is the time - averaged poynting vector of the transmitted wave . by substituting @xmath140 from   into   and taking into account that @xmath137 , we find @xmath145 . since the condition for the energy flux to be directed away from the interface is @xmath103 , we eventually find that @xmath82 must be positive",
    "that is , the attenuation vector @xmath140 of the transmitted wave is outgoing from the interface .",
    "the condition @xmath146 means that we should choose @xmath147 in  . as a result",
    ", we obtain that the sign of the projection @xmath81 is given by @xmath148 .",
    "thus , if @xmath102 we have @xmath149 and the phase vector is incoming towards the interface , and hence negative refraction takes place .",
    "therefore , the criterion of negative refraction is @xmath102 , which , according to  , is equivalent to @xmath150 thus , starting from the most general case of light wave transmission through two lossy isotropic media , we have rediscovered the well - known criterion for negative refraction , which implies negative @xmath151 and @xmath152  @xcite .",
    "we note that the angle @xmath153 between @xmath143 and @xmath140 is equal to @xmath123 , since @xmath139 . therefore ,",
    "if the condition of negative refraction is satisfied and @xmath154 , we have @xmath155 . in other words ,",
    "negative refraction is accompanied by the formation of inhomogeneous waves with an obtuse angle between equiamplitude and equiphase planes ( see figure  [ fig : interface](b ) ) . using this argument",
    ", we can now clarify the relation between negative refraction and the condition of @xmath43 : at an angle @xmath156 the cosine in   becomes negative , which results in a negative @xmath157 on the right - hand side of the equation ( @xmath158 is positive in lossy media ) .",
    "in particular , in the case of negative refraction at normal incidence @xmath159 and @xmath160 in  . as a result , we find @xmath161 and @xmath162 . in this case",
    "the choice between a negative cosine and negative @xmath157 is a matter of preference ; hence our theory does not violate the commonly used criterion for negative refraction ; namely , that @xmath157 is negative .",
    "but our theory predicts more than that : it says that , if an incidence angle is different from zero , the use of @xmath157 and @xmath158 instead of @xmath24 and @xmath25 can result in an error .        to be more quantitative",
    "we now assume that the first medium is vacuum and the second medium is the negative - index metamaterial reported as structure 3 in  @xcite . to retrieve the permittivity and permeability of this metamaterial we digitized the relevant data from  @xcite and then approximated it by the drude model using parameter fitting  @xcite .",
    "according to the retrieved parameters , the value of @xmath106 is negative in the spectral region between 710 and 800  nm , irrespective of the incidence angle .",
    "figures  [ fig : mtheta](a)(c ) show the change of @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath123 , calculated by  , and , as functions of the wavelength and the incidence angle @xmath163 . at normal incidence , as was mentioned before , the spectral dependencies of @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( black curves in figure  [ fig : mtheta ] ) reproduce the absolute values of the corresponding experimental data from  @xcite . for example , the spectral dependence of @xmath113 at normal incidence is the modulus of a well - known bell - gap shape which one usually observes in experiments ( see figure  3 in  @xcite ) .",
    "we see that both @xmath113 and @xmath114 increase as @xmath163 increases . from figure",
    "[ fig : mtheta](b ) we find that the absorption is minimum at @xmath164 .",
    "as @xmath163 increases from zero , the transmission angle @xmath123 very quickly approaches almost @xmath165 , which means that @xmath143 becomes nearly parallel to the interface ( see figure  [ fig : mtheta](c ) ) .",
    "unfortunately , at incidence angles different from zero , we can not directly compare the above example with the experimental data , since the metamaterial in  @xcite is anisotropic .",
    "instead , we consider @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath123 in figure  [ fig : mtheta ] as characteristic parameters of some hypothetical isotropic metamaterial whose permittivity and permeability are represented by the drude model .",
    "since the majority of existing metamaterials are highly anisotropic , the assumption of such isotropic metamaterials in this work may raise questions .",
    "however , the first isotropic metamaterials have been fabricated very recently  @xcite .      in section  [ sec :",
    "laws ] we have shown that the sign of the @xmath106 parameter determines the directions of the phase and attenuation vectors in the transmitted wave ( see  ) . in particular , for a single interface , we have shown that , if @xmath102 , then the phase vector of the transmitted wave points towards the interface .",
    "that is , @xmath102 is the criterion of negative refraction .    according to  , in general",
    ", @xmath106 consists of two terms .",
    "the first term is associated with the material properties of a medium below the interface , while the second term depends on the incident angles and thus is associated with the geometry of the problem .",
    "hereinafter we will refer to the first and second terms of @xmath106 in   as the _ material _ and _ geometric _ terms , respectively . we have already seen that for a single interface the geometric term is zero .",
    "since the sign of @xmath106 affects the criterion of negative refraction , we expect that this criterion will change if we manage to find a case where the geometric term is nonzero .",
    "the attenuation vector of any incident wave coming from a lossless medium is zero and therefore has a zero parallel component .",
    "since the parallel components of attenuation vectors must be continuous across the interface ( see  ) , the attenuation vector of the transmitted wave must be perpendicular to the interface in order to also have a zero parallel component .",
    "this argument holds for any number of subsequent interfaces which are parallel to the first one .",
    "therefore , to obtain a nonzero geometric term , we need to consider a case where an incident wave has a nonzero attenuation vector that is tilted relative to the interface .",
    "this is most easily realized by a lossy prism ( see figure  [ fig : prism ] ) where the attenuation vector of the wave transmitted through the first prism interface forms the angle @xmath166  equal to the prism angle  with the second prism interface . as a result ,",
    "the parallel components of the attenuation vectors at the second prism interface become nonzero , and accordingly the corresponding geometric term becomes nonzero . if , in addition , we want to obtain negative refraction at the exit of the prism , the medium below the second prism interface must be lossy , since in lossless media the poynting and phase vectors are co - directional and the poynting vector is necessarily directed away from the interface .",
    "the metallic prism lying on the semi - infinite surface of another metal and surrounded by vacuum .",
    "the incoming wave is incident normally on the first prism interface .",
    "the phase and attenuation vectors are marked in blue and red , respectively . at this stage",
    "the orientations of the phase and attenuation vectors in the underlying metal are unknown and indicated only schematically . ]    after these considerations , we now investigate the following problem .",
    "a metallic prism lies on a semi - infinite surface of another metal ( see figure  [ fig : prism ] ) and surrounded by vacuum .",
    "the prism and underlying metal are characterized by the complex permittivities @xmath46 and @xmath167 , respectively , and permeabilities @xmath168 .",
    "a homogeneous incident wave comes normally from vacuum to the first prism interface .",
    "this wave is characterized by a real wavevector @xmath169 , zero attenuation vector @xmath170 , refractive index @xmath171 , attenuation vector @xmath172 and incident angle @xmath173 .",
    "using the procedure described at the end of section  [ sec : laws ] , we find that the wave transmitted through the first prism interface is characterized by the complex wavevector @xmath174 , with the phase vector @xmath175 and attenuation vector @xmath176 perpendicular to the interface ; refractive index @xmath177 and attenuation coefficient @xmath178 , where @xmath179 and @xmath180 are given by @xmath181 ; and transmission angles @xmath182 .",
    "since the @xmath183 parameter for the first interface has the imaginary part @xmath184 ( see  ) , refraction at this interface is always positive .",
    "if we are interested only in the principal ray far away from the prism s edge ( such that we can neglect the effects of multiple reflections inside the prism and diffraction on the prism edge ) , then at the second prism interface we can formulate the following problem ( see figure  [ fig : pdirections ] ) : the incident wave is characterized by the complex wavevector @xmath185 with a zero angle @xmath111 between @xmath70 and @xmath72 ; refractive index @xmath186 and attenuation coefficient @xmath187 , where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are given by @xmath188 ; and incidence angles @xmath189 , where @xmath166 is the prism angle .",
    "we seek to find the orientation of the phase vector @xmath143 and attenuation vector @xmath140 of the transmitted wave relative to the interface .",
    "according to   and , the parameter @xmath87 for the considered interface is given by @xmath190 and @xmath191 , or taking into account   and , by @xmath192 where @xmath106 has the geometric term @xmath193 , which is nonzero and negative for any nonzero prism angle @xmath166 .    as we have shown in section  [ sec : laws ] , the directions of @xmath143 and @xmath140 relative to the interface are specified by the sign of @xmath106 ( see  ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath106 is such that the sign @xmath99 of the projection @xmath194 is negative , then @xmath143 is directed towards the interface , and hence negative refraction takes place . according to",
    ", @xmath106 is positive if @xmath195 and negative otherwise . using   and",
    ", we categorize all possible orientations of @xmath143 and @xmath140 into the following cases ( see figure  [ fig : pdirections ] ) :    * @xmath196 and @xmath197 . both @xmath143 and @xmath140",
    "are directed away from the interface .",
    "refraction is positive . *",

    "@xmath199 and @xmath202 while @xmath147 .",
    "vector @xmath143 is directed towards the interface , while @xmath140 points away from the interface .",
    "refraction is negative .",
    "it might seem strange that the attenuation vector in cases ( b ) and ( c ) points towards the interface .",
    "naively , one can come to the conclusion that in these cases the amplitude of the transmitted wave grows exponentially as the wave moves away from the prism , which violates the energy conservation law .",
    "however , the attenuation vector pointing towards the interface merely reflects the fact that the amplitude of the transmitted wave decreases in the direction from the sharp to the blunt end of the prism , since the thicker part of the prism absorbs more . to resolve the confusion",
    ", we note that there is always a fraction of the incident wave that propagates without going through the prism ( to the left of the prism edge in figure  [ fig : prism ] ) .",
    "therefore , the growth of the transmitted wave amplitude is always limited by the amplitude of the incident wave . thus cases ( b ) and",

    "the parallel component of @xmath140 is nonzero , we can no longer apply the inequality   to uniquely determine the sign of @xmath82 . instead , we need to find an expression for @xmath104 and directly consider which of the cases ( a)(d ) does not violate the inequality @xmath103 . to simplify the task , we assume that the incident wave is p - polarized ; that is , in figure  [ fig : prism ] the electric field vector of the wave incident on the first prism interface lies in the plane spanned by vectors @xmath203 and @xmath204 ( plane of the figure ) .",
    "we additionally assume that the frequency of the incident wave is less than the plasma frequency of the underlying metal ; that is , @xmath205 . in  [ sec : poynting ] we show ( see  ) that for p - polarized incident wave the condition @xmath103 is equivalent to @xmath206 .",

    "we have pointed out that cases ( b ) and ( d ) correspond to negative refraction at the second prism interface . in case ( b )",
    "negative refraction is realized if both conditions of   and are fulfilled . since usually @xmath217 , the condition of",

    "this effect should be distinguished from negative refraction of energy flux , that is , of poynting vector . in anisotropic and lossy",

    "we have shown that the inhomogeneity of transmitted waves can affect negative refraction .",
    "in particular , we have shown that , if a homogeneous wave is incident on the interface between a lossless and lossy isotropic media , negative refraction is accompanied by the formation of an inhomogeneous wave with an obtuse angle between the equiphase and equiamplitude planes . in this case , the criterion of negative refraction is equivalent to the well - known one that requires negative real parts of permittivity and permeability .",
    "however , in a more general case , when the incident wave is inhomogeneous or both media are lossy , the criterion of negative refraction becomes dependent on an incident angle . in particular , we have shown that negative refraction can be realized in the system of a metallic prism lying on the surface of another metal .",
