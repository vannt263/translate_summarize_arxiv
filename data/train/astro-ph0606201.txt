    "among the different stellar components of our galaxy are a thin and thick disc , a halo , spiral arms , possibly a stellar ring and the bulge / bar .",
    "the bar / bulge components ( bulge , or bar , or bulge + bar ) are perhaps the most difficult to disentangle from other components because of extinction and our perspective of them due to our position in the galactic plane ( zhao 2000 ) ; they have been the topic of recent controversy concerning their morphology ( e.g.  sevenster et al .",
    "1999 ; garzn 1999 ; merrifield 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "our hypothesis in this debate has been that there are indeed two components ( hammersley et al .",
    "2001 ) : a bar which is long and in the plane ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , and a triaxial bulge , which is short and much wider in latitude ( observable at @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) . their position angles ( angle between the major axis and the solar vector radius ) might not be coincident , although the latest measurements give values that do not differ greatly : 43@xmath8 for the long bar ( hammersley et al .",
    "2000 ; hereafter h00 ) ; and 28@xmath9(syst . ) for the triaxial bulge ( lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the story of the galactic bar really begins with the discovery of large non - circular velocities in the 3 kpc and 135 km / s spiral arms ( rougoor & oort 1960 ; rougoor 1964 ) .",
    "de vaucouleurs ( 1964 ) was the first to attempt to explain the motions of these arms in terms of a non - axisymmetric potential ( a bar ) at the centre of the galaxy .",
    "he later predicted that the milky way was of type sab(rs)bc on the grounds of the galaxy s high spiral arm multiplicity , broken ring structure and non - circular h  i motions ( de vaucouleurs 1970 ) .",
    "the non - axisymmetry hypothesis , or `` field model '' , was not well received at the time by the astronomical community , which favoured oort s ( 1977 ) `` ejection model '' , advocating the expulsion of gas from the centre of the galaxy , even though it would require energies of the order 10@xmath10 erg to power such an expansion of the spiral arms ( van der kruit 1971 ) .",
    "kerr ( 1967 ) , however , explained the 3 kpc and 135 km / s arms in terms of a bar . peters ( 1975 ) modelled the h  i distribution derived from @xmath11@xmath12 diagrams in the inner 4 kpc of the galaxy in terms of concentric elliptical orbits .",
    "he found that an orientation of 45 deg w.r.t .  to the solar radius vector fitted the maximum number of radio features in the @xmath11@xmath12 diagrams , including the 3 kpc and 135 km / s arms .",
    "with regard to molecular gas , nakai ( 1992 ) compared co ( @xmath13 ) emission maps of the barred spiral galaxies maffei 2 , ngc 2903 and ngc 253 with that of the milky way galaxy ( derived from the co radial velocity at a sample of galactic longitudes ) .",
    "all four galaxies show a similar radial co distribution with a sharp central peak and a secondary hump ( corresponding to the bar  spiral arm transition ) .",
    "the radio evidence , then , gave strong indications of : a ) a non - axisymmetric distribution of gas orbits and b ) a co intensity distribution that corresponded with other barred galaxies .",
    "our hypothesis concerning the existence of a long bar originate from near - infrared two micron galactic survey data ( tmgs , garzn et al .",
    "it began with an analysis of @xmath14-band tmgs star counts that led hammersley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to posit the existence of a bar of radius 4 kpc , with one of the tips at @xmath15 , and the other one at @xmath16 , which would give an angle of 75 degrees .",
    ", so that the angle of the bar is instead @xmath17 . ]",
    "calbet et al .  (",
    "1995 ) presented `` tomographs '' of the galactic plane ( derived from tmgs star counts and using the rather inaccurate assumption of a dirac delta luminosity function , which could serve as a zeroth order approximation of the structure of the galaxy ) , and the long bar was evident ( figure 14 of calbet et al .",
    "1995 ) , extending over a radius larger than 33.5 kpc , although the method was not accurate enough to provide information about its morphology .",
    "calbet et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also proposed the existence of a dust lane preceding the bar at negative longitudes , which would explain the higher extinction observed in this region .",
    "considerable progress was made by h00 , who measured the distance of several points along the bar , including @xmath15 , and , using a technique of analysis of red - clump stars in near - infrared colour  magnitude diagram , concluded that the angle was @xmath18 .",
    "the same analysis with the same data , only using near - infrared filters , was presented by picaud et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who also compared the data with the besanon model ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) , and they obtained a similar result ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "other papers of our team ( garzn et al .  1997 ;",
    "lpez - corredoira et al .  1999 , 2001b )",
    "have produced further evidence , as will be described in section [ .counts ] .    concerning the stellar populations , ng ( 1998 ) finds two populations towards the galactic centre : an old metal rich population ( @xmath200.08 , @xmath21 = 1315 gyr ) , presumably the old galactic bulge , and a younger less metal - rich population ( @xmath220.03 , @xmath239 gyr ) , perhaps the long bar .",
    "cole & weinberg ( 2002 ) also showed a non - axisymmetric structure that is likely to have been formed more recently than 3 gyr ago and must be younger than 6 gyr .",
    "however , they are at @xmath24 so they were possibly measuring the suburbs of the long bar , some anomalously young population in the bulge , or some contamination of the disc .    it is supposed that bars form as the result of an instability in differentially rotating discs ( sellwood 1981 ) whereas bulges are a primordial galactic component",
    ", so this distinction makes sense and it is not merely an artefact invented to fit certain morphological features .",
    "athanassoula & misiriotis ( 2002 ) , athanassoula ( 2005 ) and athanassoula & beaton ( 2006 ) use @xmath25-body simulations to produce long bars , which are broadened in at their centres into boxy bulges ( the ratio of sizes between the semi - axis of the long bar and the major axis of the boxy bulge is approximately 1.5 ) .",
    "boxy bulges are in fact just a part of the long bar ( athanassoula 2005 ) . from a comparison of their @xmath25-body simulations and near - infrared photometry athanassoula & beaton ( 2006 ) argue that the boxy bulge of m31 extends into a long bar .",
    "there is a striking parallel with our own galaxy , which also has a boxy bulge ( picaud & robin 2004 ; lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "2005 ) that extends into the long bar described in this and previous papers .",
    "bars might be vertically extended ( kuijken 1996 ) but they might be constrained to the plane too .",
    "indeed , many other galaxies exhibit both a bar and a bulge ; e.g.ngc 3351 , ngc 1433 and ngc 3992 , whose images in the palomar plates , for instance , show the existence of both structures .",
    "nevertheless , many authors ( reviewed by merrifield 2004 ) have for many years ignored the bar + bulge hypothesis and preferred to speak about a unique non - axisymmetric structure , namely a bar ( i.e.  bulge ) that is triaxial , short and fatter ( what we call this component the bulge ) .",
    "these authors did not consider the possibility of a long bar constrained in the galactic plane .",
    "although they were more or less successful in fitting the stars in off - plane regions , the abundance of new data now indicates that some new component in the galactic plane at longitudes @xmath26 is being observed that is unexplainable in terms of a disc + bulge + extinction model .",
    "this fact will be corroborated in  [ .counts ] with all - sky _ 2mass _ and _ msx _ data .",
    "in addition , in  [ .redclump ] we use red clump star data from the recent literature ( including new observations of our own : cabrera - lavers et al .",
    "2006b ) to reinforce the old picture of our hypothesis that there is a long bar apart from the bulge .",
    "furthermore , the position angle obtained in the past is confirmed by the latest data ( benjamin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "( 2001b ) used star counts and extinction maps of negative latitudes and confirmed the general picture of a long bar : higher counts in the positive than in negative longitudes ( for @xmath27 and strictly in the plane @xmath28 ) .",
    "this north / south asymmetry was confirmed with recenter glimpse data by benjamin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , with 25% more sources in the north , although they do not include the region @xmath29 .",
    "lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "( 2001b ) also show a higher extinction on average iat negative latitudes .",
    "babusiaux & gilmore ( 2005 ) say , however , that they see no asymmetry in the extinction , but we think they have only four points to measure the asymmetry , and one of them ( @xmath30 ) has a minimum according to lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "( 2001b , fig . 8) . when the star counts are statistically corrected for extinction by using the colours , a clean image of the negative latitudes of the galaxy is obtained ( lpez - corredoira et al .",

    "3 ) summarizes the model .",
    "unavane & gilmore ( 1998 ) and alard ( 2001 ) also explored asymmetries in star counts in the plane but only for @xmath32 .    with the data of _ 2mass _",
    "all - sky data release ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) in the @xmath14 band , we plot the star counts up to @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2mass ] , and show a clear asymmetry .",
    "we corroborate the results by lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , who used denis and tmgs data for some regions ( not all - sky ) to claim that a long bar must be present , and that this structure is beyond the bulge region ( @xmath34 ) , extending to nearly @xmath35 in positive longitudes .    with _ msx _ mid - infrared data ( egan et al .",
    "1999 ) we also see the same trend .",
    "figure [ fig : msx ] clearly shows the excess at positive galactic longitudes ; it also shows a deficit between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which indicates that the bar at negative latitudes finishes at @xmath38 ( the feature at @xmath16 is thought to be the 3 kpc ring ; lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "garzn et al .  (",
    "1997 ) and lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "( 1999 ) confirmed spectroscopically that most of the brightest @xmath14-band stars at @xmath15 in the plane are supergiants , thereby reinforcing the argument that this region contains a prominent star formation region possibly associated with the end of the bar where it meets the scutum spiral arm .",
    "freundenreich ( 1998 ) realized that there are significant residuals in the plane over @xmath27 after subtracting the disc and the bulge in _",
    "cobe_/dirbe data ; however , he prefers to attribute these residuals to patchy star formation in a ring or spiral arms .",
    "picaud ( 2004 ) also says that this star formation region might be associated with some other structure such as a ring .",
    "however , as plotted in lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "( 2001b , fig .  6 ) , a ring would produce a shape in the distribution of star counts different from that shown in figure [ fig:2mass ] .",
    "moreover , the deficit of stars observed between @xmath36 and @xmath37 in fig .  [ fig : msx ] indicates the absence of any possible continuous structure between @xmath39 and @xmath16 ; a ring should be continous , whereas our bar finishes at @xmath40 .",
    "the bar fits the star counts perfectly , whereas the ring does not . a spiral arm solution on the far side of the galaxy ( at distance 1012 kpc ) or closer than the central region of the galaxy ( distances less than 5 kpc ) is also discarded because of the arguments given by hammersley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and because , as will be shown in ",
    "[ .redclump ] , the distance of this structure does not fit any ring or spiral arm possibility .",
    "extinction is also discarded by hammersley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "( 2001b ) .",
    "furthermore , a closer examination of extinction - corrected counts , for instance that in lpez - corredoira ( 2005 , fig .  1 ) , shows a still higher number of counts at positive longitudes . in fig .",

    "glimpse ( benjamin et al .  2005 ) and _ msx _ mid - infrared data ( fig .  [ fig : msx ] ) also show the asymmetry and are much less affected by extinction .",
    "the red clump method is well known and explained in several papers ( e.g.  stanek et al .  1997 ; h00 ; lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "2002 ) : in a colour  magnitude diagram , the maximum of the density of the red clump stars is identified with the major axis of the bar along each line of sight .",
    "this is not strictly true ; it is a good approximation only when the bar is thin , that is , a very elongated structure , a long bar rather than a thick bulge . in our case , the bar is thin because there is a dispersion of @xmath42 0.50.6 mag for the red clump , including the intrinsic broadening of the red clump itself and the dispersion of distances ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sigma ] ) . in a thick bulge ,",
    "the maximum density in the line of sight is at the tangential point of the line of sight with the ellipsoids and may differ from the major axis position by @xmath431 kpc , but the difference is only @xmath4350 pc for the thin bar ( appendix [ .dif ] ) . also , there is a difference between the maximum density along the line of sight and the maximum of the star counts of the red clump vs.  the apparent magnitude , which is again negligible for thin bars ( 2550 pc ) and somewhat more important for the thick bulge ( 100300 pc ) ( appendix [ .dif2 ] ) .",
    "some authors , e.g.  babusiaux & gilmore ( 2005 ) , have not considered these effects and applied the method to fit the major axis of a thick - bulge structure , which is very inaccurate .    by gathering the different data in the literature with measurements of the distance as function of galactic longitude in the galactic plane ( constrained to @xmath44 ) , we get fig . [",

    "they also use the red clump method and find that the position angle for @xmath50 is different from the position angle derived with all the data @xmath29 .",
    "they attribute this to the existence of a new structure at @xmath50 but we believe that this could possibly be the effect of a superposition of a bulge and a long bar . in fig .",

    "their results are that all the points except @xmath54 fit a bar with a position angle of 22.5@xmath1 .",
    "the field at @xmath54 is chosen to contain the presence of a stellar ring or pseudo - ring at the end of the bar .",
    "the field at @xmath55 presents a wide dispersion of distance owing perhaps to the added presence of distant ( i.e.  at the other side of the bar ) disc red clump stars .",
    "we think that babusiaux & gilmore are observing the long bar and that the angle that their data give is possibly compatible with a position angle of around 4045 degrees , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : redc ] .",
    "however , they reject this hypothesis on the grounds that , in their view , a bulge + bar would produce a spread in the red clump distances ; possible alternative explanations are that the bar might be predominant in the plane , that the angle of bulge and bar might be very similar in the plane , or that the spread real but low to separate both populations . *",
    "benjamin et al .",

    "the presence of this point is used by babusiaux & gilmore ( 2005 ) to claim that the bar position angle is @xmath68 ( a fit made with only 3 points and rejecting the point at @xmath54 ) , but in view of all the other data , it is more likely that we have to reject instead the point at @xmath65 .",
