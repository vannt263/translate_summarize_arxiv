    "we describe a recipe that allows one to adapt some cohomological results from complex manifolds to hypercomplex manifolds .",
    "a hypercomplex manifold is a complex manifold together with a second complex structure that anticommutes with the first one . to extract cohomological information out of a hypercomplex manifold",
    ", we may thus start with the double complex of the underlying complex manifold , twist this data by the second complex structure and see what information we get about the hypercomplex manifold in question .",
    "this approach turns out to be surprisingly successful if we want to adapt results from complex geometry to hypercomplex geometry and the resulting cohomology groups have the additional advantage of being easily computable .",
    "we would like to anticipate that this way of proceeding also suffers from some drawbacks and that there is an alternative approach available in the literature . if a manifold admits two anticommuting complex structures @xmath1 and  @xmath2 , then @xmath3 is another almost - complex structure , anticommuting with both @xmath1 and  @xmath2 .",
    "this then leads to a whole 2-sphere worth of almost - complex structures @xmath4 and it has been shown that all of these almost - complex structures are integrable as soon as @xmath1 and @xmath2 are ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "from this point of view , all these complex structures should be treated equally on a hypercomplex manifold and singling out a preferred complex structure , as we do with  @xmath1 , is not very natural .",
    "unfortunately , the cohomology groups based upon the  averaged complex structures \" often tend to be quite cumbersome to work with and less explicit to compute .",
    "for further information , we refer the interested reader to  @xcite .    in the present note we summarise some results from the recent preprints  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank the organisers of the indam meeting _ complex and symplectic geometry _ for the great conference held in june 2016 in cortona , italy .",
    "while complex manifolds have been around for a long time , the study of hypercomplex manifolds only became prominent in the eighties with publications such as  @xcite .",
    "probably the most well - known class of hypercomplex manifolds are hyperkhler manifolds .",
    "however , the realm of hypercomplex manifolds is much broader than the one of hyperkhler manifolds . to cite but a few hypercomplex non - hyperkhler manifolds , note that some nilmanifolds , that is quotients of a nilpotent lie group by a cocompact lattice , admit hypercomplex structures  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dominic joyce constructed many left - invariant hypercomplex structures on lie groups  @xcite and similar ones have been analysed by physicists interested in string theory  @xcite in the context of @xmath5 supersymmetry . in more recent years , various authors constructed inhomogeneous hypercomplex structures : see for example  @xcite for hypercomplex structures on stiefel manifolds as well as @xcite .    a complete classification of compact hypercomplex manifolds of real dimension  4 , called _ quaternionic curves _",
    ", has been established by charles p.  boyer  @xcite .",
    "these are either 4-tori or k3 surfaces , both of whom are hyperkhler , or else quaternionic hopf surfaces  @xcite which , even if non - hyperkhler , remain locally conformally hyperkhler . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation becomes much more complicated for compact hypercomplex manifolds of real dimension  8 , called _",
    "hypercomplex surfaces_. while compact complex surfaces are nowadays well understood thanks to the work of kunihiko kodaira  @xcite , a similar classification for compact hypercomplex surfaces is still missing . in the sequel of this note",
    ", we will hence focus on hypercomplex manifolds of real dimension  8 , the first  unsolved dimension \" .",
    "in this section we first briefly review some well - known cohomological aspects of complex manifolds and then show how these can be adapted to hypercomplex manifolds . for the cohomological properties of complex manifolds we refer the reader to  @xcite and the references therein whilst the hypercomplex cohomologies appear in  @xcite to cite but a few of them .",
    "an almost complex manifold @xmath6 is a smooth manifold @xmath7 of real dimension @xmath8 together with an endomorphism of the tangent bundle @xmath9 that satisfies @xmath10 .",
    "this _ almost complex structure _ @xmath1 can be used to decompose the bundle of complex - valued one - forms @xmath11 into the subbundle @xmath12 and the subbundle  @xmath13 , with @xmath1 acting on the sections of @xmath12 by @xmath14 and on those of @xmath13 by  @xmath15 we get the following decomposition @xmath16 we denote by @xmath17 the sections of @xmath18 and define the _ dolbeault operators _ @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the exterior derivative and @xmath21 is the projection onto @xmath17 . clearly , @xmath22 for any function @xmath23 . however , a priori , the same is not true for higher degree forms as explained in figure  [ fig:1 ] :    @xmath24    an almost complex manifold @xmath6 is integrable if and only if @xmath25 on any complex manifold @xmath6 , there is a double complex @xmath26 with two anti - commuting differentials .",

    "to this end , we will keep the decomposition of complexified differential forms with respect to the almost - complex structure  @xmath1 . as the almost - complex structures @xmath1 and @xmath2 anticommute",

    ", a direct computation shows that @xmath43 for all @xmath41 if and only if the nijenhuis tensor @xmath44 of the almost complex structure  @xmath2 vanishes .",

    "as it turns out , this actually implies that all of the maps in the above diagram become isomorphisms  @xcite .",
    "we deduce that , on a compact complex manifold @xmath6 , the bott ",
    "chern and aeppli cohomology groups may differ from the dolbeault and derham cohomology groups ( if the @xmath73-lemma does not hold ) .",

    "tomassini quantifies this difference :    [ theorem1]@xcite let @xmath6 be a compact complex manifold of real dimension  @xmath8",

    "then @xmath79 for any @xmath80 where the space @xmath81 is defined by @xmath82 moreover , the @xmath69-lemma holds if and only if we have equality for all @xmath83 .",
    "while these results look very similar , the conclusions we draw differ .",
    "more precisely , recall that the betti numbers appearing in the right - hand - side of   are topological invariants .",
    "as the dimensions of the cohomology groups are upper semi - continuous , angella and tomassini deduce from theorem  [ theorem1 ] that , on compact complex manifolds , the @xmath73-lemma is stable by small complex deformations  @xcite .",
    "however , the same reasoning fails on compact hypercomplex manifolds , because the term @xmath84 appearing in the right - hand - side of   in theorem  [ theorem2 ] has no reason to be a topological invariant .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that the @xmath69-lemma is not stable by small hypercomplex deformations as illustrated in the example in section  [ sectionexample ] .",
    "+ finally , theorems  [ theorem1 ] and  [ theorem2 ] also allow us to quantify how far away a complex manifold is from being  cohomologically khler \" and similarly how far away a hypercomplex manifold is from being  cohomologically hkt \" ( see section  [ sectionmetrics ] ) . define the _ non - khler - ness degrees _",
    "@xcite on complex manifolds @xmath85 and the _ non - hkt - ness degrees _",
    "@xcite on hypercomplex manifolds @xmath86",
    "every complex manifold @xmath6 admits a hermitian metric , that is  a riemannian metric  @xmath87 such that @xmath88 we can build out of this the hermitian form @xmath89 and various special metrics can be characterised via conditions on @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , any hypercomplex manifold @xmath27 admits a quaternionic hermitian metric , that is a riemannian metric @xmath87 which satisfies @xmath91 this leads to three ( not necessarily closed ) differential forms @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 that can be assembled to build the fundamental form @xmath95 which is of type @xmath96 with respect to the complex structure @xmath1 .",
    "once more , various special metrics can be characterised by imposing conditions on the form @xmath97 . if , for instance , the form  @xmath97 is @xmath20-closed then @xmath98 is called a _",
    "_ manifold whereas if @xmath97 is @xmath38-closed , then @xmath98 is called _ hyperkhler with torsion _ , or _ hkt _ for short ( see  @xcite for a nice introduction ) . table  [ tab:2 ] summarises some special metrics on hypercomplex manifolds together with their associated conditions on @xmath97 as well as their complex counterparts .",
    "we point out that hkt metrics , just as khler metrics in the complex setup , admit a local potential  @xcite .",

    "a complex manifold always admits a gauduchon metric and this metric is unique in its conformal class up to a constant . on the other hand , to recover existence of a quaternionic gauduchon metric on hypercomplex manifolds , we will impose an additional holonomy constraint as described in the next section .",
    "there is a particular class of hypercomplex manifolds , called @xmath108-manifolds , that shares more properties of complex manifolds than general hypercomplex manifolds do .",
    "the key reason for this is that the canonical bundle of an @xmath108-manifold is holomorphically trivial and this leads to a version of hodge theory when hkt  @xcite and to a version of serre duality on the bundle  @xmath109 .",
    "another important difference between complex and hypercomplex geometry is the existence of a special connection .",
    "a complex manifold generally admits infinitely many torsion - free connections which preserve the complex structure  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "any hypercomplex manifold admits a unique torsion - free connection @xmath110 such that @xmath111 this connection is called the obata connection  @xcite . in general , the obata connection does not preserve the metric , except when the manifold is hyperkhler .",
    "given any torsion - free affine connection , the holonomy group introduced by lie cartan measures the failure of the parallel translation associated to a connection to be holonomic .",
    "merkulov and schwachhfer classified the groups which can possibly arise as irreducible holonomy groups of torsion - free connections  @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig:3 ] , in the case of the obata connection , there are three possible choices : @xmath112 , @xmath108 and @xmath113 .",
    "indeed , as the obata connection preserves all three complex structures , its holonomy is necessarily contained in the quaternionic general linear group  @xmath112 .",
    "it turns out that , for all nilmanifolds , the holonomy is contained in the commutator subgroup @xmath108  @xcite .",
    "finally , a hyperkhler manifold is characterised by the fact that the holonomy of the obata connection is equal to the compact symplectic group @xmath114 , that is the hyperunitary group . for the homogeneous hypercomplex structure on @xmath115 constructed by joyce ,",
    "the holonomy is equal to  @xmath116  @xcite .",
    "one important aspect of @xmath108-manifolds is that , if the metric is hkt , then it is possible to establish a version of hodge theory  @xcite .",
    "indeed , any @xmath108-manifold has holomorphically trivial canonical bundle .",
    "the nowhere degenerate real holomorphic section @xmath118 ( that is a nowhere degenerate section @xmath118 such that @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) which trivialises @xmath121 may then be used to define a hodge star operator on a @xmath108-manifold @xmath98 @xmath122 via @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the @xmath125-bilinear extension with respect to @xmath1 of the quaternionic hermitian metric @xmath87 associated to @xmath97 . on compact manifolds",
    ", this leads to the adjoints @xmath126 and thus to the laplacians @xmath127 on @xmath128-manifolds , the hodge @xmath129 acts as an involution on @xmath130 and hence we may decompose @xmath96-forms into @xmath131-self - dual ones and @xmath131-anti - self - dual ones . as @xmath129 commutes with  @xmath132 , this splitting descends to cohomology .",
    "we conclude that , on a compact @xmath128-manifold , the space  @xmath133 can be decomposed as a direct sum of @xmath38-closed @xmath131-self - dual and @xmath38-closed @xmath131-anti - self - dual forms .      besides the conjugation symmetry , compact complex manifolds also satisfy serre duality coming from the pairing on @xmath134 given by @xmath135,[\\beta ] ) \\mapsto \\int_x \\alpha \\wedge \\beta.\\ ] ] on compact @xmath108 manifolds , an analogue of this exists and can be formulated as follows ( see also figure  [ fig:4 ] ) .",

    "furthermore , serre duality and @xmath108-symmetry also provide links between bott  chern and aeppli cohomologies .",
    "indeed , using the above pairings , it can be shown that serre duality on compact complex manifolds of real dimension @xmath8 implies that @xmath139 and similarly @xmath108-symmetry on compact @xmath108-manifolds implies that @xmath140 .",
    "we saw that compact @xmath128-manifolds share many properties of compact complex surfaces , most notably a version of hodge theory when it is hkt and similar symmetries .",
    "hence it should not surprise that many results valid on compact complex surfaces can be adapted to results on @xmath128-manifolds . to illustrate this link , we display in table  [ tab:3 ] some results which show that hkt metrics play a similar role on @xmath128-manifolds than khler metrics do on complex surfaces .",
