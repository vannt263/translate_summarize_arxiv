    "tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole in a galactic nucleus has been investigated by many authors ( hills 1975 , lacy et al .",
    "when a star s trajectory happens to be sufficiently close to a supermassive black hole , the star will be captured and eventually tidally disrupted .",
    "after the star is disrupted , at least half of the debris is ejected from the system , the remainder remains bound to the black hole and is accreted ( rees 1988 ; ayal et al .",
    "the accretion of this stellar debris has been predicted to power a luminous electromagnetic flare that is expected to peak in the optical , ultraviolet(uv ) and x - ray wavelengths , lasting for months to years ( ulmer 1999 ; stubbe & quataert 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "swift j164449.3 + 573451 ( also known as grb 110328a in the beginning , hereafter swift j1644 + 57 ) has been proposed as a tidal disruption candidate ( bloom et al .",

    "swift j1644 + 57 was initially discovered as a long - duration gamma - ray burst ( grb 110328a ) by the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) .",
    "swift follow - up observations with the ultraviolet and optical telescope ( uvot ) and x - ray telescope ( xrt ) began 1475 s after the initial trigger .",
    "no source was seen in the uvot observations , but a bright point source was found with the xrt ( bloom et al .",
    "it remained bright and highly variable for a long period , and re - triggered the bat three times .",
    "this high - energy transient is unlike any known events , such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , or gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the bat and xrt spectral fits are consistent during the brightest flaring stage , and well fitted with a broken power - law model ( burrows et al .",
    "2011 ) . considering the repeated extremely short timescale x - ray flares ,",
    "wang & cheng ( 2012 ) proposed a later internal shock model for the x - ray flares of swift j1644 + 57 , in which the reverse shock is relativistic and the forward shock is newtonian . from the strong emission lines of hydrogen and oxygen ,",
    "the redshift of swift j1644 + 57 is @xmath0 ( levan et al .",
    "2011 ) . from the x - ray , optical , infrared , and radio observations",
    ", it is found that the position of this source is consistent with the nucleus of the host galaxy ( bloom et al .",
    "this event has not been detected by the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) or veritas ( aliu et al .",
    "2011 ) . only upper limits were given in the gev and tev bands .",
    "the peak isotropic luminosity of swift j1644 + 57 is about @xmath1 ( bloom et al .",
    "2011 ; burrows et al . 2011 ) , which is about @xmath2 times larger than the eddington luminosity of a @xmath3 black hole . due to this super - eddington luminosity and the position of swift j1644 + 57 relative to the center of its host galaxy",
    ", it is suggested that swift 1644 + 57 is powered by a relativistic jet created by accretion onto a @xmath4 black hole ( bloom et al .",
    "2011 ; burrows et al . 2011 ; shao et al .",
    "the jet lorentz factor was limited to @xmath5 from high - energy observations ( burrows et al .",
    "2011 ) , the event rate ( burrows et al .",
    "2011 ) , and radio observations ( zauderer et al . 2011 ; berger et al .",
    "wong et al . ( 2007 ) first argued that the x - ray emission of a tidal disruption event may not necessarily come from radiation of the accretion disk alone .",
    "instead , it may be related to a jet . as the jet travels in the interstellar medium , a shock",
    "is produced and synchrotron radiation is expected .",
    "they compared the light curve and the synchrotron radiation spectrum in their model with the observed data and found that the model can well explain the observed transient x - ray emission from ngc 5905 and the late - time spectrum .",
    "some theoretical models have been proposed to explain unusual features of this event , e.g. swift j1644 + 57 could be explained as a white dwarf disrupted by a @xmath6 black hole ( krolik & piran 2011 ) or a tidal obliteration event , which disrupts a star in a deeply plunging orbit at periastron ( cannizzo et al .",
    "lei & zhang ( 2011 ) argued that the jet is launched by the blandford - znajek mechanism ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) and found the spin parameter of the central black hole is very high .",
    "further , lei , zhang & gao ( 2013 ) inferred the inclination angle between the black hole spin axis and the star orbit .",
    "saxton et al .",
    "( 2012 ) studied the x - ray timing and spectral evolution of this event and found that the spectrum became mildly harder in its long - term evolution .",
    "gao ( 2012 ) argued that the outflow should be poynting - flux dominated .",
    "de colle et al ( 2012 ) have shown that the stochastic contribution of the luminosity due to the feeding rate variability induced by instabilities can explain the x - ray light curve of swift j1644 + 57 using a two - dimensional simulation .",
    "berger et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and metzger et al .",
    "( 2012 ) modelled the radio emission of swift j1644 + 57 using the grb afterglow model .",
    "berger et al . ( 2012 ) also found that the energy increase can not be explained with continuous injection from an @xmath7 tail and the relativistic jet has a wide range of lorentz factors .",
    "most recently , zauderer et al . (",
    "2013 ) found that the x - ray flux has a sharp decline by a factor of 170 at about 500 days .",
    "based on the late x - ray light curve , which is composed of multi x - ray flares , we propose that the x - ray emission comes from the reverse shock produced by the late ejected shell colliding with the decelerating material , which is decelerated by the ambient medium through which it moves .",
    "the whole scenario of our model is as follows : at the beginning , the central engine ejects relativistic shells with higher velocity ( corresponding to higher lorentz factor ) .",
    "they catch up with the outermost slower shell and the consequent reverse shocks produce the early ( @xmath8 s ) x - rays , as has been proposed by wang & cheng ( 2012 ) . at later times , the central engine ejects shells with lower velocity ( lower lorentz factor ) , and at the same stage , the outermost shell has been decelerated by the medium , which * drives * an external shock .",
    "this external shock produces the radio emission ( metzger et al .",
    "2012 ; berger et al .",
    "then ejected shells collide with this outermost decelerating material , and the reverse shocks produce the late x - rays , which decreases with time as the density of the emitting region decreases .",
    "the late injection of the shells also enhances the total energy of the external shock , which provides the needed energy resource as to explain the late enhancement of the radio emission presented by berger et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the later x - rays emission , which is produced by collisions between ejected shells and the decelerating material .",
    "we describe our model in section [ model ] , and conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the x - ray emission shows very rapidly flaring in the whole radiation period from the beginning until several @xmath9 seconds .",
    "this suggests that the flares should not come from the continuous external shock .",
    "however , the external shock does exist , and may emit mainly at optical and radio frequencies when the early ejected shells combine and sweep the ambient medium . with the continuous activity of the central engine fed by material still * remaining * around the central black hole , the late ejected shells will eventually catch up with the external decelerating shock , and a reverse shock emerge back into the ejected shells .",
    "berger et al . ( 2012 ) also found that the outflow is structured and the relativistic jet was produced with a wide range of lorentz factors .",
    "consequently , the forward shock will proceed into the shocked medium .",
    "however , if the number density of the shocked medium is high enough ( corresponding to a weak non - relativistic forward shock , which depends on the contrast of the density between the two regions ( sari & piran 1995 ) ) , this forward shock will be weak enough and the corresponding emission would be negligible ; and the bulk lorentz factor of the reverse shock will be the same as that of the external shocked material . if the energy of the shell is much smaller than the kinetic energy of the external shock , the influence on the dynamics of the external shock can be neglected .",
    "the behaviour of the external shock can be described in the same way as a standard grb afterglow ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "the scenario for the late x - ray emission in our model is as follows : the continuous external shock mainly emits radio and optical emission , and the late ejected shells collide on the decelerating external shocked material , the reverse shock of each collision produces one flare of the x - ray emission .",
    "superposition of all the flares by these episodically ejected shells composes the whole late flaring x - ray light curve .",
    "the following are the details of the scaling laws :    the lorentz factor of the external shock is ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number density of the medium , @xmath12 is the redshift , @xmath13 is the isotropic kinetic energy of the external shock , and @xmath14 is the observer s time . the notation @xmath15 is used throughout the paper .",
    "the evolution of the lorentz factor is consistent with the radio observation at 216 days after the bat trigger ( berger et al .",
    "for example , at @xmath16 days , the lorentz factor is about 2.2 for @xmath17 erg and @xmath18 @xmath19 from observation . at the late time",
    ", the lorentz factor @xmath20 has decreased into a relatively low region , and the edge of the jet will be seen by the observer for a normal jet opening angle @xmath21 .",
    "agn jets are also confirmed from super - massive black holes .",
    "the apparent opening angle can be as high as tens of degrees in an agn jet , while the intrinsic opening angle could be as low as a few degrees ( pushkarev et al .",
    "so our choice of @xmath22 is reasonable . for relativistic motion",
    ", the relation between radius and observing time is @xmath23 .",
    "the radius evolution with time is then @xmath24    we denote the reversely shocked and unshocked regions of the ejected shell as regions 3 and 4 respectively , and the forwardly shocked and unshocked medium as regions 2 and 1 respectively .",
    "the average lorentz factor of protons in the reverse shock ( region 3 ) is @xmath25 ( if @xmath26 ) , where @xmath27 is the bulk lorentz factor of the reverse shock , and @xmath28 is the bulk lorentz factor of the ejected shell .",
    "we get @xmath29    because of the spread of velocities inside a single shell , at times later than @xmath30s the spreading effect dominates the width of the ejected shell , which is @xmath31 ( sari & piran 1995 ) .",
    "the duration of the reverse shock is determined by the competition of the width of the shell and the jet angular size , i.e. , @xmath32 , as @xmath33 , @xmath22 in this case .",
    "then , the duration of each pulse is @xmath34 the value of the duration is several times larger than the observed duration of the individual pulses .",
    "however , notice @xmath35 is very sensitive to the jet opening angle .",
    "it requires the value of @xmath36 to be a bit smaller than @xmath37 .",
    "similar to the treatment in zou , wu & dai ( 2005 ) , the number density of the reverse shock region is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number density of the ejected shell , which is determined by the lorentz factor @xmath28 and the total kinetic energy @xmath40 .",
    "the internal energy density of the reverse shock is @xmath41    after the dynamical values are settled on , we follow the method to get the synchrotron radiation of sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) .",
    "the electrons are accelerated into a power - law distribution : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the randomized electron lorentz factor , @xmath44 is the minimum lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons and @xmath45 is the power - law index .",
    "assuming that constant fractions @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the internal energy go into the electrons and the magnetic field , we have the magnetic field @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the internal energy density of the shocked material .",
    "one gets @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the peak spectral power of the synchrotron emission for one electron is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath54 is the electron charge .",
    "the peak observed flux density is then @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the total isotropic equivalent number of electrons in region 3 , and @xmath57 is the luminosity distance .",
    "here we need to consider the beaming factor @xmath58 @xmath59 , as the jet opening angle is smaller then @xmath60 , and the isotropic solution should be corrected by the beaming factor ( rhoads 1999 ) , while the lateral expansion is not considered for simplicity , a fact also supported by numerical simulations ( cannizzo et al .",
    "2004 ) . with @xmath61 ,",
    "the corresponding luminosity distance is @xmath62 cm in a cosmological model @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( wright 2006 ) .",
    "the cooling lorentz factor @xmath65 is defined such that the electron with @xmath65 approximately radiate all its kinetic energy in the dynamical time , i.e. , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) is the synchrotron radiation power of an electron with lorentz factor @xmath43 in the magnetic field @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the dynamical time in the comoving frame .",
    "then the cooling lorentz factor is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the thompson scattering cross - section .",

    "this value is somewhat bigger than a rough average of the observed photon index 1.8 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath90 is calculated for the time when the reverse shock just crosses the shell ( @xmath90 decreases from the beginning until this time ) .",
    "therefore , for each pulse , there is a period when @xmath90 is higher than the observed frequency and the case is @xmath114 , and then the average photon index could be smaller than 1.9 . for the time @xmath115 s @xmath116 s , @xmath117 , with x - ray spectral index between @xmath118 , i.e. , ( -0.9,-0.4 ) , and for @xmath119 s , @xmath120 , with x - ray spectral index @xmath121 , i.e. , -0.4 .",

    "[ fig - spectra ] .",
    "we can clearly see the transition of the photon index from this figure , which can be well understood by the model ( solid line ) .",
    "although during the transitional period ( @xmath133 s , @xmath130 s ) the photon indices varying with time does not trace the solid line , this might come from the diversity of the late ejected shells .",
    "for times earlier than @xmath133 s , the predicted flux is higher than the observed one .",
    "this might be caused by the transition of the external shock from a coasting phase into a decelerating phase .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a scenario for the late x - ray emission from swift j1644 + 57 , namely , a central engine produces long - lasting episodic relativistic ejecta .",
    "these ejecta catch up with the decelerating material , which sweeps the medium , and the reverse shock propagating back into the ejecta emit the observed flaring x - rays . as the ejecta are shells but not a steady jet",
    ", the emission appears as flares . as shown in figs . 1 and 2 , our model is well consistent with the observed peaks of the flares on both the envelope of the light curve and the photon indices .",
    "this scenario inherits the ` prompt ' emission picture , as proposed by wang & cheng ( 2012 ) .",
    "both of them are from the reversed shock of the central engine ejection , which gives a complete scenario for this event . at the beginning",
    ", the central engine produces shells with higher velocity .",
    "they catch up the outermost slower shell and the consequent reverse shocks produce the early ( 1-@xmath134 s ) x - rays . at later times , the central engine eject shells with relatively lower velocity ( assumed to be with the same lorentz factor @xmath28 for the whole late times ) , and at the same stage , the outermost shell has been decelerated by the medium , which * drives * an external shock .",
    "then ejected shells collide with this decelerating material , and the reverse shocks produce the late x - rays , which decreases with time .",
    "the late injection of the shells also enhance the total energy of the external shock , which provides the needed energy resource to explain the late enhancement of the radio emission .",
    "our model predicts the x - ray peaks will continue its @xmath135 slope until the external shock dominates the radiation , which will appear shallower with a less variable light curve .",
    "this can be examined by the follow - up observations .",
    "although the scenario for the late x - rays is a follow up to the scenario for the earlier x - ray emission proposed by wang & cheng ( 2012 ) , there are some significant differences .",
    "first , the objective is different .",
    "wang & cheng ( 2012 ) treated the early emission ; while this paper treats the late x - ray emission with obvious flare .",
    "secondly , the scenario is different .",
    "the reverse shock is produced by collision between later ejected shells and decelerating material in this paper .",
    "but the reverse shock in wang & cheng ( 2012 ) is produced by two shells colliding .",
    "the physical origin of the reverse shock is quite different .",
    "thirdly , in this paper , the width of the reversely shocked region 3 is much longer than that of wang & cheng ( 2012 ) , because of the spreading of shells .",
    "so the duration of the reverse shock is also long .",
    "the duration of x - ray pulse is about @xmath134 s from observation ( saxton et al .",
    "2011 ) , which is consistent with our model ( see eq .",
    "4 ) . in our model , as the relativistic jet shuts off , there is no shell catching up with the decelerating material , the emission of the reverse shock ( mainly in x - rays ) disappears .",
    "the x - ray emission of the external shock is weak , which is consistent with swift and chandra observations ( zauderer et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the origin of the hard electron distribution ( @xmath136 ) is not yet clear .",
    "the observations also confirmed the evidence for hard electron distribution in some grbs ( dai & cheng 2001 ; huang et al .",
    "2006 ; covino et al .",
    "simulations of the fermi process in relativistic shocks including large angle scattering have resulted in hard electron energy spectra ( stecker , baring & summerlin 2007 ) .",
    "the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) scattering is not considered here , as the compton parameter @xmath137 is much less than 1 . without including klein - nishina effects , @xmath138",
    "( sari & esin 2001 ) , the radiation efficiencies are @xmath139 ( only suitable for @xmath140 however ) for @xmath141 and @xmath142 for @xmath143 respectively .",
    "for the parameters chosen here , @xmath144 .",
    "however , for the typical lorentz factor @xmath145 , and the typical frequency in the comoving frame * @xmath146 hz , the main ssc emission at @xmath147 ( sari & esin 2001 ) is deeply suppressed by the klein - nishina effects and the final @xmath137 parameter is much less than 1 .",
    "* this is also consistent with non - detection by fermi and hess at higher energy bands .",
    "our model may also be used for the grbs with long term x - ray flares , like grbs 070311 ( vergani & guidorzi 2008 ) , and 071118 ( cummings 2007 ) . the off - axis case of our model",
    "may also be applied to the galactic center , where a gas cloud is ongoing to the central black hole ( gillessen et al .",
