    "during the last two decades , observational discoveries both external to and within the solar system have provided strong evidence that giant planets experience large - scale orbital migration after their formation . outside the solar system the peculiar small orbits of the so - called ` hot jupiters ' and",
    "their unlikely in situ formation suggest that these gas giants underwent large - scale , radial migration to their observed short - period orbits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at early times ( @xmath9myr )",
    "this might be accomplished via interactions with the progenitor gas disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at later times migration may be driven by scattering and redistribution of a planetesimal disk .",
    "in addition , multi - planet systems may suffer orbital instabilities in which giant planets undergo mutual scattering events that may eject planets from the system altogether and leave the surviving ones with large orbital eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "such stochastic evolution can account for the orbital characteristics of many observed extrasolar planets .",
    "closer to home , the resonant structure of the kuiper belt testifies to the large - scale radial redistribution of the solar system s giant planets more generally .",
    "the eccentric and inclined orbit of pluto , and the cohort of plutinos in neptune s exterior 3:2 mean motion resonance , can be naturally explained by the outward migration of neptune @xcite . as the number of solar system characteristics that can be attributed to processes associated with planet migration continues to increase ,",
    "there is a growing consensus that large - scale planetary migration did occur in the solar system and that many of its dynamical structures were determined during , and represent artifacts of , this epoch ( e.g. , see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "due to their large masses and angular momenta , the giant planets are the dominant perturbers of the solar system",
    ". therefore the period of giant planet migration was one in which enormous orbital perturbations swept through the solar system .",
    "clearly the timing and duration of this epoch informs the evolution of the rest of the system .    because of their hydrogen and helium rich compositions ,",
    "the formation of jupiter and saturn must have been completed during the first few million years of the solar system s history while the gaseous protoplanetary disk still persisted .",
    "the accumulation of uranus and neptune , is considerably less constrained @xcite and remains an area of active research ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "estimates of the formation timescale of these planets reflect our modest knowledge of their accumulation and span a wide range from @xmath10 years @xcite .",
    "virtually all models suggested for the accretion of uranus and neptune are inefficient at incorporating the mass of an initial planetesimal disk into the ice giants on reasonably short timescales ( e.g. ,  @xmath1110 myr ) and the scattering of these planetesimals may lead to radial spreading and migration of the growing planets . as a result , disk masses , several times that of the observed planets ( i.e. ,  the so - called minimum mass nebula ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and formation locations well interior to their current orbits are often invoked to account for the accretion of uranus and neptune .",
    "however , local concentrations of planet building blocks at planet trapping radii ( such as the ice line or the interface between outward and inward migration ) may decrease the formation timescale of cores with sufficient mass ( @xmath12 ) to initiate rapid gas accretion @xcite .",
    "the formation of jupiter leads to gap formation in the solar nebula . near the outer edge of this gap ,",
    "surface density and pressure maxima ( at radii near or beyond jupiter s 2:1 mmr ) also facilitate the accumulation of grains , protoplanetary embryos and the formation of additional giant planet cores @xcite .",
    "this sequential formation process may provide a scenario for the formation of the gas and ice giant planets before the depletion of the gaseous nebula , with modest , rather than extensive migration , mostly driven by their tidal interaction with both residual disk gas and planetesimals @xcite .",
    "the epoch , mode , and characteristic timescale in which the solar system s giant planets migrated has important implications for the evolution of the planetary system .",
    "giant planet migration models in particle disks can be loosely divided into two classes , based on the principal mode of migration .",
    "planetesimal - driven migration results from the efficient scattering of small bodies by giant planets and is characterized by the smooth radial divergence of planets embedded in a planetesimal disk .",
    "recent models of this process in the solar system suggest that the giant planets orbits diverge with approximately exponential migration timescales of @xmath13myr .",
    "in contrast to smooth radial planetesimal - driven migration , a global instability among the giant planets , involving close encounters and gravitational scattering between planets , results in large stochastic jumps in the semimajor axes , eccentricities , and inclinations of the planets . because the planets traverse large changes in semimajor axis very quickly",
    ", the bulk of planetary migration may be complete in a few million years .",
    "a recent effort to construct a comprehensive model of planetary migration has succeeded in explaining several distinct dynamical characteristics of the solar system as a product of specific giant planet migration histories .",
    "the so - called nice model suggests that the orbits of the giant planets evolved through phases of both planetesimal - driven migration and planetplanet scattering ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . in initial versions of this model ,",
    "the instability of the giant planets is initiated by the divergent migration of jupiter and saturn across their mutual 2:1 mean motion resonance @xcite .",
    "dynamics associated with the crossing of the 2:1 mean motion resonance ( hereafter mmr ) play a fundamental role in the nice model as they are also responsible for facilitating the capture of jupiter s trojan asteroids with large orbital inclinations @xcite .    in the inner solar system , planetary formation",
    "may have been completed prior to the time when the giant planets reached their observed orbits .",
    "both dynamical models of terrestrial planet accretion and cosmochemical evidence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that terrestrial planet formation was completed in @xmath14myr .",
    "uncertainties in the formation timescale of uranus and neptune ( e.g.  ranging from @xmath15 yr ) combined with estimates of migration timescales ( @xmath16 myr for planetesimal - driven migration or much shorter for planetplanet scattering ) suggest that migration of the solar system s giant planets may have taken place before , during , or after terrestrial planet formation . identifying when and how giant planet migration occurred remains an outstanding problem .    indeed , the late orbital evolution of the solar system s giant planets has even been invoked to account for cratering events on the moon , an explanation that necessarily requires fully formed terrestrial planets to bear witness to the epoch of giant planet migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the so - called late heavy bombardment of the moon ( hereafter lhb ) refers to a period from @xmath17 ga ago when the lunar basins with known ages formed ( @xcite @xcite ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed review ) .",
    "the formation of these basins may be attributed to a sharp increase in the cratering rate of the moon several hundred million years after planet formation was complete .",
    "the late orbital evolution of the giant planets has been identified with this dramatic increase in the lunar cratering rate via a variety of dynamical mechanisms including the sweeping of resonances through the asteroid belt due to planetary migration , the late formation of uranus and neptune @xcite , orbital instabilities among the giant planets resulting in orbit crossing , and planetplanet gravitational scattering @xcite , or an orbital instability resulting from the divergent migration of jupiter and saturn across their mutual 2:1 mmr as in the nice model @xcite . in each of these models , objects on",
    "previously stable orbits are dislodged by the evolution of the giant planets and delivered to earth crossing orbits .",
    "implicit to each model is the assumption that the terrestrial planets are unaffected by the gross instability and/or changes in the giant planets orbits which are responsible for destabilizing the lhb impacting population .",
    "here we examine this assumption in detail .",
    "specifically , we examine how the divergent migration of jupiter and saturn from a more compact configuration to their current orbits may perturb the terrestrial planets .",
    "if the terrestrial planets witnessed an era of giant planet migration , their present - day orbits offer two main dynamical constraints : ( 1 ) the terrestrial planets must remain stable during the epoch of migration and ( 2 ) the dynamical structure the terrestrial planets emerging from the migration epoch must be consistent with the observed terrestrial system . since the solar system s giant planets migrate as a coupled system , any constraints on the migration of jupiter and saturn may also be considered as implicit constraints on the formation and migration of uranus and neptune .",
    "we develop linear secular models to identify migration histories of jupiter and saturn that strongly couple them to the terrestrial planets via apsidal secular resonances .",
    "we adapt models for secular resonant sweeping to predict the excitation of the terrestrial planets as a function of the orbital state of jupiter and saturn at the time of resonance and their migration timescale .",
    "finally , we use these models to identify migration histories that are consistent with the observed orbital properties of the terrestrial planets .",
    "this paper is organized in the following fashion . in section [ sec : lin_theory ] , we describe the secular model and its utility for examining planetary migration . in section [ sec : secres ] , we discuss how passage through linear secular resonances excites eccentricities and how these events may be used to constrain giant planet migration histories . in sections",
    "[ sec : js12 ] and [ sec : g21 ] , we compare the predictions of the linear theory with the results of @xmath18-body simulations . in section [ sec : disc ] , we evaluate model assumptions , discuss the implications of our prinicipal results , and summarize our findings .",
    "initial results , including the development of our secular model , the identification of secular resonances , and some numerical simulations were presented in a conference talk .",
    "subsequently , @xcite have also examined this problem within the context of the nice model using @xmath18-body simulations .",
    "our linear model predictions are in general agreement with , and provide a theoretical framework that accounts for , the results of their simulation results .",
    "we compare the two where appropriate .",
    "the apsidal orbital precession of a system of planets can be described using a set of linear first - order differential equations , whose solution is a system of eigenmodes .",
    "the equations of motion for the evolution of the planets eccentricities ( @xmath19 ) and longitude of perihelia ( @xmath20 ) can be constructed from the disturbing function by assuming that terms involving the mean longitudes are small and retaining lowest - order terms in the eccentricity and inclinations . for planet @xmath21 ,",
    "lagrange s equations for the eccentricity vector @xmath22 are @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are a planet s mass , semimajor axis , and mean motion , respectively .",
    "the standard terms where @xmath30 , @xmath31max@xmath32 , @xmath33min@xmath32 , and laplace coefficients ( @xmath34 ) have been used .",
    "post - newtonian corrections for relativistic precession are included in the diagonal matrix elements where @xmath35 is the speed of light .",
    "solving these equations for a planetary system is an eigenvalue problem whose eigenfrequencies ( @xmath36 ) are real and represent the precession frequencies of the modes .",
    "the solutions are of the form @xmath37 @xmath38 where the values of modal eccentricity amplitudes @xmath39 and the initial phases of the modes @xmath40 are constants determined by projecting the system onto some initial state at time @xmath41 .",
    "in our use of this secular model there are two convenient and complementary formulations of the eigenvalue solution , each with its own advantages .",
    "the modal eccentricity amplitude @xmath42 solution ( above ) clearly identifies the orbital variation of each planet @xmath21 resulting from the coupling with the other planets via mode @xmath43 .",
    "as the orbital elements of a system are its principal dynamical coordinates , this formulation is easily interpreted and can be compared with the results of @xmath18-body simulations ( e.g. ,  using fourier analysis to identify fundamental frequencies and amplitudes ) .",
    "however , this representation of the system s modes tends to mask the structural signature of the eigenvectors and the physical interpretation of a mode s amplitude .",
    "when considering the secular evolution of an isolated system the orbital energies and semimajor axes of the planets are constant and the system angular momentum is conserved .",
    "these two constraints may be combined to identify the so - called angular momentum deficit ( amd ) as an important integral of a secularly evolving system .",
    "the amd is defined as @xmath44 where @xmath21 runs over the planets and @xmath45 is a planet s orbital inclination ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "physically , the amd represents the angular momentum that must be added to the system to make all the planets orbits circular and coplanar . because secular interactions do not alter the semimajor axes of the planets , a system s amd quantifies the amount of angular momentum that is available for exchange between planets via gravitational interactions and limits the amplitude of eccentricity and inclination oscillations of the planets .",
    "the linear secular system can also be formulated with the following transformation of variables and matrix elements : @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where the factor @xmath48 is the square root of a planet s circular orbital angular momentum .",
    "the system s solution is again expressed as a superposition of the modes @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the @xmath43th orthonormal eigenvector and @xmath51 its modal amplitude computed from a set of orbital elements and masses .",
    "the system quantity @xmath52 corresponds to the horizontal component of the system s amd in our secular model .",
    "the secular modal amplitudes @xmath53 are integrals of the system and reveal the fraction of the system amd partitioned into a single mode .",
    "conversion back and forth between the two formulations is easily accomplished using @xmath54    as the mass distribution of a planetary system evolves ( e.g. ,  due to planetary migration , stellar spin down , dispersal of the gaseous nebula , etc . ) , the system s eigenfrequencies , eigenvectors , and modal amplitudes become time - dependent . however , if the dynamical tuning of the system is slow with respect to the eigenfrequencies @xmath55 and the system is not near a secular resonance ( i.e. ,  @xmath56 is not small ) , the variation in mode amplitudes tends to oscillate rapidly and average out ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a complete development ) .",
    "for slow enough changes in the system , the modal amplitudes @xmath53 can be considered as effectively constant .",
    "we exploit this convenient aspect of this formulation when exploring the consequences of secular resonant sweeping during planetary migration .",
    "we have calculated the normal mode solution for the eccentricity evolution of a six - planet system consisting of jupiter and saturn and the terrestrial planets .",
    "uranus and neptune have been omitted from this treatment for simplicity as their influence on jupiter and saturn is weak and not efficiently communicated to the inner solar system .    the system s orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath57 are shown in figure [ fig : e_vects ] with their associated eigenfrequencies ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "as is the convention for the solar system , the eigenmode index ( @xmath43 ) identifies the planet that has the largest component in the eigenvector ( i.e. ,  mercury has the largest component in the @xmath59 mode and its evolution is strongly governed by this mode , venus has the largest component in the @xmath60 mode , etc . ) .",
    "large components for multiple planets in a single eigenvector indicate strong coupling between those planets .",
    "the sign of an eigenvector component ( @xmath61 ) indicates the relative apsidal orientation within the mode , with like signs indicating alignment and opposite signs anti - alignment .",
    "the eigenvectors of this six - planet system can be divided into two groups , those where the terrestrial planets have the largest components ( @xmath62 ) and those where jupiter and saturn have the dominant components ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this trend in the structure of the eigenvectors is indicative of the weak coupling between the terrestrial and giant planets in their current configuration .",

    "the lowest - order mean motion resonances encountered during the divergent migration of jupiter and saturn are the 2:1 and 3:2 . both are first - order resonances and may strongly affect the secular evolution of the planets .",

    "jupiter s semimajor axis was held constant at 5.2 au , the semimajor axis of saturn was increased from just outside the mutual 3:2 mean motion resonance at about 6.8 au , across the 2:1 at 8.25 au , to 9.7 au .    to determine the eigenfrequencies of the jupiter  saturn system as a function of their semimajor axes we performed a set of individual @xmath18-body simulations , each with a different initial semimajor axis for saturn . in each simulation",
    "the planets were assigned nearly circular , nearly coplanar orbits ( i.e. ,  @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) , random phase elements and were evolved for about 11 myr .",
    "the symba integrator @xcite was used in these simulations and the precessional effects of general relativity were included ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we determined the eccentricity amplitudes ( @xmath39 ) and eigenfrequencies of the system by analyzing the evolution of a planet s eccentricity vector @xmath91 using a frequency modified fourier transform code . for each simulation the two frequencies with the largest amplitudes in the evolution of jupiter s eccentricity vector @xmath92 are shown in figure [ fig : fmftg56 ] with gray triangles . the close proximity of the measured frequencies to the eigenfrequencies of the jupiter  saturn system identifies them as the @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "since the @xmath18-body simulations include all gravitational interactions between the planets , resonant , and otherwise , these fmft results serve as `` measurements '' of the apsidal eigenfrequencies of the actual system and can be used to assess the fidelity of more approximate , but analytically tractable , treatments .    as saturn s orbit",
    "is expanded , the values of the @xmath83 and @xmath84 frequencies show two important characteristics .",
    "first , near both the 3:2 and 2:1 mmrs the value of the @xmath84 frequency diverges .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath83 is somewhat different , showing divergence behavior only near the 2:1 mean motion resonance . for orbital separations outside the 2:1 resonance ( i.e.",
    ",  the semimajor axis of saturn greater than 8.25au in this case ) , the two eigenfrequencies decrease as jupiter and saturn continue to diverge .",
    "we have used secular theory to compute the modal frequencies in three different ways .",
    "the standard laplace  lagrange treatment is shown as a gray solid line in both figures .",
    "this treatment contains no information regarding mean longitudes of the planets and fails to account for divergence in the @xmath93 frequencies near the 3:2 and 2:1 mean motion resonances .",

    "the value of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are shown with a dash - dotted line .",
    "the corrections due to the direct terms account for divergence of the @xmath84 frequency when approaching the 3:2 or 2:1 resonances , but fail to account for the changes in the @xmath83 frequency due to the 2:1 resonance .    finally , we compute the apsidal eigenfrequencies using the correction of both direct and indirect terms from the first - order mean motion resonances . the contributions of the indirect terms associated with the 2:1 mmr may be included in the model of @xcite by adding @xmath94 to their equation  ( 26b ) where @xmath95 is the kronecker delta function ( r.  malhotra , private communication 2011 ) . as the 2:1 is the only first - order resonance with indirect terms it is also the only resonance affected by this amended theory .",
    "the inclusion of the indirect terms dramatically improves the agreement between the secular frequencies computed with fmft - measured values and the corrected secular theory and accounts for the behavior of the @xmath83 frequency around the 2:1 mmr .",
    "this model assumes that the resonant argument is rapidly circulating and consequently becomes less accurate near the resonant separatrix where the circulation rate slows .",
    "the continuous behavior of the corrected @xmath83 frequency as the 2:1 mmr is crossed , its inflection and local maxima are model artifacts of these assumptions . for jupiter and saturn",
    "more than @xmath96 au outside the 2:1 mmr resonance , the results of the @xmath18-body simulations and the modified secular theory are in close agreement .",
    "the influence of additional mean motion resonances between jupiter and saturn are also visible in fmft measurements of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "these appear as deviation from the smooth general trends indicated by secular theory .",
    "the effects of the 5:3 and 7:4 mmrs when saturn is near 7.3 and 7.55 au and the 5:2 mmr as saturn approaches its current orbit at 9.54 au are evident .",
    "these second- and third - order resonances are relatively weak compared to the 3:2 and 2:1 and their influence on the eigenfrequencies is both smaller and localized to configurations close to exact resonance .    these results clearly demonstrate that the divergent migration of jupiter and saturn across their 2:1 mmr , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , results in secular resonant sweeping of the @xmath83 across the values of all four of the current terrestrial eigenfrequencies . thus , this migration scenario may subject the terrestrial planets to potentially destabilizing secular resonant perturbations .",
    "excitation via passage through linear secular resonances with the giant planets has been considered previously in several contexts @xcite .",

    "the amplitude of this response is determined by the rate of passage through resonance and is a function of the migration rate .",
    "it is convenient to use an exponentially decaying migration rate of the form @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the distance of the planet from its final semimajor axis ( @xmath128 ) and @xmath129 is the characteristic migration timescale .",
    "we treat @xmath129 as a global migration constant and use this to parameterize migration speed .",
    "we note that equation ( [ eq : adot_tau ] ) can also be used to convert between analytic constraints , that are easily expressed as an exponential timescale ( @xmath129 ) , and migration rates ( @xmath130 ) which might be more easily measured from @xmath18-body simulations of planetary migration . using the exponential migration model , @xmath131 where all terms except the timescale are functions of the planetary masses and semimajor axes at the time of resonance .",
    "this can also be used to identify a critical migration timescale ( @xmath132 ) required to excite the eccentricity to some prescribed value @xmath133 @xmath134 where the mass and orbital state of the perturbing planets are encapsulated in @xmath135 ( see equation ( [ eq : nuj ] ) ) .",
    "if the test particle s free eccentricity prior to resonance passage was zero , then equation ( [ eq : eres ] ) is the new eccentricity after passage of the secular resonance .",

    "there is a reasonable range of migration parameters ( 0.61 myr ) where the constraints on both @xmath244 and @xmath225 can individually be satisfied in @xmath272% of cases .",
    "while our analysis is approximate , it suggests that crossing the 2:1 mmr might produce a state similar to the observed eccentricity partitioning of the @xmath73 and @xmath66 terrestrial modes in @xmath273% of cases with these initial amplitudes and migration parameters .",
    "for eccentricities of jupiter and saturn comparable to their current values as they passed through the @xmath3 and @xmath275 resonances , our secular theory indicates migration parameters @xmath2760.05 myr and 0.7 myr will excite the terrestrial @xmath60 and @xmath59 modes to values larger than the observed ones .",
    "the order of magnitude difference in the critical parameters between these modes is primarily due to the larger width ( @xmath277 ) of the @xmath3 resonance and the smaller amplitude of the @xmath60 mode .",
    "a migration timescale of 0.05 myr is actually _ less _ than the period of the resonant frequency ( @xmath278 myr ) . for such rapid evolution",
    "it is no longer appropriate to consider the secular mode amplitudes @xmath53 as effectively constant during migration .",
    "we again explore the dynamics of passage through these resonances by conducting @xmath18-body simulations of forced giant planet migration with timescales that span the adiabatic secular ( @xmath279 myr ) and non - adiabatic migration ( @xmath280 myr ) regimes .",
    "migration timescales as short as @xmath280 myr are not likely to result from smooth migration driven by the scattering of small bodies by jupiter and saturn .",
    "such rapid migration might result from scattering with other planets or ice giants . in this sense",
    "our use of smooth migration with very short migration timescales may serve as a simple proxy for the rapid non - adiabatic evolution driven by giant planet scattering .",
    "we again isolate the influence of secular resonances by constructing initial conditions where the terrestrial mode amplitudes are very small , the giant planets modal amplitudes are near their present values , jupiter s semimajor axis is fixed at 5.2 au , and saturn s initial semimajor axis of 8.5 au places the @xmath0 frequency between the @xmath161 and @xmath164 frequencies",

    "the terrestrial planets were then added to the system and we conducted a second integration applying slow eccentricity damping to decrease the terrestrial mode amplitudes .",

    "for this cancellation to yield eccentricities near zero , the eccentricity amplitudes from each mode must be comparable .",
    "in agreement with secular theory , the eccentricity amplitudes of mercury , venus , and earth are each driven to values in excess of the present - day values .",
    "mars is only weakly coupled to the other terrestrial planets through the @xmath286 modes ( see figure [ fig : e_vects ] ) and is minimally excited via these resonances .",

    "the component of mercury in the @xmath60 mode ( @xmath295 ) increases while the components of venus and earth ( @xmath296 and @xmath297 ) decrease . in this case , the modest discrepancies in fmft - measured eccentricity amplitude and secular theory in figure [ fig : dekj_g21 ] result from changes in the eigenfrequencies and eigenvector signatures .",
    "we note that these effects become important at eccentricities well above the observed values in the present solar system .    for migration timescales @xmath298 myr",
    ", the entire epoch of migration may occur in less than a precession cycle .",
    "such migration is not slow with respect to the @xmath0 frequency .",
    "since the eccentricity amplitudes of the terrestrial planets were all @xmath210 prior to migration , figure [ fig : dekj_g21 ] shows that rapid non - adiabatic giant planet migration can also contribute to the eccentricity amplitudes and amd in the terrestrial modes . for the @xmath60 mode , the eccentricity amplitudes of @xmath299 , @xmath300 , and @xmath301 for mercury , venus , and earth are systematically achieved and appear independent of the migration timescale .",
    "these values correlate with the planet s distance from the @xmath0 resonance in the present - day solar system and are likely related to the forced eccentricity in the region .",
    "these values are also _ greater _ than the observed values for the @xmath60 eccentricity amplitudes of the terrestrial planets .    for the fastest migration timescale explored above , this change in eccentricity amplitudes results from a single rapid jump from one orbital state of jupiter and saturn to another .",
    "however , giant planet migration due to scattering between the planets would involve several to many stochastic jumps in semimajor axes and modal amplitudes @xcite .",
    "repeated scattering events among the giant planets may induce stochastic and diffusive exchange of amd between the terrestrial and giant planet mode amplitudes .",
    "if the eccentricities shown in figure [ fig : dekj_g21 ] are indicative of the size of the steps , then this type of evolution may also perturb the terrestrial system to eccentricities larger than the observed values . as in the case of slower planetesimal - driven migration , selective cancellation between multiple contributions may be required for the terrestrial planets to emerge from this type of giant planet evolution with an eccentricity state resembling the observed one , even if the initial @xmath69 mode amplitudes are small .",
    "@xcite show an @xmath18-body simulation result that illustrates this type of evolution .",
    "a systematic exploration of the diffusion of amd between the giant and terrestrial planets during an epoch of giant planet scattering is needed to more generally evaluate the influence this style of giant planet migration has on the terrestrial planets .",
    "there is about an order of magnitude difference between the critical migration parameters for the @xmath302 modes ( @xmath303 myr and @xmath304 myr , see table [ tab : secres ] ) with both values shorter than migration timescales suggested for planetesimal - driven migration by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "could cancellation between the resonant contributions yield a dynamical state consistent with the terrestrial planets for migration timescales of 210 myr ? to evaluate this hypothesis we model the addition of multiple contributions to the @xmath305 modes using the monte carlo technique described in section [ sec : interfere ] .",
    "because the @xmath3 and @xmath275 resonances are crossed once during the last @xmath306 au of divergence between jupiter and saturn , the final mode amplitude results from just two contributions , the secular resonant one and the primordial amplitude . when comparing results with the terrestrial planets , we consider `` close '' to the observed dynamical state to mean @xmath307 and @xmath308 for the @xmath60 and @xmath59 modes , respectively . as above , these ranges are somewhat arbitrary , but are comparable to the observed @xmath309 amplitude and within 30% of the observed @xmath310 amplitude .    figure [ fig : e22e11 ] shows the percent of outcomes consistent with the observed @xmath311 and @xmath312 as a function of the migration parameter for several different assumed primordial eccentricity amplitudes .",
    "cancellation can produce systems with @xmath307 for migration parameters larger than the critical one ( see , e.g. ,  figure [ fig : e22e11](a ) ) , but the requisite destructive interference requires primordial and resonant contributions of comparable size . also , the probability of the required cancellation decreases as the size of contributions ( and migration parameter ) increases .",
    "for example , migration parameters of 1 myr contribute a vector of about 0.10 in magnitude to @xmath311 ( see equation  ( [ eq : erscale ] and table [ tab : secres ] ) . combining this with an initial eccentricity amplitude of 0.10 will produce a sufficiently small final value of @xmath311 in @xmath313% of cases .",
    "figure [ fig : e22e11](b ) shows results for the @xmath312 amplitude .",
    "cancellation with an initial @xmath312 amplitude generally broadens the range of migration parameters that are able to produce systems close to the observed state of the terrestrial planets . however , even large initial eccentricities of 0.10 do not permit migration parameters much larger than 1 myr , and are not consistent with migration timescales suggested for planetesimal migration , unless the amplitude of the @xmath180 amplitude is lower than its observed value as these resonances are encountered .",
    "recall that the @xmath18-body simulations with migration timescales @xmath314 myr are fast with respect to the secular timescale .",
    "also for very fast migration the resulting @xmath312 and @xmath311 amplitudes are comparable to those obtained by migration parameters @xmath315 myr .",
    "we use this level of excitation to estimate the minimum forcing expected during instability - driven migration ( i.e. ,  planet - planet scattering ) .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : e22e11 ] shows that for modest initial eccentricity amplitudes ( i.e. ,  @xmath316 ) and fortuitous interference between primordial and resonant contributions , both the large observed value of @xmath312 and the small observed value of @xmath311 might be produced in @xmath317% of cases for migration parameters of @xmath318 myr .",
    "this fast exponential migration modeled here might be thought of as the rapid divergence of jupiter and saturn by a single strong scattering event , or one large jump in semimajor axis to the observed orbit . when jupiter and saturn experience multiple scattering events the forcing of the terrestrial planets may be greater and the success rate in producing the observed state of the inner planets lower .    because the @xmath312 modal amplitude is about an order of magnitude larger than @xmath311 and",
    "both are excited in comparable ways by the sweeping @xmath0 resonance ( see equation  ( [ eq : erscale ] ) , table [ tab : secres ] , and figure [ fig : dekj_g21 ] ) , it is difficult to explain their very different amplitudes as a natural outcome of planetary migration , without invoking strong interference between multiple contributions or additional processes .",
    "using a modified secular theory we have calculated how the @xmath0 and @xmath319 eigenfrequencies of the jupiter  saturn system evolve as these planets diverge from just outside their mutual 3:2 mean motion resonance to their observed orbits .",
    "using the subgroup approximation of @xcite we have identified six secular resonances between the @xmath0 frequency and one of the terrestrial eigenfrequencies @xmath320 during this divergent migration .    based on analytic arguments we combined the jovian eccentricity amplitude ( @xmath180 ) and orbital migration timescale ( @xmath129 ) into a single migration parameter @xmath321 that encapsulates the forcing strength experienced by the terrestrial planets via secular resonances with the @xmath0 frequency .",
    "we used this model to identify the critical values of the migration parameter required to excite the terrestrial eccentricity eigenmodes to their observed amplitudes .",
    "we validated the analytic secular model with @xmath18-body simulations and showed that linear secular models can account for the fundamental character and scaling of the eccentricity excitation experienced by the terrestrial planets via these secular resonances .",
    "we then used this model and the observed modal amplitudes of the terrestrial planets to constrain the migration of jupiter and saturn when these secular resonances were encountered .      to clarify the dominant processes at work ,",
    "we have made a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we have neglected the influence of uranus and neptune .",
    "the distant locations and relatively small mass of the ice giants render them weak perturbers of jupiter and saturn .",
    "their omission from the secular model does not significantly modify the @xmath0 and @xmath319 frequencies of jupiter and saturn or those of the terrestrial planet subsystem ( e.g. ,  @xmath322 ) .",
    "similarly , we have neglected any modification of the system s eigenfrequencies that results from interaction with the planetesimal disk fueling migration . the modification of the @xmath0 and @xmath319 frequencies by the planetesimal disk is a function of the disk mass and location . when considering the late migration of jupiter and saturn , the planetesimal disk must have survived for at least the 30100myr required to form the terrestrial planets .",
    "bodies with orbits near jupiter and saturn have a median dynamical lifetime of about 69 myr .",
    "this suggests that the jupiter  saturn region was largely devoid of planetesimals by the time the terrestrial planets were completely assembled ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a planetesimal disk exterior to jupiter and saturn with mass comparable to that of uranus and neptune ( i.e. ,  @xmath323 ) affects the @xmath0 and @xmath319 frequencies by an amount comparable to that of the ice giant planets and can be similarly neglected .    for rapid migration ( @xmath324 myr ) ,",
    "a large fraction of the planetesimal disk must be on crossing orbits with jupiter and saturn . to roughly estimate the effect of this disk on the giant planet eigenfrequencies we treat it as a single @xmath325 planet between the gas giants .",
    "this increases both the @xmath0 and @xmath319 frequencies by @xmath326% .",
    "however , this contribution decays as migration proceeds and the planetesimal disk is depleted .",
    "we suggest that these deviations in the @xmath0 frequency are not likely to prevent resonances with the terrestrial modes or grossly modify the factors that determine the excitation experienced by the inner planets .    in exploring the problem we held jupiter s semimajor axis constant to reduce the number of model parameters . more generally , the configuration of the planetary system when secular resonances occur depends on the semimajor axes of all the planets .",
    "so , the examples shown and values listed in table [ tab : secres ] are not unique .",
    "self - consistent @xmath18-body simulations of planetesimal - driven migration of the solar system typically show jupiter to migrate inward a few tenths of an au and saturn migrating outward a few au on the same timescale .",
    "we have used the secular analytic model to examine how jupiter s migration affects the planetary configuration where resonances occur and the critical migration parameter for each resonance . considering jupiter with an initial semimajor axis of 5.4 au , saturn starting just outside the 3:2 mmr with jupiter , and both planets migrating to their observed orbits ,",
    "all six of the secular resonances reported in table [ tab : secres ] are encountered , albeit with slightly different values of the planetary semimajor axes , resonant frequencies , and critical migration timescales . while the @xmath327 frequencies are strongly affected by the orbital divergence of jupiter and saturn , the effect of jupiter s inward migration of @xmath2200.2 au on the terrestrial eigenfrequencies ( @xmath1 ) is small and only slightly larger than the effect of saturn s outward migration ( see , e.g. ,  figure  [ fig : gjvsas ] ) .",
    "consequently , the orbital period ratio between saturn and jupiter ( @xmath166 ) at a particular @xmath167 secular resonances is nearly independent of jupiter s semimajor axis , or whether it is migrating .",
    "this allows the period ratio to be used as a single independent variable to identify secular resonances ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for comparison with scenarios where both gas giants are migrating .",
    "further , the secular model shows that the frequency gradient at resonance due to jupiter ( @xmath328 ) is comparable to that of saturn ( @xmath329 ) .",
    "in this situation , the planet with the greater migration rate ( i.e. ,  @xmath330 ) most strongly determines the level of terrestrial excitation and the critical migration parameter ( see equation  ( [ eq : tau_mode ] ) ) . due to its larger",
    "mass jupiter tends to be less mobile and its planetesimal - driven migration rate generically slower than saturn s .",
    "consequently , saturn s migration rate most strongly determines excitation of the inner solar system .",
    "finally , for the cases where jupiter migrates inward a few tenths of an au , the critical migration parameters vary from those listed in table [ tab : secres ] by 20%30% .    in total , the various assumptions we have made to simplify the model and its presentation modestly affect the secular system .",
    "we consider the critical migration parameters listed in table [ tab : secres ] as broadly representative of many plausible migration scenarios suggested for the solar system .      as",
    "jupiter and saturn diverge across their mutual 2:1 mmr they encounter the @xmath4 and @xmath216 secular resonances on both sides of the resonance ( i.e. , for @xmath331 ) . due to several factors , including the small amplitude of the @xmath73 terrestrial mode , the @xmath4 resonances near the 2:1 mmr of jupiter and saturn constrain the giant planet migration parameter to satisfy @xmath332 myr . following the 2:1 crossing ,",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath275 resonances are encountered as jupiter and saturn diverge outside their 2:1 mmr ( when @xmath3332.12.2 , see table [ tab : secres ] ) . in a similar manner",
    "the migration history considered must satisfy @xmath334 myr when @xmath335 and @xmath336 myr when @xmath337 .",
    "we note that greater values of the migration parameters may also produce acceptable states for secular resonances with the terrestrial modes ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "however , achieving agreement with the observed terrestrial system relies on cancellation of multiple contributions ( see , e.g. ,  figures  [ fig : interfere ] and [ fig : dekj_js21 ] ) .",
    "when the magnitudes of all contributions are known , we have shown that the probability of producing a particular eccentricity state can be estimated using analytical arguments ( see  equation  ( [ eq : ef ] ) , figures  [ fig : e33e44 ] and [ fig : e22e11 ] ) .",
    "we have also shown that the probability of yielding the required cancellation between multiple contributions decreases significantly when the critical migration parameter @xmath338 is exceeded by a factor of two to three . with these caveats",
    "we suggest that these values represent characteristic constraints on the migration of jupiter and saturn due to passage through these secular resonances .",
    "further , because the solar system s giant planets migrate as a coupled system , constraints on the migration of jupiter and saturn should be considered as indirect constraints on the formation and migration of uranus and neptune and the evolution of the giant planet system as a whole .",
    "for each @xmath167 secular resonance identified , planetesimal - driven migration of the giant planets ( i.e. ,  @xmath339 myr ) with the jovian eccentricity comparable to the present value would excite the terrestrial system to eccentricities and modal amplitudes well beyond their observed values . the constraints on giant planet migration imposed by these secular resonances and the dynamical structure of the terrestrial planets may be satisfied in several ways .",
    "first , if the giant planets migrated with eccentricity amplitudes comparable to their present day values the strong forcing of the terrestrial planets via the secular resonances may have interfered destructively with an initial amplitude of the @xmath62 modes ( e.g. ,  from the accretion epoch ) .",
    "this could deposit the terrestrial planets in a dynamical state similar to the observed one .",
    "the general scenario requires the cancellation of two large components and we have shown that this is accordingly of low probability ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    using the resonant excitation model and geometric arguments we can identify additional constraints required on this type of evolution . for cancellation to be viable",
    ", the initial and resonant contributions must be of a similar size and the excitation from resonance crossing necessarily less than an amount that would render the terrestrial subsystem unstable .",
    "for the @xmath4 and @xmath216 secular resonances encountered near the 2:1 mmr , the terrestrial planets are driven to crossing orbits if the migration timescale of jupiter and saturn is @xmath340myr and the @xmath180 has the present - day value . for the @xmath3 and @xmath275 resonances , @xmath341myr leads to crossing orbits and instabilities ( see , e.g. ,  figure  [ fig : jsa21_tau1e6 ] ) .",
    "this latter constraint indicates that planetesimal - driven migration through the @xmath207 secular resonances is not viable unless the jovian eccentricity amplitude @xmath180 is significantly smaller than the observed value .",
    "second , if the jovian eccentricity ( @xmath180 ) was smaller during migration , then longer timescales might be permissible .",
    "for @xmath342 myr , the @xmath4 secular resonance constrains the jovian eccentricity amplitude @xmath343 , or about a quarter of the current value , when jupiter and saturn migrated across the 2:1 mmr .",
    "this eccentricity is comparable to those typical of models of planetesimal - driven migration .",
    "however , since it is less than the observed @xmath344 value it also requires that the @xmath178 mode amplitude be excited later via some other process .",
    "@xcite examined the origin of the @xmath178 mode amplitude in detail and found that repeated planet ",
    "planet scattering between jupiter or saturn and an ice giant planet may explain the observed @xmath178 amplitude and account for its excitation via an instability in the giant planets orbits after the 2:1 mmr of jupiter and saturn is crossed .",
    "this analytic result is consistent with the numerical simulations of @xcite and the conclusions drawn from them . using the secular model we have also shown for initial eccentricity amplitudes @xmath269 and @xmath345 the eccentricity partitioning of the @xmath73 and @xmath66",
    "terrestrial modes can be expected with a roughly 25% probability for migration parameters in the range @xmath3460.61.0 myr .",
    "again , these values are broadly consistent with those of planetesimal - driven migration .",
    "when examining the @xmath3 and @xmath275 resonances , a jovian modal eccentricity amplitude of @xmath347 is required to allow a planetesimal - driven migration timescale of @xmath348myr through these resonances without exciting the @xmath60 terrestrial mode amplitude beyond its observed value .",
    "this value of @xmath180 is quite small , and again requires the late excitation of the jovian eccentricity ( e.g. ,  via scattering with a @xmath349 body to excite the @xmath178 amplitude during the last 0.50.8 au of divergent migration between jupiter and saturn ; * ? ? ?",
    "third , rapid , stochastic migration in large steps in semimajor axis is also possible when the system of planets is unstable and planet  planet scattering ensues .",
    "such global instabilities may allow secular resonances to be jumped over and the whole migration epoch to be much shorter than suggested by planetesimal - driven migration . .",
    "if such rapid migration was driven by scattering between planets , this process must cause the orbits of jupiter and saturn to diverge . for saturn to move outward",
    "it must scatter an ice giant inward .",
    "similarly for jupiter to move inward , it must scatter an ice giant outward .",
    "this style of instability - driven migration might allow the @xmath0 and @xmath319 secular resonances to move quickly through the inner solar system .",
    "@xmath18-body simulations of this process by @xcite suggest that it is possible that the terrestrial planets might emerge from this style of planet migration with orbits comparable to their observed ones .    on the other hand ,",
    "our simulations with very fast migration ( @xmath350 myr ) indicate that the @xmath60 terrestrial mode can be excited to amplitudes in excess of the observed values . if the @xmath178 mode amplitude originated via repeated planet",
    " planet scattering @xcite it appears plausible that instability - driven giant planet migration may perturb the terrestrial planets to an overly excited state . in this regard , additional work assessing the relative frequency of characteristic outcomes ( e.g. ,  those similar to the observed state ) would be welcome .",
    "finally , if planetary migration was rapid as suggested by the constraints of these secular resonances ( @xmath351510 myr ) , then entire epoch of giant planet formation and migration , could have been largely complete before terrestrial planet accretion was finished . in this case the dynamical structure of the inner solar system was determined later ( e.g. ,  by processes related to accretion and evolution ) and the formation timescale of the terrestrial planets ( i.e. ,  30100 myr ) constrains the timing by which giant planet formation and migration was largely complete .",
    "recently , have investigated the effect of the early planetesimal - driven migration of jupiter and saturn on terrestrial planet formation .",
    "their @xmath18-body accretion simulations with a migration timescale of @xmath352 myr for jupiter and saturn produce terrestrial planet systems with amds comparable to the observed terrestrial planets .",
    "while several open problems of terrestrial planet formation persist in these simulations ( e.g. ,  explaining the small mass of mars and the clearing and dynamical structure of the asteroid belt ) , these results suggest that effects of the sweeping @xmath0 resonance through the terrestrial region may be tempered by terrestrial accretion dynamics .      in the nice model explanation of the lhb @xcite , an instability among the giant planets",
    "is initiated by jupiter and saturn crossing their mutual 2:1 mmr .",
    "this instability may be delayed by the very slow divergent migration of jupiter and saturn of a few tenths of an au toward the 2:1 mmr over 600700 myr .",
    "this slow migration roughly corresponds to exponential migration timescales of @xmath353yr .",
    "the secular resonant model presented here predicts that crossing the @xmath4 and @xmath216 resonances this slowly requires the jovian eccentricity amplitude @xmath354 to leave the terrestrial planets in a state comparable to the observed one .",
    "a modestly larger jovian eccentricity ( @xmath355 ) may perturb the terrestrial planets to crossing orbits and drive a global instability of the terrestrial system .",
    "requiring such small values of the jovian eccentricity is a very strong constraint on the evolution of the gas giants and we interpret this as an indication that the slow divergent migration of jupiter and saturn toward the 2:1 mmr is not generally consistent with the coexistence and dynamical structure of the terrestrial planets . as a result , the specific lhb initiating scenario described in @xcite appears unlikely . @xcite",
    "have drawn similar conclusions based on the results of @xmath18-body simulations .",
    "if the lhb resulted from the large scale migration of the giant planets , then an instability and giant planet scattering may be required to avoid strongly perturbing the terrestrial planets via secular resonances @xcite .",
    "alternate modes of triggering a late instability ( e.g. ,  uranus and neptune s divergent migration across a mean motion resonance ) are possible and may offer viable alternative modes of initiating the lhb @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath356 mode of jupiter and saturn has components in terrestrial planets comparable to those of @xmath69 terrestrial modes ( see , e.g. ,  table  [ tab : eij ] ) .",
    "if giant planet scattering is responsible for exciting the @xmath356 mode amplitude to the observed value , then this excitation may also be communicated to the terrestrial planets ( e.g. ,  stochastic diffusion of amd between @xmath356 mode and the terrestrial @xmath594 modes ) .",
    "our simulations of very fast migration ( i.e. ,  @xmath357 myr ) suggest that excitation of the terrestrial planets via this process is likely , but more work to examine the net exchange of amd between the terrestrial and giant planet systems is needed to assess the dynamical implications of instability - driven giant planet migration for the terrestrial planets .",
    "we have shown that if the terrestrial planets witnessed an epoch when the gross orbital structure of the giant planets changed , then the dynamical structure of the inner solar system was likely altered . in this scenario ,",
    "the ultimate dynamical state of the terrestrial planets is a product of several processes ( e.g. ,  accretion dynamics , passage through secular resonances , amd diffusion via giant - planet scattering , and chaotic diffusion of the system s amd over long timescales ) that act in concert and whose individual influences are challenging to isolate and disentangle .",
    "the small amplitudes of the @xmath69 terrestrial eigenmodes , that are closely associated with the small eccentricities of earth and venus , provide strong constraints on the migration of jupiter and saturn . while more work examining the characteristic forcing of the terrestrial planets by instability - driven migration is needed , explaining the observed dynamical state of the terrestrial planets as a natural and frequent outcome of the late migration of the giant planets remains a challenge .",
    "an alternate and perhaps simpler possibility is that giant planet formation and migration was largely complete before the dynamical structure of the inner solar system was determined .",
    "formation models and isotopic evidence suggest that terrestrial planet accretion was complete in 30100 myr .",
    "the bulk of giant planet migration could easily be accommodated in shorter time intervals via some combination of tidal interaction with a gas disk , planet  planet scattering , and planetesimal - driven migration .",
    "any strong perturbation of the inner solar system resulting from giant planet migration might then be tempered through a variety of processes that depend on the state of the forming planets and the protoplanetary disk at the time of the disturbance .",
    "additional mechanisms that may act at this earlier time include dynamical friction with a disk of planetesimals , orbital damping due to interactions with a remnant gas disk , or a combination of dynamical processes @xcite .    in the sequential accretion scenario , the formation timescale for giant planet cores ( @xmath358 ) in the outer regions of a minimum mass nebula appear to be considerably longer than the observationally inferred depletion timescale of protostellar disks .",
    "ice giant formation at smaller orbital radii ( and shorter orbital periods ) is often invoked to overcome this problem , but requires the subsequent outward migration of the ice giant planets .",
    "however , it is also possible that disk gaps near jupiter and saturn s orbits may have provided migration barriers which eventually led to the accumulation of planet - building materials and the emergence of uranus and neptune within a few million years ( see section [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the resonant structure of the kuiper belt is often interpreted as a product of planetesimal - driven or instability - driven migration @xcite of the giant planets .",
    "however , the giant planets outward migration may also be induced by their tidal interaction with a viscously expanding gaseous nebula @xcite or by a disk which is undergoing photoevaporation . in these cases",
    ", giant planet migration may be mostly complete in @xmath22010 myr and could predate the final assembly of the terrestrial planets .",
    "such an early migration scenario would avoid the excitation of the terrestrial planets eccentricities .",
    "this contingency requires that the delivery of lhb impactors to the moon be achieved after the formation , large - scale migration , and/or global orbital restructuring of the giant planets . within the context of the nice model migration scenarios , only explaining the lhb requires that the bulk of giant migration occurred late .",
    "if giant planet migration was completed before the dynamical state of the inner solar system was determined , other aspects of the nice model remain viable ( e.g. ,  the capture of jupiter s trojans and the orbital properties of the giant planets ) .",
    "obviously , the delivery of the lhb impactors must then be accounted for via some other means ( e.g. ,  the planet v hypothesis described in * ? ? ?",
    "additional progress in unraveling the sequence of events and processes that produced the observed solar system might be made by examining the formation and early evolution of the gas and ice giant planets .",
    "we note that the nature and details of gas and ice giant formation in the solar system remain poorly understood . the basic assumptions and initial conditions of current migration models ( e.g. ,  that jupiter and saturn formed in a much more compact configuration ) may change as the formation and early history of the giant planets are clarified .",
    "finally , we note that migration near and through mean motion resonances is germane to the orbital evolution of planetary systems .",
    "consequently , the resonant sweeping processes examined here have applications among extrasolar planetary systems , satellite systems , and other dynamical characteristics of the solar system .",
    "analyses of these applications will be presented elsewhere .",
    "this work has been supported by nasa ( nng05g1496 , nnx07a - l13 g , nnx07ai88 g , nnx08al41 g , and nnx08am84 g ) , and the nsf ( ast-0908807 ) .",

    "<S> we examine how the late divergent migration of jupiter and saturn may have perturbed the terrestrial planets . using a modified secular model we have identified six secular resonances between the @xmath0 frequency of jupiter and saturn and the four apsidal eigenfrequencies of the terrestrial planets ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytic upper limits on the eccentricity and orbital migration timescale of jupiter and saturn when these resonances were encountered to avoid perturbing the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets to values larger than the observed ones . because of the small amplitudes of the @xmath2 terrestrial eigenmodes the @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonances provide the strongest constraints on giant planet migration . </S>",
    "<S> if jupiter and saturn migrated with eccentricities comparable to their present day values , smooth migration with exponential timescales characteristic of planetesimal - driven migration ( @xmath5myr ) would have perturbed the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets to values greatly exceeding the observed ones . </S>",
    "<S> this excitation may be mitigated if the eccentricity of jupiter was small during the migration epoch , migration was very rapid ( e.g. , @xmath6myr perhaps via planetplanet scattering or instability - driven migration ) or the observed small eccentricity amplitudes of the @xmath2 terrestrial modes result from low probability cancellation of several large amplitude contributions . </S>",
    "<S> results of orbital integrations show that very short migration timescales ( @xmath7 myr ) , characteristic of instability - driven migration , may also perturb the terrestrial planets eccentricities by amounts comparable to their observed values . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these constraints for the relative timing of terrestrial planet formation , giant planet migration , and the origin of the so - called late heavy bombardment of the moon @xmath8 ga ago . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the simplest way to satisfy these dynamical constraints may be for the bulk of any giant planet migration to be complete in the first 30 - 100myr of solar system history . </S>"
