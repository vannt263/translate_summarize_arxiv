    "* a. * we consider the case of multilayer graphene with interlayer hopping @xmath30 .",
    "it is convenient to separate the low energy and high energy subspaces by writing the hamiltonian in the @xmath78 basis .",
    "the schrodinger equation in this basis becomes @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the energy eigenvalue , @xmath81 is a two component spinor , @xmath82 is a @xmath83 component spinor , @xmath84 is a 2x2 zero matrix and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are 2 @xmath87(2n-2 ) and ( 2n-2)@xmath87(2n-2 ) matrices respectively . here",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 have the form below @xmath88 @xmath89 we can eliminate the high energy dimer components in the system of equations ( [ eq : h1 ] ) to get a schrodinger equation for only the low energy components in the manner of @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in only the low energy states , we make a binomial expansion to the first order in @xmath80 assuming it is very small compared to @xmath86 .",
    "we get @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "this leads to a low energy single particle hamiltonian for the surface states of an @xmath0 layer graphene which takes the form @xmath32    * b. * first , we calculate the matrix elements of the external potential @xmath92 coming from the bn between bloch states , @xmath93 .",
    "this is just equivalent to calculating the fourier transform of the bn potential .",
    "we model the bn potential as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 are the positions of boron atoms and @xmath96 are the positions of nitrogen atoms .",
    "this is a natural model , since the atomic numbers of @xmath14 and @xmath0 are one less than and one more than carbon respectively . taking the delta functions to have slightly different weights",
    "will not qualitatively alter our results .",
    "the boron atoms sit on the a sublattice of the hexagonal superlattice , and the nitrogen atoms sit on the b sublattice .",
    "the fourier transform of the above potential takes the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes a reciprocal lattice vector of the bn lattice ( which is equal to @xmath99 in eq.[eq : b12 ] of the main text modulo reciprocal lattice vectors of the graphene lattice ) and @xmath100 is a form factor coming from the two site nature of the bn unit cell . for the model potential under consideration , @xmath101 .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "thus far we have assumed that the bn superlattice potential can be modelled as a delta function array .",
    "in fact , the b and n atoms carry @xmath106 and @xmath107 charge respectively . the bn superlattice potential may thus be better modelled as a delta function array convolved with a @xmath108 envelope .",
    "the @xmath108 envelope simply reflects the coulomb potential arising from a local charge imbalance .",
    "this fourier transforms to a delta function array multiplied by a @xmath109 envelope .",
    "thus intervalley scattering by @xmath110 reciprocal lattice vectors is weaker than intravalley scattering by one reciprocal lattice vector by a factor of @xmath49 .",
    "however as we will see below , this weak intervalley scattering is still important along lines in the reduced zone where the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands are degenerate .",
    "now we calculate the band structure .",
    "first we consider the low energy hamiltonian of multilayer graphene without bn substrate in eq.[eq6 ] .",
    "it is written in a basis such that ( 1 , 0 ) is a bloch state in the a sublattice of the top layer and ( 0 , 1 ) is a bloch state in the b sublattice of the bottom layer .",
    "now we consider the case of multilayer graphene sandwiched between bn sheets . without considering the folding of the bands at the reduced zone edges , the 4 low energy bands corresponding to a particular hexagonal unit cell with center @xmath98 are found from the eigenvalues of @xmath111 where @xmath112 points to the @xmath3 point of the hexagon , for which the distance between @xmath113 and @xmath112 is the minimum .",
    "a similar definition holds for @xmath114 and @xmath4 point .",
    "the matrix is written in a basis where @xmath115 denotes a state on sub lattice a and with valley @xmath3 , ( 0,1,0,0 ) denotes a state on sub lattice @xmath14 and valley @xmath3 , @xmath116 denotes a state on sub lattice a and valley @xmath4 and @xmath117 denotes a state on sub lattice b and valley @xmath4 . in the off diagonal blocks we have included a weak inter - valley scattering coming from the superlattice potential .",
    "the band folding at the zone edges can be taken into account by considering the four low energy bands arising from a central hexagonal unit cell in the reciprocal space and those arising from it s 6 nearest neighbouring cells .",
    "the corresponding band structure is easily found from the eigenvalues of the following @xmath118 matrix : @xmath119 where @xmath120 points to the center of the central hexagon , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 point to the centers of the 6 adjoining hexagons .",
    "the matrix is written in a basis where @xmath127 is a state near @xmath128 , @xmath129 is a state near @xmath130 , @xmath131 is a state near @xmath132 etc .",

    "<S> the primitive lattice vectors corresponding to the reciprocal lattice are @xmath48 the strong superlattice potential is seen primarily by states on the lower surface of the multilayer graphene , close to the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> these states are either conduction band or valence band states , depending on the sign of the vertical electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the electric field is chosen such that it is the conduction band that mainly sees the superlattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> if the multilayer graphene were sandwiched between bn sheets , then both conduction and valence bands would see a strong superlattice potential , irrespective of the sign of electric field .    </S>",
    "<S> the reduced ` brillouin zone ' for the superlattice is hexagonal , but scaled by a factor @xmath49 with respect to the original brillouin zone . if z is chosen such that @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 , where @xmath52 then the ` flat pockets ' at @xmath3 and @xmath4 extend over the entire reduced brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , umklapp scattering at the boundaries of the reduced brillouin zone opens a gap between the flat pocket and the rest of the band . </S>",

    "<S> we now explicitly calculate the bandstructure in the reduced zone . </S>",
    "<S> it may be readily determined that for the above superlattice potential , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 points in the original zone get folded to inequivalent corners @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the reduced zone . meanwhile , the reciprocal lattice vectors of the superlattice satisfy @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the width of the flat pocket . since </S>",
    "<S> bragg scattering is only effective between states that are near degenerate , we restrict our attention to bragg scattering by a single reciprocal lattice vector , and neglect higher order bragg scattering events . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements of the superlattice potential @xmath59 were determined by modelling the bn superlattice as a positive @xmath60-function potential at each b site and a negative @xmath60-function potential at each @xmath0 site @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence we obtained the bandstructure in the reduced zone . </S>",
    "<S> although the bandstructure contains @xmath61 conduction bands per spin and valley , only the lowest conduction band is flat , and is separated from the higher bands by an energy scale of order @xmath54 , where the gap may be estimated from the dft calculations in @xcite , and is of order @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the bandgap @xmath63 between conduction and valence bands can be externally controlled using gates , and may be made as large as desired . </S>",
    "<S> we should take @xmath64 to ensure that we do not mix conduction and valence bands . for specificity , we suggest using @xmath65 , which is easily achievable by gating @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the superlattice potential from the bn substrate also introduces intervalley tunneling of magnitude @xmath66 @xcite , which turns the bandcrossings of the two nearly flat bands coming from @xmath3 and @xmath4 valleys into avoided crossings . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting bandstructure contains two strictly non - degenerate flat conduction bands , separated by a minigap @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest energy band comes mostly from the @xmath3 valley in regions closest to the @xmath55 corner of the reduced zone , and comes mostly from the @xmath4 valley in regions closest to the @xmath56 corner . from the bandstructure calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we can extract the bandwidth of the two low - lying conduction bands . </S>",
    "<S> in fig.[fig4 ] , we plot the bandwidth of the lowest conduction band as a function of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that for @xmath11 the two low - lying conduction bands are nearly flat , with a small residual bandwidth around @xmath68 mev which comes mainly from umklapp scattering at the zone boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 layer system actually has minimum bandwidth of @xmath2 mev , due to a cancellation between ` intrinsic ' curvature of the band and the effect of umklapp scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> we also note that there is an indirect band gap separating the two flat bands from the higher energy non - flat bands . </S>",
    "<S> it vanishes for @xmath69 and then decreases with increasing @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> transitions across the indirect band - gap must be phonon assisted and should be weak , but nevertheless it is essential that we work with @xmath11 to have a truly isolated flat band . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , @xmath1 is optimal not only through having the flattest band ( fig.[fig4 ] ) , but also because its indirect band gap is of order the direct band gap . for @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the direct band gap is @xmath70 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have now verified that the lowest conduction band can be made flat . </S>",
    "<S> now we show that this band has non - vanishing berry curvature . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum - space berry curvature for the @xmath71th band is given by @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the velocity operator and @xmath74 is the eigenenergy corresponding to the @xmath75 eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> it may be readily determined that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands have opposite signs of local berry curvature . </S>",
    "<S> the conduction and valence bands also have opposite signs of local berry curvature at every point in momentum space . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> when the chemical potential is placed between conduction and valence bands , the system displays quantum valley hall effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , flat band physics will manifest itself when the chemical potential is placed inside either the conduction or the valence bands . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we can focus on the band that contains the chemical potential .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the conduction band for specificity . </S>",
    "<S> due to avoided crossings between bands coming from the two valleys , the lowest conduction band contains regions with positive and negative local berry curvature respectively while the integrated berry curvature ( chern number ) is zero ( fig.[fig : curvature ] ) . meanwhile </S>",
    "<S> , there is a second nearly flat conduction band which is separated by a mini gap equal to the inter valley scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> interactions may enhance this minigap , lifting the near degeneracy of the two conduction bands to gain exchange energy , in accordance with ` quantum hall ferromagnetism ' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that placing @xmath1 layer abc graphene on bn substrate allows us to realize two nearly flat bands with local berry curvature but zero chern number which are separated from the non - flat bands by a band gap of @xmath76 and are separated from each other by a minigap of @xmath77 , equal to the inter valley scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> chiral multilayer graphene thus offers a promising playground for investigating the effect of strong interactions in the presence of a non - trivial quantum distance metric .    </S>",
    "<S> _ chern number from adatoms_. the key feature of chiral multilayer graphene is that it allows access to a system with a non - trivial quantum geometry but without chern number . </S>",
    "<S> however , a non - zero chern number may also be obtained by making use of adatom deposition on the outermost graphene layers to open up a gap between conduction and valence bands , rather than using vertical electric field . </S>",
    "<S> adatom deposition also introduces a superlattice potential . for the appropriate choice of ( time reversal symmetry breaking ) adatoms , the two valleys acquire the same sign of berry curvature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the analysis proceeds exactly as before , only now the berry curvature has the same sign everywhere in the flat band , and thus does not cancel . _ </S>",
    "<S> concluding remarks_. we have shown that abc stacked multilayer graphene placed on bn substrate has a bandstructure containing flat bands . </S>",
    "<S> the seven layer system is ideal for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> the flat bands have nonzero local berry curvature but zero chern number . </S>",
    "<S> thus , chiral multilayer graphene represents an exciting new frontier in the study of interaction effects in systems with non - trivial quantum geometry , allowing access to an interaction dominated system with a non - trivial quantum distance metric but without the complication of a non - zero chern number . </S>",
