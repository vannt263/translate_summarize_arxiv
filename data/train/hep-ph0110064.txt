    "the quantum mechanical description of neutrino oscillations  @xcite has been the subject of much discussion and debate in the recent literature .",

    "@xmath6 is derived on the assumption of equal momentum at production of the two neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "other authors have proposed , instead , equal energies  @xcite or velocities  @xcite at production , confirming , in both cases , the result of the standard formula .",
    "the latter reference claims , however , that the standard expression for @xmath7 should be multiplied by a factor of two in the case of the equal energy or equal momentum hypotheses",
    ". however , the equal momentum , energy or velocity assumptions are all incompatible with energy - momentum conservation in the neutrino production process  @xcite .",
    "in two recent calculations  @xcite a covariant formalism was used in which exact energy - momentum conservation was imposed . using the invariant feynman propagator  @xcite to describe the space - time evolution of the neutrino mass eigenstates , the author of ref .",
    "@xcite also found an oscillation phase a factor of two larger than given by the the standard formula .",
    "however , on convoluting the transition amplitude with a gaussian wavefunction descibing the spatial - temporal position of the source pion , the standard result was recovered . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a completely different formula was obtained for the neutrino oscillation phase following pion decay and it was predicted that only correlated oscillations of neutrinos and the recoiling decay muons could be observed .",
    "however , the author of ref .",
    "@xcite as well as others  @xcite claimed that muon oscillations would either be completely suppressed , or essentially impossible to observe .",
    "the present paper calculates the probabilities of oscillation of neutrinos and muons produced by pions decaying both at rest and in flight , as well as the probabilities of neutrino oscillation following muon decay or @xmath8decay of a nucleus at rest .",
    "the calculations , which are fully covariant , are based on feynman s reformulation of quantum mechanics  @xcite in terms of interfering amplitudes associated with classical space - time particle trajectories .",
    "the essential interpretational formula of this approach , though motivated by the seminal paper of dirac on the lagrangian formulation of quantum mechanics  @xcite , and much developed later in the work of feynman and other authors  @xcite , was actually already given by heisenberg in 1930  @xcite .",
    "the application of the path amplitude formalism to neutrino or muon oscillations is particularly staightforward , since , in the covariant formulation of quantum mechanics , energy and momentum are exactly conserved at all vertices and due to the macroscopic propagation distances of the observed neutrinos and muons all these particles follow essentially classical trajectories ( _ i.e. _ corresponding to the minima of the classical action ) which are rectilinear paths with constant velocities .",
    "the essential formula of feynman s version of quantum mechanics , to be employed in the calculations presented below , is  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the probability to observe a final state @xmath11 , given an initial state @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are ( unobserved ) intermediate quantum states . in the applications to be described in this paper , eqn(1.2 )",
    "specialises to : @xmath14 for the case of neutrino oscillations and @xmath15 for the case of muon oscillations .",
    "@xmath16 is the probability to observe the charged current neutrino interaction : @xmath17 following the decay : @xmath18 , while @xmath19 is the probability to observe the decay @xmath20 , after the same decay process . in eqns.(1.3),(1.4 ) @xmath21 are neutrino mass eigenstates while @xmath22 are the corresponding recoil muon states from pion decay .",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote invariant decay amplitudes , @xmath26 is the invariant amplitude of the charged current neutrino interaction , @xmath27 is the invariant space - time propagator of particle @xmath28 between the space - time points @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 is an invariant amplitude describing the production of the @xmath32 by the source @xmath33 and its space - time propagation to the space - time point @xmath34 .",
    "the difference of the approach used in the present paper to previous calculations presented in the literature can be seen immediately on inspection of eqns(1.3 ) and ( 1.4 ) .",
    "the initial state contributes only a multiplicative constant to the transition probabilites .",
    "the initial state can then just as well be defined as ` pion at @xmath34 ' , rather than @xmath35 .",
    "this is done in the calculations presented in section 2 below . ]",
    "is a pion at space time - point @xmath34 , the final state an @xmath36 or @xmath37 produced at space - time point @xmath38 .",
    "these are unique points , for any given event and do not depend in any way on the masses of the unobserved neutrino eigenstates propagating from @xmath39 to @xmath38 in eqn(1.3 ) . on the other hand the ( unobserved ) space - time points @xmath39 at which the neutrinos and muons are produced _ do _ depend on @xmath40 . indeed , because of the different velocities of the propagating neutrino eigenstates , only in this case can both neutrinos and muons ( representing _ alternative _ classical histories of the decaying pion ) both arrive simultanously at the unique point @xmath38 where the neutrino interaction occurs ( eqn(1.3 ) ) or the muon decays ( eqn(1.4 ) ) .",
    "the crucial point in the above discussion is that the decaying pion , _ via _ the different path amplitudes in eqns(1.3 ) and ( 1.4 ) , _ interferes with itself_. to modify very slightly dirac s famous statement : ` each pion then interferes only with itself .",
    "interference between two different pions never occurs ' . as will be seen in the discussion in section 5 below ,",
    "essentially all recent treatments of neutrino oscillations in the literature have attempted to contradict the second sentence in dirac s statement !    because of the different possible decay times of the pion in the two interfering path amplitudes , the pion propagators @xmath41 in eqns(1.3 ) and ( 1.4 ) above give important contributions to the interference phase . to the author s best knowledge ,",
    "this effect has not been taken into account in any previously published calculation of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the results found for the oscillation phase are , for pion decays at rest : @xmath42 and for pion decays in flight : @xmath43 where @xmath44 the superscripts indicate the particles whose propagators contribute to the interference phase .",
    "also @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the energies of the parent @xmath48 and the decay @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 the angles between the pion and the neutrino , muon flight directions . in eqns.(1.5 ) to ( 1.7 ) terms of order @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and higher , are neglected , and in eqns.(1.6 ) and ( 1.7 ) ultrarelativistic kinematics with @xmath55 is assumed .",
    "formulae for the oscillation phase of neutrino oscillations following muon decays or nuclear @xmath0-decays at rest , calculated in a similar manner to eqn(1.5 ) , are given in section 3 below .",
    "a brief comment is now made on the generality and the covariant nature of the calculations presented in this paper .",
    "although the fundamental formula ( 1.2 ) is valid in both relativistic and non - relativistic quantum mechanics , it was developed in detail by feynman  @xcite only for the non - relativistic case .",
    "for the conditions of the calculations performed in the present paper ( propagation of particles in free space ) the invariant space - time propagator can either be derived ( for fermions ) from the dirac equation , as originally done by feynman  @xcite or , more generally , from the covariant feynman path integral for an arbitary massive particle , as recently done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter case",

    ", the hankel function reduces to an exponential and yields the configuration space propagator @xmath67 of eqn(2.11 ) below .",
    "it is also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that energy and momentum is exactly conserved in the interactions and decays of all such ` asymptotically propagating ' particles .",
    "the use of quasi - classical particle trajectories and the requirement of exact energy - momentum conservation are crucial ingredients of the calculations presented below .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the following section the case of neutrino or muon oscillations following pion decay at rest",
    "is treated .",
    "full account is taken of the momentum wave - packets of the progagating neutrinos and muons resulting from the breit - wigner amplitudes describing the distributions of the physical masses of the decaying pion and daughter muon .",
    "the corresponding oscillation damping corrections and phase shifts are found to be very small , indicating that the quasi - classical ( constant velocity ) approximation used to describe the neutrino and muon trajectories is a very good one .",
    "the incoherent effects , of random thermal motion of the source pion , and of finite source and detector sizes , on the oscillation probabilities and the oscillation phases , are also calculated .",
    "these corrections are found to be small in typical experiments , but much larger than those generated by the coherent momentum wave packets . in section 3 , formulae are derived to describe neutrino oscillations following muon decay at rest or the @xmath0-decay of radioacive nuclei . these are written down by direct analogy with those derived in the previous section for pion decay at rest . in section 4 ,",
    "the case of neutrino and muon oscillations following pion decay in flight is treated . in this case",
    "the two - dimensional spatial geometry of the particle trajectories must be related to the decay kinematics of the production process . due to the non - applicability of the ultrarelativistic approximation to the kinematics of the muon in the pion rest frame , the calculation , although straightforward , is rather tedious and lengthy for the case of muon oscillations , so the details are relegated to an appendix .",
    "finally , in section 5 , the positive aspects and shortcomings of previous treatments in the literature of the quantum mechanics of neutrino and muon oscillations are discussed in comparison with the method and results of the present paper .",
    "to understand clearly the different physical hypotheses and approximations underlying the calculation of the particle oscillation effects it is convenient to analyse a precise experiment .",
    "this ideal experiment is , however , very similar to lnsd  @xcite and karmen  @xcite except that neutrinos are produced from pion , rather than muon , decay at rest .",
    "the different space - time events that must be considered in order to construct the probability amplitudes for the case of neutrino oscillations following pion decay at rest are shown in fig.1 .",
    "a @xmath32 passes through the counter c@xmath68 , where the time @xmath69 is recorded , and comes to rest in a thin stopping target t ( fig.1a ) ) . for simplicity ,",
    "the case of only two neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath70 and @xmath71 of masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath3 @xmath72 @xmath4 ) is considered .",
    "the pion at rest constitutes the initial state of the quantum mechanical probability amplitudes .",
    "the final state is an @xmath73 system produced , at time @xmath74 , via the process @xmath75 at a distance @xmath2 from the decaying @xmath32 ( fig.1d ) ) .",
    "two different physical processes may produce the observed @xmath73 final state , as shown in fig.1b ) and 1c ) , where the pion decays either at time @xmath76 into @xmath70 or at time @xmath77 into @xmath71 .",
    "the probability amplitudes for these processes are , up to an arbitary normalisation constant : @xmath78 note that following the conventional ` @xmath79 ' ( final , initial ) ordering of the indices of matrix elements in quantum mechanics , the path amplitude is written from right to left in order of increasing time .",
    "this ensures also correct matching of ` bra ' and ` ket ' symbols in the amplitudes . in eqn(2.1 ) , @xmath80 , @xmath81 are the invariant amplitudes of the @xmath82 charged current scattering and pion decay processes , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 are relativistic breit - wigner amplitudes , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are amplitudes describing the mixture of the flavour and mass neutrino eigenstates , and @xmath89 is the lorentz - invariant configuration space propagator  @xcite of the pion or neutrino .",
    "the pole masses and total decay widths of the pion and muon are denoted by @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 respectively . for simplicity ,",
    "phase space factors accounting for different observed final states are omitted in eqn(2.1 ) and subsequent formulae .    because the amplitudes and propagators in eqn(2.1 ) are calculated using relativistic quantum field theory , and the neutrinos propagate over macroscopic distances , it is a good approximation , as already discussed in the previous section , to assume exact energy - momentum conservation in the pion decay process , and that the neutrinos are on their mass shells ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the neutrino energy - momentum four - vector . in these circumstances",
    "the neutrino propagators correspond to classical , rectilinear , particle trajectories .",
    "the pion and muon are unstable particles whose physical masses @xmath96 and @xmath97 differ from the pole masses @xmath98 and @xmath92 appearing in the breit - wigner amplitudes and covariant space - time propagators in eqn(2.1 ) .",
    "the neutrino momentum @xmath99 will depend on these physical masses according to the relation : @xmath100[w_{\\pi}^2-(m_i - w_{\\mu(i)})^2 ] \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } }         { 2 w_{\\pi}}\\ ] ]    note that , because the initial state pion is the same in the two path amplitudes in eqn(2.1 ) @xmath96 does not depend on the neutrino mass index @xmath12 .",
    "however , since the pion decays resulting in the production of @xmath70 and @xmath71 are independent physical processes , the physical masses of the unobserved muons , @xmath101 , recoiling against the two neutrino mass eigenstates are not , in general , the same . in the following kinematical calculations sufficient accuracy",
    "is achieved by retaining only quadratic terms in the neutrino masses , and terms linear in the small quantities : @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "this allows simplification of the relativistic breit - wigner amplitudes : @xmath104 developing eqn(2.2 ) up to first order in @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 yields the relation : @xmath108   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 the term @xmath110 which is also included in eqn(2.4 ) gives a negligible o(@xmath111 ) contribution to the neutrino oscillation formula . for muon oscillations ,",
    "however , it gives a term of o(@xmath105 ) in the interference term , as discussed below .",
    "similarly , the exact formula for the neutrino energy : @xmath112 in combination with eqn(2.4 ) gives , for the neutrino velocity : @xmath113~+~o(m_i^4,\\delta_{\\pi}^2,\\delta_i^2)\\ ] ] this formula will be used below to calculate the neutrino times - of - flight : @xmath114 .",
    "the unitary transformation specifying the mixing of the flavour and mass neutrino eigenstates is defined by a single real mixing angle @xmath115 : @xmath116 and the mass eigenstates @xmath117 respect the orthonormality conditions : @xmath118    the parts of the amplitudes requiring the most careful discussion are the invariant space - time propagators @xmath89 , as it is mainly their treatment that leads to the different result for the neutrino oscillation phase found in the present paper , as compared to those having previously appeared in the literature . in the limit of large time - like separations",

    "the integral over the physical pion mass is readily performed by replacing the breit - wigner function by a gaussian as in eqn(2.22 ) .",

    "the exponential damping factor in the interference term in eqn(2.26 ) is derived using the relations : @xmath163 and @xmath164 to obtain @xmath165 the damping factor arises because the difference in the times - of - flight of the two neutrino paths is limited by the pion lifetime .",
    "it will be seen below , however , that for distances @xmath2 of practical interest for the observation of neutrino oscillations , the damping effect is tiny .",
    "the part of the oscillation phase in eqn(2.25 ) originating from the neutrino propagators ( the term associated with the ` 1 ' within the large curved brackets ) differs by a factor two from the corresponding expression in the standard formula .",

    "this has three effects : an uncertainy in the value of @xmath57 , a doppler shift of the neutrino energy and a time dilatation correction correction factor of @xmath173 in the equation ( 2.16 ) for the pion phase increment . assuming that the target is at room temperature ( t= @xmath174 k ) , the mean kinetic energy of @xmath175 correponds to a mean pion momentum of @xmath176 mev and a mean velocity of @xmath177 km / sec .",
    "the pion will move , in one mean lifetime ( @xmath178 sec ) , a distance of 146@xmath179 .",

    "the distributions of @xmath96 and @xmath97 are determined by breit - wigner amplitudes , that are the fourier transforms of the corresponding exponential decay laws , in terms of the decay widths @xmath91 and @xmath93 respectively . in accordance with eqn(1.2 ) , only the breit - wigner amplitudes corresponding to the physical muon masses are ( coherently ) integrated over at the amplitude level . the integral over @xmath96 ( a property of the initial state ) is performed ( incoherently ) at the level of the transition probability . because of the long lifetimes of the @xmath48 and @xmath50 , the corresponding momentum wave packets are very narrow , so that all corrections resulting from integration over the resulting momentum spectra are found to give vanishingly small corrections .       indeed ,",
    "as is evident from the discussion of eqn(5.10 ) above , the width of the momentum wave packet is much smaller than the difference in the momenta of the eigenstates expected for experimentally interesting values of the neutrino mass difference ( say , @xmath373 ) .",
    "however , contrary to the prediction of eqn(5.10 ) , this does not at all prevent the observation of neutrino oscillations .",
    "this is because the oscillations result from interference between amplitudes corresponding to different propagation times , not momenta , of the neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "table 1 shows contributions to the fractional smearing of the neutrino momentum from different sources :    * neutrino mass difference @xmath373 ( eqn(2.4 ) ) * coherent effect due to the physical muon mass ( @xmath374 in eqn(2.4 ) ) * incoherent effect due to the physical pion mass ( @xmath375 in eqn(2.4 ) ) * incoherent doppler effect assuming @xmath376    the pion mass effect is of the same order of magnitude as the neutrino mass shift .",
    "the muon mass effect is two orders of magnitude smaller , while the doppler effect at room temperature gives a shift eleven orders of magnitude larger than a ( 1ev)@xmath195 neutrino mass difference squared .",
    "according to the usual interpretation of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , the neutrinos from pion decay , which , as has been shown above , correspond to very narrow momentum wave packets , would be expected to have a very large spatial uncertainty . indeed , interpreting the width of the coherent momentum wave packet generated by the spread in @xmath377 according to the the momentum - space uncertainty relation @xmath378 gives @xmath379 km .",
    "does this accurately represent the knowledge of the position of a decay neutrino obtainable in the experiment shown in fig.1 ? without any experimental difficulty , the decay time of the pion can be measured with a precision of @xmath380sec , by detecting the decay muon .",
    "thus , at any later time the distance of the neutrino from the decay point is known with a precision of @xmath381 cm .",
    "this is a factor 4@xmath382 more precise than the ` uncertainty ' given by the heisenberg relation .",
    "it is clear that the experimental knowledge obtainable on the position of the neutrino is essentially classical , in agreement with the theoretical description in terms of classical particle trajectories in space - time . in this case",
    "the momentum - position uncertainty relation evidently does not reflect the possible experimental knowledge of the position and momentum of the neutrino .",
    "this is because it does not take into account the prior knowledge that the mass of the neutrino is much less than that of the pion or muon , so that its velocity is , with negligible uncertainty , c. in spite of this , a heisenberg uncertainty relation is indeed respected in the pion decay process .",
    "the breit - wigner amplitude that determines the coherent spread of neutrino momentum is just the fourier transform of the exponential decay law of the muon .",
    "the width parameter of the breit - wigner amplitude and the muon mean lifetime do indeed respect the _ energy - time _",
    "uncertainty relation @xmath383 .",
    "it is then clear , from this careful analysis of neutrino oscillations following pion decay at rest , that , in contradiction to what has been almost universally assumed until now , _",
    "the neutrinos are not described by a coherent spatial wave packet_. there is a coherent momentum wave packet , but it is only a kinematical consequence of a breit wigner amplitude . if for mathematical convenience",
    ", the momentum wave packet is represented by a gaussian , a conjugate ( and spurious ) gaussian spatial wave packet will be generated by fourier transformation .",
    "indeed , in the majority of wave packet treatments that have appeared in the literature , gaussian momentum and spatial wave packets related by a fourier transform with widths satisfying the ` uncertainty relation ' @xmath384 have been used .",
    "the above discussion shows that such a treatment does not correspond to the actual knowledge of the space - time events that constitute realistic neutrino oscillation experiments .    the limitation on the detection distance @xmath2 , for observation of neutrino oscillations , given by the damping factor @xmath385 of eqn(2.30 ) is easily understood in terms of the classical particle trajectories shown in fig.1 . for a given velocity difference , the time difference @xmath386 becomes very large when both neutrinos , in the alternative classical histories , are required to arrive simultaneously at a far distant detector . because of the finite pion lifetime , however , the amplitude for pion decay at time @xmath77 is smaller than that at @xmath76 by the factor @xmath387 $ ] . integrating over all decay times results in the exponential damping factor @xmath385 of eqn(2.30 ) .",
    "it is clear that , contrary to the damping factor @xmath344 of eqn(5.11 ) , the physical origin of the @xmath2 dependent damping factor is quite unrelated to ` wavepacket overlap ' .    for a given value of @xmath386 the coherent neutrino momentum spread originating in the breit wigner amplitude for @xmath377",
    "produces a corresponding velocity smearing that reduces the number of possible classical trajectories arriving at the detection event .",
    "this effect is taken into account in the integral shown in eqn(2.23 ) .",
    "the effect is shown , in section 2 above , to be much smaller than the ( already tiny ) pion lifetime damping described above , and it is neglected in eqn(2.26 ) .    finally , as descibed after eqn(2.25 ) , the ( incoherent ) integration over the breit wigner function containing @xmath96 gives an additional damping correction to the interference term that is also very tiny compared to that due to the pion lifetime .",
    "as promised above , a final remark is now made on the physical interpretation of the damping factors ( 5.10 ) and ( 5.11 ) that have often been derived and discussed in the literature .",
    "although as pointed out above , and to be further discussed below , the derivation of these factors is incorrect , as it results from coherent integration over different spatial positions of the neutrino source , similar factors do appear when performing the integrations over the ( unobserved ) neutrino momentum distributions .",
    "@xmath344 is replaced by @xmath385 and @xmath350 by the factor resulting from the coherent integration over the physical muon mass @xmath377 .",
    "the reason for the huge suppression factor predicted by eqn(5.10 ) , and the tiny one found in the path amplitude calculation , is that , in deriving ( 5.10 ) and ( 5.11 ) , it is assumed that the neutrino eigenstates are both produced and detected at equal times .",
    "this will only be possible if both the hypothetical ` wave packet overlap ' is appreciable ( eqn(5.11 ) ) and also the momentum smearing is sufficiently large that the time - of - flight differences due to the different neutrino masses are washed out ( eqn(5.10 ) . in the path amplitude calculation interference and hence oscillations are made possible by different _ decay times _ of the source pion , and the damping factors analagous to @xmath344 and @xmath350 turn out to give vanishingly small corrections to the oscillation term .",
    "it may be remarked that the physical interpretation of ` neutrino oscillations ' provided by the path amplitude description is different from the conventional one in terms of ` flavour eigenstates ' . in the latter the amplitudes of different flavours in the neutrino",
    "are supposed to vary harmonically as a function of time . in the amplitudes for the different physical processes in the path amplitude treatment",
    "there is , instead , no variation of lepton flavour in the propagating neutrinos .",
    "if the mass eigenstates are represented as superpositions of flavour eigenstates using the inverses of eqns(2.8 ) and ( 2.9 ) , there is evidently no temporal variation of the lepton flavour composition . only in the detection process itself",
    "are the flavour eigenstates projected out , and the interference effect occurs that is described as ` neutrino oscillations ' . in the case of the observation of the recoil muons",
    "no such projection takes place , but exactly similar interference effects are predicted to occur . as previously emphasised  @xcite , the ` flavour",
    "oscillations ' of neutrinos , neutral kaons and b - mesons are just special examples of the universal phenomenon of quantum mechanical superposition that is the basis of eqn(1.2 ) .      by far the most widespread difference from the path amplitude treatment of the present paper is the non - respect of the basic quantum mechanical formula , ( 1.2 ) , by the introduction of wave packets to describe ` source ' and/or ` detector ' particles[7,8,10,11,30 - 46 ] . since in any practical neutrino oscillation experiment a single initial or final quantum state , as specified by eqn(1.2 ) , is not defined , but rather sets of initial and final states @xmath388 and @xmath389 determined by experimental conditions , eqn(1.2 ) may be generalised to : @xmath390 to be contrasted with the formula used in the references cited above : @xmath391 here , @xmath392 and @xmath393 are ` source ' and ` detector ' wave packets respectively . in eqn(5.17 )",
    "the initial states @xmath394 and final states @xmath395 of eqn(5.16 ) , that correspond to different spatial positions , and also , possibly , different kinematic properties , of the source particle or detection event , are convoluted with spatial and/or temporal ` wave packets ' , that , as discussed above , are devoid of physical significance .",
    "use of eqn(5.17 ) leads to the absurd prediction ( see , for example , eqn(5.15 ) above ) that _ different _ initial or final state particles interfere with each other . a possible reason for the widespread use of eqn(5.17 ) instead of ( 5.16 )",
    "may be understood following a remark of the author of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning a ` paradox ' of the complete quantum field theory calculation that takes into account , by a single invariant amplitude , production , propagation and detection of the neutrinos .",
    "it was noticed that , if the amplitude for the complete chain of processes is considered to correspond to one big feynman diagram , then integration over the space - time coordinates of the initial and final states will reduce the exponential factors , containing the essential information on the interference phase , to energy - momentum conserving delta functions , and so no oscillations will be possible .",
    "a related remark was made by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite who stated that , as they were assuming exact energy - momentum conservation , the integration over the space - time coordinates could be omitted .",
    "they still , however , ( quite inconsistently , in view of the previous remark ) retained the exponential factors containing the interference phase information .",
    "these considerations indicate a general confusion between momentum space feynman diagram calculations , where it is indeed legitimate to integrate , at the amplitude level , over the unobserved space - time positions of the initial and final state particles , and the case of neutrino oscillations , where the amplitude must be defined in configuration space . in the latter case ,",
    "it is the unobserved momenta of the propagating particles that should be integrated over , as is done in eqns(2.1 ) and ( 2.35 ) above , and not the space - time positions of the ` source ' or ` detector ' particles , as in eqn(5.17 ) .",
    "it is clear that exact energy - momentum conservation plays a crucial role in the path amplitude calculation .",
    "this is valid only in a fully covariant theory .",
    "still , several authors , in spite of the ultra - relativistic nature of neutrinos , used a non - relativistic theory to describe the production , propagation and detection of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , in such ` old fashioned perturbation theory '  @xcite energy is not conserved at the level of propagators and so no precise analysis of the kinematics and the space - time configurations of the production and detection events , essential in the covariant path amplitude analysis , is possible .",
    "even when , in some cases , the complete production , propagation and detection process of the neutrinos were described[35 - 37,39,40 ] , equal neutrino energies [ 37,39,40 ] , equal neutrino momenta [ 36 ] or either  @xcite were assumed , in contradiction with energy - momentum conservation and a consistent space - time description of the production and detection events .",
    "as follows directly from eqn(5.3 ) ( or the similar formula , for the neutrino momentum , obtained by assuming equal neutrino energies ) , in all the above cited references , the standard formula ( 1.1 ) for the oscillation phase was obtained .",
    "an interesting discussion of the interplay between different kinematical assumptions ( not respecting energy - momentum conservation ) and the space - time description of the production and detection events was provided in ref .",
    "this treatment was based on the lorentz - invariant propagator phase of eqn(2.12 ) . by assuming either equal momentum or equal energy for the propagating neutrinos , but allowing _ different times of propagation _ for the two mass eigenstates , values of @xmath396 agreeing with eqns(2.15 ) and ( 2.25 ) above",
    "were found , _",
    "i.e. _ differing by a factor two from the standard formula .",
    "alteratively , assuming equal velocities , ( and hence equal propagation times ) the standard result ( 1.1 ) was obtained . in this latter case , however , the masses , momenta and energies of the neutrinos must be related , up to corrections of o(@xmath105 ) , according to : @xmath397 since the ratio of the neutrino masses may take , in general , any value , so must then the ratio of their momenta . for the case of neutrino production from pion decay at rest with @xmath398",
    "the relation ( 5.18 ) is clearly incompatible with eqn(2.4 ) which gives : @xmath399 on the other hand , eqn(5.19 ) is clearly compatible ( up to corrections of o(@xmath160 ) ) with the ` equal momentum ' hypothesis .",

    "pion and muon lifetime effects were mentioned in ref .",

    "the authors of the latter paper attempted to draw conclusions on the possibility , or otherwise , of particle oscillations by using ` plane waves ' , _ i.e. _ energy - momentum eigenfunctions .",
    "as is well known , such wavefunctions are not square integrable , and so can yield no spatial information . the probability to find a particle described by such a wave function in any finite spatial volume is zero .",

    "observation of neutrino oscillations following pion decay , using a covariant formalism ( schwinger s parametric integral representation of the space - time propagator ) was considered in ref .",
    "exact energy - momentum conservation was imposed , but integration over the pion spatial position at amplitude level , as in eqn(5.17 ) , was done and no account was taken of the contribution of the pion space - time propagator to the oscillation phase . as the different eigenstates were assumed to be be produced or detected at identical space - time points equal propagation velocities were implicitly assumed , so that just as in refs@xcite , where the same assumption was made , the standard neutrino oscillation phase was obtained . in the conclusion of this paper the almost classical nature of the space - time trajectories followed by the neutrinos was stressed , although this was not taken to its logical conclusion in the previous discussion , _",
    "e.g. _ the kinematical inconsistency of the equal velocity hypothesis that requires the evidently impossible condition ( 5.18 ) to be satisfied .    in a recent paper  @xcite , the standard neutrino oscillation formula with oscillation phase given by eqn(1.1 )",
    "was compared with a neutrino decoherence model . in order to take into account incertainties in the position of the source and the neutrino energy , an average was made over the quantity @xmath403 , assuming that it is distributed according to a gaussian with mean value @xmath404 and width @xmath405 .",
    "the average was performed in an incoherent manner .",

    "the use of the invariant path amplitude formalism has previously been recommended  @xcite for experiments involving correlated pairs of neutral kaons . here , just a few remarks will be made on the main differences to be expected from the case of neutrino or muon oscillations .",
    "a more detailed treatment will be presented elsewhere@xcite .    in the case of neutrino and muon oscillations ,",
    "the interference effect is possible as the different neutrino eigenstates can be produced at different times .",
    "this is because the decay lifetimes of all interesting sources ( pions , muons , @xmath0-decaying nuclei ) are much longer than the time difference beween the paths corresponding to the interfering amplitudes . to see",
    "if a similar situation holds in the case of @xmath406 oscillations , three specific examples will be considered with widely differing momenta of the neutral kaons :      these correspond to neutral kaon momenta of 108 mev , 750 mev and 5 gev respectively . in each case",

    "these effects are readily calculated using the gaussian approximation ( 2.22 ) of the present paper .",
    "the main contribution to the velocity smearing is due to the variation of the physical mass of the @xmath412 rather than those of the @xmath413 or @xmath427 .    for the @xmath428 oscillation case , analagous to ( i ) above",

    "it is interesting to mention two types of atomic physics experiments where interference effects similar to the conjectured ( and perhaps observed  @xcite ) neutrino oscillations have aleady been clearly seen .",
    "the first is quantum beat spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "this type of experiment , which has previously been discussed in connection with neutrino oscillations  @xcite , corresponds closely to the gedanken experiment used by heisenberg  @xcite to exemplify the the fundamental law of quantum mechanics eqn(1.2 ) .",
    "the atoms of an atomic beam are excited by passage through a thin foil or a laser beam .",
    "the quantum phase of an atom with excitation energy @xmath254 evolves with time according to : @xmath436 ( see the discussion after eqn(3.3 ) above ) .",
    "if decay photons from two nearby states with excitation energies @xmath437 and @xmath438 are detected after a time interval @xmath130 ( for example by placing a photon detector beside the beam at a variable distance @xmath439 from the excitation foil ) a cosine interference term with phase : @xmath440 where @xmath441 is the average velocity of the atoms in the beam , is observed  @xcite .",
    "an atom in the beam , before excitation , corresponds to the neutrino source pion .",
    "the excitation process corresponds to the decay of the pion .",
    "the propagation of the two different excited states , _ alternative _ histories of the initial atom , correspond to the _ alternative _ propagation of the two neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "finally the dexcitation of the atoms and the detection of a _ single _ photon corresponds to the neutrino detection process .",
    "the particular importance of this experiment for the path amplitude calculations presented in the present paper , is that it demonstrates , experimentally , the important contribution to the interference phase of the space - time propagators of excited atoms , in direct analogy to the similar contributions of unstable pions , muons and nuclei discussed above .    an even closer analogy to neutrino osillations following pion decay is provided by the recently observed process of photodetachement of an electron by laser excitation : the ` photodetachment microscope '  @xcite .",
    "a laser photon ejects the electron from , for example , an @xmath442 ion in a beam .",
    "the photodetached electron is emitted in an s - wave ( isotropically ) and with a fixed initial energy .",
    "it then moves in a constant , vertical , electric field that is perpendicular to the direction of the ion beam and almost parallel to the laser beam .",
    "an upward moving electron that is decelerated by the field eventually undergoes ` reflection ' before being accelerated towards a planar position - sensitive electron detector situated below the beam and perpendicular to the electric field direction ( see fig.1 of ref .",

    "an interference pattern is generated by the phase difference between the amplitudes corresponding to the two allowed trajectories .",
    "the phase difference , derived by performing the feynman path integral of the classical action along the classical trajectories  @xcite , gives a very good description of the observed interference pattern .",
    "the extremely close analogy between this experiment and the neutrino oscillation experiments described in sections 2 and 3 above is evident .",
    "notice that the neutrinos , like the electrons in the photodetachement experiment , must be emitted at different times , in the alternative paths , for interference to be possible .",
