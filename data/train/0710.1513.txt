    "whatever the type of waves involved , knowing the green s function of an heterogeneous medium is the key to many essential applications like imaging , communication or detection . in the last twenty years or so , mesoscopic physics has intensely studied wave phenomena in strongly disordered media : weak and strong localization , radiative transfer and diffusion approximation etc . @xcite .",
    "but the _ exact _ green s function of a complex medium is not easily tractable , and usually theoreticians study ensemble - averaged quantities like statistical correlations of intensities or wave fields .",
    "moreover , from an experimental point of view , it is not always possible to measure the green s functions of a complex medium because it requires controllable arrays of sources and receivers that do not perturb the medium . in the context of laboratory ultrasound , this is ( nearly ) routine ; but in other fields of wave physics like seismology , distant sources are not controllable . in that respect ,",
    "a good deal of publications followed recent works by weaver .",

    "some theoretical works are based on the ergodic approximation where time and ensemble average coincide .",
    "this approach is very useful for estimating the role of scattering in the correlation asymmetry @xcite .",
    "when several sources are available , another possibility is to average correlations over sources without moving the receivers .",
    "this was done in underwater acoustics @xcite .",
    "et al _  @xcite showed the possibility of recovering the entire green s function of the sea waveguide ( especially the late contributions of multiples ) and proposed a model for estimating the signal - to - noise ratio of the correlations .",
    "@xcite proposed to interpret the green s function reconstruction in terms of a time - reversal analogy , and showed that all the benefits of time - reversal devices in multiple scattering media could be fruitfully applied to `` passive imaging '' from correlations @xcite .",
    "this idea is based on the mathematical principle of the representation theorem @xcite , equivalently referred to as the helmholtz - kirchhoff theorem @xcite : if a perfect series of receivers has been sensing the wave field for ages , then one can mathematically have access to the wave field anytime and anywhere in the area enclosed by the sensors .",

    "the correlation principle was successfully applied to seismic waves @xcite .",
    "the most energetic part of the green s function between two seismic stations ( rayleigh and love wave trains ) was retrieved from passive correlations of either coda waves or records of seismic noise . as we mentioned earlier , obtaining impulse responses without a controllable source",
    "is of high interest in seismology since it gives the possibility of simulating very energetic and punctual earthquakes everywhere around the earth , and do imaging without a controllable source ( `` passive imaging '' ) .",
    "results are quite encouraging although several theoretical problems remain unsolved .",
    "they concern issues very specific to the earth .",
    "in particular elastic sources ( earthquakes ) are naturally never arranged in such a way that they would perfectly surround a couple of seismic stations .",
    "in addition , for distant earthquakes , the propagation directions of incident bulk waves are mostly vertical , and in a vertically layered medium they would not couple with rayleigh waves .",
    "so , why do we observe a rayleigh wave train in the correlation of waves generated by bulk sources ?",
    "the green s function retrieval is linked to equipartition , which is due to wave scattering .",
    "so , what is the influence of scattering within the earth crust in that process ?",

    "the 2-d spatial fourier transform of the hole positions was calculated and is almost perfectly flat in the range of ultrasonic wavelengths involved in the experiment , which confirms the absence of spatial correlation between the holes .",

    "we therefore simulated an open slab in the @xmath15 and @xmath12 direction with a free surface at the top .",
    "rigorously , the earth crust is a waveguide that partially leaks energy through the moho to the underlying mantle . to perfectly match this feature",
    "we should have placed a infinite medium with a different impedance at the bottom side of the aluminum slab . yet",
    "we think that our results and conclusions do not suffer too much from this omission : the central point of our set - up is to mimic an elastic and scattering medium , infinite in the horizontal directions with a free surface on the top .",

    "we think this interpretation explains why the symmetric wavefront is much more noisy at low frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ resxcorr_f1 ] ) , where lots of cavities are encountered in the first half wavelength , than at higher frequencies where the rayleigh wavefront can propagate freely ( fig .",
    "[ assymetrybf ] ) .",
    "+ finally , we comment on the possible misidentification of the waves that are reconstructed in our experiment . indeed ,",
    "if many scatterers are present within a wavelength , the overall wave velocity may be different ( effective medium ) .",
    "in the heterogeneous plate , a reduced - speed shear wave might propagate with the same wavespeed as a rayleigh wave in the bulk aluminium plate ( i.e. without cavities ) .",
    "in our experiment , the hole interspacing is 10  mm on average , which is larger than the largest ultrasonic wavelength .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that the shear waves propagate in the aluminium plate with the same wavespeed as in the bulk .",
    "the measured wave velocity is 2.9  mm/@xmath17s at all frequencies ( from 0.8  mhz to 3.2  mhz ) and indeed corresponds to the velocity of the rayleigh wave .",
    "+     evolution of the asymmetry in the reconstructed green s function in the high frequency regime ( 1.6 - 3.2  mhz ) , for early ( a ) and late ( b ) time windows . at early times , the waves are exciting scatterers preferably on one side of the receiving array . after 45  @xmath17s , bulk waves are expected to be equipartitioned , but not rayleigh waves .",
    "mode conversion to rayleigh waves mainly occurs at one scattering cavity , leading to an anisotropic energy flux , and an asymmetric correlation.,width=325 ]",
    "in this paper were presented laboratory experiments of elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous media at ultrasonic frequencies .",
    "an aluminum slab was made quasi - infinite by the use of absorbing boundaries to mimic the earth s crust , in which scattering was obtained drilling cylindrical cavities .",
    "a relatively simple theoretical model for wave scattering properties was proposed .",
    "wave field generation and detection was achieved using contactless and quasi - punctual laser devices .",
    "the cross - correlation of diffuse fields was performed , allowing us to retrieve passively the rayleigh wave between two sensors only when scattering was present . without scatterers , and in the case of bulk wave generation and surface detection ,",
    "no rayleigh wave was reconstructed .",
    "this illustrates the role of scattering and mode conversion in the green s function passive reconstruction .",
    "+ analysis for different time - windows and frequency bands were conducted .",
    "previous works in acoustics  @xcite and seismology  @xcite observed that the rayleigh wave reconstruction was harder with increasing frequency .",
    "here we found that the rayleigh wave reconstruction was more efficient in the high frequency band .",
    "in addition we observed that even in the late coda where waves are expected to be equipartitioned , asymmetry in the correlations may remain .",
    "both observations are due to the very specific coupling between bulk and rayleigh waves , which occurs if scatterers are present in the first wavelength beneath the free surface .",
    "we emphasize that equipartition of bulk waves does not always mean equipartition of surface waves . on the one hand ,",
    "our experiments show the need of scattering to passively retrieve the impulse response between two sensors , on the other hand they show that scattering occurring between the sensors degrade the reconstructed rayleigh waves .",
    "the trade - off between the two effects should be further investigated .",
    "though our experiment was designed for seismological applications , results should be applicable to other fields of wave physics where both surface and bulk waves are present .",
    "here follows a brief calculation of the wave field scattered by a cylindrical cavity insonified by a plane compressional wave .",
    "three displacement potentials are relevant : @xmath104 is the displacement potential of the incident p wave , @xmath105 is the scattered p wave potential and @xmath106 is the scattered s wave potential . they can be expanded as :      where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are respectively the bessel and hankel functions both of first kind and of order @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the neumann factor . taking into account the null traction condition at the surface of the cylinder allows the calculation of the @xmath114 and @xmath115 coefficients .",
