    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is our close neighbor .",
    "it plays a key role in determinations of the cosmological distance scale ( e.g. , mould et al .",
    "2000 ) and is used to study the presence of dark objects in the galactic halo through microlensing ( e.g. , alcock et al .",
    "2000b ; lasserre et al .",
    "2000 ; udalski et al .",
    "it is also of fundamental importance for all studies of stellar populations and the interstellar medium ( see the book on the magellanic clouds by westerlund 1997 ) .",
    "for all these applications it is essential to have a good understanding of the overall structure of the lmc as a galaxy , which is the topic of the present series of papers .",
    "the generally accepted consensus is that the lmc is a disk galaxy with an approximately planar geometry ( the evidence for this is reviewed in section  [ ss : planar ] ) .",
    "the most basic parameters in our understanding of the lmc are therefore the angles that describe the direction from which we are viewing the lmc plane : the inclination angle @xmath13 and the position angle @xmath14 of the line of nodes ( the intersection of the galaxy plane and the sky plane ) .",
    "it is remarkable that our knowledge of these parameters is only quite rudimentary , given that the lmc is easily visible with the naked eye and is many times the size of the full moon .",
    "the previous work on the lmc viewing geometry is summarized in table  3.5 of westerlund ( 1997 ) . the quoted results for @xmath13 and @xmath14 easily span a range of @xmath15 each , even if one restricts the discussion to the most reliable studies .",
    "the large majority of all previous studies of the lmc viewing geometry have estimated the viewing angles under the assumption that the lmc disk is circular , using either the spatial distribution of tracers on the sky ( as reviewed in section  [ ss : circphot ] ) or their kinematics ( as reviewed in section  [ ss : circkin ] ) .",
    "the obvious disadvantage of this approach is that there is no evidence that the lmc is indeed circular . to the contrary",
    ", all available evidence seems to indicate that the lmc is a highly complicated system with none of the characteristic symmetries that are often seen in spiral galaxies .",
    "its interaction with the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and the galactic tidal field ( e.g. , putman et al .",
    "1998 ) may be partly responsible for this .",
    "the lmc hosts a central bar that is offset from the center of the outer isophotes ; the hi rotation center coincides with neither ( westerlund 1997 ) .",
    "the principal axes of the hi velocity field are not perpendicular , and the zero - velocity curve twists by @xmath16 from small to large radii ( kim et al .",
    "so it seems reasonable to worry about the accuracy of viewing angles inferred under the assumption of circular symmetry .",
    "a more robust way to determine the lmc viewing angles is to use geometrical considerations without making assumptions about the distribution or kinematics of tracers in the lmc plane .",
    "this is possible , because the inclination of the lmc causes one side of it to be closer to us than the other .",
    "as a result , tracers on one side of the lmc should appear brighter than those on the other side .",
    "this is not a subtle effect , but should amount to @xmath17@xmath18 mag for the viewing angles that are commonly quoted in the literature ( as discussed in section  [ s : theory ] ) .",
    "this method does not rely on absolute distances or magnitudes , which are notoriously difficult to estimate , but only on relative distances or magnitudes .",
    "what has been lacking most is a large enough sample of stars to apply the method to .",
    "cepheids have yielded results , but so far only with large error bars ( as reviewed in section  [ ss : cepheids ] ) .",
    "large - area digital surveys such as the magellanic cloud photometric survey ( zaritsky , harris & thompson 1997 ) , denis ( epchtein et al .",
    "1997 ) and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; e.g. , skrutskie 1998 ) are now providing important new tools to analyze the lmc structure . in particular , the lmc viewing geometry can be constrained by studying how the apparent magnitude of well - defined features in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) varies as a function of position in the lmc .",
    "a similar technique has been used to study the inclination of the bar in the milky way ( e.g. , stanek et al .",
    "weinberg & nikolaev ( 2000 ) applied this technique to the lmc , using asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars selected from the 2mass survey , but they did not pursue this issue in as much detail as we do here ( as discussed in section  [ ss : agb2mass ] ) .    in this first paper of a series on lmc structure",

    "this yields the following transformations : @xmath43 if necessary , these equations can be expressed in terms of @xmath25 using equations  ( [ rhodef])([phidef2 ] ) ( see also appendix a of weinberg & nikolaev 2000 ) .",

    "one can expand equation  ( [ dsimpler ] ) using a taylor expansion to obtain that @xmath62    in practice one does not directly have access to distances , but one does have access to stellar magnitudes .",

    "for small angular distances @xmath30 , one can use equation  ( [ dtaylor ] ) and make a further taylor expansion of the logarithm to obtain @xmath66 where the angular distance @xmath30 is now expressed in degrees , to make it easier to assess the size of the magnitude difference for realistic situations .",
    "the constant in the equation is @xmath67 magnitudes .",
    "hence , the magnitude at fixed @xmath30 has an approximately sinusoidal variation with position angle @xmath32 , with amplitude @xmath68 .",
    "stars in the lmc can be traced to radii @xmath30 of 510 degrees from the center , and previous analyses have suggested that @xmath69 ( so that @xmath70 ; e.g. , westerlund 1997 ) .",
    "hence , in the lmc one expects distance - related magnitude variations up to several tenths of a magnitude ( much larger than typical observational errors ) . at fixed @xmath30 , the magnitude variation @xmath64 always reaches its extrema at angles perpendicular to the line of nodes , @xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ f : maxminvar ] shows @xmath64 as function of @xmath30 along this line , for different values of the inclination @xmath13 , as calculated from equations  ( [ dmaxandmin ] ) and  ( [ magdif ] ) . for comparison ,",

    "the usual method of measuring position angles in astronomy is to measure counterclockwise , starting from the north .",
    "by contrast , the angles @xmath32 and @xmath45 defined above are measured counterclockwise starting from the west .",
    "it is therefore useful to define @xmath73 which are the position angle of a point in the lmc and the position angle of the line - of - nodes , respectively , now measured with the usual astronomical convention .    the description of the lmc viewing geometry using the angle @xmath14 can lead to some confusion , since the angle @xmath14 is defined modulo @xmath74 , whereas the line - of - nodes is a line , and can therefore be described by two different position angles that differ by @xmath75 .",
    "the definition used here corresponds to the usual convention ( e.g. , westerlund 1997 ) , by which the quantity referred to as the ` position angle of the line - of - nodes ' ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) is defined such that points in the direction of position angle @xmath76 are closer to the observer than those in the direction of position angle @xmath77 .",

    "1997 ) and 2mass ( e.g. , skrutskie 1998 ) are now yielding catalogs with up to millions of stars , which are ideally suited for a study of this nature .    in the present paper",
    "the discussion is restricted mostly to the near - ir data from the denis survey , and in particular to the data collected in the denis catalog towards the magellanic clouds ( dcmc ; cioni et al .",
    "we used the latest version , which includes the data for the few scan strips missing from the first release .",
    "the resulting catalog has complete coverage over the lmc area with @xmath78 ra @xmath79 and @xmath80 dec @xmath81 ( see figure  [ f : imagegrid ] below ) .",
    "it contains stellar magnitudes of sources detected in at least two of the three denis bands ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath82 ) . for the present analysis",
    "all sources in the catalog were used .",
    "sources with non - optimal values of any of the dcmc data - quality flags were not excluded to optimize the statistics of the sample ( several tests were performed to verify that this does not degrade the accuracy of the final results ) .",
    "an improved calibration of the photometric zeropoints for the individual denis scan strips was performed .",
    "this significantly increased the accuracy of the dcmc , as discussed in appendix  [ s : appa ] .",
    "systematic errors in the resulting stellar magnitudes are believed to be no larger than @xmath83 mag , i.e. , much smaller than the expected distance - induced magnitude variations ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : maxminvar ] ) .",
    "the issue of possible systematic errors is further addressed in section  [ ss : caterrors ] , among other things by comparison to 2mass data .",
    "figure  [ f : cmds ] shows the nine cmds that can be generated from the @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath82 data in the dcmc .",
    "the general features of these near - ir cmds of the lmc have been previously discussed by cioni et al .",
    "( 2000a , b , c ) .",
    "detailed discussions of the near - ir @xmath84 and optical @xmath85 cmds of the lmc have been presented by nikolaev & weinberg ( 2000 ) and alcock et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , respectively .",
    "we therefore summarize here only the main features of the cmds in figure  [ f : cmds ] , as relevant in the present context .",
    "lmc stars in the rgb evolutionary phase are responsible for the pronounced feature that extends downward , slanted somewhat to the left , from the center of each cmd panel in figure  [ f : cmds ] .",
    "the horizontal bar at the right axis of each panel indicates the magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) , as determined by cioni et al .",
    "( 2000c ) .",
    "lmc stars in the agb evolutionary phase are responsible for feature(s ) at magnitudes that are brighter and redder than the trgb .",
    "there are two main types of agb stars , namely the oxygen - rich ( o - rich ) and the carbon - rich ( c - rich ) agb stars . in the cmds involving the @xmath86 color ( bottom panels in figure  [ f : cmds ] ) these families separate into easily distinguishable features .",
    "the o - rich agb stars have an approximately constant @xmath86 color , and therefore generate a feature that extends upwards almost vertically from the trgb .",
    "the c - rich agb stars generally have a redder @xmath86 color than the o - rich agb stars , and generate the feature in the @xmath86 cmds extending to the right or top - right starting from the o - rich agb feature with minimum overlap . in some of the other cmds in figure  [ f : cmds ] the two families of agb stars occupy overlapping regions of color - magnitude space , e.g. , in the @xmath87 and @xmath88 diagrams .",
    "the relatively blue stars on the left - side of each cmd that lie in vertical features extending upward to very bright magnitudes are in large majority galactic foreground stars .",
    "the goal in the present context is to construct cmds for different spatial regions in the lmc , and to compare them .",
    "if the regions are at different distances then _ all _ features in the cmd due to stars in the lmc will shift up or down in magnitude by the same amount .",
    "so the first order of business is to determine on a purely empirical basis what vertical magnitude shifts there are between the cmds at different spatial positions . in principle",
    "one could use the full two - dimensional data in each cmd to obtain these magnitude shifts , for example by cross - correlation of the cmds at different positions .",
    "this requires only that one restricts the cross - correlation to a region of the cmd that contains little if any galactic foreground contamination and that contains well - defined features due to lmc stars .",
    "nonetheless , this may not be entirely trivial to implement for a dataset of discrete points .",
    "the more straightforward approach is therefore to analyze one - dimensional luminosity functions ( lfs ) that are obtained upon projection of a cmd along its color axis . in this projection",
    "it is sometimes useful to constrain the lf to stars with a particular range of colors , to restrict the analysis to a more homogeneous set of stars ( e.g. , stars in a similar evolutionary phase ) or to remove foreground stars .",
    "near - ir luminosity functions for the lmc contain several features that can be used to determine a characteristic magnitude .",
    "of particular use are the features due to rgb and agb stars .",
    "one prominent feature is the trgb , which is a discontinuity in the lf of rgb stars .",
    "the trgb magnitude can be determined with high accuracy for the lmc as a whole , by searching for a peak in the first or the second derivative of the lf ( cioni et al .",
    "however , one does need a very large sample of stars to obtain a high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath89 ) even after differentiation of the lf .",
    "by contrast to rgb stars , agb stars do not produce a well - defined discontinuity in the lf .",
    "however , they do produce a well - defined peak ( e.g. , see figure  [ f : histograms ] , to be discussed below ) .",
    "hence , the most prominent lf feature due to agb stars is not their maximum brightness ( as for the rgb ) , but the mode of their magnitudes ( the magnitude at which the lf has its maximum ) .",
    "this agb modal magnitude can be determined much more accurately ( for a fixed area of the sky ) than the trgb magnitude , because no differentiation of the lf is required .",
    "since the aim of the present paper is to subdivide the lmc into different spatial regions ( possibly with limited numbers of stars ) , the trgb method is not the optimal choice in the present context .",
    "nonetheless , it will be used in section  [ s : trgb ] as a consistency check on the results obtained from agb stars .",
    "the accuracy with which the agb modal magnitude can be determined depends on the photometric band of the magnitudes under study , and the color - selection applied to the agb stars .",
    "the determining factors are the number of stars in the lf peak ( the more stars , the more accurate the result ) and the width of the lf peak ( the narrower the peak , the more accurate the result ) ; see section  [ ss : lfanalysis ] below for quantitative details . in the present context",
    "it was found that the best results are obtained when the analysis is based on the @xmath87 cmd . in this diagram the entire agb feature , including both o - rich and c - rich agb stars , is almost horizontal .",
    "hence , the @xmath20 magnitude lf of stars selected by @xmath23 color makes a very useful ` standard candle ' . for the primary analysis of the present paper the color selection criterion @xmath90",
    "was used ( indicated by vertical lines in the top left panel of figure  [ f : cmds ] ) .",
    "the lower - limit was chosen to avoid a significant contribution of rgb stars to the lf .",
    "the upper limit was chosen based on tests that showed that inclusion of the relatively small number of stars with @xmath91 did not lead to a noticeable improvement in the accuracy of the final results .",
    "figure  [ f : histograms ] shows the @xmath20-band lf of stars thus selected from the dcmc .",
    "the peak due to agb stars has a gaussian width of @xmath92 mag .",
    "while it was found that particularly accurate results are obtained by studying the @xmath20-band lf of stars selected by @xmath23 color , the presence of a pronounced agb peak in the lf is not uniquely obtained only with this choice .",
    "the same color selection yields a peaked lf in all three of the near - ir photometric bands , and the same is true for selection based on @xmath93 or @xmath94 color . in section  [ s : difbands ]",
    "it is shown that the main results of the analysis are independent of which approach is adopted .",
    "for the analysis of the dcmc data the sky area of the lmc was subdivided into disjunct sectors ( as described in section  [ ss : spatial ] below ) .",
    "for each sector the lf histogram of those stars in a fixed range of colors was extracted ( in analogy with figure  [ f : histograms ] ) . to quantify the magnitude of the mode of the distribution",
    "a gaussian is fit to the peak of the lf , and the mean of the best - fitting gaussian is adopted as an estimate of the mode .",
    "experiments with various algorithms show that neither the method of binning the data to obtain the lf nor the method of fitting the gaussian make any significant difference on the final results of the analysis .",
    "the results presented here were obtained by binning the stellar magnitudes in bins of @xmath95 mag .",
    "the gaussian fit was subsequently performed by minimizing a @xmath96 quantity that measures the difference between the gaussian model and the lf histogram over an interval of size 1 mag around the peak .",
    "the lfs extracted from the data are not entirely symmetric , and a gaussian fit may therefore not yield a completely unbiased estimate of the true mode . however",
    ", this should not be very important in the present context .",
    "if the shape of the lf is not strongly dependent on position in the lmc , then the bias in the estimate of the mode should be similar for different spatial positions .",
    "such a spatially constant bias will not affect the analysis , since one is only interested in the _ relative _ distances and magnitude differences for different parts of the lmc .    to estimate",
    "the formal measurement errors on the results of the gaussian fits we have performed monte - carlo simulations . in these simulations stellar magnitudes are drawn from a gaussian distribution , for a given assumed number of stars @xmath97 and dispersion @xmath98 of the gaussian magnitude distribution .",
    "these magnitudes are binned and analyzed similarly to the real data .",
    "this procedure is repeated in monte - carlo fashion , and the distribution of the inferred peak magnitudes is then studied .",
    "the dispersion of this distribution corresponds to the formal measurement error @xmath99 that one should expect for the assumed @xmath97 and @xmath98 . from simulations with different values of @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    "it was found that for the range of values relevant to the analysis ( namely @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) the formal error is well - described ( to within @xmath102% ) by the formula measurements with rms @xmath98 equals @xmath103 .",
    "note also that @xmath99 is much smaller than the adopted binsize , which therefore does not limit the accuracy of the results . ]",
    "@xmath104 to use this formula in practice one needs an estimate of the number of stars @xmath97 . for this",
    "we use the area under the best - fitting gaussian .",
    "this is better than to use the actual number of stars in the lf histogram , since some of these stars have no influence on the fitting of the lf peak . for the quantity @xmath98 in equation  ( [ formalerror ] )",
    "we use the dispersion of the best - fitting gaussian .",
    "the accuracy of the resulting formal measurement errors will be discussed in section  [ s : difbands ] .    the random ( noise )",
    "errors in the individual stellar magnitudes in the catalog are quite negligible for the relatively bright agb stars of interest here : @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( see appendix  [ s : appa ] ) .",
    "this is much smaller than the intrinsic width of the peak of the lf , and these random errors therefore do not affect the accuracy of the determination of the modal magnitude .    to get a feeling for the magnitude scales involved ,",
    "note that for the histogram in figure  [ f : histograms ] one has @xmath108",
    "( i.e. , approximately 4.5% of all the stars in the dcmc that were detected in all three of the denis bands ) .",
    "so if one divides the lmc in 10 sectors with equal numbers of stars , then the modal agb magnitude of stars selected to have @xmath90 can be determined with an error of @xmath109 mag for each sector .",
    "if one chooses a finer subdivision in 100 sectors then the error goes up to @xmath110 mag .",
    "the expected peak - to - peak distance - induced magnitude variations are @xmath102 times larger than this ( cf .  figure  [ f : maxminvar ] ) .",
    "hence , the available statistics are more than adequate for a detailed study of the lmc viewing angles .",
    "the analysis in the present paper is restricted to the outer parts of the lmc , @xmath111 .",
    "the motivation for this is that some previous work has suggested that structures in the inner parts of the lmc ( @xmath112 ) may be decoupled from the outer lmc disk .",
    "a clear hint in this direction is that the most prominent feature in the central few degrees of the lmc , the ` bar ' , is offset from the center of the outer disk by @xmath113 ( westerlund 1997 ) .",
    "it has recently been suggested that the bar may also not be in the same plane as the outer disk ( zhao & evans 2000 ) .",
    "the second most prominent feature in the central few degrees of the lmc is the 30 doradus complex .",
    "this region is a very strong source of uv radiation , yet the hi gas disk of the lmc does not show a void in this part of the sky .",
    "this indicates that the 30 doradus complex can not be in the plane of the lmc disk ( luks & rohlfs 1992 ) .",
    "the 30 doradus region is also the center of a separate velocity component seen in radio data ( the l - component ; luks & rohlfs 1992 ) for which absorption studies indicate that it is behind the lmc disk ( dickey et al .",

    "the implications of these findings are discussed below .",
    "there are significant variations in the apparent magnitude of cmd features as a function of position in the lmc .",
    "these can be interpreted as the result of variations in distance due to the inclination of the lmc plane .",
    "such models fit the observed apparent magnitude variations with a rms residual that is similar to the formal errors in the measurements ( cf",
    ".  figures  [ f : fits ] and  [ f : banddep ] ) .",
    "this by itself suggests that other effects do not contribute to the observed apparent magnitude variations at a level that exceeds the formal measurement errors .",
    "nonetheless , it is important to address in detail to what extent the analysis may be influenced by a variety of complicating factors , including : ( a ) possible errors in the assumed position of the lmc center ; ( b ) possible errors in the assumed surface number density distribution ; ( c ) possible errors in the assumption of a planar geometry ; ( d ) possible spatial variations in the dust absorption towards or in the lmc ; ( e ) possible spatial variations in the properties ( age , metallicity , @xmath199 ) of the stellar population ; and ( f ) possible systematic errors in the catalog of stellar magnitudes .",
    "each of these issues are discussed in turn .",
    "the lmc has no unique well - defined center . among other things , the center of the bar and that of the outer isophotes are offset from each other by @xmath113 ( westerlund 1997 ; paper ii ) .",
    "so the exact choice of the lmc center in the analysis is to some extent arbitrary .",
    "however , this has no influence on the validity of the modeling or the accuracy of the results .",
    "the equations of section  [ ss : reldistmag ] are equally valid for any choice of the origin @xmath27 , and it is not assumed that the surface number density @xmath135 would have to be symmetric around @xmath200 . of course , in practice it does make sense to choose @xmath27 equal to some best estimate for the position of the lmc center , as was done , if only to ensure that different azimuthal bins have roughly equal numbers of stars . however , we verified explicitly that a different choice for the grid center does not yield statistically different results for the best - fitting viewing angles @xmath132 .",
    "the analysis of the viewing angles does not rely on assumptions about the distribution of stars in the galaxy plane ( e.g. , circular symmetry ) .",
    "the surface number density distribution @xmath135 does enter into equation  ( [ areaintegral ] ) , but only to account for the relative weighting of different parts of the lmc _ within _ a sector @xmath116 .",
    "the sectors @xmath116 adopted for the quantitative analysis ( figure  [ f : imagegrid ] ) are small enough that the predicted magnitude variation @xmath131 shows only very modest variations over a sector @xmath116 .",
    "the model predictions @xmath133 are therefore quite insensitive to the particular form adopted for @xmath135 . for the results presented in the previous sections we adopted an exponential number density profile ( weinberg & nikolaev 2000 ; paper ii ) .",
    "however , extensive testing showed that even vastly different assumptions ( including the obviously incorrect assumption of a constant @xmath135 ) yield values for @xmath132 that agree with those quoted previously to within the formal errors .",
    "the models that were fit to the data assume that the stars under consideration lie in a plane .",
    "it seems reasonably well established that the outer geometry of the lmc is indeed planar , as supported by many lines of evidence .",
    "these include the following : ( a ) the small vertical scale height indicated by the small line - of - sight velocity dispersion of long period variables ( bessell , freeman & wood 1986 ) , star clusters ( freeman , illingworth & oemler 1983 ; schommer et al .",
    "1992 ) , planetary nebulae ( meatheringham et al .  1988 ) and carbon - rich agb stars ( alves & nelson 2000 ) ; ( b ) the scatter in the period - luminosity - color relationships for cepheids ( caldwell & coulson 1986 ) and miras ( feast et al .",
    "1989 ) which would be larger than observed if the lmc had a significant scale height ; ( c ) the kinematics of hi ( luks & rohlfs 1992 ; kim et al .",
    "1998 ) and other tracers ( e.g. , schommer et al .  1992 ) which are well fit by rotating disk models ; and ( d ) the fact that other magellanic irregular galaxies similar to the lmc , some of which are seen close to edge - on , are known to have small scale - heights ( de vaucouleurs & freeman 1973 ; mccall 1993 ) .",
    "the actual scale - height of the lmc is probably population dependent , but the estimates from the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of tracers in the disk indicate values @xmath201 , possibly increasing somewhat in the outer parts of the disk ( alves & nelson 2000 ) .",
    "there is no evidence for a halo component in the lmc comparable to that of our own galaxy ( freeman et al .",
    "at the distance of the lmc ( @xmath202 ) , 1 degree on the sky corresponds to @xmath203 .",
    "the lmc extends many degrees on the sky , and it is thus reasonable to consider the lmc geometry planar .",
    "it has been a topic of debate whether the lmc contains secondary populations that do not reside in the main disk plane ( e.g. , luks & rohlfs 1992 ; zaritsky & lin 1997 ; zaritsky et al .",
    "1999 ; weinberg & nikolaev 2000 ; zhao & evans 2000 ) , but the planar geometry of the primary lmc population is not generally called into question .",
    "the measurements of the apparent magnitude variations along rings are fit by planar models with an rms residual of @xmath1 mag , which is of the same order of magnitude as the formal errors in the measurements ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : results ] ) .",
    "this is an important result , given that the amplitude of the apparent magnitude variations are nearly 10 times larger . while this does not necessarily indicate that the lmc geometry _ must _ be planar , the data presented here are certainly not in contradiction with this hypothesis .",
    "having said this , there is no question that the models employed here are in fact oversimplified because they assume that the stars under consideration lie in an _ infinitesimally thin _ plane .",
    "in reality , the stellar distribution must extend vertically .",
    "so the assumption is made implicitly that the mean distance to stars along any line of sight can be approximated as the distance to the equatorial plane .",
    "this is adequate if the vertical extent of the stellar distribution is small compared to its radial extent , which is supported by the evidence cited above . for completeness ,",
    "let us point out that in models with a considerable thickness one expects smaller magnitude variations along a ring than in infinitesimally thin models ( for a spherical model one does not expect any magnitude variations ) .",
    "so the inclination values obtained in this paper would be underestimates if the lmc disk does have a considerable thickness .",
    "in section  [ s : varm ] it was demonstrated that there is a small decrease with radius of the ( distance - corrected ) agb modal magnitude @xmath140 .",
    "the decrease is only @xmath204 mag over the range of @xmath205 degrees under study , but does appear significant .",
    "one possible explanation for this would be to assume that the lmc is not flat , but curved towards us like a soup plate .",
    "this would cause the stars in the outermost ring to appear brighter than those closer in .",
    "this explanation does not seem very plausible though , given that such planar deformations are not generally observed in other disk galaxies ( and also are probably not dynamically stable ) .",
    "alternatively , one could get a similar effect if the lmc were not curved , but had both an increasing scale height with radius and dust in its equatorial plane .",
    "observations could then possibly be biased towards stars on the near side of the equatorial plane , and for these stars the average distance to the observer would decrease as one moves outwards .",
    "we have not constructed detailed models of this type , but maybe such models could explain the observation that @xmath140 decreases slightly with radius .      there is a large amount of dust absorption towards the lmc and intrinsic to it .",
    "the amount of absorption @xmath206 can be @xmath207 mag or more , although @xmath18 mag may be a more typical value for the cool stars that are of relevance to the present study ( e.g. , zaritsky 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , the dust absorption is strongly spatially variable ( e.g. , schwering 1989 ) .",
    "so at first glance one might have thought that any study of the variation in apparent magnitude of cmd features might have provided more information about dust absorption than about distance and inclination effects .",
    "however , two effects ameliorate the influence of dust absorption on the analysis .",
    "first , each sector in the analysis is quite large , @xmath208 square degrees .",
    "so small scale variations in dust absorption average out , and the remaining variations are more modest than the variations that are sometimes seen at small scales ( e.g. , inside vs.  outside of ` dark clouds ' ; hodge 1972 ) .",
    "second , the denis survey was performed using near - ir bands , where the effects of dust absorption are less pronounced than in the optical . the extinction law given by glass ( 1999 ) with @xmath209 yields for the denis passbands that @xmath210 .",
    "so even if the average @xmath206 varied by as much as @xmath18 mag between sectors , then variations in @xmath211 would only be @xmath204 mag .",
    "this is of the same order as the formal errors in the measurements , and more than 5 times less than the variations expected due to distance effects .",
    "comparison of the results of the analysis in the different near - ir photometric bands yields a direct quantitative assessment of the effects of dust absorption . from figure",
    "[ f : banddep ] and the discussion in section  [ s : difbands ] it follows that the azimuthal variations in the agb modal magnitude are identical in the @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands , to within the formal errors .",
    "this would not have been the case if the observed variations had been due to spatial variations in dust absorption ( in which case the variations would have been larger in the @xmath20 band than in the @xmath22 band ) .",
    "any influence of azimuthal variations in dust absorption on the observed variations @xmath64 must therefore be smaller than the formal errorbars @xmath212 ( i.e. , @xmath213 mag ) . this is nearly 10 times smaller than the peak - to - peak amplitude of the observed azimuthal variations .",
    "hence , possible azimuthal variations in dust absorption do not affect the analysis at a significant level .",
    "the analysis in section  [ s : varm ] provides a constraint on the size of _ radial _ variations in the average dust absorption .",
    "the distance - corrected agb modal magnitude @xmath140 decreases by @xmath204 from the innermost to the outermost ring in the analysis .",
    "this could in principle be due to dust ; figure  [ f : mzero ] provides a hint that the variation is smaller in the @xmath22 band than in the @xmath20 and @xmath21-bands , as expect for dust , but the error bars of the @xmath140 measurements are not small enough to test this in detail .",
    "more important in the present context is that the radial variations in @xmath140 are so small .",
    "this indicates that any radial variations in the azimuthally averaged dust absorption must be quite small as well , @xmath214 mag over a radial range of 4 degrees .",
    "so large - scale variations in dust absorption should have a negligible influence on the analysis .",
    "stellar magnitudes generally depend on metallicity and age",
    ". therefore , some of the observed variations in the apparent magnitude of cmd features could be due to spatial variations in age or metallicity within the lmc .",
    "spatial variations in age definitely exist , given that the morphology of the lmc is markedly different for stars in different age groups ( e.g. , cioni et al .",
    "however , the effect of age variations on the analysis is ameliorated by the fact that only stars of a particular type are included in the analysis , either agb or rgb stars , and this tends to restrict the analysis to stars of similar mean age .",
    "the existence of a metallicity gradient in the lmc remains a topic of debate ( e.g. , harris 1983 ; olszewski et al .",
    "1991 ; kontizas , kontizas & michalitsianos 1993 ) .",
    "an important constraint on the influence of age and metallicity effects on the analysis is provided by the fact that measurements of the quantity @xmath64 are available for stars of different types ( agb and rgb ) and in different photometric bands .",
    "the magnitude variations are found to be independent of both the stellar type and the photometric band , to within the formal errors ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : difbands ] ) .",
    "this would not generally be expected if the observed magnitude variations were due entirely to spatial variations in the age or metallicity of the population .",
    "such variations often influence stellar magnitudes differently depending on stellar type and photometric band .",
    "so while this does not prove that stellar population effects are playing no role at all , there is certainly no indication from the observed azimuthal variations in @xmath64 that they would .",
    "if at all present , spatial stellar population variations are most likely to manifest themselves as radial gradients .",
    "galaxies often show radial color or line - strength gradients which indicate radial changes in age , metallicity , or both ( e.g. , binney & merrifield 1998 ) .",
    "however , the distance - corrected agb modal magnitude @xmath140 decreases by only @xmath204 from the innermost to the outermost ring in the analysis ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : varm ] ) .",
    "while this variation could quite possible be due to radial variations in age or metallicity , its size is hardly more than the formal errors @xmath212 in the measurements .",
    "so even if similar stellar - population induced variations in @xmath64 were to be present in the azimuthal direction , they would have little influence on the present analysis .",
    "the denis survey strategy uses strips at constant declination , each 12 arcmin wide in ra .",
    "the lmc data in the dcmc are made up of 119 different strips that were observed over a period of several years .",
    "the main source of systematic error in the catalog is believed to be random errors in the zeropoints for the individual strips . for the data originally discussed by cioni et al .",
    "( 2000a ) the typical 1-@xmath98 zeropoint error per strip is in the range @xmath215@xmath216 mag , depending somewhat on the photometric band and on how the error is estimated . for the analysis in the present paper",
    "an improved calibration of the zeropoints was made , described in appendix  [ s : appa ] , using the data in the overlap region between strips .",
    "after this new calibration the 1-@xmath98 zeropoint errors per strip are only of the order @xmath217@xmath218 mag .    the spatial sectors in the analysis ( see figure  [ f : imagegrid ] ) are generally @xmath219 degree wide in ra , so the data in each sector are made up of data from @xmath220 different scan strips .",
    "the zeropoint errors between adjacent strips are uncorrelated , since adjacent strips were usually observed months or years apart .",
    "hence , the average zeropoint error per sector is expected to be @xmath221 .",
    "the systematic zeropoint errors per sector are therefore expected to be well below the formal errors in the measurements of the spatial magnitude variations @xmath64 , and consequently , such errors should not affect the analysis at a significant level . of course , there could always be some other mysterious systematic error in the data . however , the spatial magnitude variations @xmath64 detected in the catalog are extremely smooth and coherent over the entire area of the lmc , cf",
    ".  figure  [ f : fits ] . since different areas of the lmc",
    "were observed months or years apart , time - ordered more - or - less randomly in ra , it is hard to think of any type of error that could plausibly produce such variations .    to further test the possible influence of any possible systematic errors in the denis data , part of the analysis",
    "was repeated using the data from the 2mass survey .",
    "the 2mass survey obtained data in the @xmath21 , @xmath222 and @xmath82 bands , and is in many ways similar to the denis survey .",
    "we extracted the 2mass point source catalog data for the lmc region of the sky from the second 2mass incremental data release .",
    "the analysis was restricted to those stars detected in all three of the 2mass bands with no special error flags . as in section",
    "[ s : difbands ] , stars were selected with @xmath223 , and these were binned into @xmath122 azimuthal sectors along one single radial ring , @xmath155 .",
    "these data were analyzed similarly as the denis data , yielding the results shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ f : banddep ] .",
    "the results are overall in good agreement with those obtained with the same color selection criterion from the denis data ( second panel of figure  [ f : banddep ] ) , and indeed with all of the results obtained from the denis data .",
    "hence , any systematic errors that may be present in any of the two surveys do not have a significant impact on the main results of our study .",
    "the denis and 2mass catalogs in the direction of the lmc are of course contaminated by foreground and background sources .",
    "the main foreground contamination comes from galactic disk stars and the main background contamination comes from galaxies behind the lmc .",
    "however , these do not affect the analysis at a noticeable level .",
    "the agb star analysis is restricted to stars with red colors , which efficiently eliminates galactic disk stars ( nikolaev & weinberg 2000 ) .",
    "background galaxies tend to be fainter than the lmc agb stars ( nikolaev & weinberg 2000 ) , so while they do contribute to the faint end of lfs such as those in figure  [ f : histograms ] , they do not affect the gaussian fits to the lf peak ( described in section  [ ss : lfanalysis ] ) .",
    "foreground and background sources also should not affect the trgb analysis , given that their lf is smooth and continuous near the rgb tip .",
    "this was addressed explicitly in section  a.3.3 of cioni et al .",

    "note that our procedures for foreground and background elimination are quite different for the agb and trgb analyses .",
    "the excellent agreement between the results from these analyses ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : banddep ] ) therefore provides further evidence that foreground and background contamination do not introduce systematic errors .",
    "having established that the observed spatial variations in the apparent magnitude of cmd features can only be plausibly interpreted as the result of inclination - induced distance variations , it is now appropriate to consider the issue of possible warps and twists in the lmc plane .",
    "the spatial grid on the sky shown in figure  [ f : imagegrid ] uses four radial rings that span the range @xmath224 .",
    "figure  [ f : fits ] showed the results for these rings obtained from an analysis of the @xmath20-band lf of agb stars selected by @xmath23 color , and section  [ s : results ] discussed model fits with constant viewing angles @xmath132 .",

    "there is a trend for both @xmath13 and @xmath14 to decrease with increasing distance @xmath30 from the lmc center . as a test of the robustness of this result ,",
    "the middle panels of figure  [ f : viewang ] show the results of a similar analysis for agb stars selected from the 2mass survey with the color selection criterion @xmath196 .",
    "the viewing angles were determined by fitting simultaneously the @xmath64-values inferred from the @xmath21 , the @xmath222 and the @xmath22 band lfs of these stars .",
    "the viewing angles for the best - fit radially - constant model are @xmath225 and @xmath226 , consistent with the values quoted above for the analysis of the @xmath20-band lf of agb stars selected by @xmath23 color from the denis survey",
    ". however , the results for the radially - varying models are somewhat different for the two analyses .",
    "the results for the variation of @xmath14 with @xmath30 are consistent given the error bars , but while the top panels of figure  [ f : viewang ] suggest a decline of @xmath14 with @xmath30 , no evidence for this is seen in the middle panels .",
    "for the inclination , the results are mutually consistent only for the first two radial rings ( @xmath227 ) ; the results for the outer two rings differ by @xmath228 .    in an attempt to reduce as much as possible all sources of error ,",
    "one final overall combined fit was performed to the variations in @xmath64 inferred from separate analyses of the following data : ( a ) @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 band denis data of stars selected to have @xmath229 ; ( b ) @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 band denis data of stars selected to have @xmath196 ; and ( c ) @xmath21 , @xmath222 and @xmath22 band 2mass data of stars selected to have @xmath196 .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  [ f : viewang ] show the results .",
    "the viewing angles for the best - fit radially - constant model are @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "the errors on these numbers reflect only the propagation of random errors into the inferred viewing angles .",
    "they should therefore be interpreted with some scepticism .",
    "the differences between the results inferred from the denis and 2mass data ( top and middle panels of figure  [ f : viewang ] ) indicate that there are probably small systematic errors in the analysis as well , which may not disappear by averaging .",
    "in addition , there is some evidence for real variations in the viewing angles with @xmath30 , as further discussed below . a more conservative estimate of the errors is therefore obtained by calculating the dispersion in the individual measurements of @xmath13 and @xmath14 obtained from the different radial rings in different datasets .",
    "this yields @xmath232 and @xmath233 , respectively .",
    "so as the final results of this paper we adopt @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "the results of the best - fit radially - varying model ( bottom panels of figure  [ f : viewang ] ) suggest that there is an abrupt decrease in inclination from @xmath236 for @xmath237 to @xmath238 for @xmath239 , as well as a gradual decrease in the position angle of the line of nodes from @xmath240 for @xmath241 to @xmath242 for @xmath243 .",
    "while systematic errors may play some role in this , the variations could well be real .",
    "one natural interpretation would be that the lmc disk plane is warped .",
    "this would , by definition , cause the inclination to vary with @xmath30 . since the line of nodes of the warp is physically unrelated to the line of nodes of the galaxy on the sky",
    ", a warp typically ( but not necessarily ) also induces a twist in the position angle of the line of nodes @xmath14 with radius . on the other hand , warping and twisting of the lmc disk plane is not the only viable explanation for the inferred radial variations in the viewing angles .",
    "it was pointed out in section  [ ss : planar ] that our models would underestimate the inclination of the lmc if its disk had a very considerable vertical thickness .",
    "so the observed radial decrease in @xmath13 could in principle be due to a radial increase in the vertical scale height of the lmc disk . while it has been found that such behavior is not typical for spiral galaxies ( e.g. , van der kruit & searle 1981 )",
    ", it is unknown whether this result holds for later type galaxies as well .",
    "in fact , alves & nelson ( 2000 ) have suggested that the vertical thickness of the lmc does indeed increase with radius , based on the fact that the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of carbon stars in the lmc disk does not fall with radius . while this may be able to qualitatively explain the ( apparent ) radial decrease in inclination , detailed modeling would be required for a more quantitative assessment of this hypothesis .",
    "a comprehensive summary of previous work on the lmc viewing angles is provided in table  3.5 of the book by westerlund ( 1997 ) .",
    "the generally quoted consensus that has emerged from these studies is that the inclination angle @xmath13 is somewhere in the range @xmath15@xmath244 , and that the position angle of the line - of - nodes is somewhere in the range @xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "the inclination angle inferred here , @xmath245 , is comfortably within the range of previously quoted values . however , the position angle of the line of nodes , @xmath246 , is very different from the values that have generally been quoted . to achieve an understanding of this discrepancy , it is useful to discuss the various methods that have previously been used to estimate the lmc viewing angles .",
    "the method that has been used most often to estimate the lmc viewing angles is what we will refer to as the ` photometric circular disk method ' .",
    "it assumes that the intrinsic shape of the lmc disk ( at large radii ) is circular .",
    "if this is true , then the major axis of the projected elliptical shape on the sky coincides with the line of nodes .",
    "since the major axis position angle @xmath10 is directly observable , this yields a simple estimate for the position angle @xmath14 of the line of nodes ; the inclination can be estimated as @xmath247 , where @xmath248 is the apparent ellipticity .",
    "this method has been applied to many of the different tracers that are available in the lmc disk , including : ( a ) optical isophotes of starlight ( de vaucouleurs & freeman 1973 ; bothun & thompson 1988 ; schmidt - kaler & gochermann 1992 ) ; ( b ) contours of the number density of stars detected in the near - ir ( weinberg & nikolaev 2000 ) , of stellar clusters ( lynga & westerlund 1963 ; kontizas et al .  1990 ) or of hii regions , supergiants , or planetary nebulae ( feitzinger , isserstedt & schmidt - kaler 1977 ) ; and ( c ) the brightness contours of hi emission ( mcgee & milton 1966 ; kim et al .",
    "1998 ) or non - thermal radio emission ( alvarez , aparici & may 1987 ) .",
    "results obtained from these studies have generally fallen in the range @xmath249@xmath244 and @xmath250@xmath12 .",
    "the variation in the results from different authors may be due in part to differences in the distance of the tracers to the lmc center , given that the lmc has considerable radial gradients in both the ellipticity and the major axis position angle of its contours ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "the main disadvantage of the photometric circular disk method is that it makes the ad hoc assumption that the lmc disk is circular .",
    "while this seems reasonable at first glance , there really is no a priori reason why galaxy disks should be circular .",
    "it is possible to construct self - consistent dynamical models for elliptical disks ( e.g. , teuben 1987 ) , and it is known that bars and other planar non - axisymmetric structures are common in disk galaxies .",
    "the dark matter halos predicted by cosmological simulations are generally triaxial ( e.g. , dubinski & carlberg 1991 ) , and the gravitational potential in the equatorial plane of such halos does not have circular symmetry .",
    "so disks are expected to be elongated , and this has been confirmed for those galaxies that have been studied in sufficient detail to address this issue ( e.g. , schoenmakers , franx & de zeeuw 1997 ) . for the lmc",
    "there is the additional argument that it is both moving in the tidal field of the galaxy and interacting with the smc , both of which may have distorted its shape .",
    "the average result obtained here from the apparent magnitude variations along rings , @xmath251 , is quite inconsistent with the values @xmath10 that have been obtained from the photometric circular disk method . in other words ,",
    "the line of nodes of the lmc is _ not _ coincident with the major axis of the distribution of disk tracers on the sky .",
    "this provides important new information on the structure of the lmc : it implies that _ the lmc disk is not intrinsically circular_. paper  ii will explore this conclusion through a detailed analysis of the lmc shape and structure .      in the ` kinematic circular disk method '",
    "the viewing geometry of the lmc is estimated by interpreting the observed line - of - sight velocities of tracers in the disk under the assumption of intrinsically circular orbits .",
    "this method has been applied to various tracers , including hi ( rohlfs et al .",
    "1984 ; luks & rohlfs 1992 ; kim et al .  1998 ) , star clusters ( freeman et al .",
    "1983 ; schommer et al .",
    "1992 ) , planetary nebulae ( meatheringham et al .",
    "1988 ) , hii regions and supergiants ( feitzinger et al .  1977 ) , and carbon - rich agb stars ( kunkel et al .  1997 ; graff et al .",
    "2000 ; alves & nelson 2000 ) .",
    "analysis yields the position angle @xmath8 of the ` kinematic line of nodes ' , defined as the line of maximum velocity gradient . for a circular model",
    "this coincides with the true line of nodes ( the intersection of the plane of the galaxy and the plane of the sky ) .",
    "the inclination is not generally well constrained by the observed velocity field , because the @xmath252 component in the observed velocities can be roughly cancelled by modifications in the ( unknown ) intrinsic rotation curve amplitude ( in the case of solid body rotation this degeneracy is complete ; see schoenmakers et al .",
    "the general procedure in the analysis has therefore often been to fix @xmath13 a priori , usually to a value estimated from the photometric circular disk method .    after correction for the transverse motion of the lmc ( e.g. , kroupa & bastian 1997 ; alves & nelson 2000 ) ,",
    "the kinematic line of nodes for the available tracers has generally been found to be in the range @xmath253@xmath12 .",
    "this is more - or - less consistent with the values inferred from the photometric circular disk method , and is inconsistent with the average result @xmath254 inferred here from the apparent magnitude variations along rings .",
    "however , if the lmc disk is elliptical instead of circular , one expects a misalignment between @xmath14 and @xmath255 ( e.g. , franx , van gorkom & de zeeuw 1994 ; schoenmakers et al .",
    "1997 ) . the hi velocity field and discussion presented by kim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) actually support this interpretation , by showing that the kinematic principle axes are not perpendicular to each other , and that @xmath8 twists by @xmath16 from small to large radii . in paper",
    "ii we discuss the kinematics of the lmc in detail , and address how the observed kinematics can be interpreted in the context of the line of nodes position angle inferred here .",
    "the most direct ( and hence most accurate ) way to determine the viewing angles of the lmc is with the ` relative distance variation method ' , for which the theoretical formalism was presented in section  [ s : theory ] .",
    "this method only uses geometry , with no assumptions about either the distribution or kinematics of tracers in the lmc plane .",
    "while the method was applied here to late - type stars , its primary use has so far been to analyze data on cepheids .",
    "several detailed studies on this topic were published in the 1980s .",
    "caldwell & coulson ( 1986 ) analyzed optical data for 73 cepheids and obtained @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "they used ` statistical reddenings ' for the majority of their stars .",
    "laney & stobie ( 1986 ) and welch et al .  ( 1987 ) both used near - ir data with individually determined reddenings , but had correspondingly smaller samples .",
    "laney & stobie obtained @xmath258 and @xmath259 from 14 cepheids , and welch et al .",
    "obtained @xmath260 and @xmath261 from 23 cepheids .",
    "these cepheid studies do not provide very strong constraints on the lmc viewing geometry , given the small sample sizes and correspondingly large statistical uncertainties . nonetheless , it is interesting to note that for the studies with smallest error bars ( caldwell & coulson 1986 ; laney & stobie 1986 ) the estimates for @xmath14 of @xmath262 and @xmath263 are significantly lower than most values that have been obtained from the photometric and kinematic circular disk methods .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the main result obtained here , and provides independent evidence that the lmc is not circular .",
    "the average value @xmath264 obtained here differs from the caldwell & coulson value at the 2-@xmath98 level , and the best - fit inclinations differ at the @xmath180-@xmath98 level .",
    "however , these differences should not necessarily be viewed as significant ; the statistical errors of caldwell & coulson may well be underestimates of the true errors , given the use of statistical reddenings instead of individually determined reddenings for the majority of their cepheids .",
    "more importantly , the accuracy of the results presented here is superior to those obtained from cepheid studies due to the much larger number of available stars and the detailed assesment of systematic effects .",
    "recent lmc surveys that search for microlensing events such as macho ( alcock et al .",
    "1999 ) , eros ( beaulieu et al .",
    "1995 ) and ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1999 ) have found of order a thousand new cepheids .",
    "these new samples should allow improvement over the older cepheid - based studies .",
    "on the other hand , these samples were obtained from observations that focused on the bar of the lmc .",
    "so they cover only small radii @xmath30 , where any distance - induced magnitude variations are expected to be small ( cf .",
    "[ [ dmagtaylor ] ] ) . also , the cepheids tend to fall , by observational construction , along the bar ( see e.g.  figure  1 of udalski et al .",
    "1999 and figure  1 of alcock et al .",
    "2000b ) , which is a linear structure on the sky .",
    "this makes it difficult to study the variation of the cepheid magnitudes as function of the azimuthal angle @xmath144 , so that the position angle @xmath14 of the line of nodes can probably only be poorly constrained .",
    "the only study so far that uses the new cepheid samples is that of groenewegen ( 2000 ) of ogle database ( udalski et al .",
    "however , his analysis is not truly based on the relative distance variation method .",
    "the position angle @xmath14 of the line of nodes is not determined from the relative distance variations of the cepheids , but is instead fixed to be perpendicular to the major axis position angle @xmath10 of the cepheid distribution on the sky , i.e. , @xmath265 plus the major axis position angle of the bar , which yields from the value quoted by groenewegen ( 2000 ) to obtain the value appropriate for the coordinate systems defined in the present paper . ] @xmath266 .",
    "the determination of the inclination angle in groenewegen s analysis is then similar to that in the relative distance variation method ; i.e. , @xmath13 is determined from the magnitude variations of the cepheids along a line perpendicular to the adopted line of nodes ( i.e. , along the bar ) .",
    "this yields @xmath267",
    ". a direct comparison of the viewing angles inferred here to those of groenwegen may not be meaningful .",
    "the cepheids in his study all fall in the inner parts of the lmc , a region that has been specifically excluded from the study in the present paper .",
    "the difference between his results and those presented here could therefore in principle be ascribed to real variations in the viewing angles as a function of radius .",
    "however , we believe that such a drastic interpretation is not called for , given that groenewegen s assumed value for @xmath14 is completely arbitrary . there is no good reason why the angle adopted by him should bear any physical relation to the actual position angle of the line nodes .",
    "it seems reasonable to attribute the fact that groenewegen s results for @xmath132 are inconsistent with those derived here ( and with the majority of all other values quoted in the literature ) to this ad hoc assumption underlying his analysis .",
    "the approach of using agb modal magnitudes to study distance variations in the lmc was used and advocated previously by weinberg & nikolaev ( 2000 ) .",
    "they selected agb stars from the 2mass survey data based on the @xmath268 color , and focused on obtaining an agb lf peak that is narrow even in the @xmath82 band .",
    "the @xmath84 cmd in the bottom right panel of figure  [ f : cmds ] shows that this rules out the use of the o - rich agb stars , which have a spread in @xmath82 magnitude of more than a full magnitude .",
    "the c - rich agb stars also spread over a full magnitude in @xmath22 , but their @xmath22 magnitudes correlate strongly with @xmath86 color .",
    "so one does obtain a reasonably narrow lf peak if one restricts the analysis to a small range in @xmath86 color .",
    "weinberg & nikolaev adopted stars with @xmath269 for their study .",
    "the denis survey has data in the @xmath20-band , which is not available with 2mass .",
    "this gives the option to select stars by @xmath23 color for the present study , which we found to yield superior statistics .",
    "nonetheless , figure  [ f : banddep ] shows that selecting stars by @xmath86 color does not yield appreciably different results .",
    "if one uses a large range of @xmath86 colors , the error bars increase only by a factor @xmath270 as compared to selection by @xmath23 color .",
    "however , weinberg & nikolaev adopted a range of @xmath86 colors that is 5 times smaller than what was used here for figure  [ f : banddep ] .",
    "as a consequence , they ended up with a much smaller sample of stars for their analysis .",
    "selection of stars with the criterion @xmath90 from the denis catalog yields @xmath102 times more stars in the agb peak than selection with the criterion @xmath271 , with no significant difference in the width @xmath98 of the agb peak .",
    "therefore , the results of the present analysis are considerably more accurate than those of weinberg & nikolaev .",
    "weinberg & nikolaev did not make a very fine subdivision of the lmc area for their study , presumably forced by the smaller statistics .",
    "they studied the lf of agb stars for 9 fields : one field on the lmc center , and 2 fields in each of the directions north , east , south and west , respectively . from their analysis they found a considerable @xmath64-gradient in the e - w direction , but no gradient in the n - s direction .",
    "from this they concluded that the position angle of the line of nodes is consistent with the value @xmath272 that they derived from the major axis position angle of the stellar number density contours .",
    "this is in direct contradiction with the results obtained here , both from denis data and from the same 2mass data .",
    "the analysis presented here yields significant gradients in both the e - w and n - s directions ( and it was verified that this is also the case if the analysis is restricted to exactly the same lmc fields as studied by weinberg & nikolaev ) .",
    "this disagreement is most likely due to the limited statistics of the weinberg & nikolaev analysis .",
    "the values of @xmath64 increase with radius @xmath30 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : maxminvar ] ) , and most of the weight in weinberg & nikolaev s results therefore comes from their 4 outermost fields at @xmath273 from the lmc center . in these fields the available numbers of stars in their analysis are 31 , 29 , 18 and 39 , in the directions n ,",
    "e , s , w , respectively ( cf .  their figures  7 and  8) .",
    "weinberg & nikolaev do not discuss at all how they derive either @xmath64 or formal errorbars @xmath274 from the stellar magnitudes , but they do show errorbars @xmath275 mag for these fields in their figure  9 .",
    "however , the results of the monte - carlo simulations discussed in section  [ ss : lfanalysis ] suggest that it is not possible to obtain estimates for @xmath64 that are as accurate as this , when only so few stars are available .",
    "a visual inspection of the lf histograms that weinberg & nikolaev present for these fields appears to confirm this .",
    "the histograms are quite unsmooth and skewed , and their peaks are in many cases significantly ( @xmath17 mag ) offset from the peaks of the smooth - kernel estimates used to estimate @xmath64 .",
    "so while the weinberg & nikolaev suggestion to use near - ir agb modal magnitudes for relative distance measurements was very important , their inferred @xmath132 values are probably not accurate .",
    "their results are certainly not supported by an analysis of similar detail as that presented here .",
    "the distance of the lmc has remained a controversial subject ( e.g. , mould et al .",
    "2000 ; udalski 2000 ) .",
    "some methods for the determination of the lmc distance are based on observations of a single object , such as sn 1987a ( panagia et al .",
    "1991 ; mccall 1993 ) , or the eclipsing binaries hv 982 ( e.g. , fitzpatrick et al .",
    "2001 ) and hv 2274 ( nelson et al .",
    "2000 ) . in such cases",
    "the results must be corrected for the relative distance @xmath276 of the object with respect to the lmc center .",
    "if ones assumes that these objects reside in the plane defined by the outer lmc disk , then @xmath277 can be calculated from equations  ( [ dsimpler ] ) and  ( [ magdif ] ) . since the viewing angles derived here differ considerably from earlier estimates , it is useful to recalculate @xmath277 for these objects . with the average values of @xmath132 derived in section  [ s : warptwist ]",
    "this yields @xmath277(sn 1987a)@xmath278 , @xmath277(hv 982)@xmath279 and @xmath277(hv 2274)@xmath280 .",
    "these corrections are all small , primarily because the objects do not lie far from the lmc center .",
    "the corrections that have previously been applied to distance determinations from these objects have been similarly small .",
    "hence , the new values for the viewing angles @xmath132 derived here do not have much impact on the previous determinations of the lmc distance scale .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of the lmc viewing angles , using the stars detected in the denis survey at distances @xmath30 between @xmath24 and @xmath281 from the lmc center . for an inclined disk one",
    "expects a sinusoidal variation in the brightness of tracers as function of position angle along a circle .",
    "we detect such brightness variations at high confidence from an analysis of the apparent magnitude of features in the near - ir cmds .",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitude of the variations is @xmath0 mag .",
    "the same variations are detected for agb stars ( using the mode of their lf ) and for rgb stars ( using the tip magnitude derived from their lf ) .",
    "they are seen consistently in all three of the denis bands , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and are seen in the data from the 2mass survey as well .",
    "any radial variations in the characteristic magnitudes of the agb stars are small ( @xmath282 mag ) .",
    "the results of these analyses and our discussions of these facts argue overwhelmingly that the observed brightness variations are due to distance variations .",
    "any complicating effects , such as possible spatial variations in dust absorption or the age / metallicity of the stellar population , do not appear to cause brightness variations at a level that exceeds the formal measurement errors ( @xmath1 mag ) .",
    "the observed spatial brightness variations are well fit by a geometric model of an inclined plane . in the best - fit model",
    "the average inclination angle is @xmath234 and the average line - of - nodes position angle is @xmath264 .",
    "the quoted errors are conservative estimates that take into account the possible influence of systematic errors .",
    "the formal errors on the viewing angles are much smaller , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "there is tentative evidence for variations in the viewing angles with distance @xmath30 from the lmc center , in the sense of there being an abrupt decrease in inclination from @xmath236 for @xmath237 to @xmath238 for @xmath239 , as well as a gradual decrease in the position angle of the line of nodes from @xmath240 for @xmath241 to @xmath242 for @xmath243 .",
    "this may indicate that the lmc disk plane is warped .",
    "the large majority of all previous studies of the lmc viewing geometry have measured either the major axis position angle @xmath10 of the spatial distribution of tracers on the sky , or the position angle @xmath8 of the kinematic major axis ( the line of maximum velocity gradient ) .",
    "these studies have generally yielded values between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for a circular",
    "disk one always has that @xmath283 , and the observationally determined values for @xmath10 and @xmath8 have therefore generally been quoted in the literature as the position angle of the line of nodes for the lmc .",
    "previous studies of spatial brightness variations of cepheids or agb stars have either not had sufficient statistics or have not been sufficiently detailed to address the lmc viewing angles with the same accuracy as obtained here .",
    "consequently , these studies have generally been interpreted as being broadly consistent with the results obtained from the distribution and kinematics of lmc tracers under the assumption of circular symmetry .",
    "our study of the lmc geometry from the distance / brightness variations of tracers in the disk is the most accurate study of its kind to date , not only in terms of formal errors , but quite importantly , also in terms of its control of possible systematic errors .",
    "this allows us to test for the first time with reasonable accuracy to what extent the assumption of circular symmetry is justified for the lmc disk .",
    "we find that @xmath14 differs considerably from both @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "this indicates that the intrinsic shape of the lmc disk is not circular , but elliptical .",
    "the inclination angle inferred here is broadly consistent with the values that have generally been quoted in the literature .",
    "however , most previous determinations were based on the incorrect assumption of circular symmetry , so this is to some extent a coincidence . in paper  ii of this series",
    "we explore in detail the implications of the newly derived viewing angles through a detailed study of the shape and structure of the lmc .",
    "we are grateful to all members of the denis consortium for their role in the collection of the denis data , and in particular to cecile loup for assisting with the most recent updates to the dcmc .",
    "part of the analysis made use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "we thank harm habing for useful discussions .",
    "the anonymous referee provided useful comments that helped improve the presentation of the paper .",
    "the construction of the denis catalog towards the magellanic clouds ( dcmc ) was discussed in cioni et al .",
    "( 2000a ) . in this appendix",
    "we discuss the accuracy of the catalog , which is of particular importance for the research presented here .",
    "we also present a new calibration scheme that was used to further improve the photometric accuracy .",
    "there are two kinds of errors in the derived stellar magnitudes : formal ( i.e. , random noise - related ) errors and systematic errors .",
    "the formal errors depend primarily on the exposure time adopted for the survey , and were discussed in cioni et al .",
    "( 2000c ) .",
    "these errors are of course largest for faint stars . however , the results in the present paper depend primarily on the properties of relatively bright agb stars with typical magnitudes of @xmath284 , @xmath285 and @xmath286 . at these magnitudes",
    "the average formal errors are very small : @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , the analysis in the present paper depends on the average magnitudes of groups of stars in the cmd .",
    "averaging reduces the influence of formal errors on the end - result by a factor @xmath287 compared to the errors for individual stars , where @xmath97 is the number of stars under consideration .",
    "formal errors therefore have a negligible influence on the analysis in this paper .    to assess systematic errors",
    "it is necessary to discuss first the denis survey strategy ( epchtein et al .",
    "the strategy has been to divide the ( southern ) sky in three declination zones , each of which was subdivided into strips at different values of right ascension ( ra ) .",
    "each strip is 12 arcmin wide in ra ( the field of view of an individual denis image ) , and @xmath288 long in declination . in the southernmost zone , which contains the magellanic clouds ,",
    "the distance in ra between the centers of adjacent strips is 1m@xmath28920s .",
    "the lmc data in the dcmc were constructed from the analysis of the 119 strips with ra between 4h@xmath28906 m and 6h@xmath28947 m .",
    "each strip is composed of 180 images at different declinations ; adjacent images overlap by 2 arcmin in declination .",
    "the 180 images are observed in a single night , and are reduced as a unit ( cioni et al .",
    "2000a ) . on average , 8 strips",
    "are observed per night , but only one or two of these cover the magellanic clouds .",
    "standard star observations are used to determine one photometric zeropoint for each night , in each of the three broad - bands @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath82 .",
    "the zeropoint , @xmath290 , is used to transform a fully calibrated ( bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , atmospheric extinction corrected , etc . )",
    "count rate per second , @xmath291 , to a magnitude , @xmath292 , using an equation of the form @xmath293 .",
    "the zeropoint @xmath290 characterizes the telescope / instrument system , and should therefore be fairly constant .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "the average and rms of the zeropoints for the strips that make up the dcmc ( observed in the four year period from december 1995 to november 1999 ) are @xmath294 , @xmath295 , and @xmath296 .",
    "close inspection of the zeropoints does show trends with time , both long - term and short term , some of which can be directly related to known changes in the telescope / instrument system ( changes in gain , instrument cleanings , etc . ) .",
    "the fact that the zeropoint is calibrated separately for each night ensures that such issues have no systematic effect on the catalog .",
    "while it is essential that the zeropoint is calibrated separately for each night , it is important to realize that each inferred zeropoint is only known with a certain formal error @xmath297 .",
    "this formal error can be estimated from the observations ( using the fact that for each night multiple standard star observations are available , each of which provides a separate estimate of the zeropoint ) .",
    "for the strips that make up the lmc data in the dcmc , the average zeropoint errors are @xmath298 , @xmath299 , and @xmath300 .",
    "these zeropoint errors are the dominant source of photometric error in the catalog .",
    "an error in the zeropoint determination for a given strip causes _ all _ the stellar magnitudes in that strip to be in error by that amount .",
    "so in this sense the errors are systematic . however , for the catalog as a whole the zeropoint errors should average to zero .",
    "hence , distance determinations using the whole catalog ( e.g. , from the magnitude of the trgb ; see cioni et al .",
    "2000c ) should not contain a systematic bias .",
    "independent information on the photometric accuracy of the catalog can be obtained from the overlap region between adjacent strips .",
    "observations for adjacent strips overlap in ra by 2 or more arcmin ( depending on declination ) , so there are many stars in each overlap region for which a magnitude determination is available from two different observations .",
    "adjacent strips were not generally observed closely separated in time ; more often than not , observations were obtained months or years apart .",
    "hence , for most realistic sources of error , the observations in adjacent strips can be considered to be independent .",
    "let @xmath143 and @xmath301 be the index numbers of two adjacent strips , and let @xmath302 and @xmath303 denote stellar magnitudes determined from the data for the respective strips .",
    "let @xmath304 be the average magnitude difference for all the stars in the overlap region : @xmath305 .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath304 indicates that there is a shift in the magnitude scale between the strips . for each set of adjacent strips we estimated @xmath304 from the data",
    "( see also figure  1 of cioni et al .",
    "2000a ) , together with a formal error @xmath306 .",
    "the rms values of the @xmath304 thus obtained are @xmath307 , @xmath308 , and @xmath309 . in an average sense , these numbers provide a direct estimate of the zeropoint error per strip , through the formula @xmath310 ( the @xmath311 arises because @xmath304 is a difference in magnitude between two strips that both have an independent zeropoint error , and because errors add in quadrature ) .",
    "this yields @xmath312 , @xmath313 and @xmath314 .",
    "these numbers are very similar to the average formal errors @xmath315 inferred from standard star observations for each strip ( see above ) , which provides a successful consistency check .    for the analysis in the present paper , which studies magnitude differences between stars in nearby areas of the sky , zeropoint errors are more of a problem than they were for previous uses of these data ( cioni et al .",
    "2000b , c ) .",
    "we therefore reconsidered the issue of zeropoint errors , and found that the inferred values @xmath304 can be used to successfully correct most of the zero - point errors in the catalog . , but only with the goal of correcting the few strips with very poor calibrations , and not with the intention of improving the calibration of the whole catalog .",
    "note in this context that it was reported there that one strip has a zeropoint error of @xmath316 magnitudes ( which was manually corrected ) .",
    "this has now been traced to a software bug that impacted only this particular strip ; this bug has now been fixed .",
    "the new calibration algorithm presented here shows that necessary zeropoint corrections are always @xmath317 mag , with @xmath318 mag being a more typical number . ] to outline the approach , let @xmath319 and @xmath320 be the true zeropoints that should ( ideally ) have been used in the reduction of the strips with indices @xmath143 and @xmath301 , and let @xmath321 and @xmath322 be the zeropoints that were actually used in the data reduction , based on the analysis of standard star observations .",
    "one can define @xmath323 non - zero values of @xmath324 and @xmath325 generally yield a shift in the magnitude scale between the strips .",
    "the observationally determined @xmath304 provide a direct constraint on this shift : @xmath326 this constraint by itself is not sufficient to determine either @xmath324 or @xmath325 . as an example , if @xmath304 is positive , one does not know whether the zeropoint for strip @xmath143 should be decreased , or the zeropoint for strip @xmath301 should be increased ( or both ) . however , equation  ( [ overlapdif ] ) is not the only constraint that is available on the values of @xmath324 and @xmath325 .",
    "the observationally determined zeropoints @xmath321 and @xmath322 have known formal errors @xmath327 and @xmath328 .",
    "hence , one must have that @xmath329 which uses the standard definition of error bars ( i.e. , @xmath324 and @xmath325 are random deviates drawn from gaussian distributions of dispersions @xmath327 and @xmath328 , respectively )",
    ". equations  ( [ overlapdif ] ) and  ( [ formalzperr ] ) provide 3 linear equations for the two unknowns @xmath324 and @xmath325 .",
    "more generally , if there are @xmath97 adjacent strips , there are @xmath330 equations for the @xmath97 unknown values @xmath331 . in the absence of other information ,",
    "the optimum solution is the one that minimizes the chi - squared quantity @xmath332 the corresponding solution is easily obtained as the least - squares solution of an overdetermined matrix equation . to obtain this solution we used a singular value decomposition algorithm from numerical recipes ( press et al .",
    "having obtained the solution @xmath333 , one can improve the zeropoint estimate @xmath322 for each strip using equation  ( [ deltadef ] ) : @xmath334 , for @xmath335 .",
    "this additional calibration was applied to the catalog before performing the analysis of the present paper .",
    "this improved calibration will be made available through the cds database in strasbourg together with the dcmc , so that it can be used in subsequent analyses of this dataset .    the @xmath96 quantity in equation  ( [ chisqcordef ] )",
    "is a sum of two terms .",
    "the first term measures how well the overlap regions between different scan strips agree .",
    "this is the quantity that one would in principle like to minimize .",
    "however , minimization of this term by itself is an ill - conditioned problem .",
    "it corresponds to application of a zeropoint offset to each scan strip to make it agree with the strip next to it .",
    "it is easy to see that this will amplify noise in a random - walk manner , and will introduce spurious large - scale gradients .",
    "the role of the second term in the @xmath96 is to avoid this .",
    "it forces the modifications @xmath336 to remain small , consistent with the formal errors in the zeropoints , and hence acts as a regularization term ( e.g. , press et al .",
    "the minimum @xmath96 solution is therefore a compromise ( in the usual sense of regularization problems ) that optimizes the agreement in the overlap regions between different scan strips , but without noise amplification and without the introduction of spurious large - scale gradients .    after applying the new calibration",
    ", one can again study the magnitude differences for stars in the overlap region of adjacent strips .",
    "one now obtains @xmath337 , @xmath338 , and @xmath339 . as discussed above , the zeropoint errors per strip",
    "can be estimated as @xmath340 times these numbers ; this yields error estimates of @xmath341@xmath218 magnitudes . having",
    "said this , it should be kept in mind that at the level of hundredths of a magnitude there may be effects other than zeropoint errors between strips that could be impacting the accuracy of the catalog . in particular , there could be zeropoint variations of this order _ within _ a given strip ( each strip , after all , is made up of 180 separate but overlapping images ) .",
    "the only information that is available on such variations comes from the variation of the magnitude differences for stars in overlap regions as function of declination . for the large majority of the strips such variations are minimal , and do not exceed the level of a few hundredth of a magnitude .",
    "however , there are a few strips where larger variations are present , presumably as a result of sub - optimal observing conditions .",
    "it was verified that none of these strips ( less than a handful ) had a significant impact on the results presented in this paper .",
    "in summary , the dcmc , especially with the improved calibration , allows highly accurate studies of the positional - dependence of features in the near - ir cmds .",
    "the results of the present study provide direct post - hoc confirmation of this , since the rms residuals in data - model comparisons such as that of figure  [ f : fits ] are no larger than @xmath1 magnitudes .",
    "also , the denis results agree at this same level of accuracy with the independent analysis of 2mass data ( cf .  figure  [ f : banddep ] ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind that none of the above discussion refers to a possible overall _ absolute _ zeropoint error in the whole catalog .",
    "such errors could , e.g. , result from possible errors in the absolute calibration of the denis photometric passbands ( fouqu et al .",
    "2000 ) , although there is currently no reason to believe that there are significant errors of this kind .",
    "if present , absolute errors would certainly impact distance determinations of the lmc .",
    "however , they would not affect the analysis presented here , which only uses _ relative _ magnitudes and distances of different areas of the lmc .",
