    "the furtherst continuous source so far observed in neutrinos is the sun  @xcite .",
    "these solar neutrinos together with their atmospheric cousins  @xcite which are produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere have in fact provided evidence for neutrino mass and oscillations .",
    "they are thus playing an important role in probing new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the only extragalactic source so far observed in neutrinos in the 10 mev range was sporadic , namely supernova 1987a .",
    "these neutrinos have extensively been used to constrain neutrino masses and oscillation parameters  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos at much higher energies , above a gev or so , have not been detected yet due to the small fluxes and cross sections .",
    "however , the disadvantage of difficult detection is at the same time a blessing because it makes these elusive particles reach us unattenuated over cosmological distances and from very dense environments where all other particles ( except gravitational waves ) would be absorbed .",
    "such neutrinos are expected to be produced , apart from more speculative mechanisms such as decay of superheavy particles , as secondary products of interactions of the well known cosmic rays in extragalactic and galactic sources as well as during propagation .",
    "these high energy neutrinos are therefore inextricably linked with the physics and astrophysics of cosmic rays .",
    "these lectures will therefore discuss high energy neutrinos together with cosmic rays .",
    "the main focus will thereby be on new possibilities opened by new experimental techniques now under consideration or already under construction , and resulting probes of new physics at very high energies beyond the electroweak scale .",
    "we thus begin with a short discussion of the now very active field of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays in general .    after almost 90 years of research on cosmic rays ( crs ) ,",
    "their origin is still an open question , for which the degree of uncertainty increases with energy : only below 100 mev kinetic energy , where the solar wind shields protons coming from outside the solar system , the sun must give rise to the observed proton flux .",
    "the bulk of the crs up to at least an energy of @xmath1ev is believed to originate within our galaxy . above that energy , which is associated with the so called `` knee '' , the flux of particles per area , time , solid angle , and energy , which can be well approximated by broken power laws @xmath2 , steepens from a power law index @xmath3 to one of index @xmath4 . above the so called `` ankle '' at @xmath5ev ,",
    "the spectrum flattens again to a power law of index @xmath6 .",
    "this latter feature is often interpreted as a cross over from a steeper galactic component to a harder component of extragalactic origin .",
    "[ fig1a ] shows the measured cr spectrum above 100 mev , up to @xmath7ev , the highest energy measured so far for an individual cr .",
    "the conventional scenario assumes that all high energy charged particles are accelerated in magnetized astrophysical shocks , whose size and typical magnetic field strength determines the maximal achievable energy , similar to the situation in man made particle accelerators .",
    "the most likely astrophysical accelerators for cr up to the knee , and possibly up to the ankle are the shocks associated with remnants of past galactic supernova explosions , whereas for the presumed extragalactic component powerful objects such as active galactic nuclei are envisaged",
    ".    the main focus of this contribution will be on ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) , those with energy @xmath8ev",
    "@xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] , and neutrinos in the same energy range , which have not been detected yet . for more details on crs in general",
    "the reader is referred to recent monographs  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "extremely high energy ( ehe)ev , while the abbreviation uhe for `` ultra - high energy '' will sometimes be used to denote @xmath9 1 eev , where 1 eev = @xmath10ev .",
    "clearly uhe includes ehe but not vice versa . ]",
    "cosmic rays pose a serious challenge for conventional theories of cr origin based on acceleration of charged particles in powerful astrophysical objects .",
    "the question of the origin of these ehecrs is , therefore , currently a subject of much intense debate and discussions as well as experimental efforts ; for a short review for the non - experts see ref .",
    "@xcite , for recent brief reviews see ref .",
    "@xcite and for a detailed review see ref .  @xcite . in sect .  2 we will summarize detection techniques and present and future experimental projects .",
    "the current theories of origin of ehecrs can be broadly categorized into two distinct `` scenarios '' : the `` bottom - up '' acceleration scenario , and the `` top - down '' decay scenario , with various different models within each scenario .",
    "as the names suggest , the two scenarios are in a sense exact opposite of each other .",
    "the bottom - up scenario is just an extension of the conventional shock acceleration scenario in which charged particles are accelerated from lower energies to the requisite high energies in certain special astrophysical environments . on the other hand , in the top - down scenario , the energetic particles arise simply from decay of certain sufficiently massive particles originating from physical processes in the early universe , and no acceleration mechanism is needed .    the problems encountered in trying to explain ehecrs in terms of acceleration mechanisms have been well - documented in a number of studies ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "even if it is possible , in principle , to accelerate particles to ehecr energies of order 100 eev in some astrophysical sources , it is generally extremely difficult to get the particles come out of the dense regions in and/or around the sources without losing much energy . currently , the most favorable sources in this regard are perhaps a class of powerful radio galaxies ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews and references to the literature ) , although the values of the relevant parameters required for acceleration to energies @xmath11 100 eev are somewhat on the extreme side  @xcite .",
    "however , even if the requirements of energetics are met , the main problem with radio galaxies as sources of ehecrs is that most of them seem to lie at large cosmological distances , @xmath12 100 mpc , from earth .",
    "this is a major problem if ehecr particles are conventional particles such as nucleons or heavy nuclei .",
    "the reason is that nucleons above @xmath13 70 eev lose energy drastically during their propagation from the source to earth due to the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect  @xcite , namely , photo - production of pions when the nucleons collide with photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the mean - free path for which is @xmath14 few mpc  @xcite .",
    "this process limits the possible distance of any source of ehe nucleons to @xmath15 100 mpc . if the particles were heavy nuclei , they would be photo - disintegrated  @xcite in the cmb and infrared ( ir ) background within similar distances .",
    "thus , nucleons or heavy nuclei originating in distant radio galaxies are unlikely to survive with ehecr energies at earth with any significant flux , even if they were accelerated to energies of order 100 eev at source .",
    "in addition , if cosmic magnetic fields are not close to existing upper limits , ehecrs are not likely to be deflected strongly by large scale cosmological and/or galactic magnetic fields thus , ehecr arrival directions should point back to their sources in the sky and ehecrs may offer us the unique opportunity of doing charged particle astronomy . yet , for the observed ehecr events so far , no powerful sources close to the arrival directions of individual events are found within about 100 mpc  @xcite . very recently , it has been suggested by boldt and ghosh  @xcite that particles may be accelerated to energies @xmath16ev near the event horizons of spinning supermassive black holes associated with presently _ inactive _ quasar remnants whose numbers within the local cosmological universe ( i.e. , within a gzk distance of order 50 mpc ) may be sufficient to explain the observed ehecr flux .",
    "this would solve the problem of absence of suitable currently _ active _ sources associated with ehecrs .",
    "a detailed model incorporating this suggestion , however , remains to be worked out .",
    "there are , of course , ways to avoid the distance restriction imposed by the gzk effect , provided the problem of energetics is somehow solved separately and provided one allows new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics ; we shall discuss suggestions based on neutrinos in sect .  3 .    on the other hand , in the top - down scenario , which will be discussed in sect .  4 ,",
    "the problem of energetics is trivially solved from the beginning . here",
    ", the ehecr particles owe their origin to decay of some supermassive `` x '' particles of mass @xmath17ev , so that their decay products , envisaged as the ehecr particles , can have energies all the way up to @xmath18 .",
    "thus , no acceleration mechanism is needed .",
    "the sources of the massive x particles could be topological defects such as cosmic strings or magnetic monopoles that could be produced in the early universe during symmetry - breaking phase transitions envisaged in grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "in an inflationary early universe , the relevant topological defects could be formed at a phase transition at the end of inflation .",
    "alternatively , the x particles could be certain supermassive metastable relic particles of lifetime comparable to or larger than the age of the universe , which could be produced in the early universe through , for example , particle production processes associated with inflation .",
    "absence of nearby powerful astrophysical objects such as agns or radio galaxies is not a problem in the top - down scenario because the x particles or their sources need not necessarily be associated with any specific active astrophysical objects . in certain models , the x particles themselves or their sources may be clustered in galactic halos , in which case the dominant contribution to the ehecrs observed at earth would come from the x particles clustered within our galactic halo , for which the gzk restriction on source distance would be of no concern .    by focusing primarily on `` non - conventional '' scenarios involving new particle physics beyond the electroweak scale ,",
    "we do not wish to give the wrong impression that these scenarios explain all aspects of ehecrs and uhe neutrinos .",
    "in fact , essentially each of the specific models that have been studied so far has its own peculiar set of problems .",
    "indeed , the main problem of non - astrophysical solutions of the ehecr problem in general is that they are highly model dependent . on the other hand ,",
    "it is precisely because of this reason that these scenarios are also attractive  they bring in ideas of new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics ( such as grand unification and new interactions beyond the reach of terrestrial accelerators ) as well as ideas of early universe cosmology ( such as topological defects and/or massive particle production in inflation ) into the realms of ehecrs where these ideas have the potential to be tested by future ehecr experiments .",
    "the physics and astrophysics of uhecrs is not only intimately linked with the emerging field of neutrino astronomy ( for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but also with the already established field of @xmath0ray astronomy ( for reviews see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which in turn are important subdisciplines of particle astrophysics ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite ) . indeed , as we shall see ,",
    "all scenarios of uhecr origin , including the top - down models , are severely constrained by neutrino and @xmath0ray observations and limits . in turn , this linkage has important consequences for theoretical predictions of fluxes of extragalactic neutrinos above a tev or so whose detection is a major goal of next - generation neutrino telescopes ( see sect .",
    "2 ) : if these neutrinos are produced as secondaries of protons accelerated in astrophysical sources and if these protons are not absorbed in the sources , but rather contribute to the uhecr flux observed , then the energy content in the neutrino flux can not be higher than the one in uhecrs , leading to the so called waxman - bahcall bound  @xcite .",
    "if one of these assumptions does not apply , such as for acceleration sources that are opaque to nucleons or in the td scenarios where x particle decays produce much fewer nucleons than @xmath0rays and neutrinos , the waxman - bahcall bound does not apply , but the neutrino flux is still constrained by the observed diffuse @xmath0ray flux in the gev range .",
    "this is true as long as the energy fluences produced in @xmath0rays and neutrinos are comparable , which follows from isospin symmetry if neutrinos are produced by pion production , because @xmath0rays injected above the pair production threshold on the cmb will cascade down to the gev regime ( see sect .  4.4 ) .",
    "the cr primaries are shielded by the earth s atmosphere and near the ground reveal their existence only by indirect effects such as ionization .",
    "indeed , it was the height dependence of this latter effect which lead to the discovery of crs by hess in 1912 . direct observation of cr primaries is only possible from space by flying detectors with balloons or spacecraft .",
    "naturally , such detectors are very limited in size and because the differential cr spectrum is a steeply falling function of energy ( see fig .  [ fig1a ] ) ,",
    "direct observations run out of statistics typically around a few @xmath19tev .    above @xmath20tev ,",
    "the showers of secondary particles created in the interactions of the primary cr with the atmosphere are extensive enough to be detectable from the ground . in the most traditional technique , charged hadronic particles , as well as electrons and muons in these extensive air showers ( eas ) are recorded on the ground  @xcite with standard instruments such as water cherenkov detectors used in the old volcano ranch  @xcite and haverah park  @xcite experiments , and scintillation detectors which are used now - a - days .",
    "currently operating ground arrays for uhecr eas are the yakutsk experiment in russia  @xcite and the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) near tokyo , japan , which is the largest one , covering an area of roughly @xmath21 with about 100 detectors mutually separated by about @xmath22 km  @xcite .",
    "the sydney university giant air shower recorder ( sugar )  @xcite operated until 1979 and was the largest array in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the ground array technique allows one to measure a lateral cross section of the shower profile .",
    "the energy of the shower - initiating primary particle is estimated by appropriately parametrizing it in terms of a measurable parameter ; traditionally this parameter is taken to be the particle density at 600 m from the shower core , which is found to be quite insensitive to the primary composition and the interaction model used to simulate air showers .",
    "the detection of secondary photons from eas represents a complementary technique .",
    "the experimentally most important light sources are the fluorescence of air nitrogen excited by the charged particles in the eas and the cherenkov radiation from the charged particles that travel faster than the speed of light in the atmospheric medium .",
    "the first source is practically isotropic whereas the second one produces light strongly concentrated on the surface of a cone around the propagation direction of the charged source .",
    "the fluorescence technique can be used equally well for both charged and neutral primaries and was first used by the fly s eye detector  @xcite and will be part of several future projects on uhecrs ( see below ) .",
    "the primary energy can be estimated from the total fluorescence yield .",
    "information on the primary composition is contained in the column depth @xmath23 ( measured in g@xmath24 ) at which the shower reaches maximal particle density .",
    "the average of @xmath23 is related to the primary energy @xmath25 by @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is called the elongation rate and @xmath28 is a characteristic energy that depends on the primary composition . therefore",
    ", if @xmath23 and @xmath27 are determined from the longitudinal shower profile measured by the fluorescence detector , then @xmath28 and thus the composition , can be extracted after determining the energy @xmath25 from the total fluorescence yield .",
    "comparison of cr spectra measured with the ground array and the fluorescence technique indicate systematic errors in energy calibration that are generally smaller than @xmath14 40% . for a more detailed discussion of experimental eas analysis with the ground array and the fluorescence technique see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .    as an upscaled version of the old fly s eye cosmic ray experiment ,",
    "the high resolution fly s eye detector has started to take data at utah , usa  @xcite . taking into account a duty cycle of about 10% ( a fluorescence detector requires clear , moonless nights ) , the effective aperture of this instrument will be @xmath29 at @xmath30eev , on average about 6 times the fly s eye aperture , with a threshold around @xmath31ev .",
    "another project utilizing the fluorescence technique is the japanese telescope array  @xcite which is currently in the proposal stage .",
    "if approved , its effective aperture will be about 10 times that of fly s eye above @xmath31ev , and it would also be used as a cherenkov detector for tev @xmath0ray astrophysics .",
    "the largest project presently under construction is the pierre auger giant array observatory  @xcite planned for two sites , one in argentina and another in the usa for maximal sky coverage .",
    "each site will have a @xmath32 ground array .",
    "the southern site will have about 1600 particle detectors ( separated by 1.5 km each ) overlooked by four fluorescence detectors .",
    "the ground arrays will have a duty cycle of nearly 100% , leading to an effective aperture about 30 times as large as the agasa array .",
    "the corresponding cosmic ray event rate above @xmath33ev will be about 50 events per year . about 10% of the events",
    "will be detected by both the ground array and the fluorescence component and can be used for cross calibration and detailed eas studies .",
    "the energy threshold will be around @xmath10ev , with full sensitivity above @xmath34ev .",
    "recently nasa initiated a concept study for detecting eas from space  @xcite by observing their fluorescence light from an orbiting wide - angle light - collector ( owl ) .",

    "interactions of uhe neutrinos with nucleons are , however , still negligible compared to interactions with the rnb because the rnb particle density is about ten orders of magnitude larger than the baryon density . the only exception could occur near grand unification scale energies and at high redshifts and/or if contributions to the neutrino - nucleon cross section from physics beyond the standard model dominate at these energies ( see sect .  3.3 below )",

    "this would potentially increase the interaction probability for any neutrino of energy within the width of the @xmath52 resonance at @xmath91ev .",
    "recently it has been suggested that the stable end products of the `` z - bursts '' that would thus be induced at close - by distances ( @xmath92mpc ) from earth may explain the highest energy cosmic rays  @xcite and may also provide indirect evidence for neutrino hot dark matter .",

    "if the uhe neutrino was produced as a secondary of an accelerated proton , the energy of the latter would have to be at least a few @xmath95ev  @xcite , making z - bursts above gzk energies more likely to play a role in the context of non - acceleration scenarios .",
    "moreover , it has subsequently been pointed out  @xcite that z production is dominated by annihilation on the non - clustered massive rnb compared to annihilation with neutrinos clustering in the galactic halo or in nearby galaxy clusters . as a consequence , for a significant contribution of neutrino annihilation to the observed ehecr flux , a new class of neutrino sources , unrelated to uhecr sources , seems necessary .",
    "this has been confirmed by more detailed numerical simulations  @xcite where it has , however , also been demonstrated that the most significant contribution could come from annihilation on neutrino dark matter clustering in the local supercluster by amounts consistent with expectations . in the absence of any assumptions on the neutrino sources ,",
    "the minimal constraint comes from the unavoidable production of secondary @xmath0rays contributing to the diffuse flux around 10 gev measured by egret : if the z - burst decay products are to explain ehecr , the massive neutrino overdensity @xmath96 over a length scale @xmath97 has to satisfy @xmath98 , provided that only neutrinos leave the source , a situation that may arise in top - down models if the x particles decay exclusively into neutrinos ( see fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] shows an example of this situation .",
    "furthermore , the z - burst scenario requires sources that are optically thick for accelerated protons with respect to photo - pion production because otherwise the observable proton flux below the gzk cutoff would be comparable to the neutrino flux  @xcite .",
    "a systematic parameter study of the required overdensity , based on analytical flux estimates , has been performed in ref .",
    "recently it has been noted that a degenerate relic neutrino background would increase the interaction probability and thereby make the z - burst scenario more promising  @xcite . a neutrino asymmetry of order unity",

    "such neutrino masses , however , require the sources to produce neutrinos at least up to @xmath95ev .",
    "uhe neutrinos from the decay of pions , that are produced by interactions of accelerated protons in astrophysical sources , must have originated within redshifts of a few .",
    "moreover , in most conventional models their flux is expected to fall off rapidly above @xmath33ev .",
    "examples are production in active galactic nuclei within hadronic models  @xcite , and `` cosmogenic '' neutrinos from interactions of uhecr nucleons ( near or above the gzk cutoff ) with the cmb ( see , e.g.,refs .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , all top - down scenarios involve the decay of x particles of mass close to the gut scale which can basically be produced in two ways : if they are very short lived , as usually expected in many guts , they have to be produced continuously . the only way this can be achieved is by emission from topological defects left over from cosmological phase transitions that may have occurred in the early universe at temperatures close to the gut scale , possibly during reheating after inflation .",

    "the defect density is consequently given by the particle horizon in the early universe and their formation can even be studied in solid state experiments where the expansion rate of the universe corresponds to the quenching speed with which the phase transition is induced  @xcite .",
    "the defects are topologically stable , but in the cosmological case time dependent motion leads to the emission of particles with a mass comparable to the temperature at which the phase transition took place .",
    "the associated phase transition can also occur during reheating after inflation .",
    "alternatively , instead of being released from topological defects , x particles may have been produced directly in the early universe and , due to some unknown symmetries , have a very long lifetime comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "in contrast to weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) below a few hundred tev which are the usual dark matter candidates motivated by , for example , supersymmetry and can be produced by thermal freeze out , such superheavy x particles have to be produced non - thermally .",
    "several such mechanisms operating in the post - inflationary epoch in the early universe have been studied .",
    "they include gravitational production through the effect of the expansion of the background metric on the vacuum quantum fluctuations of the x particle field , or creation during reheating at the end of inflation if the x particle field couples to the inflaton field .",
    "the latter case can be divided into three subcases , namely `` incoherent '' production with an abundance proportional to the x particle annihilation cross section , non - adiabatic production in broad parametric resonances with the oscillating inflaton field during preheating ( analogous to energy transfer in a system of coupled pendula ) , and creation in bubble wall collisions if inflation is completed by a first order phase transition . in all these cases , such particles ,",
    "also called `` wimpzillas '' , would contribute to the dark matter and their decays could still contribute to uhe cr fluxes today , with an anisotropy pattern that reflects the dark matter distribution in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "it is interesting to note that one of the prime motivations of the inflationary paradigm was to dilute excessive production of `` dangerous relics '' such as topological defects and superheavy stable particles .",
    "however , such objects can be produced right after inflation during reheating in cosmologically interesting abundances , and with a mass scale roughly given by the inflationary scale which in turn is fixed by the cmb anisotropies to @xmath177gev  @xcite .",
    "the reader will realize that this mass scale is somewhat above the highest energies observed in crs , which implies that the decay products of these primordial relics could well have something to do with ehecrs which in turn can probe such scenarios !    for dimensional reasons the spatially averaged x particle injection rate can only depend on the mass scale @xmath178 and on cosmic time @xmath179 in the combination @xmath180 where @xmath181 and @xmath182 are dimensionless constants whose value depend on the specific top - down scenario  @xcite , for example , the case @xmath183 is representative of scenarios involving release of x particles from topological defects , such as ordinary cosmic strings  @xcite , necklaces  @xcite and magnetic monopoles  @xcite .",

    "<S> cosmic high energy neutrinos are inextricably linked to the origin of cosmic rays which is one of the major unresolved questions in astrophysics . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the highest energy cosmic rays observed possess macroscopic energies and their origin is likely to be associated with the most energetic processes in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> their existence triggered a flurry of theoretical explanations ranging from conventional shock acceleration to particle physics beyond the standard model and processes taking place at the earliest moments of our universe . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , many new experimental activities promise a considerable increase of statistics at the highest energies and a combination with @xmath0ray and neutrino astrophysics will put strong constraints on these theoretical models . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of ultra high energy neutrinos in particular is made likely by new experimental techniques and will open an important new channel . </S>",
    "<S> we give an overview over this quickly evolving field with special emphasize on new experimental ideas and possibilities for probing new physics beyond the electroweak scale . </S>"
