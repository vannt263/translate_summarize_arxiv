    "it is well accepted that one of the primary reasons to introduce the supersymmetry is is to elucidate the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) [ 1 - 3 ] . in the sm , the existence of the neutral higgs boson",
    "is generally explained within the context of the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry is induced by the self - interactions of the sm higgs field , via the nontrivial vacuum expectation value . without supersymmetry",
    ", the mass of the sm higgs boson would acquire quadratically divergent loop corrections , requiring a cut - off scale at very high energy to confine the higgs mass at the electroweak scale .",
    "if the supersymmetry is a symmetry of nature , the loop contributions of the particles may be canceled by those of superpartners . however , since experiments have never observed yet any superparticles that have the same mass as quark or lepton , the supersymmetry can not be exact . in the presence of inexact supersymmetry , the one - loop corrections to the mass of the higgs boson is not so small but as large as 30 % of the tree - level values , due to incomplete cancelation",
    ".    there are a number of phenomenologically interesting supersymmetric models that embrace the sm .",
    "a characteristic of these supersymmetric standard models is the requirement of at least two higgs doublets , in order to give masses separately to the up - quark sector and the down - quark sector .",
    "the key role of these higgs fields is essentially the same as the sm higgs field : breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry via self interactions .",
    "the simplest one is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) [ 4 ] , which has just two higgs doublets and has been extensively studied .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm can be extended by introducing higgs singlet fields [ 5,6 ] . in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )",
    ", there is one additional higgs singlet .",
    "the motivation of introducing additional higgs singlets is mainly to solve the @xmath3 problem of the mssm [ 7 ] . in general , in terms of the vacuum expectation value of a neutral higgs singlet , the @xmath3 parameter of the mssm might be generated dynamically .",
    "besides the mssm and beyond , there are string - motivated supersymmetric models such as the supersymmetric @xmath0 model , where the gauge symmetry is decomposed from @xmath0 to @xmath4 .",
    "the two extra @xmath5 symmetries would be mixed to yield new linearly orthogonal combinations , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it is a rank-6 supersymmetric model , with two extra neutral gauge bosons .",
    "its higgs sector has two higgs doublets and two higgs singlets .",
    "phenomenology of the higgs sector of this model has been investigated by several authors [ 8,9,10,11 ] .",
    "some of us have elsewhere studied the possibility of detecting its neutral higgs bosons at the large hadron collider , assuming explicit cp violation in its higgs sector [ 11 ] .",
    "the self interactions of the higgs fields are induced by cubic and quartic couplings in the higgs potential .",
    "thus , in order to examine the higgs phenomenology of a model , it is important to know the nature of the higgs self interactions and study the possibility of measuring them . this kind of works have been performed some years ago in the sm and in the mssm by djouadi _",
    "et al_. [ 12,13 ] .    in this article , we study the higgs self couplings of the supersymmetric @xmath0 model that has been investigated in refs . [ 8,9 ] which we will call the susy @xmath0 model hereafter .",
    "we study the possibility of discovering neutral scalar higgs bosons of the susy @xmath0 model at the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "we calculate the cross section of the neutral higgs bosons produced from double higgs - strahlung process in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "we find that , for reasonable parameter values , the cubic higgs coupling of the lightest scalar higgs boson is obtained to be smaller than the corresponding coupling of the sm higgs boson .",
    "thus , the production cross section of the lightest scalar higgs boson via double higgs - strahlung process is smaller than that of the corresponding sm higgs boson .",
    "the radiative corrections to the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson due to the top and stop quark loops , combined with the negative experimental result for the neutral scalar boson search at lep2 [ 14 ] , suggest that the lightest scalar higgs boson of the present model is heavier than 112 gev . at the international linear collider ( ilc ) with the center of mass energy of 500 gev , with the integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath2 and the efficiency of 20 %",
    ", we expect that at least 5 events of the double higgs - strahlung process would be observed .",
    "the susy @xmath0 model has two higgs - doublet superfields , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and two higgs singlet superfields , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the superpotential of the model is given by [ 8.9 ] @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the right - handed top - quark superfield , @xmath14 is the left - handed quark doublet superfield of the third generation , @xmath15 is the dimensionless yukawa coupling coefficient for top quark , and @xmath16 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the bottom - quark superfield is absent as we take only the top - quark superfield .",

    "since @xmath128 ( @xmath113 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) satisfy a sum rule of @xmath133 , this implies that the pair of @xmath40 bosons couples nearly exclusively to @xmath132 in most of the parameter space and the couplings to the other heavier scalar higgs bosons are negligibly small .    the result in fig .",

    "it is worthwhile to compare this absolute lower bound on the production cross section with the corresponding results of other models .",

    "we have calculated that the absolute lower bound on the production cross section of the lightest scalar higgs boson via higgs - strahlung process in the nmssm is about 15 fb ( see the dashed curve of fig .",
    "3a in ref .",
    "thus , the absolute lower bound on the production cross section of the susy @xmath0 model is in fact larger than the corresponding value in the nmssm .",
    "it is usually anticipated that , for a supersymmetric model with several higgs singlets , the production cross section for the lightest scalar higgs boson tends to decrease as the number of higgs singlets increases , because the probability of production should be shared with other heavier scalar higgs bosons . in this respect ,",
    "the lower bound on the production cross section of the susy @xmath0 model should be smaller than that of the nmssm , since the susy @xmath0 model has one more higgs singlet than the nmssm .",

    "the cubic and quartic couplings of higgs bosons contribute when a process involves multiple higgs bosons .",

    "then , we integrate the differential cross section to obtain the total production cross section for the double higgs - strahlung process of @xmath132 , @xmath183 as a function of @xmath130 .",

    ", @xmath129 points in the parameter space .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "6 , where we take @xmath141 gev , the proposed c.m .",
    "energy of the first stage of the ilc ( ilc-500 ) .    for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also plot the corresponding sm cross section in fig .",
    "one may notice that most of the points are distributed close to the solid curve .",
    "this implies that @xmath132 behaves very much alike the sm higgs boson with respect to the double higgs - strahlung process . also , the absolute minimum of the production cross section of the lightest scalar higgs boson via the double higgs - strahlung process is about 0.05 fb at the ilc-500 .",
    "in other words , the susy @xmath0 model predicts that @xmath183 is larger than 0.05 fb , whatever the parameter values .",
    "therefore , we expect that the ilc-500 would produce at least 5 @xmath132 events for the susy @xmath0 model via the double higgs - strahlung process , if the ilc-500 has the integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath2 and the efficiency of 20 % .",
    "we have studied a supersymmetric @xmath0 model , which has two higgs doublets and two higgs singlets . in particular , we have studied the production of the lightest scalar higgs boson in @xmath1 collisions , via higgs - strahlung process and double higgs - strahlung process , for a reasonably established parameter space , at the one - loop level by considering the contributions from top and scalar top quark loops .    at the one - loop level ,",
    "the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson of the susy @xmath0 model is estimated to be between 112 and 142 gev .",
    "thus , its mass is comparable to the sm higgs boson .",
    "not only its mass but also its production cross sections in @xmath1 collisions via higgs - strahlung process and double higgs - strahlung process are found to be quite similar to those of the sm higgs boson .",
    "for the most part , this similarity may be attributed to the experimental constraints on the large masses of the extra neutral gauge bosons and the tiny mixings between them and the @xmath40 boson , the electroweak precision measurement at the lep2 experiment and the direct search in @xmath62 collisions at the tevatron .",
    "since the extra neutral gauge bosons are heavier than 800 gev and their mixing angles with the @xmath40 boson are less than @xmath184 , they are practically decoupled from @xmath40 boson , and hence from @xmath132 in the higgs - strahlung process and double higgs - strahlung process . in other words , we could assume without difficulty that only the @xmath40 boson is involved in these processes .",
    "we also find that the same experimental constraints set the lower bound on @xmath185 and @xmath186 , the vacuum expectation values of two higgs singlets , as about 1265 gev .",
    "our study on the @xmath131 coupling coefficient , the production cross section @xmath187 via higgs - strahlung process , the @xmath188 cubic coupling coefficient , @xmath189 quartic coupling coefficient , and the production cross section @xmath190 via double higgs - strahlung process show clearly the similarity of @xmath132 of our model with the sm higgs boson .",
    "thus , the contributions of heavier scalar higgs bosons are nearly negligible in these processes .",
    "consequently , the experimental constraints on the extra neutral gauge bosons make the higgs sector of the supersymmetric @xmath0 model with two higgs doublets and two higgs singlets very similar to the sm higgs sector , as far as @xmath132 is concerned .",
    "the absolute lower bound on the cross section for @xmath132 production in @xmath1 collisions via higgs - strahlung process at the ilc-500 is about 19 fb , and the absolute lower bound on the cross section for @xmath191 production in @xmath1 collisions via double higgs - strahlung process at the ilc-500 is about 0.05 fb . assuming the integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath2 and the efficiency of 20 % for the ilc-500 , at least 5 events of @xmath132 of our model might be explored at the ilc via the double higgs - strahlung process .",
