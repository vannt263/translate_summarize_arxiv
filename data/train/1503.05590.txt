    "the significant fraction ( @xmath2 ) of known exoplanets with masses of the order of the jupiter mass and orbiting within few stellar radii ( hot jupiters ) raised the question of their origin and evolution . because of their proximity to the parent star ,",
    "these planets are strongly irradiated , their upper atmospheres are bloated and do evaporate @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that the evaporating material forms a cometary tail and some sort of bow shock in front of the planet due to the interaction with the stellar wind @xcite .",
    "furthermore , interactions of tidal and magnetic nature are likely to occur in systems with hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "stars can receive angular momentum from their hot jupiters during the migration and circularization of the planet s orbit .",
    "the external input of angular momentum to the star reduces its decline with age during the main sequence due to wind losses . because of the connection between stellar activity , age and rotation",
    ", the stellar activity of the stars can be effectively boosted in presence of hot jupiters , mimicking a younger age as demonstrated for the systems of hd 189733 and corot-2a @xcite .",
    "tides can be produced on the stellar surface , with height proportional to @xmath3 so the closer is the planet the stronger is the effect , that occurs twice per orbital period .",
    "however , in extreme cases , e.g. wasp-18 @xcite , the influence of the tidal perturbation could destroy the magnetic dynamo of stars with shallow convective zones .",
    "it is also suggested that the strong tidal stresses in wasp-18 reduce significantly the mixing inside the convective zone , as evidenced by a high li abundance .",
    "this is at odds with the finding that planet host stars have depleted more li than single stars @xcite .",
    "magnetospheric interactions between planetary and stellar magnetic fields can be the source of additional reconnection events , and perturbations of the magnetic field topology . as a result",
    ", more flares could manifest in systems with hot jupiters than in single stars of the same age .",
    "furthermore , the planetary magnetic field can efficiently trap the stellar wind and its angular momentum , modifying the losses of rotation and keeping the star rotating faster than expected for its age @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported evidences of chromospheric activity phased with the planetary orbital motion in the systems of @xmath4  and , hd  179949 and hd  189733 , probed by ca h&k lines .",
    "interestingly , all cases exhibit a phase shift : the site of enhanced activity on the stellar surface is @xmath5 in the case of hd 179949 and @xmath6 for @xmath4  and leading the sub - planetary point .    in x - rays , we observed enhanced flare variability in hd  189733 after the eclipse of the planet ( @xmath7 ) in a restricted range of phases @xmath8 @xcite . the rate of such flare activity in hd  189733  is higher than in stars a few gyr old , and similar to that of pre - main sequence stars or stars more active than the sun .",
    "furthermore , this type of variability has not been observed at the planetary transits , rising the question whether hd  189733  has a prevalent x - ray activity at some orbital phases of its hot jupiter @xcite . an active spot on the stellar surface , at @xmath9 ahead of the sub - planetary point , magnetically connected with the planet , and co - moving with the planet had been hypothesized @xcite .",
    "such spot would emerge at the edge of the stellar disk when the planet is in a range of phases of @xmath8 , originating thus a phased variability .",
    "@xcite explains this phenomenon with an analytical model of the stellar field .",
    "the main hypothesis is that a magnetic link between the star and the planet exists if the planet is sufficiently close to the star as in case of hot jupiters .",
    "the lines of the magnetic field of the star could connect with the dipolar field of the planet via a bent path and generate thus the phase lag .",
    "the relative motion of the planet with respect to the star plays a key ingredient for generating such configuration . in @xcite",
    "this model is further refined , with the planet motion inducing reconnection events near the surface of the star .",
    "@xcite modeled the magnetic spi in hd  189733 including a more realistic stellar magnetic field .",
    "their magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations show that at certain phases the planet can induce reconnection events and flares if the planet encounter locally enhanced stellar magnetic field .",
    "the same model predicts the rate of exoplanet atmosphere loss , and the cometary tail that the planet motion is winding around its orbit . @xcite and @xcite modeled the interaction between planet and star by means of alfvnic waves hitting the surface of the star , generated by the planet acting as a conductor moving within the stellar magnetic field and the stellar wind .",
    "this model can reproduce well the observed phase lag of chromospheric activity which arises from the relative motion of the planet and the star .    among the systems with hot jupiters ,",
    "hd  189733  is a privileged target where to study spi effects , planet evaporation and the dynamics of the planetary gas around the host star .",
    "it is composed of a k1.5v type star as primary component ( @xmath10d , @xmath11pc from the sun ) , and an m4 companion , hd  189733  b , at 3200 au from the primary .",
    "hd  189733  a hosts a hot jupiter class planet ( hd  189733b ) at a distance of only 0.031 au ( about 8.5 stellar radii ) with an orbital period of @xmath12d @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present observations of hd  189733  obtained with the _ cosmic origin spectrograph _ ( cos ) on board hst .",
    "the aim of our observations is to obtain time resolved spectroscopy of hd  189733  at the post planetary eclipse phases , as observed with _",

    "these observation revealed the evaporation of the planetary atmosphere and an estimate of the mass loss @xcite , and asymmetry of ingress and egress implying a bow shock in front of the planet due to the interaction between the stellar wind and the planetary escaping atmosphere @xcite .",
    "motivated by our findings in x - rays , we argue that observing hd  189733  at the planetary eclipse in fuv can offer new insights on the dynamics of the gas evaporating from the planet and of the structure of the chromosphere and transition region of the star .",

    "for c  ii line at 1334.5   the centroid of the line is systematically shifted toward @xmath38 km / s , and on top of this bias we observe the same pattern of shifts as in the case of si iv lines .",
    "this systematic redshift is also seen in the archival spectra taken at the planetary transit . a more accurate de - blending analysis with iraf shows that the lines of c  ii can be fitted with two vogt profiles , one consistent with the rv shifted stellar wavelength , and the other profile red - shifted by @xmath39 km / s which is still consistent with the planetary co - moving speed ( 18.3 km / s ) , given the uncertainties of centroid estimates .",
    "similar results are obtained when using a cross - correlation technique with fxcor task in iraf .",
    "first , we subtracted spectra of exposures 5a , 5b , 5c , and 14a , 14b , 14c from the average spectrum of the orbit i ( after rebinning them a factor 4x of the original resolution ) . for each residual spectrum , a spectral portion around the c ii and si iv doublets was cross - correlated with the average spectrum of orbit i. we find that in exposures 5a , 5b , 5c the residual spectrum is red - shifted by up to @xmath40 km / s , while in exposures 14a , 14b , 14c",
    "the residual spectra are blue - shifted of @xmath41 km / s with respect to the average , basal spectrum of orbit i.      the second event of variability started at phase @xmath42 and lasted for about 400 s. it is weaker than the first event . remarkably , this event along with the x - ray flares observed in 2009 , 2011 and 2012 @xcite occurred in a very restricted range of phases ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "[ centroids ] shows that the lines and in particular si  iv and si  iii during this brightening exhibit a remarkable blue - shift , with si  iv values similar to the planetary co - moving speed ( @xmath44 km / s ) .",
    "the interpretation of this blue - shift is that hot material on the surface of the star , perhaps a hot spot at temperatures of @xmath45 , is co - moving with the planetary motion and emerging at the stellar limb .    in fig .",

    "ii , the spectral lines start to brighten simultaneously , as demonstrated by the deviation from the purely constant rate ( the linear ramp in dotted line ) . however , si iv increases its flux faster than n v and c ii lines during the first brightening .",

    "n  v line brightening starts earlier and at a faster rate than si  iv line . here",
    "c ii line starts last and it is the slowest , nearly exactly the opposite behavior than in the first brightening .",
    "the nature of the two brightenings appears different : the first is a gradual event , almost simultaneous in the three lines , and less impulsive than the second one .",
    "the bulk of plasma temperature in this event is near the peak temperature of si iv line , while relatively less plasma is present in the temperature range of the other two lines .",
    "the second event is an impulse , with hotter plasma appearing first ( t@xmath46100,000 k ) , then in a sequence intermediate temperature plasma appears ( 60,000 k ) and , eventually , plasma as cool as 30,000 k. the nature of this second event is plausible with a flaring episode due to an accreting event with a subsequent cooling of the plasma to return to the pre - flare thermal conditions . the analysis of the differential emission measure in the next sub - section helps to better understand the thermal structure of the plasma during quiescence and the two brightenings .",

    "[ dem ] ) .",
    "the comparison of the values of the quiescent dem and of the dems of the two brightenings , and the two slopes around the minimum ( occurring at @xmath48 k ) shows that during both events more plasma is contributing to the emitted spectrum in all the range of temperature .",
    "for the first event , the emitting plasma is denser and/or fills a bigger volume than in quiescent phase . during the second event",
    "the slope of the cool side of the dem is flatter and steeper than in the quiescent dem and the dem of event 1 .",
    "this means that relatively hotter plasma is present during event 2 , and less hot plasma is visible during event 1 , remarking again the different nature of the two brightenings as pointed out before by means of ecdfs .",
    "the slope of dems at high temperatures is poorly constrained , being only due to the contribution of n v doublet , and thus it is identical in all the three dems .",
    "the main feature in the cos spectra is the h i ly@xmath16 line .",
    "a detailed analysis of ly@xmath16 in spectra of solar type stars has been performed by @xcite and , for hd  189733 , by @xcite . here",
    "we attempt to a qualitative description of the ly@xmath16 as observed with cos ; however , a detailed quantitative analysis is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "the intrinsic ly@xmath16 emission of a star of spectral type of hd  189733  is difficult to assess because of the core absorption due to interstellar gas . without the narrow geocoronal emission and the strong interstellar medium ( ism ) absorption , the line would appear as a double peaked profile .",
    "the ism absorption almost fully depletes the central part of the profile , and , in addition , deuterium absorption is present at -80 km / s .",

    "the profiles of our spectra were smoothed and resampled in the same way , the airglow spectrum was scaled to the median of the five bins around the central wavelength and subtracted to our spectra .",

    "we chose these phases as representative of the behavior of the line as a function of the airglow contamination .",
    "when the airglow emission is at its maximum ( left panels in top and bottom rows ) , the correction suffers more of uncertainties , likely due to the saturation of the line peak in the detector . in the other cases",
    ", the correction seems more effective and the double peaked profile is recovered .    in almost all cases , the red peak is higher than the blue peak , as observed sometimes in other stars ( see fig . 6 of @xcite ) the reason is likely due to the shape of the interstellar absorption being more effective in the blue wing of the line while the extra deuterium absorption has a narrow effect in the blue portion at around -80 km / s @xcite .",

    "we obtained time resolved spectroscopy with cos around ly@xmath16 and we observed two intense line brightenings . a similar strong variability has been observed previously in the same phase range in x - rays @xcite . at these planetary phases",
    "the star systematically manifests an extraordinary rapid variability in the form of fuv brightenings and x - ray flares .",
    "while these events seem typical for an active star , the restricted phase range in which they manifest is anomalous and strongly points to an activity phased with the motion of the hot jupiter around its host star .",
    "hd  189733  behaves markedly active when the planet is emerging from its eclipse .",
    "of support to this phenomenon is the fact that multiple observations of hd  189733   obtained at the planetary transits both in fuv and x - rays @xcite did not show similar levels of variability ( being this of order of @xmath51 sigma level ) , and raising the question of why the star is more active when the planet is emerging from its eclipse .    in the following ,",
    "we propose a scenario where the planet is inducing a relatively compact hot spot on the stellar surface , which benefits from limb brightening at specific post - eclipse phases .",
    "in particular ,  we argue that such phased fuv brightenings and x - ray flares  could be likely the signature of star - planet interaction in the form of material evaporating from the planet , and accreting onto the star ,  as suggested by recent 3d magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations by @xcite , (  see also @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical model is setup in pluto @xcite , and includes a magnetized stellar wind , as well as a planetary outflow , with the stellar and planetary magnetic fields assumed to be @xmath52@xmath53 g and @xmath52@xmath54 g , respectively .",

    "submitted , for a classification of star ",
    "planet interactions ) , photo - evaporation drives a strong outflow from the surface of the hot jupiter , which becomes supersonic and collides with the stellar wind .",
    "the shocked material is slowed down by the surrounding stellar plasma , and is dragged inwards by gravity forming a spiral - shaped trajectory . as a result , the accreting flow impacts onto the stellar surface at a location that precedes the sub - planetary point .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ mhd_stream ] shows a close - up of the accretion region .",
    "the effects of the stellar wind and gravity funnel the ionized stream through an almost radial trajectory towards the star ( point a , right panel of fig .",
    "[ mhd_stream ] ) .",
    "the motion of the infalling material is obstructed by the pressure ( thermal plus magnetic ) of the stellar corona at a finite height above the stellar surface ( point b ) .  at that location , the flow forms a hot and dense structure ( the `` knee '' ) , with number densities up to @xmath55@xmath56 .",
    "recent planetary outflow models from @xcite suggest @xmath57 times higher mass loss rates than @xcite , which would increase the knee density value found in our simulation .",
    "in addition , cooling mechanisms could also contribute to condense the gas .",
    "note that the whole spiral - shaped stream corotates with the hot jupiter , and hence , both points a and b rotate around the star with an angular velocity similar to that of the planetary orbit ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "however , the material that accumulates in point b experiences the drag of the slower rotating star ( @xmath59 ) , and as a result , it loses its angular momentum and lags behind .",
    "in addition , the local pressure distribution pushes the gas to the right , leading to the formation of the `` knee '' structure highlighted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ mhd_stream ] .",
    "the material then accretes onto the star , impacting the chromosphere at point c.  a visual inspection suggests that point c precedes the location of the planet by about @xmath1 .",
    "as the planet orbits around the star , point c is continuously relocated , effectively corotating with the planet ( but the accreted material should acquire the rotation of the star after the impact on the surface ) . due to the weaker magnetic fields of main sequence stars , the accreting plasma is not expected to impact at high latitudes as in protostars .    for the discussion that follows , consider the observer ( earth ) to be on the left side of fig .",
    "[ mhd_stream ] ( the line of sight is depicted with an arrow in the left panel ) , thus observing the planet after its eclipse . at phase @xmath60 , the elongated structure of hot material in point b",
    "is approximately aligned with the line of sight . since the plasma motion is receding with respect to the observer with a velocity of @xmath61@xmath62 , its emission will appear redshifted .",
    "shortly after , the impact region ( point c ) appears at the stellar limb along the line of sight .",
    "the hot spot moves towards the observer with the angular velocity of the planet , corresponding to a local speed of @xmath63@xmath64 that will blueshift the emitted radiation .",
    "+    in this context , we find a plausible match between the accretion features in the mhd simulations and the fuv observations .",
    "the first brightening can be attributed to the _ knee _ coming into view approximately when the planet is emerging from the eclipse ( point b ) .",
    "the observed redshift is in agreement with the simulation where the flow is receding along the line of sight .",
    "because of the shock which is likely to form there , the gas in the knee is expected hotter than the average temperature of the transition region , but still cooler than the gas impacting on the surface of the star .",
    "the second brightening can be attributed to the spot emerging later at the limb , which is due to the impact of the accreting gas onto the chromosphere .",
    "it is plausible to imagine that the accreting spot is forced to move with the co - moving speed of the planet at the stellar surface ( @xmath65 km / s ) , since the stream inherits the angular speed of the orbit . as a result ,",
    "a blueshift of the lines is observed because the spot is moving toward the observer , and at a rate that is faster than the rotational velocity of the stellar surface ( 3.4 km / s ) .",
    "note that secondary flows may detach from the main body of the stream and fall onto the surface with minor impacts . nevertheless , the spot of the bulk accretion remains confined in a restricted range of planetary orbital phases , and remains within the range of phases in which we observed variability in _ xmm - newton _  and in the present hst observations .",
    "the accreting stream is moving in an elongated magnetized region ( marked by points a and b of fig .",
    "[ mhd_stream ] ) that can host magnetic reconnection ( and thus flaring activity ) .",
    "the relevant size is markedly different from the typical sizes of coronal loops of main sequence stars like the sun .",
    "an estimate of the size of such long structures has been inferred from the analysis of the decay light curve of a flare observed in x - rays @xcite , and it is of a few stellar radii . from the simulations , we estimate that the stream forms an arc before the knee of the size of the @xmath66 stellar radii , and the knee is about @xmath67 stellar radii above the stellar surface . the mass flux through the knee is estimated of order of a few units of  @xmath68 gr s@xmath69 @xmath70 . from this mass flux , assuming an accreting tube with section of @xmath71 , we estimate a mass accretion from the planet of  @xmath72 gr yr@xmath69 , or up to about  1% of a jupiter mass in @xmath73 gyr , if the accretion were steady during this period of time .    we warn that the numerical model does not have adequate resolution to model in detail the path of the plasma flowing from point b to c ( limited by the demanding nature of 3d mhd simulations ) . the precise location of the spot ( point c ) may vary slightly due to the time - dependence of the plasma dynamics .",
    "it is plausible that the accretion is not happening in form of a continuous flow , but instead , the plasma accumulates until the density of the gas excedes the confining pressure of the magnetic field , and mimicks the fall of dense fragments observed just after the solar eruption of june 7 2011 @xcite .",
    "the limitations of the numerical simulation prevented us also from following in detail the impact onto the stellar surface .",
    "the surface is treated as a boundary which does not physically describe the chromosphere , but rather the base of the stellar wind .",
    "such mhd simulations of systems harboring hot jupiters differ from previous simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) in the treatment of the stellar and planetary winds .",
    "they also differ from analytical models of purely magnetic star - planet interaction @xcite .",
    "however , all these modeling attempts concur to qualitatively describe a preferred planetary phase range in which stellar activity is enhanced by magnetic reconnection , or , by accreting material , as in the model presented above from @xcite .    stars accrete material from their circumstellar disks during the pre- main sequence phase , and , depending on the rate of accretion , they are identified as classical t - tauri ( cttss , strong accretors ) and weak - line t - tauri ( wttss , weak accretors ) .",
    "given that we make the hypothesis that hd  189733  is accreting material from its hot jupiter , a comparison between the spectrum of hd  189733  and cttss / wttss stars is in order . @xcite",
    "present an extended and thorough analysis of fuv spectra of a sample of cttss and wttss .",
    "they recognize a broad and a narrow components in the c iv , si iv and n v lines , with the relative weight of the narrow to broad component varying between 20% and 80% as a function of the accretion rate . the lines of wttss are shaped mainly by a low redshifted , narrow component .",
    "c iv lines are redshifted in both cttss and wttss , with the redshift being of order of 10 km / s in wttss .",
    "fuv lines of hd  189733  differ from those of cttss and wttss . in hd  189733",
    "we observe narrow lines like in wttss and a systematic redshift of c ii lines that is usually associated with emission from the gas flowing down in the coronal loops .",
    "we find similarities between the spectral features of hd  189733  and the fuv spectrum of the solar eruption of june 7 2011 .",
    "the solar event has been analyzed in detail by @xcite .",
    "this unusual eruption showed the break of a dense filament that ejected dense fragments eventually falling down on the solar surface .",
    "the dynamics of this eruption is the best template for accreting events in pre main sequence stars @xcite and , in our case , for hd  189733 .",
    "the brightenings of c iv doublet at 1550  were modeled by @xcite by means of a cloud of fragments hitting the top of the chromosphere . among the results ,",
    "@xcite explain the broad component of fuv lines in accreting stars as due to the accretion taking place simultaneously at different locations on the stellar surface .",
    "they also do not find a continuum increase in the reconstructed spectra of the impacting fragments . in solar flares due to magnetic reconnection ,",
    "a rise of the continuum flux is observed as due to the heating process and the rise of the free - bound and free - free contributions @xcite .",
    "the lack of continuum flux increase in the brightenings we observed in hd  189733  is analog to the solar behavior during the impacts of the dense fragments after their eruption . by means of ecdfs",
    "we have established in sect .",
    "[ secondevent ] that the second event has an impulsive nature .",
    "the lack of continuum increase during this brightening is analog to the lack of continuum increase in the solar event described above .",
    "this allows us to consider the second brightening in hd  189733  as an accretion event of planetary material similar to the solar event rather than a flare due to magnetic interaction and/or reconnection . on the other hand ,",
    "the first event is rather due to the emergence of a hotter , elongated region ( knee ) briefly seen through a favorable line of sight .    on the wider context of systems with hot jupiters , the conditions for establishing a steady accreting stream strongly depend on  the stellar wind , the intensity  and geometry of the stellar magnetic field , the stellar activity ( related to the magnetic activity ) , and the separation of star and planet ( which controls also the rate of evaporation of the planetary atmosphere ) .",
    "in this respect , hd  189733  demonstrates to be one of the most favorable systems where this phenomenon can be detected .",
    "the presence of a multi - year activity cycle  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , associated with a variability of reconnection events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implies alternating periods of active accretion and periods of weak or absent accretion . as a consequence ,",
    "an activity cycle would explain lack of systematic phased variability when observing stars after a few years , and the on / off behavior observed in the case of hd  179949 @xcite .",
    "we find unlikely that the two events are related to hot material emitting close to the planet .",
    "such material should be ejected from the planet and inherit a velocity of at least 150 km / s which is the orbital velocity of the planet .",
    "similar velocity should be involved in magnetic reconnection events close to the planet . at phases 0.52 and 0.59",
    "the components of such velocity along the line of sight are @xmath74 km / s and @xmath75 km / s , respectively . in both cases",
    "we should see a blue shift when observing after the planetary eclipse . at phase 0.52",
    "we observe a redshift of about + 20 km / s , thus a difference of @xmath76 km / s with respect to the expected doppler shift of emission from gas close to the planet . for the second event at phase 0.59 , the expected blue shift of -80 km / s from material close to the planet .",
    "such blue shift is not detected in any of the lines .",
    "spi events should be synced with the synodic period of the star+planet system which is about 2.7 days .",
    "this value is quite close to the orbital period of the planet , thus disentangling this effect from other effects purely related to the planetary motion is difficult .",
    "in addition it would require a continuous monitoring of the star for at least 3 synodic periods , which is a demanding observational effort not realized to date .",
    "in this paper we have presented a time resolved spectroscopic analysis of the fuv spectrum of hd  189733  acquired with cos on board hst , around the ly@xmath16 line in the range 1150 - 1450 .",
    "we have observed the phases after the planetary eclipse , for a duration of five hst orbits .",
    "the spectral range comprises several lines of ionized si , c , n and o , which form in the range of temperature of @xmath77 k , typical of the transition region .",
    "two rapid line flux brightenings have been observed in si , c , and n lines with a duration of @xmath78 s. no similar brightenings have been observed in archival observations of hd  189733  taken with the same instrument at a planetary transit .",
    "the first event happens when the planet is emerging after the eclipse ( phase @xmath60 ) , the second event later at phase @xmath35 . from the line ratios of si ions , and with a reconstruction of the differential emission measure",
    ", we followed the evolution of the plasma temperature and the rise of temperature during both events .",
    "the time evolution of the line fluxes is different and hint to a different nature of the two events : the evolution of the first event has been gradual within 400 s. the second event has been a rapid impulse observed first in the hot lines of n  v , and then in the cooler lines of si iv and c ii . the second event has been also hotter than the first one . for the second event ,",
    "we find a strong similarity with the impacts of dense fragments during the solar eruption of june 7 2011 .",
    "in particular , both events are impulsive and lack of continuum increase , at odds with solar and stellar flares due to magnetic reconnection .    with the help of mhd simulations",
    ",  we argue that the spectroscopic sequence is the signature of gas that evaporates from the planet and accretes onto the star .",
    "in particular , the mhd simulations show that material  can effectively escape the planetary surface , becomes supersonic , and collides with the stellar wind .",
    "the interaction leads to the formation of an elongated spiral - shaped stream that precedes the planetary motion , and a cometary - type tail that trails the orbit . near the star ,",
    "the stream is funneled by the surrounding magnetized plasma , and infalls almost radially . the flow is then obstructed by the coronal pressure at a finite height above the stellar surface , possibly forming a shock . the dynamical evolution",
    "then leads to the formation of a `` knee '' structure of dense and hot plasma , that is subsequently channeled inwards and impacts onto the stellar surface . as a consequence ,",
    "the knee region and the surface accretion spot are hotter and denser than the average transition region of the star .",
    "since the entire accreting stream is co - rotating with the planet , the phased variability occurs when  under favorable alignment with the line of sight  the knee and the accretion spot emerge at the stellar limb .",
    "the phase angle between the accretion spot and the sub - planetary point matches quite well the observed phase lag in x - ray and fuv activity .",
    "this scenario is appealing because it can explain both x - ray and fuv observation after the planetary eclipse .",
    "these observations provide the spectroscopic signatures of the accreting planetary gas . however , further monitoring at the post planetary eclipse phases  and on longer time baseline are needed to confirm the systematic occurrence of such spectroscopic signatures and the enhanced activity of hd  189733  at these particular phases .",
