    "a theory of quantum gravity should not apply only to asymptotically locally anti - de sitter ( alads ) spacetimes . for this reason , the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , although immensely successful , has fallen short of a description of the quantum mechanics of spacetime .",

    "if a quantum theory applies to general spacetimes , it is desirable that it reduces to ads / cft in the appropriate cases .",
    "this suggests a strategy for guessing properties of a complete theory : consider specific aspects of ads / cft and devise generalizations that are applicable to other spacetimes .",
    "if one knew only of special relativity , she could guess aspects of general relativity by thinking to `` promote '' the flat metric to a dynamical one .",

    "below we describe a promotion of holographic entanglement entropy beyond the scope of ads / cft that applies just as well to cosmological spacetimes as it does to asymptotically ads spacetimes . in the case of the latter , it reduces to the hrt proposal .",
    "moreover , the promoted holographic entanglement entropy satisfies , for nontrivial reasons , expected properties of entanglement entropy like strong subadditivity .",
    "the hrt prescription provides a way to compute entanglement entropy of a spatial region @xmath0 in a quantum state dual to an alads spacetime .",
    "the procedure is to consider @xmath1 , the boundary of the spatial region , and to find the area of a codimension 2 extremal surface that is anchored to @xmath1 .",
    "a nave extension of this idea to general spacetimes would be to take @xmath0 to be a region in the conformal boundary of an arbitrary spacetime .",
    "this approach fails : what is the boundary of a closed frw universe with past and future singularities ?    in our proposal , we anchor extremal surfaces to a _ holographic screen_. holographic screens are codimension 1 surfaces that appear to be the most natural place for quantum states dual to arbitrary geometries to live on .",

    "* _ reduction to the hrt proposal . _",
    "as explained in detail in @xcite , the ads boundary can be regarded as a holographic screen . in this case , surfaces of constant time in the dual field theory correspond to leaves , and our proposal becomes identical to the covariant holographic entanglement entropy conjecture of @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to state our conjecture about the role of @xmath46 in quantum gravity .",
    "this conjecture is the primary concern of this paper .",
    "nonetheless , we emphasize that the mathematical developments below ( e.g. the proof that @xmath46 satisfies standard properties of von neumann entropy ) do not rely on any conjectural statements .",
    "our proposal can be regarded as an extension of a covariant holographic principle due to bousso which we now review very briefly . in @xcite , bousso integrated the ideas of @xcite with his covariant entropy conjecture @xcite and proposed that each marginal surface @xmath4 foliating a holographic screen is associated with a hilbert space @xmath53 of dimension @xmath54 and that states in @xmath53 holographically define the state on a null surface @xmath55 passing through @xmath4 in the marginal direction . for our purposes ,",
    "this holographic principle takes the following form .",
    "to each leaf @xmath14 of a past or future holographic screen we assign a density matrix @xmath56 .",
    "the density matrix acts on a hilbert space of dimension @xmath57 which may be a subspace of a `` complete '' hilbert space .",
    "the covariant entropy bound suggests that @xmath56 encodes the quantum information on the null slice generated by @xmath15 and @xmath58 where @xmath15 is the null vector field with @xmath17 on @xmath14 .",
    "we now assume bousso s holographic principle and state our new conjecture .",
    "we propose that every region @xmath0 of @xmath14 ( up to string scale resolution ) corresponds to a subsystem of the hilbert space that @xmath56 acts on .",
    "we conjecture that the von neumann entropy of that subsystem in the density matrix @xmath56 is given , at leading order , by @xmath46 as we have defined it in equation [ entropydef ] .",
    "we refer to this statement as the _ screen entanglement conjecture_. because a holographic quantum theory dual to arbitrary spacetimes is not known , the screen entanglement conjecture is not a mathematical statement about the relation between two known theories ( as in the case of hrt ) . instead , our conjecture suggests a way to compute properties of quantum states in an unknown theory .",
    "it is our hope that this will , in fact , be a step toward developing a quantum theory for arbitrary spacetimes .",
    "it was emphasized above that in a given spacetime , there is no unique preferred holographic screen . as a consequence ,",
    "screen entanglement entropy can not even be defined before first deciding on a particular choice of a screen .",
    "this might seem to put the screen entanglement conjecture on haphazard footing , but we explain here why this arbitrariness is , in fact , a necessary feature of any generalization of holographic entanglement entropy to general spacetimes .    conventional holographic entanglement entropy in ads / cft is reference frame dependent in the following sense . consider an observer in an asymptotically ads spacetime @xmath2 with conformal boundary @xmath59 following a worldline @xmath60 . here",
    ", @xmath61 is the proper time parameter of the observer . at a given value of @xmath61",
    ", we can consider a spacelike _ cut _ of the boundary @xcite : @xmath62 here , @xmath63 denotes the causal past of a point @xmath64 .",
    "a region @xmath65 on @xmath66 can be specified by considering a portion @xmath67 of a small sphere on the tip of the past light cone of the point @xmath60 and following points in @xmath67 down null geodesics until @xmath59 is reached .",
    "thus , once the trajectory @xmath60 is decided upon , we can use the hrt formula to compute @xmath68 , the holographic entanglement entropy of the region @xmath65 on the cut @xmath66 .",
    "if the trajectory is changed , @xmath68 correspondingly transforms . at the level of the dual cft",
    ", this discussion corresponds to the fact that quantum states and their time - dependence have a gauge - redundancy that is fixed by making a choice of time - slicing on the boundary @xmath59 .    in the case of the screen entanglement conjecture and a spacetime that is not asymptotically ads ,",
    "a null foliation must be selected to fix a holographic screen . as discussed above , a simple way to do",
    "this is to choose a curve @xmath60 , and , at any given @xmath61 , follow along the past light - cone of @xmath60 until a marginal surface @xmath69 is obtained .",
    "the role of @xmath69 is analogous to that of the cut @xmath66 in asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "the foliation dependence of screen entanglement entropy is closely tied to the frame - dependence of the hrt formula .",
    "this is an example of `` fixing the gauge '' in quantum gravity , a concept developed in @xcite .    in the case of asymptotically ads spacetimes ,",
    "no matter what worldline @xmath60 is chosen , the union of all of its cuts will always be a subset of the boundary .. however , in some cases past directed null geodesics of @xmath60 may fail to reach @xmath59 . ] in general spacetimes however , the particular holographic screen obtained by taking the union over all @xmath61 of @xmath69 will depend on the choice of the worldline .",
    "thus , the surface on which holographic quantum states are defined is no longer tethered to the spacetime .",
    "this is a basic property of bousso s holographic principle , not one that arises only in the more extended framework of this paper .",
    "we regard this aspect of holographic screens as being in the spirit of black hole complementarity , where quantum information is not attached to a fixed spacetime position ( e.g. a qubit is not inside or outside a black hole ) until an observer is selected to describe the system .",
    "in this section we prove key technical results about holographic screen entanglement entropy including many of the properties advertised above .",
    "the notation and conventions we will use are the same as those given in section [ section2 ] . in particular , @xmath6 is a past holographic screen in a globally hyperbolic spacetime of dimension @xmath3 that satisfies the genericity conditions of @xcite .",

    "the effect of increasing @xmath61 is simply to bring @xmath280 closer to the bifurcation sphere on the de sitter horizon .",

    "what we have proven so far is that an extremal surface exists with area almost equal to that of @xmath0 ( or @xmath287 ) .",

    "however , numerical data that suggests that the static sphere approximation is accurate at large @xmath61 as we will now see .    as explained above , the cosmological spacetimes we have been discussing have vacuum energy @xmath254 as well as some matter content that dilutes at late time .",
    "the simplest case of this is when the universe is flat ( @xmath318 ) and when the additional matter content consists of only one species with density @xmath319 and pressure @xmath320 .",

    "the coordinate @xmath247 takes values from @xmath261 to @xmath331 .",
    "we put one species of matter content in the spacetime that satisfies @xmath332 which gives rise to a big bang at @xmath256 as well as a big crunch .",
    "as before , we introduce a conformal time coordinate @xmath238 in terms of which the scale factor is @xmath333 where @xmath334 and @xmath277 is constant .",
    "this shows that the penrose diagram for this spacetime is a rectangle with a time - to - space aspect ratio of @xmath64 .",

    "as suggested by the figure , the holographic screen is given by @xmath335 however , a subtlety arises because the screen is a past holographic screen for @xmath336 and a future screen for @xmath337 . the sphere that connects",

    "the proposal we have given above may open the door to a new research program : the study of the entanglement structure of general spacetimes . in light of this , and for the sake of clarity , we now summarize the recipe for computing von neumann entropy under the assumption of the screen entanglement conjecture discussed in section [ section2 ] :    1 .   select a particular null foliation @xmath344 of a spacetime with dimension @xmath3 .",

    ".    potential applications of our conjecture are numerous .",
    "one example not considered above is case of a spacetime with a black hole .",
    "black holes formed through the collapse of matter possess future holographic screens in their interiors that approach their horizons at late times .",
    "it is of potential significance to investigate the entanglement structure of such spacetimes .",
    "perhaps such an analysis will shed light on the firewall paradox @xcite .",
    "if the screen entanglement conjecture is correct , it should still only be regarded as a leading order prescription for the computation of von neumann entropies .",
    "a version of the analysis of @xcite may be extendible to the context of holographic screens .",
    "it is not completely obvious how this should be done .",
    "if @xmath0 is a region in a leaf @xmath14 lying on a cauchy slice @xmath35 , one may consider the region on @xmath35 bounded by @xmath0 and its extremal surface @xmath47 and compute the entanglement entropy of this region in a quantum field theory on the spacetime background . on the other hand",
