    "the understanding of spin - dependent effects in inclusive hadron production processes in the framework of qcd is still far from being satisfactory , despite significant experimental and theoretical progress over the past few years . in particular",
    ", the study of hyperon polarization ( @xmath13 ) and the analyzing power ( @xmath11 ) could provide invaluable and completely new insight into the field of `` spin physics '' and , in addition , might also yield a better understanding of the hadronization process .    in this paper we will study the existing data for one measured spin - dependent quantity ( transverse hyperon polarization @xmath13 in inclusive reactions @xmath14 ) from an empirical point of view in collisions of unpolarized protons , antiprotons , @xmath15 , @xmath16 or hyperons with protons or nuclei .",
    "experiments on hyperon production performed during more than two decades since the first polarization observation @xcite have shown that the hyperon polarization is significant in a wide range of beam energies . almost all the existing data ( with an equivalent proton momentum on a fixed target from 4 up to 2049 gev / c ) at medium and high energies are used for the analysis .",
    "the study of @xmath9 hyperon polarization in @xmath17 and @xmath18 collisions has been carried out in many experiments and revealed an approximate scaling behaviour as a function of @xmath7 variable at fixed @xmath0 , as well as a function of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath7 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "further investigations of the hyperon and proton polarization using different beams and targets have shown its dependence on the hyperon and the beam flavors , as well as on the target atomic weight @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has to be mentioned that a large value of the hyperon polarization represents a significant problem for the existing strong interaction theory which predicts , in the framework of pertubative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) , the vanishing of the polarization at high @xmath0 and energy @xcite . for the review of the hyperon polarization data and the existing models",
    "see @xcite .",
    "recently a new scaling law has been proposed for a hadron production analyzing power ( @xmath11 ) in reactions @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are hadrons , and the hadron @xmath20 is transversely polarized @xcite .",
    "since the hyperon polarization and the hadron analyzing power could be closely related @xcite , it is reasonable to expect that similar scaling properties take place for the inclusive hyperon production in collisions of unpolarized hadron beams with protons or nuclei . according to ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath11 at high energies ( @xmath23 gev ) and high transverse momentum @xmath0 ( @xmath24 gev / c ) can be described by a simple function of two variables , @xmath0 and @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 here , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are four - momenta of the produced hadron , the target hadron and the beam hadron , respectively .",

    "there are also alternative expressions for the scaling variable @xmath25 , which are close to ( [ eq : xa ] ) numerically at the high beam and secondary hadron energies @xcite .",

    "the hyperon polarization features are different in some respects from the analyzing power features listed in @xcite .",

    "the effect arises when the direction of the force acting on a quark does not coincide with the direction of its motion .",
    "it leads to a rotation of the quark spin and could be the reason of the discussed above `` oscillation '' of polarization or analyzing power as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "the thomas frequency is an inverse function of a quark mass @xmath485 where @xmath486 is the strange quark velocity , @xmath487 - the force , @xmath488 - the strange quark mass , and @xmath489 .",

    "there are also many predictions for hyperon polarization in other reactions .",

    "it is also a statement that two partons with similar wave functions in the proton may interact with themselves differently not as they interact with a parton whose wave function is different .",
    "this results in a simple rule : slow partons preferentially recombine with their spins down in the scattering plane while fast partons recombine with their spins up .",
    "the model predicts correctly the polarization sign but not the magnitude for some of the reaction .",
    "so , the model predicts the same polarization magnitude for @xmath501 as it is for @xmath502 , but we know from the above analysis that the polarization magnitudes for @xmath503 are two times smaller .",
    "similarly , for @xmath249 process the model predicts the same magnitude as for @xmath501 , while the measured value is two times larger . since the polarization in the model is essentially kinematic at the quark level all the antibaryons should have zero polarization .",
    "as we have seen in the above analysis , the experimental situation is much more complicated .",
    "there is another estimate of the hadronization time which follows from the analysis of @xmath35-dependence of hadron production @xmath504 , where @xmath505 gev @xcite .",

    "this example shows that the hyperon polarization is sensitive to the details of the hadronization process .",
    "these results seem to imply that the origin of hyperon polarization is closely related with the confinement mechanism .",
    "since the thomas precession frequency is an inverse function of the quark mass @xmath488 , this may be the reason for a large variation of the @xmath358 parameter for different reactions . the ratio @xmath508 is estimated to be from 17 to 25 with a mean about 21 @xcite .",
