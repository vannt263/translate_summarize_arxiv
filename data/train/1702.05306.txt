    "we call such a decomposition a _ heegaard splitting _ for the manifold @xmath3 and denote it by @xmath10 . the surface @xmath11",

    "the _ mapping class group of a heegaard splitting _ for a manifold is the group of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms of the manifold that preserve each of the two handlebodies of the splitting setwise .",
    "we call such a group the _ goeritz group _ of the splitting , or a _ genus-@xmath6 goeritz group _ when the splitting has genus @xmath6 as well .",
    "further , when a manifold admits a unique heegaard splitting of genus-@xmath6 up to isotopy , we call the goeritz group of the splitting simply the _ genus-@xmath6 goeritz group _ of the manifold without mentioning a specific splitting .",
    "we note that the mapping class group of a heegaard splitting is a subgroup of the mapping class group of the heegaard surface .",
    "it is important to understand the structure of a goeritz group , in particular , a finite generating set or a finite presentation of it if any .",
    "for example , using a finite presentation of the genus-@xmath0 goeritz group of the 3-sphere given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , it is constructed a new theory on the collection of the tunnel number-@xmath13 knots in @xcite .",
    "further , it has been an open problem whether the fundamental groups of the spaces of genus-@xmath0 heegaard splittings of lens spaces are finitely generated / presented or not , see @xcite . if the genus-@xmath0 goeritz groups are shown to be finitely presented , then so are those fundamental groups .    in @xcite a finite presentation of the genus-@xmath0 goeritz group of @xmath14",
    "was obtained , and in @xcite finite presentations of the genus-@xmath0 goeritz groups were obtained for the connected sums whose summands are @xmath14 or lens spaces .",

    "we show that the genus-@xmath0 goeritz group of each of those lens spaces is again finitely presented and obtain an explicit presentation , which is introduced in theorem [ thm : presentations of the goeritz groups for non - connected case ] in section [ sec : main_section ] .",
    "the manifold which admits a genus-@xmath0 reducible heegaard splitting is one of the @xmath1-sphere , @xmath14 , lens spaces and their connected sums .",
    "therefore , theorem [ thm : presentations of the goeritz groups for non - connected case ] together with the previous results mentioned above implies the following .",
    "the mapping class group of each of the reducible heegaard splittings of genus-@xmath0 is finitely presented .    in other words",

    "and then we calculate the isotropy subgroups of each of the simplices of the quotient , and express the goeritz group in terms of those subgroups .    for the genus-@xmath0 heegaard splitting @xmath10 of a lens space @xmath15 with @xmath16 ,",
    "we have constructed the _ primitive disk complex _ , denoted by @xmath21 , whose vertices are defined to be the isotopy classes of the _ primitive disks _ in the handlebody @xmath4 . in @xcite , the combinatorial structure of the complex @xmath21 are fully studied and it was shown that @xmath21 is simply connected , in fact contractible , under the condition @xmath17 , and is used to obtained the presentation of the goeritz group . in the case of @xmath18 , the complex @xmath21 is no longer simply connected .",

    "the action of the goeritz group on the tree of trees will be investigated to obtain the presentation of the group .",
    "right before section [ sec : main_section ] , the simplest example of our case @xmath18 , the lens space @xmath22 , will be studied in detail in section [ sec : first_example ] as a motivating example . in the final section ,",

    "<S> we study the remaining generic lens spaces , and show that the mapping class group of the genus-@xmath0 heegaard splitting is finitely presented for any lens space by giving its explicit presentation . as an application , we show that the fundamental groups of the spaces of the genus-@xmath0 heegaard splittings of lens spaces are all finitely presented . </S>"
