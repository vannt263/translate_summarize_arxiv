    "we have developed a programme of star counts on schmidt plates in a few directions of the galaxy .",
    "objectives of this programme are to trace the fine structure of our galaxy through the statistical study of the stellar distributions according to their luminosity , colors and proper motions .",
    "this involves two steps : first , acquiring a new photometric and astrometric sample survey in various galactic directions ; and second analysing the data using a model of population synthesis and determining the properties of populations in the galaxy and constraints on the scenario of formation and evolution . in the framework of this programme ,",
    "new observations were carried out in selected areas situated in the main meridional section and towards galactic antirotation direction in the galaxy .",
    "the combination of oca , eso , tautenburg and palomar schmidt plates is used to derive the photometry and the absolute proper motions of the stars on a time baseline of about 35 years .    in our earlier work ( ojha et al .",
    "1994ab ; robin et al .",
    "1996 ) , using the data from galactic anticentre and centre fields with wide - area surveys in other fields available to date , we discussed the radial and vertical structure of the galaxy . by comparing the star count ratio between the two data sets ( galactic anticentre and centre )",
    ", we obtained the scale length of thin disk ( h@xmath11@xmath122.5 kpc ) and thick disk populations ( h@xmath11@xmath123 kpc ) .",
    "the thick disk was found to have a scale height of 760@xmath1050 pc , with a local density of 5.6@xmath101 % of the thin disk .",
    "our results confirmed no radial and vertical gradients in thick disk kinematics .",
    "the thick disk formation scenario was discussed based on the new photometric and kinematic data .",
    "the present paper extends our previous work of a sample survey plan to produce probes of stellar populations in the milky way .",
    "the thick disk population is revisited under the light of new data .",
    "we have chosen a direction towards galactic anticentre at medium latitude ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ; @xmath2,@xmath3 ; hereafter gac2 ) and obtained bv star counts and absolute proper motion data in 7.13 square degrees for a complete sample of 6041 stars brighter than b = 20 mag .",
    "schmidt plates from tautenburg telescope were used to obtain magnitudes and color .",
    "deep ccd sequences from 104-cm telescope of uttar pradesh state observatory , nainital ( india ) and 120-cm telescope from observatoire de haute - provence ( france ) have been used to increase the magnitude limits up to v@xmath1218.5 and b@xmath1220 .",
    "the choice of this particular area was made partly because this field gives the counterpart of the galactic centre field ( ojha et al .",
    "1994b , hereafter gc , paper ii ) and serves as a complement to the field toward the outer part of the galaxy .",
    "the absolute proper motions of the stars in this field have been published elsewhere ( ojha et al .",
    "1994a , hereafter gac1 , paper i ) . using the two fields ( gac1,2 & gc ) together is a good choice for sighting the intermediate population as shown in our preliminary studies ( paper i & ii ; ojha et al . 1996",
    "( hereafter paper iii ) ; robin et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the other survey is based on the measurement of 14 palomar and eso schmidt plates covering an area of 20.84 square degrees centered on @xmath6,@xmath7 corresponding to @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "this field is close to the galactic antirotation direction ( hereafter gar ) at intermediate latitude .",
    "the catalogue contains about 22000 stars with completeness limits of v=18.5 , b=20 and u=18.5 .",
    "this field is a test direction to find evidence of the relative motions of the halo and intermediate populations .",
    "it also gives informations on the inclination of the velocity ellipsoids of these populations .",
    "these results will be published in future papers .",
    "a preliminary analysis of this catalogue together with a comparison with existing catalogues towards the same latitude ( @xmath13b@xmath13 ) and with besanon model of population synthesis is given elsewhere ( paper iii & robin et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the present paper",
    ", we discuss a new complete survey of absolute stellar proper motions and multicolor photometery .",
    "the more detailed analysis is also presented in the paper .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in  2 , we discuss briefly the photographic plates used in the present surveys . the photographic calibration is explained in  3 . in this section ,",
    "we give the new color equations for the eso and tautenburg schmidt plates .",
    " 4 describes the derivation of absolute proper motions and the overall accuracy of the proper motion surveys . in  5 , we present the variation of the stellar number density as a function of distance from the galactic plane .",
    "from this , we deduce the structural parameters of the thin and thick disk population . in  6 , we derive the kinematics of the thick disk component . ",
    "7 shows the comparison of our data sets with the besanon model of population synthesis .",
    "in the gac2 field , among the 14 schmidt plates used for the astrometric reduction described in paper i ( table 1 ) , we have chosen 2 tautenburg schmidt plates ( 2420 & 2430 ) in the v band ( kodak 103a - g+gg11 ) and 2 plates ( 6568 & 6569 ) in the b band ( astro - spezial+gg13 ) for photometric purposes .",
    "each plate covers an area of 3.@xmath143@xmath153.@xmath143 with a scale of 51.4 arcsec mm@xmath16 .",
    "all the plates were measured on the mama microdensitometer in paris with a pixel size of 10 @xmath17 .",
    "the treatment of the plate with mama has been extensively described by berger et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .    in the gar field ,",
    "14 schmidt plates from palomar and eso were used for the photometric and astrometric measurements .",
    "plate descriptions are given in table 1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the thick disk parameters derived from gar field are in good agreement with others : soubiran 1993ab ; beers & larsen 1994 ; bartasiute 1994 and paper iii ( derived from 2 intermediate latitude fields ) . by combining the four fields , gac1,2 , gc , gar and ngp ( soubiran 1993ab ) , we have derived the mean kinematical parameters of thick disk ( as shown in table 5 in paper iii ) , which are : @xmath18 = 67@xmath104 km / s , @xmath19 = 51@xmath103 km / s , @xmath20 = 40 km / s and v@xmath21 = -53@xmath1010 km / s ( with respect to the sun ) .",
    "we do not find any evidence for a vertical gradient in the thick disk kinematics in gar field , in agreement with our previous results in the anticentre and centre fields , and with the field near the pole ( soubiran 1993ab ) .",
    "the suggested gradient from majewski ( 1992 ) is not confirmed . as shown in table 6 in paper iii that since 5 - 6 years",
    ", the accuracy of the kinematical measurements of the thick disk population has greatly improved and the results are well in agreement with each others .",
    "the data have been compared to the besanon model ( robin & crz 1986 , 1996 ; bienaym et al .",
    "1987 ; haywood 1994 , 1997 ) , by simulating the distributions of magnitudes , colors and proper motions including the photometric and astrometric errors as determined .",
    "the besanon model of stellar population synthesis has been developed for about 13 years as an attempt to put together all constraints ( theoretical and observational ) about galactic evolution in order to obtain a consistent scenario of galaxy evolution .",
    "we used the new version of the model ( robin et al .",
    "1999 ) . to minimize the poisson noise in model simulations , the catalogues are simulated 5 or 10 times the total area of the observed data set .",
    "while the simulations in the two fields are qualitatively in agreement with the data , some discrepancies exist .",
    "in particular , the model overpredicts the number of stars in the gac2 field beyond v@xmath2217 ( fig .",
    "6 ) . in gar field ,",
    "the number of stars are also slightly overpredicted at the bright magnitudes ( v@xmath2312 ) ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "all together , the models seem to predict slightly more red disk stars than visible in the data ( b - v@xmath121.0 - 1.2 ) . the comparison between the model predictions and the observed magnitude",
    ", color and proper motion distributions in two galactic fields is shown in figs .",
    "6 , 7 & 8 .",
    "the distribution of the observed star counts in v band is shown in fig .",
    "6 . in the same diagram ,",
    "the model predicted counts are overplotted .",
    "the error bars are @xmath24 , where n is the number of stars in each bin .",
    "the two distributions are in good agreement in the magnitude range 11@xmath23v@xmath2317 , however , we find that the model predicts slightly more stars beyond v = 17 towards this direction .",
    "the possible reasons of this discrepancy between the model and data are discussed in  8 .    the comparison between the observed data set and the besanon model predictions in b - v color indice is also shown in fig .",
    "6 . there is a good agreement between the two distributions in the magnitude range 12@xmath25v@xmath2518 . at b - v @xmath12 1.2 ( in fig .",
    "6 ) , the more red disk stars are seen in the model compared to the data .",
    "7 shows the observed v distribution towards gar field .",
    "we compare these observations with the predictions of the besanon model overplotted on the same figure .",
    "the total observed counts are in good agreement with the model predictions in the magnitude range 12@xmath23v@xmath2318 , however , the contribution of blue stars at v@xmath2312 is slightly larger in the model .    the comparison between the observed distributions and the model predictions in b - v color indice is also shown in fig",
    "the two distributions in b - v color are in good agreement in the magnitude range 13@xmath23v@xmath2315 . in the magnitude range 15@xmath23v@xmath2318.5",
    ", the model overpredicts the red disk stars ( b - v @xmath221.0 ) .",
    "model predicted proper motions distributions are compared to the observed ones in fig .",
    "8 , assuming the same observational errors .",
    "the proper motion distributions ( in @xmath27 & @xmath28 ) agree well for stars in all the magnitude ranges .",
    "the mean velocity ellipsoid of the thick disk population used in the model simulation is the one deduced from our previous investigations in intermediate latitude fields and from the present paper . due to the stellar drift",
    ", the asymmetric shape of the distribution of latitude proper motion is clearly visible in data and model .",
    "proper motion distribution is sensitive to the asymmetric drift and the velocity dispersions of the stellar populations .",
    "the comparison between the data and model distributions in fig .",
    "8 is quite well , particularly at 15@xmath23v@xmath2317 , where the majority of thick disk stars exist .",
    "it also proves that our value of the thick disk velocity ellipsoid is well determined .",
    "we have matched our data sets against the besanon model of population synthesis .",
    "the main aim of these comparisons is to check the coherence of the model .",
    "although , the total number counts brighter than v=18.5 are in relatively good agreement with observations , the contribution of blue stars of disk ( v@xmath2312 ) is slightly larger in the model in gar direction .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy is difficult to trace back with the present data .",
    "it could be attributed to two different parameters in the model , or a mixed of these two : the hr diagram ( e.g the relative distribution of disk stars in the hr diagram ) or the normalisation adopted for the disk stars , the 2nd parameters being the most critical .",
    "since there is almost no data available to constraint the model between magnitudes 9 - 12 , the model is almost entirely defined by its fit to the solar neighborhood luminosity function ( see haywood 1994 , haywood et al .",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) adopted to normalize the model was that published by wielen et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , and it is known to overestimate the number of stars in the 25 pc sphere by almost 30% ( turon , 1996 ) .",
    "this problem could also be attributed to the distribution of the disk stars in the hr diagram , in particular , since the b - v color at bright magnitudes ( v=9 - 12 ) are uncorrectly shifted to the red .",
    "however , simulations made with different sfr for disk stars , changing the relative distribution in the hr diagram , did not improve significantly the b - v model - data comparisons .",
    "one expects that these two aspects will be much better known now after the analysis of the hipparcos and tycho catalogues , which provides strong contraints on the distribution of the stars at v@xmath2310.5 .",
    "besanon model is in further improvement phase by using the data from hipparcos and tycho catalogues .    at fainter apparent magnitudes , where the disk becomes less important ( v@xmath2212 ) , the predictions are in good agreement in b - v ( figs . 6 & 7 ) . at v@xmath2212 ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of the dominant stars is not the same that at v@xmath2312 .",
    "however , at v=16 - 18 , there are again slightly more stars in the model than in the data , in the two fields at b - v @xmath12 1.2 .",
    "this can not be attributed to incompletness in the data , since the catalogues are completed up to v=18.5 and b=20 .",
    "according to galactic models , red stars ( b - v@xmath221 ) at these magnitudes ( v@xmath2217 ) are disk stars , whereas at b - v@xmath91.2 and 16@xmath23v@xmath2317 , there is a number of thick disk stars which could eventually make the overprediction of the model .",
    "this discrepancy could be due the luminosity function of the thick disk which may be inappropriate , if this is not the density law .",
    "if the present discrepancy is significant , one could possibly be attributed to unresolved binaries also , which are not accounted for in the model .",
    "we have presented a new survey of absolute stellar proper motions and multicolor photometry to v = 18.5 in two directions at intermediate latitude .",
    "the most probable value of scale height for the thick disk stars in gar direction is determined to be h@xmath29@xmath30790@xmath1010 pc with a local density of 6.1@xmath103 % relative to the thin disk .",
    "the velocity ellipsoid of the thick disk component has been determined .",
    "these values are in perfect agreement with the recent determination given by robin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and ojha et al .",
    "( 1996 ) based on the analysis of a large set of available photometric and astrometric catalogues .",
    "the besanon model predictions are also compared with the present survey in the overlapping magnitude ranges .",
