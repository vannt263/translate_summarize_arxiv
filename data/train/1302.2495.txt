    "we studied this transition using a model @xcite of the rippled disks which are structures that have been experimentally observed as precursors of the transition to ribbons . minimizing the energy of the model shape we found that the size of the ripples remains very small when the line tension is high ( i.e. , in the flat disk phase ) while the size in the radial direction abruptly becomes large in a narrow range of @xmath9 when @xmath9 is lowered .",

    "we studied this phenomenon by considering a ribbon - like perturbation added to a protrusion created at the edge of a flat membrane by the optical trap .",
    "our analysis of this instability was restricted to a free energy model which ignores the director field .",
    "assuming that the mean curvature modulus @xmath1 is nonzero we found that the ribbon - like perturbation is energetically favorable once the protrusion reaches a nonzero critical size @xmath138 .",
    "this result agrees qualitatively with experiment , however , our value of the critical stretching is an order of magnitude less than that observed experimentally , possibly due to our neglect of the director field .    for both instabilities",
    "we have found that the mean curvature energy acts as a barrier to the creation of twisted ribbons . in the case of the rippled disk we found that if @xmath93 , the membrane remains flat and ripples are not energetically favorable . in the case of stretching",
