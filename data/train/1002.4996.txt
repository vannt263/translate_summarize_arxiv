    "in the nature , molecules tend to interact to form more complicated structures of crystals and supramolecules .",
    "the spontaneous construction of particular molecular structures is one important topic in dna and molecular computing , which is based on the watson - crick complementarity between pairs of dna strands .",
    "generally , the process is composed of two steps .",
    "first , the basic building blocks are carefully designed and constructed by synthetic chemistry ; and then the aimed large structure is assembled by sticking basic blocks together through watson - crick complementarity . in 1996 , winfree  @xcite showed how the formation of large structures from certain dna molecules can simulate the blocked cellular automata ( bca ) , which is of the same computational power to the turing machines . in 1998 , winfree , liu , wenzler , and seeman   designed and produced two - dimensional dna crystals in their laboratory by the method of self - assembly .",
    "one systematic study on this topic is the self - assembly of squares . in 1999 , adleman  @xcite proposed models of self - assembly , which are based on the theory of wang tiles  @xcite , and studied the time complexity of linear polymerization via `` step counting '' . in 2000 , rothemund and winfree   showed that to deterministically self - assemble an @xmath4 full square , @xmath5 tiles is required for temperature @xmath6 and the number of tiles for the case of fixed temperature @xmath7 is @xmath8 . in 2001 ,",
    "adleman , cheng , goel , and huang   showed that @xmath9 tiles is enough for fixed temperature @xmath10 . in 2006 , kao and schweller   showed that if the temperature @xmath11 is allowed to change systematically , then a constant number of tiles is enough for the self - assembly of arbitrary @xmath4 full square with temperature sequence of length @xmath12 .",
    "one variation on the self - assembly of squares is that we study tile of shapes other than squares that can tile a full two - dimensional plane ; and instead of considering full squares , we discuss the self - assembly of other particular full two - dimensional region . for tiling a full two - dimensional plane with one single shape of regular polygons , the only possible choice of regular polygons are equilateral triangles , squares , and hexagons .",
    "in this paper , we discuss the self - assembly of triangles and other shapes by triangular tiles , more specifically , of shape of equilateral triangles and of right triangles , respectively .    in section  2 , we will introduce the definition of triangular tile assembly system . in section  3",
    ", we discuss the computational power of the triangular tile assembly system , and show that it is turing universal . in section  4 , we compare the square tile assembly system and triangular tile assembly system in the aspect of shape complexity and show that the two types of system are not comparable . in section  5 , we discuss the assembly of triangles . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize the obtained results .",
    "all discussion in this paper is on a two - dimensional plane .",
    "before we discuss the right triangular tiles and the equilateral triangular tiles respectively , we first give a uniform definition of the _ tile assembly model _",
    "( tam ) .",
    "similar to the square tiles , we define a _ triangular tile _ to be an triangle of particular shape ( right triangle or equilateral triangle ) with each side being colored from the set @xmath13 of `` glues '' . without loss of generality , we assume that the shortest side of a triangular tile is of unit length .",
    "we also assume that a triangular tile can not be rotated nor flipped over . both square tiles and triangular tiles are called tiles .",
    "the particular non - interactive glue is denoted by @xmath14 and we always assume @xmath15 . the _ temperature _ @xmath11 is a real number , which presents under which the assembly is proceeded , and the set of all valid temperature is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "a _ strength function _",
    "@xmath17 is defined such that @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in particular , we are interested in the discrete case @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 if @xmath23 otherwise @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are non - negative integers .",
    "we say two tiles can _ stick _ together if they can be physically put adjacent by the sides @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the same length such that @xmath28 .",
    "a tile can stick to a set of tiles if they can be physically put adjacent by the sides @xmath29 and @xmath30 of the same length such that @xmath31 .",
    "a _ super - tile _ is a set of tiles that stick to each other such that no two tiles overlap and for any two tiles there is a path of sticked edges between them .",
    "we also call a single tile super - tile .    a _ tile assembly system _",
    "is a tuple @xmath32 , where @xmath1 is a finite set of tiles , @xmath33 is a particular super - tile called _ seed _ , @xmath34 is a strength function , and @xmath11 is the temperature .",
    "the produce of a tile assembly system is a super - tile @xmath35 such that there is a super - tile sequence @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is obtained by stick one tile in @xmath1 to @xmath38 under temperature @xmath11 and no tile in @xmath1 can be stick to @xmath39 to obtain a bigger super - tile .",
    "a tile assembly system is _ deterministic _ if its produce is unique regardless of the different choice of super - tile at each step .    in analogy to the self - assembly of full square ,",
    "in what follows we will study the self - assembly of full triangles and other full shapes by right triangular tiles and equilateral triangular tiles , respectively . here",
    "`` full '' means the pair of common edges of every two adjacent tiles in the produce has a positive strength .",
    "_ right triangular tiles _ are triangular tiles of the shape of right triangles with the right angle point to four possible directions as illustrated in figure  [ fig : ttile ] .",
    "more formally , a right triangular tile is described by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are glues on sides of the tile in the counter - clockwise order starting from the longest side and @xmath42 presents the direction of the right angle . _ equilateral triangular tiles _ are triangular tiles of the shape of equilateral triangles that are either in an upward position or in a downward position as illustrated in figure  [ fig : ttile ] .",
    "more formally , it is described by @xmath40 , where @xmath43 presents the two positions and @xmath41 are glues on sides of the tile in the counter - clockwise order starting from the horizontal side .",
