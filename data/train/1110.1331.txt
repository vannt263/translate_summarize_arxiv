    "important issues , such as the impact of the phase transition on the compressibility of the material@xcite as well as on the electrical conductivity@xcite are still subjects of an intense discussion .",
    "the core problem of obtaining a complete understanding of these phenomena and properties on the most fundamental level of physics arises from the difficulty of simulating the paramagnetic high - temperature phase from first principles . in this work",
    "we first discuss the methodologies that have been used in theoretical treatments of paramagnetism",
    ". then we present a practical scheme for calculating thermodynamic properties , in particular the equation of state , of a paramagnetic material at elevated temperature merging _",
    "ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( md ) and the disordered local moments model ( dlm ) .",
    "this dlm - md technique is then applied to investigate the influence of temperature and pressure on the compressibility of crn .",
    "we show that the change of the bulk modulus of crn upon the pressure induced phase transition is minimal , strengthening conclusions from earlier static calculations  @xcite which questioned its reported collapse  @xcite .",
    "a theory that describes the finite - temperature aspects of itinerant electron magnets has to take into account the existence of local magnetic moments present above the magnetic transition temperature , the curie temperature @xmath0 or the nel temperature @xmath1 for a ferromagnetic or an antiferromagnetic material respectively  @xcite . at the same time , the majority of methods used for _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations nowadays are based on the density functional theory ( dft ) in the local ( local spin density , lsda ) or semi - local ( generalized gradient , gga ) approximations . while they are known to give an accurate description of the ground state properties of magnetic systems  @xcite , its straightforward generalization to finite temperatures leads to quantitative , as well as qualitative errors  @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 of transition metals are overestimated by a factor of five and there are no moments and no curie - weiss law above @xmath0 .",
    "a solution to this problem should in principle be sought in the physics of strongly correlated electron systems . in particular ,",
    "the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite , combined with lda band structure calculations has been used with success for simulations of finite - temperature magnetism in fe and ni  @xcite . however , its application to the study of structural phase transition in fe  @xcite had to neglect a contribution from the lattice dynamics , because of prohibitively high computational cost and difficulties in calculating forces between atoms  @xcite .    at the same time , it is realized that lsda calculations at zero temperature can provide valuable information for the description of the finite temperature magnetism .",
    "one way of doing this is to extract magnetic interactions in the form of exchange constants for a classical heisenberg model  @xcite or magnetic `` forces '' ( the first variation of the total energy for a differential rotation of a local moment )  @xcite from dft calculations and to use them in statistical mechanics  @xcite or in spin - dynamics  @xcite simulations of magnetic properties at elevated temperatures .",
    "another useful approach is given by the so - called disordered local moment model , introduced by hubbard  @xcite and hasegawa  @xcite , and combined with the lsda - dft by gyorffy _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . within the dlm picture ,",
    "the local magnetic moments exist in the paramagnetic state above the magnetic transition temperature , but are fully disordered .",
    "the magnetically disordered state can be described as a pseudo - alloy of equal amounts of atoms with spin up and spin down orientations of their magnetic moments , and its electronic structure and the total energy can be calculated within the conventional alloy theory using the coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite or the supercell technique  @xcite .",
    "the methodology is highly successful in applications to many materials systems , ranging from steels  @xcite to actinides  @xcite , and its generalization for the case of partial magnetic disorder can be used in simulations of structural phase transitions in a vicinity of magnetic @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "still , to the best of our knowledge all the applications of the dlm model so far neglected the effect of lattice vibrations .",
    "on the other hand , the importance of lattice dynamics for an accurate description of thermodynamic properties of materials is well recognized by now  @xcite . in particular , its consideration can be essential for a treatment of lattice stabilities  @xcite , heat capacities  @xcite , and equations of state  @xcite of solids .",
    "the importance of lattice vibrations should be fully recognized in the paramagnetic state of magnetic materials , as it occurs only at elevated temperatures .",
    "however , simultaneous treatment of the magnetic disorder , inherent to the paramagnetic state , and lattice vibrations represent a truly challenging task .",
    "state - of - the art treatments of lattice vibrations are based either on ( quasi- ) harmonic calculations of the phonon dispersion relations or on molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite . for magnetically ordered materials",
    "these techniques can be applied straightforwardly . however , in the presence of magnetic excitations this will not work . in particular , in the paramagnetic state at high temperatures the relevant magnetic excitations are associated with spin - flips .",
    "their characteristic time scale can be estimated by the spin decoherence time @xmath2 .",
    "spin - dynamics simulations of the spin autocorrelation function in bcc fe above @xmath0  @xcite show that @xmath2 is of the order of 20 - 50 fs . in materials with lower",
    "@xmath0 it should be larger by approximately a corresponding factor , because both @xmath0 and the velocity of the propagation of the local moments are related to the strength of the exchange interactions . at the same time a typical md run should be carried out for at least 3 - 5 ps , as dictated by the inverse of the debye frequency ( @xmath3 s ) .",
    "this means that magnetic configurations should change often during the md run .",
    "simultaneously , a typical md time step is of order of 1 fs , which is still much smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the magnetic degree of freedom is slow on the time scale relevant for the determination of temporal evolution of a particular atomic configuration , but fast on the time scale relevant for a proper exploration of the phase space of atomic configurations .",
    "therefore , the adiabatic decoupling between magnetic and vibrational degrees of freedom can not be applied , and they should be treated within one single framework .",
    "similar arguments can be used to question a validity of lattice dynamics studies for paramagnetic materials based on quasi - harmonic approximation .",
    "perhaps the most consistent approach to the analysis of spin - lattice interactions at finite temperature would be to apply a combination of molecular dynamics with _ ab initio _ spin dynamics  @xcite or with dmft .",
    "however , at present such calculations are hardly feasible in practice .    within our approach",
    "we describe the paramagnetic state of a system within the disordered local moment picture . in this approach ,",
    "local moments exist at each magnetic site of a system ( in our case , at cr sites in crn ) and are commonly thought to fluctuate fairly independently .",
    "thoughtful discussions of the dlm model can be found in ref.s .",
    "the status of the dlm approach in the many - body lattice models like the hubbard or s - f exchange `` kondo lattice '' model is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is argued that though in a complete theory the charge and spin fields are dynamically fluctuating both in space and time , a `` static '' dlm approximation , where one neglects the dynamics of the fluctuations captures an important part of the correlations . in the dlm a correlated system is described in terms of a pseudo - alloy of spin up and spin down components .",
    "combined with the coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite it becomes equivalent to the `` hubbard iii '' approximation  @xcite for the original many - body problem , and it is used with success in many applications .",
    "however , the cpa is applicable for the description of a substitutionally disordered system with atoms at the sites of an ideal underlying crystal lattice  @xcite , and therefore can not be used for treatment of lattice dynamics at finite temperatures . in a previous work@xcite",
    ", we took one step towards the simultaneous modeling of magnetic and vibrational finite temperature effects by suggesting two alternative supercell implementations of the dlm calculations . in the first , a specific collinear distributions of up and down magnetic moments arranged to minimize the spin correlation functions",
    "were used , in line with the special quasirandom structure ( sqs)@xcite methodology . in the second , a magnetic sampling method ( msm ) was proposed . in the msm ,",
    "the energies of a number of randomly generated magnetic distributions were calculated and their running average was taken as the potential energy of the paramagnetic sample . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that for crn msm calculations are converged already for 40 different magnetic distributions , and the two approaches , the sqs and msm give almost identical results .",
    "the sqs approach makes use of the fact that in a static picture with all atoms fixed on ideal lattice points , the description of a spatial disorder between the local moment orientations is a good approximation to model the energetics of the combined space and time fluctuations of magnetic moments in a real paramagnet .",
    "unfortunately , if the vibrations of atoms are to be included , one needs to go beyond the fixed magnetic state described by the sqs .",
    "the reason is that if a magnetic state is fixed in time one would see artificial static displacements of atoms off their lattice sites due to forces between the atoms with different orientations of their local moments and with different local magnetic environments . in the crn case",
    "those are likely to be quite large due to the magnetic stress discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a real paramagnet , due to the time fluctuations of the local moments",
    ", this effects should be at least partially averaged out and suppressed depending on the time scales of the spin fluctuations and atomic motions .",
    "the msm could in principle be used to obtain the adiabatic approximation where the magnetic fluctuations are considered to be instantaneous on the time scales of atomic motions .",
    "this approximation would be obtained if the forces acting on each atom were averaged over a sufficient number of different magnetic samples during each time step of a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "the obvious drawback in this approach is that a large number of calculations needs to be run in parallel leading to an increase , a factor 40 in our case , in computational demands .",
    "furthermore , as stated above it is not at all clear that this adiabatic approximation is motivated in any system .",
    "however , the msm gives us a very good starting point for the implementation of the dlm picture in a md framework .      in this work",
    "we introduce a method for molecular dynamics simulations of paramagnetic materials within the traditional _ ab - initio _ md framework . starting from the dlm idea of a spatial disorder of local moments , we also change the magnetic state periodically and in a stochastic manner during our md simulation . in this way we deal with a magnetic state that does not show order either on the length scales of our supercell , or time scale of our simulation .",
    "we make an approximation that the magnetic state of the system is completely randomly rearranged with a time step given by a spin flip time ( @xmath4 ) , and with a constraint that the net magnetization of the system should be zero .",
    "hence to simulate a paramagnetic system with a spin flip time @xmath4 , we initialize our calculations by setting up a supercell where collinear local moments are randomly oriented and the total moment of the supercell is zero , and run collinear spin - polarized md for the number of md time steps ( @xmath5 ) corresponding to the spin flip time , that is for @xmath6 time steps .",
    "thereafter the spin state is randomized again , while the lattice positions and velocities are unchanged , and the simulation run continues .",
    "here it is worth to point out that besides the treatment of the many - body effects important for the description of the paramagnetic state at the dlm - lsda level , or as will be discussed below for the present case : dlm - lsda+u , we introduce several additional approximations . in particular , we neglect effects due to non - collinear orientations of the local magnetic moments .",
    "this , however , is justified for the paramagnetic state well above the magnetic transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "note also that magnitudes of the local magnetic moments are allowed to vary as dictated by the self - consistent solution of the electronic structure problem at each step of md simulation . at the same time",
    ", we substitute the true spin dynamics with instantaneous modification of the sample magnetic structure with time steps @xmath4 . here",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and make use of the physical picture that the simulated system , although ergodic , does not cover its phase space uniformly in time . in the dlm model",
    "one assumes that it gets stuck for long times , of the order of @xmath4 , near points characterized by a finite moment at every site pointing in more or less random directions and then moves rapidly ( in our case instantly ) to another similar point .",
    "the states of temporarily broken ergodicity are characterized by classical unit vectors , @xmath7 , assigned to each site i and giving the direction of the magnetization averaged over the spatial extent of the i - th site in the supercell and the time @xmath4 .",
    "the motion of temporarily broken ergodicity is mainly characterized by changes in the orientational configuration of the moments .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the magnetic degree of freedom was related to an inverse spin - wave frequency @xmath8 100 fs , which represents the dominating magnetic excitation at low temperatures . however , in the paramagnetic state at high temperatures the relevant magnetic excitations are associated with spin - flips rather than with spin waves . thus the relevant time scale is better characterized by the spin decoherence time @xmath9 rather than by the inverse spin - wave frequency . as we pointed out above ,",
    "the latter was estimated to be of the order 20 - 50 fs in bcc fe above @xmath0  @xcite . for crn , with a @xmath1 around room temperature and probably with weaker exchange interactions",
    ", we expect that @xmath2 could be somewhat larger",
    ".    however , our procedure makes it possible to model a paramagnetic system for any particular time scale of the spin dynamics .",
    "in fact one can span the whole range between the two adiabatic approximations : from the frozen magnetic structure to magnetic configurations that rearrange instantaneously on the time scales of each atomic motion during the md run .",
    "of course , the appropriate value of this parameter needs to be found with real spin dynamics calculations or taken from experiments . in this paper",
    ", we study a range of different spin flip times and their consequences for the obtained structural and thermodynamic properties of crn .",
    "all our first - principles calculations in this work is performed using the projector augmented wave method  @xcite as implemented in the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite .",
    "the electronic exchange - correlation effects are modeled using a combination of the local density approximation with a hubbard coloumb term ( lda+u )  @xcite using the double - counting correction scheme suggested by dudarev _",
    "et al . _",
    "the value of the effective @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) applied only to the cr @xmath12-orbitals is taken as 3 ev , found to be suitable in comparison with several experimentally measured structural and electronic properties in ref .",
    "@xcite .    our simulation box , both in the simulation of the cubic and orthorhombic phases , contains 32 cr and 32 n atoms arranged in a supercell of 2x2x2 conventional cubic unit cells . in the orthorhombic case ,",
    "the primitive vectors of the supercell are tilted and scaled in line with the results of a structural optimization of this low temperature antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "the plane wave energy cut - off was set to 400 ev .",
    "we used a monkhorst - pack scheme  @xcite for sampling of the brillouin zone using a grid of 2x2x2 k - points . to check the accuracy of the potential energies and pressures a selection of configurations",
    "are chosen out of the md simulation run and recalculated with a higher accuracy .",
    "the error arising from for the k - point sampling is relatively constant with a shift of about 35 mev and a standard deviation of less then 2 mev .",
    "hence the relative potential energies that are calculated have a high accuracy .",
    "the pressures also have a small constant shift of about 0.2 gpa with a standard deviation less then 0.1 gpa when the electronic structure calculations are converged with respect to the k - point mesh .    in order to control the temperature of the simulation ,",
    "avoid artificial energy drift and to minimize the influence of the particular choice of initial magnetic and lattice configurations in the simulations we use a nose thermostat@xcite .",
    "the values of the bulk modulus , @xmath13 , have been determined by fitting our calculated pressure and volume data to the birch - murnaghan equation of state@xcite .",

    "this can be compared with the total energy reduction due to static relaxations of 15 mev that we get by using the sqs approach treating the magnetic state as frozen in time .",
    "we note that for the lower values of @xmath4 , corresponding to fast spin decoherence , there is a plateau were the potential energy is only weakly influenced by @xmath4 . however , between spin flip times of 15 to 50 fs , there is a considerable change in potential energy . of course",

    "hence we can see the effect of the magnetic state on the distribution of pair distances . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairdist]a the @xmath4 is very short , 10 fs , hence the atoms do not have time to adjust their positions for the current orientation of local magnetic moments and we do not see any difference in distances between the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 pairs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairdist]b , the spin flip time is increased to 100 fs and now the atoms have had sufficient time to move towards the energetically preferential positions .",
    "consequently , a shift in pair distances between @xmath22 and the @xmath23 is evident .",
    "[ fig : pairdist]c is obtained with the same orientation of local moments during the whole md run .",
    "here we also see a splitting in the pair distances between the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 pairs , which is of the same order as in the previous case .",
    "hence , 100 fs between the re - arrangement of magnetic configurations is long enough for the atomic nuclei to adjust considerably their positions in the supercell to the given magnetic configuration . in the last figure , fig .",
    "[ fig : pairdist]d , the pair distances are shown for the low temperature antiferromagnetic orthorhombic ground state for comparison . here the @xmath22 and @xmath23 pairs of magnetic moments are arranged in an ordered way , see e.g. fig . 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite , that allows for maximal relaxation of atomic coordinates in combination with a structural relaxation of the unit cell , giving rise to a large separation between the two different kinds of pairs .",
    "a possibility of statistical correlations between the atomic distances and the orientation of atomic moments also in a dynamically changing paramagnetic phase is indeed an intriguing thought experiment .",
    "although we can not rule out its existence from principal considerations , to the best of our knowledge it has never been reported in experiments .",
    "however , we note that our two main approximations in the present dlm - md , the usage of collinear moments and the temporarily broken ergodicity of the dlm approach , are likely to introduce inaccuracies that exaggerate those local spin - lattice correlations when a slow spin dynamics is modelled .",
    "therefore , when the here suggested method is used , a smaller value of @xmath4 , corresponding to the absence of differences in distances between atoms with parallel and antiparallel local moments , like in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairdist]a , should be recommended .",
    "the presence of an energy plateau in fig .",
    "[ fig : eshift ] seems to indicate that this should be a reasonable approach .",
    "our main goal with this work is to study the equation of states , and in particular the bulk modulus of paramagnetic crn which has recently been discussed in the literature  @xcite . using our dlm - md approach we are able to calculate volume as a function of temperature and pressure for both the paramagnetic cubic and the antiferromagnetic orthorhombic phases . in the former case",
    "we also investigate if there is an impact of the value of the spin flip time parameter on the equation of state .",
    "thus we are able to investigate how both the dynamical change of magnetic configurations in the paramagnetic state and the lattice vibrations , neglected in previous theoretical works but of course present in the experiments , impact on the compressibility .",
    "figure  [ fig : eos ] shows the calculated volume as a function of pressure for the two phases at 300 k and compare them to the experimental measurements by rivadulla  _ et al . _",
    "one sees very good agreement between theoretical and experimental equations of state .",
    "in particular the relative shift in volumes between the two phases is reproduced within the measured error bars .",
    "the calculated slope of the orthorhombic phase agrees well with the measured values for this phase where the measurement is done over a large pressure range .",

    "[ fig : eos ] shows the influence of the spin flip time on the volume versus pressure curves in paramagnetic cubic crn .",
    "a change in @xmath4 introduces a small shift of the volumes , but does not influence the slope of the curves .",
    "our results confirm the possibility of a pressure induced phase transition from the cubic paramagnetic to the orthorhombic antiferromagnetic phase due to the slightly smaller volume of the latter , in line with previous investigations .",
    "importantly , as can be seen in table [ tbl : k0 ] and from the slopes of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] , the bulk modulus is found to be very similar between the two phases .",
    "this is the case both at 300 k , 1000 k , and in the static 0 k calculations .",
