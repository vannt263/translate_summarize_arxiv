    "the x - ray pulsar xmmu j054134.7@xmath0682550 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) was discovered as a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) in an xmm - newton survey of the lmc ( shtykovskiy & gilfanov 2005 ) .",
    "the source was then listed as an hmxb in a catalog of hmxbs in the magellanic clouds ( liu , van paradijs & van den heuvel 2005 ) .    from a routine scanning of swift - bat data on 3 august 2007 ,",
    "xmmu j054134.7@xmath0682550 was found to be in outburst with an increase in flux levels from @xmath1 mcrab to @xmath2 mcrab ( palmer , grupe & krimm 2007 ) .",
    "spectral features , the transient nature , and pulsations at 61.6s detected in rxte observations during the outburst were considered to be an indication of the high mass x - ray binary nature of the source ( markwardt , swank & corbet 2007 ) .",
    "these authors also noted cyclotron absorption features at @xmath3 and @xmath4kev in the x - ray spectrum of the source .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the x - ray timing and spectral properties of the recent outburst of xmmu  j054134.7@xmath0682550 from 9 august 2007 through 1 november 2007 ( mjd 54321  mjd 54405 ) . during this period the 320kev flux declined from @xmath5ergs@xmath6@xmath7 to @xmath8 ergs@xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "we track the changes in spin period of the source , relating these to changes in the accretion geometry , and search for signatures of binarity in the lightcurve .",
    "we also study the evolution and flux dependence of the pulsed fraction through the outburst .",
    "furthermore , we explore the spectral evolution of the source over the outburst and with neutron star spin phase and investigate the possibility of cyclotron features in the spectrum .",
    "the proportional counter array ( pca , jahoda et al . 2006 ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) consists of five identical proportional counters coaligned to the same point in the sky , with a total geometric area of approximately 6250@xmath9 , a field of view to 1 square degree , and operating in the 260kev energy range . in may 2000 and in december 2006",
    ", pcu0 and pcu1 , respectively , lost their propane veto layers . without a propane veto layer ,",
    "these pcus have higher background levels .",
    "we have excluded the data from these pcus in our spectral analysis . to obtain better energy channel counting statistics",
    ", we used only the data obtained from the top pcu layers for the spectral analysis .",
    "for both spectral and timing analysis , the latest combined background models were used together with heasoft 6.3 to estimate the appropriate background .",
    "the long - term rxte - asm lightcurve of the source is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : asm ] .",
    "rxte observed xmmu  j054134.7@xmath0682550 through a type ii outburst and 28 observations were undertaken between 9 august 2007 and 1 november 2007 with a total exposure of @xmath10ks ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "a 325kev background subtracted rxte pca lightcurve of the source is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] . although the number of active pcus varied between one and three during the observations , count rates in fig .",

    "the mjd column refers to the start of the observation .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > \" , ]     [ tab : phaseres ]    the lower panel of figure  [ fig : phaseres ] shows the variation in the width of the iron line for the four phases of our pulse profile for the high energy cutoff model with y - error bars the 90% uncertainties from xspec .",
    "it is also clear from table  [ tab : phaseres ] that the iron line intensity follows the intensity of the source through the pulse profile , i.e. the iron line is strongest in the pulse peak . in shoulder 1 the iron line",
    "is poorly constrained , and the low @xmath11 , together with the errors on the line width indicate that it is not strictly required in this phase .",
    "the errors are large due to the faintness of both the iron line and are probably influenced by uncertainty in the underlying continuum .",
    "this makes it difficult to infer clearly any variation of the width of the line with phase from these data .",
    "neither of the models fitted point strongly towards the presence of a cyclotron feature in this source , however , given the quality of the data , a cyclotron line can not be ruled out .",
    "the data suggest that there may be some variation in both the width and intensity of the 6.4kev iron line through neutron star spin phase , but further observations below 3kev , which will constrain the hydrogen column density , are required to show any such variation with certainty .",
    "the lack of orbital signature in pulse frequency and phase residuals is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : frequency ] .",
    "we also searched for a possible periodicity in the rxte - asm lightcurve as a sign of the binary orbit , but we did not find a sign of orbital modulation .",
    "the lack of orbital signature may be due to the fact that the orbital period of the binary sytem is larger than the total observation time span of @xmath12 days .",
    "future x - ray monitoring observations are needed to detect the signs of the orbit of this system .",
    "the transient nature of the source may be a sign of a be type companion , i.e. the enhancement in the accretion rate may be due to the presence of a temporary accretion disk that forms when the neutron star enters denser equatorial stellar wind of the be companion .",
    "thus , the outburst is probably a type ii outburst from a be star system . from fig .",
    "[ fig : asm ] , this outburst is seen to be the brightest outburst from this source since the launch of rxte .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : frequency ] , a spin - up of trend of the source is evident especially for the first @xmath13 days of the observations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fderiv ] , it is seen that flux is correlated with spin - up rate of the source . from fig ,",
    "[ fig : fderiv ] , it is evident that observations corresponding to the lowest flux values have spin rates consistent with zero , showing that source is either spinning - up or it is at an almost constant spin frequency phase without any clear evidence of a spin - down episode . if we assume that observed x - ray luminosity is proportional to the bolometric luminosity ( or mass accretion rate ) , then spin - up rate ( which is proportional to torque exerted on the neutron star ) and x - ray flux correlation can be explained by accretion from accretion discs when the net torque is positive and of the order of the material torque ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ; ghosh 1993 ) .",
    "there are transient x - ray pulsar systems which show correlation between spin - up rate and x - ray flux : exo  2030 + 375 ( parmar , white & stella 1989 ; wilson et al .",
    "2002 ) , a  0535 + 26 ( finger , wilson & harmon 1996a ; bildsten et al .",

    "1999 ) , gro  j1744@xmath028 ( bildsten et al . 1997 ) , gro  j1750@xmath027 ( scott et al . 1997 ) , xte  j1543 + 568 ( int zand , corbet & marshall 2001 ) and sax  j2103.5 + 4545 ( baykal , stark & swank 2002 , baykal et al .",
    "2007 ) , 2s  1417@xmath062 ( finger et al .",
    "1996b , inam et al . 2004 ) .",
    "thus , the positive correlation we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fderiv ] may be an indication of accretion via an accretion disk .",
    "however , without any orbital correction , it is not possible to analyze the nature of this correlation quantitatively , since the calculated pulse frequencies might not accurately correspond to the pulsar s spin frequencies .    decreasing pulsed fraction with decreasing x - ray flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pfrac ] ) and changing pulse morphology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ) may indicate changes in accretion geometry and even be an indicator of a transition from disc to wind accretion , or an ongoing transition from accretor phase to propeller phase .",
    "this is similar to the decrease in pulsed fraction and pulse morphology changes in the low x - ray flux observations in 2s  1417@xmath062 ( inam et al .",
    "the evidence that observations corresponding to the lowest flux values have spin rates consistent with zero ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fderiv ] ) may also be an indicator of accretion geometry changes in the source .",
    "the decline of the x - ray flux together with the change in pulse profile shapes and pulsed fraction may be an indication of a transition from accretor to propeller stage .",
    "when the propeller stage sets in , the great majority of accreting matter can not reach the neutron star . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we can compare the factor of decrease in the bolometric luminosity with the theoretical expectation for accretion to propeller stage ,      where @xmath15 is the mass of the neutron star in units of @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the radius of the neutron star in units of @xmath18 cm and @xmath19 is the spin period of the neutron star in units of seconds ( corbet 1996 ; campana & stella 2000 ; campana et al .",
    "the factor @xmath20 becomes @xmath21 for a neutron star with mass @xmath22 , radius @xmath23 cm and spin period of @xmath24s .",
    "if we assume that the factor of decrease in bolometric luminosity is comparable to that of 320kev luminosity , we find that our observed factor of luminosity change is @xmath2 , which is much less than the theoretical expectation for a transition to propeller stage .",
    "it is not likely that we observe any transition to propeller stage .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] , pulse profiles show high variability .",
    "except 38 , 813 and 1318kev pulse profiles of the observation on mjd 54321.1 and 1825kev pulse profile of the observation on mjd 54351.6 , pulse profiles have two peaks seperated by @xmath25 phase .",
    "we found that both the phase average spectrum could be fit with either a cutoffpl model , with a possible weak cyclotron feature at 10kev , or that it could be fit adequately using a power law with high energy cut - off model without the need for a cyclotron feature .",
    "we used the power law model with high energy cutoff to map the spectral evolution throughout all observations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : specev ] ) .",
    "we also constructed pulse phase resolved spectra from the brightest observation .",
    "from this analysis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phaseres ] ) , we did not find any conclusive evidence of a cyclotron absorption feature , possibly due to low count statistics of the source .",
    "we found a very marignal variation in the iron line width and intensity which will need to be confirmed through further observations in the soft x - ray band .",
