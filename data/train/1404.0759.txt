    "the observation of the violation of gottfried sum rule @xcite from the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiment @xcite , the surprisingly large asymmetry between the up ( u ) and down ( d ) antiquark distributions in the proton measured from the drell - yan pair production @xcite and the semi - inclusive @xcite processes revealed a new light on the origins of the nucleon sea . while we still have not an adequate theory for the flavor asymmetry of sea quarks , the flavor asymmetric sea as a new recognized partonic component should be extracted from the experimental data in order to gain deeper and more precise insights of the nucleon structure . although the sea quark distributions of several widely used parton distribution functions ( pdf ) @xcite of the proton are updated using the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equation @xcite to the experimental measurements , the symmetric and asymmetric sea quark components have not been completely separated yet .",

    "the difficulty is that the asymmetric sea always mixes with the symmetric sea since the gluons are already produced at the scale @xmath2 .",
    "the flavor asymmetric sea is created by the nonperturbative qcd process since the perturbative processes can not cause a significant difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "one novel way to separate the asymmetric sea from the symmetric sea is to perform the qcd evolution starting from an low enough resolution scale @xmath5 where the nucleon contains only the nonperturbative valence and asymmetric sea quarks while the flavor symmetric sea quarks and gluons are not produced at this initial scale .",
    "once the asymmetric sea distributions at @xmath5 are determined , they will be given at any @xmath6 , which can be used to explain the experiments or to make predictions .",
    "it has been known that the application of the standard dglap equation is invalid at @xmath7 gev@xmath1 and this equation should be modified at small @xmath8 and low @xmath9 due to the correlations among partons .",
    "these nonlinear effects among partons to the dglap evolution have been shown in the perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "particularly , the present theory including the complete parton recombinations in the leading order ( lo ) approximation are derived by zhu , ruan and shen ( zrs ) @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations @xcite show that the negative nonlinear corrections can slow down the gluon splitting and improve the perturbative stability of the qcd evolution at low @xmath9 .",
    "although the contributions of the nonperturbative qcd effects to the measured structure functions at @xmath10 gev@xmath1 ( for example , the hadronic components in the virtual photon ) are necessary , these nonperturbative effects are strongly @xmath9-power suppressed and they do nt participate in the evolution of the parton distributions . it is found that the predicted parton distributions at @xmath11 gev@xmath1 of this approach are consistent with the experiments .    in this work , the asymmetric light sea and the valence quark distributions at the initial scale @xmath5 in the proton are determined from the experimental data . with",
