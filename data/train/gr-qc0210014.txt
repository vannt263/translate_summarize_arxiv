    "the proposed space - based mission of gravitational wave ( gw ) detection - the laser interferometric space antenna ( lisa ) - consists of three identical spacecrafts forming an equilateral triangle of side @xmath0 km following heliocentric orbits .",
    "lisa is thus a giant interferometric configuration with three arms which will give independent information on gw polarisations .",
    "the implementation of this huge michelson interferometer is quite different from the ground based interferometers like ligo , virgo etc . unlike in the ground based interferometric detectors , it is not feasible to bounce the laser beams because of the large armlengths involved .",
    "a special doppler tracking scheme is used to track the space crafts with laser beams .",
    "this exchange of laser beams between the three space - craft result in six doppler data streams .",
    "lisa sensitivity is limited by several noise sources .",
    "a major noise source is the laser phase noise which arises due to phase fluctuations of the master laser . amongst the important noise sources ,",
    "laser phase noise is expected to be several orders of magnitude larger than other noises in the instrument .",
    "the current stabilisation schemes estimate ( this estimate may improve in the future ) this noise to about @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the frequency of the laser and @xmath3 the fluctuation in frequency .",
    "if the laser frequency noise can be suppressed then the noise floor is determined by the optical - path noise which fakes fluctuations in the lengths of optical paths and the residual acceleration of proof masses resulting from imperfect shielding of the drag - free system .",
    "the noise floor is then at an effective gw strain sensitivity @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "thus , cancelling the laser frequency noise is vital if lisa is to reach the requisite sensitivity . since it is impossible to maintain equal distances between space - craft , cancellation of laser frequency noise",
    "is a non - trivial problem .",
    "several schemes have been proposed to combat this noise . in these schemes @xcite , the data streams are combined with appropriate time delays in order to cancel the laser frequency noise . in our earlier work @xcite , henceforth referred to as paper i , we had presented a systematic and rigorous method using commutative algebra which generates _ all _ the data combinations cancelling the laser frequency noise .",
    "these data combinations form a module over a polynomial ring , well known in the literature , as the _ first module of syzygies_. we obtained the generators of this module and hence the entire set of relevant data combinations could be generated conveniently .",
    "more importantly , we note that this method is general and can be extended to space - missions with more than three spacecrafts .",
    "in this paper we employ our previously set up formalism for two important applications : we compute the noise covariance matrix for lisa and obtain its eigenvectors and eigenvalues .",
    "the signal covariance matrix is computed for binaries whose frequency changes at most adiabatically ( the monochromatic case is included ) and for which the signal is averaged over polarisations and directions .",
    "here adiabatic means that the signal response , the noise and hence the snr change imperceptibly even if the gw source changes frequency during the observation time .",
    "thus , even though the results are presented at each fixed frequency , the sources need not be strictly monochromatic , and apply to a wider class of sources .",
    "the signal covariance matrix has the same eigenvectors as the noise covariance matrix which results in computational simplification .",
    "we show that the signal - to - noise ( snr ) for any data combination in the module , then lies between an upper and a lower bound .",
    "the upper and lower bounds of the snr are functions of frequency which are just the snr curves of the eigenvectors . the extremisation - both maximisation and minimisation - of snr is important for different purposes ; maximisation is important for the detection and parameter estimation of a gw source , while minimisation is important for the purpose of distinguishing the gw confusion noise from the instrumental noise @xcite .",
    "we further show that the bounding snr curves have multiple intersections within the band - width of lisa @xmath6 hz .",
    "the improvement of snr of the upper - bound over the michelson combination goes upto 70 % , but only at high frequencies @xmath7 mhz . at low frequencies",
    "@xmath8 5 mhz , both have the same sensitivity . since the eigenvectors are independent random variables , a ` network ' snr of independent detectors @xcite can be constructed from the likelihood considerations which gives an improvement between @xmath9 and @xmath10 over the maximum of snrs of the eigenvectors .",
    "the improvement over the michelson combination is about 40 % at low frequencies @xmath11 mhz and rises above 100 % at high frequencies .",
    "we may note that , some of our results are in agreement with independent and simultaneous calculations by prince _ et al _ @xcite .    tracking a gw source fixed on the celestial sphere for determining the snr",
    "constitutes a non - trivial problem , which will require substantial analysis when writing codes . here",
    ", we consider a simple toy model of lisa rotating in its own plane .",
    "our goal is to obtain a rough estimate in the improvement of snr by optimally switching from one data combination to another .",
    "we show that , if we implement this strategy , it is possible to improve the snr by about 55 % .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarise the main results of paper i. it has been shown earlier in the literature @xcite , that the laser phase noise and the optical bench motion noise in the lisa can be suppressed by combining the six beams appropriately delayed across arms of the interferometer .",
    "the six data streams are labelled as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the geometry of the lisa along with six laser beams is shown in the figure -[cap : lisa - geometry ] .",
    "the beams @xmath12 go clockwise while the @xmath13 go counter - clockwise .",
    "there are also six other beams connecting the two optical benches on each space - craft ( which are not shown in the figure ) . in the snr analysis",
    "only the _ difference _ between these beams is important .",
    "these differences are denoted by @xmath15 where the index @xmath16 corresponds to each space - craft labelled @xmath16 .",
    "+    in paper i , we have shown that _ all _ the data combinations which cancel the laser frequency noise and the bench motion noise form a module over a ring of polynomials in the three time delay operators @xmath17 , where @xmath18 represent delay operators of the light travel time along the three arms with lengths @xmath19 .",
    "thus for the data stream @xmath20 ( the speed of light is set to unity ) ; the operator @xmath21 delays the data stream by amount @xmath19 . for the lisa configuration @xmath22 seconds , corresponding to an arm - length of 5 million km .",
    "an important advantage of this formalism is that , one can generate the entire module from the generators ; linear combinations of the generators with polynomial coefficients in the ring generate this noise cancellation module .",
    "several sets of generators have been listed in paper i. based on the physical considerations or for the purpose of computational convenience , we may choose one set over another .",
    "for the purpose of extremising the snr , we choose the set of generators : @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( notation followed from @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath23 are cyclic permutations of each other .",
    "this symmetry comes in useful when computing scalar products between them and also in diagonalising the noise , and signal covariance matrices defined in the next section . following paper i , we list this generating set as 9-tuples of polynomials @xmath25 .",
    "the polynomials @xmath25 are polynomials in the variables @xmath21 and act on the data streams @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the linear combination @xmath27 cancels the laser frequency noise and optical bench motion noise when the 9-tuple @xmath25 is an element of the module of syzygies .",
    "the generators of the module are given by : @xmath28    we exhibit another set of generators @xmath29 which was obtained from the software package macaulay 2 @xcite .",
    "they can be related to the above set of generators by :    @xmath30    note that these sets of generators are not linearly independent . in particular ,",
    "the set of generators @xmath31 @xcite obey the following condition : @xmath32 when maximising the snr in the fourier space , this relation allows us to eliminate one of the generators at almost all frequencies , except when the product @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath34 is just the total time - delay @xmath35 around the lisa triangle .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we assume that all the arms of lisa are of equal length _",
    "i.e _ @xmath36 . in the fourier domain , _",
    "i.e , @xmath37 _ and the operator polynomials become actual polynomials .",
    "one can then solve for @xmath24 in terms of @xmath23 , _ except _ at the frequencies @xmath38 , when @xmath39 .",
    "taking @xmath40 km , the smallest such frequency @xmath41 is @xmath42 mhz .",
    "thus , @xmath43 and can be effectively eliminated while extremising snr , except at the singular frequencies . since snr computation",
    "can be successfully carried out for frequencies arbitrarily close to the singular frequencies , for the computation , the singularities do not seem to be important . in the analysis that follows ,",
    "we use only the three generators @xmath44 .",
    "in this section , we show that the set of generators @xmath44 can be combined into a new set , consisting of ` orthogonal ' eigenvectors .",
    "the noise covariance matrix naturally defines a positive definite , non - degenerate bilinear form , which serves as a scalar product or a metric .",
    "orthogonality between eigenvectors is defined in terms of this metric .",
    "physically this means that the noises of the eigenvectors are uncorrelated with each other .",
    "the eigenvectors are easily obtained by diagonalising the noise covariance matrix .",
    "the averaged signal matrix that we consider here has the same form as the noise covariance matrix and consequently has the same eigenvectors .",
    "thus this set of eigenvectors simultaneously diagonalises both matrices constituting the snr and simplifies the analysis that follows .",
    "an important observation here is that the eigenvectors are independent observables .",
    "they represent therefore statistically independent detectors ( so far as instrumental noises are concerned ) , and they can be treated as a network of detectors .",
    "furthermore , they can be combined in a root mean square fashion to yield a ` detector network statistic ' @xcite to yield a much improved sensitivity .      following the formalism in paper i",
    ", we define noise vectors in the fourier domain @xmath45 for each of the generators @xmath46 respectively , over the 12 dimensional complex space @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are power spectral densities ( psd ) of the proof mass residual motion and the optical path noise respectively .",
    "the polynomials @xmath51 , ( now actual polynomials in the fourier domain ) corresponding to the generators @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given in the equation ( [ eq : gen4 ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath55^{-2}\\ , hz^{-1}$ ] and @xmath56^{2}\\ , hz^{-1}$ ] following the literature @xcite .",
    "it can be easily shown that for a given data combination , the norm of the noise vector represents its noise psd .",
    "the noise covariance matrix for the generators @xmath46 is defined as @xmath57 and takes the simple form , @xmath58 .",

    "this was the reason a generating set possessing symmetry properties was chosen in the first place .",
    "a matrix with this form has two degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "thus , the eigenvalues of the noise covariance matrix are given by , @xmath64 since two of the eigenvalues are degenerate we need to systematically adopt a procedure for choosing the linearly independent and orthonormal set of eigenvectors .",
    "this choice is not unique .",
    "one such choice gives the following matrix @xmath65 @xmath66\\ , , \\label{eq : eigenmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which diagonalises the noise matrix @xmath67 , that is @xmath68 is diagonal , with eigenvalues as diagonal elements .",
    "the eigenvectors are : @xmath69    noise spectra of combinations @xmath70    we find that the data combination @xmath71 is proportional to the symmetric sagnac combination @xmath24 and has the same snr as that of @xmath72 .",

    "\\label{eq : gwresp}\\ ] ] here , @xmath74and @xmath75 are the antenna pattern functions .",
    "we note that the signal depends only on the first six entries @xmath76 of the 9-tuple describing a data combination .",
    "so while dealing with the signal response , we only consider the 6-tuple @xmath77 of the 9-tuple describing a data combination .",
    "we apply this formalism to a binary source which may be adiabatically changing in frequency .",
    "the two gw amplitudes of such a source at frequency @xmath38 are given by , @xmath78 here , the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 describe the orientation of the source and enter into the expressions for the polarisation amplitudes .",
    "the direction of the source on the celestial sphere is given by the angles @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in order to organise the calculations",
    ", we also define the detector response 6-tuple as , @xmath83 both @xmath84 and @xmath85 will be considered as row vectors for the purposes of defining matrix products . in order to analyse the signal covariance matrix , it is useful to define a scalar product . for two data combinations @xmath84 and @xmath86 ( considered as row vectors ) , we define the scalar product as follows : @xmath87 where , @xmath88 is a hermitian matrix of detector responses and the ` dot ' denotes the matrix product . the norm of the vector @xmath84 is then given by , @xmath89 the norm of @xmath84 is the gw response for the data combination described by @xmath84 .",
    "the signal covariance matrix for any generating set @xmath90 ( and corresponding @xmath91 ) is then defined as , @xmath92 where , @xmath93 and the bracket @xmath94 represents the average over the polarisations and directions .",
    "taking @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 as the generators , the cyclic symmetry between them gives rise to a signal covariance matrix @xmath95 which has the same form as the noise covariance matrix @xmath67 given in equation ( [ eq : nomat ] ) . in this case",
    "the @xmath96 and @xmath97 are replaced by @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "thus @xmath100 is diagonalised by the similarity transformation @xmath101 and has the _ same _ eigenvectors @xmath102 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath95 are given by @xmath103    this simultaneous diagonalisation of both signal and noise matrices is important from the point of extremisation of snr .",
    "this forms the content of the next subsection .",
    "however , we may note that in the formalism developed by prince _",
    "et al _ @xcite , the optimisation is performed without averaging over the source directions and polarisations , which results in the gw source matrix of rank @xmath104 . since , the source directions are not known in general , we average over these parameters which results in a signal matrix of rank @xmath105 .",
    "an arbitrary data combination can be written as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 are polynomials in @xmath108 .",

    "when @xmath119 , the snr is a strictly monotonic function of the ratio @xmath120 . if @xmath121 then the snr of the generator @xmath122 or @xmath123 is greater than that of @xmath71 .",
    "then for these frequencies @xmath122 or @xmath123 ( or any linear combination of them ) yields the maximum snr while @xmath71 yields minimum snr . when @xmath124 , the opposite is true : @xmath122 or @xmath123 ( or any linear combination of them ) yield the minimum snr while @xmath71 yields maximum snr .",
    "the remaining case , when @xmath125 all the @xmath102 have the same snr . since the extremum values of snr are only attained by the eigenvectors ,",

    "the improvement of the network snr over the michelson combination is about 40 % at low frequencies @xmath11 mhz and rises above 100 % at high frequencies .",

    "we have shown that , if this strategy is used , it is possible to improve the snr by about 55 % on an average over the band - width of lisa .",
    "we also show that if we instead maximise over the module , the snr improves by about 60 % on an average over the lisa band - width .",
    "these improvements are obtained using just one data combination , namely , the eigenvector @xmath122 . the snr improvement in both cases is larger at higher frequencies @xmath158 mhz than at low frequencies .",

    "<S> it has been shown in several recent papers that the six doppler data streams obtained from a triangular lisa configuration can be combined by appropriately delaying the data streams for cancelling the laser frequency noise . </S>",
    "<S> raw laser noise is several orders of magnitude above the other noises and thus it is essential to bring it down to the level of other noises such as shot , acceleration , etc . </S>",
    "<S> a rigorous and systematic formalism using the powerful techniques of computational commutative algebra was developed which generates in principle _ all _ the data combinations cancelling the laser frequency noise . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant data combinations form a first module of syzygies .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we use this formalism to advantage for optimising the sensitivity of lisa by analysing the noise and signal covariance matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the signal covariance matrix is calculated for binaries whose frequency changes at most adiabatically and the signal is averaged over polarisations and directions . </S>",
    "<S> we then present the extremal snr curves for all the data combinations in the module . </S>",
    "<S> they correspond to the eigenvectors of the noise and signal covariance matrices . a lisa ` network ' snr </S>",
    "<S> is also computed by combining the outputs of the eigenvectors . </S>",
    "<S> we show that substantial gains in sensitivity can be obtained by employing these strategies . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum snr curve can yield an improvement upto 70 % over the michelson , mainly at high frequencies , while the improvement using the network snr ranges from 40 % to over 100 % .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we describe a simple toy model , in which lisa rotates in a plane . in this analysis , we estimate the improvement in the lisa sensitivity , if one switches from one data combination to another as it rotates . here the improvement in sensitivity , if one switches optimally over three cyclic data combinations of the eigenvector is about 55 % on an average over the lisa band - width . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding snr improvement increases to 60 % , if one maximises over the module . </S>"
