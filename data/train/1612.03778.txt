    "is `` dimension deficit '' really the correct physical meaning of the parameter @xmath4 in dimensional regularization ? the only way to prove it is by explicitly constructing a fractal spacetime on which dimensional regularization approximates quantum - field amplitudes .",
    "introducing such a construction for scalar - only quantum field theories is the purpose of this paper .",
    "ideally , this is the first step in a longer research program aimed at extending this construction to non - scalar fields . even if that does nt materialize , the scalar construction should be of interest in its own right , as it casts a fresh light on the foundations of dimensional regularization , one of the cornerstones of modern quantum field theory .",
    "after all , other schemes such as pauli  villars and lattice regularization have well - defined physical meanings that enable scientists to benefit from intuition established in a variety of other domains . why not dimensional regularization ?    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] presents essential concepts and argumentation about dimensional regularization and fractals , and sets the stage for the constructions and derivations that follow .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] derives the power - law screening characteristic of dimensional regularization for propagators on fractals defined by removing voids from @xmath2-dimensional euclidean space , in order to establish basic intuition and lines of argumentation .",
    "the results of section  [ sec3 ] apply techniques from elementary dielectric theory .",
    "surprisingly , fractal geometry by itself does not guarantee the power - law behavior required for dimensional regularization ; boundary conditions at fractal voids also play an important role .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] extends section  [ sec3 ] to fractals in @xmath3-dimensional minkowski space .",
    "note that in section  [ sec4 ] the fractals themselves are not lorentz invariant , but that s alright because ( see below ) anisotropy in fractal power - law scaling appears to have no impact on dimensional regularization for small @xmath4 .",
    "( we will in fact argue that there is no such thing as a relativistically invariant fractal with dimension greater than @xmath1 . ) section  [ sec5 ] contains a discussion of weaknesses in our reasoning , as well as prospects for generalization to non - scalar fields , and speculation about implications for quantum gravity .",
    "dimensional regularization @xcite for scalar fields amounts to changing the momentum - space volume element @xmath5 in feynman diagrams to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the minkowski norm of momentum @xmath8 , @xmath4 is positive and @xmath9 is a fixed scale .",
    "the important thing is that the multiplier behaves like a fractional power of the scale factor as @xmath8 scales to infinity along any fixed direction .",
    "that is what turns logarithmic divergences in @xmath8 into poles in @xmath4 .",
    "this has the same effect as multiplying the scalar propagator ( instead of the integration volume ) in momentum space by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , because the only divergent loops have two scalar propagators .",
    "for this reason , the goal of the fractal constructions that follow is to show that scalar propagators in fractal spacetimes exhibit screening of the form @xmath10 in momentum space for large momentum @xmath8 or , as appropriate , @xmath12 in position space for small position @xmath13 and non - negative @xmath14 .",
    "( more precisely , when quantum amplitudes are defined by path integrals over random fractals [ see below ] obtained by removing voids from linear spacetime , then the quantum amplitudes , when ensemble - averaged over random fractals , numerically correspond to feynman diagrams in the underlying integer - dimensional linear spacetime with propagators screened as described above . )",
    "there is a hitch , however . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we shall find ourselves dealing with fractals that are not themselves lorentz - invariant .",
    "this means that we will really show that propagators in position space scale as @xmath15 at short distance or @xmath16 at large momentum , where @xmath17 is solid angle in four dimensions and @xmath18 or @xmath19 is some function that s nonzero almost everywhere . but that s alright as far as lorentz - invariance of quantum amplitudes is concerned , because the function @xmath18 has no _ material _ impact on dimensional regularization for small dimension deficit : small @xmath4 ( or @xmath14 ) ensures that integration over @xmath17 does nt diverge ; and ignoring terms of order @xmath4 and higher ensures that the only quantitative effect that @xmath19 has on feynman integrals is to modify the effective value of @xmath9 , because the @xmath20 term in @xmath21 can only manifest itself by multiplying the @xmath22 linear - scale divergence by the integral of @xmath23 $ ] over all solid angles .    the constructions in this paper focus on random `` take - away '' fractals .",
    "randomness exempts us from the complications of accidental crystallographic symmetries . for the purposes of this paper , a random `` take - away ''",
    "fractal is a set formed by the following recursive procedure : start with a linear space of integer dimension @xmath24 , and a reference void of volume @xmath25 .",
    "distribute points randomly throughout space with arbitrary density @xmath26 , and , centered at each such point , remove a copy of the reference void . call this the zeroth iteration .",
    "now choose an arbitrary scale factor @xmath27 and define the @xmath28th iteration inductively as follows :    * distribute points randomly with density @xmath29 throughout whatever part of the euclidean space has not been removed by preceding iterations .",
    "* centered at each such point , remove from the @xmath30st iteration a copy of the reference void linearly scaled by factor @xmath31 .    in the limit of infinite @xmath28 , what s left has fractal dimension @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath33 is the volumetric proportion of iteration @xmath30 removed by iteration @xmath28 , and the ratio of logarithms is clearly minus a dimension deficit for physical @xmath34 .",
    "( the geometry of the reference void can have its own probability distribution , but this is more generality than we require .",
    "also , for small @xmath35 it is unimportant that voids removed at iteration @xmath28 might overlap with one another or with voids removed at earlier iterations . )",
    "a _ relativistic _ fractal would have a lorentz - invariant reference void .",
    "but such a void  bounded by hyperbolic spheres  would have infinite @xmath25 .",
    "interestingly , if the starting linear space had dimension @xmath36 , a fractal could still be defined .",
    "for example , consider as a reference void the space between a forward light cone and a mass shell .",
    "basically this is a central lobe flaring into two wings whose thickness falls like one over the distance from the vertex .",
    "a random distribution of such voids produces a fractal after just a single iteration , because there are @xmath37 void centers at distance @xmath38 from any reference point , and their wing width falls like @xmath39 ( basically , @xmath39 is analogous to @xmath40 in the fundamental fractal definition , and @xmath41 is analogous to @xmath29 ) . for arbitrary @xmath24",
    "the number of void centers at distance @xmath38 is proportional to @xmath42 but wing ( really a cup lip ) width still falls like @xmath39 , so the two factors match only for @xmath36 and we conclude that there probably are no relativistic fractals in higher dimensions .",
    "this reinforces the importance of our earlier discussion about lorentz invariance vs.  nontrivial @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "perhaps this uniqueness of @xmath36 is behind the tendency of renormalization - group flows to converge to @xmath1-dimensional fractals in reduced models of gravity @xcite .",
    "[ alternatively , one might construct a relativistic fractal by replacing the idea of a single infinite - volume lorentz - invariant reference void with an appropriately weighted ensemble of voids created by applying lorentz boosts to a single finite - volume `` seed '' void .",
    "but one is driven to the same conclusion about @xmath43 because the lorentz - invariant measure on the set of all boosts has itself infinite total weight . ]",
    "as indicated above , the narrow mathematical objective of this paper is to derive power - law screening at small distances or large momenta for wave - equation propagators in @xmath3-dimensional minkowski space limited by a fractal distribution of voids . to make the thought process as clear as possible",
    ", we build to this objective with three cases of successively increasing sophistication .",
    "the last case is minkowski space .",
    "for the first case , consider recovering the @xmath44 green s function for potential theory in two dimensions by limiting three dimensions to the space between two closely - separated parallel planes . in school",
    "we encounter the problem of a point charge between two parallel conducting planes , but because the infinite sequence of image charges involves alternating signs , the potential does not approach @xmath44 for vanishing plane separation @xcite .",
    "if instead of conducting planes",
    " i.e.  constant - value dirichlet boundary condition  we impose the other canonical potential - theory boundary condition  zero - normal - derivative neumann  the image charges are in the same locations but all have identical sign .",
    "so they add coherently to produce @xmath44 for vanishingly small plane separation .",
    "naively , the coefficient of @xmath44 diverges as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the original point charge and @xmath47 is plane separation , but @xmath47 cancels out because the 2d green s function is meant to be integrated over the limiting plane , while in 3d it s to be integrated over the space between the converging planes , and that volume is proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "this sets a pattern for the cases that follow : invocation of neumann boundary conditions modulated by vanishing volume between voids .    for the second case ,",
    "consider the green s function at short distance for potential theory in @xmath48-dimensional euclidean space limited by a fractal distribution of spherical voids .",
    "if the spheres are small , the field around each primarily induces an electrostatic dipole @xcite with polarizability @xmath49 for the spheres of iteration @xmath28 . according to dielectric theory @xcite",
    ", these spheres collectively amplify or shield a distant charge by a factor @xmath50^{-1}. \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] each iteration of the fractal process multiplies the green s function ( potential ) of a point charge by this factor in the space between spheres , _ but only for iterations whose spheres are smaller than the distance to the point charge _ , since larger spheres do nt fit . at the same time",
    ", each iteration also multiplies the point - charge potential by a factor of @xmath33 for integration volume regardless of sphere size .",
    "in other words , the green s function for point charge @xmath46 becomes @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the highest iteration whose spheres are larger than or equal to @xmath38 .",
    "for the infinite product to be well - defined , @xmath53 must be unity .",
    "thus we discover that spheres have to come in a mix of boundary conditions so that on average @xmath54    it is elementary to show that polarizability for a spherical void at iteration @xmath28 is @xmath55 for dirichlet boundary conditions and @xmath56 for neumann .",
    "so eq .   says that for every iteration the voids must be a mix of @xmath57 neumann and @xmath58 dirichlet . as a result",
    ", expression reduces to @xmath59 since @xmath52 satisfies @xmath60 radius of iteration-@xmath52 sphere , proportional to @xmath61 , expression amounts to power - law screening of the form @xmath62 the exponent in expression is the dimension deficit .",
    "in minkowski space , we must step away from fractals defined by spherical voids because the wave equation  rather than poisson s equation  prevails .",
    "the @xmath3-space wave equation is governed by initial conditions on @xmath2-dimensional space and boundary conditions on @xmath1-dimensional walls , in contrast with the @xmath3-space poisson equation , which would require conditions on the entirety of arbitrarily shaped @xmath2-dimensional boundaries .",
    "for this reason we now assume cylindrical voids , parallel to the time axis and @xmath2-dimensionally spherical in cross - section ( or that we re in a lorentz frame in which the voids look that way ) .",
    "the fractal is now the distribution of cross - section @xmath2-spheres in position space ; @xmath26 and @xmath25 now refer directly to that distribution .",
    "( voids parallel to the time axis also guarantees time - translation invariance and therefore hamiltonian quantum dynamics and unitarity . )    as before , we want to demonstrate that the fractal has the effect of multiplying the lorentz - invariant free - space propagator by an expression similar to . we can confine the demonstration to the vicinity of the light cone , since that s the only region where the free - space propagator , @xmath63 with infinitesimal @xmath64 , really matters .",
    "( also , we assume the scalar field is massless because we re only interested in short distances . ) near the light cone , propagation past a @xmath3-cylinder looks like a plane wave passing a polarizable @xmath2-sphere . and",
    "as long as the width of the plane - wave pulse @xmath65 sphere separation , the basic logic of the dielectric model in section  [ sec3 ] still applies , leading again to the multiplier , because scattered fields in the near field exactly reproduce statically induced dipoles ( see for example ( * ? ?",
    ".    if plane - wave pulse - width not @xmath65 sphere separation , then presumably scattered waves from nearby spheres are unable to add coherently , in which case one ca nt include the factor @xmath66 for that separation . in this way position - space power - law screening is augmented by an extra momentum - space factor @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the source frequency .",
    "by focusing on scalar fields , we have begun a longer - term attempt to provide an explicit physical basis for dimensional regularization . in this paper ,",
    "dimensional regularization emerges as a considerable idealization : it ignores non - unity @xmath69 or @xmath70 for small @xmath4 ; and fractal screening ( expression ) is really stepwise , not literally a smooth power law ( although perhaps the steps can be eliminated by defining the fractal in the limit of vanishing @xmath71 and @xmath35 with finite ratio ) .",
    "these non - idealizations clearly depend on details of how the underlying fractal is defined .",
    "we readily acknowledge weaknesses in our reasoning .",
    "in particular , it hinges on various approximations and idealizations , including a reliance on spherical voids or cross sections , dipole - only responses , and multiplicatively iterative dielectric calculations .",
    "but if the fractal construction really does generalize to all types of fields ( and if it also generalizes to curved geometries ) , then one can speculate that literally setting spacetime s dimension to @xmath72 might render gravity s renormalizability a non - issue without unification with other forces or as - yet unobserved symmetries ( assuming nothing discontinuous but essential happens at @xmath73 ) .",
    "such a scenario has some numerical plausibility : consider quantum corrections to the einstein ",
    "hilbert lagrangian @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is proportional to newton s constant ; @xmath19 is the determinant of the metric tensor ; and @xmath76 is the ricci scalar , essentially a sum of curvature components .",
    "assume gravity is minimally coupled to matter fields but not otherwise unified with matter .",
    "the simplest induced nonrenormalizable interactions , from coupling to a massless scalar field @xcite or massless photons @xcite , are in one loop and proportional to @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is quadratic in curvature components .",
    "dimensionally , the generic proportionality constant can only be a geometric - combinatoric number times @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the planck length . the tightest `` fifth force '' observational bound @xcite on @xmath81 extensions of the einstein ",
    "hilbert action ( i.e.  @xmath82 ) is @xmath83m@xmath84 , suggesting @xmath85 ( ignoring geometric and combinatoric factors ) , easily small enough to have escaped observation .",
    "this echoes an earlier suggestion @xcite that gravity s non - renormalizability could be mitigated with a self - similar distribution of virtual black holes ."
