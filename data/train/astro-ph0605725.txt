    "mixing can be enhanced by rotation @xcite .",
    "suppose that the pop iii sn progenitors were rotating faster than more massive stars because of smaller mass loss , then [ n / fe ] was enhanced as observed in emp stars .      in the early galactic epoch when the galaxy was not yet chemically well - mixed , each emp star may be formed mainly from the ejecta of a single pop iii sn ( although some of them might be the second or later generation sne ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the formation of emp stars was driven by a supernova shock , so that [ fe / h ] was determined by the ejected fe mass and the amount of circumstellar hydrogen swept - up by the shock wave @xcite .",
    "then , hypernovae with larger @xmath4 are likely to induce the formation of stars with smaller [ fe / h ] , because the mass of interstellar hydrogen swept up by a hypernova is roughly proportional to @xmath4 @xcite and the ratio of the ejected iron mass to @xmath4 is smaller for hypernovae than for normal supernovae .",
    "the theoretical yields are compared with the averaged abundance pattern of four emp stars , cs  22189 - 009 , cd-38:245 , cs  22172 - 002 and cs  22885 - 096 , which have low metallicity ( @xmath46}<-3.5 $ ] ) and normal [ c / fe ] @xmath47 @xcite .",

    "the next question is why he13272326 has a much larger n / c ratio than he01075240 . in our models ,",
    "a significant amount of n is produced by the mixing between the he convective shell and the h - rich envelope during the presupernova evolution  @xcite , where c created by the triple-@xmath34 reaction is burnt into n through the cn cycle .",
    "for the he13272326 model , we assume about 30 times larger diffusion coefficients ( i.e. , faster mixing ) for the h and he convective shells to overcome an inhibiting effect of the mean molecular weight gradient ( and also entropy gradient ) between h and he layers .",
    "thus , larger amounts of protons are carried into the he convective shell .",
    "then [ c / n ] @xmath47 is realized as observed in he13272326 .",
    "such an enhancement of mixing efficiency has been suggested to take place in the present - day massive stars known as fast rotators , which show various n and he enrichments due to different rotation velocities  @xcite .",
    "recent works have taken into account the nlte effects and 3d effects , and obtained [ o / fe ] @xcite . the resultant abundance patters are shown in figure [ fig5 ] ( lower ) and the newly obtained [ o / fe ] in he13272326 is consistent with our theoretical models .",

    "we discuss nucleosynthesis in bipolar ( jet - like ) explosions @xcite .    in the jet - like explosion model ,",
    "the shock wave is stronger along the @xmath95-axis and heats up the stellar material to higher temperatures . along the @xmath84-axis ,",
    "temperatures are lower because of the weaker shock and densities are higher because of mass accretion .",
    "therefore , the materials along the @xmath95-axis occupy the high entropy region in the @xmath96 plane , while those in the r - axis form the lowest bound of entropy . as a result , @xmath0ni is synthesized preferentially along the @xmath95-axis , while a lot of unburned materials , mainly o , are left at low velocity in the @xmath84-plane .    because the bipolar models preferentially eject the materials experiencing higher temperatures ( higher entropies ) in complete silicon burning , the ratios @xmath35ti/@xmath0ni and @xmath37ge/@xmath0ni are significantly larger in the bipolar models than spherical models .",
    "such an enhancement of the @xmath34-rich freezeout products is seen in figure [ fmae2 ] . for a given mass of @xmath0ni , the aspherical models ( denoted as 40a , b , c ) eject larger amount of @xmath35ti and @xmath37zn .",
