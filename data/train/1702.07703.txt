    "this is because @xmath158 is linear and the @xmath0-ary sum of two codewords in @xmath155 can be decomposed as the sum of a codeword in @xmath158 and a codeword in @xmath155 . in this case",

    "[ th : binary_jpl2 ]    the key point is to observe that any code @xmath150 of rate @xmath147 admits a subcode of rate at least @xmath266 whose codewords are all pairwise confusable .",

    "then @xmath269 may be now thought to be defined over a binary alphabet , which is the input of a binary _ asymmetric _ erasure channel .",
    "then from @xmath269 we may select a full - rate constant - composition subcode @xmath277 .",
    "it is well known , e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "10.20c ) , that for such a subcode @xmath277 the probability of error is lower - bounded by @xmath278 where @xmath279 is the minimal hamming distance of @xmath277 .",
    "( note that here we also used the explicit expression for the bhattacharya distance as in  ( [ eq : bhatta ] ) . ) from  @xcite it follows that @xmath280    we observe that theorem [ th : binary_jpl2 ] implies @xmath281 which improves the sphere packing bound @xmath282 for @xmath283 . in this case one can combine theorem [ th : binary_jpl2 ] with the straight line bound , which asserts that any line connecting a point at @xmath284 on the curve of a low - rate upper bound on @xmath9 to a point on the curve of the sphere packing bound at a higher rate @xmath285 is also an upper bound on @xmath9 in the intermediate range of rate values @xmath286 .",
    "it is worth discussing  ( [ eq : logq/2-bound ] ) in more detail for even values of @xmath0 . in this case ,",
    "in fact , the lower bound we derived in section [ sec : new_lb ] is a @xmath72-shifted version of the expurgated bound for the bsc , and the same is true for the sphere packing bound .",
    "given the structure of the proof , one might then expect that our upper bound should match the lower bound as happens at @xmath73 for the bsc .",
    "the comment in the previous paragraph implies that this is not the case ; it is actually easy to check that the upper bound in  ( [ eq : logq/2-bound ] ) is off by @xmath287 compared to the lower bound of theorem [ th : gv - expurgatedbound ] at the same rate , and the reader might wonder what is happening .",
    "implicit in the proofs of theorems [ th : gv - expurgatedbound ] and [ th : binary_jpl2 ] ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) ) is the fact that , for even @xmath0 , the largest possible minimum distance ( with our semimetric ) of codes at @xmath288 is known and it is precisely @xmath3 .",
    "so one might expect that the exact value of @xmath289 should also be known .",
    "the main reason why this is not so is the possible presence of many codeword pairs at minimum distance .",
    "our procedure in theorem [ th : binary_jpl2 ] gives a _ upper _ bound on @xmath9 by lower bounding the probability of error in a binary hypothesis test between _ two _ codewords at minimum distance .",
    "however , our _ lower _ bound on @xmath9 in theorem [ th : gv - expurgatedbound ] uses codes such that any codeword has @xmath163 neighboring codewords at minimum distance @xmath162 . when plugged in the union bound",
    ", this leads to the mentioned gap between lower and upper bounds on @xmath9 .",
    "note in particular that this effect is related to the coefficient @xmath163 which relates @xmath181 to @xmath167 in  ( [ eq : fromatobspectrum ] ) already mentioned at the end of the proof of theorem [ th : gv - expurgatedbound ] .",
    "since we have no insight on possible improvements of theorem [ th : gv - expurgatedbound ] while we do know of cases where theorem [ th : binary_jpl2 ] is even weaker than the sphere packing bound , we deduce that theorem [ th : binary_jpl2 ] is weak because it fails to catch the possible presence of a high number of neighbors .",
    "we will see later ( see remark [ rem : spectrum_evenq ] in section [ sec : new_up_spectrum ] ) that a different procedure does allow one to prove the presence of an exponential number of neighbors , though it turns out to be difficult to convert this into a good bound on the probability of error for the asymmetric case of @xmath290 , which is unfortunately the only interesting one for even values of @xmath0 .",
    "we finally comment on the optimal use of the straight line bound for odd @xmath0 using known results in the literature .",
    "the sphere packing bound and theorem [ th : binary_jpl2 ] are only useful at rates larger than @xmath72 .",
    "however , for odd @xmath0 , lovsz bound on the zero - error capacity implies that @xmath9 is finite for all rates @xmath291 , where @xmath292 is the lovsz theta function of equation  ( [ eq : lovasz_theta_cq ] ) .",
    "it is then possible to use the straight line bound in a rather simple way .",
    "any code of rate @xmath293 has a positive _ maximal _ probability of error , and this can not be smaller than @xmath294 , since @xmath79 is the smallest non - zero transition probability . hence , the reliability function satisfies @xmath295 for @xmath293 and application of the straight line bound gives the following result .    for odd @xmath0 ,",
    "the segment connecting the point @xmath296 tangentially to the sphere packing curve in the @xmath297 plane is an upper bound on @xmath9 .      in this section",
    "we present a new upper bound on @xmath9 for typewriter channels based on minimum distance .",
    "our focus here is on the case where @xmath0 is odd .",
    "furthermore , although we state the bound for general @xmath79 , it is developed with a main focus on the symmetric case @xmath27 . in the next section we will derive an improved version of the bound which only holds for @xmath27 .",
    "we believe the case @xmath298 would be worth attention for the extension of that bound rather than the optimization of the current one .",
    "the main contribution of the bound presented here relies on combining bounds on the zero - error capacity with bounds on minimum distance of codes , which allows us to derive a new upper bound on @xmath9 for rates larger than lovsz s upper bound on @xmath16 .",
    "more specifically , our bound derives from an instance of the delsarte linear programming bound @xcite which combines the construction used by lovsz for bounding the graph capacity @xcite with the construction used in @xcite to bound the minimum distance of codes in hamming spaces .",
    "[ th : elp ] for odd @xmath0 and any @xmath299 we have @xmath300 whenever @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the linear programming bound for codes in a @xmath303-ary hamming space @xcite ( with @xmath303 not necessarily integral ) and @xmath304 is the lovsz @xmath92-function for the @xmath0-cycle @xmath25 .",
    "we lower bound the maximal probability of error over all codewords @xmath305 , which in turn we bound in terms of an upper bound on the minimum distance of codes for the distance measure introduced in the previous section .",
    "note in particular that we have @xmath306 indeed , if there is no pair of confusable codewords , then the inequality is trivial .",
    "if instead codewords @xmath47 and @xmath48 are confusable , then they share a common output sequence which can be reached with probability at least @xmath307 by both input @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; upon receiving it , any ( possibly randomized ) decoder will decode in error with probability at least @xmath3 either when codeword @xmath47 or codeword @xmath48 is sent .",
    "so , we can bound the reliability as @xmath308 the rest of this section is devoted to bounding the minimum distance .",
    "in particular we prove that codes for which @xmath309 have rate @xmath29 upper bounded as @xmath310 note that theorem [ th : elp ] follows from equations  ( [ eq : etod])-  ( [ eq : r_lp_rlp ] ) .    our bound is based on @xmath92 functions and delsarte s linear programming bound @xcite , but it is easier to describe it in terms of fourier transforms . for any @xmath311 we define its fourier transform as @xmath312 where the non - degenerate @xmath5-valued bilinear form is defined as usual @xmath313 we also define the inner product as follows @xmath314    the starting point is a known rephrasing of linear programming bound .",
    "let @xmath315 be a code with minimum distance at least @xmath162 .",
    "let @xmath316 be such that @xmath317 if @xmath318 , @xmath319 and @xmath320 .",
    "then , consider the plancherel identity @xmath321 where @xmath322 is the indicator function of a set @xmath323 .",

    "so , in this case @xmath439",
    "\\leq 2^{-(\\tau+\\delta/2)n}$ ] .",
    "so , from  ( [ eq : decaen ] ) we get @xmath444 this quantity is exponentially asymptotic to @xmath445 whenever @xmath446 .",

    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "[ rem : spectrum_evenq ] it is worth pointing out that the proof of the theorem could be extended to the case of even @xmath0 , with the only difference that @xmath460 , @xmath461 and @xmath462 in that case",
    ". however , for even @xmath0 the assumption @xmath27 is not really interesting since @xmath463 .",
    "what is instead interesting is that the bounds derived on the spectrum would mainly differ from the bounds derived for the binary case in @xcite for the presence of a coefficient @xmath464 in the @xmath47-th term of equation  ( [ eq : boundr - kl - like ] ) ( other than a shift of @xmath72 on the @xmath29 axis of course ) .",
    "this agrees with the relation in equation  ( [ eq : fromatobspectrum ] ) which expresses the spectrum of our codes for the even length cycle in terms of the spectrum of the used binary code .",
    "this should be compared to what we said about theorem [ th : binary_jpl2 ] , mentioning that it fails to spot the presence of a high number of neighbors even for even values of @xmath0 .",
    "the approach developed in this section suggests that it is indeed possible to prove the presence of those neighbors but unfortunately this would only be useful for the case @xmath465 , for which it is difficult to convert efficiently the bound on the spectrum to a bound on the probability of error .",
    "we observe that this difficulty arises from the asymmetry introduced by the condition @xmath465 which makes the channel not _ pairwise reversible _ in the sense of @xcite . in the case where @xmath258 , the tightness of the expurgated bound at @xmath73 for such channels was obtained using berlekamp s complicated procedure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "still , that method essentially works to achieve a bound on the minimum distance between two sequences .",
    "so , we believe that a very interesting result worth pursuing would be the extension of the bound presented in this section to the case of even @xmath0 and @xmath465 , which might need the combination of berlekamp s technique with the kalai - linial method and would perhaps allow to close the gap between upper and lower bounds at @xmath466 for even @xmath0 ( see remark [ rem : gap_evenq ] ) .",
