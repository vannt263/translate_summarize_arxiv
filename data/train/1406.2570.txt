    "strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of temperature and density has been a matter of interest over the last decades , related to the understanding of the strong interaction @xcite as well as the analysis of compact stars . in particular , strange pseudoscalar mesons in matter have been throughly investigated in exotic atoms @xcite , heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) @xcite and neutron stars @xcite .    the phenomenology of kaonic atoms @xcite requires an attractive potential for @xmath8 mesons whereas the @xmath7 scattering amplitude in vacuum is repulsive at low energies due to the presence of the @xmath3 resonance below the @xmath7 threshold . indeed",
    ", this resonance has been throughly analyzed in photon induced reactions by the clas collaboration @xcite and in proton - proton reactions by the anke experiment @xcite , and more recently by the hades at gsi @xcite .",
    "the onset of an attractive @xmath7 interaction at low densities is a consequence of an upper shift of the @xmath3 resonance induced by pauli blocking on the intermediate nucleon states @xcite .",
    "additional medium effects such as the self - energy of mesons in related coupled channels and the binding of hyperons in the nuclear environment bring a smoothened @xmath9 back to its vacuum position @xcite , while keeping the attractive character of the @xmath7 interaction in matter .",
    "unitarized chiral coupled - channel approaches @xcite with a self - consistent evaluation of the kaon self - energy @xcite have proven to be very successful in describing the @xmath8 meson interaction in matter .",
    "an attractive potential of about 40 - 60  mev at normal nuclear matter density is obtained when self - consistency is implemented , rather shallow as compared to relativistic mean - field calculations @xcite or phenomenological analysis of kaonic atom data with density dependent potentials including non - linearities @xcite . yet",
    ", this shallow potential is able to reproduce the data from kaonic atoms @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 meson interaction with nucleons has also been addressed recently in connection to the possible formation of deeply bound kaonic states after the prediction of narrow strongly bound states in few - body systems @xcite .",
    "this analysis was strongly criticized @xcite due to the unrealistic treatment of the @xmath7 interaction .",
    "recent improved calculations using different few - body methods with diverse @xmath10 input @xcite predict few - nucleon kaonic states with large widths , although the predicted binding energies and widths differ substantially from one model to the other .",
    "thus , the experimental quest for such deeply bound kaonic states is an active field of research @xcite , that will allow to further constrain the @xmath7 interaction in the near future .",
    "moreover , the in - medium modification of kaon / antikaon properties has been explored experimentally close to threshold in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies @xcite . with the help of microscopic transport models @xcite",
    "the creation and transport of kaons / antikaons has been studied revealing a complicated multiple interaction scenario of the strange particles with hadronic matter whose consequences show up in the measured spectra and kaon flow characteristics .",
    "the strangeness production in heavy - ion collisions is very different from that in elementary interactions as the excitation functions for kaons and antikaons show .",
    "the comparison of transport model calculations with experimental results ( such as production cross sections , energy and polar angular distributions , azimuthal anisotropy coefficients @xmath11 etc . )",
    "indicate that in matter the kaons are affected by a shallow repulsive potential whereas the antikaon dynamics are influenced by a much stronger attractive potential .    for kaons",
    "the spectral function is very narrow and therefore it behaves almost as a good quasi - particle . for antikaons",
    "the situation is much more uncertain .",
    "this is due to three reasons : a ) they have a broad spectral function due to strong interactions with the baryons .",
    "b ) the simple @xmath12 approximation for the antikaon optical potential does not work in the @xmath13 channel since this scattering amplitude is dominated by the @xmath3 resonance and is repulsive in vacuum .",
    "c ) the measured excitation function of the antikaon yield close to threshold energies confirms that the @xmath14 reaction is the dominant channel for antikaon production in heavy - ion collisions @xcite since the hyperons are more abundantly produced together with kaons .",
    "this cross section is expected to be substantially modified in the hot and dense medium .",
    "for all these reasons it is very important to incorporate a self - consistent treatment of the @xmath8 self energy and the @xmath8 scattering amplitudes in transport calculations .",
    "the first transport calculations for antikaon observables in nuclear matter were performed assuming that the finite width of the antikaon spectral function might be neglected @xcite .",
    "these calculations revealed the strangeness exchange reaction as the dominant production channel and the existence of an attractive antikaon optical potential .",
    "some years later antikaon production was studied using off - shell dynamics with in - medium spectral functions in the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) transport model @xcite employing the jlich meson - exchange model @xcite as the effective @xmath10 interaction in matter .",
    "multiplicity ratios involving strange mesons coming from heavy - ion collisions data were analyzed in @xcite .    during the last decade",
    "several conclusions on the production mechanisms for strangeness have been achieved by the analysis of experimental data in conjunction with microscopic transport approaches , i.e. the production mechanisms of strangeness , the different freeze - out conditions exhibited by @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons and the use of @xmath15 as a probe of the nuclear matter equation of state at high baryon densities .",
    "still , the analysis of all experimental antikaon observables has not allowed so far for a consensus on the antikaon cross sections and optical potential ( cf . the recent review @xcite ) .",
    "for example , recent experimental data on the @xmath11 flow of strange mesons @xcite show a sensitivity to the details of the in - medium meson - baryon interaction , leaving room for a more elaborate description within hadronic models .    a model for the @xmath7 interaction at finite density and",
    "zero temperature has been recently developed within a chiral unitarity approach in coupled channels by incorporating the @xmath0- and @xmath1- waves of the kaon - nucleon interaction in a self - consistent manner @xcite .",
    "finite temperature effects have been also implemented @xcite , although only a full self - consistent solution for @xmath0- wave effective @xmath10 interaction was reached as the @xmath1-wave contribution was treated by means of hyperon - nucleon insertions . in this work we aim at improving on the chiral effective scheme in dense matter developed in refs .",

    "still , the @xmath1-wave self - energy of kaons and antikaons was calculated at the level of single hyperon - hole insertions and not within the present unitarized and self - consistent scheme .",
    "thus , although we were able to obtain the @xmath1-wave self - energy , which was evaluated in terms of finite - temperature hyperon - hole lindhard functions including baryonic mean - field potentials , a drawback of this calculation was that the in - medium @xmath1-wave amplitudes for @xmath21 and related ( off - diagonal ) coupled channels were not accessible at finite temperature .    with the focus on the implementation of in - medium hadronic scattering amplitudes in microscopic transport simulations , we have improved our previous calculations in @xcite by adding the unitarization of the @xmath7 @xmath1-wave interaction and keeping the finite temperature formalism of @xcite for the scattering amplitudes and the meson self - energies .",
    "this improvement not only generalizes the results of @xcite to hot and dense matter , but additionally gives access to full off - shell in - medium scattering amplitudes in the @xmath20 set of coupled channels .",

    "first , in vacuum the incident kaon momentum in the lab frame determines the total energy and momentum of the @xmath289 pair and thus the center - of - mass energy , @xmath50 .",
    "then the evaluation of the scattering amplitude is straightforward since it only depends on @xmath0 ( in general on the invariants @xmath0 , @xmath300 and @xmath301 ) in vacuum .",
    "however , in the nuclear medium , the lorentz covariance is broken and the ( off - shell ) scattering amplitudes depend explicitly on @xmath277 and @xmath135 . in the nuclear matter rest frame and neglecting the fermi motion of the initial nucleon one has @xmath302 and @xmath303 , where @xmath304 is the off - shell energy of the incoming antikaon . since there is not a unique relation between @xmath304 and @xmath94 the probability for this reaction to occur",
    "should be folded with the spectral function of the antikaon .",
    "otherwise the information about the in - medium properties of the strange mesons , encoded in the meson self - energies , is not taken into account .",
    "note , for instance , that the @xmath8 is attracted by -@xmath305  mev at @xmath218 and therefore the total energy of the @xmath7 pair at a given lab momentum is lower than within the free on - shell prescription ( @xmath306 ) , thus giving access to the energy region below the nominal @xmath7 threshold in vacuum .",
    "an educated estimation of these effects on the effective cross section for @xmath7 scattering in the nuclear medium can be addressed as follows .",
    "an incident antikaon with momentum @xmath94 in the nuclear matter rest frame will have an energy distribution which we can approximate by the narrow quasi - particle energy , @xmath307 with @xmath308 the @xmath8 nuclear optical potential and @xmath309 ( the former provides a good approximation to the exact dispersion relation for the present purpose ) .",
    "then the total energy and momentum of the meson - baryon pair is given by @xmath310 where the nucleon energy is also modified by the corresponding scalar ( @xmath311 ) and vector ( @xmath312 ) mean field potentials ( @xmath313 contains the scalar part , @xmath314 ) , and where we have assumed for simplicity that the initial nucleon is at rest .",
    "it is clear from the equations above that the effective squared invariant energy @xmath315 is lower than its value in vacuum due to the attractive potentials acting on both the @xmath8 and the nucleon .",
    "of course in the nuclear matter rest frame the initial nucleon is not at rest but vibrates with fermi motion . in order to estimate the effect of the fermi motion of the initial nucleon we obtain the angular average over the nucleon distribution , which amounts to modifying eq .",

    "[ fig : cross - sec - med - effects ] for the @xmath57 elastic and @xmath299 reactions at normal nuclear matter density and zero temperature . in these particular channels",
    "the binding on the initial and final states is the same and thus the modification of the kinematical factors in the cross section simply reflects the reduction of @xmath321 with respect to the vacuum case , which induces a moderate increase in the cross section ( cf .",
    "compare curves labelled with `` on - shell prescription `` and `` in - medium flux only '' , where in the latter only the kinematical factors @xmath322 are modified ) .",
    "when the amplitudes are evaluated at total energy and momentum accounting for the nuclear potentials , cf .",
    "( [ eq : p0pmed ] ) and curves labelled with ' ' in - med flux+energy `` , we find that the strength is substantially redistributed to higher lab momenta .",
    "this results from the fact that , due to the nuclear binding in the initial state , the energy required to excite the @xmath3 can only be reached at a finite momentum of the incident antikaon .",
    "finally , the fermi motion of the initial nucleon ( cf .  curves ' ' in - med flux+energy+fermi '' ) only enhances moderately the cross section at small incident momentum in the elastic channel , whereas for @xmath323 the threshold is shifted to lower energies and this channel is open even below the @xmath324 vacuum threshold ( with relative momentum of the meson - baryon pair in the c.m .",

    "the isoscalar , @xmath0-wave @xmath7 amplitude is dominated by the excitation of the @xmath3 right below threshold , which acquires its physical width dominantly from the decay into @xmath169 states . when the nuclear medium is switched on , the resonance is practically washed out and its strength spread out over energy , as a consequence of the in - medium decay mechanisms incorporated through the self - consistent dressing of mesons ( e.g. @xmath325 ) .",
    "the @xmath1-wave amplitude reflects the excitation of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 hyperons ( in isospin 0 and 1 , respectively ) in the spin @xmath92 channel , and the @xmath19 with spin @xmath326 . at finite nuclear densities both the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 experience an attractive potential of roughly -50 and -40  mev at normal matter density and zero temperature , consistently with the input mean - field of the @xmath327 model employed to account for medium effects in the baryon propagators of intermediate meson - baryon states .",
    "both hyperons acquire a finite decay width , reflecting the probability to be absorbed by the nuclear medium or have quasi - elastic scattering processes at finite density and temperature .",
    "the @xmath86 develops a much smaller attractive potential of about -10  mev at @xmath218 and zero temperature which turns even to a small repulsion for increasing densities .",
    "its decay width is notably enhanced by a factor three at normal density mostly due to the dressing of pions , which opens new absorption channels such as @xmath328 and similarly with the pion coupling to @xmath206 excitations .",
    "the effect of the temperature in this case is moderate due to the important phase space already available at zero temperature .",
