    "the influence of strong external magnetic fields on the structure of the qcd phase diagram is a very important field of research due to its consequences on several physical phenomena : the measurements in heavy ion collisions at very high energies , the behavior of the first stages of the universe and the understanding of compact astrophysical objects like magnetars .    the inclusion of a magnetic field in the lagrangian density of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model and of the polyakov  nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model gives rise to the magnetic catalysis ( mc ) effect , i.e. , the enhancement of the quark condensate due to the magnetic field @xcite , but fails to account for the inverse magnetic catalysis ( imc ) found in lqcd calculations @xcite where the suppression of the quark condensate takes place due to the strong screening effect of the gluon interactions . in order to overcome this discrepancy ,",
    "it was proposed , by using the su(2 ) njl model @xcite and the su(3 ) njl / pnjl models @xcite , that the model coupling , @xmath0 , can be seen as proportional to the running coupling , @xmath1 , and consequently , a decreasing function of the magnetic field strength allowing to include the impact of @xmath2 in both models .",
    "indeed , the strong screening effect of the gluon interactions in the region of low momenta weakens the interaction which is reflected into a decrease of the scalar coupling with the intensity of the magnetic field @xcite .    since there is no lqcd data available for @xmath2 , by using the njl model we can fit @xmath3 in order to reproduce the pseudocritical chiral transition temperatures , @xmath4 , obtained in lqcd calculations @xcite . the resulting fit function that reproduces the @xmath4 is @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and where @xmath10 .",
    "we also have used @xmath11 mev .    in the njl model , the renormalized pseudocritical chiral transition temperatures , @xmath12 ,",
    "are plotted in left panel of fig .",

    "( [ eq : fit ] ) , we calculate the chiral and deconfinement transitions temperatures as a function of @xmath13 in the pnjl model .",
    "the results are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_crit ] : due to the existing coupling between the polyakov loop field and quarks within the pnjl model , the @xmath3 does not only affect the chiral transition but also the deconfinement transition .",
    "consequently , both temperatures transitions decrease with increasing magnetic filed strength .",
    "the nature of the phase transition and the existence of the critical end point ( cep ) are open issues for theoretical studies about the qcd phase diagram @xcite . from the experimental point of view",
    "the existence / location of the cep is also a very timely topic .",
    "this renders important to know the conditions that can change the position of the cep in the phase diagram , namely the presence of strong magnetic fields .    in the following ,",
    "we will study two scenarios for the effect of a static external magnetic field on the location of the cep when symmetric matter ( @xmath18 ) is considered : + case i @xmath19 where we take the usual @xmath14 and no imc effects are included ; + case ii @xmath19 where we will use @xmath3 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) which will allow us to consider the imc effects on the qcd phase diagram .    the results for case i are plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ cep ] and reproduce qualitatively the results previously obtained within the njl model in @xcite : as the intensity of the magnetic field increases , the transition temperature increases and the baryonic chemical potential decreases until the critical value @xmath20 gev@xmath21 . for stronger magnetic fields both @xmath22 and @xmath23 increase . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cep ] the cep is given in a @xmath22 versus baryonic density plot .",
    "it is seen that when @xmath13 increases from 0 to 1 gev@xmath21 the baryonic density at the cep increases from 2@xmath24 to @xmath25 @xcite .      with respect to case ii",
    "the results for the cep are presented in fig .",
    "[ cep_imc ] , red points .",
    "we clearly observe a different behavior when compared with case i ( black points ) : at @xmath26 both cep s coincide but , already for small values of @xmath27 , the cep is moved to lower temperatures and chemical potentials .",
    "nevertheless , until @xmath28 gev@xmath21 the pattern is similar for both cases .",
    "however , for stronger magnetic fields the position of the cep in case ii oscillates between @xmath29 and @xmath30 mev while the chemical potential takes increasingly smaller values : a completely different behavior when compared with case i , where both values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the cep increase .",
    "the reason of this behavior lies in fact that the restoration of chiral symmetry is stressed by the decreasing of the coupling @xmath3 .",
    "the increasing of the magnetic filed is not sufficient to counteract this effect as can be seen if fig .",
    "[ cep_mass ] , where we plot the quarks masses ( @xmath31-black line ; @xmath32-red line ; @xmath33-blue line ) as function of @xmath23 for the respective temperature where the cep occurs ( @xmath34 ) at @xmath35 and @xmath36 gev@xmath21 . at @xmath35 gev@xmath21 ( left panel )",
    "@xmath0 is barely affected by the magnetic field , the values of the quark masses are very close to each other for both cases , and the cep occurs at smaller temperatures and at close , but smaller , chemical potentials . when @xmath36 gev@xmath21 , the quark masses in case i are increased with respect to the @xmath26 case ( due to mc effect ) , being the restoration of chiral symmetry more difficult to achieve . however , when @xmath3 , case ii , the masses of the quarks are already smaller than the @xmath26 case ( due to imc effect ) leading to an faster restoration of chiral symmetry at small temperatures and chemical potentials .",
    "eventually , with the increase of @xmath27 , the cep would disappear in the temperature axis and the transition to the chiral restored phase is always of first order .",
