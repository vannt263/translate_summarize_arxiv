    "studies of large samples of distant galaxies are fundamental to provide a deeper insight in the formation and evolution of galaxies and systems of galaxies , such as clusters and groups .",
    "using measurements of galaxy clustering at @xmath13 one can test the predictions of cosmological models of structure formation and evolution @xcite . in the last years",
    "diverse photometric selection techniques have been developed in order to select high redshift galaxies .",
    "in particular the lyman break technique is an ideal method for selecting a large number of distant galaxies and for studying the large - scale distribution and properties of star - forming systems at high redshifts from multicolour optical data @xcite .",
    "this technique requires a high rest - frame far ultraviolet luminosity , and so will preferentially select galaxies with recent or unobscured active star - formation @xcite .",
    "a new near - infrared selection technique has been developed in recent years to select samples of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the distant red galaxies ( drgs , hereafter ) colour  cut criterion ( @xmath0 , vega system ) @xcite is expected to select galaxies with prominent rest frame optical breaks , caused by the 3625    balmer - break or the 4000   ca ii h+k break . the balmer discontinuity at 3625    is strongest in a - type stars and the 4000    break is characteristic of coolers stars with types later than g0 and strong in giant and supergiant stars @xcite .",
    "van dokkum et al . (",
    "2003 ) found that the drg criterion selects galaxies with rest - frame optical colours similar to those of normal nearby galaxies . using deep mid - infrared observations with irac on the spitzer space telescope",
    ", @xcite found that 70% of the drgs are best described by dust - reddened star forming models and 30% are very well fit with old stellar population , passive star evolution galaxy models .",
    "by comparison of the stellar populations of dgrs to those obtain in lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) , @xcite found that the average mass - to light ratios ( @xmath14 ) of the drgs are about three times higher than the lbgs sample , indicating that dgrs may represent massive and old galaxies , similar to those found in the local universe .",
    "a similar study by @xcite comparing lbgs and drgs at similar redshifts and rest - frame @xmath15-band luminosities , shows that drgs are older , more massive and more obscured for any given star formation history than lbgs .",
    "recent works by @xcite and @xcite show that this single near ir colour  cut selects a rather heterogeneous sample of galaxies , from distant luminous massive systems , to a significant fraction of less luminous dusty star - burst and galaxies with mixed morphology at redshifts @xmath16 , with extended tails at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    at low redshifts ,",
    "qso environments show similar characteristics of those found in normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that the cross - correlation function between low ( @xmath19 ) qsos and galaxies , is consistent with the auto - correlation function of galaxies selected from the apm galaxy survey .",
    "unlike radio - loud qsos , @xcite found that radio - quiet qsos at @xmath20 are rarely found in high density environments as rich as abell class 1 .",
    "recently , @xcite studying the environment of @xmath21 luminous ( @xmath2222 ) quasars in the sdss area , found that they are located in higher local overdensity regions than are typical @xmath23 galaxies .",
    "however , the results for qso environment at higher redshifts ( @xmath1 ) are contradictory .",
    "@xcite found that some of the @xmath24 qsos are located in environments as rich as those of abell class 1 clusters .",
    "@xcite reported a significant excess of faint galaxies in the fields of @xmath25 quasars .",
    "no excess galaxy population associated with radio - quiet qsos are reported by @xcite at @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite found an anti - correlation between radio - quiet qsos and galaxies at redshifts @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite studied the clustering of galaxies around a sample of @xmath28 qsos selected from the sdss and deep2 surveys .",
    "they found , from a two - point cross - correlation analysis , that the local environment of qsos is consistent with the mean environment of the full deep2 galaxy population and that they cluster similar to the blue , star - forming galaxies rather than the red galaxies .",
    "their results imply that high redshift qsos do not reside in particularly massive dark matter halos .    using the drgs criterion , @xcite reported a discovery of proto - clusters candidates around 6 high redshifts radio galaxies at @xmath29 on the basis of excess of @xmath30 colour  selected galaxies .",
    "recently , a similar colour criterion was adopted to identify and to study the environment of very distant objects .",
    "this method uses a colour cut @xmath31 which select objects at @xmath32 .",
    "an over - density of galaxies around the most distant radio  loud qso ( sdss j0836 + 0054 at @xmath33 ) was reported by @xcite , who found a surface density six times higher than the number expected from deep fields at similar redshifts .",
    "@xcite found an excess of @xmath31 galaxies around one of the most distant qsos at @xmath34 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the population and colour distribution of drgs , selected at bright near  ir magnitudes ( @xmath35 , vega system ) around high redshift qsos ( @xmath1 ) and optical obscured sources ( @xmath36 ) in the flamingos extragalactic survey ( flamex , @xcite ) .",

    "we study the colour distribution of galaxies in different environments .",
    "we investigate the qso  drgs and obscured  drgs cross - correlation analysis in section 5 .",
    "finally we discuss our results in section 6 .    in this work",
    "we assume a standard @xmath37cdm model universe with cosmological parameters , @xmath38=0.3 , @xmath39=0.7 and a hubble constant of @xmath40100 km  s@xmath8mpc@xmath8 .",

    "the flamingos extragalactic survey ( flamex , @xcite ) is a wide - area , near - infrared imaging survey in @xmath41 and @xmath42 bands within the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) regions @xcite .",
    "this paper uses catalogues of the first data release dr1 of the northern part of the survey ( botes field ) that covers 4.7 deg@xmath5 in both @xmath41 and @xmath42 bands . using monte carlo simulations @xcite found that more than 90 % of the survey region is complete to @xmath43 19.2 , with 50 % being complete to @xmath44 .",
    "a detailed description of the observing strategy and data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "the catalogues were made using @xmath42selected objects for each survey subset with the sextractor package @xcite , using dual image mode to measure the @xmath41band magnitudes within the same regions .",
    "detections in the different bands were matched if the centroids were within 1 @xmath45 of each other .",
    "@xmath30 colours were calculated using 4@xmath45 diameter aperture photometry , sufficiently large to avoid intrinsic aberrations that cause the psf to vary significantly across the field and to produce robust photometry across entire subfields .    in order to reject spurious objects lying in the edges of the images , we selected objects that not overlap with another object using the sextractor parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath48 0.7 , in both @xmath41 and @xmath42 bands .    for two different reasons , no star - galaxy separation was performed .",
    "first , the variable psf in the flamex area precluded use of structural information to separate stars from extended sources and second , drgs are of such small apparent size that considerable fraction of them would possibly be misclassified as stars and rejected from the final catalogues .",
    "as noted by @xcite , and as can be seen in the colour - magnitude diagram ( figure 1 ) , the @xmath30 colours alone provides a simple means of performing star - galaxy separation .",
    "the two horizontal sequences at @xmath30=0.4 and @xmath30=0.8 correspond to galactic stars with types later than g5 and earlier than k5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "red galaxies with @xmath492.3 are well separated from stars .",

    "ray selected agn @xcite ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we also choose a sample of optically obscured galaxies discovered with the spitzer space telescope , which are either optically very faint ( @xmath5024.5 ) or invisible ( @xmath5026 ) with no counterparts in the noao deep wide - field survey regions .",
    "the main goal of this survey is to select optically very faint galaxies but bright enough in the mid - infrared for redshift determination with the infrared spectrograph on spitzer ( irs ) , which would not have been identified in previous optical studies .",
    "sources with @xmath2 mag were identified with the multi - band imaging photometer ( mips ) on the spitzer space telescope to a limiting 24 @xmath3 m flux density above 0.75 mjy .",
    "114 sources of the total sample met this optical criterion .",
    "out of these , 17 sources have no optical or have very faint optical counterparts . rejecting sources lying in the edges of the images , where noise level are high and signal to noise values are low",
    ", we finally selected 6 sources located within the flamex area , with a mean redshift distribution @xmath36 .",
    "the redshift range of the selected sources are similar to that of the redshift distribution of drgs with @xmath51 ( vega magnitudes ) found by @xcite .",
    "redshifts from this sample were derived primarily from strong silicate absorption features @xcite .",
    "we also selected another two sources with feasible redshift determinations derived by a weak silicate absorption feature , based on fits of redshifted spectral templates of local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) from @xcite .",
    "full details of the sample selection and redshift determination is given in @xcite .",
    "as noted by @xcite template fits suggest that most of the optically obscured sources are dominated by an agn component , i.e. a steeply rising spectra and varying levels of silicate absorption , similar to the infrared spectra of known local agns . by comparing bolometric luminosities of submillimeter selected galaxies , such as those detected in scuba or mambo suryeys , @xcite found that the obscured source sample seems to represent sources that have a hotter dust component than typical submillimeter - selected galaxies , assuming that mid - infrared luminosities scale to bolometric luminosities similar than in template sources which fit the mid - infrared spectra . using this scaling ,",
