    "understanding the processes by which molecules and particles on surfaces absorb and scatter electromagnetic radiation is an area of considerable scientific importance .",
    "information may be needed because of an intrinsic desire to study surface physics , because an active surface forms part of an electronic device , or because of the need to locate defects and identify contaminants .",
    "examples include the dynamics of adsorbed biomolecules @xcite , the adhesion and movement of droplets @xcite , the plasmonic behaviour of nanoparticles @xcite , and the photonic response of patterned films @xcite .",
    "surface processes have traditionally been studied through infrared and optical microscopy , spectroscopy , and scattering , with afm playing a key role in recent years .    often , the information needed has to be acquired indirectly through measurements made at inappropriate wavelengths , or through models that are hard to extrapolate .",
    "crucially , it is necessary to measure the state of coherence of the field to which a system is sensitive in order to fully characterize its behaviour : for example when calculating radiative heat transfer between nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "measurements made with a single source only gain access to a subset of the information available . of particular importance",
    "are those cases where the ability of a surface to absorb energy is central to the operation of a device . for example",
    ", complex schemes are being explored to increase the efficiency of photovoltaics @xcite , to optimize the sensitivity of infrared and optical sensors @xcite , and to develop frequency selective surfaces , high - power mirrors , and hyperspectral black absorbers . in all cases ,",
    "the physics of the absorption process is intimately related to the existence of coherent phenomena such as resonant dipole interactions , surface plasmon coupling @xcite , and surface phonon exchange . even in the case of apparently simple structures , such as planar dielectric and metallic interfaces ,",
    "the near - field spatial and polarimetric correlations contain a wealth of information @xcite .",
    "a typical set of questions is as follows : what are the scale sizes and forms of the dynamical modes responsible for absorbing energy ?",
    "how many modes are involved in the absorption process ?",
    "what are their responsivities ? what physical mechanisms mediate the collective behaviour ? in this paper",
    "we argue that it is possible to measure the state of coherence of the electromagnetic field to which any system is sensitive , and thereby determine the spatial forms , polarizations , and relative strengths of the individual modes responsible for absorbing energy . because the electromagnetic modes are intimately related to dynamical modes of the system , it is possible to accrue direct information about the dynamical modes themselves , and thereby reveal the existence of collective phenomena .",
    "the basic technique can be used at any wavelength , and can be implemented in a number of different ways .",
    "the basic idea is to illuminate the structure under test ( sut ) with a pair of phase - locked , near - field or far - field point sources .",
    "as the differential phase between the sources is rotated , the _ total _ absorbed power displays a fringe .",
    "if the complex visibility of this fringe is measured for different pairs of source locations , the dynamical forms of the modes responsible for absorbing the energy can be found . in the case of detectors and photovoltaics",
    ", the scheme is particularly easy to implement because the degrees of freedom responsible for generating the measured output are those of practical significance .",
    "although the technique is applicable to a wide range of problems , we illustrate the method by showing how it provides information about the collective behaviour of systems of surface dipoles .",
    "the sut is modeled by using the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) @xcite , together with a polarizability that allows for bound states and damping to the substrate .",
    "dda was originally devised @xcite to model light extinction by astrophysical particles , but has since been developed in areas as diverse as modeling the aggregation of irregular particles from colloids @xcite , the scattering of light by particles on surfaces @xcite , the scattering of light by periodic targets @xcite , and the optical properties of viruses , proteins , dna , and blood cells @xcite . formulating our measurement procedure in terms of dda opens the way to predicting the interferometric response of a wide variety of complex objects such as biomolecules , droplets , and nanoparticles , and thereby creating representative dynamical models of measured interferometric data .",
    "other simulation methods , such as mom , can be used .    as an aside , a variant of eai can be used with dda purely as a numerical tool for determining the state of coherence , and therefore the incident electromagnetic modes , to which any irregular dielectric body is sensitive .",
    "the scheme differs from the usual method for determining the state of coherence of thermally radiated fields , through @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the electric green s dyadic of the whole system including scattering , because ( [ a ] ) requires the object to be in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings , and therefore includes the blackbody environment and scattered fields . as a consequence , even lossless dielectric objects display near - field coherence effects , as discussed by yannopapas in the context of chains of spheres @xcite .",
    "in contrast , eai only includes those degrees of freedom responsible for absorbing energy .",
    "in section  [ sec : basic_scheme ] we present the theory of energy absorption interferometry ( eai ) , and then in section  [ sec : simulations ] illustrate how it can be used to recover the dynamical modes of ring - like and linear chains of coupled dipoles , with and without defects .",
    "linear chains of dipoles @xcite , spheres @xcite , and cylinders @xcite are of practical importance , and exhibit complex forms of spatial and spectral coherence .",
    "we show how eai can reveal large - scale collective behaviour , and how the response of a discrete system transitions to that of a continuous system when the sut contains many dipoles per wavelength . in section",

    "the visibility plots shown in the middle pane of fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] reveal the existence of this large - scale collective behaviour .",
    "the bottom pane of fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] shows the visibility at 500  ghz , where no obvious spectral features are present .",
    "the two largest eigenmodes are degenerate , each corresponding to a high amplitude end wave that travels towards the centre : only one of them is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] ( solid ) .",
    "crucially , however , the effects at opposite ends are not coupled , as they are at 205  ghz .",
    "this behaviour is apparent in the visibility plots . near the centre",
    ", the system behaves as an almost incoherent absorber , whereas at the ends , highly coherent absorption is seen .",
    "the absorption process at one end is incoherent with respect to the absorption process at the other .",
    "compare the bottom pane of fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] with the middle and top panes .",
    "the various forms seen are typical of thin - film planar absorbers , and therefore the linear chain is becoming large enough to take on the characteristics of a continuous absorber , and macroscopic multipolar expansions can be used to describe behaviour @xcite .",
    "many other simulations were performed during the course of the work .",
    "for example , we looked at arrangements where a single , lightly coupled dipole was placed next to a ring - like or linear chain , and found that we were able to separate out the behaviour of the lightly bound dipole from the collective behaviour of the chain .",
    "also , we could identify the existence of ` grain - boundary - like ' defects on long chains .",
    "although this paper focuses on the theory of eai , it beneficial to comment on its practical application .",
    "the central requirements are ( i ) the ability to phase - lock two sources , ( ii ) the ability to scan the sources within a near - field or far - field volume , ( iii ) the ability to measure the total power absorbed , or at least the part of it that constitutes the operation of the device .",
    "because the key elements are so simple , the scheme can be used at any wavelength .",
    "crucially , high - power sources can be used , perhaps at low temperatures , extending the method well beyond anything that can be achieved by measuring the correlations in thermally radiated fields @xcite .",
    "it is certainly straightforward to assemble phased - locked sources for radio , infrared , and optical wavelengths .",
    "in fact , we have already demonstrated that it is possible to measure the state of coherence of the reception patterns of multimode power detectors over the range 195 - 270  ghz using absorbed power only @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the frequencies of the two sources were offset slightly to produce a time varying output that contained the fringe information in real time . in some cases ,",
    "a single - frequency source would be used , say in the case of a laser and power splitter , and then @xmath171 path - length switching would be needed to determine the quadrature components of the fringe .",
    "there are many ways in which the sut could be illuminated with different basis sets to span the dynamical modes of interest .",
    "for example , far - field probes in the form of optical fibres , or near - field probes in the form of coaxial afm - like tips , could be scanned across or rotated around the sut . in magnetic measurements ,",
    "coils could be swept around and scanned across the surface of interest . in general ,",
    "polarisation switching is needed , but this can be done in a straightforward manner . a crucial question is ` how many samples must be taken to gain access to the degrees of freedom of interest ? ' we have already identified efficient real - time techniques for adding in more and more sample points until convergence is reached , and the significant degrees of freedom identified .",
    "eai is , in general terms , quite similar to aperture synthesis interferometry , used extensively in astronomy , and many of the data processing techniques developed for astronomical imaging , such as closure phase , could be incorporated here .",
    "the final requirement is a way of determining the total power absorbed . in many applications , such as photovoltaics and optical sensors ,",
    "the output of the device is already a direct measure of the power being absorbed through the degrees of freedom of interest . in these cases",
    ", one might not even be interested in the surface physics per se , but a detailed characterisation of the nature , number , and responsivities of the electromagnetic modes to which the device is sensitive .",
    "additionally , representative models based on dda can be used to understand how the electromagnetic modes relate to the dynamical behaviour of the absorbing surface . in some cases , such as patterned films or biomolecules on surfaces , a way of monitoring the total power absorbed",
    "is required .",
    "our own preferred approach is to attach the sut to a micromachined sin membrane , which also supports a thin - film temperature sensor .",
    "such devices have been developed extensively for astronomical detectors , and when used at low temperatures can achieve extreme sensitivity @xcite .",
    "our detectors @xcite can detect absorbed powers of much less than 1  fw with noise levels of 1x10@xmath172  whz@xmath173 , making extreme thermometry of thin - film structures entirely possible .",
    "we have shown that by illuminating an energy - absorbing surface or structure with a pair of phase - locked sources , it is possible to measure the state of coherence of the electromagnetic field to which the structure is sensitive . the tensor that describes the coherence can be diagonalized to find the amplitude , phase , and polarization patterns of the individual electromagnetic modes through which the structure can absorb power . in some cases , such as photovoltaics and detectors ,",
    "this information is already sufficient to understand and characterize behaviour .",
    "it is also possible , however , to map the electromagnetic modes back onto the surface , or object , to gain representations of the dynamical modes responsible for absorption .",
    "these modes are intimately related to the existence of coherent phenomena , such as elastic waves and surface plasmons . in a continuous formulation of the method ,",
    "not yet published , we have shown that it is possible to detect the presence of subsurface voids .",
    "the method can be implemented easily , and because high - power sources are used , can far outperform any experiment that relies on measuring the correlations in themally radiated fields .",
    "more speculatively , the use of high power sources , together with a space - frequency formulation , may open the way to studying non - linear surface effects .",
    "this work was carried out while prof .",
    "withington was a visiting fellow at all souls college , oxford .",
    "withington would like to thank the warden and fellows for their generosity and hospitality during his stay ."
