    "a major unresolved aspect of ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) physics  @xcite is their composition and above which energy the flux is dominated by extragalactic sources . above @xmath5ev the chemical composition is basically unknown  @xcite . around @xmath2ev",
    "the situation is particularly inconclusive as hires  @xcite and hires - mia  @xcite data suggest a light ( proton dominated ) composition , whereas other experiments indicate a heavy composition  @xcite .    as a consequence , there are currently two different scenarios : the `` standard '' one , where a transition from a steeper , galactic heavy component to a flatter , extragalactic component dominated by protons takes place at the ankle at @xmath6ev , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , and a more recent one suggesting that this transition actually takes place at lower energies , namely around the `` second knee '' at @xmath7ev .",
    "this second scenario in which extragalactic protons dominate down to the second knee has the following consequences : first , since the observed spectrum above the second knee is quite steep , @xmath8 , the extragalactic proton flux has to cut off below @xmath7ev .",
    "this can be explained as a magnetic horizon effect : protons from cosmological distances can not reach the observer any more within a hubble time due to diffusion in large scale magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "second , the ankle would have to be interpreted as due to pair production of the extragalactic protons  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been pointed out recently  @xcite , that this model can not afford injection of a significant heavy component above the ankle whose secondary photo - disintegration products in the form of intermediate mass nuclei would produce a bump around the ankle .",
    "injection of a mixed composition would also require a harder injection spectrum @xmath9 with @xmath10 , as opposed to the extragalactic ankle scenario with pure protons  @xcite which requires an injection spectrum @xmath11 .",
    "in the proton dominated low - cross over scenario the resulting spectra are surprisingly insensitive to details such as extra - galactic magnetic fields ( egmf ) and actual source distribution , as long as the distances between uhecr sources are much smaller than the energy loss and diffusion lengths  @xcite .",
    "the spectra are then equal to the spectra resulting from a homogeneous source distribution which is therefore called `` universal '' .",
    "continuously distributed sources fulfill this condition .",
    "actual uhecr sources are , however , likely discrete with a relatively small density of order @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "these values are motivated by the density of candidate sources such as active galaxies and also by hints of uhecr clusters .",
    "in addition , there likely is a strongly structured egmf . in the present paper",
    "we study how a strongly structured universe can cause deviations from the universal spectra in the case where extragalactic protons dominate the observed flux down to @xmath12ev .",
    "we also include in this study secondary neutrinos and @xmath13rays , produced by interactions of the primary nucleons with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the infrared ( ir ) background .",
    "the relevant reactions which also govern energy loss of the primary nucleons are pion production above the `` gzk threshold ''  @xcite and , for @xmath13rays , by pair production of protons .",
    "there is a strong motivation to study predictions for the fraction of @xmath13rays in the uhecr flux from recent experimental upper limits  @xcite that will further improve in the near future , especially from the pierre auger project  @xcite .",
    "even secondary neutrino fluxes may be detectable in the not too far future  @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we describe our simulations , in section 3 we discuss results for various degrees of structure in the source distribution and magnetic field scenarios . in section 4",
    "we discuss uncertainties in the @xmath13ray to charged primary flux ratio predicted in bottom - up scenarios and we conclude in section 4 .",
    "we use natural units , @xmath14 , throughout the paper .",
    "for the trajectory simulations we use the public code package crpropa  @xcite .",
    "it follows nucleon trajectories in 3 dimensions in arbitrarily structured environments and takes into account secondary neutrinos and electromagnetic ( em ) cascades produced by nucleon interactions with the cmb and ir backgrounds .",
    "note that trajectory simulations allow to treat both the rectilinear and diffusive regime without approximation and are thus more general than using the diffusion approximation as adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite which in addition was restricted to a homogeneous egmf .",
    "we will also compare the general case to the isotropic situation in the absence of uhecr deflection and source structure which can be simulated with the one - dimensional version of crpropa in which primary and secondary particles just propagate along straight lines .",
    "this case has been considered , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we inject protons with a spectrum @xmath15 up to @xmath16ev and adjust the injection index @xmath17 to the data .",
    "we also consider scenarios where the injection power per comoving volume evolves as a power law @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is often called the `` bright phase index '' .",
    "we integrate up to redshift @xmath20 .    for nucleons",
    "we take into account photo - pion production , and pair production on the cmb and ir background , as well as redshift , and deflection in the cases where we consider an egmf .    the @xmath13ray interaction length above @xmath21ev strongly depends on the density of the universal radio background ( urb )  @xcite .",
    "we use the minimal estimate for the urb  @xcite . for the ir background we use the model of primack",
    "the ir background is mostly relevant for pion production for relatively steep proton injection spectra , and for photon attenuation in the tev regime .",
    "since we are mostly interested in energies above @xmath0ev , for our purposes the ir background is less relevant for em cascade propagation . between @xmath0ev and @xmath22ev ,",
    "the @xmath13ray attenuation length is smaller than 10 mpc , and thus redshift effects are negligible at these energies .",
    "furthermore , since we are interested in diffuse fluxes , we can treat the em cascades as 1-dimensional .",
    "neutrinos propagate along straight lines and , once produced , are only subject to redshift",

    "[ fig4 ] is also quite insensitive to both the continuous source distribution and the egmf .",

    "@xcite .    in the following",
    "we define the photon to cosmic ray flux ratio as relative to the total observed cosmic ray flux below @xmath42ev and relative to the simulated nucleon flux above @xmath42ev .",
    "this photon to cosmic ray flux ratio , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , in fact broadly follows the attenuation length of the em cascade  @xcite .",
    "this is to be expected as long as the primary flux does not exhibit a strong break between the energy @xmath43 at which the secondary to primary ratio is considered and the energies @xmath44 of the primaries mostly responsible for the secondary flux at energy @xmath43 .",

    "[ fig3 ] shows that the structured egmf reaches values of @xmath56 g over several mpc around the sources in the lss simulation used here .",
    "below @xmath57ev , the diffusion length then also becomes smaller than the average source distance @xmath58 this leads to a suppression of the nucleon flux due to a partial confinement of uhecrs which was discussed qualitatively in ref .",

    "we also found that the diffuse cosmogenic neutrino flux depends mostly on the source evolution , but little on the source distribution or egmf .",
    "this is understandable because the neutrino energy attenuation length is basically the hubble radius and thus always larger than all other scales involved .",
    "sources up to cosmological distances thus contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux .",
    "since neutrinos are produced by pionproduction of nucleons off the cmb and ir backgrounds , for a given uhecr injection spectrum , the fraction of the uhecr energy transformed to neutrinos should , therefore , be rather independent of source distribution or egmf .",

    "we recall in this context that the cosmogenic neutrino flux is also believed to considerably depend on primary cosmic ray composition  @xcite .    on the other hand , additional photons",

    "iii above , since in this energy range , the em cascade attenuation length is smaller than or comparable to the typical source distance , the photon fraction depends mostly on em secondary production outside the sources .",
    "second , the primary cosmic ray flux is not expected to be significantly modified by these processes , since only about 1% of its energy is expected to be converted by interactions with an enhanced ir background within galaxy clusters  @xcite , and since the optical depth for @xmath79 interactions is less than unity in galaxy clusters  @xcite .",
    "we have performed simulations following ultra - high energy nucleon trajectories above @xmath68ev and compared scenarios with continuous and discrete source distributions as well as the case of negligible and highly structured extragalactic magnetic fields reaching microgauss levels in galaxy clusters .",
    "powerful ultra - high energy cosmic ray sources likely have densities of order @xmath80 .",
    "we find two considerably non - universal effects that depend on source distributions and magnetic fields : we found that the primary extra - galactic cosmic ray flux can become strongly suppressed below a few @xmath2ev if the sources are immersed in highly structured magnetic fields .",
    "this is due to the fact that cosmic ray primaries start to be magnetically confined and do not reach the observer any more at these energies .",
    "this effect can indeed be considerably stronger than for stochastic magnetic fields with homogeneous properties and r.m.s . strength @xmath81",
    "we also found that the secondary photon to primary cosmic ray flux ratio between @xmath3ev and @xmath4ev is of the order @xmath46 and decreases with decreasing source density and increasing magnetization . in principle at least , this ratio could therefore serve as an independent measure of these poorly known quantities .",
    "in contrast , the photon to cosmic ray flux ratio is rather insensitive to source distributions and magnetic fields at lower energies as well as above @xmath4ev where it can reach the percent level .",
    "we also pointed out that a significant contribution of nuclei heavier than hydrogen to the primary cosmic ray flux tends to reduce the @xmath13ray to charged cosmic ray ratio further . also , additional photon production within the sources is unlikely to increase this ratio significantly . as a consequence , in acceleration scenarios for the origin of highest energy cosmic rays",
