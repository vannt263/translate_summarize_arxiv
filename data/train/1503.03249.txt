    "adiabatic process is aimed at stabilizing a parameter - varying quantum system at its eigenstate .",
    "this process has many applications in the engineering of quantum systems @xcite , and in particular plays the fundamental role in adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic theorem @xcite states that a system will undergo adiabatic evolution given that the system parameter varies slowly .",
    "quantifying the applicability of adiabatic approximations is an interesting topic of current research efforts . on the one hand",
    ", this kind of research has been spurred by so - called shortcuts to adiabaticity @xcite , and on the other hand recent insights from thermodynamics haven put adiabatic processes back into focus @xcite .",
    "in particular , the validity of the adiabatic theorem has been under intensive studies both theoretically and experimentally since it was proposed , and much of these efforts were devoted to the rigorous description of the sufficient quantitative conditions of adiabatic theorem , and the estimation of the error accumulated over a long time @xcite . once the exact knowledge on the adiabatic process is available , it is straightforward to apply the results to the optimal design of adiabatic control on specific systems @xcite .",
    "the most interesting progress is that the validity of the adiabatic theorem itself has been challenged in the recent decade @xcite , both by strict analysis and counter - examples . according to these findings",
    ", the errors induced by the adiabatic approximation could accumulate over time despite certain quantitative condition is satisfied @xcite , e.g. , when there exists an additional perturbation or driving that is resonant with the system . particularly as indicated in @xcite , it is not new that resonant driving can cause population transfer between eigenstates . also , a proof can be found in @xcite stating that only a resonant perturbation whose amplitude gradually decays to zero can result in a violation of a well - known sufficient condition .",
    "in this paper we consider the following process : the process starts at @xmath0 .",
    "the system hamiltonian at @xmath0 is @xmath1 , and the system hamiltonian at @xmath2 is @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "@xmath5 is a fixed operator and so the direction of the variation is fixed .",
    "we assume @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 are bounded operators throughout this paper .",
    "@xmath7 is the evolution time .",
    "the transition of the system from @xmath1 to @xmath6 can be described using an interpolating function @xmath8 so that @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we work under the condition that a valid perturbative analysis of the system evolution is available .",
    "this often means @xmath4 should be smaller than a threshold value .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the classical adiabatic theorem was proved also using a perturbative analysis , which can not be applied directly to a large variation of hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , our analysis in this paper is not concerned with the adiabatic evolution for a large variation of hamiltonian",
    ". however , our analysis provides a rigorous estimation of the error accumulated during this small - variation evolution for an arbitrarily given interpolation .",
    "our work is different from the previous works in two ways .",
    "first , instead of studying the evolution of the eigenstates and their corresponding probability amplitudes , the mean value of a hermitian operator is defined as a measure of the error .",
    "for example , in the context of adiabatic quantum computation where one wants to prepare the ground state of a target hamiltonian @xmath12 whose ground - state energy is @xmath13 , @xmath14 serves as a good measure of the distance between the real - time state @xmath15 and the ground state .",
    "this measure resembles the excitation energy or excess work performed during the process , as studied in thermodynamics @xcite . in this paper",
    "we only consider the error accumulated over the entire process , which means we are only interested in @xmath16 .",
    "the second difference is that the error , or the excitation energy or excess work performed during the process , can be estimated with a sufficient precision for arbitrarily given interpolating functions . as a result ,",
    "the parameters which are related to the suppression of the error can be easily identified .",
    "for example , we have @xmath17 as @xmath18 in the case of linear interpolation . here",
    "@xmath19 is the energy gap between the ground and first - excited states of the initial hamiltonian .",
    "however for the interpolation in the counterexample @xcite , the scaling of @xmath20 is not so simple .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ secdef ]",
    ", we introduce the model of this paper . in section [ seclinear ] ,",
    "we give the estimation of the error for linear interpolation . in section [ secnonlinear ] ,",
    "we present the general algorithm to estimate the error for an arbitrarily given interpolating function .",
    "we discuss three examples in section [ secexam ] .",
    "conclusion is given in section [ seccon ] .",
    "the system is defined on an @xmath21-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we set dirac constant @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 denotes the matrix norm .",
    "two real functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be denoted as @xmath26 if and only if there exists a positive real number @xmath27 and a real number @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the absolute value .",
    "let @xmath31 be the monotonically increasing sequence of eigenvalues of @xmath1 , so that @xmath32 when @xmath33 , and @xmath34 be the corresponding eigenstates .",
    "we denote the energy gap between the @xmath35th eigenstate and the ground state as @xmath36 . similarly , we define the increasing sequence of eigenvalues of @xmath6 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 correspondingly .    for convenience ,",
    "we also introduce two offset hamiltonians , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath39 is defined as @xmath41 , i.e. , by offsetting the hamiltonian of the system at @xmath0 by a constant operator @xmath42 so that @xmath43 .",
    "by @xmath43 we mean @xmath39 is positive semidefinite and its the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath39 is zero .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath44 by offsetting the system hamiltonian by a constant operator @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the system state at time @xmath46 and let @xmath47 be the initial state of the system at @xmath0 .",
    "we always assume that @xmath47 is the ground state of @xmath39 , and so we have @xmath48 .",
    "the measure of adiabaticity is proposed as follows    the distance between the final state and the ground state of @xmath6 is measured by @xmath49    obviously , if the evolution is adiabatic , i.e. , @xmath50 is the ground state of @xmath6 , then we have @xmath51 . in particular",
    ", @xmath20 is closely related to the fidelity of the final state and ground state in the schrdinger picture ( see appendix [ appendix3 ] ) . a small error",
    "@xmath20 implies a large fidelity .",
    "in this paper we also call @xmath20 the adiabatic approximation error , as @xmath20 reflects how well we can approximate the evolution as a perfect adiabatic process .    in this paper",
    "we only consider @xmath4 such that @xmath52 $ ] can be expanded using magnus series in the interaction picture . for more details about the expansion in the interaction picture",
    ", please refer to appendix [ appendix1 ] .",
    "if the series expansion is valid in the interaction picture , we can transform back to the schrdinger picture and write the evolution of the state as ( see appendix [ appendix1 ] ) @xmath53)e^{\\mbox{i}h_1t},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have @xmath54 . a sufficient condition for the magnus series to converge is given by ( see appendix [ appendix1 ] ) @xmath55    our aim is to estimate an asymptotic behaviour of @xmath20 provided @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , we will use the obtained estimate to analyze several cases of the adiabatic theorem including those where some difficulties with adiabatic approximation have been encountered .",

    "the approach derived in the previous section can be easily generalized for arbitrary given continuous interpolating functions .",
    "the generalization can simply be done by replacing the linear interpolation function with the given continuous function @xmath8 and then recalculating the double integration @xmath95 in ( [ ft ] ) .",
