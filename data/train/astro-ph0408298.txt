    "the unusual star vy canis majoris ( vy cma ) , is located at the edge of the very large ( @xmath2 5@xmath5 in diameter ) sharpless 310 hii region at a distance of 1.5 kpc ( e.g. @xcite ) , and is one of the most intrinsically luminous stars known in the galaxy with @xmath6 ( e.g. @xcite ) . despite its high luminosity , it has a low effective temperature of @xmath7 , making it a red supergiant of spectral class m5ib with a mass of @xmath2 25 m@xmath8 .",
    "its unusually high mass loss rate for a red supergiant , @xmath9 @xcite , is consistent with its thick circumstellar envelope and suggests that vy  cma may be close to the end of its life cycle .",
    "high resolution images taken at optical and infrared wavelengths reveal complicated circumstellar dust structures @xcite . however , it is difficult to investigate the innermost circumstellar structures via the continuum emission because of the high opacity .",
    "vy cma s extended outflowing envelope is traced by various species of molecular masers that conform to the standard paradigm for late type and supergiant stars whereby various species trace specific layers of the envelope for reasons involving density and excitation process ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the unusual characteristics of the emission from the circumstellar envelope is the high degree of linear polarization in the sio @xmath10 lines .",
    "the only other stars that are known to show polarization in the sio ground state are r cas @xcite and orion kl / irc2 source i @xcite .",
    "we report the first imaging for the @xmath11 transition with high angular resolution and also describe the spectral characteristics of the strong linear polarization detected in this line .",
    "observations of the sio emissions in the @xmath11 transition ( 215.595950 ghz ) towards vy cma were made with the partially completed _ submillimeter array _ ( sma ; @xcite ) , located on mauna kea , on 7 december 2002 under fair weather conditions ( the zenith opacity @xmath12 0.15 @xmath13 0.2 ) .",
    "the phase tracking center was set at ra  =  07@xmath14 22@xmath15 58.@xmath1627 , decl .",
    "=  25@xmath5 46@xmath17 03.@xmath184 ( j2000 ) and the field of view ( fov ) was 57@xmath18 . a compact configuration ( baselines ranging from 6.3 to 18.1 k@xmath19 ) with three antennas was employed for imaging the maser line .",
    "the beam size was 13.9@xmath18 @xmath20 5.6@xmath18 .",
    "the spectral window was centered at 10.0 kms@xmath4 in @xmath21 .",
    "the frequency resolution was @xmath2 400 khz .",
    "the typical double sideband system temperature was 500 k. we observed vy cma along with a relatively bright nearby quasar , 0727115 ( @xmath2 14@xmath22 away ) , for the relative amplitude and astrometeic phase calibration , and callisto for the absolute flux calibration .",
    "precise phase calibration was achieved through the use of the maser component at 35.9 kms@xmath4 as a phase reference .",
    "the passband calibration was done on jupiter .",
    "visibility data were calculated with the mir idl package @xcite .",
    "the quasar amplitude showed no systematic variation with random fluctuation less than @xmath2 10% of the mean value , which reflects the accuracy of the amplitude calibration .",
    "linear polarization measurements were accomplished by taking advantage of the diurnal rotation of the sky with respect to the axis of polarization sensitivity of the array .",
    "the sma antennas have alt - azimuth mounts , and the receivers , mounted at the nasmyth focus following reflections from five intermediate mirrors , have fixed linearly polarized feeds .",
    "the final reflection before the receiver is achieved with a wire grid , which ensures that the overall polarization purity is better than 20 db . because of the nasmyth optics , the plane of the receiver polarization outside the antenna with respect to the local vertical is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the elevation angle of the source .",
    "the feed position angle on the celestial frame is ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the latitude of the array ( @xmath2 19@xmath2249@xmath1727@xmath18 ) and @xmath27 is the source hour angle . in our experiment , @xmath27 ranged from @xmath28 hours to 2.5 hours and @xmath29 ranged from @xmath30 to 60 , which was sufficient to determine the linear polarization characteristics of the maser emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : specall ] shows an integrated spectrum ( vector average of all spectra ) of the sio high @xmath31 maser ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "the noise level in the spectrum was 1.1 jy .",
    "seven major velocity components have been identified by the number in the figure .",
    "in addition to these , we also detected two weak high velocity components at the red shifted edge , at @xmath21 @xmath2 48 and @xmath2 56 kms@xmath4 .",
    "the brightest maser , component 2 , has a very narrow line width ( @xmath32 0.5 kms@xmath4 at full width at half maximum ) corresponding to a thermal doppler width of about 600k if the maser is saturated .",
    "the line profile of the high @xmath31 transition is quite different from those of the lower @xmath31 transitions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , indicating different regions for their origins .",
    "figure  [ fig : polariall ] the flux densities of the seven major components at each @xmath29 . to determine the polarization of the masers , we fit the flux density of each maser component , @xmath33 , as a function of @xmath29 to the equation @xmath34\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the average flux density of maser component @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the polarized flux density , and @xmath38 is the position angle of the linear polarization .",
    "table 1 shows the results of this analysis .",
    "the fractional linear polarization , listed in the rightmost column of table 1 , is given by @xmath37/@xmath35 .",
    "the fractional polarization percentages ranged from less than 10 percent ( component 5 ) to about 60 percent ( components 1 and 2 ) .",
    "these values of fractional polarization are lower limits to the total polarization , since our measurement technique was not sensitive to circular polarization .",
    "since component 5 showed no measurable change in flux density over the 5.5 hour duration of the observations , we are confident that the gain of the sma was correctly calibrated throughout the experiment by the normal calibration on the nearby quasar , and that this component has no measurable linear polarization . to check this conclusion , and possibly improve the gain calibration , we performed the following analysis . after the linear analysis ( based on eq .",
    "( 2 ) ) to determine the three polarization parameters for each maser component , we examined the residuals at each time ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we estimated a gain factor correction for each time ( six parameters ) to minimize the overall deviations .",
    "we then solved again for the polarization parameters , and iterated the process several times .",
    "the solution converged quickly and stably , yielding the six gain factors : 1.00 , 1.00 , 1.04 , 0.94 , 0.99 , and 1.03 .",
    "the final polarization parameters were not significantly different from those obtained in the first iteration ( i.e. , gain factors set to unity ) .",
    "the iterative solution reduced the overall rms noise level by about 20 percent and reduced the @xmath39 to essentially unity .",
    "this demonstrates that the measurement of the polarization parameters are accurate to within the quoted errors and are not subject to systematic errors due to calibration errors in the gain of the array .",
    "it also shows that the @xmath40 priori gain calibration based on the interleaved quasar observations was quite good , and validates the implicit assumption that the maser components did not vary intrinsically by more than a few percent over the period of observations .",
    "we tested the hypothesis that the polarization angles of the maser spots are the same . under this assumption ,",
    "the weighted mean polarization angle is 72 @xmath41 4@xmath22 .",
    "the reduced @xmath42 is 1.13 , which strongly suggests that the polarization angles are the same and that the deviations from the mean of the position angles are not significant , except possibly for components 3 and 6 , which each deviate by about 1.5 @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the individual masers components are unresolved by the sma because their intrinsic sizes are less than ten milliarcsecond ( e.g. , see @xcite for discussion of maser angular sizes ) .",
    "we tried to measure the angular distribution of maser spots with respect to the strongest maser component 2 . to estimate the positions",
    ", we made an image for each spectral channel and fit it with a two dimensional gaussian function , using aips tasks imfit and jmfit . to improve the component position error estimates , we averaged the results over several channels that contributed to the maser emission of each spot .",
    "note that , for a point source , the determination of the peak of the image is statistically equivalent to a @xmath39 fitting of the phases ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , since the analysis is based on the assumption that the individual maser components are point sources , the fact that the synthesized beam had high sidelobes was not important . note that the visibility amplitude variations due to polarization do not bias the position estimate .",
    "since we referenced the phase of each maser to the phase of the reference feature , the effects of any systematic errors were eliminated to first order .",
    "any random phase errors between channels were reflected in the formal position errors .",
    "however , any systematic phase drifts between channels , caused by delay changes or electronic changes in the filter responses could have affected the measured positions .",
    "we have analyzed the phase versus time data for the reference quasar , spectrally resolved into four channels , and we found no evidence for any relative phase changes at the limit of about two degrees , which was limited by the measurement noise .",
    "the electronic stability and delay calibration of the system suggest that the relative phase changes are much smaller than this amount .",
    "a two degree systematic error would produce an error of less than 0.02@xmath43 in relative position .",
    "table 1 lists the positions of the masers , the relevant velocity ranges , and the measurement errors .",
    "the errors are close to the expected levels predicted by the formula @xmath44 ( e.g. @xcite ) , where bw is the beamwidth in direction of @xmath45 or decl . ,",
    "and snr is the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the snr of each component is its flux density divided by the measured noise of 1.10 jy obtained from the integrated spectrum .",
    "masers 3 , 4 , 5 , and 7 are coincident with maser 2 within the 1-@xmath3 error bars ( 150 mas in each coordinate or 200 au ) .",
    "these masers are most likely associated with the sio masers in the circumstellar shell at radius of 50 au .",
    "higher resolution measurements are needed to determine their exact positions in the shell .",
    "masers 1 and 6 are offset in declination by 1300 mas ( 2.5@xmath3 ) and 500 mas ( 4@xmath3 ) , respectively .",
    "these offsets might be real , but clearly have only marginal significance .",
    "although there appear to be no @xmath46 transition masers beyond the 50 mas shell @xcite , it is conceivable that masers could exist in the high @xmath31 transitions in the bipolar outflow due to shock excitation .",
    "masers 1 and 6 could be manifestations of such shocks .",
    "the positions of the maser spots are plotted in figure 3 , with the polarization indicated on each spot .",
    "we have placed component 2 between the two outflow lobes at the position set by the central star .",
    "if the assumption is correct , the uncertainty of the relative alignment of the two images is @xmath47 0.1 .",
    "the relative alignment of the @xmath10 image and our maser image is uncertain to @xmath47 0.5 , based on the positions of the reference quasars observed in these two measurements .",
    "note that the position angle of the polarization of maser component 2 ( 71 @xmath41 5@xmath22 ) and that of the mean of all the components ( 72 @xmath41 4@xmath22 ) are nearly aligned with the outflow .",
    "this correlation suggests a relationship between the circumstellar envelope and the more extended bipolar outflow . note that since the components are on both sides of the systemic velocity , they arise in both the approaching and receding sides of the envelopes .",
    "we imaged the continuum emission in the line free channels .",
    "because of the poor beamshape of the array , we could not determine the spatial structure of the continuum .",
    "however , we measured the total flux density to be 270 @xmath41 40 mjy .",
    "the flux at 301 ghz and 658 ghz measured with the sma recently were 340 @xmath41 10 mjy and 7.8 @xmath41 2.6 jy , respectively .",
    "the sed obtained by combining our results with other measurements in the submillimeter band @xcite give a spectral index for flux density of about @xmath13 3.0 for the frequency range 200 @xmath13 750 ghz .",
    "the emission is clearly almost entirely due to dust , with a small contribution from the star .",
    "the spectral index is slightly less ( @xmath13 2.5 ) over the range 1,000 @xmath13 15,000 ghz ( 300 @xmath13 20 microns ) @xcite .",
    "two theories have been proposed to explain the sio maser pumping mechanism , especially for the low @xmath31 transitions : radiative pumping @xcite and collisional pumping @xcite .",
    "the positional coincidence of emission among different @xmath48 1 vibrational states as observed with knife @xcite seems to support the collisional pumping theory .    on the other hand ,",
    "the 60@xmath49 linear polarization that we observe suggests radiative pumping @xcite . a fractional polarization this high for the @xmath1 transition apparently requires anisotropy in the angular distribution of the ir radiation involved in determining the populations of the masing states @xcite.this anisotropy could occur , in principle , for either collisional ( through the escaping ir radiation ) or radiative pumping .",
    "however , it occurs more naturally for radiative pumping since the incident ir radiation comes from the direction of the star , and is a larger effect in this case @xcite .",
    "note that most theoretical analyses predict lower polarization in the higher @xmath31 transitions , contrary to observations .",
    "the polarization direction of the radiation would be parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field if g@xmath50 @xmath51 r , @xmath52 , where g@xmath50 is the zeeman rate , 1.5 rad s@xmath4 mg@xmath4 , @xmath52 is the maser level decay rate , about 5 s@xmath4 , and r is stimulated emission rate , 4 x 10@xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 , where @xmath54 is the brightness temperature and @xmath55 is the maser beam angle @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the polarization would be aligned with the direction of the pump anisotropy .",
    "the vlba image of the sio masers in the @xmath56 transition suggest that the spot sizes are about 2 mas ( about 2 au ) @xcite , so the maximum brightness temperature is about 4 x 10@xmath57k .",
    "taking @xmath58 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the masers satisfy the g@xmath59 r criterion if @xmath60 10 mg .",
    "since the magnetic field in the water masers in vy cma has been estimated to be about 150 mg , based on a zeeman interpretation of the observed circular polarization @xcite , polarization would be expected to trace the magnetic field .",
    "note that well ordered magnetic fields have been seen in other sio masers ( e.g. vy cma : @xcite , tx cam : @xcite ) .",
