    "realistic microscopic modeling of application - relevant electronic nanostructures typically requires the consideration of 100 - 1000 single - particle basis states ( orbitals ) . normally , due to the lack symmetries ,",
    "such systems are inhomogeneous and anisotropic and furthermore may exhibit a long - range interaction . with a suitable unitary transformation and a subsequent division of the single - particle hilbert space , the number of relevant single - particle states that require a many - body treatment of the coulomb interaction typically can be reduced to @xmath0256 .",
    "even with this reduction , the resulting fock space dimension obviously grows beyond practical numerical limits , at least for a full exact diagonalization ( full - ci ) . in order to address this problem",
    "one can take the path to consider a highly idealized model ( such as anderson- or hubbard - like models @xcite ) , mapping the actual nanosystem to a reduced ( albeit non - trivial ) model system with a small number of effective parameters .",
    "such an approach can be justified in the sense that only a small number of degrees of freedom typically are relevant for the investigated fundamental effects .",
    "nevertheless , these relevant degrees of freedom and their associated effective parameters in general are non - linear functions of the actual experimentally accessible parameters ( such as gate voltages and general external electromagnetic fields ) and not known a - priori . as an advantage however , due to the simplified structure of the model hamiltonians , one is able to understand the physics of such idealized models in detail ( in particular , the possibility to correctly include continuous semi - infinite contacts ) .",
    "however , in order to determine effective parameters ( as a function of external quantities and material properties ) and to obtain a more realistic description of the nanosystem ( in particular for the simulation of application - relevant structures ) , methods which incorporate more microscopic details are mandatory .",
    "while ab - initio methods in principle provide this kind of information , they often involve approximation schemes ( such as mean - field approximations ) that are not suitable for the description of many - body correlations which certainly can not be neglected in nanosystems with quantum effects .",
    "nevertheless , ab - initio basis functions and matrix elements might serve as input parameters for subsequent many - body approaches . in this context",
    ", very sophisticated methods have been developed in the field of many - body physics ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and quantum chemistry ( see refs .",
    "typically , these approaches are competitive only for specialized systems or conditions , such as : groundstate , equilibrium or close to equilibrium , idealized model interaction or periodic systems , limited - particle excitations , small single - particle basis , restriction to systems with special symmetries ( such as spin and total angular momentum , leading to block - diagonal hamiltonians ) , restriction to fock - darwin single - particle basis ( or even 2d - harmonic potential only ) .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss a recursive scheme which is able to describe a finite ( or quasi - isolated ) nanosystem with a large number of single - particle basis states ( typ .",
    "256 ) and to calculate a sufficient number ( typ . a few 1000 ) of relevant excited many - body states .",
    "note that the states we are interested in are not necessarily close to the groundstate .",
    "this approach consists of two steps : ( i ) recursive construction of a large set of relevant slater - determinants ( `` bucket brigade algorithm '' ) as discussed in this paper .",
    "( ii ) many - body calculations within the resulting fock - subspace .",
    "for an arbitrarily given single - particle orthonormal ( on ) basis @xmath1 the exact many - body hamiltonian of the finite ( i.e. , discrete ) system in second quantization reads as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote single - particle and coulomb two - particle matrix elements of the total system hamiltonian , and @xmath5 is the annihilation operator for single - particle state @xmath6 .    : for a considered bucket @xmath7 copy all existing states , add new states by applying @xmath8 to all existing states from previous bucket ( @xmath9 ) and truncate with the help of the measure @xmath10 .",
    "filled circles represent single - particle states and @xmath7 denotes the particle number in the bucket .",
    "( the shown truncation is just an example.),width=480 ]    let @xmath11 be the maximum number of single - particle states that shall be considered .",
    "hence , we consider a subspace spanned by @xmath12 .",
    "the recursion procedure can be formulated in terms of a sequence of sets @xmath13 of slater - determinants . here , @xmath14 denotes the recursion step number and @xmath15 is the particle number .",

    ", @xmath27 denotes the fock space vacuum state , @xmath28 is the number of elements in set @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ( with @xmath15 ) are given integers which determine the maximum number of states in @xmath13 ( for all @xmath31 ) .",
    "note that the maximum number of slater - determinants for @xmath7 particles reads as @xmath32 hence , we must have @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 is a suitable real `` measure '' for the selection of slater - determinants . for a normalized slater - determinant @xmath34 , we assume a measure of the form @xmath35 with a ( w.o.l.g .",
    "diagonal ) many - body operator @xmath36 .",
    "the latter can be expanded in a series of @xmath37-particle product terms @xmath38 with @xmath39 for single - particle state @xmath6 an real coefficients @xmath40 , which represent conditional @xmath37-particle selection weights . in the simplest case",
    ", one can choose the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian , that is @xmath41 ( note that this choice might not provide a unique set if some slater - determinants are degenerate . )",
    "optionally , the final truncation condition can be made even more selective , choosing for example only such slater - determinants which have energies that are within certain energy intervals ( such as `` bands '' ) . from this construction",
    "it is obvious that the set @xmath13 contains only slater - determinants with a total number of @xmath7 particles . as a physical interpretation , with each recursion step @xmath18",
    "the set @xmath42 consists of the lowest @xmath30 states from the combination of @xmath13 and all states of @xmath43 with an extra particle created in the single - particle state @xmath44 . to some extent ,",
    "the described procedure resembles the nrg recursion scheme , however , lacking the diagonalization steps at this stage ( see next paragraph ) .    if we are solely interested in calculating expectation values of observables for a fixed particle number @xmath45 , it is sufficient to calculate @xmath13 for @xmath46 only and to consider the last set @xmath47 in the following .",
    "however , if @xmath37-point green s functions ( i.e. , contour - ordered correlation functions of @xmath48 creation and annihilation operators at @xmath37 points in time ) have to be calculated as well , we typically need information about all fock subspaces of particle numbers @xmath49 .",
    "obviously , @xmath37 is restricted to @xmath50 .",
    "since the single - particle subspace basis @xmath51 might be optimized only for states with @xmath45 particles , it could become sub - optimal for @xmath52 .",
    "in general , we thus could consider an individual subspace basis @xmath53 for each @xmath54 and an individual @xmath55 $ ] .    from the obtained @xmath56",
    ", we can now define a finite fock subspace @xmath57 spanned by the many - body basis @xmath58 of `` relevant '' slater - determinants @xmath59 and with dimension @xmath60 note that the states of @xmath56 for different @xmath7 are orthogonal to each other since they obviously have different particle numbers . by construction",
    ", the states within @xmath56 for a fixed @xmath7 are orthonormalized . hence",
    ", @xmath58 is a many - body on - basis of @xmath61 . in turn",
    ", a corresponding finite restricted hamiltonian can be defined as @xmath62 which acts within @xmath61 . as the final step , @xmath63",
    "is diagonalized numerically in a matrix representation with respect to the basis @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath64 conserves the particle number , @xmath64 is block - diagonal within individual @xmath65 . with the help of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath63 one",
    "can calculate the time evolution of the isolated system and can construct stationary statistical operators for the calculation of expectation values .    by considering only those slater - determinants that are chosen as `` relevant '' by the described algorithm ,",
    "two controlled approximations are made : first , the number of considered single - particle states @xmath11 is finite .",
    "equivalently , the recursion step is performed only a finite number of times @xmath11 .",
    "second , the maximum number @xmath30 of slater - determinants in each set @xmath13 can be smaller than @xmath66 . in the limit @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( @xmath46 ) , the algorithm becomes exact .",
    "the described algorithm typically becomes advantageous if the required maximum number of single - particle states @xmath11 and the number of particles @xmath45 provides a number @xmath69 of slater - determinants that lies beyond the limit for which the resulting problem can be fully diagonalized , in particular for strongly inhomogeneous systems with minimal symmetries .",
    "typical application - relevant values are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "for such a regime , nrg - based approaches might become impractical since the storage requirements of matrices for the given @xmath11 and @xmath30 grow beyond realistic limits . in principle , the described algorithm is suitable to provide a basis for many - body states up to any energy scale since all single - particle states are scanned systematically .",
    "it can be used in particular for many - body problems where a single set of slater - determinants has to be determined which is relevant for a whole energy interval of many - body eigenstates ( not only the groundstate or a particular excited state ) .",
    "an implementation on parallel computer architectures is possible .",
    "within this algorithm , two means of ( a - posteriori ) optimization exist : ( i ) choice of the single - particle basis and in particular its order .",

    "alternatively , one can define an outer self - consistency loop for the described algorithm . here",
