    "a * tiling * of the plane is a collection of tiles @xmath9 , whose union is @xmath8 and which have pairwise disjoint interiors .    in @xcite",
    ", thurston introduced the notion of * self - similar tiling . *",
    "this definition was motivated from several sources : most notably , in tilings arising from markov partitions for hyperbolic toral automorphisms , one - dimensional tilings arising from substitutions , and also the penrose tilings , which have a simple subdivision rule to create new tilings out of old .",
    "a * self - similar tiling * is a tiling @xmath9 of the plane which has the following properties :    1 .   there is an equivalence relation @xmath10 on tiles , with a finite number of equivalence classes , such that @xmath11 implies @xmath12 is a _ translate _ of @xmath13 .",
    "2 .   there is a homothety @xmath14 , @xmath15 , such that the image of a tile is equal to a union of tiles of @xmath16 , 3 .",
    "if @xmath11 , and @xmath17 , then for each tile @xmath18 , @xmath19 is a tile of @xmath16 equivalent to @xmath20 .",
    "the tiling is quasiperiodic ( see definition below ) .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ sst ] ( more information about this example is given in section [ endos ] ) .",
    "let us make a few remarks regarding this definition .",
    "the third condition simply states that two equivalent tiles `` subdivide '' in the same way .",
    "\\2 . here by * quasiperiodic",
    "* we mean , any `` arrangement '' ( finite collection of tiles , up to translation ) of tiles in the tiling reoccurs at a bounded distance from any point in the tiling . more formally , for any @xmath21 there is an @xmath22 such that for all @xmath23 a translate of the arrangement of tiles in @xmath24 occurs as a subset of in @xmath25 .",
    "this property is almost the same as the _ local isomorphism property _ of radin and wolff @xcite , and is identical if one assumes in their case that there are a finite number of local arrangements ( which in our case is a consequence of the definition ) .",
    "this condition is really a compactness condition : indeed , this condition is equivalent to the condition that the orbit closure @xmath26 of the tiling ( under the action of @xmath8 by translations ) is minimal : every @xmath8-leaf of @xmath26 is dense in @xmath26 @xcite . under reasonable assumptions on the subdivision rule for tiles ,",
    "this condition is easily checkable , see lemma [ prim ] , below .",
    "\\3 . by replacing `` translations '' in the first and third conditions by some other group of homeomorphisms of @xmath8 , e.g. by isometries ,",
    "one arrives at a more general definition of self - similar tiling .",
    "so technically we should refer to our definition as that of a",
    "_ translation_-self - similar tiling .",
    "however for succinctness ( and to agree with thurston s terminology ) in this paper we shall simply say `` self - similar tiling '' , with the translations understood .",
    "the results as stated below are unknown for isometry - self - similar tilings ; for similarity - self - similar tilings , see @xcite .",
    "thurston proved that the expansion coefficient @xmath3 of a self - similar tiling had to be a special type of algebraic integer , a complex perron number .",
    "he indicated , without proof , that for each complex perron number there existed a tiling . in this article",
    "we give a construction of a self - similar tiling for any complex perron number .",
    "a * complex perron number * is an algebraic integer which is strictly larger in modulus than its galois conjugates ( the other roots of its minimal polynomial ) , except for @xmath27 , its complex conjugate .",
    "the expansion of a self - similar tiling is a complex perron number .",
    "[ thth ]    in section [ const ] we will prove by construction :    for each complex perron number @xmath3 there is a self - similar tiling with expansion @xmath3 . [ 1 ]    the methods we use are very geometric and are inspired by conversations with and ideas of thurston .    this construction allows an easy corollary , whose proof we give in section [ cors ] :    [ rotate ] @xmath3 is the expansion of a self - similar tiling invariant under a rotation @xmath28 ( @xmath29 an integer ) if and only if either @xmath30 and @xmath3 is a complex perron number for which @xmath31 $ ] , or @xmath32 is a complex perron number and @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "note that in the case @xmath34 we conclude : any complex perron number is the expansion for a self - similar tiling invariant under @xmath35 .    for an example of this theorem , consider the symmetric penrose tiling , which is invariant under rotation by @xmath36 .",
    "one possible expansion of this tiling is the degree-@xmath37 complex perron number @xmath38 and @xmath6={{\\bbb q}}[e^{\\pi i/5}]$ ] .    in section [ endos ]",
    "we will give a simpler construction for self - similar tilings whose expansion coefficients are of a particular type : those non - real complex perron numbers @xmath3 satisfying an equation of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 are integers .",
    "this construction has the advantage of being very concrete .",
    "self - similar tilings appear in several quite different contexts .",
    "in fact up to now they have not really had a life of their own , but have rather been studied independently by people working in different fields .",
    "self - similar tilings did not really exist before the computer age , although some precursors can be found @xcite .",
    "one could also trace back the roots to the work of adler and weiss @xcite , bowen @xcite and sinai @xcite on the construction of markov partitions , which can be interpreted as the first general constructions for self - similar tilings .",
    "most of the first _ explicit _ examples of self - similar tilings were curiosities , found in popular books on fractals with fanciful names such as the `` heighway dragon curve '' and `` gosper flowsnake '' .",
    "the penrose tilings @xcite were another curiosity until some nonperiodic crystals displaying @xmath41-fold `` symmetry '' were actually discovered in nature ; these  quasicrystals \" gave life to a new field of crystallography .",
    "the theory of wavelets is another new field which has caused people to become interested in `` self - replicating '' tilings ( self - similar tilings with one tile type ) , and much work has been done since on this special class of self - similar tilings @xcite .",
    "our current construction has its origins in another point of view . working in the field of symbolic dynamics ,",
    "lind @xcite gave a characterization of the largest eigenvalues of nonnegative integer matrices , which gives as corollary a characterization of the expansions of self - similar tilings of the line .",
    "then thurston @xcite in 1989 took a step up from this result , defining self - similar tilings and proving the neat theorem [ thth ] above . as a thesis student of thurston ,",
    "i extended his result to @xmath29-dimensional self - affine tilings ( in which the expansion is a linear map of @xmath42 diagonalizable over @xmath43 ) @xcite .",
    "not much later praggastis @xcite gave a more explicit construction of markov partitions for ( certain ) hyperbolic toral automorphisms using the theory of self - similar tilings .",
    "this work is also very close to that of vershik @xcite who constructs such markov partitions _",
    "arithmetically _ , that is , using radix representations .",
    "self - similar subdivisions ( of various sorts ) occur nowadays in the theory of rational maps , kleinian and hyperbolic groups ( via the action on the sphere at infinity or space of geodesics using an automatic structure ) , wavelets , crystallography ( in quasicrystals ) , symbolic dynamics and number theory ( in radix representations ) , and logic ( in wang tiles , aperiodic tilings , and computability : surprisingly , the only known aperiodic tilings are built from self - similar patterns ) .",
    "the * tile types * in a self - similar tiling are the distinct equivalence classes of tiles . to a self - similar tiling with @xmath29 tile types",
    "is associated a nonnegative @xmath44 integer matrix @xmath45 , the * subdivision matrix * , in which @xmath46 is the number of tiles of type @xmath47 that a tile of type @xmath48 subdivides into upon scaling by @xmath3 . by property @xmath49",
    "this matrix is well - defined .",
    "the perron ( i.e. largest ) eigenvalue of this matrix is @xmath50 , whose corresponding eigenvector is the vector of tile areas .",
    "recall that a nonnegative matrix is called * primitive * if some power is strictly positive . in the case of a self - similar tiling",
    ", the subdivision matrix must be primitive , since every tile , when scaled by @xmath51 for large enough @xmath29 , must contain a copy of every tile type by quasiperiodicity .",
    "primitivity also implies that the spectral radius @xmath52 is a * perron number * , that is , @xmath52 is a real algebraic integer strictly larger than the modulus of any galois conjugate .",
    "we have the following result ( whose proof is an application of the definitions ) which we shall use later .    a tiling which satisfies the first three hypotheses of a self - similar tiling ,",
    "has a tile with the origin in its interior and has primitive subdivision matrix , is quasiperiodic , and hence self - similar .",
    "[ prim ]      we review here the definition of the delauney triangulation . given a discrete set of points",
    "@xmath53 in @xmath8 , the delauney triangulation is the triangulation of the convex hull of @xmath53 , with triangles having vertices in @xmath53 , with the property that , for any triangle @xmath54 , the circumcircle of @xmath55 contains no point of @xmath53 .",
    "such a triangulation exists ( for example , one can see this by using stereographic projection of the plane to the sphere in @xmath56 ; the convex hull in @xmath56 of the image of @xmath53 is a polyhedron whose faces are ( generically ) the triangles in the delauney triangulation ) and is unique unless some four or more points lie on the same empty circle .",
    "another property that we will use is the local nature of the triangulation : if for some small @xmath57 there is a point of @xmath53 within a distance @xmath57 of any point of @xmath58 , then the set of triangles with vertex @xmath59 depend only on those points in @xmath60 .",
    "( to see this , notice that an empty circle passing through @xmath59 has diameter at most @xmath61 . )",
    "the idea of the construction is as follows .",
    "we define the set @xmath62 of `` archtypes '' of the tiles in our eventual tiling to be the set of all triangles with vertices in an appropriate lattice and edges of bounded length . when we multiply a triangle in @xmath62 by @xmath51 for large enough @xmath29",
    ", we can subdivide it approximately into triangles in @xmath62 .",
    "( this is where we use the complex - perron - number property of @xmath3 ) .",
    "however we need a way to define the subdivision of triangles so that , if two triangles are adjacent , their subdivisions agree at their common boundary .",
    "so rather than just keep track of a triangle we keep track of a triangle and all its immediate neighbors .",
    "this gives a new larger set of archtypes @xmath63 .",
    "the subdivisions of elements of @xmath63 can now be defined so that they",
    "_ agree _ whenever there is an overlap between them .",
    "one small hitch is to make this subdivision rule primitive . to ensure this we define a special tile @xmath64 that occurs in the subdivision of any tile , including itself .",
    "our set of tiles will then be the strongly connected component of the `` subdivision graph '' which contains @xmath64 .",

    "let @xmath149 be a surrounding of @xmath144 .",
    "for each edge @xmath203 in @xmath55 ( between vertices @xmath232 and @xmath233 of @xmath55 ) draw a polygonal arc @xmath234 from @xmath235 to @xmath236 , which is contained in @xmath237 , and has edges contained in the set of edges of triangles in the triangulation of @xmath238 .",
    "the part of the path @xmath234 in @xmath239 should depend only on this neighborhood ; similarly the part of the path in @xmath240 should depend only on that neighborhood , and the part of the path along the edge should depend only on @xmath237 .",
    "this is to guarantee that the paths for different surroundings agree whenever there is overlap .",
    "for example , if triangles @xmath241 and @xmath242 are adjacent along an edge @xmath203 , then the path @xmath234 along @xmath243 will be the same for the surrounding of @xmath241 as for @xmath242 .",
    "furthermore the choice of paths in vertex neighborhoods @xmath239 should be made so that the paths going out along different edges incident at the vertex should be * non - crossing * and * diverging * ( although such paths may have common initial segments , they are disjoint except for a connected initial segment ) .",
    "see figure [ pathchoice ] .",
    "define @xmath244 , so that @xmath245 is a polygonal arc between vertices of @xmath55 which follows closely the edge @xmath203 .",
    "define @xmath246 to be the concatenation of the 3 edge paths @xmath247 , removing any `` backtracking '' which may occur near the three vertices : that is , if the last edge of @xmath248 is the same as the first edge of @xmath249 in the reverse direction , remove these two edges from @xmath246 , and so on .",
    "so @xmath246 is a simple closed polygonal path running once around @xmath55 .",
    "the paths @xmath250 are composed of edges of triangles in @xmath62 . to each such edge @xmath251",
    "is associated its arc @xmath252 .",

    "inductively define @xmath257 by replacing each edge @xmath258 in @xmath259 by a copy of @xmath260 and removing backtracks .",
    "these paths @xmath259 converge as @xmath261 to a simple closed curve @xmath262 running around @xmath55 : @xmath259 lies in the @xmath263-neighborhood of @xmath264 , for some constant @xmath265 , so the paths converge in the hausdorff metric .",
    "the limits are arcs by our choice of @xmath29 , which is so large that any potential non - injectivity in @xmath259 must occur near a vertex of @xmath264 , where by construction it can not occur .    for each @xmath149 ,",
    "the jordan curve @xmath262 forms the boundary of a tile @xmath266 .",
    "a similar construction gives a jordan curve for the boundary of @xmath64 .",
    "these tiles @xmath266 have the property that @xmath267 subdivides exactly into other tiles in @xmath268 . also @xmath130 subdivides exactly into a copy of @xmath64 and certain @xmath266 .",
    "let @xmath269 , where @xmath270 .",
    "we have now constructed a tiling of the plane , with tiles which are translates of tiles in a subset of @xmath112 ( not every element of @xmath112 may actually occur in the tiling ) . by construction when we multiply the tiling by @xmath3 and subdivide each tile according to the rules established above ( @xmath64 subdivides into the tiles as defined in section [ t0 ] , each tile in @xmath271 maps homothetically to a tile in @xmath272 unless @xmath273 in which case a tile subdivides as described in section [ t0inthere ] ) .",
    "furthermore tiles of the same type ( i.e. those arising from the same element of @xmath145 , and which are of the same size ) subdivide in the same way .",
    "furthermore each tile occurring in the tiling arises from eventual subdivision of the tile @xmath64 , since @xmath64 has the origin in its interior .",
    "each tile eventually has a copy of @xmath64 in its subdivision .",
    "so the subdivision matrix is primitive , and hence the tiling is quasiperiodic ( lemma [ prim ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "let @xmath274 be a self - similar tiling invariant under @xmath275 and having expansion constant @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 is real , then by redefining the subdivision rule we have that @xmath274 is self - similar with expansion @xmath276 .",
    "thus we can assume @xmath3 is not real unless @xmath277 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that for any self - similar tiling with expansion @xmath30 there is a homothetic copy @xmath278 of @xmath6 $ ] such that translations between tiles of the same type must be in @xmath278 .",
    "so if the tiling is invariant under @xmath279 , then if @xmath280 is a translation between tiles of the same type , both @xmath281 and @xmath282 are in @xmath278 , so their ratio @xmath275 must be in @xmath6 $ ] .    in case",
    "@xmath277 we also have @xmath283 $ ] .    to construct a tiling invariant under rotation by @xmath284 ,",
    "modify the construction of section [ const ] as follows .",
    "select the tile @xmath64 to be invariant under @xmath275 .",
    "then the region between @xmath130 and @xmath64 has a @xmath275-invariant triangulation .",
    "the construction now proceeds as before .",
    "note that @xmath275 is an algebraic integer , and multiplication by @xmath275 acts as an _ isometry _ on the space @xmath87 and the lattice @xmath96 .",
    "since the subdivision defined in section [ subd ] depends solely on the metric properties of the objects involved , the subdivision is natural in the sense that two elements @xmath285 ( surroundings of @xmath193 respectively ) which are isometric copies of each other have subdivisions which are isometric .",
    "( note that even if @xmath286 and @xmath287 overlap , the naturality of the subdivision implies that they will subdivide isometrically ) .    the only place in the construction where we again had a choice was in defining the paths running around the tiles .",
    "however we claim that we can make this choice in a way which only depends on the isometry type of the relevant vertex or edge .",
    "the only difficulty arises when isometric surroundings overlap .",
    "if @xmath241 and @xmath242 meet at a vertex @xmath161 and the isometry from @xmath241 to @xmath242 takes @xmath161 to @xmath161 , then the subdivision near @xmath161 is already @xmath288-invariant , so one can choose paths running out from that vertex in a @xmath288-invariant fashion . similarly if @xmath241 and @xmath242 meet along an edge @xmath203 , and the isometry taking @xmath241 to @xmath242 takes @xmath203 to @xmath203 , then the subdivision of @xmath203 is invariant under this isometry and so one can choose the path @xmath234 to also be invariant .",
    "these choices imply the naturality of the entire construction .    so the resulting tiling will be invariant under @xmath275 .",
    "in this section we give a construction for self - similar tilings whose expansion coefficient is a complex perron number which satisfies @xmath289 for some @xmath290 and integers @xmath291 .",
    "we will first do the case @xmath292 .",
    "let @xmath293 be vectors pointing in different directions in @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath294 be the set of compact polygonal paths starting at the origin , each of whose edges is a translate of @xmath295 or @xmath296 , and which are non - backtracking in the sense that along the path a segment @xmath59 is never immediately followed by @xmath297 .",
    "thus to each element in @xmath294 is associated a unique element in the free group on three symbols @xmath298 .",
    "indeed , one can easily define a product on @xmath294 in such a way that the map @xmath299 is a group isomorphism : to obtain the product of two paths , translate the second to the end of the first , and then cancel any `` backtrackings '' .",
    "consider the three commutators @xmath303=aba^{-1}b^{-1},[b , c],$ ] and @xmath304 $ ] ; they represent three closed paths .",
    "their images under @xmath305 can be written : @xmath306)&=&[\\phi(a),\\phi(b)]=[b , c]\\\\ \\label{tr2 } \\phi([b , c])&=&[c , c^pa^{-r}b^{-q}]=c^pa^{-r}[a^r , c](b^{-q}[b^q , c]b^q)a^rc^{-p}\\\\ \\phi([a , c])&=&[b , c^pa^{-r}b^{-q}]=[b , c^p]c^pa^{-r}[a^r , b]a^rc^{-p } \\label{tr3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the identities @xmath307=(x^{n-1}[x , y]x^{1-n})\\cdots(x[x , y]x^{-1})[x , y]\\ ] ] and @xmath308=[x , y](y[x , y]y^{-1})\\ldots(y^{n-1}[x , y]y^{1-n})\\ ] ] in the above , we see that each of @xmath309),\\phi([b , c])$ ] and @xmath310)$ ] can be written as a product of conjugates of @xmath303,[b , c],$ ] and @xmath304 $ ] . interpreting this in terms of paths in @xmath8 , the closed paths @xmath311),f\\phi([b , c]),f\\phi([a , c])$ ] can each be tiled by translates of copies of the parallelograms @xmath312),f([b , c]),f([a , c])$ ] .",
    "geometrically , the images @xmath312),f([b , c]),f([c , a])$ ] are `` archtiles '' for a self - similar tiling of the plane .",

    "the images @xmath314 , where @xmath315 can be tiled by translates of tiles in @xmath112 : the exact translates can be calculated from the formulas in ( [ tr1]),([tr2]),([tr3 ] ) .",
    "take @xmath293 to be the vectors @xmath316 and @xmath317 respectively .",
    "the equation ( [ pqr ] ) implies that the argument of @xmath3 is less than @xmath318 degrees , so that @xmath319,f[b , c],f[a , c]$ ] each have the same orientation .",
    "( in particular this implies that the tiling will be non - overlapping . )",
    "then @xmath320 , @xmath321 , and @xmath322 is a path whose endpoint is at @xmath323 .    now",
    "the closed paths @xmath324 for @xmath315 converge after rescaling to the boundaries of certain tiles @xmath325 , and @xmath326 can be tiled by exactly by translates of @xmath327 and @xmath328 . this is sufficient to make a self - similar tiling of the plane .      for the case",
    "@xmath329 , a similar construction will work .",
    "here we must use the free group on @xmath29 letters @xmath330 , with an endomorphism @xmath331 for @xmath332 and @xmath333 .",
