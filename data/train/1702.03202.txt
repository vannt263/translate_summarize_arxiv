    "the quantum optical processes in lossy and lossless material systems have been widely studied during the last few decades . this has led to advances , e.g. , in nanoplasmonics @xcite , near - field microscopy @xcite , thin - film light - emitting diodes @xcite , photonic crystals @xcite , and metamaterials @xcite . for describing spatial field evolution in resonant structures ,",
    "one of the most widely used quantization approaches has been the input - output formalism of the photon creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the formalism was originally developed for describing lossless and dispersionless dielectrics @xcite and was later extended for lossy and dispersive media @xcite .",
    "the early studies clearly highlighted that the noise and field operators in nonuniform systems are position dependent and that the vector potential and electric - field operators obey the well - known canonical commutation relation as expected @xcite .",
    "however , the canonical commutation relations did not extend to the photon creation and annihilation operators , which were found to exhibit anomalies in resonant structures @xcite .",
    "it was first concluded that these anomalies have no physical significance .",
    "although the formalism was later successfully used to study , e.g. , amplifying media and spontaneous decay in left - handed media @xcite , it was also recently shown that the anomalous commutation relations should , e.g. , lead to the existence of a threshold for second - harmonic generation inside microcavities @xcite .",
    "the anomalous commutation relations have also been found to prevent a systematic description of local thermal balance between the field and interacting media @xcite .",
    "we recently solved the cavity commutation relation anomaly and photon - number problem by introducing a quantized fluctuational electrodynamics ( qfed ) model to describe photon number and showed that the expectation values of the properly normalized annihilation and creation operators result in a meaningful photon - number model and thermal balance conditions @xcite . this far ,",
    "our models have been strictly one - dimensional and limited to normal incidence in planar structures , which has provided an adequate framework for describing the fundamental properties of cavity fields .",
    "however , considering the associated transparent description of the photon number and field temperature , it becomes reasonable to ask how the description can be expanded to more complex systems involving , e.g. , plasmons that have been of great topical interest @xcite and whose description could benefit from the new methodology clearly separating the local density of states ( ldos ) and the photon number .",
    "here we therefore present a generalized qfed model to account for fully three - dimensional propagation as well as the associated spectral expansion for planar structures .",
    "we also demonstrate the benefits of the formalism by applying it to study the local steady - state field properties and plasmonic interactions in a light - emitting near - surface ingan quantum - well ( qw ) structure with a metallic coating supporting surface plasmons ( sps ) .",

    "<S> we overcome the main limitation of the one - dimensional qfed formalism by extending the model to three dimensions , allowing us to use the qfed method to study , e.g. , plasmonic structures . to demonstrate the benefits of the developed formalism , we apply it to study the local steady - state photon numbers and field temperatures in a light - emitting near - surface ingan quantum - well structure with a metallic coating supporting surface plasmons . </S>"
