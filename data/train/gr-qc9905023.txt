    "according to thorne@xcite , gravitational wave ( gw ) astronomy `` will create a revolution in our view of the universe comparable to or greater than that which resulted from the discovery of radio waves . ''",
    "he further asserts that `` when gravitational waves are finally seen , they will come predominantly from sources we have not thought of or we have underestimated . '' it follows that gw data analysis tools should include detection methods for poorly modeled and unmodeled signal waveforms .",
    "however , at present the only well - characterized method being widely implemented for the detection of gws from burst or transient sources is wiener s optimal filter @xcite .",
    "this is a natural choice for sources whose signal waveforms are theoretically well modeled , because it is the optimal linear detection algorithm for such waveforms @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the effectiveness of optimal filtering is greatly reduced by errors in the predicted signal waveform .",
    "furthermore , even small errors in gw source modeling can lead to large cumulative errors in the predicted waveform @xcite .",
    "optimal filtering is therefore a poor technique for inadequately modeled ( or unmodeled ) sources .",
    "in fact , only two potential gw sources , binary inspiral and black hole quasi - normal ringdown , are thought to be adequately modeled for this method to work .",
    "clearly , a method whose effectiveness is only weakly dependent on ( or perhaps independent of ) prior knowledge of the signal is needed .",
    "we call such methods `` robust .",
    "''    one class of robust techniques widely used for signal analysis is time - frequency ( tf ) methods ( cf .",
    "the central idea is straightforward : one simultaneously decomposes the data in two bases , time and frequency .",
    "the resulting distribution , @xmath3 , represents the energy of the data waveform at time @xmath4 and frequency @xmath5 .",
    "time - frequency methods are well suited to analyzing interferometric gravitational wave data .",
    "since interferometers are broad band instruments , the noise energy will be distributed throughout the tf plane .",
    "gws , on the other hand , are caused by bulk motions of matter and energy , and their spectra tend to be peaked about characteristic frequencies determined by the source dynamics .",
    "gw signals may therefore be identified as ridges in the surface @xmath3 . while preliminary investigation of time - frequency methods for gw data show promise , to date we know of no complete tf detection method that has been implemented and evaluated .",
    "this article describes and evaluates a time - frequency method for interferometric gw data analysis .",
    "the method has three steps :    1 .",
    "transform the interferometer data into a wigner - ville tf distribution @xmath3 ( described in section [ sec : dist ] ) , 2 .",
    "search for ridges in @xmath3 using steger s algorithm ( described in section [ sec : curve ] ) , 3 .",
    "threshold on length of ridge to eliminate false alarms .",
    "we find this algorithm can reliably detect weak signals in simulated data with minimal assumptions about the signal .",
    "our evaluation of the tf method ( section [ sec : det ] ) consists of estimating false alarm and false dismissal probabilities for a variety of signals .",
    "false alarm probabilities are estimated by applying the method to a large number of data segments containing only simulated initial ligo detector noise and simply counting detections . for false dismissal probability estimates ,",
    "the same procedure is performed on data containing both simulated initial ligo noise and simulated intermediate - mass ( @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) binary black hole coalescence ( bbhc ) waveforms .",
    "these waveforms are an appropriate testing ground for robust methods , since they are probably dominated by the poorly understood merger signal .",
    "furthermore , the recently discovered possible evidence of `` middleweight '' black holes implies that these may be important sources of gws .",
    "flanagan and hughes have estimated the duration and frequency band of the merger signal , and our test waveforms are constructed to conform to these estimates ( see appendix [ sec : n&s ] for details ) .",
    "thus , while our model waveform is _ not _ the correct signal for a bbhc , we believe it has the correct general characteristics for our evaluation .",
    "the results of our evaluation are promising .",
    "we obtain a false alarm rate of one per 3.4 hours in a single detector , or approximately one per 475 years for coincident detection in the two ligo 4 km detectors . here",
    ", coincident means that signals are detected in both detectors within a certain time interval , or _",
    "coincidence window_. the coincidence window is taken to be 0.01 seconds ( the light travel time between the ligo 4 km detectors ) , since that is the maximum time interval between the arrival of a single gravitational wave ( which travels at the speed of light ) at these two detectors .",
    "false dismissal rates vary with the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) ( as measured by an optimal filter , cf .",
    "@xcite ) and binary mass , but as an example we find that approximately 3% of signals are lost at an snr of 11 for a @xmath8 bbhc .",
    "graphs showing false dismissal rates as a function of binary mass for a range of snrs and as a function of snr for a range of binary masses are presented in section [ sec : det ] .",
    "this tf method is also computationally efficient ; we are able to analyze data in these simulations at about twice the acquisition rate of the simulated data .",
    "while we are encouraged by these results , there is much more research to be done .",
    "we have restricted our attention in this paper to a single tf distribution ( wigner - ville ) , a single ridge detection scheme ( steger s algorithm ) , and a single thresholding scheme ( ridge length ) .",
    "for each of these there are a variety of choices available , and these choices need to be explored and evaluated . we have also restricted our attention to only bbhc signal models , and only for a limited binary mass range . while we feel that these are priority targets for such a robust search method , there are other sources which should be investigated . a more complete description of these and other issues for future research are presented in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the central idea of tf methods is to convert time domain data , @xmath9 , into a time - frequency distribution ( tfd ) @xmath3 . here , the variable @xmath5 labels the basis vectors in an alternative basis which spans the hilbert space to which @xmath9 belongs ( i.e. alternative to a basis labeled by @xmath4 ) . this alternative basis is usually the frequency basis associated with the fourier representation of @xmath9 ,",
    "although it need not be ( e.g. when wavelet bases are used ) . likewise , the meaning of @xmath3 varies , although it is usually associated in some way with the squared magnitude of @xmath10 at time @xmath4 and frequency @xmath5 .",
    "methods for constructing @xmath3 can be divided into two broad categories@xcite : _ atomic decompositions _ such as windowed fourier transforms and wavelet transforms and _ bilinear distributions _ of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes complex conjugation and the kernel @xmath13 satisfies @xmath14 both types of tfd might in principle be used to detect gravitational waves .",
    "the choice of a suitable tfd is governed by two requirements .",
    "the first is that the tfd must have good time - frequency localization properties . by this",
    "we mean the following : if a signal written in the form @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 a continuously differentiable monotonic function ) satisfies the adiabaticity conditions @xmath17 where @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 for all @xmath4 , then it should give rise to a distribution @xmath3 which has support only in a small neighborhood of the curve @xmath20 .",
    "in other words , if the signal has a well defined frequency at each time , then the tfd should reflect that .",
    "this is required for a ridge detection algorithm to work well with the tfd .",
    "the second requirement is that the tfd be relatively inexpensive to compute .",
    "this makes real - time analysis of interferometer data feasible .",
    "gonalves , flandrin and chassande - mottin@xcite have investigated the localization properties of various tfds when applied to binary inspiral chirp waveforms .",
    "they conclude that bilinear distributions have superior localization properties , and we therefore focus our attention on those . on the other hand",
    ", bilinear distributions can be computationally expensive , depending on the choice of kernel @xmath13 in ( [ eq : bidist ] ) .",
    "the question , then , is whether there is a kernel for which @xmath21 can be calculated efficiently .",
    "there is at least one choice of kernel which leads to a computationally efficient bilinear distribution with good localization properties : the _ wigner - ville distribution _",
    "( wvd)@xcite @xmath22 we will use the wvd , but note that it exhibits two features that might at first glance seem undesirable .",
    "both features are illustrated by considering a purely sinusoidal signal , @xmath23 .",
    "the wvd for this @xmath9 is @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{eq : wigsin}\\ ] ] first , note that @xmath3 does not have support only at the sinusoid s frequency @xmath25 , but also has an `` echo '' at @xmath26 .",
    "the sum of two sinusoids @xmath27 , has further echoes at @xmath28 .",
    "these echos are due to the bilinearity of the distribution .",
    "second , observe that this @xmath3 attains negative values at @xmath26 whenever @xmath29 is positive .",
    "thus , it is not entirely correct to think of the @xmath3 as the squared magnitude of the signal at a give time and frequency .    despite this behavior ,",
    "the wvd is well suited to our method .",
    "we wish to look for ridges in the tf plane .",
    "negative values away from these ridges are of no consequence .",
    "in fact , throughout this paper we will adopt the convention of setting negative values of @xmath3 to @xmath30 .",
    "also , since we are interested only in detection here , and not in extracting information about the signal , it does not matter how many ridges there are in the tfd , it matters only that their existence be highly correlated with the presence of a signal and that they be sharp .",
    "the wvd satisfies both these criteria .      while the discussion above has been couched in the language of functions of continuous variables , in practice it is necessary to calculate wvds from discretely sampled data @xmath31",
    "this appears to presents a minor dilemma , since ( [ eq : wigtrans ] ) contains expressions of the form @xmath32 , which when discretized become @xmath33 . for interferometer data ,",
    "this issue is easily dealt with , since the data will be significantly ( @xmath34 10 times ) oversampled .",
    "it is thus a simple matter to decimate these data to twice the time resolution required .",
    "we resample our simulated data so that @xmath35 accordingly .    a second issue ( also present in the continuous case )",
    "is that in practice @xmath9 is known only in a time interval @xmath36 .",
    "this means that @xmath32 is undefined for @xmath37 , and likewise @xmath38 for @xmath39 . in order to calculate ( [ eq : wigtrans ] )",
    "one must assign values to @xmath9 in the entire time interval @xmath40 .",
    "we therefore take @xmath41 in the intervals @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "having resolved these issues , it is straightforward to calculate the discrete analog of ( [ eq : wigtrans ] ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "this discrete distribution can be treated as a digital image , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively denoting the horizontal and vertical pixel number .",
    "the value of @xmath48 denotes the gray scale value , or equivalently height ( i.e. @xmath49 value ) , of the image in that pixel .",
    "it is easy to estimate the computational efficiency of the discrete wvd from ( [ eq : dwvd ] ) . for each value of @xmath46",
    ", one does a single multiplication ( of negligible cost ) and a fourier transform .",
    "the fast fourier transform costs @xmath50 floating point operations , and must be done for each of @xmath51 possible values of @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the cost of calculating the wvd is approximately @xmath52 .",
    "finally , note that for a data set with @xmath53 samples the resulting wvd has @xmath54 pixels ( @xmath51 time intervals by @xmath55 positive frequency bins ) .",
    "images from large data sets therefore quickly become unwieldy ; for example the data sets we used contained 4096 floats , leading to an image of @xmath56 pixels .",
    "we therefore averaged over 4 pixel intervals in time and 2 pixel intervals in frequency to obtain a more wieldy image size of @xmath57 .",
    "we end this section with an example of a discrete wigner - ville tfd .",
    "figure [ fig : wigex ] shows two wvds : one of simulated initial ligo noise and the other of a simulated bbhc waveform embedded in that same noise ( see section [ subsec : noise ] and appendix [ sec : n&s ] for details ) .",
    "a gravitational wave signal in interferometer data @xmath9 should produce a ridge in the tfd @xmath3 . therefore , to detect gws , a ridge detection algorithm ( or equivalently line detection algorithm if @xmath3 is represented as a gray - scale map as in fig .",
    "[ fig : wigex ] ) is required .",
    "fortunately , there are a number of ridge detection algorithms in the digital image processing and computer vision literature from which to choose .",
    "we use steger s second - derivative hysteresis - threshold algorithm @xcite .",
    "the essential idea of this scheme is simple .",
    "a ridge in a surface will have high curvature ( second derivative of @xmath3 ) in the direction perpendicular to the ridge .",
    "furthermore , the first derivative will vanish at the top of the ridge , since it is a local maximum .",
    "thus , ridges are identified as contiguous sets of point at which @xmath3 has a high - curvature local maximum .",
    "steger s algorithm , which identifies ridges in this way , has a number of steps .",
    "first the tfd @xmath3 is convolved with a 2-dimensional gaussian smoothing kernel , @xmath58 } , \\label{eq : stegkern}\\ ] ] where the dimensionless scale parameter @xmath59 allows the preferential detection of ridges of width @xmath60 or@xmath61 , and the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 are characteristic time and frequency scales of the tfd ( we used @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the time and frequency resolution of the digitized @xmath3 ) .",
    "one then takes the the first and second derivatives of the convolution @xmath66 with respect to both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the second derivatives are used to find the eigenvectors @xmath67 of the hessian matrix , @xmath68 at each point in the @xmath69 plane , the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue magnitude , @xmath70 , defines the line in the @xmath69 plane along which the second derivative of @xmath71 obtains its extremal value . for points on a ridge",
    ", these vectors will be normal to the curve described by the ridge in the @xmath69 plane .",
    "if the first derivative of @xmath71 vanishes in this direction , @xmath72 then the point may be on a ridge .",
    "we call such points `` potential ridge points '' .",
    "if all potential ridge points were included in ridges , one would find ridges everywhere in the tfd due to noise fluctuations , whether a signal was present or not . to avoid this , one thresholds on the value of the second derivative .",
    "however , thresholding presents conflicting requirements . on one hand ,",
    "if the threshold is too low , it will allow too many noise ridges to be detected .",
    "on the other hand ,",
    "if it is too high , portions of a genuine signal ridge may be missed due to deviations below the threshold caused by noise . to improve the detection of signal ridges while suppressing noise ridges , hysteresis thresholding is used .",
    "this means that there are two thresholds on the second derivative of @xmath21 , an upper threshold , which must be exceeded by any point at which a ridge can start , and a lower threshold , which must be exceeded by every point on the ridge .",
    "finally , ridges are identified as contiguous sets of potential ridge points which meet the hysteresis thresholding criteria .",
    "isolated potential ridge points are not defined to be ridges .",
    "note that small gaps in a ridge will be `` smeared out '' when the tfd is convolved with the gaussian kernel .",
    "thus , gaps of less than a few @xmath61 or @xmath73 are overlooked by this algorithm , which decreases the probability of noise fluctuations breaking a signal ridge into many smaller ridges .",
    "conversely , the minimum ridge length detected is also a few @xmath73 or @xmath61 , eliminating many shorter noise ridges .",
    "there are some further issues involved with implementing this algorithm on a digital image .",
    "when @xmath4 and @xmath5 are replaced by their discrete counterparts , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the distribution @xmath76 can be viewed as a piecewise constant function , having value @xmath48 in the rectangle @xmath77 \\times [ f_k-(\\delta f/2),f_k+ ( \\delta f/2)]$ ] , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and vanishing outside the image ( i.e. when @xmath80 or @xmath81 and when @xmath82 or @xmath83 ) .",
    "this piecewise constant function is then convolved with the _ continuous _ gaussian kernel .",
    "the convolution is equivalent to the summation @xmath84 where the convolution mask @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 rather than taking discrete derivatives of @xmath87 , the process can be made more efficient by using masks built from the derivatives of @xmath88 . by integrating ( [ eq : kernconv ] ) by parts",
    ", one may see that the same result can be derived by either process .",
    "however , while the derivatives of @xmath87 need to be calculated at each step , the derivatives of @xmath88 can be calculated just once .",
    "thus , along with ( [ eq : discmask ] ) , convolution masks are also made with @xmath88 replaced by its first and second derivatives with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "another issue addressed by steger s algorithm is the positioning of potential ridge points . for a digital image",
    ", the ridge will be composed of pixels within which the directional derivative ( [ eq : linecond ] ) vanishes .",
    "a one dimensional example illustrates the method used to determine whether ( [ eq : linecond ] ) is satisfied within a given pixel . denote the one - dimensional image function by @xmath89 .",
    "approximate @xmath89 at a point @xmath90 by its second order taylor series , @xmath91 where the coefficients are finite difference approximations of the derivatives of @xmath5 at @xmath90 and @xmath92 .",
    "the derivative of ( [ eq : taylorf ] ) vanishes at @xmath93 where @xmath94 this is within the @xmath95 pixel if and only if @xmath96 . in that case",
    ", @xmath97 is considered to be a potential ridge point and the @xmath95 pixel is a `` potential ridge pixel . ''",
    "one then joins ridge pixels ( as before ) to find the ridge .",
    "the generalization to two dimensions is discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have thus far described two of the three steps in our gw detection method : generation of wvds from interferometric data and the search for ridges ( signals ) in them .",
    "if all ridges corresponded to gw signals , the existence of a ridge would be an adequate detection statistic and these two steps would be sufficient .",
    "however , even after hysteresis thresholding ( see section [ sec : curve ] ) , stochastic detector noise will lead to spurious ridges in the wvd .",
    "this may be exacerbated if the noise is non - stationary and/or non - gaussian , in which case signal ridges and noise ridges might have very similar characteristics .",
    "a more powerful statistic can be devised by thresholding on ridge characteristics which are more strongly correlated with signal ridges than with noise ridges .",
    "of course , the more specific the threshold is to the signal , the less robust the detection technique will be .",
    "ridge length ( i.e. the number of pixels in a ridge ) is one characteristic which distinguishes signal ridges from noise ridges in stationary gaussian noise . since the noise is stochastic , it will produce a distribution of ridge lengths , with short ridges being more frequent than longer ones ( e.g. see fig .",
    "[ fig : fa ] ) .",
    "the ridge length of a signal is ( approximately ) determined by the signal s duration and frequency band .",
    "thus ridge length is more strongly correlated with signal ridges than noise ridges , and setting a minimum ridge length threshold can further improve the detection statistic .",
    "also , note that this thresholding is not so specific as to undermine the robustness of the tf method . for these reasons ,",
    "we use ridge length as a threshold .",
    "our complete tf detection method consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "construct the wigner - ville distribution @xmath3 of the detector output @xmath9 as per section [ sec : dist ] , 2 .",
    "search for ridges in the tf map @xmath3 using the steger s algorithm as per section [ sec : curve ] 3 .",
    "use a threshold on the length of the ridge as a detection criterion .",
    "the remainder of this article evaluates the performance of this method .",
    "the statistical performance of our tf method is measured by two probabilities : the probability of finding a signal when there is none , or _ false alarm probability _ and the probability of failing to find a signal when there is one , or _ false dismissal probability_.",
    "these probabilities depend on the details of the noise and the signal .",
    "our simulations were carried out with discretely sampled colored gaussian noise .",
    "this noise was produced using the _ numerical recipes _",
    "@xcite routine gasdev@xmath98 ( ) .",
    "we altered gasdev@xmath98 ( ) to use the ran2@xmath98 ( ) random number generator , since it produces much longer sequences of pseudo - random numbers than the default ran1@xmath98 ( ) routine .",
    "we divided the unit - variance white gaussian deviates produced by gasdev@xmath98 ( ) into two equal sets , which were used as the real and imaginary components of the complex valued frequency domain noise data , @xmath99 .",
    "finally , we colored the noise data by multiplying them by the square root of the initial ligo noise curve , @xmath100 .",
    "the specific @xmath101 we use is that of abramovici et al .",
    "@xcite as generated by the grasp routine noise_power@xmath98 ( ) with input parameter noise_file=``noise_ligo_init.dat '' @xcite .",
    "the signal data was obtained by sampling a continuous waveform developed specifically to test this algorithm .",
    "this waveform simulates the signal from an intermediate - mass coalescing black hole binary .",
    "these are expected to be important sources whose gravitational waveforms can not be calculated analytically in the initial ligo sensitivity band .",
    "they are thus ideal candidates for a robust detection method .",
    "our model is based on the predictions of flanagan and hughes .",
    "we wish to emphasize that it is _ not _ intended to be `` accurate '' in the sense required for optimal filtering : rather , it is constructed to have time , frequency and energy characteristics consistent with the assumptions of .",
    "thus , the performance of our tf method for these simulated signals should be indicative of its performance for actual coalescence signals .",
    "a detailed description of the model waveform and its derivation is presented in appendix [ sec : n&s ] .",
    "a typical waveform ( for a @xmath8 binary system ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbhwave ] .",
    "we analyzed simulated data in segments of @xmath102 samples each .",
    "the assumed sampling frequency was @xmath103hz ( we chose the sampling frequency of the ligo 40-meter prototype detector so that data from that detector could be easily analyzed ) .",
    "each segment therefore lasts for @xmath104 s , and the time interval between successive samples is @xmath105 s. samples in each segment are denoted by @xmath106 where @xmath46 takes the values between @xmath30 and @xmath107 .",
    "we denote the fourier transform of @xmath9 by @xmath108 and its discrete representation by @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath46 takes the value between @xmath30 ( dc ) and @xmath51 ( the nyquist frequency ) .",
    "we performed two types of simulations : one to determine false alarms probabilities ( the probability that a signal is detected when none is present ) and one to determine false dismissal probabilities ( the probability that no signal is detected when one is present ) . in every simulation ,",
    "the data stream contained gaussian noise , as described in subsection [ subsec : noise ] . to determine false alarm probabilities ,",
    "no simulated signals were added , so that @xmath111 . to determine false dismissal probabilities ,",
    "simulated gw signals were added to the noise .    as indicated in appendix",
    "[ sec : n&s ] , the angle averaged signals were generated in the time domain .",
    "we therefore took the fourier transform of the average signal , @xmath112 .",
    "the signal was normalized so that @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the one - sided power spectrum of the noise . the frequency domain data stream is then taken to be , @xmath115 where snr is the signal - to - noise ratio obtainable by matched filtering .",
    "since the wigner - ville distribution is computed from the time series representation of the detector output , it was necessary to transform @xmath116 into the time domain .",
    "however , the power spectrum spans such a large dynamic range that significant numerical errors arise if one simply takes the inverse fourier transform of @xmath117 .",
    "we therefore `` over - whitened '' the data , @xmath118 to reduce the ( time - domain ) dynamic range .",
    "this procedure has the added benefit that it emphasizes the frequencies in which the detector is most sensitive while suppressing the frequencies where the noise is large .",
    "we then took the inverse fourier transform of the over - whitened @xmath117 , and subsequently computed its wvd , @xmath119 , as per eq .",
    "( [ eq : wigtrans ] ) .",
    "this procedure produces discrete tfds , whose dimensions may be expressed in units of pixels . because of the undersampling involved in computing the discrete wvd ( see section [ sec : dist ] ) we computed @xmath48 at @xmath120 distinct offsets , giving the wvd a `` width '' of 2048 time pixels .",
    "also , the transform is constructed only at positive frequencies up to the nyquist frequency _",
    "after _ undersampling .",
    "thus , the wvd has a `` height '' of 1024 frequency pixels .",
    "the resulting tfds had @xmath121 pixels .",
    "this was too large for efficient computation , so we reduced the map size by averaging over every 4 time pixels and every 2 frequency pixels .",
    "the final discrete wvds had dimension @xmath122 pixels , each pixel having area @xmath123 .",
    "next , @xmath48 was passed through steger s line recognition algorithm .",
    "we used steger s implementation of this algorithm@xcite , which assumes that the pixels of the image ( distribution in our case ) are unsigned characters , taking integer values between 0 and 255 . to convert the floating point image @xmath48 to its unsigned character analog @xmath124 it was necessary to rescale the data to fit in this range without saturating it .",
    "the scaling factor was calculated as follows : the maximum floating point value of @xmath48 was found for each segment of noise data .",
    "the scaling factor was then chosen so that it scaled the average value of these maxima to the value 128 .",
    "once rescaled , the image was passed to steger s algorithm .",
    "the algorithm parameters we used were @xmath125 and second derivative ( hysteresis ) thresholds of @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "ideally , these values would be chosen by some optimization procedure , however , for this preliminary study they were selected `` by hand '' after extensive numerical experimentation .",
    "for each map , the line recognition algorithm returns a list of ridges detected and their lengths .",
    "our detection statistic was the length of the longest ridge in the map .",
    "thus , a threshold value was chosen , and if this value was equaled or exceeded by the longest curve in a given map , a signal was said to have been detected in that map .",
    "for instance , if one chooses a threshold ridge length 30 pixels , a signal is said to have been detected in any map which contains a ridge whose length is 30 pixels or longer .",
    "our goal is an algorithm which has an acceptable false alarm rate @xmath128 . in our case",
    ", this means determining a ridge length which is not equaled or exceeded in maps containing only noise more than once in every @xmath129 seconds . to compute this threshold , we simulated noise from an ensemble of statistically independent identical detectors . in our simulation ,",
    "the ensemble consisted of approximately @xmath130 detectors , which corresponds to analyzing @xmath131 seconds or about 196 hours of simulated data .    for each member of the ensemble",
    ", we computed a wvd .",
    "we then searched for ridges in the wvd using steger s algorithm and determined the length of the longest ridge .",
    "ridges were found in 106 of the @xmath130 wvds , or about 1 out of every @xmath132 maps . in those maps",
    "in which ridges were found , the length of the longest ridge ranged from 7 to 68 pixels . the relative frequency with which the longest ridge had a length @xmath133 pixels",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath134 in figure [ fig : fa ] .",
    "based on this simulation we chose a ridge length threshold of 30 pixels .",
    "this threshold produces a false alarm probability of about @xmath135 , or a false alarm rate of about one every @xmath136 hours in a single detector .",
    "more interesting is the rate at which false alarms occur simultaneously in two uncorrelated detectors .",
    "this coincidence rate is proportional to the coincidence window @xmath137 , i.e. the time interval within which the same signal can be seen by both detectors .",
    "a natural lower limit for @xmath137 is the light crossing time between detectors , @xmath138 , since the time interval between the arrival of a single signal at the first detector and the last detector can be up to @xmath138 .",
    "however , other considerations may set a larger @xmath137 for a given algorithm , leading to a higher coincident false alarm rate .    for the ligo 4 km detectors",
    ", @xmath138 is approximately 10 ms .",
    "as implemented , the tf method did not resolve time - of - arrival to this accuracy , because we did not distinguish when in the 400 ms data segment the signal arrived .",
    "the coincidence window is therefore 400 ms , which corresponds to a coincident false alarm rate of approximately one 400 ms/(3.4 hr@xmath139 , or about one per 12 years .",
    "however , recall that the time resolution of the wvd is less than 0.0008 s. furthermore , recall that steger",
    "s algorithm identifies the position of ridges in the image ( in fact , this feature was implemented in our code although we did not use it ) .",
    "thus , at no extra computational cost , one could set @xmath140 10 ms .",
    "the tf method can therefore easily achieve a coincident false alarm rate of @xmath141 , or about one every @xmath142 years .",
    "the false dismissal probability depends on the nature and strength of the signal in the data . we ve estimated these probabilities for simulated bbhc waveforms ( section [ subsec : noise ] ) .",
    "we used signals with snrs ( as measured by optimal filters ) in the range 7 to 14 . to demonstrate the robustness of this tf method we selected various coalescence waveforms corresponding to different binary system masses .",
    "we confined ourselves to the ( total system ) mass range @xmath143 to @xmath144 . in this range",
    "the merger phase , for which the waveform can not be calculated analytically , sweeps through the frequency band of maximum sensitivity for initial ligo detectors , and dominates the detectable signal .",
    "these are therefore masses for which robust methods will be most useful .",
    "figure [ fig : dis_vs_mass ] shows false dismissal probabilities as a function of binary mass at snrs of 10 , 12 and 14 .    at an snr of 14 the false dismissal rates are acceptable throughout the tested mass range . at an snr of 10 ,",
    "however , more than 20% of signals are missed by our detection algorithm for system masses @xmath145 .",
    "this is because as the mass of a system decreases , the proportion of the snr which is attributable to the inspiral phase increases , as does the duration of the observable portion of the inspiral .",
    "thus , the snr of the signal is spread through a larger region of the tf map , leading to lower ridges and hence a loss of detectability .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dis_vs_snr ] we plot the false dismissal probabilities versus the snr for signals from @xmath146 and @xmath144 binary systems .",
    "again , one sees in this figure that high mass systems are more readily detected .",
    "false dismissal probabilities for every system mass decrease with signal - to - noise ratio as expected .",
    "all our simulations were carried out on a 48 node beowulf ( parallel ) computer comprised 300 mhz alpha 21164 machines @xcite .",
    "this computer can analyze 47 segments of data simultaneously ( the 48th machine is used to coordinate the calculation ) .",
    "we found that we could apply our tf method to approximately @xmath147 data points per second ( about twice the sampling rate of the simulated data ) .    for initial ligo",
    ", the frequency band of maximum sensitivity is projected to be below a few hundred hz@xcite .",
    "sampling rates of 1024 hz should therefore be sufficient to contain all signals detectable with this tf method .",
    "thus , even modest parallel computing facilities could implement this method in real time for initial ligo data .",
    "optimal filtering has dominated the interferometric gw data analysis literature . this is because when one seeks signals of nearly exactly known form in stationary noise with known spectral density , optimal filters are the most sensitive linear filters .",
    "however , it is clear that there are sources of gravitational radiation that are not understood well enough to predict their signal waveforms . for such sources ,",
    "matched filtering will not be a suitable detection method .",
    "it is therefore necessary to develop methods which can detect signals from poorly modeled or even unmodeled sources in interferometric gw data .",
    "we have demonstrated that time - frequency methods may provide a tool for detecting such sources .",
    "our method , with the parameters discussed above , produced an initial ligo false alarm rate of @xmath148 , which corresponds to coincident false alarm rate in two detectors of @xmath149 .",
    "our simulations also show that we reliably detect the postulated bbhc waveforms for binaries of various masses injected into the data at a variety of optimal filter signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "for instance , we detect 80% of signals with snrs ranging from @xmath150 for higher mass binaries ( @xmath1 ) to @xmath151 for lower mass binaries ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "these numbers are within a factor of two of those for optimal filtering of stellar mass binary inspirals , where for two detectors the detection threshold is usually taken to be an snr of @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , this method is implementable in real time with a realistic computing budget .",
    "while this method shows considerable promise , there are still a number of issues which must be addressed in order to determine how useful tf methods will be in general :    utilization - : :    one might use tf methods as a filter to identify data which should be    analyzed for the presence of signals using other techniques ( i.e. in    an hierarchical search ) , for detecting the signals themselves , or as a    method for characterizing detector noise .",
    "this paper only addresses    signal detection .",
    "choice of algorithm - : :    we have presented only one of many tf methods that could be    implemented . we have used the wigner - ville distribution and steger s    ridge detection algorithm , however there are a number of other tfds    ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and ridge detection algorithms ( e.g. hough    transforms@xcite or the curve and edge detection algorithms    cited in the introduction of @xcite ) which might prove suitable . as a    detection statistic , energy along ridges , total ridge length in a map ,    or `` bunching '' of ridges might provide better detection statistics    than maximum ridge length .",
    "optimization - : :    we have made heuristic choices for operating values of the smoothing    parameter @xmath59 and the second derivative thresholds in    steger s algorithm .",
    "it would be desirable to have a process which ,    given a specific type of gw signal , optimizes these parameters . implementation - : :    it is unlikely that a single tf method is sufficiently robust to    detect all types of unmodeled sources , which means that a set of tf    methods should be used .",
    "it is also possible that tf methods are    optimally implemented hierarchically .",
    "for example , one might have two    detection statistics ; one with an unacceptably high false alarm rate    but low computational cost and another with prohibitive computational    cost but a low false alarm rate . by applying the second statistic only    to those tf maps in which a signal is detected with the first    statistic , one could achieve both computational efficiency and    acceptable false alarm rates .",
    "comparison with other techniques - : :    we do not know how tf methods compare to other techniques . signals    that are optimal for tf detection produce regions of high density in    the tfd . for our simulated signals , this high density region spans    relatively short time scales ( @xmath154 s )",
    ". they might    therefore be equally well detected with much simpler time - series    thresholding techniques such as the one described in @xcite .",
    "we have    investigated this possibility by comparing each datum used in our tf    simulations to a threshold .",
    "we chose the threshold to produce the same    false alarm rate as obtained with the tf method .",
    "this technique    produced a false dismissal rate of about twice that of the tf method .",
    "however , it is unknown whether a more sophisticated time - series    threshold or a different statistic such as the excess power statistic    @xcite would prove superior to the tf method .",
    "there is one further issue which pertains to all robust methods . in order to detect a signal of unspecified form in noise",
    ", the noise must be well characterized .",
    "we have assumed gaussian noise in this paper .",
    "it is uncertain at this time to what extent this assumption is valid , however it is known that noise from the ligo 40 m prototype contains a significant non - gaussian component .",
    "the extent to which this component can be identified and removed ( perhaps with the aid of tf methods themselves ) is an issue that will only be fully resolved once the relevant interferometer data becomes available .",
    "clearly , there is a much work to be done .",
    "moreover , with interferometric detectors scheduled to begin taking data in approximately a years time , there is little time in which to do it . in an effort to expedite the resolution of the issues listed above , we have made our tf computer code available as part of the latest release of grasp@xcite .",
    "however , the results of this preliminary investigation are encouraging . with the resolution of these issues ,",
    "tf methods promise to be useful tools for the detection of gw signals in interferometric data .",
    "we would like to thank bruce allen for many useful discussions and suggestions .",
    "we also thank patrick brady , eric chassande - mottin , jolien creighton , anna flanagan , scott hughes and alan wiseman for their helpful suggestions , and carsten steger for suggesting his algorithm and supplying his c code to us .",

    "the signal waveforms we used in our false dismissal simulations are based on the description of binary black hole coalescence ( bbhc ) signals in flanagan and hughes ( fh ) .",
    "they consist of three consecutive components : an inspiral component , a merger component , and a quasi - normal ringdown component .",
    "the division into these components is somewhat arbitrary . roughly speaking :    *",
    "the inspiral component describes the evolution of the binary system up to the `` innermost stable circular orbit '' ( isco ) .",
    "this component is well modeled for bbh systems of @xmath155@xcite , but there is some doubt whether it is known well enough for optimal filtering for binaries of total mass @xmath156@xcite . *",

    ", it should resemble it enough to determine whether our tf method can detect bbh waveforms for intermediate - mass systems .",
    "the first step in our construction of a merger waveform estimate is to assume a form of @xmath226 continuity of the @xmath227 and @xmath228 with both the inspiral waveform that proceeds it and the quasi - normal ringdown waveform that follows constitutes four conditions on @xmath229 : @xmath230 where the last equation follows from the fact that the @xmath165 is constant . to satisfy these four conditions",
