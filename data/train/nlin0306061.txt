    "dissipationless shock waves have been experimentally observed or their existence has been theoretically predicted in various nonlinear media  water @xcite , plasma @xcite , optical fibers @xcite , lattices @xcite .",
    "in contrast to usual dissipative shocks where combined action of nonlinear and dissipation effects leads to sharp jumps of the wave intensity , accompanied by abrupt changes of other wave characteristics , in dissipationless shocks the viscosity effect is negligibly small compared with the dispersive one , and , instead of intensity jumps , the combined action of nonlinear and dispersion effects leads to formation oscillatory wave region ( for review see e.g. @xcite ) . since intrinsic discreteness of a solid state system gives origin to strong dispersion , which can dominate dissipative effects in wave phenomena , it is of considerable interest to investigate details of formation of dissipationless shocks in lattices .    as a model , in the present paper we choose the general discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( gdnls ) equation @xmath0 introduced by salerno @xcite .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) turned out to be an important model not only because of its property to provide a one - parametric transition between an integrable ablowitz - ladik ( al ) model and the so - called discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ) , but also because of a number of physical application for a review of which we refer to @xcite .",
    "obviously , ( [ eq1 ] ) has a constant amplitude solution @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that in a small amplitude , @xmath4 , and long wave ( so that the discrete site index @xmath5 can be replaced by a continuous coordinate @xmath6 ) limit , evolution of small amplitude perturbations with respect to this constant background , @xmath7 is governed by the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation for the amplitude @xmath8 : @xmath9a_{xxx}=0\\label{eq3}\\ ] ] which is written in the reference system moving with velocity @xmath10 of linear waves in dispersionless limit .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. @xcite ) that if the initial pulse is strong enough , so that the nonlinear term dominates over the dispersive one at the initial stage of the pulse evolution , then the dissipationless shock wave develops after the wave breaking point .",
    "the theory of such waves , described by the kdv equation , is well developed ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "existence of the respective shock waves for model ( [ eq1 ] ) has been predicted analytically and observed in numerical simulations in @xcite .",
    "moreover , as it is shown in @xcite a nonlinear schrdinger equation of a rather general type can bear `` kdv - type '' shock waves . in this context the results presented below in the present paper although being mostly related to model ( [ eq1 ] ) display some general characteristic features of a lattice of a nonlinear schrdinger type .",
    "the coefficients of ( [ eq3 ] ) depend on two parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 and can vanish at special choice of these parameters , so the kdv equation looses its applicability for these values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "physically acceptable values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are limited by the inequalities @xmath13 and this region of the @xmath14 plane is depicted in fig .  1",
    ".    [ fig0 ]    along the line @xmath15 the coefficient before the nonlinear term in ( [ eq3 ] ) vanishes .",
    "this means that implied in derivation of the kdv equation approximation limited to only quadratic nonlinearities fails and higher nonlinearities have to be taken into account for accurate description of the wave dynamics .",
    "hence , one may expect that the modified kdv ( mkdv ) equation with cubic nonlinearity arises for values of @xmath12 and @xmath11 related by ( [ eq5 ] )",
    ".    along the line @xmath16 the coefficient before the dispersion term in ( [ eq3 ] ) vanishes what means that higher order dispersion effects have to be taken into account . in this case",
    "one may expect that evolution equation for @xmath8 contains quadratic nonlinear term and linear dispersion term with fifth - order space derivative of @xmath8 .",
    "the most interesting point corresponds to the values @xmath17 when both nonlinear and dispersion coefficients vanish . since eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath1 coincides with the completely integrable ablowitz - ladik equation , one may expect that in a small amplitude approximation this equation with the parameters equal to ( [ eq7 ] ) reduces again to a completely integrable equation .",
    "the kdv equation ( [ eq3 ] ) with @xmath1 is valid for all interval @xmath18 except for some vicinity of the point @xmath19 , and therefore one can suppose that at the point ( [ eq3 ] ) one has to obtain the second equation of the kdv hierarchy kdv(2 ) in which the higher order nonlinear and dispersion effects play the dominant role .",
    "the aim of this paper is two - fold . at first , in sec .",
    "[ small_amplitude ] we derive the evolution equations for the whole region ( [ eq4 ] ) and show that along the line ( [ eq5 ] ) the small - amplitude approximation reduces to the mkdv equation ( sec  [ mkdv ] ) , along the line ( [ eq6 ] ) to a nonlinear equation with the dispersion of the fifth - order ( sec  [ kawa ] ) , and at the point ( [ eq7 ] ) to the kdv(2 ) equation ( sec  [ kdv2 ] ) .",
    "the last result sheds some new light on the nature of higher equations of the kdv hierarchy  they arise as small amplitude approximations to completely integrable equations , if lower orders of nonlinear and dispersion contributions vanish at some values of the parameters of the equation under consideration .",
    "the second aim of the paper is to develop a theory of shock waves ( sec  [ shock ] ) for the mkdv ( sec  [ shock_mkdv])and kdv(2 ) ( sec  [ shock_kdv2 ] ) equations analogous to that developed earlier for the kdv equation .",

    "we expand @xmath26 and @xmath27 into the taylor series around @xmath6 , introduce scaling indexes @xmath28 and demand that in the reference frame moving with velocity ( [ eq10 ] ) of linear waves the lowest quadratic nonlinearity has the same order of magnitude as the second term in the expansion ( [ eq9 ] ) of the dispersion relation , @xmath29 which yield @xmath30 thus , the scaled variables have the form @xmath31 and @xmath8 and @xmath32 should be looked for in the form of expansions @xmath33 then in the lowest order in expansion of eq .",

    "this observation suggests that the property of complete integrability preserves in framework of singular perturbation scheme , which is a known phenomenon ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". then higher equations of some hierarchy may arise as approximate equations .",
    "this happens if at some values of the parameters of the underline completely integrable problem nonlinearity and , hence , dispersion of lower equations of the hierarchy vanish .",

    "this means that near the wave breaking point one can not neglect the dispersion effects .",
    "if we take them into account , then the multi - valued region is replaced by the oscillatory region of the solution of the full equation .",
    "this oscillatory region is called dissipationless shock wave and its analytical description is the aim of this section .",
    "existing theory of dissipationless shock waves can be applied in principle to completely integrable equations only . among equations derived in the preceding section , however , fifth - order kdv equation ( [ eq24 ] )",
    "does not belong to this class .",

    "we also bear in mind that the dissipationless shock waves of the kdv equation are already described in literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we shall not consider this equation here and concentrate our attention on the completely integrable models .",
    "the analytical approach is based on the idea that the oscillatory region of the dissipationless shock wave can be represented as a modulated periodic solution of the equation under consideration . if the parameters defining the solution change little on a distance of one wavelength and during the time of order of one period , one can distinguish two scales of time in this problem  fast oscillations of the wave and slow change of the parameters of the wave",
    ". then equations which govern a slow evolution of the parameters can be averaged over fast oscillations what leads to the so - called whitham equations @xcite and their solution subject to appropriate initial and boundary conditions describes evolution of the dissipationless shock wave .",
    "this approach was suggested in @xcite and now it is well developed for the kdv equation case ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the results of this theory can be applied to shocks in gdnls equation when it is reduced to the kdv equation ( [ eq3 ] ) or ( [ eq15 ] ) . since this theory",
