    "determining the phase structure of gauge theories of fundamental interactions is crucial in order to be able to select relevant extensions of the standard model of particle interactions for particle physics , dark matter @xcite , cosmology @xcite and quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "in particular it is interesting to elucidate the perturbative and non - perturbative physics of non - abelian gauge theories with and without fundamental scalars as function of the number of flavors , colors and matter representation .",
    "the relevant points to address are :    * determine the regions of conformality of a given gauge theory as function of the couplings , number of flavors and matter representation . *",
    "determine whether near the conformal boundary between a conformally broken and conformally restored symmetry the theory _ walks _ or _ jumps _ ? walking dynamics",
    "@xcite requires that the physical observables of the theory , in the broken phase , feel the presence of the conformal phase .",
    "this must happen at least in a region of the parameter space of the theory near the phase transition . jumping dynamics @xcite refers instead to the logical possibility that the theory in the broken phase displays no signs of a nearby , in the parameter space , conformal region .",
    "jumping dynamics is associated to a first order conformal phase transition while walking dynamics to a second order or higher transition .",
    "*   jumping and walking dynamics could be realized physically in different ways .",
    "for example walking arises naturally when an ultraviolet fixed point ( uvfp ) and an infrared one ( irfp ) smoothly merge .",
    "the full beta function of the theory near this merger can be modeled by the product of two zeros .",
    "this mechanism also underlies the conjectured miransky scaling @xcite describing how the intrinsic scale of the theory vanishes as we approach the conformal boundary . on the other hand",
    "the ratio of two zeros in the beta function leads naturally to jumping dynamics @xcite .",
    "the problem is therefore to establish which mechanism underlies either walking or jumping dynamics in a given gauge theory .",
    "* once the kind of the conformal transition has been established one needs to determine the physical properties of the theory .",
    "these are , for example , the anomalous dimensions of the fermion mass operator and the particle spectrum . *",
    "if the conformal transition is of walking type another question arises : what is the actual range of the parameter space of the theory supporting walking , e.g. the walking window as function of the number of flavors and colors ?",
    "to help answer some of the points above it is , therefore , relevant to construct calculable examples such as the two dimensional toy model investigated in @xcite . here , however , we are interested in investigating four dimensional gauge theories allowing us to address all , or part , of the questions above @xcite in perturbation theory .",
    "since we are not concerned with the hierarchy problem , this is obviously true also for the toy model studied in @xcite , we consider theories featuring also fundamental scalars besides fermionic matter as done in @xcite .",
    "we start by introducing the gauge theory template @xcite allowing us to investigate conformal dynamics and its breaking within perturbation theory .",
    "the gauge theory we consider is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with the addition of a meson - like scalar degree of freedom as well as an adjoint weyl fermion .",
    "this model has a large number of global symmetries in common with ordinary qcd and allows us , at the two - loop level , and in the veneziano limit , to establish the existence of several fixed points of which one is all directions stable in the infrared .",
    "a relevant feature of the model is that the infrared stable fixed point can be lost , within the perturbatively trustable regime , by either the merging with a non - trivial ultraviolet fixed point when varying the underlying number of quark species or via spontaneous condensation of a scalar field due to perturbative quantum corrections @xcite .",
    "interestingly these two mechanisms associated to the loss of an infrared fixed point can be investigated in great detail within the same gauge theory .",
    "the merger phenomenon @xcite , as we shall see , leads to the expected slow running of the coupling constant towards the infrared also known as _ walking _ dynamics pioneered by holdom @xcite and also investigated in @xcite .",
    "the fixed points merge when the number of flavors reaches a critical value . due to the calculable nature of the model we can provide a clear realization of the miransky scaling @xcite and walking dynamics .",
    "the phenomenon of merging fixed points unveils itself here when going to the second order in perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , to the first order conformality can be lost , in our model , only because of the quantum corrections inducing spontaneous condensation of the scalar degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "other quantities for walking dynamics such as the anomalous dimension of the fermion masses will also be determined precisely .",
    "in section [ model ] we review the model and the one - loop results . in section",
    "[ bol ] we setup the two - loop beta function analysis and discuss the fixed point structure .",
    "we also show that the ir stable fixed point merges with an uv fixed point as we decrease the number of flavors within the perturbative regime .",
    "we then move to section [ phys - merger ] where we investigate in detail the physics of the merger . here",
    "we determine precisely the conformal window as function of the number of flavors .",
    "remarkably we are even able to determine the precise region of walking .",
    "we show that the miransky scaling emerges naturally in this model .",
    "we finally compute that anomalous dimension of the mass operator both for the uv and ir non - trivial fixed points .",
    "we briefly conclude in section [ conclu ] while in the appendix [ full - betas ] we provide the full beta function and anomalous dimension of the fermion mass operator of the theory at two loops and for any number of colors .",
    "we want to investigate the dynamics of the following gauge - yukawa theory : @xmath1- u_1 ( { \\text{tr}}[h ^\\dagger h])^2 -u_2{\\text{tr}}(h ^\\dagger h ) ^2 \\ .",

    "we show the dependence of the irfp on @xmath14 to better appreciate its perturbative nature .",
    "] * although there is a perturbatively stable irfp not all the renormalization group ( rg ) trajectories will be able to end on it because of the presence of elementary mesons .",
    "in fact , the scalar potential can be unstable against a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking phase transition induced by the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is not encoded in the perturbative running of the couplings .",
    "a critical boundary ( separatrix ) was discovered in the parameter space of the theory separating the stable region from the unstable one .",
    "this is shown as a two - dimensional section of the parameter space in fig .",
    "[ rgflow1 ] , where it is assumed that the gauge and yukawa couplings have quasi - reached the fp .",
    "the other couplings , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are imagined to have quasi - reached the fixed point for ] * in the stable region , i.e. where the cw does not lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking , the fp is reached and the theory exhibits large distance conformality . in the unstable region the effective potential develops a non - trivial minimum leading to chiral symmetry breaking to its maximal diagonal subgroup .",
    "the resulting perturbative spectrum consists of heavy fermions , heavy scalars , massless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons and a pseudo - ng boson associated with spontaneous breaking of the dilatation symmetry .",
    "the gauge sector and @xmath13-field are not affected by the symmetry breaking and emerge as a low - energy super yang - mills theory of which the condensate is computable nonperturbatively .",
    "the scale of the condensate / confinement of this remaining low energy theory can be shown to be exponentially lighter than any other generated mass scale of the theory . *",
    "it has also been shown that the pseudo - ng boson , associated to dilatonic invariance , is the dilaton state of the theory at the quantum level .",
    "its mass , to one loop order , was computed to be : @xmath17\\exp \\left ( -\\frac{1}{2 } - \\frac{4z_2 ^ 2\\ln(4z_2)-xa_h^2 \\ln(x a_h)}{4 z_2 ^ 2 - xa_h^2 } \\right ) \\ , \\label{md}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the scale at which the ( bare ) lagrangian is defined and it is approximately the mass scale of the other heavy states .",
    "it was shown that @xmath19 can be made much lighter than the heavy mass scale by tuning @xmath20 , since the heavy states acquire tree level masses proportional to @xmath16 and @xmath21 .",
    "this tuning corresponds to rg trajectories closer and closer to the separatrix . a large scale separation between the different states of the theory is therefore obtained in the chirally broken region by tuning the theory closer to the separatrix .",
    "we have thus constructed an explicit perturbative realization of conformal and near conformal dynamics .",
    "however , this realization differs from the one in qcd , since it is perturbative and furthermore the tuning needed to go in and out of the conformal window is in the couplings instead of the number of quark flavors .",
    "furthermore , the primary condensation phenomenon involves a scalar field rather than the quark condensate . as we shall see in the following sections ,",
    "this situation becomes more interesting when two loop corrections are included .",
    "it is interesting to go beyond one - loop since we know that higher order analyses often reveal several new important features @xcite not present at the lowest order .",
    "in fact , by carrying the analysis one step further in the perturbative expansion we will discover that the irfp can also disappear , within the perturbative regime , by merging with a new ultraviolet fixed point as we decrease the number of quark flavors .",
    "the mechanism behind the loss of conformality is very different from the case in which this occurs via scalar condensation induced by quantum corrections . in this case",
    ", it is reasonable to expect the quarks to condense first and induce the scalar condensate .",
    "of course , we have to work in the region of the parameter space where the cw potential does not lead to a scalar condensate .",
    "we have checked , by an explicit computation , that such a region of couplings exists .",
    "we now therefore present the beta functions and their fixed point ( fp ) structure at two loops .",
    "the two - loop beta functions have been derived using the formalism of @xcite .",

    "we focus our attention on the two loop fate of this irfp as function of the number of flavors , i.e. @xmath14 . to help the reader we provide its explicit two loop dependence on the number of flavors in fig.[2loopfp ] .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the irfp merges at a critical number of flavors with a new ultraviolet ( uv)fp appearing at two loops .",
    "interestingly the uvfp appears to be perturbative in the same range of @xmath14 in which the irfp exists .",
    "moreover , the merger occurs at @xmath30 which is quite close to the asymptotically free boundary for which the perturbative expansion is valid .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that higher loop effects will not qualitatively affect this picture .",
    "this means that we discovered a conformal window as function of number of flavors accessible in perturbation theory .",

    "we have already discussed that the irfp as function of the number of flavors merges with the uv one , and argued that this happened within the perturbative regime of the theory .",
    "it is therefore timely to start a careful perturbative investigation of the physical properties of the theory around the lower boundary of the conformal window delimited by the merging of the irfp and uvfp occurring at @xmath30 corresponding to a critical number of flavors @xmath31 .",

    "<S> near conformal dynamics is employed in different extensions of the standard model of particle interactions as well as in cosmology . many of its interesting properties are either conjectured or determined using model computations . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a relevant four dimensional gauge theory template allowing us to investigate such dynamics perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge theory we consider is quantum chromodynamics with the addition of a meson - like scalar degree of freedom as well as an adjoint weyl fermion .    at the two - loop level , and in the veneziano limit </S>",
    "<S> , we firmly establish the existence of several fixed points of which one is all directions stable in the infrared . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature of the model is that this fixed point is lost , within the perturbatively trustable regime , by merging with another fixed point when varying the number of quark flavors . </S>",
    "<S> we show the emergence of the miransky scaling and determine its properties . </S>",
    "<S> we are also able to determine the walking region of the theory which turns out to be , at large number of colors , about 12% of the conformal window . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we determine highly relevant quantities for near conformal dynamics such as the anomalous dimension of the fermion masses . </S>",
