    "we will assume that bosons with small masses exist and calculate how they spin down black holes .",
    "in practice , our results can be used to rule out bosons with certain masses and self - interactions , whenever a spinning black hole is observed .",
    "if , on the other hand , an otherwise unexplainable lack of spin of black holes in a certain mass interval is discovered , it can be interpreted as indirect evidence for a light boson @xcite .",
    "as explained by zeldovich @xcite , rotating absorbing body ( say a black hole ) amplifies waves of frequency @xmath0 and angular momentum projection onto the spin axis @xmath1 , provided @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the angular velocity of the body .",
    "this leads to the so - called superradiant instability of massive boson fields in kerr metric @xcite .    in planck units , for the kerr hole of mass @xmath4 and dimensionless spin",
    "parameter @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , the fastest growing mode of the klein - gordon field @xmath7 of mass @xmath8 is the 2p state , with the growth rate [ det ]",
    "_ 1=am^8 ^ 9 .",
    "if the number of e - foldings in the black hole lifetime @xmath9 is large ( @xmath10 amplifies the field from zero - point oscillations to the planck scale values @xmath11 ) , the exponential growth has to be terminated by the gravitational or @xmath7 radiation .",
    "the @xmath7 radiation dominates if the nonlinear scale of the @xmath7 field @xmath12 . with this assumption , we can study the saturation of the instability by the nonlinearities of the @xmath7 field using the unperturbed kerr metric and neglecting gravitational radiation .",
    "the following ( rather involved ) saturation scenario has originally been seen in numerical simulations .",
    "the numerical results are presented in  [ num ] . here",
    "we    * \\(a ) give a qualitative picture * \\(b ) derive schrodinger equation for nonrelativistic nonlinear superradiance * \\(c ) estimate and then * \\(d ) calculate the mode amplitudes at saturation and the resulting black hole spindown rate .",
    "the crucial feature of our scenario is the simultaneous presence and interaction of the 2p and 3d bound states . as relevant modes",
    "are approximately nonrelativistic , they can be analyzed in the schrodinger equation approximation .",
    "both cubic and quartic self - interactions of the @xmath7 field then give the same @xmath13 nonlinearity in the schrodinger equation .",
    "let @xmath14 , @xmath15 be the number of particles in the 2p@xmath16 and 3d@xmath17 states .",
    "the dimensionless nonrelativistic energies ( frequencies ) of the modes are @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "mn_m^1/2e^-i_mt+im be the corresponding wave functions .    in the beginning , more precisely , after a few e - foldings , @xmath20 .",
    "the leading self - interaction is then @xmath21 .",
    "this nonlinearity only reshapes the potential well , without affecting the fate of the instability .",
    "the next to leading order interaction is @xmath22 .",
    "this interaction excites a forced @xmath23 oscillation of the wave function .",
    "the frequency of this oscillation is negative , @xmath24 , so the oscillation is trapped . as @xmath23 , the forced oscillation has a finite amplitude at small @xmath25 and is therefore damped by the black hole .",
    "the damping reduces the number of particles @xmath26 , without reducing the angular momentum @xmath27 .",
    "schematically ( with arbitrary normalizations ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the detweiler s growth rate ( [ det ] ) . as",
    "the forced oscillation amplitude is small , the number of particles and the angular momentum are approximately equal to @xmath30    it follows that @xmath31 we see that in the presence of @xmath14 , the mode @xmath15 becomes linearly unstable with the growth rate @xmath32",
    ". formally , the system asymptotes to @xmath33 .",
    "so , even though we start with @xmath20 , the nonlinear interactions will try to reverse the situation .",
    "however , as @xmath15 approaches @xmath14 , we must also include the interaction @xmath34 .",
    "this forces the @xmath35 oscillation , which , importantly , is unbound : 2_2-_1>0 the @xmath35 oscillation carries particles and angular momentum to infinity .",
    "again schematically , treating eqs.([n ] , [ l ] ) as the definitions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we have @xmath36 giving @xmath37    equations ( [ sk1 ] , [ sk2 ] ) have a single equilibrium point @xmath38 , which is stable for all @xmath39 . at equilibrium ,",
    "particles and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole .",
    "then some particles are returned to the black hole and some particles , carrying all the extracted angular momentum , are radiated to infinity .",
    "to proceed , we need schrodinger equation describing nonrelativistic nonlinear superradiance . consider klein - gordon equation with cubic and quartic nonlinearities in the field potential : v=^2 ^ 2+^3+^4 , where @xmath40 is the nonlinear scale of the field @xmath7 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath41 , @xmath42 are dimensionless .",
    "for example , @xmath43 , @xmath44 give the first expansion terms of the axion potential .    for @xmath45 ,",
    "the growing mode and all other modes participating in the nonlinear saturation of the instability are nonrelativistic .",
    "the nonlinear klein - gordon equation then reduces to the nonlinear schrodinger equation .",
    "namely , define @xmath46 by = ^-1/2e^-it+^-1/2^*e^it .",
    "then , with newtonian gravitational field , we have [ sch0 ] i=-^2 --||^2 . here",
    "= , with the last equality redefining the nonlinear scale @xmath40 ( we do not consider the degenerate case @xmath47 ) . in the axion case ,",
    "@xmath48 , meaning that the self - interaction is attractive .    as it is , eq.([sch0 ] ) does not have any growing or decaying modes , because the near - horizon effects disappear in the nonrelativistic approximation .",
    "but , as will become clear from what follows , all we need for our calculation is : ( i ) correct growth rates for the 2p mode with @xmath49 , ( ii ) correct decay rates for the @xmath23 modes , ( iii ) negligibly small growth / decay rates for @xmath50 .",
    "this can be achieved by adding a rotating absorber to eq.([sch0 ] ) : @xmath51    here @xmath52 is the decay rate , @xmath53 is the radius of the absorber , @xmath3 is the angular velocity .",
    "so far these parameters are arbitrary .",
    "however , only with b=()^1/2 m ,   = ,   = 6()^3/2 , the first - order perturbation theory growth rates of eq.([se ] ) , @xmath54 coincide with those given by detweiler ( for all @xmath23 and for 2p in the limit of small @xmath55 ; note that our @xmath56 is the standard principle quantum number , with @xmath57 ) .      to convert the schematics of  [ qual ] into estimates",
    ", we note that the schrodinger equation ( [ se ] ) gives the length scales of the modes r~(m)^-1 ^ -1 , frequencies ~^-1r^-2~(m)^2 , amplitudes , in terms of the particle numbers @xmath26 , ~n^1/2r^-3/2 , and nonlinearly induced amplitudes _ ind ~^-1 ^ 3~()^2(m)^5/2 ^ 3/2n^3/2 .",
    "the induced @xmath58 mode is damped by the absorber ( the black hole ) at the rate ~-b^3_ind^2 , giving = -_0n_1 ^ 2n_2 , _ 0=(m)^7()^4 , where @xmath59 is a dimensionless coefficient to be calculated in the next section .",
    "the induced @xmath35 mode is radiated at the rate ~-vr^2_ind^2 , where the velocity is v~(^-1)^1/2~m , giving = -_3n_1n_2 ^ 2 , _ 3=(m)^4()^4 , where @xmath60 is a dimensionless coefficient to be calculated in the next section .",
    "we thus have @xmath61 giving @xmath62    the saturated particle numbers are n_1=()^1/2 ,  n_2=()^1/2 .",
