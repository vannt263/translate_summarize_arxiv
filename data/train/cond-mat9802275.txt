    "low - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets exhibit many remarkable properties , and the study of these systems has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental research in recent years .",
    "it is by now well established that one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets with integer spin have a gap in the excitation spectrum , whereas those with half - integer spin have gapless excitations .",
    "the former have a finite correlation length , while for the latter it is infinite with the spin - spin correlation function decaying to zero as a power law . in 2-dimensions ,",
    "the unfrustrated square - lattice heisenberg model has long range nel order in the ground state .",
    "it has gapless goldstone modes as expected . for the 3-dimensional heisenberg model ,",
    "one expects a stronger long - range nel order@xcite in the ground state .    in recent years",
    "much interest has focussed on systems with intermediate dimensionality and on questions of crossovers between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the investigations@xcite showed that the crossover from the single heisenberg chain to the two - dimensional antiferromagnetic square lattice , obtained by assembling chains to form a `` ladder '' of increasing width , is far from smooth .",
    "heisenberg ladders with an even number of legs ( chains ) show a completely different behavior from odd - leg - ladders . while even - leg - ladders have a spin gap and short range correlations , odd - leg - ladders have no gap and power - law correlations .",
    "what happens to the crossover from the two - dimensional antiferromagnetic square lattice to the three - dimensional antiferromagnetic simple cubic lattice , obtained by assembling planes to form a multi - layer system ?",
    "the spin-@xmath3 bilayer heisenberg antiferromagnet has been well studied , and it has a second order transition@xcite separating the nel phase and dimer phase , and this critical points can be remarkably well fitted by the following linear relation : @xmath4~.\\ ] ] the systems with more than two planes have not been studied , as far as we are aware .",
    "as in the case with even and odd numbers of coupled chains , we may expect the heisenberg antiferromagnet on an odd number of coupled planes to show a fundamentally different behavior from that for an even number of coupled planes .",
    "the multilayer heisenberg antiferromagnet has recently attracted attention also due to its relevance to the understanding of the magnetic properties of cuprate superconductors ( such as yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 ) containing two or more weakly coupled cuo@xmath5 layers@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the zero temperature properties of the @xmath8-layer , @xmath0 , square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet , where each layer is composed of a nearest - neighbor heisenberg model on a square lattice , and there is a further antiferromagnetic coupling between corresponding sites of each layer .",
    "the system can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 is a s=1/2 spin operator at site @xmath12 of the @xmath13th layer , and @xmath14 denotes a pair of nearest neighbor sites on a square lattice . here",
    "@xmath15 is the interaction between nearest neighbor spins in one plane , and @xmath16 is the interaction between adjacent spins from different layers .",
    "we denote the ratio of couplings as @xmath17 , that is , @xmath18 . in the present paper ,",
    "we study only the case of antiferromagnetic coupling , that is , both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are positive . in the small @xmath19 limit",
    ", the model describes @xmath8 weakly interacting 2d heisenberg antiferromagnets , where each of them is nel ordered and possesses gapless goldstone excitations . while in the large @xmath19 limit , the system reduces to weakly coupled rungs , and each rung is described by the hamiltonian @xmath20 the ground state of @xmath21 is an @xmath22 singlet for even @xmath8 , or an @xmath23 doublet for odd @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that there are some fundamental differences between even and odd numbers of coupled planes . for an odd number of layers , the system can be mapped to the well - known single layer heisenberg antiferromagnet at the large @xmath16 limit , and so the system should have nel order for all ratios of interlayer to intralayer couplings . for an even number of layers , on the other hand , the system has a definite gap at the large @xmath16 limit , so we expect",
    "there is a transition separating the gapless nel phase and gapped quantum disordered spin liquid phase at a certain critical ratio of @xmath19 , and this transition should lie in the universality class of the classical @xmath24 heisenberg model , as for the bilayer system@xcite .    to confirm the above arguments",
    ", we study these systems with up to 6 layers via various series expansions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we develop two different ising expansions for the 3 and 5-layer systems . the first one is the usual naive ising expansion where we take the @xmath25-component of the hamiltonian as the unperturbed hamiltonian , and the rest of it as the perturbation . in the second ising expansion ,",
    "we choose the eigenstates of @xmath21 , which has an @xmath23 doublet as the ground state , as the basis states . at the large @xmath16 limit",
    ", @xmath26 can be mapped to the well known spin-@xmath27 single layer heisenberg antiferromagnet described by an effective hamiltonian @xmath28 , so we can take @xmath29 and the @xmath25-component of @xmath28 as the unperturbed hamiltonian , and the rest as the perturbation .",
    "the first ising expansion works best in the small @xmath19 region , while the second one works best in the large @xmath19 region .",
    "series are calculated for the ground - state energy , staggered magnetization , and triplet excitation spectra .",
    "extrapolating these series to the isotropic limit , we find the system has long range nel order and gapless excitation for all ratios of interlayer to intralayer couplings , as for the square lattice . in section iii , the 4 and 6-layer systems are studied by means of expansion in the interlayer coupling @xmath16 , and the transition points are located .",
    "the last section is devoted to a summary .",
    "for @xmath30 , the eigenstates for @xmath21 consist of    \\1 ) one @xmath31 doublet with energy @xmath32 and eigenstates @xmath33 where the arrows represent , from left to right , the @xmath25-components of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , and the eigen states are denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the total spin , the @xmath25-component of the total spin , and its corresponding eigenvalue , respectively .",
    "this is the ground state of @xmath21 .",
    "\\2 ) another @xmath31 doublet with energy @xmath40 and eigenstates @xmath41    \\3 ) one @xmath42 quartet with energy @xmath43 and eigenstates @xmath44    so in the limit of @xmath45 , the ground state of the whole system is the direct product of the ground states of each rung , which are degenerate with @xmath0 and @xmath46 , and so it is @xmath47-fold degenerate ( @xmath48 is no . of sites ) .",
    "a finite value of @xmath15 lifts this degeneracy ( to 2 ) . in this @xmath47-dimensional subspace",
    ", one can define an effective hamiltonian @xmath28 which includes all interactions @xmath26 . to first order in @xmath49",
    "we obtain@xcite @xmath50 with effective coupling @xmath51 note that @xmath52 for heisenberg ladder systems has been computed by n. hatano and y. nishiyama@xcite , and their results can also be applied to the multi - plane heisenberg antiferromagnet discussed here .",
    "therefore the ground state energy per site to first order in @xmath49 will be @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the ground state energy per site for the square lattice@xcite .    to find out the staggered magnetization at large @xmath16 limit , one needs to look at the results of the operator @xmath55 on the states @xmath56 and @xmath57 : @xmath58 if we only keep the states which are the ground states of @xmath21 , and compare the above relations with that for the single layer square lattice , we can get the staggered magnetization at the large @xmath16 limit as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the staggered magnetization for the single layer square lattice.@xcite    for other odd @xmath8 values , the ground states of @xmath21 are also two spin-@xmath27 doublet states . in table",
    "i , we listed the ground state energy @xmath61 of @xmath21 , the effective coupling @xmath52 and the staggered magnetization @xmath62 at the large @xmath16 limit for @xmath63 , and these are also shown in figure 1 , where we can see that as @xmath8 increases , @xmath64 is generally close to unity but increases monotonically , while @xmath65 decreases about as @xmath66 . at the limit of @xmath67",
    ", we expect that @xmath64 approaches a constant@xcite , while @xmath65 decreases to zero .    since at both large and small @xmath17 limits ,",
    "the system can be reduced to a single plane heisenberg antiferromagnet , we expect that unlike the bilayer heisenberg antiferromagnets , there is no transition at any value of @xmath17 .    to study the properties of these systems , we develop following two different ising expansions .",
    "the first one is the usual naive ising expansion where we take the @xmath25-component of the hamiltonian as the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath68 , and the rest of it as the perturbation @xmath69 : we write the hamiltonian for the heisenberg - ising model as : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 on the two sublattices .",
    "the last term in both @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a local staggered field term , which can be included to improve convergence .",
    "the limits @xmath73 and @xmath74 correspond to the ising model and the isotropic heisenberg model respectively . the operator @xmath68 is taken as the unperturbed hamiltonian , with the unperturbed ground state being the usual nel state . the operator @xmath69 is treated as a perturbation .",
    "it flips a pair of spins on neighbouring sites .",
    "the linked - cluster expansion method has been previously reviewed in several articles@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the ising series have been calculated for the ground state energy per site @xmath75 , the staggered magnetization @xmath62 , and the lowest lying triplet excitation spectrum @xmath76 for several ratios of couplings and ( simultaneously ) for several values of @xmath77 up to order @xmath78 for @xmath30 or order @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "the triplet excitation spectrum is computed for @xmath30 only .",
    "the resulting series for @xmath75 and @xmath62 for @xmath81 are listed in tables ii , and the other series are available on request .",
    "there are three bands of the spin - wave dispersion for 3-layer systems . in the ising limit ,",
    "2 bands have initial excitations located in the side planes , and the third band has it in the middle plane .",
    "from the series one can see that all three bands have the following symmetry : @xmath82    since at the large @xmath16 limit the system can be mapped to the well known spin-@xmath27 single layer heisenberg antiferromagnet with effective hamiltonian @xmath28 defined in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) , we can develop , in the basis of the eigenstates of @xmath21 , another ising expansion , the so called `` modified ising expansion '' , where we take @xmath29 and the @xmath25-component of @xmath28 as the unperturbed hamiltonian , and the rest as the perturbation .",
    "that is , we write the hamiltonian for the heisenberg - ising model as : @xmath83 where @xmath84 @xmath85 is @xmath25-component of the total spin for @xmath12th rung , and again the last term in both @xmath86 and @xmath87 is a local staggered field term , which can be included to improve convergence .",
    "the limits @xmath73 and @xmath74 correspond to the ising model and the isotropic heisenberg model respectively . the operator @xmath86 is taken as the unperturbed hamiltonian , with the unperturbed ground state being the usual nel state . the operator @xmath87 is treated as a perturbation .",
    "the detailed eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath21 and also the matrix elements @xmath87 under the eigenstates of @xmath21 for both @xmath30 and @xmath80 are available from the author .    here",
    "the ising series have been calculated for the ground state energy per site @xmath75 , and the staggered magnetization @xmath62 for several ratios of couplings and ( simultaneously ) for several values of @xmath77 up to order @xmath88 for @xmath30 or order @xmath89 for @xmath80 .",
    "the resulting series for @xmath75 and @xmath62 for @xmath90 are listed in tables ii , and the other series are available on request .",
    "having obtained the series for the above two ising expansions we try to extrapolate the series to the isotropic point ( @xmath74 ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we first transform the series to a new variable @xmath91 to remove the singularity at @xmath74 predicted by the spin - wave theory .",
    "this was first proposed by huse@xcite and was also used in our earlier work on the square lattice case@xcite .",
    "we then use both integrated first - order inhomogeneous differential approximants@xcite and naive pad approximants to extrapolate the series to the isotropic point @xmath92 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the results for the ground state energy per site @xmath75 , and the staggered magnetization @xmath62 are shown in figs . 2 - 3 .",
    "the results for @xmath93 presented in the figures are taken from our earlier work on the single - layer square lattice@xcite , while the results for @xmath45 are taken from the mapping of the system on to the single layer system .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour , eq .",
    "( [ e0j2 ] ) , of the ground state energy is also shown in fig .",
    "2 as dotted line , and they match on to those ising expansions very well .",
    "the results from two ising expansion also match each other very well in certain regions of coupling .",
    "we note that @xmath62 first increases for small @xmath19 , passes through a maximum at about @xmath94 , and then decreases for larger values of @xmath19 .",
    "the reason that in the case of small @xmath19 , the interlayer coupling enhances the antiferromagnetic long - range order is that the system acquires a weak three dimensionality and quantum fluctuations are suppressed .",
    "the spin - wave theory for the bilayer heisenberg antiferromagnet predicts that @xmath62 should be proportional to @xmath95 in the small @xmath19 region , we can expect this will happen for any multi - layer system , and so in figs .",
    "2 - 3 we show @xmath96 and @xmath62 as a function of @xmath97 $ ] to exhibit this behaviour . from fig .",
    "3 , we can see that in the small @xmath19 region , the 5-layer system has slightly stronger nel order than the 3-layer system , while in the large @xmath19 region , the 3-layer system has stronger nel order .    figs .",
    "4 - 6 show the three bands of triplet excitation spectra of the 3-layer system obtained from the naive ising expansion . from these graphs",
    ", we can see that all of the dispersion relations have a minimum located at @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 by symmetry ) , where two of these three bands have a definite gap as long as @xmath100 , while the third ( the outer symmetry band ) is consistent with a gapless spectrum for all values of @xmath16 .",
    "for even @xmath8 , the ground state of @xmath21 is a @xmath22 singlet .",
    "for example , the eigenstates of @xmath21 for @xmath101 consist of    \\1 ) one @xmath102 singlet with energy @xmath103 and eigenstate @xmath104 where @xmath105 this is the ground state of @xmath29 .",
    "\\2 ) one @xmath106 triplet with energy @xmath107 and eigenstates @xmath108 where @xmath109    \\3 ) another @xmath106 triplet with energy @xmath110 and eigenstates : @xmath111    \\4 ) another @xmath102 singlet with energy @xmath112 and eigenstate @xmath113    \\5 ) another @xmath106 triplet with energy @xmath114 and eigenstates : @xmath115",
    "\\6 ) one @xmath116 quintuplet with energy @xmath117 and eigenstates @xmath118    so at the limit of @xmath45 , the ground state of the whole system is the direct product of the ground state of each rung .",
    "unlike the case for odd value of @xmath8 , there is not degeneracy in this ground state , and the system has a definite excitation gap .",
    "the operator @xmath119 on the ground state @xmath120 gives @xmath121 again unlike the case for odd @xmath8 , the right hand side of the above equation does not contain the ground state @xmath120 , so in the large @xmath16 limit , the staggered magnetization @xmath62 is zero , that is , the system is in a quantum disordered spin liquid state .",
    "so we expect there is a transition separating the gapless nel phase and gapped quantum disordered spin liquid phase at a certain critical ratio of @xmath19 , and we expect that this is true for any even number of layers .    to locate the transition point",
    ", we can develop the expansions around the large interlayer coupling limit , that is , we can construct an expansion in @xmath122 by treating the operator @xmath123 as the unperturbed hamiltonian and operator @xmath26 as a perturbation .",
    "we have developed the expansion for the @xmath124 ground state energy per site @xmath75 , the antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath125 , and the lowest lying triplet excitation spectrum @xmath76 up to a certain order ( see table iii ) for @xmath101 and 6 .",
    "the resulting power series in @xmath122 for @xmath75 and @xmath125 are presented in table iii .",
    "the series for the minimum energy gap @xmath126 is also listed in table iii .",
    "the series for the excitations spectra @xmath76 are available on request .    to determine the critical point",
    ", we construct dlog pad approximants@xcite to the @xmath125 and @xmath127 series .",
    "since the transition should lie in the universality class of the classical @xmath24 heisenberg model ( our analysis also supports this ) , we expect that the critical index for @xmath125 and @xmath127 should be approximately 1.40 and 0.71 , respectively .",
    "the exponent - biased dlog pad approximants give the critical point @xmath128 for @xmath101 , and @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "the critical points @xmath131 as function of @xmath132 are shown in fig . 7",
    "( the results for @xmath133 are taken from a previous calculation@xcite ) , where we can see they can be well fitted by @xmath134 .",
    "so @xmath131 should be proportional to @xmath132 at the large @xmath8 limit .",
    "the triplet excitation spectra @xmath135 at the critical point for @xmath136 are illustrated in fig .",
    "8(a ) : the results for @xmath133 are also displayed here for ease of comparison .",
    "we can see , as in the case of the bilayer heisenberg antiferromagnet@xcite , the direct sum to the series is indeed consistent with the pad approximants that one can construct .",
    "the spectra have their maximum value @xmath137 at @xmath98 . in fig .",
    "8(b ) , we plot the function for @xmath138 along high - symmetry cuts through the brillouin zone , and we can see this function appears to be an universal function , independent of the number of layers @xmath8 . we have no independent theory to explain it at present , but argue this may be due to the fact they belong to the same universality class .",
    "we have presented and analyzed various perturbation series expansions for multi - layer , @xmath0 , square lattice heisenberg model with up to 6 coupled planes . like heisenberg ladder system ,",
    "the heisenberg antiferromagnet on an odd number of coupled planes shows a fundamentally different behavior from that for an even number of coupled planes .    for an odd number of layers , the system can be mapped to the well - known single layer heisenberg antiferromagnet at the large @xmath16 limit , and so the system should have nel order for all ratios of interlayer to intralayer couplings : that is , it is similar to the case of the square lattice .",
    "the staggered magnetization @xmath62 at the large @xmath19 limit is computed up to 11-layers , and we found @xmath62 should decrease to zero as @xmath66 in the large @xmath8 limit . for the systems with 3 and 5-layers , two ising expansions have been developed , and series are calculated for the ground - state energy , the staggered magnetization , and the triplet excitation spectra . extrapolating these series to the isotropic limit , we find the system has long range nel order and gapless excitations for all ratios of interlayer to intralayer couplings . for an even numbers of layers , expansions in the interlayer coupling have been developed for both 4 and 6 layers .",
    "the systems turn out to have a second order transition separating a gapless nel phase and a gapped quantum disordered spin liquid phase , where the critical point is determined to be @xmath128 for @xmath101 , and @xmath129 for @xmath130 , and this critical point should be proportional to @xmath132 it the large @xmath8 limit .",
    "the triplet excitation spectra are also computed , and at the critical point , it turns out that the excitation spectrum , after normalization by its maximum value , appears to be an universal function , independent of the number of layers . this may be due to the fact that they belong to the same universality class .",
