    "the very precise constraints that have been placed recently on the cosmological world model by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and high - redshift supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) require that most of the matter in the universe is non - baryonic `` dark matter '' and that the largest contributor to the energy density of the universe is the `` dark energy '' .",
    "but these two mysterious quantities that dominate the energy density of the universe still could be merely fitting parameters ",
    "akin to ptolemaic epicycles  that are not physical quantities .",
    "there is , therefore , great urgency to discover the nature of the dark matter and dark energy which are the foundations of the new cosmological paradigm .",
    "the structure of dark matter ( dm ) halos is a sensitive probe of the properties of the dm . in the standard @xmath7cdm paradigm ,",
    "n - body simulations show that the radial density profiles of dm halos are fairly uniform , approximately parameterized by the nfw profile , @xmath8 @xcite . at small radii ( @xmath9 the density profiles follow a power law , although the precise value of the power - law exponent remains controversial ; i.e. , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 according to nfw and @xmath12 according to the simulations of @xcite .",
    "observations of the rotation curves of low - surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest a profile for the dm that is substantially flatter @xmath13 ) than @xmath7cdm in the central regions .",
    "these observations inspired @xcite to propose the existence of `` self - interacting '' dm ( sidm ) . in the sidm model the dm particles are assumed to possess some cross section for elastic collisions with each other .",
    "detailed cdm simulations incorporating the sidm idea have confirmed that the dm profiles of lsb galaxies can be flattened as observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    like lsb galaxies ,",
    "galaxy clusters provide excellent venues to study dm because they are dm - dominated from deep down into their cores ( @xmath14 ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) out to their virial radii ( 1 )",
    ". moreover , several powerful techniques are available for probing the cluster matter distributions : optical studies of galaxy dynamics and gravitational lensing , and x - ray observations of the hot gas .",
    "each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages .",
    "for example , some advantages of using x - ray observations are that the hot gas in clusters traces the three - dimensional gravitational potential with an isotropic pressure tensor .",
    "the quality of data for the hot gas is limited only by the sensitivity and resolution of the x - ray detectors and not by the finite number of galaxies .",
    "the most important limitation associated with x - ray observations of cluster mass distributions is the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "a large fraction of nearby clusters ( @xmath15 ) do have regular image morphologies and appear to be relaxed on 0.5 - 1 mpc scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for such clusters with regular morphologies ( i.e. , not currently experiencing a major merger ) cosmological n - body simulations",
    "have determined that masses calculated by assuming perfect hydrostatic equilibrium are generally quite accurate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but clusters that are observed to be relaxed on 0.5 - 1 mpc scales are typically associated with cooling flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observations have demonstrated that the inner cores of cooling flows are highly disturbed exhibiting holes and filamentary structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which certainly raise serious questions about the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "hence , for studies of dm it is imperative to find clusters that are relaxed ( i.e. , have smooth , regular x - ray images ) from deep within their cores out to @xmath16  mpc scales .",
    "our recent analysis of the  acis - s data of one such cluster ( a2029 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has provided the strongest constraint on the core dm profile for a galaxy cluster to date ; i.e. , @xmath17 , constrained down to @xmath14 .",
    "the core dm density profile of a2029 is consistent with the nfw profile and rules out an important contribution from sidm in this cluster . since the dm properties of a2029 may not be typical , and the expected cosmological scatter @xcite needs to be addressed , more x - ray observations of clusters with undisturbed cores are very much needed .    in our present study",
    "we analyze of the core dm profile of the galaxy cluster a2589 using a new  acis - s observation .",
    "we selected a2589 as the brightest , nearby ( @xmath18 ) cluster with a smooth x - ray morphology ( according to  images , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and without a known central radio source @xcite .",
    "the latter criterion greatly increases the likelihood that the x - ray image of the core is undisturbed .",
    "( the redshift of a2589 corresponds to an angular diameter distance of 171  mpc and @xmath19  kpc assuming @xmath20  , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . )",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ obs ]",
    "we present the observation and discuss the data reduction .",
    "the spectral analysis of the acis - s data is discussed in  [ spec ] .",
    "we calculate the gravitating matter distribution in  [ grav ] , the gas mass and gas fraction in  [ gas ] , and estimate the stellar mass in  [ stars ] .",
    "the dm profile and the systematic error budget are discussed in  [ dm ] and  [ sys ] respectively . finally , in  [ conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "a2589 was observed with the acis - s ccd camera for approximately 15  ks during ao-3 as part of the  guest observer program .",
    "the events list was corrected for charge - transfer inefficiency according to @xcite , and only events characterized by the standard  grades were used .",
    "the exposure time after applying these procedures is 13.7  ks .",
    "the standard software ( version 2.3 ) was used for most of the subsequent data preparation .",
    "since the diffuse x - ray emission of a2589 fills the entire s3 chip , we attempted to use the standard background templates to model the background .",
    "although there were no strong flares ( i.e. , `` strong '' being defined as count rates @xmath23 times nominal ) , there was mild flaring activity during most of the observation .",
    "consequently , after running the standard lc_clean script to clean the source events list of flares with the same screening criteria as the background templates , only 3  ks remain .    to salvage a large portion of the observation ( 8.7  ks ) while obtaining a more accurate estimate for the background than given by the standard templates alone , we followed the procedure discussed in @xcite .",
    "that is , we first extracted the source spectrum from regions near the edge of the s3 chip and subtracted from it the spectrum of the corresponding regions of the background template .",
    "( following @xcite we renormalized the background template by comparing the acis - s1 data of the source and background observations for energies above 10  kev .",
    "this resulted in a normalization 8% above nominal . )",
    "we fitted the resultant spectrum with a two - component model consisting of a thermal component , represented by an  thermal plasma , and a broken power - law ( bpl ) model , representing the residual flaring background which is most pronounced at high energies . for the bpl model",
    "we obtain a break energy of 5  kev with power - law indices of 0 below the break and 1.9 above the break .",
    "we scale this model to the area of the annular regions of interest ( see below ) and generate a pha correction file for use in ; i.e. , for each region analyzed below we subtract background contributions from the standard templates and a correction pha file accounting for the excess flaring .",

    "we restricted the spectral fitting between 0.5 - 5  kev to avoid calibration uncertainties at lower energies and systematic errors associated with the background subtraction at high energies . to estimate the statistical errors on the fitted parameters we simulated spectra for each annulus using the best - fitting models and fit the simulated spectra in exactly the same manner as done for the actual data . from 100 monte carlo simulations",

    "typically , both abundances fitted to low values ( i.e. , sub - solar ratios with respect to iron ) but are consistent with the iron abundance within the estimated @xmath57 errors . since it was also found that when allowing silicon and oxygen to be free the fitted temperatures and normalizations did not vary appreciably within their @xmath57 errors , we decided to keep silicon and oxygen tied to iron in the fits as done for the other elements .    we also found that adding another temperature component did not improve the fits much .",
    "for example , in the central annulus adding another temperature component improved @xmath56 by 3 but with the addition of two free parameters ( one for temperature and one for normalization  abundances are tied to the first temperature component ) . the second temperature component ( @xmath64  kev )",
