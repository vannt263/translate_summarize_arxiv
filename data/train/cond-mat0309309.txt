    "in recent years a large amount of experimental results has pointed out that the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction plays a significant role in determining the electronic and magnetic properties of new materials as the high @xmath0 superconductors and the colossal magneto - resistance manganites.@xcite the experimental data have given rise to a renewed interest in models of the e - ph coupled system .",
    "in this paper we investigate the polaronic features of the frhlich model within a variational approach.@xcite here the picture is the following . when an electron in the conduction band of a polar crystal moves through the crystal , its coulomb field produces in its neighborhood an ionic polarization that will influence the electron motion",
    ". then the particle must carry this polarization with it during its motion through the crystal .",
    "the quasi - particle formed by the electron and the induced polarization charge is called polaron . within the frhlich model : 1 ) the optical modes have the same frequency ; 2 )",
    "the dielectric is treated as a continuum medium ; 3 ) in the undistorted lattice the electron moves as a free particle with a quadratic dispersion relation ( effective band mass approximation ) .    the problem of finding the ground state energy of the frhlich hamiltonian attracted the interest of a lot of researchers mainly in the period 1950 - 1955 .",
    "numerous mathematical techniques have been used to solve this problem : from the perturbation theory in the weak coupling regime@xcite to the strong coupling theory,@xcite from the linked cluster theory@xcite to variational@xcite and monte carlo approaches.@xcite the weak coupling regime is well described within the lee , low and pines ( llp ) approach.@xcite here , after the dependence of the hamiltonian on the electron coordinates has been eliminated , an upper bound for the polaron ground state energy is obtained by using a variational wave function which is based on the physical assumption that successive virtual phonons are emitted independently . in the opposite regime ,",
    "when the e - ph interaction is very strong , a good description of the polaron features has been obtained by landau and pekar.@xcite their theory , based on a variational calculation , stems from the idea that , for very large values of the e - ph coupling constant , the electron can follow adiabatically the quantum zero - point fluctuations of the polarization field . in their first papers",
    "the electron is localized with a gaussian wave function .",
    "next , the method has been improved by hohler@xcite by constructing an eigenstate of the total wave number by superposing landau - pekar states localized at different points of the lattice . in any case",
    "the validity of llp and hohler approaches is restricted , respectively , to weak and strong e - ph coupling regimes .",
    "an excellent approximation , that is accurate at all couplings , has been introduced by feynman.@xcite his approach provides a variational estimate of the electron self - energy based on the path integrals and the feynman - jensen inequality .",
    "after the phonon variables have been eliminated exactly , feynman introduces a model hamiltonian which describes approximatively the interaction of the electron with the lattice .",
    "this hamiltonian is that of an electron coupled to another particle with a harmonic oscillator coupling .",
    "the trial action for the system is obtained by eliminating the coordinates of the fictitious particle simulating the phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "the mass @xmath1 of the fictitious particle and the spring constant are the two variational parameters within the feynman approach .",
    "the monte carlo study@xcite of the frhlich model has demonstrated the remarkable accuracy of the feynman method to the electron self - energy .    in this paper",
    "we use a variational technique , within an hamiltonian approach , to investigate the polaronic features of the frhlich model .",
    "it is based on linear superposition of two translationally invariant wave functions that provide a very good description of the weak and strong e - ph coupling regimes .",
    "these wave functions are built assuming as starting points the llp@xcite and hohler@xcite variational approaches .",
    "first , we improve these methods obtaining a better upper bound for the polaron ground state energy in the two asymptotic regimes of weak and strong e - ph interaction .",
    "then , we use a linear superposition of these two wave functions .",
    "the comparison of our results with the feynman@xcite and monte carlo data@xcite shows that the proposed method provides an excellent description of the polaron ground state energy for any value of the e - ph coupling . within our variational approach ,",
    "the estimate of the electron self - energy turns out systematically lower than one of the feynman method .",
    "in particular , unlike the feynman approach , the ground state energy shows the exact dependence on the e - ph coupling constant in the strong coupling regime .",
    "next , we calculate the mean number of phonons present in the virtual phonon cloud surrounding the electron , the average electronic kinetic and interaction energies , the ground state spectral weight and the induced ionic polarization charge density .",
    "these quantities are successfully compared with monte carlo@xcite and feynman results.@xcite    the proposed method has the advantage to exhibit , first to the author s knowledge , a wave function that gives the correct behavior in both weak and strong coupling limits and provides an interpolation between them with results at least accurate as those of the feynman approach .",
    "the frhlich model@xcite is described by the hamiltonian :    @xmath2    in eq.([1r ] ) @xmath3 is the band mass of the electron , @xmath4 is the longitudinal optical phonon energy , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the position and momentum operators of the electron , @xmath7 represents the creation operator for phonons with wave number @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicates the e - ph matrix element . in the frhlich model,@xcite @xmath9 assumes the form : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , dimensionless quantity , is the e - ph coupling constant , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the volume of the system .",

    "the best value for @xmath24 turns out : @xmath26    an excellent approximation for the true energy ( [ 17r ] ) is obtained by using a trial wave function similar to that one introduced by pekar:@xcite @xmath27   \\label{21r}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 normalization constant and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 variational parameters .",
    "the minimization of @xmath32 leads to : @xmath33 this upper bound for the energy differs from the exact value less than @xmath34 .",
    "it is given by the sum of two terms .",
    "the first one corresponds to use a gaussian wave function in the landau and pekar s method ( eq.([18r ] ) ) .",
    "the last one does not depend on the e - ph coupling constant @xmath11 .",
    "the origin of this contribution in feynman s expansion of the polaron energy has been discussed by allcock@xcite by using the perturbation theory in the strong coupling limit .",
    "our first aim is to put this result on variational basis .",
    "this will allow us to characterize the terms that one has to introduce in the trial wave function to improve the landau and pekar s ansatz .",

    "the minimization of @xmath57 with respect to the variational parameter @xmath24 and the asymptotic expansion for @xmath58 restore the eq.([23r ] ) .",
    "then , the order beyond the landau and pekar s theory is due to the lattice fluctuations and to the consequent change in the electron wave function .",

    "this allows to obtain , for @xmath74 , an upper bound for the polaron ground state energy better than the feynman approach when the approximating action is represented by a fixed harmonic binding potential ( eq.([35r ] ) ) . on the other hand , both these methods give the same result for @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "however , both the methods show a discontinuity in the transition from the weak to strong coupling regime .    to overcome this difficulty one has to take into account the translational invariance .",
    "we construct an eigenstate of the total wave number by taking a superposition of the localized states ( [ 39r ] ) centered on any point of the lattice in the same manner in which one constructs a bloch wave function from a linear combination of atomic orbitals : @xmath77 the minimization , with respect to the variational parameters , of the expectation value of the frhlich hamiltonian on this state , that accounts for the translationally symmetry , and the asymptotic expansion for @xmath58 provide : @xmath78\\hbar\\omega_0 .",

    "when the value of @xmath11 is very small the lattice follows adiabatically the electron .",
    "a good physical description of the polaron features in this regime is provided by the llp approach.@xcite the starting point is the observation that the total momentum operator : @xmath80 is a motion constant , i.e. it commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "the conservation law of the total momentum is taken into account through the unitary transformation : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the eigenvalue of @xmath83 . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the ground state properties of the e - ph coupled system , so that we will restrict ourselves to the case @xmath84 .",

    "@xmath89 is the lowest energy state of the first two terms of the transformed hamiltonian @xmath41 .",
    "the use of this wave function is based on the physical assumption that , when the e - ph interaction is weak , there is not correlation among the emission of successive virtual phonons by the electron .",
    "this assumption restricts the validity of this approach to the regime characterized by small values of @xmath11 .",
    "the ground state energy turns out @xmath90 . in other words",
    ", this method puts the results of the perturbation theory on variational basis .    to improve the llp approximation,@xcite one has to introduce in the trial wave function a better description of the recoil effect of the electron , effect present only on average in llp approach",
    "this can be done using the following ansatz : @xmath91 , \\label{7r}\\ ] ] that takes into account the correlation between the virtual emission of pairs of phonons.@xcite in this paper we will choose : @xmath92 and @xmath93 here @xmath31 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are three variational parameters that have to be determined by minimizing the expectation value of the hamiltonian ( [ 1r ] ) on the state ( [ 7r ] ) .",

    "is provided by the wave function ( [ 7r ] ) . moreover , in the weak and intermediate e - ph coupling , @xmath98 , these two solutions are not orthogonal and have non zero off diagonal matrix elements .",
    "this suggests that the lowest state of the system is made of a mixture of the two wave functions that give an accurate description of weak and strong e - ph coupling regimes .",

    "we perform the minimization procedure in two steps .",
    "first , the expectation values of the frhlich hamiltonian on the two trial wave functions in eq.([7r ] ) and eq.([43r ] ) are minimized and the variational parameters are determined . then , the minimization procedure discussed in the present section is carried out . this way to proceed simplifies significantly the computational effort and makes",
    "all described calculations accessible on a personal computer .",
    "an approach , similar to that one described in this section , has been successfully used for the holstein model.@xcite    the procedure of minimization of the quantity @xmath71 with respect to @xmath103 and @xmath104 gives for the polaron ground state energy @xmath105 and for the ratio of the two parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xmath106 here @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",

    "these quantities are reported , respectively , in fig.2 , fig.3 and fig.4 where are compared with the same properties obtained in the feynman s variational treatment based on path integrals . @xcite as for the ground state energy , our variational ansatz is able to recover all the expected behaviors . for small values of @xmath11 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116",
    "as predicted by the llp approach@xcite and the weak coupling perturbation theory.@xcite in the opposite regime the electron follows adiabatically the lattice polarization changes .",
    "the values @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 obtained within the landau and pekar s variational treatment ( see eq.([18r ] ) ) , based on the electron self - trapping with a gaussian wave function , represent very accurate estimates of these quantities when they are calculated within the feynman s approach .",
    "on the other hand , the values @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 obtained within the pekar s variational treatment ( see eq.([21r ] ) ) represent very good approximations for the same quantities calculated within our approach .",
    "then the variational feynman s and our methods differ mainly in the strong coupling regime as it turns out from the plots in fig.1 , fig.2 , fig.3 and fig.4 .",
    "we stress that , in this range of values of @xmath11 , our approach provides a better estimate of the polaron ground state energy than the feynman s",
    "method.@xcite    another physical quantity of interest is @xmath123 , i.e. the average ionic polarization charge density induced at a distance @xmath124 by the electron .",
    "this quantity is related to the static correlation function between the electron position @xmath125 and the oscillator displacement at @xmath5 : @xmath126 it easy to show , analytically , that the exact sum rule for the total induced charge:@xcite @xmath127 is satisfied within our variational approach .",
    "figure 5 shows @xmath128 as a function of @xmath124 for different values of the e - ph matrix element @xmath11 corresponding to weak , intermediate and strong coupling regimes .",

    "@xcite if the e - ph coupling is weak , the lattice deformation is not able to trap the charge carrier .",
    "the extension of the polaron is large compared with the characteristic length @xmath129 .",
    "the situation is different in the opposite regime where the lattice deformation is localized around the electron . in any case also this correlation function , evaluated within our approach , is in agreement with the best data available in literature .",
    "finally figure 6 shows the ground state spectral weight : @xmath130 where @xmath87 is the electronic vacuum state containing no phonons and @xmath131 is the electron creator operator in the momentum space .",
    "@xmath132 represents the renormalization coefficient of the one - electron green s function and gives the fraction of the bare electron state in the polaron trial wave function .",
    "this quantity is compared with that one obtained in the diagrammatic quantum monte carlo method.@xcite the result of the weak coupling perturbation theory is also indicated : @xmath133 . for small values of @xmath11 the main part of the spectral weight is located at energies that correspond approximatively to the bare electronic levels . increasing the e - ph interaction , the spectral weight decreases very fast and becomes practically zero in the strong coupling regime . here",
    "the most part of the spectral weight is located at excited states .",
    "the diagrammatic quantum monte carlo study@xcite of the frhlich polaron has pointed out that there is no stable excited states in the energy gap between the ground state energy and the continuum .",
    "there are , instead , several many phonon unstable states at fixed energies : @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "these results seem to be contrary to the data about the optical absorption of large polarons,@xcite which show , for large values of @xmath11 , the presence of a very narrow peak corresponding to the electronic transitions from the ground state to the first relaxed excited state ( res ) .",
    "the nature of the excited states and the optical absorption of polarons in the frhlich model require further study which is beyond the scope of this paper .    in conclusion , in this paper , a variational approach has been developed to investigate the features of the frhlich model .",
    "it has been shown that a linear superposition of two wave functions , that describe the two asymptotic regimes of weak and strong e - ph coupling , provides an estimate of the polaron ground state energy which is in very good agreement with the best available results for any value of the e - ph matrix element .",
    "all the evaluated ground state properties show that the crossover between the two asymptotic regimes is very smooth . on the other hand",
    "the transfer of spectral weight from the polaron ground state to the higher energy bands turns out very fast .",
    "we stress that , to the best of our knowledge , it is the first time that a variational wave function , able to interpolate between the weak and strong e - ph coupling regimes , at least carefully as the feynman method,@xcite is exhibited for the frhlich model .",
