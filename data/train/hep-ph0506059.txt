    "the analysis of the role of strangeness in nuclear structure in the aspect of multi - strange system is of great importance for relativistic heavy - ion collisions and for astrophysics for the description of hyperon star matter . at the core of a neutron star the matter density ranges from a few times the density of normal nuclear matter to about an order of a magnitude higher .",
    "thus exotic forms of matter such as hyperons are expected to emerge in the interior of a neutron star .",
    "the appearance of these additional degrees of freedom and their impact on a neutron star structure have been the subject of extensive studies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "properties of matter at such extreme densities are of particular importance in determining forms of equations of state relevant to neutron stars and successively in examining their global parameters .",
    "+ the existence of bound strange hadronic matter which in addition to nucleons contains also hyperons has profound consequences for astrophysics .",
    "the starting point in studying the role of strangeness in nuclear structure is the knowledge of the properties of a single hypernucleus .",
    "quantum chromodynamics should be applied to the theoretical description of hadronic systems owing to the fact that it constitutes the fundamental theory of strong interactions . however , at the hadronic energy scale where the experimentally observed degrees of freedom are not quarks but hadrons the direct description of nuclei in terms of qcd become inadequate and thus alternative approaches had to be formulated .",
    "one of them is quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite , @xcite which gives quantitative description of the nuclear many body problem .",
    "qhd is a relativistic quantum field theory in which nuclear matter description in terms of baryons and mesons is provided . the original model ( qhd - i ) contains nucleons interacting through the exchange of simulating medium range attraction @xmath0 meson and @xmath1 meson responsible for short range repulsion .",
    "extension ( qhd - ii ) of this theory @xcite,@xcite includes also the isovector meson @xmath2 .",
    "theoretical description of strange hadronic matter , which satisfactorily reproduces nucleon - nucleon and hyperon - nucleon data , has been given within the non - relativistic and relativistic mean field models .",
    "this approach is based on the notion of the meson - exchange model in which baryons interact through the exchange of mesons .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons these models contain @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons , introduced in order to reproduce the strong attractive hyperon - hyperon interactions @xcite .",

    "this paper examines the implications of the strength of hyperon - hyperon coupling constants on the @xmath15-equilibrated hyperon star matter , hence doing all calculations within the framework of relativistic mean field model with two parameterizations , namely the standard tm1 @xcite and tma @xcite .",
    "the results have been obtained for two cases : the weak and strong @xmath16 interactions .",
    "first , the properties of the isospin symmetric strange hadronic matter have been investigated .",
    "the obtained saturation curves resemble those obtained by song et al.@xcite .",
    "the results for the two models ( tm1 and tma ) are very similar .",
    "the extension of the considered model to the @xmath15 equilibrated asymmetric hyperon star model has been done in the subsequent section . as a result of this the composition",
    ", the equation of state and the hyperon star structure for the two parameterizations have been obtained .",
    "information on single hypernuclei can be summarized in the following points :    * @xmath9 hypernuclei : there is a large amount of data on the binding energies @xmath17 of @xmath9 s bound in various single particle orbitals in hypernuclei .",
    "this enables us to study deeply bound states inside the nucleus over an extensive range of mass number .",
    "an analysis of these data with the use of skyrme - hartree - fock @xcite model gives the potential depth of a single @xmath9 in nuclear matter at the value of @xmath18 which corresponds to 1/3 - 1/2 of the nucleon well depth @xmath19 ( in this text all potentials are considered as attractive but the convention of positive sign has been used ) .",
    "* @xmath20 hypernuclei @xcite : the experimental status of @xmath20 nucleus potential still remains controversial .",

    "@xcite indicates that the @xmath20 potential is attractive only at the nuclear surface changing into repulsive one in increasing density .",

    "the main goal of this paper was to study the influence of the strength of hyperon - hyperon interactions on the properties of the hyperon star matter and on a hyperon star structure .",
    "it has been shown that replacing the strong @xmath16 interaction model by the weak one introduces large differences in the composition of a hyperon star matter both in the strange and non - strange sectors .",
    "there is a considerable reduction of @xmath9 hyperon concentration whereas the concentrations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 hyperons are enhanced . in the non - strange sector",
    "the populations of protons and electrons are changed .",
    "the weak model permits larger fractions of protons and electrons .",
    "the presence of hyperons in general leads to the softening of the equation of state . for the employed weak @xmath16 interaction model",
    "there is a density range for which the obtained equation of state is stiffer than the one calculated with the use of the strong model .",
    "this is clearly visible in the case of tm1 parameter set . for higher densities the weak model gives less stiff equation of state .",
    "the behavior of the equation of state is directly connected with the value of the maximum star mass .",
    "equilibrium conditions namely charge neutrality and @xmath15-equilibrium determine the composition of the star . for both parameterizations",
    "the onset points for @xmath41 and @xmath42 hyperons are localized at high densities which are relevant to unstable branches of the mass - radius relations .",
    "thus the obtained stable hyperon star model is composed of neutrons , protons , @xmath9 hyperons and leptons .",
    "the appearance of @xmath41 and @xmath42 hyperons in neutron star interior will be possible in a very special configuration .",
    "a protoneutron star model with very high central density can lead to a hyperon star with @xmath27 and @xmath9 hyperons in its interior .",
    "the possibility of the existence of such protoneutron star model will be the subject of future investigations .",
    "one can compare the obtained results with those presented in the paper by schaffner et al .",
    "@xcite , where the analysis of the existence of the third family of stable compact stars has been performed for highly attractive hyperon - hyperon interaction .",
