    "why red blood cells under normal physiological conditions take the circular biconcave shape ( cbs ) but not the spherical shape aroused the long standing curiosity of human being since its first discovery in the seventieth century . today , physicists ascribe it to the minimization of bending energy of flexible lipid bilayer membrane consisting of amphiphilic molecules . the first successful model revealing the morphology was due to canham@xcite in 1970",
    ". however , his theory suffered from the shortcoming that the membrane was assumed to consist of two identical labile surfaces , and both chemical and physical environments between two sides of the membrane were assumed to be identical too . to overcome the shortcoming , helfrich in 1973 introduced a phenomenological parameter , namely the spontaneous curvature , in describing the more realistic situations : the asymmetry of the two leaflets of the membrane and the chemical or / and physical differences between the interior and exterior membrane@xcite .",
    "as expected , this model gave more abundant shapes than that of canham .",
    "based on the numerical integration technique@xcite , helfrich spontaneous curvature model yielded a catalog of axisymmetric vesicle shapes : the cbs , the prolate and oblate ellipsoid , etc .",
    "more than ten years later , the general equilibrium equation was derived by performing the variation of the helfrich energy functional@xcite .",
    "the first triumph of the equation was the prediction of the existence of clifford torus shape membrane @xcite and its subsequent experimental verification@xcite .",
    "in 1993 , the general equation in axisymmetric case was obtained , and it is a complicated third order nonlinear differential equation @xcite .",
    "an analytic solution capable of representing the cbs@xcite was immediately obtained . in the same year , the first integral of the third order nonlinear differential equation was found ; then the equation reduced to be a second order one involving a constant of integration @xmath0@xcite .",
    "an interesting fact is that the analytical solution requires a nonvanishing value of @xmath0@xcite , whereas only the special case of the second order differential equation with @xmath1 has been well studied by numerical methods@xcite . in 1996 ,",
    "the solution was used to explain the experimentally observed polygonal shape transformation of the cbs@xcite .",
    "studies in this paper will show that this solution actually represents a family of shapes in this solution , but in the family , the cbss have the lower energies and a cbs has the lowest .",
    "for convenience , we will call this solution the cbs solution hereafter .    the existence of the analytical cbs solution in helfrich model proves to be remarkable , because the analytical solutions to a nonlinear theory are rare and precious@xcite . in very special cases of @xmath2 ( cf . following eq.(1 ) ) , the helfrich energy functional reduces to that for constant curvature surfaces and willmore surfaces@xcite , and all known analytical solutions having physical applications in membrane shapes are delaunay surfaces , sphere , torus@xcite , and no more@xcite",
    ". therefore a systematic study of the cbs solution is necessary .",
    "we will find that there are eight types of shapes involved in the solution and the enclosed shapes can be grouped into the prolate or oblate ellipsoid branches .",
    "these two branches are bifurcated from a sphere .    the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , how to obtain the cbs solution from the helfrich model is outlined . in section",
    "iii , all typical shapes contained in the cbs solution are plotted and their parameterizations are presented . in section iv , a systematically analysis of the cbs solution is given . in the shape family",
    ", there is an shape with minimum energy and in section v this shape is found from the the scale invariance of the local curvature energy . in section",
    "vi , a comparison of our results with the previous experimental and theoretical results is given .",
    "in the final section vii , a brief conclusion is given .",
    "equilibrium shapes of phospholipid vesicles are assumed to correspond to the minimum of the elastic energy of the closed bilayer membrane .",
    "the energy functional of helfrich spontaneous curvature model reads as@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the surface area and the volume element for the vesicle , respectively , @xmath6 is an elastic modulus , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the two principal curvatures of the surface , and @xmath9 is the spontaneous curvature to describe the possible asymmetry of the bilayer membrane .",
    "when @xmath9 is zero helfrich model reduces to canham model@xcite . the lagrange multipliers @xmath10 and @xmath11 take account of the constraints of constant volume and area , which can be physically understood as the osmotic pressure between the ambient and the internal environments , and the surface tension , respectively .",
    "the general equilibrium shape equation is@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the laplace - beltrami operator , @xmath14 is the determinant of the metric @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the gaussian curvature and @xmath18 is the mean curvature . assuming that the shape has axisymmetry , the general shape equation eq.(2 ) becomes a third order nonlinear differential equation@xcite @xmath19\\cos\\psi(\\frac{d\\psi}{dr } )   \\nonumber \\\\   & + & [ \\frac{\\delta   p}{k } + \\frac{\\lambda\\sin\\psi}{kr } +   \\frac{c_{o}^{2}\\sin\\psi}{2r } - \\frac{\\sin^{3}\\psi+2\\sin\\psi\\cos^{2}\\psi } { 2r^{3 } } ] ,   \\label{oyhu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the distance from the symmetric @xmath21 axis of rotation",
    ", @xmath22 is the angle made by the surface tangent and the @xmath20 axis as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the positive direction of the angle is that the angle measured clockwise from @xmath20 axis .",
    "it is contrary to the usual mathematical convention ; therefore , the mean curvature @xmath23 is @xmath24 , in which @xmath25 denotes the principal curvature along the parallels of latitude , and @xmath26 denotes that along those of meridian .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the spontaneous curvature @xmath9 carries a sign . when the normal of a surface change its direction , @xmath27 and @xmath9 must change their signs simultaneously .",
    "keeping the directions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the usual , we have consequently @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the normal of the surface and @xmath30 the azimuthal angle .    for self - consistence ,",
    "the positive direction of arclength @xmath31 along the contour in @xmath32 plane is necessary to start from the north pole of the shape .",
    "if so , we see that the parameterization for sphere is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radius of the sphere , and our sign convention used in this paper is then compatible with that used in most previous works@xcite . the third order nonlinear differential equation ( 3 ) can be simplified to be a second order one@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath0 is a constant of integration .",
    "it is still a rather complicated equation and does not belong to any known type of well - studied differential equation in mathematics .    under the conditions that both the surface tension @xmath11 and the osmotic pressure difference @xmath10 are zero , i.e. , @xmath36 an analytic cbs solution for the eq.(3 ) @xcite , or eq . ( 5 ) with @xmath37 , is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath40 .",
    "when we first obtained this solution@xcite , we concentrated on the fact that it can be used to represent the cbs of usual red blood cells@xcite .",
    "in fact , by adjusting parameter @xmath9 in the interval @xmath41 , the formula ( [ sin ] ) can give a family of shapes , which is what we are going to analyze in detail .",
    "for sake of convenience , we mainly use the first form of the cbs solution ( [ sin ] ) with @xmath42 .",
    "before presenting the shapes , we would like to make two comments on how to characterize the shapes .",
    "first , for each shape , we will give both the parameterization and the interval of @xmath43 in which the shape appears .",
    "this is because that there may be different shapes represented by the same parameterization in distinct intervals of @xmath43 as long as in the intervals @xmath44 are satisfied .",
    "second , even the scale invariance will be fully studied in section v , we will follow the usual usage@xcite to give for each shape the scale invariant @xmath45 , in which @xmath46 with @xmath47 denoting the area of the surface of the shape . unless specially mentioned and discussed , that the normals of the surface point outwards for closed shapes is always implied .",
    "all possible types of shapes represented by eq .",
    "( [ sin ] ) are listed in the following .",
    "\\i ) the flat plane ( trivial case ) with @xmath48 : @xmath49.\\ ] ]    \\ii ) the sphere with @xmath48 : @xmath50.\\ ] ]    \\iii ) the prolate ellipsoid .",

    "the parameterization @xmath61 , @xmath62 $ ] represents the same shape but with inwards pointing normal .",

    "is shown in fig.2(d ) and its parameterization is @xmath66.\\ ] ]    \\vii ) the self - intersecting inverted cbs .",
    "a typical shape with @xmath67 is shown in fig.2(e ) and its parameterization is @xmath68 .",
    "\\label{selcb}\\ ] ] to note that in this case , the outside of this shape can be defined but we can not let the normal always point outwards using a single parameterization ( [ selcb ] ) .",
    "the normal of the parameterization ( [ selcb ] ) points outwards only at the surface of the torus part .",
    "\\viii ) the self - intersecting nodoidlike cylinder .",
    "this situation was discussed in previous paper@xcite .",
    "we add a typical figure , fig.2(f ) , in this paper for completeness .",
    "the cylinder is infinitely long with periodic packing , along the rotational axis , of a basic unit in which self - intersecting occurs once .",
    "we plot the basic unit only .",
    "we use the surface of the basic unit to calculate @xmath69 and the shape has @xmath70 . its parameterization is @xmath71.\\ ] ] the normal of this parameterization points outwards only at the surface of the torus part also . to note that the same parameterization @xmath72 in interval @xmath73 $ ] gives a capped cylinder but its normal points inwards .",
    "these eight shapes consist of all possible types of shapes containing in the solution . from the parameterizations of the these shapes ,",
    "one may have noticed two facts that the spontaneous curvatures of all shapes are within a very narrow domain instead of infinite domain of @xmath74 , and a single shape may have different parameterizations .",
    "explanations of these facts will be given in next section by both qualitative and quantitative studies of the cbs solution .",
    "all the closed shapes ( ii)-(vii ) presented in last section can be grouped into two branches : the prolate ellipsoid including ( ii)-(iv ) and oblate ellipsoid branch including ( ii ) , ( v)-(vii ) , and these two branches are bifurcated from a sphere ( ii ) .",
    "it is easily understandable if looking into the cbs solution ( [ sin ] ) @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath34 and @xmath76 , this form gives nothing but sphere of radius @xmath39 .",
    "then when @xmath9 is a small quantity , positive @xmath9 leads to oblate ellipsoid and negative @xmath9 leads to prolate ellipsoid respectively .",
    "what if @xmath9 is large is not so evident and needs some reasoning .    for analyzing how @xmath9 affects the shapes and the intervals of @xmath20 such that @xmath77",
    ", we use the parameterization @xmath78 , and sketch the relation of @xmath79 with positive @xmath9 vs. @xmath20 in fig.3 .    from this figure",
    ", we see that @xmath80 is a single - valued and monotonous function of @xmath20 ; and it reaches its extremum at point @xmath81 which satisfies @xmath82 the extremum value of @xmath83 is @xmath84 which is negative for positive @xmath9 and vice verse . taking the positive @xmath9 as an example in fig .",
    "3 , corresponding to different @xmath9 , shapes can appear in different intervals of @xmath20 .",
    "there are three different cases of @xmath85 .",
    "i ) when @xmath9 is critical such that @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 from eq.([max ] ) .",
    "the meridian principal curvature vanishes at point @xmath81 as @xmath88 : it is the unphysically infinitely long capped cylinder with radius @xmath89 from eq .",
    "( [ max ] ) .",
    "ii ) when @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 and shapes appear in one interval @xmath92 $ ] in which @xmath93 are the equatorial radii of the shapes such that @xmath94 . along the increase of @xmath20 from @xmath95 to @xmath93 ,",
    "the tangent angle @xmath22 decreases from zero and reaches its minimum at point @xmath81 , then increases monotonously and reaches its maximum value @xmath96 at point @xmath93 .",
    "these shapes certainly belong to the oblate ellipsoid branch , and their normals point outwards from eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) .",
    "iii ) when @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 , shapes can appear in two distinct intervals @xmath99 $ ] , in which @xmath100 are the equatorial radii of the shapes such that @xmath101 , and @xmath102 $ ] , because in both intervals @xmath44 is satisfied . in interval",
    "@xmath99 $ ] , the tangent angle @xmath22 decreases from zero and terminates at @xmath103 .",
    "these shapes certainly belong to the prolate ellipsoid branch , but the normals point inwards since @xmath104 holds for whole interval @xmath105 $ ] . in distinct interval",
    "@xmath102 $ ] , numerical studies show that only the self - intersection nodoidlike cylinder appears .",
    "in fact , using the parameterization @xmath75 , each shape with a @xmath9 outside the domain @xmath106 can be found an identical shape with a value of @xmath107 within the domain @xmath108 .",
    "for demonstrating this fact , we resort to the second form of the cbs solution @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ sin ] ) .",
    "two parameterizations @xmath110 and @xmath111 represent the same shape , but one s normal is opposite to another s from eq.([normal ] ) .",
    "if requiring that the normal points outwards , one of these two parameterizations must be eliminated .",
    "furthermore we have a simplified form @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the dimensionless length , and @xmath114 is a dimensionless spontaneous curvature .",
    "one can find that the @xmath115 in two separate domains @xmath116 and @xmath117 , in which @xmath118 is the base of the natural logarithm , suffice to give all possible shapes with normals pointing outwards in the cbs solution .",
    "when @xmath119 , the shapes are unphysically infinitely long capped cylinders . from the relation @xmath120 and letting @xmath42 , all shapes can be mapped into a single domain @xmath121 in parameterization @xmath75 .",
    "this is why there are only a few of spontaneous curvature @xmath9 within a narrow domain in the last section are sufficient to give all possible types of shapes in the cbs solution , i.e. , why each shape with a @xmath9 outside the domain @xmath106 can be found an identical shape with a value of @xmath107 within the domain @xmath122 .",
    "in addition to the above qualitative analyses , numerical method will be used to characterize quantitatively the shapes in whole domain @xmath123 .",
    "we introduce two ratios , semi - axis ratio @xmath124 and reduced radius ratio @xmath125 . the so - called semi - axis @xmath126 is defined by the half of the distance of two poles of a vesicle in the symmetrical axis @xmath21 , which is @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the equatorial radius of the vesicle satisfying @xmath129 .",
    "the ratios @xmath124 are plotted by dashed lines in fig .",
    "4 . from fig .",
    "4(b ) , the @xmath9 approaches @xmath130 and @xmath131 , the ratio @xmath124 approaches infinity : the shapes are infinitely long capped cylinders with radii @xmath132 and @xmath133 respectively .",
    "when @xmath9 increases from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , the ratio decreases monotonously .",
    "we have in sequence the capped cylinder , the prolate ellipsoid and the sphere of unit radius at @xmath76 , the oblate ellipsoid with a small positive @xmath9 , the cbs and the center of the cbs touches at @xmath134 , then self - intersecting inverted cbs . from fig .",
    "4(a ) and fig .",
    "4(c ) , we clearly see that when @xmath135 or @xmath97 , the ratios @xmath124 are greater than @xmath132 .",
    "we have in sequence the capped cylinder , the prolate ellipsoid and the quasi - sphere with increasing @xmath136 .",
    "when @xmath136 approaches infinity , the constraint @xmath44 means that @xmath100 , cf .",
    "3 , must be very small .",
    "thus we have approximately @xmath137 for positive and negative @xmath9 respectively using l hospital method .",
    "it implys that we will have sphere again .",
    "all these shapes are closed and appear in intervals of @xmath20 including the point @xmath138 , which are physically interesting and are plotted in the fig .",
    "4 . when @xmath135 or @xmath97 , in intervals @xmath139 $ ] ( cf .",
    "3 ) , we have the self - intersecting nodoidlike cylinders , which are less physically interesting and have not been plotted in the fig .",
    "4 . as pointed out in @xcite , along with the increasing @xmath136 , the number of self - intersections in unit length increases and it approaches a quasi - torus as @xmath136 approaches @xmath140 .",
    "in fact , when @xmath141 , the self - intersecting nodoidlike also appear in the intervals @xmath139 $ ] , but along with the decreasing @xmath136 , the number of self - intersections in unit length increases .",
    "the second ratio is @xmath125 , in which @xmath142 is defined by the radius of the sphere having the same volume @xmath143 of a vesicle and @xmath69 the radius of the sphere having the same area @xmath47 of the vesicle . the volume @xmath143 and area @xmath47 are @xmath144 undoubtedly , we have @xmath145 and the equality holds for sphere only .",
    "the ratio is plotted by dot - dashed lines in fig.4 .",
    "the scale invariant @xmath45 is plotted by thin solid lines in fig .",
    "4 . in fig .",
    "4(c ) , we plot both @xmath45 ( above the @xmath9 axis ) and @xmath146 ( below the @xmath9 axis ) by the same thin solid lines , in order to see the fact that each shape with a @xmath147 is identical to a shape with a @xmath148 and vice verse . but the normals of shapes parameterized by @xmath149 with @xmath150 point inwards .    from both the qualitative and quantitative studies in this section",
    ", we can draw a conclusion that all possible closed shapes in the cbs solution ( 8) are , along with @xmath9 increasing from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , the capped cylinder , the prolate ellipsoid , the sphere , the oblate ellipsoid , the cbs , and the self - intersecting inverted cbs .",
    "an important property of the local curvature energy is its scale invariance .",
    "this energy does not depend on the size of the vesicle but only on its shape@xcite .",
    "if @xmath151 is a solution with a local curvature energy , the rescaled shape @xmath152 with @xmath153 , and consequently @xmath154 , is also a solution with the same local curvature energy .",
    "two parameterizations of the cbs solution ( 8) having manifest scale invariance are @xmath155 in which @xmath128 is a constant with length unit as @xmath20 or @xmath39 .",
    "it is evident that the two products @xmath45 and @xmath156 are two scale invariants independent of a particularly chosen parameterization .",
    "we used two particular parameterizations , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , to search for the minimum energy shape .",
    "both gives the same result @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the minimum energy is @xmath161 ; hereafter we take the energy of sphere @xmath162 as the energy unit .",
    "surprisingly , the cbs with touching center at @xmath134 has energy @xmath163 . in fig .",
    "4 ( b ) , the thick solid line shows that there is a energy minimum shape with @xmath164 : it is a cbs . in general , the oblate ellipsoids including the cbs have lower energy than other shapes including the sphere , prolate ellipsoid and the self - intersecting inverted cbs have .",
    "even all the previous numerical studies concentrated on the solution of equation when @xmath1 of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the obtained shapes @xcite included all the eight shapes above . and also",
    ", all these eight shapes except the self - intersecting cases have been observed in laboratory@xcite .",
    "since our solution belongs to the situation @xmath165 of eq.(5 ) , our results coincide with the known theoretical results in one respect but differ from in the other .",
    "first , our approach supports the conclusion that the prolate ellipsoids may have higher energy than the oblate ones have@xcite .",
    "however , the standard instability analysis of a sphere starts from a slightly deformed sphere of parameterized form @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a set of small parameters corresponding to spherical harmonics @xmath168 . for small @xmath167 , for example the only nonvanishing @xmath169 satisfying @xmath170 , the ellipsoids have @xmath171 contour curves .",
    "but our ellipsoids have only @xmath172 contour curves , we must stress that the @xmath172 continuity suffices to ensure that the membranes are free from any force acting on the any point , otherwise the contour curve may be @xmath173 .",
    "the second derivative of @xmath174 with respect to @xmath20 is singular at point @xmath138 .",
    "one may feel uneasy of this singularity .",
    "in fact , it relates to energy density only , and the total energies @xmath175 are limited as shown in fig.4 .",
    "second , the infinitely long capped cylinders appear when @xmath176 and @xmath177 , and they correspond the infinite energy states , as shown by thick solid lines in fig.4 ( a)-(c ) . from our results ,",
    "the phases between the two sides of @xmath176 and @xmath177 are separate .",
    "the latter @xmath131 distinguishes a oblate ellipsoid and a prolate ellipsoid phase ; it is the same situation in the known phase diagram@xcite .",
    "however when @xmath9 changes from @xmath90 to @xmath97 , the normal changes its direction from pointing outwards to pointing inwards .",
    "it seems that the membrane takes a global flip - flop procedure .",
    "but no such procedure takes place when @xmath9 changes from @xmath135 to @xmath178 even the transitions are also discontinuous .",
    "third , there is an interesting number appeared both in our results and the previous ones , @xmath179 .",
    "we see that from the fig .",
    "4(b ) when @xmath180 where @xmath42 in our parameterization , the cbs has the minimum energy . in the usual instability analysis of a sphere via infinitesimal deformation , the infinitesimally deformed oblate shape has the lower energy and more stable than the infinitesimally deformed prolate one whenever @xmath181@xcite .",
    "an analytic solution for helfrich spontaneous curvature membrane model @xcite , which has a conspicuous feature of representing the circular biconcave shape , is systematically studied in this paper .",
