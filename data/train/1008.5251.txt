    "as the fast propagation of action potentials along the axon is of fundamental importance in the nervous system , e.g. for the successful evolution to large body sizes of organisms , or the information processing in the brain , the study of the propagation mechanisms is of great interest for neuroscientists , physiologists and physicists  @xcite . since the empirical modeling proposed by hodgkin and huxley in 1952  @xcite , the neuronal firing dynamics with respect to spike generation and signal propagation are successfully studied within this deterministic modeling . in recent days",
    ", issues relating to the constructive role of noise on these dynamics were addressed @xcite .",
    "the noise - assisted enhancement in weak signals transmission , transduction or detection has been investigated , e.g. in the context of noise supported wave propagation in sub - excitable media  @xcite or in excitable systems  @xcite .",
    "the conductance fluctuation of the neuronal membranes which arises from random channel opening and closing can , _ a priori _ not be neglected  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was shown , that this intrinsic _ channel noise _",
    "@xcite can lead to generation of so - called _ spontaneous action potentials _ , to synchronization phenomena like _ stochastic resonance _",
    "@xcite and _ coherence resonance _",
    "@xcite and to synchronization of ion channel clusters  @xcite .",
    "even the saltatory spike propagation which results from a highly non - uniform distribution of the ion channel , can take benefit of the intrinsic channel noise as we have shown recently in ref .",
    "the saltatory spike propagation occurs in myelinated axons where the activating sodium ion channels are concentrated at the nodes of ranvier , which are separated by segments sheathed with myelin .",
    "this results in a much faster propagation speed in myelinated axons than that in un - myelinated axons with constant ion channel density  @xcite .    with this work , we extend our prior study  @xcite on the effect of channel noise on the propagation of action potentials along myelinated axons . in terms of transmission reliability",
    "we are discussing the influence of the coupling strength between neighboring nodes of ranvier and that of strong intrinsic noise .",
    "in order to model the signal transmission along myelinated axons , we consider a compartmental stochastic hodgkin - huxley model @xcite .",
    "accordingly , each node of ranvier is modeled by a stochastic generalization of the hodgkin - huxley model , which extends the applicability of the original hodgkin - huxley model @xcite towards stochastic dynamics of the membrane potential of finite - size ion channel clusters @xcite .",
    "each node of ranvier couples linearly to its nearest neighbors .",
    "consequently , the membrane dynamics @xmath0 at the @xmath1th node of ranvier reads ( with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 corresponds to the total number of axonal nodes of ranvier ) :        [ eq : compartmentmodel ] @xmath4    and the external current stimuli @xmath5 at the @xmath1th node of ranvier . in eq .",

    "( [ eq : conductances - hodgkinhuxley ] ) , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the maximum potassium and sodium conductances per unit area , when all ion channels within the corresponding node are open . for simplicity , we assume that every axonal node has the same kinetics , i.e. the same number of sodium and potassium ion channels",
    ". so the maximum potassium and sodium conductances @xmath16 and @xmath17 are identical constants for every node of ranvier .",
    "the gating variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eqs .   and , describe the open probabilities of the ion channel gates in the @xmath1th node , and undergo a stochastic process which stems from a birth - and - death - like process of the gating dynamics .",

    "@xmath22 are gaussian white noise with vanishing mean and vanishing cross - correlations .",

    "we start with the deterministic limit which is formally achieved in the limit @xmath52 , using @xmath33 . in this case",
    ", the transmission reliability @xmath53 depends solely on the inter - nodal coupling strength @xmath8 and exhibits distinguished transmission patterns @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the transmission reliability @xmath53 on the coupling strength is depicted in fig.[fig : detdyn ] . for sub - threshold coupling ,",
    "i.e. @xmath47 the ratio equals zero and no spike propagation to the final node is observed .",
    "contrary , for sufficiently large coupling parameter , i.e. @xmath54 , each generated action potential propagates along the axon and arrives at the final node , i.e. @xmath55 .",
    "discrete , rational transmission patterns @xmath51 appear for intermediate values of the coupling parameter .      when considering finite sizes @xmath23 of the nodes of ranvier , the staircase - like dependence of the transmission reliability parameter @xmath56 , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : detdyn ] for the deterministic case ( i.e. for the case of an infinite size of the nodes of ranvier ) , turns in a continuous dependence ( not shown ) .",
    "is plotted against the membranal size of the node of ranvier for different strengths of the inter - nodal coupling ( the coupling strengths are given in units of @xmath57 ) .",
    "the data confirms the result of noise - assisted spike propagation for sub - threshold coupling ( see dashed red line ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the minimum in @xmath53 indicates the cross - over from a stochastic , uncorrelated spiking of the initial and final nodes towards a causal , noisy spike transmission from the initial to the final node . ]    in the limit of strong intrinsic noise , i.e. for the finite size of the nodes of ranvier approaching formally zero , the channel noise reigns the dynamics of the membrane potential of each node and the influence of the bi - linear coupling becomes negligible .",
    "consequently , in this limit the causal relationship between spiking in the first and that one of the terminal node gets lost . the number of spike occurrences at the final node does not markedly depend on the actual value of the coupling parameter and the ratio @xmath53 tends to a value independent of coupling strength @xmath8 , cf .",
    "[ fig : stochdyn ] .",
    "note , that in this case , the information transfer from an initial to a final node fades towards zero as the correlation between spikes in the initial and the final node diminishes .",
    "moreover , the spontaneous spikes stimulates via the coupling the neighboring nodes and consequently a transmission to both sides occurs , cf .",
    "[ fig : vt ] ( c ) . in the limit @xmath58 , the initial and the terminal node are spiking independently .",
    "consequently , @xmath53 is given by the ratio of the number of spontaneous spikes occurring within the non - stimulated , stochastic hodgkin - huxley dynamics and the number of spikes occurring within the stochastic hodgkin - huxley dynamics complemented by a constant current stimulus of @xmath59 .",
    "surely , the causal relationship is lost in this case .",
    "this becomes evident when considering the cross - correlation between the spiking of the initial and that of the final node ( see below ) .    with increasing size of the nodes of the ranvier @xmath60 ,",
    "i.e. with decreasing channel noise strength , the transmission becomes more regular , cf .",
    "[ fig : vt ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the causal relationship is restored in this limit and the transmission coefficient @xmath53 tends to its deterministic limit .",
    "this cross - over from the stochastic non - causal firing regime to the regime of noisy spike transmission depends on the coupling strength . for smaller coupling strengths",
    ", this cross - over occurs at larger nodal membrane sizes @xmath23 , cf .",
    "[ fig : stochdyn ] .    starting out from the weak noise limit , an increase in the noise strength results in a noise - assisted spike propagation phenomenon for sub - threshold coupling as pointed out before with ref .",
    "the transmission reliability exhibits a maximum , indicating an optimal , noise assisted spike propagation , cf .",
    "[ fig : stochdyn ] . in this case",
    "the coupling between the nodes does not result in an efficient propagation of the spikes and the presence of intrinsic noise is necessary to overcome the threshold for excitation .",
    "however , for the supra - threshold coupling , the channel noise leads to noise - induced propagation failures and the transmission reliability coefficient @xmath53 firstly decreases with increasing noise level , cf .",
    "[ fig : stochdyn ] . the observed increase of @xmath53 for strong intrinsic noise is attributed to the cross - over to the stochastic , non - causal firing regime accompanied by uncorrelated spiking in the initial and final nodes .    in order to analyze the spike correlation between the initial and final node , we firstly segmented the point processes @xmath61 and @xmath62 in segments of width @xmath63 . for @xmath63",
    "smaller than the refractory time , there is either no spike or one spike observable in each segment . for our analysis",
    ", we chose @xmath64 .",
    "secondly , we determine the number of spike coincidences @xmath65 between the initial node and the final node in the segments of width @xmath63 , i.e. the spike coincidences between the two point processes @xmath61 and @xmath66 : @xmath67 in eq .",
    "[ eq : nosc ] , @xmath68 denotes the total integration time .",
    "note , that the above definition corresponds to a cross - correlation measure .",
    "thirdly , we relate this number @xmath65 to the number of initiated spikes at node `` 0 '' , i.e. @xmath69 , and the bin - width @xmath63 .",
    "we obtain the probability density @xmath70 : @xmath71 note , that due to the periodic spike initiation at the first node , @xmath70 is periodic , cf .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] .",
    "the normalization to the total number of initiated spikes @xmath69 ensures that the integral of @xmath70 over one period results in the transmission coefficient @xmath53 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) .",
    "a sharp peak in @xmath70 indicates a high correlation .",
    "for supra - threshold coupling and weak intrinsic noise , the correlation measure @xmath70 exhibits a sharp peak for a @xmath72-value , which corresponds to the propagation time modulo the period of the spiking in the initial node , cf .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] ( b ) . with increasing noise level ,",
    "the width of the peak increases and the height of the peak compared to the background level decreases until the total disappearance of the peak in the background showing the lost of any causal correlation .",
    "interestingly , for the sub - threshold case , not only a broadening and flattening of the peak can be observed with increasing noise level , but also a shift of the peak towards smaller @xmath72-values showing a speed up of the transmission , cf .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] ( a ) .",
    "the latter can be explained by the same line of reasoning as drawn by the effect of _ anticipated synchronization _ in ref .",
    "we numerically studied the saltatory spike propagation along a myelinated axon within a multi - compartmental , stochastic hodgkin - huxley modeling .",
    "the channel noise affecting the dynamics of the bi - linearly coupled nodes of ranvier is originated in the random ion channel gating . upon analyzing the spike propagation in terms of transmission reliability ,",
    "i.e. the ratio of the number of spike observed in the terminal node to the number of spikes initiated in the first node , we found a reduction of the transmission reliability with increasing channel noise level for supra - threshold coupling .",
    "this is due to the noise induced propagation failures .",
    "a further increase of the channel noise level leads to the total loss of the spiking correlation between the first and the last node of ranvier of the axonal chain . in case of sub - threshold coupling and not so high channel noise level",
    ", the channel noise can constructively contribute to the spike propagation and the effect of noise - assisted spike propagation is recovered .",
    "both the transmission reliability as well as the propagation speed can increase with increasing channel noise level .",
    "this observed behavior is quite in spirit of the stochastic resonance phenomenon @xcite with an intrinsic noise source @xcite with the inter - nodal coupling playing the role of an nodal stimulus . + the authors like to applaud and warmly thank lutz schimansky - geier for his continuous engagement in furthering stochastic physics within the statistical physics community worldwide and for his many elucidative discussions with us in pursuing stochastic physics .",
