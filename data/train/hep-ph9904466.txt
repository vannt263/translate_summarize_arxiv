    "a few years ago we have proposed a quark - parton model of cumulative phenomena in the interactions with nuclei @xcite based on perturbative qcd calculations of the corresponding quark diagrams near the thresholds , at which other quarks ( `` donors '' ) in the nuclear flucton transfer all their longitudinal momenta to the distinguished active quark and become soft .",
    "consider the scattering of a hadronic projectile off a nucleus with the momentum @xmath2 in the c.m . system . at high energies the momentum @xmath3 of the produced pion belongs to the cumulative region if @xmath4 . as a reasonable first approximation",
    ", we treat the nucleus as a collection of @xmath5 valence quarks , which , on the average , carry each longitudinal momentum @xmath6 with @xmath7 . in our approach the cumulative pion production proceeds in two steps .",
    "first a valence quark with a scaling variable @xmath8 is created .",
    "afterwards it decays into the observed hadron with its scaling variable @xmath1 close to the initial cumulative quark s one .",
    "this second step is described by the well - known quark fragmentation functions @xcite and will not be discussed here .",
    "the produced cumulative ( `` active '' ) quark acquires the momentum much greater than @xmath6 only if this quark has interacted by means of gluon exchanges with other @xmath9 quarks of flucton ( `` donors '' ) and has taken some of their longitudinal momenta ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "if this active quark accumulates all longitudinal momentum of these @xmath9 quarks then @xmath10 and the donors become soft . it is well - known that interactions which make the longitudinal momentum of one of the quark equal to zero may be treated by perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this allows to calculate the part of fig .",
    "1 responsible for the creation of a cumulative quark explicitly .",
    "this was done in @xcite , to which papers we refer the reader for all the details . as a result",
    "we were able to explain the exponential fall - off of the production rate in the cumulative region .    since with the rise of @xmath1 the active quark has to interact with a greater number of donors , one expects that its average transverse momentum also grows with @xmath1 .",
    "roughly one expects that @xmath11 is proportional to the number of interactions , that is , to @xmath1 . in @xcite",
    "this point was not studied : we have limited ourselves with the inclusive cross - section integrated over the transverse momenta , which lead to some simplifications .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to find the pion production rate dependence on the transverse momentum and the mean value of the latter as a function of @xmath1 in the cumulative region .",
    "this dependence and also the magnitude of @xmath11 have been studied experimentally .",
    "the comparison of our predictions with the data allows to obtain further support for our model and fix one of the two its parameters ( the infrared cutoff ) .",
    "repeating the calculations of the diagram in fig.1 described in @xcite but not limiting ourselves with the inclusive cross - section integrated over the transverse momentum , we readily find that all dependence upon the transverse momentum @xmath0 of the produced particle is concentrated in a factor : j ( k_)= _ a(_p+1|_p+1 ) g(c_1, ... ,c_p ) _ i=1^p ( c_i - r)(c_i-)d^2 c_i e^i(-r)k _ d^2 r d^2 here @xmath12 is the ( translationally invariant ) quark density matrix of the nucleus : _",
    "a(r_i|_i)_a(r_i , r_m ) ^*_a(_i , r_m ) _ m = p+2^n d^2 r_m where @xmath13 is the transverse part of the nuclear quark wave function .",
    "the propgation of soft donor quarks is decribed by ( c)= [ lam ] where @xmath14 is the constituent quark mass and @xmath15 is the modified bessel function ( the mac - donald function ) .",
    "the interaction with the projectile contributes a factor g(c_1, ...",
    ",c_p)= _ i=1^p _ qq(c_i - b_i ) _ h(b_1, ...",
    ",b_p ) d^2 b_i where @xmath16 is the quark - quark cross - section at a given value of impact parameter @xmath17 and _",
    ",b_p)= _ lp    distribution in the projectile , expressed via the transverse part of its partonic wave function @xmath18 .",
    "if we integrate @xmath19 over @xmath0 we come back to our old result ( eq .",
    "( 33 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath20    if one assumes factorization of the multiparton distribution @xmath21 then + @xmath22 also factorizes : g(c_1, ... ,c_p)= _ i=1^p g_0(c_i ) [ facg ] following @xcite we use the quasi - eikonal approximation for @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the quasi - eikonal diffraction factor , @xmath26 is the mean number of partons in the projectile hadron and the single parton distribution @xmath27 is normalized to unity . in a gaussian approximation for @xmath28 and @xmath27",
    "we find : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total quark - quark cross - section , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the widths of @xmath28 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "with the factorised @xmath22 ( [ facg ] ) we have @xmath34 where @xmath35",
    "we also have used the translational invariance of the @xmath36-matrix . note that near the real threshold we have no spectators and @xmath37 in any case large @xmath0 corresponds to small @xmath38 so we factor @xmath12 out of the integral in zero point . in the rest integral we pass to the variables @xmath39 and shift the integration variable @xmath17 , then j ( k_)= _ a(_p+1|_p+1 ) j^p(b , b ) e^ibk _ d^2 b d^2 b where j(b , b)= g_0(b+c ) ( -c ) ( + c ) d^2 c [ j ]",
    "now we would like to find the width of the distribution on @xmath0 as a function of @xmath9 or what is the same of the cumulative number @xmath41 . from the mathematical point of view",
    "it is simpler to calculate the mean squared width of the distribution @xmath42 .",
    "unfortunately in our case this quantity is logarithmically divergent at large @xmath0 .",
    "this divergency results from the behavior of @xmath43 at small @xmath44 . this behavior is determined by the behavior of the @xmath45 ( [ lam ] ) , which has a logarithmical singularity at @xmath46 .",
    "smooth @xmath47 does not affect this behavior .",
    "for this reason we shall rather calculate @xmath40 : |k_|= j^p(b , b ) |k_|e^ibk _ d^2 b d^2 b where @xmath48 is the same integral as in the numerator but without @xmath49 . presenting @xmath49 as @xmath50 and @xmath51 as the laplacian @xmath52 applied to the exponent we find @xmath53 twice integrating by parts and using the formula @xmath54 we find @xmath55",
    "now we again integrate by parts once to find @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "this leads to our final formula |k_|=- d^2 b j^p-1(b , b ) ( n_b _ b ) j(b , b ) [ kperp ] where @xmath43 is given by ( [ j ] ) , @xmath58 is given by ( [ lam ] ) and @xmath59",
    "to simplify numerical calculations we make some additional approximations , which are not very essential but are well supported by the comparison with exact calulations at a few sample points .    as follows from the the asymptotics of @xmath60 at large @xmath61 @xmath62 the width of @xmath63 ( [ lam ] )",
    "is of the order @xmath64 .",
    "the function @xmath65 is smooth in the vicinity of the origin and its width @xmath66 is substancially larger than the width of @xmath67 .",
    "for this reason we factor @xmath47 out of the integral ( [ j ] ) over @xmath17 at the point @xmath68 : j(b , b)= g_0(b)(b ) , 1 ( b ) ( c ) ( c - b ) d^2 c= k_1(m|b| ) [ lam ] then we find that the integrals over @xmath68 and @xmath44 decouple j ( k_)= _ a(_p+1|_p+1 ) g^p_0(b ) d^2 b ^p(b ) e^ibk _ d^2 b    in this approximation we find that @xmath40 depends only on one parameter - the constituent quark mass @xmath14 , which in our approach plays the role of an infrared cutoff : |k_|=pm _ 0^ dz k_0(z ) ( zk_1(z))^p-1 [ apprkperp ] this allows to relate @xmath14 directly to the experimental data on the transverse momentum dependence .",
    "the integral in ( [ apprkperp ] ) can be easy calculated numerically . for values of @xmath69 it is very well approximated by a power dependence ( see fig.2 ) , so that we obtain |k_|/m = 1.594 p^0.625 as we observe , the rise of @xmath70 turns out to be even faster than expected on naive physical grounds mentioned in the introduction ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the resulting plots for @xmath72 as a function of the cumulative number @xmath41 at different values of parameter @xmath14 are shown in fig.3 together with avaiable experimental data from @xcite on @xmath73 for pion production obtained in experiments @xcite-@xcite with 10 @xmath74 protons and @xcite with 8.94 @xmath74 protons .",
    "note that earlier publications of the first group @xcite reported a much stronger increase of @xmath73 with @xmath1 , up to value 2 @xmath75 at @xmath76 for pion production . in our approach",
    "such an increase would require the quark mass to be as high as @xmath77 . in a more recent publication @xcite",
    "the rise of @xmath73 is substancially weaker ( it corresponds to @xmath78 in our approach ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite explain this by new experimental data obtained and by a cutoff @xmath79 introduced in calculations of @xmath73 in @xcite .",
    "the introduction of this cutoff considerably ( approximatly two times ) decreases the experimental value of @xmath73 at @xmath76 . in our opinion",
    "this is a confirmation that the cumulative pion production rate only weakly decreases with @xmath0 in the cumulative region so that the the integral over @xmath51 which enters the definition of @xmath73 is weakly convergent or even divergent , as in our approach .",
    "undoubtedly presentation of the experimental data in terms of the mean value @xmath80 , rather than @xmath73 should reduce the dependence on the cutoff @xmath79 and make the results more informative .",
    "one of the ideas behind the investigations of the cumulative phenomena is that they may be a manifestation of a cold quark - gluon plasma formed when several nucleons overlap in the nuclear matter . in @xcite",
    "we pointed out that our model does not correspond to this picture .",
    "it implies coherent interactions of the active quark with donors and , as a result , strong correlations between the longitudinal and transverse motion .",
    "predictions for the dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath1 are also different . from the cold quark - gluon plasma model one",
    "expects @xmath81 to behave as @xmath82 , since the fermi momentum of the quarks inside the overlap volume is proportional to the cubic root of the quark density .",
    "our model predicts a much faster increase , with a power twice larger .",
    "the experimental data seem to support our predictions .",
    "the authors are greatly thankful to prof .",
