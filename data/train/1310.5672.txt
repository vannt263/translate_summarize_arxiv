    "in the last few years , there has been an enormousamount of empirical work in understanding properties of real - world networks , especially data transmission networks such as the internet .",
    "one functional which has witnessed intense study and motivated an enormous amount of literature is the _ degree distribution _ of the network .",
    "many real - world networks are observed to have a _ heavy - tailed _ degree distribution .",
    "more precisely , empirical data suggest that if we look at the empirical proportion @xmath1 of nodes with degree @xmath2 , then @xmath3 the quantity @xmath4 is called the _ degree exponent _ of the network and plays an important role in predicting a wide variety of properties , ranging from the typical distance between different nodes , robustness and fragility of the network , to diffusion properties of viruses and epidemics ; see @xcite and the references therein .    in practice ,",
    "such network properties often can not be directly measured and are estimated via indirect observations .",
    "the degree of a given node , or whether two given nodes are linked by an edge , may not be directly observable .",
    "one method to overcome this issue is to send probes from a single source node to every other node in the network , tracking the paths that these probes follow .",
    "this procedure , known as _ multicast _ , gives partial information about the underlying network , from which the true structure of the network must be inferred ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "probes sent between nodes to explore the structure of such networks are assumed to follow _",
    "shortest paths _ in the following sense .",
    "these networks are described not only by their graph structure but also by costs or weights across edges , representing congestion across the edge or economic costs for using it .",
    "the total weight of any given path is the sum of edge weights along the path . given a source node and a destination node ,",
    "a shortest path is a ( potentially nonunique ) path joining these nodes with smallest total weight .",
    "it is generally believed that the path that data actually takes is not the shortest path , but that the shortest path is an acceptable approximation of the actual path . for our models",
    ", the shortest paths between vertices will always be unique .    for a given source node",
    ", the union of the shortest paths to all other nodes of the network defines a subgraph of the underlying network , representing the part of the network that can be inferred from the multicast procedure . when all shortest paths are unique , which we assume henceforth , this subgraph is a tree , called the _",
    "shortest path tree_. this will be the main object of study in this paper .",
    "given the shortest path tree and its degree distribution , one can then attempt to infer the degree distribution of the whole network .",
    "empirical studies such as @xcite show that this may create a _",
    ", in the sense that the observed degree distribution of the tree might differ significantly from the degree distribution of the underlying network .",
    "thus a theoretical understanding of the shortest path tree , including its degree distribution and the lengths of paths between typical nodes , is of paramount interest .    by definition ,",
    "the unique path in the shortest path tree from the source @xmath5 to any given target vertex @xmath6 is the shortest path in the weighted network between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "thus the shortest path tree minimizes path lengths , not the total weight of a spanning tree .",
    "hence it is different from the _ minimal spanning tree _ , the tree for which the total weight over all edges is the tree is minimal .",
    "the last few years have seen a lot of interest in the statistical physics community for the study of disordered random systems that bridge these two regimes , with models proposed to interpolate between the shortest weight regime ( first passage percolation or weak disorder ) and the minimal spanning tree regime ( strong disorder ) ; see @xcite .",
    "consider a connected graph @xmath7 on @xmath8 vertices with edge lengths @xmath9 .",
    "now fix the disorder parameter @xmath10 , change the edge weights to @xmath11 and consider the shortest paths corresponding to the weights @xmath12 . for finite @xmath13",
    ", this is called the _ weak disorder _ regime . as @xmath14 , it is easy to check that the optimal path between any two vertices converges to the path between these two vertices in the minimal spanning tree where one uses the original edge weights @xmath15 to construct the minimal spanning tree .",
    "this is called the _",
    "strong disorder regime_. the parameter @xmath13 allows one to interpolate between these two regimes .",
    "understanding properties of the shortest path tree and its dependence on the parameter @xmath13 is then of relevance .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the degree distribution of shortest path trees , motivated by these questions from network sampling and statistical physics .      in order to gain insight into these properties ,",
    "we need to model ( a ) the underlying networks and ( b ) the edge weights .",
    "we shall study two main settings in this paper , the first motivated by network sampling issues and the second to understand weak disorder models .    _ configuration model with arbitrary edge weights _ : an array of models have been proposed to capture the structure of empirical networks , including preferential attachment - type models @xcite and , what is relevant to this study , the configuration model @xmath16 @xcite on @xmath8 vertices given a degree sequence @xmath17 which is constructed as follows .",

    "number the half - edges in any arbitrary order from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , and sequentially pair them uniformly at random to form complete edges .",
    "more precisely , at each stage pick an arbitrary unpaired half - edge and pair it to another uniformly chosen unpaired half - edge to form an edge .",
    "once paired , remove the two half - edges from the set of unpaired half - edges and continue the procedure until all half - edges are paired .",
    "call the resulting multi - graph @xmath16.=-1     of vertices having degree at least @xmath2 .",

    "although self - loops and multiple edges may occur , under mild conditions on the degree sequence @xmath27 , these become rare as @xmath28 ; see , for example , @xcite or @xcite for more precise results in this direction .",
    "for the edge weight distribution , we will assume any continuous distribution with a density .",
    "in the case of infinite - variance degrees , we need to make stronger assumptions and only work with exponential edge weights and independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "degrees having a power - law distribution .    _ weak disorder and the stochastic mean - field model _ :",
    "the complete graph can serve as an easy mean - field model for data transmission , and for many observables it gives a reasonably good approximation to the empirical data ; see @xcite .",
    "the complete graph with random exponential mean one edge weights is often refered to as the _ stochastic mean - field model of distance _ and has been one of the standard workhorses of probabilistic combinatorial optimization ; see @xcite and the references therein .",

    "we give an explicit probabilistic description of the limiting degree distribution that is intimately connected to the random fluctuations of the length of the optimal path .",
    "these in turn are intimately connected to bellman ",
    "jagers continuous - time branching processes ( ctbp ) describing local neighborhoods in these graphs . by analyzing these random fluctuations , we prove that the limiting degree distribution has markedly different behavior depending on the underlying graph :    _ configuration model _ : the shortest path tree has the _ same degree exponent _ @xmath4 as the underlying graph for _ any _ continuous edge weight distribution when @xmath33 , and for exponential mean one edge weights when @xmath34 .",
    "this reflects the fact that , for a vertex of unusually high degree in the underlying graph , almost all of its adjoining edges ( if @xmath33 ) or a positive fraction of its adjoining edges ( if @xmath35 ) are likely to belong to the shortest path tree .",
