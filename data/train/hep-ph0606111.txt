    "neutrino physics has become one of the most active areas of research in particle physics .",
    "there are many reasons for this development , one of the most important is that neutrino physics is a data driven field  for several years now , new data are pouring at an astounding rate .",
    "it began in with the first detection of supernova neutrinos .",
    "although only @xmath5 events were observed  @xcite , they allowed to confirm the standard picture of core - collapse supernov .",
    "furthermore those @xmath5 events also constitute the detection of the oldest neutrinos ever ; they were produced some @xmath6 years ago .",
    "the fact that there were detectable neutrinos after this time allows to put stringent bounds on the neutrino life time .",
    "furthermore the environment at the production site was a very special one  a dense and hot proto - neutron star .",
    "this offers the possibility to derive strong bounds on any additional interaction neutrinos could have .",
    "a comprehensive review on the properties of neutrinos which can be deduced from supernov is given in  @xcite .",
    "in super - k s atmospheric neutrino data  @xcite gave the first clear evidence for neutrino oscillation .",
    "this result was a real turning point for neutrino physics .",
    "neutrino oscillation implies that neutrinos do have a mass and the finding that the mixing angle is large was completely unexpected . in analogy to the quark sector",
    "the common belief was that if neutrinos mixed at all then the mixing angles should be small .",
    "the importance of the super - k result is that it is the first strong evidence for physics beyond the standard model . with the super - k result",
    "the number of publications per year containing the word neutrino in their title four - folded .",
    "the year was an annus mirabilis for neutrino physics .",
    "the solar neutrino puzzle was proven to be due to the properties of the neutrino and not of the sun .",
    "the neutral current data of sno  @xcite yielded an independent determination of the total flux of active neutrinos from the sun and in combination with other solar neutrino data proved that solar neutrinos undergo a flavor transition .",
    "kamland  @xcite provided an independent check of the oscillation hypothesis by using reactor neutrinos and constrained the mixing parameters to the so called solution .",
    "these two results together are extremely difficult to explain other than by neutrino oscillation .",
    "also the evidence for oscillation in atmospheric neutrinos has been confirmed independently by k2k  @xcite , which is the first long baseline experiment .",
    "furthermore two pioneers of neutrino physics were awarded the nobel prize .",
    "masatoshi koshiba was awarded one fourth of the prize for the detection of neutrinos from a supernova and ray davis jr .",
    "was awarded another fourth for his detection of solar neutrinos .",
    "a relatively recent review on the topic of neutrino oscillations in general is given in _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the above experiments indicate the presence of two mass splittings @xmath7 and @xmath8 , corresponding to solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , in agreement with existence of three active neutrinos . there has been a further experiment observing evidence for neutrino oscillation  lsnd .",
    "the results of this experiment indicate that there is a third mass splitting @xmath9 in the range @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the karmen experiment  @xcite on the other hand excludes a large part of the parameter region claimed by lsnd . in a combined analysis of both data sets there",
    "still remains a combined allowed region  @xcite .",
    "the third mass splitting can not be accommodated within a three neutrino flavor framework .",
    "basically two possible solutions exist  either there are more than three neutrinos , which means that the additional neutrinos are sterile in order not to create a conflict with the decay width of the @xmath11 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , or there is a huge -violation , which would make the mass splittings of neutrinos and of anti - neutrinos independent of each other .",
    "both solutions suffer from phenomenological problems , _",
    "i.e. _  they do not fit the existing data very well .",
    "finally miniboone will thoroughly test the results of lsnd .",
    "a fairly recent review of neutrino physics is to be found in  @xcite , which also contains an extensive bibliography .",
    "the current parameters are roughly @xmath12 this implies a lower bound on the mass of the heaviest neutrino @xmath13 but we currently do not know which neutrino is the heaviest . for a more detailed global analysis of the data",
    "see _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "we now can contrast our knowledge of the neutrino mixing with the quark sector @xmath14 the mixing of neutrinos is very different from that of quarks , since there are two large mixing angles .",
    "neutrino masses are also peculiar because they are at least five orders of magnitude smaller than the mass of the electron .",
    "these facts pose a major challenge to any theory of neutrino masses and mixings : why are neutrino masses so small ?",
    "why is the neutrino mixing pattern so different from that of the quarks ? what is the pattern of neutrino masses ?",
    "the standard model is in a paradox situation  it is extremely successful in describing elementary particles and their interactions and still it is strongly believed to be incomplete .",
    "it seems to be the correct description of the physics which can be observed at low energies but it is obvious from its structure that it can not be correct up to the very highest energies .",
    "this has inspired many attempts to provide a convincing model for the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "these attempts strongly suffered from the fact that no deviation from the standard model had been found before the discovery of neutrino flavor transitions .",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations is the first unequivocal experimental result which is beyond the sm .",
    "neutrinos within the sm are strictly massless , _",
    "i.e. _  it is impossible to write down a mass term for the neutrino which is gauge invariant and renormalizable .",
    "one possibility to approach this problem can be formulated in the language of effective field theory .",
    "the sm is believed to be an effective field theory , which means it is only valid up to some energy scale @xmath15 . at this scale",
    "new physics and degrees of freedom will appear . in the absence of a full theory for",
    "the new physics one still can write down a parameterization of the effects of the new physics in terms of non - renormalizable ( within the sm ) operators @xmath16 where the higher dimensional operators are suppressed by increasing powers of @xmath15 . in general",
    "there can be a large number of operators of a given dimension , _",
    "e.g. _  there are many dimension 6 operators , among them is the one responsible for proton decay . in that picture",
    "the first correction to the sm is expected to come from the dimension 5 operators @xmath17 since they are only suppressed by one power of @xmath15 .",
    "it turns out that there is only one dimension 5 operator , given by @xmath18 this operator is the neutrino mass operator .",
    "the fact that neutrino mass is the first correction to the sm which is expected from theory and found in experiment is a interesting coincidence .",
    "technically it is straightforward to generate the neutrino mass operator by introducing new degrees of freedom .",
    "the most commonly used choice are heavy right handed neutrinos @xmath19 , which are singlets under the sm gauge group . in that case",
    "it becomes possible to write down a majorana mass for the neutrinos @xmath20 this construction yields light neutrino masses of the order @xmath21 which is the famous seesaw relation .",
    "putting a typical fermion mass of @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the gut scale yields a neutrino mass of order @xmath24 .",
    "this value is tantalizing close to the order of magnitude indicated by oscillations . in this scheme",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses is natural consequence of the heaviness of the right handed neutrino .",
    "in such a scenario neutrino masses are a probe of very high energy scales which may otherwise be not accessible .",
    "it turns out that it is far from trivial to construct a theory which can account for the observed mixing pattern , _",
    "i.e. _  predict two large mixing angles .",
    "the seesaw mechanism is just one example and there a plethora of other possibilities .",
    "for some reviews on the vast amount of literature on these topics see  .",
    "the observable universe only contains matter and no anti - matter .",
    "this is a very surprising experimental fact since the initial condition are thought to be symmetric with respect to matter and anti - matter .",
    "baryogenesis aims at finding an explanation for the observed matter anti - matter asymmetry .",
    "it turns out that within the sm model it is in principle very well possible to create some asymmetry but the numerical value is way too small . for that reason this asymmetry points to physics beyond the sm .",
    "more surprisingly , the same new physics which is invoked to explain neutrino masses may be at the heart of baryogenesis .",
    "assuming that the universe was hot enough a some point in its history to keep @xmath19 in thermal equilibrium there will be a vast abundance of @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath19 will fall out of equilibrium during the evolution and finally decay .",
    "this decay can be cp - violating and therefore produce a net lepton number @xmath25    this lepton number later on will be converted to baryon number by non - perturbative processes .      in the context of gut scale right handed neutrinos",
    "it is very difficult to establish a one - to - one correspondence between high and low - energy observables . a given model , however , usually has generic predictions for low energy observables .",
    "therefore studying neutrinos allows to gain considerable insight into phenomena which otherwise would be inaccessible .",
    "colliders can not probe this kind of physics , since any effects in scattering amplitudes are suppressed by @xmath26 , at lhc this would be effects of @xmath27 ! in general any model of neutrino mass should provide predictions for the mixing pattern and the mass scale as well as whether neutrinos are majorana or dirac particles . in terms of flavor physics and the quest for a theory of flavor neutrinos provide one half of the available data .",

    "it is a true `` electronic bubble chamber '' with a much larger mass ( 3 ton for gargamelle , up to 100 kton now envisaged for lar tpcs ) .",
    "the `` state of the art '' is given by the 300 ton t300 icarus @xcite prototype module , tested at ground level in pavia but not yet used in an experiment .",

    "cryogenic insulation imposes a minimal surface / volume ratio .",
    "the modular icarus approach has thus to be abandoned for a single very large cryogenic module with about 1:1 aspect ratio .    to limit the number of readout channels , drift lengths have to be longer than the 1.5 m of the t300 module .",

    "gives an intrinsic limit to the readout granularity .",
    "the design of the single large cryostat @xcite can benefit from the techniques developed for transportation and storage of large quantities of liquefied natural gas , kept at boiling temperature by letting it evaporate .",
    "a large cryogenic plant is needed for the initial filling and for the continuous refilling to compensate the evaporation .    the r&d for the detector of ref .",
    "@xcite foresees : drift under 3 atm pressure as at the tank bottom ; charge extraction and amplification ; imaging devices ; cryogenics and cryostat design , in collaboration with industry ; a column - like prototype with 5 m drift and double - phase readout , with a 20 m drift simulated by a reduced e field and by a lower liquid argon purity ; test of a prototype in a magnetic field ( as for use in a @xmath28-factory ) ; underground safety issues .",

    "the use of emulsion cloud chamber ( ecc ) has been proposed to detect `` silver events '' from @xmath32 oscillations at a @xmath28-factory , in order to complement the @xmath33 `` golden events '' in resolving @xmath34 ambiguities @xcite .",

    "muons as those coming from @xmath35 decays , the scanning load is expected to be comparable with that in opera .",
    "an increase in the speed of the automatic microscopes is foreseeable .",
    "the opera collaboration is working to provide a milestone in the application of the ecc technique .",
    "the comparison of performances of different facilities can not be considered as concluded .",
    "several different aspects still need to be clarified before a final comparison can be performed .",
    "* costs , timescales , fluxes of the different accelerators systems are not yet fully worked out . * performances and optimization of the detectors",
    "are not known at the same level : for water erenkov detectors full simulation and full reconstructions of the events are available , based on the experience of super - kamiokande , but the optimization in terms of photo - detector coverage is still to be performed .",
    "the optimization of the magnetic detector ( and of the assumed cuts ) for the neutrino factory was performed for very small values of @xmath37 , and the performances are for the moment based on parametrization of the minos performances , and very low values of backgrounds from hadron decays ( pions , kaons , and charm ) are claimed possible .",
    "the performances of the emulsion detector for the silver channel of nufact or of the liquid argon detector are based on full simulations , but will need to be bench - marked using the performances of opera and icarus respectively .",
    "* several different measurements can be defined as significant for the facility , and they can not be optimized all together ( see also reference @xcite ) .",
    "for instance the following measurements bring to different optimizations : sensitivity to @xmath37 , discovery of subleading @xmath38   oscillations , unambiguous measurement of @xmath37 , measure of @xmath39 , discovery of leptonic cp violation , unambiguous measurement of @xmath40 . * the final extraction of the oscillation parameters can significantly change depending on technical aspects of the fitting programs ( like choice of the input parameters , treatment of the errors on the neutrino oscillation parameters , treatment of degeneracies etc . ) .",
    "+ the globes program @xcite represents a major improvement : it allows to compare different facilities keeping the same the fitting program , and it makes explicit the description of the performances of the detectors .",
    "we strongly recommend that new developments in this field will make use of globes , in view of a more transparent comparison of the different proposals .",
    "* systematic errors that strongly influence performances , for instance sensitivity to leptonic cp violation for large values of @xmath37 , are not substantially discussed in the literature .",
    "we are confident that facilities where neutrino fluxes can be known a - priori , as the case of beta beams and neutrino factories , will have smaller systematic errors ( and smaller backgrounds ) than e.g. neutrino superbeams .",
    "this difference is not known quantitatively today .",
    "+ the concept of the near detector station(s ) and flux monitoring systems has to be proposed together with the facility , in particular for low energy ( few 100 mev ) betabeam and superbeam where the issues of muon mass effect , fermi motion and binding energy uncertainty are highly non - trivial .",
    "+ finally , for the neutrino factory , the question of systematics on the prediction of matter effects is essential for the performance at large values of @xmath37 .",
    "* overall performances will depend on the combination of several different inputs .",
    "for instance low energy super beams and beta beams can profit of atmospheric neutrino oscillations , detected with a large statistics in the gigantic water erenkov detector , to solve degeneracies and measure @xmath41 , as shown in the @xcite .",
    "neutrino factory can profit of the combination of different channels as the golden and the silver one ( see section [ sec : nufact ] ) , detectors at different baselines , atmospheric neutrinos collected in the the iron magnetized detector @xcite .",
    "a full exploration of these possibilities is an ongoing process and the results available at today can not be considered final .",
    "having said that , a comparison of the facilities that at present are described in the globes library @xcite , as far as concerns and leptonic cp violation discovery potential , is shown in fig .  [ fig : final ] .",
    "the plots show the sensitivity to cp violation at 3@xmath42 cl ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "sensitivity to cp violation is defined , for a given point in the @xmath37-@xmath40  plane , by being able to exclude @xmath40=0 and @xmath44 at the given confidence level .",
    "all plots have been prepared with globes @xcite .",
    "degeneracies and correlations are fully taken into account .",
    "for all setups the appropriate disappearance channels have been included .",
    "the beta beam is lacking muon neutrino disappearance , but the result does not change if t2k disappearance information is included in the analysis . in all cases systematics between neutrinos , anti - neutrinos , appearance and disappearance is uncorrelated .",
    "for all setups with a water erenkov detector the systematics applies both to background and signal , uncorrelated .",
    "the neutrino factory assumes @xmath45 decays per year for 10 years and @xmath46 decays for 10 years .",
    "it has one detector with m=100 kton at 3000 km and another 30 kton detector at 7000 km .",
