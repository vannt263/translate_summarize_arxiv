    "tropical algebra ( also known as max - plus algebra ) is the linear algebra of the real numbers augmented with @xmath1 when equipped with the binary operations of addition and maximum .",
    "interest in this branch of mathematics is motivated by a wide range of applications in numerous subject areas including combinatorial optimisation and scheduling problems @xcite , analysis of discrete event systems @xcite , control theory @xcite , formal language and automata theory @xcite , phylogenetics @xcite , statistical inference @xcite , algebraic geometry @xcite and combinatorial / geometric group theory @xcite .",
    "tropical algebra and many of its basic properties have been independently rediscovered many times by researchers in these fields .",
    "the first detailed axiomatic study of  max - plus algebra \" was conducted by cuninghame - green @xcite and this theory has been developed further by a number of researchers ( see @xcite for surveys ) .",
    "many problems arising from application areas are naturally expressed as tropical matrix algebra problems , and much of the theory of tropical algebra is concerned with matrices .",
    "an important aspect is the algebraic structure of tropical matrices under multiplication ; many authors have proved a number of interesting _ ad hoc _ results ( see for example @xcite ) but so far there has been no systematic study in this area .",
    "this surprising omission is due largely to the difficulty , both conceptual and technical , of the subject .",
    "even the case of @xmath2 matrices , which is the main object of study in this paper , demonstrates a number of interesting phenomena .",
    "we believe that the development of a coherent and comprehensive theory of tropical matrix semigroups of arbitrary finite dimension is a major challenge .    the aim of this paper is to initiate the systematic study of the semigroup - theoretic structure of tropical matrices under multiplication , by considering the most natural starting point : the monoid of all @xmath0 tropical matrices .",
    "we give a complete geometric description of green s relations in this semigroup , from which we are also able to deduce that the semigroup is regular , and to describe all of its maximal subgroups .",
    "since conducting this research , we have learned that an independent study of some of these topics has recently been conducted by izhakian and margolis @xcite .",
    "in addition to this introduction , this paper comprises three sections . in section  [ sec_prelim ]",
    "we give a brief expository introduction to the tropical semiring and tropical matrix algebra , including a summary of known results about tropical matrix semigroups .",
    "section  [ sec_green ] is devoted to an examination of the ideal structure of the monoid of all @xmath0 tropical matrices , obtaining in particular geometric descriptions of green s relations @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and of the associated partial orders .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec_idpt ] we consider the idempotent elements of this monoid ; combined with the results of the previous section , this allows us to prove that the monoid is _ regular _ , and to describe completely its maximal subgroups .",

    "it follows easily that the group of units in @xmath39 is isomorphic to the permutation wreath product @xmath40 of the additive group of real numbers with the symmetric group on @xmath22 points .",

    "vector addition in @xmath50 may also be described pictorially as follows .",
