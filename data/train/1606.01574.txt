    "microscopic devices capable of extracting work from thermal fluctuations have attracted considerable interest since origins of statistical mechanics .",
    "perhaps the best known of these maxwell demons @xcite is the ratchet model due to smoluchowski @xcite and feynman @xcite .",
    "the model consists of 1 ) a wheel with asymmetric teeth ( see fig .",
    "@xmath0  in ref .",
    "@xcite , or fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] below ) , randomly rotating due to perpetual bombardment by molecules of a surrounding fluid ; and 2 ) a pawl which is aimed to rectify the rotatory brownian motion of the wheel .",
    "apparently , such a device is capable to transform erratic thermal fluctuations into systematic motion with the potential to perform work on an external load attached to the wheel , and indeed , when the wheel and the pawl are coupled to heat reservoirs _ at different temperatures _ , the wheel starts to rotate in one direction @xcite .    though originally introduced by feynman as a pedagogical tool , the two - temperature ratchet has gained significant attention in recent years .",
    "the model belongs to the class of non - equilibrium steady - state stochastic heat engines and it is interesting from both the dynamic @xcite and the thermodynamic @xcite points of view . since the original feynman s mechanical setting is too complex to be analyzed from the first principles ( see , however ,  @xcite ) , several _ qualitatively similar _",
    "stochastic models emerged @xcite .",
    "a couple of them are exactly solvable @xcite , other were analyzed numerically @xcite .",
    "the models were studied regarding their reversibility @xcite and from a general point of view of symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "fluctuation theorems for such models were derived in refs .",
    "@xcite and in refs .",
    "@xcite general results regarding steady state were derived in the linear - response regime .",
    "experimentally , stochastic heat flow in a two - temperature microscopic system was studied with optical tweezers @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we propose and solve a two - dimensional brownian model of the feynman s ratchet ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the model is based on the brownian motion in the confining asymmetric channel subjected to thermal noises with different intensities ( temperatures ) along the transversal and longitudinal directions .",
    "the model is solved by a generalization of the so - called fick - jacobs approximation @xcite .",
    "the presented expansion allows us to derive principal characteristics of the ratchet  the stationary pdf in the unit cell of the potential , the mean velocity of the particle , and the effective diffusion coefficient as the functions of the two temperatures .",
    "the discussed model offers a rare possibility to study analytically a rather non - trivial physics of a two - dimensional far - from - equilibrium stochastic system . at the same time it provides further physical insight into the fick - jacobs theory .",
    "the latter was originally developed to characterize impact of entropic forces on diffusion in narrow corrugated channels @xcite and during recent years it has become a subject of an intensive testing and extensions @xcite .",
    "various brownian ratchets have already been studied with the aid of the fick - jacobs approximation including flashing and rocking ratchets @xcite and ratchets driven by a temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "actual applications of the ratchet effect in corrugated channels for separation of particles according to their sizes was investigated both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we develop a perturbation expansion , which generalizes the fick - jacobs theory to the case of diffusion in the corrugated channel with soft walls ( i.e. , the particle is confined by the potential instead of the hard walls which are commonly considered in the literature ) driven out of equilibrium by two thermal baths . in the previously studied models ,",
    "the behavior of the mean particle velocity was always captured by the lowest order approximation , i.e. , by the standard fick - jacobs theory . in our case ,",
    "the fact that the particle transport is driven solely by temperatures of the two heat reservoirs , introduces substantial complications .",
    "the ratchet effect is absent in the lowest - order approximation ( mean particle velocity is zero ) and it appears only in higher - order terms .",
