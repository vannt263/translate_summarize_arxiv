    "we find that @xmath82 , which in physical units corresponds to @xmath83 at first sight , these seem to be easier to reconcile with the envisioned fast isotropization .",
    "however , even though secondaries can reach much higher growth rates their appearance can be delayed . according to the results in fig .",
    "[ a - vs - t ] the secondaries only affect the isotropization process at early times if the initial conditions happen to be similar to the gauge field configuration at @xmath84 because otherwise they would set in too late .",

    "the above results show that ( secondary ) growth rates can , however , increase with decreasing @xmath87 .",
    "their understanding requires to go beyond hard loop approximations , which is done in the following .",
    "we have seen above that low momentum modes of @xmath88 show an exponential increase starting at the very beginning of the simulation , while for sufficiently large initial anisotropy higher momentum modes exhibit exponential growth at a secondary stage with rates several times larger than primary ones . following the discussion of qualitatively similar findings in refs .",

    "accordingly , their contribution to the time evolution of the correlator may be neglected and primary growth rates appear as a consequence of weibel instabilities as discussed in great detail in the literature  @xcite .",

    "the faster growth is seen to stop at about @xmath102 .",
    "this is precisely the time where the secondary growth rate for the correlator sets in .",

    "[ sketch_diagrams ] . for the case of the scalar preheating dynamics analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that secondary growth rates indeed equal multiples of primary ones .",
    "this was possible because primary growth was sharply peaked around certain momenta in the scalar models at weak coupling , and the loop integrals could be estimated in a saddle point approximation around the dominating loop - momentum . for the su(2 )",
    "gauge theory considered here primaries do not appear in a sharply peaked momentum range as can be observed from fig .",

    "in section [ sec : growth - rates ] we have seen that for large anisotropies , corresponding to @xmath47-like initial distributions ( [ initcond-1 ] ) , sizeable secondaries only appear at later times and not from the beginning of the simulation .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that for these initial conditions the loop corrections as in fig .",
    "[ sketch_diagrams ] are negligible at initial time for longitudinal momenta . in contrast , broadening of the initial distribution in the longitudinal direction can lead to sizeable initial loop corrections .",

    "the figures to the right show the same quantities at later times . the longitudinal wilson loop is seen to develop an area law and at the time @xmath135 , after the exponential growth of gauge field fluctuations saturates ,",
    "all wilson loops follow the same area law and the anisotropy is removed with @xmath136 .",
    "we conclude that the isotropization of the spatial wilson loops occurs on a similar characteristic time scale as the low - momentum coarse - grained pressure .",
    "though the string tension extracted from the transversal wilson loops is non - vanishing from the beginning , it changes with time . in fig.[fig - stringtension ]",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath137 is plotted as a function of time in units of the energy density @xmath8 . for the considered initial conditions one observes",
    "an initial decrease with time , which tends to a non - zero value @xmath138 at late times .",
    "we verify the expectation that quantities such as pressure are not sensitive to this scale .",

    "( [ wloop ] ) for spatial wilson loops may seem surprising in a classical - statistical theory at first sight . however , our nonequilibrium results relate well to known behavior in thermal equilibrium at high temperature . the low - momentum behavior of a @xmath139-dimensional bosonic quantum theory at sufficiently high - temperature is described in terms of a @xmath140-dimensional classical - statistical theory by virtue of dimensional reduction , and the @xmath140-dimensional non - abelian gauge theory is known to exhibit an area law in thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "our results may be viewed as nonequilibrium generalization of this .",
    "real - time lattice qcd is a crucial tool for the quantitative understanding of the nonperturbative thermalization processes in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "late - time dynamics requires calculation of nonequilibrium dynamics in the full quantum theory , which is still a formidable task .",
    "important aspects of the short - time dynamics in the presence of high gluon occupation numbers , however , may be calculated using the classical - statistical field theory limit without further approximations . in particular , for a large class of initial conditions there is no need to model high momentum degrees of freedom as particles or to restrict the discussion to the very weak coupling limit . in this work",
    "we have considered classical - statistical su(2 ) gauge theory for anisotropic initial conditions with high occupation numbers in the transverse plane on a characteristic scale @xmath141 .",
    "we observe weibel or primary instabilities with growth rates similar to those obtained from previous treatments using a variety of setups and approximations  @xcite .",
    "we observe secondary growth rates for higher - momentum modes reaching substantially larger values .",
    "the secondaries are fluctuation induced and reflect strongly non - linear dynamics .",
    "two types of gauge invariant observables have been calculated : firstly the time evolution of the spatial part of the energy momentum tensor , which is related to pressure .",
    "its fourier transform may be considered as a scale dependent pressure with a characteristic coarse - graining momentum scale .",
    "we observe that plasma instabilities lead to a rapid `` bottom - up '' isotropization up to momenta of about @xmath4gev for an energy energy density of @xmath142 .",
    "the characteristic time scale is given by the inverse growth rate of about @xmath143fm / c .",
    "complete isotropization does not occur on short time scales . therefore it is important to note that an effectively isotropic pressure for a low - momentum range of characteristic momenta is a crucial ingredient for the use of hydrodynamics , and complete isotropization may not be necessary to account for its successful applications to describe rhic data .    the pressure is a quantity which is not sensitive to long - ranged fluctuations in contrast to the second type of observables we compute : the nonequilibrium spatial wilson loop is shown to become isotropic on similar characteristic time scales as the coarse grained pressure for low momenta . at this time",
    "all large spatial wilson loops are found to obey an area law , which is used to compute a non - vanishing scale with the dimension of a string tension .",
    "the generation of a non - vanishing scale demonstrates the non - perturbative nature of the classical - statistical limit of the corresponding quantum theory .",
    "we have verified that the pressure and growth rates are insensitive to this scale , which is required for weak - coupling descriptions of these quantities .",
    "the extension to su(3 ) pure gauge theory is straightforward , though computationally more expensive , in order to verify that the changes are indeed minor as expected .",
    "since fermions can not have large occupation numbers , their contributions to the low - momentum dynamics is expected to be small and the results should give a quantitative account of the short - time physics .",
    "+ we thank adrian dumitru , carsten greiner , mike strickland and zhe xu for very interesting discussions , and mike for re - calculating some of the results presented here using his setup .",
    "this work is supported in part by the bmbf grant 06da267 , and by the dfg under contract sfb634 .",
    "in this appendix we demonstrate the insensitivity of our results under variations of volume or spatial lattice distance .",
    "all simulations were done with @xmath144 and the initial configurations were generated from the momentum space probability distribution eq .   using the same values for the widths and fixing the normalization such that the energy densities agree .",

    "volume dependences can hardly be observed for lattices of size 64@xmath148 or larger and also on the smallest lattice ( 32@xmath148 ) only minor deviations occur .",
    "since the uv part of the spectrum is not excited in the beginning , the dependence on the uv cutoff or , equivalently , the lattice spacing should be even milder than the volume dependence . in fig .",
