    "during the last years quantum information @xcite has become one of the new hot topic field in physics , with the potential to revolutionize many areas of science and technology .",
    "quantum information replaces the laws of classical physics , applied to computation and communication , with the more fundamental laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "this becomes increasingly important due to technological progress reaching smaller and smaller scales . extrapolating the miniaturization process of integrated circuits",
    "one would estimate that we shall reach the atomic size for storing a single bit of information around the year 2020 ( at the present time the typical size of circuit components is of the order of 100 nanometers ) . at that point",
    ", quantum effects will become unavoidably dominant .",
    "the final aim of quantum computation is to build a machine based on quantum logic , that is , a machine that can process the information and perform logic operations in agreement with the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "in addition to its fundamental interest , a large scale quantum computer , if constructed , would advance computing power beyond the capabilities of classical computation .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to illustrate the main features of a quantum computer in the concrete example of a quantum simulator of the single - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "we wish to show that quantum logic , already with a small number of qubits , allows the efficient simulation of basic quantum mechanical problems .",
    "a quantum simulator with @xmath0 qubits could produce a real picture book of quantum mechanics .",
    "we believe that snapshots from this book will help develop a physical intuition of the power of quantum computation .",
    "our paper adds to other existing pedagogical presentations of various apects of quantum computation , including shor s quantum algorithm for integer factorization @xcite , grover s quantum search algorithm @xcite , quantum information processing by means of nuclear magnetic resonance techniques @xcite , using linear optics @xcite , with cold atoms and ions @xcite , or with superconducting circuits @xcite , quantum measurements @xcite , decoherence @xcite , quantum error - correction and fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the elementary unit of quantum information is the _ qubit _ ( the quantum counterpart of the classical bit ) and a quantum computer may be viewed as a many - qubit system .",
    "physically , a qubit is a two - level system , like the two spin states of a spin-@xmath1 particle , the polarization states of a single photon or two states of an atom .",
    "a classical bit is a system that can exist in two distinct states , which are used to represent @xmath2 and @xmath3 , that is , a single binary digit .",
    "the only possible operations ( classical gates ) in such a system are the identity ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and not ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "in contrast , a quantum bit ( qubit ) is a two - level quantum system , described by a two - dimensional complex hilbert space . in this space",
    ", one may choose a pair of normalized and mutually orthogonal quantum states , called @xmath8 and @xmath9 , to represent the values @xmath2 and @xmath3 of a classical bit .",
    "these two states form a computational basis . from the _ superposition principle _ , any state of the qubit may be written as @xmath10 where the amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 are complex numbers , constrained by the normalization condition @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , state vectors are defined up to a global phase of no physical significance .",
    "therefore , @xmath14 only depends on two real parameters and we may write @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    a collection of @xmath18 qubits is known as a _ quantum register _ of size @xmath18 .",
    "its wave function resides in a @xmath19-dimensional complex hilbert space .",
    "while the state of an @xmath18-bit classical computer is described in binary notation by an integer @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 binary digits , the state of an @xmath18-qubit quantum computer is @xmath23 where @xmath24-th qubit , and @xmath25 . note that we use the shorthand notation @xmath26 for the tensor product @xmath27 . taking into account the normalization condition and the fact that a quantum state is only defined up to an overall phase ,",
    "the state of an @xmath18-qubit quantum computer is determined by @xmath28 independent real parameters .",
    "the superposition principle is clearly visible in eq .",
    "( [ superposition ] ) : while @xmath18 classical bits can store only a single integer @xmath29 , the @xmath18-qubit quantum register can be prepared in the corresponding state @xmath30 of the computational basis , but also in a superposition . we stress that the number of states of the computational basis in this superposition can be as large as @xmath19 , which grows exponentially with the number of qubits .",
    "the superposition principle opens up new possibilities for efficient computation .",
    "when we perform a computation on a classical computer , different inputs require separate runs .",
    "in contrast , a quantum computer can perform a computation for exponentially many inputs on a single run .",
    "this huge parallelism is the basis of the power of quantum computation .",
    "we stress that the superposition principle is not a uniquely quantum feature . indeed",
    ", classical waves satisfying the superposition principle do exist .",
    "for instance , we may consider the wave equation for a vibrating string with fixed endpoints .",
    "it is therefore also important to point out the role of _ entanglement _ for the power of quantum computation , as compared to any classical computation .",
    "entanglement is arguably the most spectacular and counter - intuitive manifestation of quantum mechanics , observed in composite quantum systems : it signifies the existence of non - local correlations between measurements performed on particles who interacted in the past but now are located arbitrarily far away .",
    "mathematically , we say that a two - particle state @xmath14 is entangled , or non - separable , if it can not be written as a simple product @xmath31 of two states describing the first and the second subsystem , respectively , but only as a superposition of such states : @xmath32 .",
    "for instance , the ( bell ) state @xmath33 is entangled , while the state @xmath34 is separable ( _ i.e. _ , not entangled ) , since we can write it in the form @xmath35 .",
    "there is no entanglement in classical physics .",
    "therefore , in order to represent the superposition of @xmath19 levels by means of classical waves , these levels must belong to the same system .",
    "indeed , classical states of separate systems can never be superposed .",
    "the overall state space of a composite classical system is the cartesian product of the individual state spaces of the subsystems , while in quantum mechanics it is the tensor product .",
    "thus , to represent the generic @xmath18-qubit state of ( [ superposition ] ) by classical waves we need a single system with @xmath19 levels . if @xmath36 is the typical energy separation between two consecutive levels , the amount of energy required for this computation is given by @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the amount of physical resources needed for the computation grows exponentially with @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , due to entanglement , in quantum physics a general superposition of @xmath19 levels may be represented by means of @xmath18 qubits .",
    "thus , the amount of physical resources ( energy ) grows only linearly with @xmath18 .    to implement a quantum computation",
    ", we must be able to control the evolution in time of the many - qubit state describing the quantum computer .",
    "as far as the coupling to the environment may be neglected , this evolution is unitary and governed by the schrdinger equation .",
    "it is well known that a small set of elementary logic gates allows the implementation of any complex computation on a classical computer .",
    "this is very important : it means that , when we change the problem , we do not need to modify our computer hardware .",
    "fortunately , the same property remains valid for a quantum computer .",
    "it turns out that , in the quantum circuit model , each unitary transformation acting on a many - qubit system can be decomposed into ( unitary ) quantum gates acting on a single qubit and a suitable ( unitary ) quantum gate acting on two qubits . any unitary operation on a single qubit can be constructed using only hadamard and phase - shift gates .",
    "the hadamard gate is defined as follows : it turns @xmath8 into @xmath38 and @xmath9 into @xmath39 .",
    "the phase - shift gate ( of phase @xmath40 ) turns @xmath8 into @xmath8 and @xmath9 into @xmath41 . since global phases",
    "have no physical meaning , the states of the computational basis , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are unchanged . however , a generic single - qubit state @xmath42 is mapped into @xmath43 . since relative phases are observable",
    ", the state of the qubit has been changed by the application of the phase - shift gate .",
    "we can decompose a generic unitary transformation acting on a many - qubit state into a sequence of hadamard , phase - shift and controlled - not ( cnot ) gates , where cnot is a two - qubit gate , defined as follows : it turns @xmath44 into @xmath44 , @xmath45 into @xmath45 , @xmath46 into @xmath47 and @xmath47 into @xmath46 . as in the classical xor gate",
    ", the cnot gate flips the state of the second ( target ) qubit if the first ( control ) qubit is in the state @xmath9 and does nothing if the first qubit is in the state @xmath8 . of course , the cnot gate , in contrast to the classical xor gate ,",
    "can also be applied to any superposition of the computational basis states .",
    "the decomposition of a generic unitary transformation of an @xmath18-qubit system into elementary quantum gates is in general inefficient , that is , it requires a number of gates exponentially large in @xmath18 ( more precisely , @xmath48 quantum gates ) . however , there are unitary transformations that can be computed efficiently in the quantum circuit model , namely by means of a number of elementary gates polynomial in @xmath18 .",
    "this is the case in many computational problems of interest .",
    "a very important example is given by the quantum fourier transform , mapping a generic @xmath18-qubit state @xmath49 into @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and the vector @xmath52 is the discrete fourier transform of the vector @xmath53 , that is , @xmath54 . it can be shown that this transformation can be efficiently implemented in @xmath55 elementary quantum gates , whereas the best known classical algorithm to simulate the fourier transform , the fast fourier transform , requires @xmath56 elementary operations .",
    "a quantum circuit computing the quantum fourier transform is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : qft ] : it requires @xmath18 hadamard and @xmath57 controlled phase - shift gates . by definition , the controlled phase - shift gate cphase@xmath58 applies a phase shift @xmath40 to the target qubit only when the control qubit is in the state @xmath9 : it turns @xmath44 into @xmath44 , @xmath45 into @xmath45 , @xmath46 into @xmath46 and @xmath47 into @xmath59 .",
    "the quantum fourier transform is an essential subroutine in many quantum algorithms , including the quantum simulator described in this paper .",
    "as we have seen , the power of quantum computation is due to the inherent _ quantum parallelism _ associated with the superposition principle . in simple terms , a quantum computer can process a large number of classical inputs in a single run .",
    "for instance , starting from the input state @xmath60 , we may obtain the output state @xmath61 therefore , we have computed the function @xmath62 for all @xmath29 in a single run .",
    "note that a quantum computer implements reversible unitary transformations and that we need two quantum registers in ( [ fsuperposition ] ) to compute in a reversible way a generic function @xmath63 .",
    "we emphasize that it is not an easy task to extract useful information from the output state .",
    "the problem is that this information is , in a sense , hidden .",
    "any quantum computation ends up with a projective measurement in the computational basis : we measure the qubit polarization ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) for all the qubits .",
    "the output of the measurement process is inherently probabilistic and the probabilities of the different possible outputs are set by the basic postulates of quantum mechanics .",
    "given the state ( [ fsuperposition ] ) , we obtain outcome @xmath64 with probability @xmath65 .",
    "hence , we end up with the evaluation of the function @xmath62 for a single @xmath66 , exactly as with a classical computer .",
    "nevertheless , there exist quantum algorithms that exploit _ quantum interference _ to efficiently extract useful information .",
    "note that in principle one could consider more general , non projective measurements .",
    "however , this would not modify considerations on the efficiency of a given quantum algorithm .",
    "the reason is that generalized mesurements , after the addition of ancillary qubits , can always be represented by unitary transformations followed by standard projective measurements @xcite .    in 1994",
    ", shor discovered a quantum algorithm which factorizes large integers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm .",
    "it was also shown by grover that the search of an item in an unstructured database can be done with a square root speed up over any classical algorithm .",
    "a third relevant class of quantum algorithms is the simulation of physical systems . in particular , the power of a quantum computer is intuitive for quantum many - body problems .",
    "it is indeed well known that the simulation of such problems on a classical computer is a difficult task as the size of the hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of particles .",
    "for instance , if we wish to simulate a chain of @xmath18 spin-@xmath1 particles , the size of the hilbert space is @xmath19 .",
    "namely , the state of this system is determined by @xmath19 complex numbers . as observed by feynman in the 1980 s , the growth in memory requirement",
    "is only linear on a quantum computer , which is itself a many - body quantum system .",
    "for example , to simulate @xmath18 spin-@xmath1 particles we only need @xmath18 qubits .",
    "therefore , a quantum computer operating with only a few tens of qubits can outperform a classical computer .",
    "of course , this is only true if we can find efficient quantum algorithms to extract useful information from the quantum computer . quite interestingly",
    ", it has been shown that a quantum computer can be useful not only for the investigation of the properties of many - body quantum systems , but also for the study of the quantum and classical dynamics of complex single - particle systems .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , basic quantum mechanical problems already can be simulated with @xmath0 qubits , while about @xmath67 qubits would allow one to make computations inaccessible to today s supercomputers .",
    "we note that this figure has to be compared with the more than @xmath68 qubits required to the shor s algorithm to outperform classical computations .",
    "moreover , these estimates neglect the computational overhead needed to correct errors and error - correction becomes necessary to obtain reliable results by means of a large - scale quantum computer .",
    "to illustrate the working of a quantum algorithm by means of a concrete example , let us consider the quantum - mechanical motion of a particle in one dimension ( the extension to higher dimensions is straightforward ) @xcite .",
    "it is governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath69 where the hamiltonian @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 the hamiltonian @xmath72 governs the free motion of the particle , while @xmath73 is a one - dimensional potential . to solve eq .",
    "( [ 1dsch ] ) on a quantum computer with finite resources ( a finite number of qubits and a finite sequence of quantum gates ) , we must first of all discretize the continuous variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "if the motion essentially takes place inside a finite region , say @xmath76 , we decompose this region into @xmath19 intervals of length @xmath77 and represent these intervals by means of the hilbert space of an @xmath18-qubit quantum register ( this means that the discretization step drops exponentially with the number of qubits ) .",
    "hence , the wave function @xmath78 is approximated by @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xmath81 is a state of the computational basis of the @xmath18-qubit quantum register and @xmath82 is a factor that ensures correct normalization of the wave function .",
    "it is intuitive that ( [ psidiscretized ] ) provides a good approximation to @xmath14 when the discretization step @xmath36 is much smaller than the shortest length scale relevant for the description of the system .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( [ 1dsch ] ) may be integrated formally by propagating the initial wave function @xmath83 for each time - step @xmath84 as follows : @xmath85 \\epsilon } \\ , \\psi(x , t ) \\,.\\ ] ] if the time - step @xmath84 is small enough ( that is , much smaller than the time scales of interest for the dynamics of the system ) , it is possible to write @xmath86 \\",

    "the operator on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ trotter ] ) is still unitary and simpler than that on the left - hand side .",
    "we can now take advantage of the fact that the fourier transform can be efficiently performed by a quantum computer .",
    "we call @xmath90 the momentum variable conjugate to @xmath74 , that is , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the fourier transform . therefore ,",
    "we can write the first operator in the right - hand side of ( [ trotter ] ) as @xmath93 in this expression , we pass , by means of the fourier transform @xmath92 , from the @xmath74-representation to the @xmath90-representation , in which this operator is diagonal . then , using the inverse fourier transform @xmath94 , we return to the @xmath74-representation , in which the operator @xmath95 is diagonal .",
    "the wave function @xmath78 at time @xmath96 is obtained ( up to errors @xmath97 ) from the initial wave function @xmath83 by applying @xmath98 times the unitary operator @xmath99    therefore , simulation of the schrdinger equation is now reduced to the implementation of the fourier transform plus diagonal operators of the form @xmath100 note that an operator of the form ( [ eifx ] ) appears both in the computation of @xmath95 and of @xmath101 , when this latter operator is written in the @xmath90-representation .",
    "any operator of the form ( [ eifx ] ) can be implemented by means of @xmath102 generalized controlled - phase shift gates , which apply the transformation @xmath103 to the target qubit only when the @xmath104 ( control ) qubits are in the state @xmath30 . here",

    "note that the implementation described in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagonalu ] is inefficient , as it scales exponentially with the number of qubits . on the other hand , efficient ( that its , polynomial in @xmath18 ) implementations are possible for most of the cases of physical interest .",

    "using eqs .",

    "this is the product of @xmath117 phase - shift gates , each acting non - trivially ( differently from identity ) only on the qubits @xmath125 and @xmath98 . since the kinetic energy @xmath88 is proportional to @xmath126 , an analogous decomposition is readily obtained , in the momentum eigenbasis , for @xmath101 .",
    "efficient implementations are possible for piecewise analytic potentials @xmath73 but require , in general , the use of ancillary qubits .",
