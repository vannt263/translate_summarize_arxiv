    "networks of the real world often seem to combine aspects from regular and from completely random lattices .",
    "social networks , neural networks , electrical powergrids , and traffic networks @xcite are all examples of patterns not described satisfactorly by conventional regular lattices , nor by completely random lattices .",
    "social structures , for instance , do not behave as regular lattices , since ( as is well known ) randomly chosen people are connected in general by a small number of intermediary bilateral ties . here , as in random graphs , the minimal ( chemical ) distance between any two points in the system scales logarithmically with the system size @xcite .",
    "to combine these two properties , watts and strogatz recently introduced the idea of _ small - world networks _",
    "this construction is a superposition of a regular lattice with a random lattice , and includes simultaneously well defined local clusters and short global connections .",
    "as we will demonstrate , these systems also display properties intermediate between those of regular and tree - like ( loop - less ) lattices , already under a small number of global connections , provided the system size is large enough .",
    "much work has already been done on the properties of small - world networks @xcite but most of it has focused on static ( geometric ) properties .",
    "we shall not address these issues , but rather concentrate on a _ dynamical _ model defined on the structure .",
    "treatments of the dynamics of small - world networks include for instance the study of an ising model defined on the lattice @xcite , spectral properties of the small - world laplacian , @xcite , percolation @xcite , spreading of diseases @xcite and neural networks @xcite . in the following",
    "we will examine the properties of random walks on small - world networks , in particular the relaxation , exemplified by the probability for a random walker of being at the original site at a later time .",
    "this is a simple quantity to extract numerically , and very relevant for various physical properties : it is sensitive to the topology of the network , and is related to its vibrational modes .",
    "the small - world networks we consider are built as follows : we start from a regular lattice with @xmath0 vertices in @xmath1 dimension under periodic boundary conditions , each site being connected symmetrically to its @xmath2 nearest neighbours , i.e. having as coordination number @xmath3 .",
    "then we add to each of the sites with probability @xmath4 a new bond .",
    "the other end gets attached with equal probability to any of the lattice sites ; this allows also the possibility of vertices to become connected to themselves . in this way we add , independent of @xmath5 , on the average @xmath6 new bonds to the underlying regular lattice .",
    "this construction follows @xcite for @xmath7 and is simpler than the original procedure @xcite , by which one rewires with probability @xmath4 each of the original @xmath8 bonds randomly .",
    "a step - wise diffusion process is now defined by specifying all the transition probabilities @xmath9 entering the master - equation : @xmath10    the @xmath11 is the probability to go from site @xmath12 to site @xmath13 during one time step , and the probability @xmath14 , @xmath15 is just the probability of being at site @xmath12 after the @xmath16th step . the process defined in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) is the discrete variant of diffusion on an arbitrary lattice , a topic interesting in its own right .",
    "diffusion on regular lattices is ubiquitous , and diffusion on random graphs has ( among other things ) also been studied in the context of glassy relaxation @xcite .",
    "we are therefore inspired to investigate what happens on the small - world model , which interpolates between these two extremes .",
    "previously a lot of interest has also been seen in the related problem of diffusion on fractals ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . as we proceed to show , diffusion on cayley trees @xcite shows",
    "also features closely related to the present problem .",
    "furthermore , the motion of charge carriers or of excitons over polymer chains , where steps between spatially close sites can connect regions far apart along the chemical backbone , also involves global shortcuts @xcite .",
    "the transition probabilities @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) are as follows : first @xmath17 if there are no bonds between @xmath12 and @xmath18 . for @xmath12 connected to @xmath18 by one or more direct bonds , @xmath9 is proportional to the number of such bonds .",
    "the same holds for the probability of remaining at the same site after one time unit , i.e. we allow `` sticking '' .",
    "formally    @xmath19    in this equation , @xmath20 is the number of bonds between the two sites @xmath12 and @xmath18 , and @xmath21 is the total number of bonds emanating from vertex @xmath12 , i.e. the coordination number of the site .",
    "hence @xmath22 .",
    "note that the @xmath20-values are determined both by the additional wiring as well as by the underlying lattice .",
    "the @xmath23 and the @xmath1 in the denominator appear because we allow for the possibility of the walker to remain at site @xmath12 during a time step .",
    "this procedure renders the numerically determined @xmath14 smoother in @xmath16 .",
    "we remark that the rates defined according to eq .",
    "( [ transprob ] ) are not symmetrical in @xmath12 and @xmath18 , i.e. in general @xmath24 .    the algorithm we have used is the exact ( cellular automaton ) enumeration of random walks @xcite , corresponding to the implementation of eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) .",
    "all the results plotted are averaged over @xmath25 disorder configurations .",
    "we have worked mostly with the value @xmath7 .",
    "this is also the value implied if we do not state otherwise .",
    "we focus on the probability @xmath26 that a particle initially at site @xmath12 is found at the same site just after the @xmath16th step . in the figures below we plot @xmath27 ,",
    "i.e. the average of @xmath26 over the different realisations of the small - world lattice .",
    "since all sites are equivalent in an ensemble of small - world networks , this quantity does not depend the particular site @xmath12 chosen , and we hereafter denote it by @xmath28 . in fig .",
    "[ varylp1 ] we have chosen @xmath29 and plotted @xmath28 in double - logarithmic scales for system sizes ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "this allows us to examine the dependence of @xmath28 on the size of the system .",
    "( 6,5.8 ) ( -2.2,6.6 )    from fig .",
    "[ varylp1 ] we infer that initially all the curves fall on one curve and that for large @xmath16 they saturate at their respective equilibrium values , @xmath32 .",
    "however , eq . ( [ transprob ] ) implies an inhomogenous equilibrium distribution    @xmath33    therefore @xmath34 depends on the specific small - world realisation , and will fluctuate from realisation to realisation around its average value @xmath32 .    to find out how much of the behavior is due to finite size effects , we subtract from each average curve in fig .",
    "[ varylp1 ] its corresponding average equilibrium value @xmath35 , and replot @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ pvarylp1 ] .",
    "( 6,5.8 ) ( -2.2,6.6 )    from fig .",
    "[ pvarylp1 ] we see that all curves collapse nicely onto what we view as representing @xmath28 on small - world networks in the limit @xmath37 . both figs .",
    "[ varylp1 ] and [ pvarylp1 ] display initially a quasi - linear decay in the chosen double logarithmic scales , and this may be viewed as being an approximate power law decay .",
    "depending on @xmath4 , the exponents range from around @xmath38 for the smallest @xmath4 to around @xmath39 for the largest .",
    "this regime is followed by a steeper decay at larger @xmath16 . to highlight the power law character we have plotted in fig.[apppow ] @xmath28 for @xmath40 .",
    "as is evident from the figure , the power - law domain extends well over two orders of magnitude in @xmath16 .",
    "( 6,5.8 ) ( -2.2,6.6 )    the results can be understood qualitatively in the following way : for a fractal one has @xcite",
    "@xmath41    where @xmath42 is the spectral dimension .",
    "thus the initial decay in figs .",
    "[ varylp1 ] to [ apppow ] follows that of a fractal with a @xmath42 close to @xmath1 , i.e. that of a quasi @xmath1-d system .",
    "this is reasonable given our construction : for sufficiently small @xmath4 and small @xmath16 , only relatively few random walkers encounter any long - range connections ( shortcuts ) . therefore in the beginning the behavior of @xmath28",
    "closely reflects the character of the underlying @xmath1-d lattice .",
    "however for larger @xmath16 , the random walkers probe larger and larger portions of the graph , and thus follow more and more shortcuts .",
    "this speeds up progressively the decay of @xmath28 as more regions at larger and larger length scales are visited , and the fractal picture is lost .",
    "one would thus expect that the concept of a @xmath42 begins to be invalid when the random walkers visit enough short cuts , i.e. when the @xmath1-d diffusion extends longer than the typical distance between shortcuts .",
    "this is the fundamental length scale @xmath43 of small - world networks , besides the lattice constant , which is less important here . in our case",
    "we have @xmath44 measuring @xmath43 in units of the lattice constant .",
    "for diffusion on scales smaller than @xmath43 one furthermore has in terms of the diffusion constant @xmath45 of the regular lattice @xmath46 , so that    @xmath47    given that we allow random walkers to stay at a site during a time step , @xmath48 and thus @xmath49 .",
    "however some walkers do encounter shortcuts at length - scales below @xmath50 , and numerically the cross - over to a region that does not have approximate power - law character is seen to take place earlier than @xmath51 .",
    "we turn now to the analysis of this region . to be able to follow the it more closely , we replot the results of fig .",
    "[ pvarylp1 ] for @xmath31 on semi - logarithmic scales in fig .",
    "[ semilogp1 ] . evidently , the decay for larger @xmath16 is slower than exponential .",
    "( 6,5.8 ) ( -2.2,6.6 )    the decay of @xmath28 is hence quicker than a power - law , but slower than the one for cayley - trees , for which one has ( for coordination numbers greater than @xmath52 ) @xcite    @xmath53,\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is a constant . comparing this behavior to the one displayed in figs .",
    "[ varylp1 ] and [ semilogp1 ] we remark that in our case , for a relatively small number of steps , the decay goes approximately as @xmath55 with @xmath56 , whereas at larger @xmath16 , a more adequate description would be a stretched exponential , @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "one may even suspect that the decay in fig .",
    "[ semilogp1 ] obeys @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "a fit of the data in fig .",
    "[ semilogp1 ] to this functional form ( keeping @xmath59 fixed ) is also shown ; the fit turns out to be indistinguishable from the numerical data , when we choose @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ semilogp1 ] .",
    "we now consider the dependence of the decay on the value of @xmath4 .",
    "for this we plot in fig .",
    "[ varyp ] the decay law @xmath28 for @xmath62 and @xmath4 ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath63 .",
    "( 6,5.8 ) ( -2.2,6.6 )    we note that the initial power - law like region diminishes with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the plateau - region @xmath64 is reached earlier for larger @xmath4 .",
    "this is in accordance with our argument above , that the long - range connections ( short - cuts ) interrupt the simple diffusion on the underlying lattice , such that the crossover length decreases with increasing @xmath4 ( c.f . also eq .",
    "( [ timescale ] ) ) .",
    "as @xmath4 becomes large enough , the power law regime practically disappears .",
    "this is so because the random walker rapidly meets a short - cut .",
    "as before , the influence of finite size effects can be reduced by plotting , as in fig .",
    "[ pvarylp1 ] , @xmath36 .",
    "we have also performed simulations of the random walk on small - world networks where the underlying lattice has a @xmath5 value larger than @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ varyk ] we plot the results for @xmath65 and @xmath62 in the cases of @xmath7 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the findings reproduce the general picture : @xmath28 behaves like a power law for small @xmath16 , while decaying more rapidly as @xmath16 gets larger .",
    "the curves for different @xmath5 are mainly shifted with respect to each other , and the network with the largest coordination number ( largest @xmath5 ) also displays the quickest relaxation . to be noted , however",
    ", is that the case @xmath7 has the largest dynamical range and thus shows best the decay forms , while also being the one simplest to implement ; hence @xmath7 may be the ideal small - world model .",
    "( 6,5.8 ) ( -2.2,6.6 )",
    "in this work we have studied numerically the behavior of random walks on small - world lattices .",
    "our work has focused on the probability of being at the initial site @xmath28 as a function of the number of steps @xmath16 .",
    "this quantity is found to show a complex , very interesting pattern : initially @xmath28 displays a power - law , `` quasi - fractal '' regime . at larger @xmath16",
    "a quicker decay takes over , reminiscent of stretched exponentials . in this respect",
    "the @xmath28 decay is intermediate between the decays found for fractal structures and the ones found for tree - like ( loop - less ) structures , exemplified here by cayley trees ."
