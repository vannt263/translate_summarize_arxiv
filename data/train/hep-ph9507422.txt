    "the method relies on a high - precision calculation of the cross section as a function of @xmath1 , and it is therefore important that higher - order corrections are under control .",
    "the qed coulomb correction is one of the most important of these , especially at threshold .",

    "in fact the corrections are numerically more important in the case of differential distributions , for example of the @xmath4 invariant mass or momentum @xcite , but even so their exact ( i.e. all - orders ) calculation appears to be unnecessary for the level of precision required at lep2 .    the first - order coulomb correction for the ( off - shell )",
