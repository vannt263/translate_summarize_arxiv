    "density measurements play an important role in the study and operation of magnetically confined plasmas .",
    "microwave reflectometry is a radar - like technique which infers the plasma density from the reflection on the ( cutoff ) layers where the refractive index vanishes @xcite .",
    "for example , for propagation perpendicular to the magnetic field with the electric field of the wave parallel to the magnetic field in the plasma ( o - mode ) , the refractive index is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the electron density , @xmath2 @xmath3 the plasma frequency , @xmath4 and @xmath5 the electronic charge and mass , @xmath6 the permittivity of the vacuum and @xmath7 the frequency of the probing wave .",
    "when the plasma frequency equals the probing frequency the index of refraction vanishes , the wave is reflected and the density @xmath8 of the cutoff layer may be derived from @xmath9 mixing the reflected wave @xmath10 with the ( reference ) incident wave @xmath11 , the mixer output is @xmath12 in the interference term @xmath13 , @xmath14 depends on many factors , microwave generator power , plasma scattering properties , turbulence , etc . , therefore it is @xmath15 that contains the most reliable information about the plasma density .",
    "the location @xmath16 of the reflecting layer for the frequency @xmath2 is related to the group delay @xmath17 by ( o - mode ) @xmath18 for a linear frequency sweep of the incident wave @xmath19 one obtains @xmath20 therefore , measurement of the plasma density hinges on an accurate determination of the instantaneous frequency  @xmath21 .",
    "accuracy in the measurement of this quantity is quite critical because , the location of the reflecting layer being obtained from the integral in ( [ 1.4 ] ) , errors tend to accumulate .",
    "several methods have been devised to obtain the group delay @xmath22 from the reflectometry data ( for a review see @xcite ) . among them , time - frequency analysis @xcite has been , so far , the most promising technique .",
    "the wigner - ville ( wv ) distribution @xcite @xcite although providing a complete description of the signal in the time - frequency plane , raises difficult interpretation problems due to the presence of many interference terms that impair the readability of the distribution .",
    "this occurs because the vw ( quasi-)distribution is not a probability distribution , has complex amplitudes and may have large amplitude values in frequency regions which are not contained in the signal spectrum . for this reason the time - frequency method that has been preferred is the spectrogram @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite , that is , the squared modulus of the short - time fourier transform @xmath23 @xmath24 being a peaked short - time window .",
    "the spectrogram does not really provide the instantaneous frequency , because that notion is not well defined anyway .",
    "all it gives is the product of the spectra of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the way the spectrogram",
    "is used to infer the local rate of phase variation @xmath27 is to identify this quantity with the maximum or the with the first moment of the spectrogram .",
    "an additional problem comes about because unwanted phase contributions due to plasma turbulence may have a higher amplitude than the contributions due to the profile .",
    "correction techniques have been developed to compensate for this errors , based for example on floyd s best path algorithm .",
    "the choice of the window function is also an important issue and , in particular , an adaptive spectrogram technique has been developed to maximize the time - frequency concentration @xcite .",
    "in addition to the delicate nature of the extraction of the phase derivative from an interference signal , another important question is the multicomponent structure of this signal .",
    "the signal that is actually received contains , in addition to the reflection on the plasma , reflections on the porthole and multi reflections of the waves on the wall of the vacuum vessel .",
    "separation of these latter components from the plasma reflections is an essential step to obtain reliable density results .",
    "separation by frequency filtering is not appropriate because there is considerable frequency overlap between the components . in a previous paper@xcite",
    "we have developed a method to separate the signal components based on a tomographic representation@xcite @xcite , which gives a positive density @xmath28  of the signal along all possible @xmath29-directions in the time - frequency plane .",
    "the tomogram representation @xmath28 gives , for @xmath30 the time representation of the signal , @xmath31 , and for @xmath32 the frequency representation , @xmath33 .",
    "frequency filtering corresponds to component separation of the signal at @xmath34 and , from the many examples that were studied , one concludes that , in general , this is not the most convenient direction to isolate the signal components .",
    "for example , for the reflectometry signals that were studied , we have more information if the separation of the components is performed at @xmath35 than at @xmath32 .    in the next section",
    "we first make a brief review of the tomographic method for component separation and then , using the same mathematical framework , show how one can obtain the phase derivative from the isolated components .",
    "finally , in the last two sections , the methods are applied both to simulated data and to actual reflectometry data collected in the tore supra .",
    "in @xcite we described in much detail the use of tomograms for the component factorization of complex signals . here",
    "we just recall some basic facts for the reader s convenience .",
    "we define a ( time - frequency ) tomogram as a family of probability distributions , @xmath36 associated to any signal @xmath31 , @xmath37 $ ] by    @xmath38    with @xmath39 notice that @xmath40 are spectral projections of an unitary operator @xmath41 and therefore ( [ 2.1 ] ) performs a spectral decomposition of the signal .",
    "first we select a subset of numbers @xmath42 in such a way that the corresponding family @xmath43 is orthogonal and normalized :    @xmath44    a glance at the shape of the functions ( [ 2.2 ] ) shows that , for fixed @xmath45 , the oscillation length at a given @xmath46 decreases when @xmath47 increase . as a result , the projection of the signal on the @xmath48 basis locally explores different scales . on the other hand",
    "the local time scale is larger when @xmath45 also becomes larger , in agreement with the uncertainty principle for a non - commuting pair of operators .",
    "we then consider the projections of a signal @xmath31    @xmath49    and use the coefficients @xmath50 for our signal processing purposes .",
    "in particular , a multi - component analysis of the signal@xcite is done by selecting subsets @xmath51 of the @xmath52 and reconstructing ( @xmath53-component ) partial signals by restricting the sum to    @xmath54    for each @xmath53-component .    in the present work",
    "we analyze the phase derivative of a complex signal @xmath55 and consider the cases where @xmath31 already corresponds to one of the components determined as in @xcite .",
    "that is , after a convenient factorization of the signal is performed , the search for the phase derivative is made on each component .    in the reflectometry technique",
    "the experimental signal is already complex ( it consists of one recorded interference term composed of in - phase and @xmath56 phase shifted signals ) .",
    "therefore we have no ambiguity in the definition of the amplitude and phase of @xmath31 .",
    "for other type of signals , where only the real part is available , the construction of a complementary imaginary part is an usual technique for which there are standard methods available in the signal analysis literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    given a signal @xmath57 the time derivative of the phase",
    "may be obtained from@xmath58for our decomposed components one has    @xmath59    with @xmath60and @xmath61    notice that an explicit analytic expression for @xmath62 is known , namely :    @xmath63    and therefore we obtain a direct expression for the phase derivative in terms of the coefficients @xmath50 without having to use the values of @xmath64 for neighboring values of @xmath46 .",
    "this provides a more robust method to estimate the derivative .",
    "we call the * tomographic direct method ( tdm ) * the method of the computation of the phase derivative of @xmath31 using ( [ 2.9 ] )",
    ".    notice that in the calculation of the imaginary part in ( [ 2.9a ] ) the value of the amplitude @xmath65 plays no role .",
    "therefore we may use what will be called a * tomographic normalized method ( tnm ) * defined in the same way as * tdm * but with a normalized signal @xmath66 replacing @xmath31 . for calculations on the signal carried out with absolute precision the results of * tdm * and * *  tnm * * should coincide . however because of numerical errors , normalization of the signal amplitude , before further processing , might have some merit mostly in the small amplitude regions .",
    "there are still two specific issues to be addressed when dealing with the reconstruction of the phase derivative of @xmath31 .",
    "the first is a general problem in signal analysis , namely denoising .",
    "we recall from @xcite that * tomogram - based denoising ( tbd ) * consists in eliminating from ( [ 2.11 ] ) the @xmath50 such that    @xmath67    for some chosen threshold @xmath68 .",
    "another way , often used for denoising , consists in locally smoothing the signal by computing a * local mean ( @xmath69 ) * @xmath70 of a function @xmath71 , known in the signal processing community as * moving average fir filter * of order @xmath72 by :    @xmath73    the second issue is how to handle the difficult problem of accurate measurement of the phase , hence also of the phase derivative , when the signal amplitude is very small .",
    "given a complex signal @xmath31 we define the *  truncated phase derivative ( tpd ) * by    @xmath74    if @xmath75 , for some convenient threshold @xmath76 ,    else    @xmath77    notice that * tpd * simply sets the value of the phase equal to a constant when the signal amplitude prevents its accurate estimation .",
    "in the following sections we present some advantages and drawbacks of these tools by applying them to several simulated and experimental signals .",
    "in this section we apply the general method to two types of simulated signals .",
    "the first example shows how the phase derivative of a sinusoidal signal may be computed with accuracy , even when noise is present . in the second example , we focus on the phase derivative of signals with non linear phase .",
    "our data consists of complex functions @xmath78 with phase and phase derivative @xmath79 unambiguously defined .",
    "the analysis of all the simulated signals is based on tomograms with @xmath80 as for the same data in @xcite .    for the simplest case ,",
    "the signal is :    @xmath81 s   \\label{3.1.1}\\ ] ]    * tdm * alone gives an excellent result ( mean value of the computed @xmath82 is @xmath83 and the standard deviation ( sdev ) @xmath84 to be compared with the fourier transform for which the resolution is equal to @xmath85 .",
    "if we add a ( complex ) noise @xmath86 to ( [ 3.1.1 ] ) with @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "] , * tdm * , not surprisingly , still shows a good mean result ( 75.9 rd / s ) but has a large uncertainty ( sdev=40 rd / s ) .",
    "the use of * lm * alone is not sufficient in this case ( sdev=3.5 rd / s for a * @xmath90 * ) but * tbd * allows a * tdm * with great accuracy ( sdev=0.8 rd / s ) that may even be improved by a ultimate use of a * lm * , ( sdev=0.6 rd / s for * @xmath91 * ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention how denoising using the spectral decomposition of the operator @xmath92 ( * tbd * ) works so efficiently , a result that is also confirmed in the subsequent examples .",
    "we proceed to the analysis of a signal which aims to mimic , in a simplified way , the case of an incident plus a reflected wave delayed in time and with an acquired time - dependent change in the phase . in this case",
    "the simulated signal @xmath93 is the sum of an `` incident '' chirp @xmath94 and a `` deformed reflected '' chirp @xmath95 .",
