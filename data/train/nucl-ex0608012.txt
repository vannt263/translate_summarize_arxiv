    "[ section ]    lattice qcd calculations predict that a phase transition from hadronic matter to a new state of matter called a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) occurs at sufficiently large energy densities @xcite .",
    "creation and study of such a de - confined state of matter is the primary goal of the heavy - ion collisions program at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) . a first order phase transition from the qgp back to normal hadronic matter is believed to delay the expansion of the hot reaction zone created in the collision @xcite .",
    "a delayed expansion means a long duration of particle emission , leading to a large source size .",
    "the measurement of the space - time extent of the particle emitting region has been one of the important goals in high energy experiments for several decades @xcite .",
    "these measurements are based on the sensitivity of particle momentum correlations to the space - time separation of the particle emitters due to the effects of quantum statistics ( qs ) and final state interaction(fsi ) . for identical particles ,",
    "the qs symmetrization ( antisymmetrization ) is usually the dominant source of the correlation and , due to the interference of the amplitudes corresponding to various permutations of identical particles , this measurement is often called particle interferometry ( see reference @xcite for a review ) .",
    "most of the particles produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions are pions and , as a result , pion interferometry has been a particularly useful tool in correlation studies .",
    "high statistics data from colliders like rhic have also made it possible to study kaon correlations . in this letter , we present the first results on two-@xmath0 correlations in central au - au collisions at @xmath7 gev measured by the star(solenoidal tracker at rhic ) experiment at rhic .",
    "it is known that a significant fraction of pions come from resonance decays after freeze - out thus complicating the pion interferometry measurements .",
    "while the direct pion source may be inherently non - gaussian , the resonances extend the source size due to their finite lifetime , introduce an additional essentially non - gaussian distortion in the two - pion correlator and reduce the fitted correlation strength .",
    "due to the limited decay momenta , the decay pions populate mainly the low momentum region , thus introducing an additional pair momentum dependence in the correlator .",
    "kaon interferometry , on the other hand , suffers less from resonance contributions and could provide a cleaner signal for correlation studies than pions @xcite .",
    "higher multi - particle correlation effects , that might play a role for pions , should be of minor importance for kaons since the kaon density is considerably smaller than the pion density at rhic ( @xmath8 gev ) .",
    "the pion multiplicity has increased by approximately @xmath9 from the sps(@xmath10 gev ) to rhic @xcite .",
    "the interferometry radii however remain almost the same @xcite .",
    "the strangeness distillation mechanism @xcite might further increase any time delay qgp signature .",
    "this mechanism could lead to strong temporal emission asymmetries between kaons and anti - kaons @xcite , thus probing the latent heat of the phase transition .",
    "particle identification for pions , via their specific ionization ( energy loss per unit length or @xmath11 ) , works only up to about 700 mev/@xmath12 .",
    "neutral kaons , on the other hand , can be identified up to much higher momentum using their decay topology .",
    "this allows for the extension of the interferometry systematics to a higher momentum than is presently achievable with pions , and thus provide a means to probe the earlier times of the collision .",
    "the effect of two - track resolution , which is a limiting factor in charged particle correlations , is also small .",
    "the absence of coulomb fsi suppression together with small contributions from resonance decays make neutral kaon correlations a powerful tool to investigate the space time structure of the particle emitting source .",
    "the opal @xcite and aleph @xcite collaborations have measured correlations of neutral kaons from hadronic decays of @xmath13 in @xmath14 collisions at lep .",
    "the wa97 experiment at cern @xcite attempted to measure @xmath15 correlations but did not see a significant enhancement of neutral kaon pairs in the region of small momentum difference due to a lack of sufficient statistics .",
    "the star detector @xcite consists of several detector subsystems in a large solenoidal magnet that provides a uniform 0.5 tesla field . for the data used in this analysis , the main setup consisted of the time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite for charged particle tracking , a scintillator trigger barrel ( ctb ) surrounding the tpc for measuring charged particle multiplicity , and two zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) @xcite located upstream and downstream along the axis of the tpc and beams to detect spectator neutrons . with full azimuthal coverage over @xmath16 and an almost @xmath17 efficiency for minimum ionizing particles ,",
    "the ctb provides a good estimate of the number of charged particles produced in the mid - rapidity region .",

    "the daughter particle tracks are required to have a minimum of 15 tpc hits and a distance of closest approach to the primary vertex greater than 1.3 cm .",
    "experimentally , the two - particle correlation function is defined as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 represents the distribution of the invariant relative momentum @xmath34 , for a pair of particles from the same event . the possibility of a single neutral kaon being correlated with itself , i.e. , correlation between a real @xmath0 and a fake @xmath0 reconstructed from a pair which shares a daughter of the real @xmath0 , was eliminated by requiring that kaons in a pair have unique daughters",
    "we have also explored effects from splitting of daughter tracks by looking at the angular correlation between the normal vectors to the decay planes of the @xmath0 in a given pair .",

    "this calls for a knowledge of the signal to background ratio within the selected invariant mass range to make corrections to the measured correlation function . for neutral kaons ,",
    "the decay length ( dl ) and distance of closest approach ( dca ) to the interaction vertex were two of the parameters for which it was difficult to determine where to apply the cuts .",
    "various dca and dl cut combinations were investigated by varying the dca from 0.3 cm to 0.8 cm in steps of 0.1 cm and the dl from 2.0 cm to 6.0 cm in steps of 1.0 cm .",
