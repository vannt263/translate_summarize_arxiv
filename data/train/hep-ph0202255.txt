    "the only clear indications we have of physics beyond this framework are the existence of neutrino mixing and , presumably , masses ( though some would say this physics is accommodated within the standard model ) ; the enormous range of masses , about @xmath7 , between the neutrinos and the top quark ; the need for a new source of cp  violation to account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe ; the likely presence of cold dark matter ; and , possibly , a very small , but nonzero , cosmological constant .",
    "these hints are powerful .",
    "but they are also obscure , and they do not point unambiguously to any particular extension of the standard model .",
    "in addition to these experimental facts , considerable theoretical discomfort and dissatisfaction with the standard model have dogged it from the beginning .",
    "all of it concerns the elementary higgs boson picture of electroweak and flavor symmetry breaking  the cornerstone of the standard model .",

    "elementary higgs models with grand unification have a _ hierarchy _ problem of widely different energy scales .",
    "4 .   elementary higgs models are _ trivial_. 5 .",
    "elementary higgs models provide no insight to _ flavor _ physics .    in nonsupersymmetric higgs models , there is no explanation why electroweak symmetry breaking occurs and why it has the energy scale of 1  tev .",
    "the higgs doublet self  interaction potential is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the vacuum expectation of the higgs field @xmath10 _ provided that _ @xmath11 .",
    "its experimental value is @xmath12 .",
    "but what dynamics makes @xmath13 ? what dynamics sets its magnitude ? in supersymmetric higgs models , the large top  quark yukawa coupling can drive @xmath14 positive ( by driving @xmath15 negative ) , but this just replaces one problem with another since we do nt know why the top s yukawa coupling is @xmath16",
    "furthermore , this electroweak symmetry breaking scenario requires the supersymmetric `` mu  term '' to be @xmath17 . why that value ?",
    "elementary higgs boson models are unnatural . the higgs boson s mass",

    "thus , there is no natural reason why @xmath19 and @xmath9 should be much less than the energy scale at which the essential physics of the model changes , e.g. , a unification scale or the planck scale of @xmath20 . to make @xmath19 very much less that @xmath21 , say 1  tev , the bare higgs mass must be balanced against its radiative corrections to the fantastic precision of a part in @xmath22 .    in grand ",
    "unified higgs boson models , supersymmetric or not , there are two very different scales of gauge symmetry breaking , the gut scale of about @xmath23 and the electroweak scale of a few 100  gev . this hierarchy is put in by hand , and must be maintained by unnaturally ",
    "fine tuning in ordinary higgs models , or by the `` set it and forget it '' nonrenormalization feature of supersymmetry .",
    "next , taken at face value , elementary higgs boson models are free field theories  @xcite . to a good approximation , the self",
    " coupling @xmath24 of the minimal one  doublet higgs boson at an energy scale @xmath25 is given by [ eq : lamtriv ] ( ) .",
    "this coupling vanishes for all @xmath25 as the cutoff @xmath26 is taken to infinity , hence the description `` trivial '' .",
    "this feature persists in a general class of two  higgs doublet models  @xcite and it is probably true of all higgs models .",
    "triviality really means that elementary ",
    "higgs lagrangians are meaningful only for scales @xmath25 below some cutoff @xmath27 at which new physics sets in .",
    "the larger the higgs couplings are , the lower the scale @xmath27 .",
    "this relationship translates into the so  called triviality bounds on higgs masses . for the minimal model ,",
    "the connection between @xmath19 and @xmath27 is [ eq : mtriv ] m_h ( _ ) v = 2 v . clearly , the cutoff has to be greater than the higgs mass for the effective theory to have some range of validity . from lattice ",

    "if the higgs boson is light , less than 200300  gev , as it is expected to be in supersymmetric models , this transition to a more fundamental theory may be postponed until very high energy , but what lies up there worries us nonetheless .    finally , in all elementary higgs models , supersymmetric or",
    "not , every aspect of flavor is completely mysterious , from the primordial symmetry defining the number of quark and lepton generations to the bewildering patterns of flavor breaking .",
    "the presence of higgs bosons has no connection to the existence of multiple and identical fermion generations .",
    "the flavor ",
    "symmetry breaking yukawa couplings of higgs bosons to fermions are arbitrary free parameters , put in by hand .",
    "as far as we know , this is a logically consistent state of affairs , and we may not understand flavor until we understand the physics of the planck scale .",
    "i do not believe this . and",
    ", i can not see how this problem , more pressing and immediate than any save electroweak symmetry breaking itself , can be so cavalierly set aside by those pursuing the `` theory of everything . ''",
    "the dynamical approach to electroweak and flavor symmetry breaking known as technicolor ( tc )  @xcite and extended technicolor ( etc )  @xcite emerged in the late 1970s in response to these shortcomings of the standard model .",
    "this picture was motivated first of all by the premise that _ every _ fundamental energy scale should have a dynamical origin .",
    "thus , the weak scale embodied in the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath32 should reflect the characteristic energy of a new strong interaction ",
    "technicolor  just as the pion decay constant @xmath33 reflects qcd s scale @xmath34 . for this reason ,",
    "i write @xmath35 to emphasize that this quantity has a dynamical origin .",
    "technicolor , a gauge theory of fermions with no elementary scalars , is modeled on the precedent of qcd : the electroweak assignments of quarks to left  handed doublets and right  handed singlets prevent their bare mass terms . if there are no elementary higgses to couple to , quarks have a large chiral symmetry , @xmath36 for three generations .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken to the diagonal ( vectorial ) @xmath37 subgroup when the qcd gauge coupling grows strong near @xmath38 .",
    "this produces 35 massless goldstone bosons , the `` pions '' . according to the higgs mechanism ",
    "whose operation requires no _ elementary _ scalar bosons  @xcite  this yields weak boson masses of @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "these masses are 1600 times too small , but they do have the right ratio .",
    "suppose , then , that there are fermions belonging to a complex representation of a new gauge group , technicolor ( taken to be @xmath40 ) , whose coupling @xmath41 becomes strong at @xmath42s of gev . if , like quarks , technifermions form left  handed doublets and right  handed singlets under @xmath43 , then they have no bare masses .",
    "when @xmath41 becomes strong , the technifermions chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , goldstone bosons appear , three of them become the longitudinal components of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and their masses are @xmath46 . here",
    ", @xmath47 is the decay constant of the linear combination of the absorbed `` technipions '' .",
    "technicolor , like qcd , is asymptotically free .",
    "this solves in one stroke the naturalness , hierarchy , and triviality problems ! the mass of all ground ",
    "state technihadrons , including higgs  like scalars ( though that language is neither accurate nor useful in technicolor ) is of order @xmath48 or less .",
    "there are no large renormalizations of bound state masses , hence no fine tuning of parameters .",
    "if the technicolor gauge symmetry is embedded at a very high energy @xmath26 in some grand unified gauge group with a relatively weak coupling , then the characteristic energy scale @xmath48where the coupling @xmath41 becomes strong enough to trigger chiral symmetry breaking  is naturally exponentially smaller than @xmath26 .",
    "finally , asymptotically free field theories are nontrivial . a minus sign in the denominator of the analog of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lamtriv ] ) for @xmath49 prevents one from concluding that it tends to zero for all @xmath25 as the cutoff is taken to infinity .",
    "no other scenario for the physics of the tev scale solves these problems so neatly . period .",
    "technicolor alone does not address the flavor problem .",
    "it does not tell us why there are multiple generations and it does not provide explicit breaking of quark and lepton chiral symmetries .",
    "something must play the role of higgs bosons to communicate electroweak symmetry breaking to quarks and leptons . furthermore , in all but the minimal tc model with just one doublet of technifermions , there are goldstone bosons , technipions @xmath50 , in addition to @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "these must be given mass and their masses must be more than 50100  gev for them to have escaped detection . extended technicolor ( etc ) was invented to address _ all _ these aspects of flavor physics  @xcite .",
    "it was also motivated by the desire to make flavor understandable at energies well below the gut scale solely in terms of _ gauge _ dynamics of the kind that worked so neatly for electroweak symmetry breaking , namely , technicolor .",
    "let me repeat : the etc approach is based on the gauge dynamics of fermions only .",
    "there can be _ no elementary scalar fields _ to lead us into the difficulties technicolor itself was invented to escape .",
    "in extended technicolor , ordinary @xmath53 color , @xmath40 technicolor , and flavor symmetries are unified into the etc gauge group , @xmath54 .",
    "we then understand flavor , color , and technicolor as subsets of the quantum numbers of extended technicolor .",
    "technicolor and color are exact gauge symmetries .",
    "flavor gauge symmetries are broken at one or more high energy scales @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a typical flavor gauge boson mass .    in these lectures ,",
    "i assume that @xmath54 commutes with electroweak @xmath57 . in this case",
    ", it must _ not _ commute with electroweak @xmath6 , i.e. , some part of that @xmath6 must be contained in @xmath54 .",
    "otherwise , there will be very light pseudogoldstone bosons which behave like classical axions and are ruled out experimentally  @xcite .",
    "more generally , all fermions ",
    "technifermions , quarks , and leptons  must form no more than four _ irreducible _ etc representations : two equivalent ones for left  handed up and down  type fermions and two inequivalent ones for right  handed up and down fermions ( so that up and down mass matrices are not identical ) .",
    "in other words , etc interactions explicitly break all _ global _ flavor symmetries so that there are no very light pseudogoldstone bosons or fermions .",
    "the energy scale of etc gauge symmetry breaking into @xmath58 is high , well above the tc scale of 0.11.0  tev .",
    "the broken gauge interactions , mediated by massive etc boson exchange , give mass to quarks and leptons by connecting them to technifermions ( figure  1a ) .",
    "they give mass to technipions by connecting technifermions to each other ( figure  1b ) .",
    "the graphs in figure  1 are convergent : the changes in chirality imply insertions on the technifermion lines of the momentum  dependent dynamical mass , @xmath59 .",
    "this function falls off as @xmath60 in an asymptotically free theory at weak coupling and , in any case , at least as fast as @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "for such a power law , the dominant momentum running around the loop is @xmath62 ( extending down to @xmath63 for a @xmath64 falloff of @xmath65 ) .",
    "then , the operator product expansion tells us that the generic quark or lepton mass and technipion mass are given by the expressions    -1.5truecm    [ eq : masses ] & & m_q ( ) m _ ( ) 2g_etc^2 t_l t_r _ etc ; + & & f^2_t m^2__t 2 t_l t_r t_r t_l _ etc . here , @xmath66 is the quark mass renormalized at @xmath56 .",

    "the vacuum expectation values @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the bilinear and quadrilinear technifermion condensates renormalized at @xmath56 .",
    "the bilinear condensate is related to the one renormalized at @xmath48 , expected by scaling from qcd to be [ eq : ctc ] t_l t_r _ tc = 2 f^3_t , by the equation [ eq : condrenorm ] = ( _ ^m_etc _ m ( ) ) . the anomalous dimension @xmath71 of the operator @xmath72 is given in perturbation theory by [ eq : gmm ] _ m ( ) = 3 c_2(r ) ( ) + o(^2 ) , where @xmath73 is the quadratic casimir of the technifermion @xmath40representation @xmath74 . for the fundamental representation of @xmath40 ,",
    "it is given by @xmath75 . finally , in the large@xmath76 approximation ( which will be questionable in the walking technicolor theories we discuss later , but which we adopt anyway for rough estimates ) [ eq : large_n ] t_l t_r t_r t_l _ etc t_l t_r_etc t_r t_l _ etc = ^2 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath56 and @xmath77 if we assume that technicolor is qcd  like  @xcite . in that case ,",
    "its asymptotic freedom sets in quickly ( or `` precociously '' ) at energies above @xmath48 and , so , @xmath78 for @xmath25 greater than a few times @xmath48 .",

    "@xmath80 is [ eq : letc ] _ etc .",
    "this is pretty low , but the estimate is rough .",
    "the typical technipion mass implied by this etc scale is [ eq : mpi ] m _ .",
    "finally , some phenomenological basics : in any model of technicolor , one expects bound technihadrons with a spectrum of mesons paralleling what we see in qcd .",
    "the principal targets of collider experiments are the spin  zero technipions and spin",
    " one isovector technirhos and isoscalar techniomegas . in the minimal one  technidoublet model ( @xmath81 ) , the three technipions are the longitudinal components @xmath82 of the massive weak gauge bosons .",
    "susskind pointed out that the analog of the qcd decay @xmath83 is @xmath84  @xcite . in the limit that @xmath85 , the equivalence theorem states that the amplitude for @xmath84 has the same form as the one for @xmath83 .",
    "if we scale technicolor from qcd and use large@xmath76 arguments , the strength of this amplitude is @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath88 mass and decay rate are  @xcite : [ eq : minrhot ] & & m _ = m_2 , + & & ( w_l w_l ) = 2p_w^3 500 ( 3 ) ^3/2 .    in the minimal model",
    ", a very high energy machine , such as the ill  fated superconducting super collider or the @xmath89 very large hadron collider or a @xmath90 linear collider is needed to discover the lightest technihadrons .",
    "decay mode of the @xmath88 is somewhat misguided  @xcite .",
    "since the minimal @xmath88 is so much heavier than @xmath91 , this mode may be suppressed by the high @xmath92momentum in its decay form factor .",
    "then , the @xmath88 decays to four or more weak bosons may be competitive or even dominant .",
    "this means that the minimal @xmath88 may be wider than indicated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : minrhot ] ) and , in any case , that its decays are much more complicated than previously thought .",
    "furthermore , walking technicolor  @xcite , discussed below , implies that the spectrum of technihadrons can not be exactly qcd  like .",
    "rather , there must be something like a tower of technirhos extending almost up to @xmath93 several 100  tev .",
    "whether or not these would appear as discernible resonances is an open question  @xcite .",
    "all these remarks apply as well to the isoscalar @xmath94 and its excitations . ] in nonminimal models , where @xmath95 , the signatures of technicolor ought to be accessible at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and at a comparable lepton collider . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the many technifermions needed for walking technicolor and topcolor  assisted technicolor ( see below ) mean that signatures are likely to be within reach of the tevatron collider in run  ii !",
    "technicolor and extended technicolor are challenged by a number of phenomenological hurdles , but the most widely cited causes of the `` death of technicolor '' ( prematurely announced , like mark twain s ) are flavor  changing neutral current interactions ( fcnc )  @xcite , precision measurements of electroweak quantities ( stu )  @xcite , and the large mass of the top quark .",
    "we discuss these in turn .",
    "extended technicolor interactions are expected to have flavor  changing neutral currents involving quarks and leptons .",
    "the reason is simple : realistic quark mass matrices require etc transitions between different flavors , @xmath96 , or technifermion mixing so that @xmath97 . in the first case",

    "no satisfactory gim mechanism has ever been found that eliminates these fcnc interactions  @xcite .",
    "the most stringent constraint on etc comes from @xmath104 interactions .",

    "this `` vector meson dominance '' of the spectral integrals is related to the precocious onset of asymptotic freedom in qcd .",

    "however , walking technicolor suggests that there are @xmath162 and @xmath88 starting near or not far above @xmath163  @xcite .",
    "we have seen that extended technicolor can not explain the top quark s large mass .",
    "an alternative approach was developed in the early 90s based on a new interaction of the third generation quarks .",

    "experiments will be of great help , possibly inspiring the right new ideas .",
    "certainly , experiments that will be done in this decade will rule out , or vindicate , the ideas outlined in these lectures . that is an exciting prospect !",

    "is there some simple way to tinker with the basic etc mass  generating mechanism , some way to implement a seesaw mechanism , or must the whole etc idea be scrapped ?",
    "the area is wide open .",
    "my favorite problem is `` vacuum alignment '' and cp violation  @xcite ; this will be the subject of lecture  ii .",
    "the basic idea is this : spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking implies the existence of infinitely many degenerate ground states .",
    "these are manifested by the presence of massless goldstone bosons ( technipions ) .",
    "the `` correct '' ground state , i.e. , the one on which consistent chiral perturbation theory for the technipions is to be carried out , is the one which minimizes the vacuum expectation value of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking hamiltonian @xmath211 generated by etc . as dashen discovered , it is possible that an @xmath211 that appears to conserve cp actually violates it in the correct ground state .",
    "this provides a beautiful dynamical mechanism for the cp violation we observe . or it could lead to disaster  strong cp violation , with a neutron electric dipole moment ten orders of magnitude larger than its upper limit of @xmath212cm  @xcite .",
    "this field of research is just beginning in earnest . if the strong  cp problem can be controlled ( and we shall see that there is reason to hope it can be ! ) , there may be several new sources of cp violation that are accessible to experiment .",

    "this hamiltonian has as its symmetry group @xmath217 , the group of rotations in three dimensions .",

    "we say that @xmath226 has _ spontaneously broken _ to @xmath227 .",

    "if we fail to do this , then we generally find pseudogoldstone bosons ( pgbs ) with _ negative _ @xmath237 .",
    "indeed , @xmath238 is the hallmark of working with the wrong ground state .    vacuum alignment in a lorentz  invariant quantum field theory proceeds as follows  @xcite : we start with an unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath233 with symmetry group @xmath229 .",

    "<S> a scenario for cp violation is presented based on vacuum alignment for technifermions and quarks . </S>",
    "<S> it has the novel feature of cp  violating phases that are rational multiples of @xmath0 to better than one part in @xmath1 _ without _ fine  tuning of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme thereby avoids light axions and a massless up quark . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing of neutral mesons , the mechanism of top  quark mass generation , and the cp  violating parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 strongly constrain the form of etc  generated quark mass matrices .    </S>",
