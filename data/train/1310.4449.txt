    "the phenomenon of self - interaction force experienced by an electric charge placed in an arbitrary gravitational field was analyzed for the first time by dewitt and brehme @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the self - force is induced by the interaction of the electromagnetic field generated by the electric charge and the curvature of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "this interaction modifies the electrostatic potential in such a way that the electric charge experiences a finite self - force .",
    "this is an example of how the self - force on a charged particle held fixed in a gravitational field depends on the local aspects ( geometry ) of the spacetime .",
    "in fact , the self - interaction force depends not only on the geometry of the spacetime but also on the global features of the spacetime .",
    "this can be understood as a manifestation of non - local ( topological ) influence of gravity on the electromagnetic field , and means that non - local aspects of the gravitational fields are of fundamental importance in describing this physical system .",
    "in other words , the intrinsic geometry of the space is not sufficient to describe completely the interaction of the electromagnetic field produced by an electric charge and the gravitational field .",
    "a scenario in which we can investigate the topological features of the interaction between an electromagnetic and a gravitational field is the spacetime produced by a thin , infinite and straight cosmic string @xcite , which looks like the direct product of the two - dimensional minkowski space and a cone , and thus it is locally flat but not globally .",
    "the metric outside a cosmic string positioned along of the @xmath0 axis can be written , in cylindrical coordinates , as @xmath1 where the domain of the azimuthal angle is @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass per unit length of the string .",
    "note that we can redefine the azimuthal angle in such a way that @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the metric expressed in eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) is actually a locally flat one , which means that the spacetime of an infinitely thin cosmic string may be regarded as the minkowski spacetime with a deficit angle @xmath8 .",
    "this lack of global flatness of the cosmic string spacetime originates an electrostatic self - force on a charged particle , investigated in @xcite-@xcite , on a linear charge distribution @xcite , on a mean charge density @xcite , on an electric dipole in presence of a point mass and in the context of planar gravity @xcite , or on an electric dipole held fixed parallel to the cosmic string @xcite .",
    "the self - forces on a particle @xcite and on a distribution of charges @xcite , placed in other locally minkowski space - times , also were analysed .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate how the self - force phenomenon induced by the global features of the gravitational field of a cosmic string manifests itself on an electric dipole held fixed in different configurations , as for example , parallel , perpendicular to the cosmic string and oriented along the azimuthal direction ( orthogonal ) , and in what way these forces depend on the parameter which defines the deficit angle of the spacetime under consideration .",
    "a similar problem has been already investigated using the retarded green s function @xcite associated with the electromagnetic field of a electric dipole and of other static distributions of charge , in the spacetime of a straight , thin and infinite cosmic string .",
    "it was shown that these sources are influenced by the cosmic string through a self - interaction with their fields . in our paper , the self - interaction on an electric dipole placed in the cosmic string spacetime was derived by a different method which was the same one used in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we revise the renormalized green s function method , necessary for the calculation of self - energy on an electric charge . in sections",
    "iii , iv and v we obtain the self - energy and use this result to calculate the self - force on a point electric dipole when it is parallel , perpendicular and orthogonal to the cosmic string , respectively .",
    "we also obtain for each configuration the graphs which describes how the self - force depends on the parameter which defines the deficit angle .",
    "we discuss our results in sec.vi .",

    ", we have @xmath16 the subscript in nabla operator designates derivative with respect to @xmath17 coordinates , and @xmath18 are the coordinates which localize the position of the electric dipole .",
    "thus , using the expression for the self - energy of a continuum system of charges , @xmath19 and taking into account the appropriate renormalized green s function for point charges , the self - energy of an electric dipole at the point @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 or , using the properties of the delta function , we get @xmath22_{x''=x}\\big\\}_{x'=x}.\\ ] ] using eq .",

    "in the present case , the self - force can be also seen as resulting from an electrostatic interaction of the real electric dipole with an effective dipole moment @xmath54 parallel to the former and situated along the @xmath0 axis .",

    "we note here great differences with respect to the other configurations .",
    "firstly , the self - force on the orthogonal electric dipole is attractive .",
    "secondly , the intensity of self - force is many orders of magnitude less than the observed in previous ones .",
    "the self - force also can be seen as the result of an interaction of the real electric dipole with another effective dipole parallel to the former , placed at the position of the cosmic string , but with effective dipole moment given by @xmath60 .",
    "we have calculated the self - interaction energy of a point electric dipole , placed at the spacetime of a straight , infinite , thin and static cosmic string , and used this result to find the self - force .",
    "these calculations were based on the renormalized green s function formalism .",
    "we found that such self - forces are repulsive , for both perpendicular and parallel configurations , and attractive for the orthogonal one . in all cases ,",
    "the self - force can be seen as a force exerted on the real electric dipole caused by the presence of an effective one held fixed at the cosmic string position , whose dipole moment depends on the characteristics of the cosmic string , codified in the parameter @xmath3 defined in terms of the linear mass density of the cosmic string .",
    "the resulting self - force , considering the three independent directions , is given by @xmath61\\textbf{e}_{\\rho}+\\sqrt{2}h(\\nu)\\textbf{e}_{\\theta}+g(\\nu)\\textbf{e}_z\\},\\ ] ] and a general expression for the self - torque is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the completely antisymmetric tensor in three spatial dimensions and @xmath64 is given by the sum of equations ( 14a ) , ( 19a ) and ( 21 ) .",
    "we call attention to the fact that the total self - force on the electric dipole is not a mere superposition of self - forces on each particle that forms the dipole .",
    "the reason that the self - force of the dipole is not just a sum of self - forces of both charges forming it can be explained using the fact that , in the cosmic string spacetime , there is an additional interaction between both charges caused by the non - trivial topological properties of that spacetime .    from the graphs that display the dependence of the self - forces on the parameter @xmath3 , associated with the presence of the cosmic string",
    ", we found that the self - interaction forces on both parallel and perpendicular dipoles practically have the same values and that the self - force on the electric dipole aligned in the direction of the azimuthal angle is several orders of magnitude weaker as compared with the two other configurations .",
    "we consider in this analysis that each electric dipole is formed by elementary charges and that the distance between them is around @xmath65 , as well as that they are situated at a distance of @xmath48 from the cosmic string .    beyond to investigate the interaction of cosmic strings with electric dipoles , which can be applied to study the interaction of complex molecules in interstellar and intergalactic media in order to detect the possible presence of cosmic strings , the results of this paper can be used , in principle , in condensed matter physics , through the analogy between cosmic strings and disclinations in solids , with the aim to understand the interaction of these defects with polar molecules .",
