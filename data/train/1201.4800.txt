    "the discovery , at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , of a `` perfect fluid '' hadronizing via `` quark coalescence '' @xcite has aroused a lot of experimental and theoretical attention . the main experimental evidence to support perfect fluidity is the observation that elliptic flow @xmath0 , defined as the 2nd fourier coefficient in the particle spectrum wrt the reaction plane @xmath1 @xmath2 approaches the value expected from hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the further scaling of mesonic and baryonic @xmath0 is suggestive of what is seen by the most naive quark coalescence : @xmath3 @xmath4 provided the wigner functions @xcite @xmath5 are @xmath6-functions in position and momentum , @xmath7 @xcite , a relation that holds surprisingly well at the top rhic energy of 200 gev per nucleon @xcite , even if signs of finite width wigner functions have been identified @xcite .",
    "the most common interpretation of this is that the degrees of freedom carrying elliptic flow are partonic @xcite .",
    "coalescence of partonic degrees of freedom is also hinted by the high @xmath8 baryon distribution @xcite , and can account for 2-particle correlations structures such as the near - side `` ridge '' @xcite and the far - side `` cone '' @xcite .",
    "it has been found to significantly affect also the nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow of heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "it is , however , far from clear how the flow data and its `` partonic ideal fluid '' interpretation is related to the onset of deconfinement . in the confined phase",
    ", the coupling constant between mesons goes as @xmath9 @xcite while the density of degrees of freedom , impacting both viscosity @xmath10 and entropy density @xmath11 , goes as @xmath12 .",
    "hence , @xmath13 . in the deconfined phase the density of degrees of freedom goes as @xmath14 ,",
    "hence @xmath15 independently of the coupling constant .",
    "@xmath16 should respectively go to a constant for strongly interacting theories @xcite or go as @xmath17 in the perturbative regime @xcite , both @xmath18 .",
    "hence , simple number of colors scaling @xcite shows that at deconfinement @xmath16 should jump by an order of magnitude .",
    "if elliptic flow is indeed hydrodynamically generated , a corresponding jump should be observed when the initial temperature is about the critical temperature for deconfinement @xcite .",
    "no such jumps in the elliptic flow observable are apparent in experimental data , whether varied in center of mass energy , centrality or rapidity @xcite .",
    "seeing how the @xmath0 observable `` turns off '' is indeed one of the objectives of making _ lower _ energy measurements with the latest detectors @xcite .",
    "recently , the rhic experimental energy scan started observing a systematic breakdown of coalescence in @xmath19 ( not seen , so far , in rapidity @xcite ) which has been interpreted as signifying the `` turning off '' of partonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , such conclusion is premature : even if quark coalescence persists , high baryochemical potential and small rapidity intervals in the collision region might be enough to make it not apparent when @xmath0 of mesons and baryons is considered .    in this work",
    "we explore the consequences of the rapidity dependence of both @xmath20 and @xmath21 on the quark number scaling and on the baryon and anti - baryons splitting of the elliptic flow , pointing out that recent observations of the rhic experiments at low energy are not explicable neither by a pure hydrodynamical+coalescence model nor by a pure hadronic model .",
    "our model is simplified to capture the main issues we want to deal with .",
    "we assume _ all _ @xmath0 is produced in a close - to - ideal hydrodynamic stage at _ all _ energies .",
    "the main consequence of an ideal hydrodynamics stage for our purposes is that , locally in rapidity and co - moving time , flow @xmath22 is species independent . for configuration space coordinates @xmath23 , while _ abundances _ of flavors can vary , @xmath24 this is simply a consequence of the fact that in ideal fluids any conserved current @xmath25 , and deviations from this relation are invariably dissipative @xcite .",
    "this is _ independent _ of the initial condition for hydrodynamic evolution allowing to draw qualitative conclusions from an admittedly simplified schematic model .",
    "hence , before hadronization , provided flavor content is homogeneous in the transverse plane , for quarks emitted at rapidity @xmath26 and transverse momentum @xmath8 we have , up to mass corrections @xmath27    the other important ingredient to define the partonic stage is the @xmath26 and @xmath8 dependence of quark and antiquark distribution function .",
    "we assume a gaussian antiquark distribution ( fig .",
    "[ dndy ] ) @xmath28 f(p_t , \\phi)\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is approximately @xmath30 , growing from @xmath31 to @xmath32 between the landau and bjorken limits @xcite .    for the quark distribution ,",
    "we assume a flat distribution for a rapidity region @xmath33 meaning the probability of finding a valence quark is approximately invariant with rapidity .",
    "this appears quite reasonable at least if the beam energy is @xmath34 , @xmath35 the normalization can be fixed by the @xmath36 ratio @xmath37^{1/3}\\ ] ] experimentally decreasing with @xmath19 , as more entropy is carried by pre - existing valence quarks rather than created @xmath38 pairs .",
    "strange quarks and antiquarks distribution is the same as antiquarks , since they are produced from zero in the hot medium .",
    "while these are undoubtedly simplified assumptions , more complicated scenarios @xcite would , provided they model the experimentally observed limiting fragmentation of @xmath0 and @xmath20 @xcite and eq .",
    "[ hydroass ] , give qualitatively similar results to those we present .",
    "this is because in any such system the bulk of antiquarks and strange quarks would come from a central plateau , whose width @xmath39 grows very slowly with @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the central plateau is also the region closest to ideal hydrodynamics , at all energies .    in accord with the hydrodynamic hypothesis for the quark phase ,",
    "the momentum distribution is independent of the quark flavor ( @xmath40 have the same @xmath41 and @xmath0 ) . hence , a similar @xmath42 describes both @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45\\ ] ] and @xmath46 . to fit experimental data @xcite , the quark ( antiquark and strange quark ) @xmath0 distribution for partons",
    "is also gaussian :    @xmath47    @xmath48 is an empirical function compatible with experimental data .",
    "its integral is fixed by the experimental constraint @xcite @xmath49 , where s is the overlap area of the collision @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 is assumed , as seems to be the case in experimental data @xcite , to have the same @xmath52 as the `` hot '' medium ( antiquark and strange quark distributions ) .",
    "note that even if @xmath53 is the same for all partons _ locally _ , this is not true for @xmath54 integrated over a finite @xmath26 region .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "2 , we show @xmath55 for quarks ( up triangles ) and antiquarks / strange quarks ( down triangles ) for two different widths .",
    "this difference is due to the different @xmath20 distributions for quarks and antiquarks together with the rapidity dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "anti - quarks have the largest @xmath20 from @xmath56 region because at finite @xmath26 @xmath20 has a gaussian - like tail @xmath57 since @xmath0 is maximum at @xmath58 , this generally leads to @xmath59 . since the wigner function is also approximately a gaussian , a similar mechanism acts also in the coalescence process leading to a smaller flow for mesons with both an @xmath44 and an @xmath11 quark , such as @xmath60 , with respect to those having a @xmath61 or @xmath62 .    to study the @xmath0 of hadrons in the @xmath8 range @xmath63 \\ , { \\hbox{gev}}$ ] we assume coalescence - type hadronization that for the case of mesons is given by @xmath64 the relative phase space coordinates @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the four - vector relative space - time distance and energy - momentum .",
    "@xmath67 is a volume element of a space - like hyper - surface .",
    "the hyper - surface of coalescing partons is fixed through the condition of equal longitudinal proper time @xmath68 @xcite . in the coalescence integral in eq.([coal ] ) we consider the full phase space overlap of the coalescing particles , with the advantage of avoiding some of the more restrictive approximations employed by other coalescence models .",
    "in particular the extended 3d wigner function avoids any collinear approximations in momentum .",
    "the hadron wigner function for light quarks used is a simple product of spheres in position and momentum space @xmath69\\times\\ ] ] @xmath70.\\ ] ] the radii @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the wigner formalism obey the relation @xmath73 , motivated by the uncertainty principle .",
    "similar expression can be derived for 3-quarks coalescence .",
    "the parameter @xmath74 is taken to be different for baryons and mesons and is of the order of the fermi momentum , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this has been shown to account for both the @xmath77 spectra at rhic energy and quark number scaling elliptic flow including its small baryon / meson breaking @xcite .",
    "the condition for the 4-vector relative momentum can be written as : @xmath78 in the non - relativistic limit @xmath79 this reduces to the condition @xmath80 , i.e. that the relative momentum , and hence also the difference in rapidity , of the coalescing quarks is limited to the width of the hadron wave function .    in the ultra - relativistic limit @xmath81 eq.([prel ] ) reduces to : @xmath82 < \\delta_p^2\\ ] ] which implies that at large @xmath8 , due to the lorentz boost from the fireball frame to the coalescing quark frame , particles with relatively large @xmath83 can coalesce .",
    "this effect @xcite follows from relativistic kinematics and leads in our case to an increasing difference between particle and anti - particle @xmath54 as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "while in previous work the elliptic flow of coalescence was studied considering flat distribution in rapidity , we show that in presence of a finite wigner function in eq .",
    "[ coaldyn ] and a @xmath84dependent anti - quark density the naive quark number scaling breaks down and a difference in baryon - antibaryon @xmath0 appears _ even if ideal partonic hydrodynamics and coalescence occur at all energies_. while such a scenario is usually assumed not to apply for lower energies ( this is very different from `` demonstratively falsified '' ) , it is worthwhile to estimate the magnitude of these effects .",
    "the meson and baryon @xmath0 s are summarized in fig .",
    "as can be seen , the @xmath85 naive scaling is considerably broken when @xmath86 asymmetry is broken and the width of distribution is sufficiently narrow . when @xmath87 , the proton @xmath88 is below the meson one by nearly @xmath89 while the antiproton one is above it . @xmath90 and @xmath60 are similarly very different , while the difference between @xmath91 and @xmath92 is smaller , see fig .",
    "3 , because the difference comes only from one over three quarks instead of one over two .",
    "all of these can be readily explained by the greater admixture of high - flow antiquarks and strange quarks in anti - baryons and strange hadrons . in the @xmath93 , for instance ,",
    "_ both _ quarks tend to come from smaller @xmath94 where the flow is larger , while in @xmath90 only one does .",
    "hence , @xmath95 has a higher @xmath54 .",
    "up to an asymmetry of @xmath96 the breaking of the scaling is still sizable but start to emerge when the transverse momentum per constituent quark is @xmath97 gev . with @xmath98 the usual",
    "scaling are essentially restored .",
    "we notice that in a realistic description also thermal smearing should be included destroying the `` locality '' in momentum rapidity of the parton distribution and mixing quarks from flowing central region with the more baryon - rich fragmentation region .",
    "this effect with @xmath99 , produces a similar effect to the one we have investigated for coalescence with finite width wave function , therefore the lowering of baryon @xmath0 would persist even if @xmath100 as long as @xmath36 breaks boost invariance .    our other main result , showing in fig .",
    "[ v2bar ] , is that @xmath0 is higher for anti - baryons than for baryons .",
    "the difference is noticeable at all @xmath8 if the width in rapidity of the antiquark and strange quark distribution is @xmath101 , but becomes noticeable at higher @xmath102 gev only , if the width increases to @xmath103 .",
    "a further increase of the width makes the limiting @xmath8 of the difference even higher .",
    "this result is stable against changes in the details of parton distributions as long as eq .",
    "[ hydroass ] and the decreasing @xmath104 as a function of rapidity are valid assumptions , since baryons admit an admixture of quarks from the high rapidity peripheral regions , where @xmath0 is smaller , while anti - baryons are dominated by central rapidity region at larger @xmath0 .",
    "any coalescence incorporating finite width wave function will result in a higher @xmath0 for anti - baryons w.r.t",
    ". baryons .",
    "however , this directly contradicts experimental data @xcite , suggesting either that coalescence breaks down at lower energies , or that quarks and antiquarks do not have the same flow @xmath53 .",
    "at this point one may ask if at lower energy what we have created is just a pure hadron gas .",
    "the systematics of @xmath54 , overlapping for all accessible momenta between @xmath19 of 7.7 gev and lhc energies @xcite , makes different regimes of @xmath0 origin immediately suspect .",
    "nevertheless , to investigate also this possibility we have calculated the @xmath0 of protons and antiprotons in purely hadronic molecular dynamics , implemented via the urqmd model @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the version we used , v2.3 @xcite , suffers , as in earlier versions , from lack of detailed balance for multi - particle reactions : annihilation processes involving multi - particle final states , such as @xmath105 are possible .",
    "the corresponding creation processes , however , are absent .",
    "quantitatively , this is a minor correction , since its equilibration time for @xmath106 processes @xmath107 , and , as urqmd shows , even @xmath108 processes do not equilibrate in realistic heavy ion collision expansion profiles",
    ". however , in high chemical potential systems antiprotons themselves are also minor correction , being suppressed by factors of @xmath109 , so the _ relative _ importance of multi - particle processes could become enhanced .",
    "the reason this happens is however somewhat different : antiprotons are produced initially , and get absorbed by annihilation in a proton - rich medium . neglecting regeneration",
    ", it is not surprising that in a hadronic medium protons and antiprotons propagate differently : their thermally averaged interaction cross - sections are considerably different , since protons typically interact via resonance formation while antiprotons , in a high chemical potential medium , can interact _ both _ via resonance formation and collisional processes and annihilation , with the latter dominating if the knudsen number is large and @xmath0 is created by absorption rather than flow .",
    "this , however , already makes it likely that antiprotons be _ more _ anisotropic , both due to flow and absorption , simply because they interact more with the medium .",
    "once again , naive extrapolation seems to disagree with experimental data @xcite , _ either _ purely hadronic dynamics nor the coalescence hadronization of a partonic fluid .",
    "ref.@xcite proposed to explain this by assuming @xmath0 of particles transported from high rapidity is _ higher _ than the @xmath0 of particles created at mid - rapidity .",
    "it is however difficult to see how such an ansatz is compatible with the scaling of @xmath0 with rapidity @xcite , since `` transported '' degrees of freedom have to come , and spend more time in , _ less _ flowing regions .",
    "our work confirms , in fact , that both partonic and hadronic dynamics , considering longitudinal diffusion _ only _ , have the opposite dependence on rapidity than that claimed in @xcite .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "_ transverse _ ideal hydrodynamics , incorporating instant chemical and thermal equilibrium for all hadronic species , might provide a way out , via chemical composition anisotropy in the transverse plane . if flow is created close to the ideal hydrodynamic limit , outer regions in transverse space have significantly more flow than inner - lying regions .",
    "the @xmath110 ratio , however , decreases with transverse radius since most @xmath111 are formed in the higher density inner regions : in the outer regions @xmath112 is approximately the same but @xmath113 goes down , depleting the @xmath36 ratio .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this effect can drive @xmath0 of protons above @xmath0 of antiprotons .",
    "however , coalescence in this case is also not ruled out , since by exactly the same reasoning , given a partonic system with @xmath86 transverse anisotropy , one can drive the mean flow of quarks above the mean flow of anti - quarks , effective relaxing the assumption of eq .",
    "[ v2eq ] , @xmath114 : _ locally in transverse space _ flow is of course still the same for all species , but the inhomogeneity leads to different transverse - averaged flows .",
    "[ v2diff ] shows what happens if the effective @xmath115 is just 20@xmath116 of those of the antiquarks , a comparable effect to that used in @xcite ( the exact magnitude of the @xmath86 transverse anisotropy should be approximately insensitive to whether urqmd or `` partonic '' initial conditions are used ) .",
    "partonic chemical non - equilibrium at freeze - out might accentuate this imbalance @xcite , since at @xmath117 light quarks equilibrate radiatively while light antiquarks equilibrate collisionally .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that 2 + 1 _ partonic _ hydro+coalescence might also be consistent with lower energies rhic data if the transverse radius dependence of elliptic flow is taken into account . since , as discussed previously , strange quarks are chemically similar to light antiquarks in that they are created thermally , we expect , if this scenario is correct , that + @xmath118 .",
    "alternatively , differential quark - antiquark flow can be directly realized in a system with either partonic or hadronic degrees of freedom _ and _ strong vector mean fields , since the repulsive channel at finite net quark number will generally be greater for @xmath119 than @xmath120 ( nb , both light and strange quarks ) .",
    "vector mean fields , unlike scalar ones , can produce a difference between quarks and antiquarks because they admit both attractive and repulsive channels , and are sensitive to a conserved charge density such as the net baryon or quark density .    in a medium with positive chemical potential , vector",
    "mean fields should cause relatively more attraction between anti - particles and the higher baryonic density regions , and therefore a smaller @xmath54 for antiparticles with respect to the particles . as shown in @xcite within boltzmann transport theory an attractive mean",
    "field cause a significant reduction of the @xmath54 .",
    "this can ultimately be related , in a hydrodynamical picture , to the fact that an attractive mean field decreases the effective pressure of the system at equilibrium .",
    "while elliptic flow is thought to be driven by pressure gradients , it remains to be clarified up to what level the transport and hydrodynamic picture are equivalent .      a model with _",
    "mean fields has also been recently conjectured and studied within njl @xcite and pnjl models @xcite .",
    "as @xcite have shown quark degrees of freedom coupled to mean fields can produce sizable elliptic flows @xcite which , in a vector channel , can again vary considerably between quarks and antiquarks .",
    "if , in the partonic system , the effect of mean fields is comparable to isotropic pressure , however , the very definition of thermalization and @xmath16 needs to be revised , since defining a co - moving frame within a strong mean field is impossible : particles and antiparticles will always move in different directions within a volume element , exactly the effect required to explain energy scan data .",
    "this also means that if @xmath0 is driven by mean fields , one would expect the difference between baryon and anti - baryon @xmath0 to be constant with strangeness , since qcd dynamics is flavor - blind + @xmath121 + this latter scenario , however , leads to some unsettling questions for the interpretation of @xmath0 at _ higher _ energies : since at @xmath122 such effects become invisible ( c - symmetry of the medium is restored ) , there is no indication that they actually turn off at rhic / lhc , and the smoothness of the decrease of the @xmath123 with @xmath19 @xcite suggests they do not . as mean fields are `` large '' deviations from the hydrodynamic limit , discovering that they have a contribution to _ creating _ ( rather than suppressing ) @xmath124 could significantly modify viscosity estimates such as those at higher energies @xcite .    to constrain the models further using existing data , let us consider that the _ total _",
    "( @xmath125 ) @xmath54 in the same energy scan can be experimentally shown @xcite to be approximately independent of the initial density ( which depends , approximately , as @xmath126 @xcite assuming bjorken expansion @xcite with a constant starting time ) ; the integrated @xmath0 varies because @xmath41 increases systematically with @xmath127 , but @xmath54 overlaps within error bar @xcite .",
    "the analysis in fig . [ urqmd ] also fails to reproduce such a scaling specifically for protons , in line with the interpretation of absorption as the dominant origin of @xmath0 ; in this case , the @xmath0 scaling with @xmath8 should be governed by the collision integral formula of @xcite , where transverse density enters both into @xmath41 and @xmath54 via @xmath128 here @xmath129 is the normalized cross - section times negative velocity for _ that particular transverse momentum_. neglecting averaging over rapidity , and assuming @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the momentum transfer and @xmath132 is the momentum of the second scatterer , we get @xmath133 @xmath134 where we used the universal scaling of the transverse momentum distribution with @xmath135 noted in @xcite and @xmath136 is a distribution function , which can be well approximated by a tsallis spectrum @xcite .",
    "the @xmath137 term generally breaks the scaling , increasing @xmath54 by virtue of an increase in @xmath41 with @xmath138 and decreasing @xmath54 at the high @xmath139 tail . in case of high baryochemical potential limit at low @xmath19",
    ", the averaging of @xmath41 over @xmath140 and @xmath141 over @xmath142 further breaks the scaling .",
    "this systematic shift is also visible in fig.11 of @xcite or in @xcite within the urqmd and ampt models , as @xmath54 increases systematically with @xmath19 .",
    "the same reasoning explains the systematic rise specific to @xmath143 observed in fig .",
    "[ urqmd ] .",
    "however , as explicitly discussed in @xcite but clear from @xcite , an ideal fluid stage creating @xmath0 via azimuthally inhomogeneus pressure gradients will _ not _ ameliorate this problem , since a cooper - frye freeze - out @xcite will result in a @xmath0 which to leading order depends on the 2nd fourier components of the freeze - out hyper - surface @xmath144 and transverse flow @xmath145 via @xmath146 \\left(e - p_t \\epsilon_2^{\\sigma_t }    \\right)+ p_t \\epsilon_2^{\\sigma_t }    \\right\\rangle}\\ ] ] and the averaging @xmath147 is done over events at a given @xmath19 and centrality class .",
    "since both @xmath148 and @xmath149 depend on the lifetime of the system ( albeit approximately saturate after a finite time @xcite ) , @xmath54 should also systematically rise with @xmath19 .",
    "the systematic deviation should increase with @xmath8 , since both @xmath150 come with factors @xmath8 .",
    "such a behavior is indeed evident in @xcite , and is qualitatively the same as the transport simulation @xcite .    in the recent years it has been point out that an agreement with data for several observables even at the highest rhic energy can be better explained if one introduce a core - corona model @xcite .",
    "the fact that ampt , which incorporates both hadronic and partonic components in the relevant energy density regimes , has the same qualitative dependence as @xcite ( as seen in @xcite fig .",
    "11 ) indicates that a core - corona model might find it challenging to reproduce @xmath54 for all energies , since the greater preponderance of the corona at lower @xmath19 should also change the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath0 ( @xmath0 in the corona is either zero or hadronic ) .",
    "however , since a core - corona model with an ideal core ( @xmath151 ) does a good job of reproducing integrated @xmath152 at several top energies and centralities @xcite , and @xmath151 is expected to scale the best @xcite , perhaps the scaling of @xmath0 will to a certain extent survive when binned in @xmath8 .",
    "this can be expected also on the base of dynamical transport calculations that include the strong @xmath16 increase at hadronic energy densities @xcite . regarding the baryon / anti - baryon pattern of @xmath54 , we have shown in the present paper that both a partonic and a hadronic picture show the same baryon/ anti - baryon pattern .",
    "therefore we can say that also employing a core - corona picture the issue raised might persist unless strong transverse gradients within the core , a la @xcite , are maintained .",
    "it is therefore difficult to see whether either a hybrid analysis of a urqmd - only analysis can accommodate the difference between @xmath153 and @xmath111 as well as the near - overlap of @xmath54 seen in @xcite .",
    "this near - overlap has not , however , as yet been established for separate particle species , so perhaps baryonic @xmath0 is quantitatively different from @xmath154-dominated total @xmath0 . in this case , hydrodynamic evolution with a long hadronic afterburner @xcite might be the simplest explanation of elliptic flow systematics .    in conclusion , we used quark coalescence and a simple parametrization of a quark fireball with hydrodynamic flow to investigate the dependence of coalescence - type scaling at various energies .",
    "we concluded that it is wrong to expect coalescence to give the naive quark number scaling of @xmath0 at all energies and system sizes _ even if partonic hydrodynamics and coalescence actually occur_. we have also found that both coalescence and hadronic dynamics predict the opposite difference of baryon and anti - baryon @xmath0 w.r.t .",
    "experimental data .",
    "the scaling of baryonic @xmath0 , therefore , points to the existence of separate quark and antiquark flow at lower energies",
    ". a theoretical explanation of this will be essential to link flow dynamics in heavy ion collisions to the deconfinement phase transition and this is presently missing .",

    "<S> we examine whether the breakdown in elliptic flow quark number scaling observed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energy scan is related to the turning off of deconfinement by testing the hypothesis that hydrodynamics and parton coalescence always apply , but are obscured , at lower energies , by variations in the widths of quark and anti - quark rapidity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling in elliptic flow . </S>",
    "<S> a lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the absence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence . in a coalescing partonic fluid , however , elliptic flow of anti - baryons should be greater than that of baryons , since anti - baryons contain a greater admixture of partons from the highly flowing mid - rapidity region . intriguingly , purely hadronic dynamics has a similar dependence of baryon - anti - baryons elliptic flow as purely partonic dynamics , again because anti - baryons tend to come from regions where the deviation of the system from hydrodynamic behavior is at its smallest . the opposite trend </S>",
    "<S> observed in experiment is therefore an indication that we might be misunderstanding the origin of elliptic flow . </S>",
    "<S> we finish by discussing possible explanations of this , and suggest experimental measurements capable of clarifying the situation .    -0.8cm= </S>",
