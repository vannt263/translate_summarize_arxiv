    "cooperative behavior often provides a strong benefit for populations . but why are cooperators not undermined by non - cooperative individuals which take the benefit but save the costs for its provision  @xcite ? for higher developed organisms , there are several ways to escape this _ dilemma of cooperation _ : for individuals , which are capable to recognize other individuals , memorizing previous interactions and controlling their handling accordingly , reciprocity , and punishment can promote cooperation  @xcite .",
    "however , those mechanisms can not act in organisms of modest complexity like microbes or during the early course of life where memory and recognition were mostly lacking .    in such scenarios ,",
    "cooperation might prevail due to the structure of the population  @xcite ; this idea has been studied both theoretically and experimentally in the context of kin- , group- and multilevel selection  @xcite .",
    "if cooperators more likely interact with other cooperators ( positive assortment ) , they keep most of their benefit for themselves and are less exploited by non - cooperators .",
    "however , due to the costs of cooperation , a fitness disadvantage compared to non - cooperators is still present : positive assortment supports cooperation but is not necessarily sufficient to ensure its maintenance .",
    "crucially , positive assortment can only act if cooperation is already established in the population such that cooperative individuals can successfully assort .",
    "thus , the question remains how cooperation can emerge _ starting with a single cooperating mutant_.    in this manuscript , we address this issue for a generic situation of microbial populations .",
    "cooperative microbes typically produce public goods whose synthesis is metabolically costly  @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the proteobacteria _ pseudomonas aeruginosa _ and siderophore production : when iron is lacking in the environment , cooperative strains produce iron - scavenging molecules ( siderophores )  @xcite .",
    "released into the environment these molecules can efficiently bind single iron molecules and the resulting complex can then be taken up by surrounding bacteria .",
    "microbial populations are highly structured : several colonies form one population  @xcite .",
    "new colonies arise due to migration into new habitats or more actively due to controlled life - cycles triggered by environmental factors .",
    "for example , studies of _ p. aeruginosa _",
    "@xcite confirm that typical life - cycles pass through different steps with regularly occurring dispersal events ensued by the formation of new colonies . as the initial colony sizes are typically small , such dispersal events coincide with population bottlenecks .",
    "emulating the dynamical colony formation , microbial cooperation has been studied experimentally by employing a life - cycle where new colonies are regularly formed from old ones  @xcite .",
    "these experiments and theoretical work  @xcite show that such a restructuring mechanism can cause an increase in the level of cooperation .    based on these observations ,",
    "we here theoretically investigate if such a restructuring scenario can not only maintain cooperation , but also allows for the evolution of cooperation from a single mutant . assuming a constant population size , the onset of traits from a single mutant and its fixation",
    "have been studied in the frameworks of population genetics and evolutionary game theory  @xcite .",
    "however the consequences of ecological factors such as population growth and population restructuring remain unclear  @xcite . to tackle this question for the microbial scenario introduced before , we consider a life - cycle model , consisting of three steps  @xcite ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] :     and free - riders [ red ] in an initially well - mixed population are randomly subdivided into groups of average size @xmath4 .",
    "the groups then evolve separately following two main rules .",
    "first , groups with a higher fraction of cooperators grow faster as more public good is present in those populations .",
    "second , in each group cooperators reproduce slower as free - riders as they do not have to provide the public good ; for detail see main text .",
    "after a certain time @xmath5 all groups are merged and the cycle restarts . ]",
    "\\(i ) in the _ group - formation step _ , a population consisting of cooperators ( @xmath6 ) and non - cooperating _ free - riders _ ( @xmath7 ) is randomly assorted into different groups ( colonies ) .",
    "( ii ) in the ensuing _ group - evolution step _ , each group evolves separately according to generic growth laws of microbes .",
    "( iii ) in the _ group - merging step _",
    ", colonies are merged to one population again .",
    "consecutively , the cycle starts anew with the next group - formation step .",
    "the synchronous reformation of groups via merging all individuals into a single population follows recent experiments  @xcite and is obviously a simplification of natural colony formation .",
    "however , it captures the essence of regular occurring bottlenecks , namely rearranging colonies which have an initially small population size .",
    "furthermore , as it comprises a worst - case scenario for cooperation , it is suited to study the possible onset of cooperation in microbial populations starting with a single cooperative mutant .",
    "starting with a well - mixed population with a fraction @xmath8 of cooperators , @xmath9 groups ( colonies ) are formed during the group - formation step .",
    "successively , each group @xmath10 is assigned @xmath11 randomly chosen individuals of the well - mixed population ; group sizes @xmath12 are poisson - distributed with mean @xmath4 .",
    "the random assortment leads to a statistical variation in the initial fraction of cooperators , @xmath13 . approximately , it is of the order @xmath14 .",
    "we investigate this unbiased random assortment of groups as it does not assume individuals to be distinguishable by the sorting mechanism and again constitutes a worst - case scenario for cooperators .",
    "after assortment into groups , each group @xmath10 evolves and grows separately . the dynamics within groups is given by a stochastic process based on birth and death events which are characterized by the corresponding per capita birth rates @xmath15 and death rates @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the trait of the individual in group @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the birth rates of individuals depend on two factors , namely the trait of the individual and the composition of the colony the individual is living in .",
    "first , cooperators reproduce slower than free - riders in each colony as they have metabolic costs due to the production of the public good , @xmath18 .",
    "second , as more cooperative groups produce more public good , individuals in colonies containing a higher fraction of cooperators are better off , @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the death rates incorporate the effect of limited resources and , therefore , increase with an increasing population size , @xmath21 for @xmath22 . for specificity , we assume the following birth and death rates which fulfill all conditions stated above :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the kronecker delta defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 . while @xmath27 sets the growth advantage of cooperators on the colony level , the parameter @xmath28 measures the metabolic costs of cooperation . the growth rate @xmath29 is assumed to be fixed setting the time - scale of growth .",
    "the here assumed functional form of the growth rates reproduces the generically observed growth dynamics of microbial populations  @xcite : small colonies grow exponentially and their size is bounded by a maximal colony size which here scales with @xmath30 .",
    "a more detailed description of the dynamics including a discussion of the deterministic equations can be found in refs .",
    "furthermore , in  @xcite the specific form of the rates   is justified by successful comparisons with experiments by chuang et al .",
    "note also that the qualitative results presented in this manuscript do not depend on the specific functional forms of the growth rates , but only on the rather generic conditions of population bottlenecks followed by growth .",
    "after a _ regrouping time _ @xmath5 the separated groups are merged again into one well - mixed population with a then changed global population size @xmath31 , and a fraction of cooperators which is given by the weighted average , @xmath32 the cycle then starts anew with the new fraction of cooperators , @xmath33 .",
    "although the fraction of cooperators within each group is expected to decrease during group - evolution , an increase in the global fraction of cooperators is possible in principle : the disadvantage of cooperation within each group can be overcome by changing weights , @xmath34 , in the total population . to achieve this",
    "there must be a sufficiently high positive correlation between group size and cooperator fraction  @xcite .",
    "such an increase of cooperation is an example of simpson s paradox  @xcite .    for the random assortment of groups considered here , two mechanisms promoting cooperation",
    "can be distinguished as previously studied  @xcite .",
    "first , for very small population bottlenecks , purely cooperative colonies might be formed where there is no conflict with free - riders ( _ group - fixation mechanism _ ) .",
    "second , more cooperative groups grow comparably fast and thereby compensate for the selection advantage of free - riders ( _ group - growth mechanism _ ) . as those mechanisms are crucial for the understanding of our results concerning single mutants spreading in the population , we first repeat some arguments from ref .",
    "@xcite and additionally introduce analytic calculations and a study of the key parameters to support them .",
    "the second part of this article is devoted to the main question of the paper namely whether a single cooperative mutant which can not rely on benefits provided by other cooperators has the chance to spread in the population .",
    "in the following we analyze both mechanisms in detail , starting with the group - fixation mechanism . for long separate evolution of groups , @xmath35 ,",
    "all groups reach a stationary state : they consist of either cooperators or free - riders only with a group sizes of @xmath36 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the global fraction of cooperators is then    @xmath37    @xmath38 denotes the probability for a group to consist of only cooperators after assortment . in first order ,",
    "only initially purely cooperative groups contribute to @xmath38 while all mixed groups are taken over by free - riders , such that @xmath39 if @xmath40 exceeds the initial fraction of cooperators , @xmath8 , the group - fixation mechanism is strong enough to overcome the advantage of free - riders .",
    "as @xmath38 increases with the initial fraction of cooperators , there is an unstable fixed point @xmath41 , implicitly defined by @xmath42 in eq .  :",
    "for initial fractions , @xmath8 , above @xmath41 , a purely cooperative population is reached after several regrouping events .",
    "in contrast , when starting below , @xmath43 , cooperators become extinct in the population . this bistable behavior",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] where depending on the initial value @xmath8 the global fraction of cooperators is shown after a large regrouping time @xmath44 .",
    "in contrast to the group - fixation mechanism , the group - growth mechanism acts for small times , where groups strongly grow . as cooperation enhances the growth speed of colonies , more cooperative groups have a larger weight in the average   even though @xmath45 holds in each group .",
    "depending on the parameters , this positive effect is able to compensate for the selection disadvantage of cooperators .",
    "this can be quantified performing a van kampen expansion of the master equation , see supplementary information .",
    "for binomial distributed groups , the change in the fraction of cooperators at time @xmath46 is given by , @xmath47x(1-x ) \\ , .\\ ] ] the first term accounts for the selection advantage of free - riders for the growth advantage of more cooperative groups while the second one reflects the growth advantage of more cooperative groups .",
    "the initial change , @xmath48 , is larger if @xmath8 is small meaning that higher selection disadvantages can be overcome . under regrouping after time @xmath5 , the group - growth mechanisms results in a stable fixed point @xmath49 . as the group - growth mechanisms relies only on variance in group composition , but not on the existence of purely cooperative groups , it acts for much stronger population bottlenecks , @xmath4 , than the group - fixation mechanism does .",
    "however , as it is caused by population growth it can only act for short regrouping times @xmath5 .",
    "repeated regrouping corresponds to an iterative map .",
    "the underlying dynamics ( group formation and group evolution ) result in an effective drift : @xmath50 .",
    "depending on the strength of both mechanisms , and thus @xmath4 and @xmath5 , five distinct fixed point scenarios can be distinguished ; examples for the corresponding stability plots ( @xmath51 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] . besides the discussed _",
    "bistable _ [ only group - fixation ] and _ stable coexistence scenario _ [ only group - growth ] , there can be a _",
    "bistable coexistence scenario _ [ group - growth and fixation mechanism ] .",
    "in addition , there are the _ scenarios of only cooperation _ and _ only defection _ , where the sole stable fixed points are @xmath52 or @xmath53 , respectively .     and",
    "@xmath5 five different scenarios with different fixed point behaviors arise . for each scenario , we show an exemplary drift diagram on the right , where the change in the fraction of cooperators after one life - cycle is shown depending on the initial fraction of cooperators , @xmath54 .",
    "dots correspond to simulation results of the transition points and the lines are guides to the eye to separate the different scenarios : pure cooperation with a stable fixed point at 1 , _",
    "i.e. _ for a purely cooperative population ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) , coexistence with a stable fixed point at @xmath57 ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , bistability with an unstable fixed point at @xmath57 ( @xmath60 , @xmath44 ) , bistable coexistence where both an stable and an unstable fixed point are present ( @xmath55 , @xmath61 ) and only free - riders .",
    "the black square corresponds to the parameters studied in fig .",
    "[ fig : traj ] ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "other parameters are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ]    to this point we have seen that the internal dynamics on the intra - group level result in an effective drift for the iterative map , which can support cooperation .",
    "we now want to examine whether this drift allows for the evolution of cooperation . in other words , we investigate if a single cooperative mutant can survive and spread in a free - riding population . in fig .",
    "[ fig : traj ] we show two exemplary trajectories for the time evolution of the fraction of cooperators . the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath60 corresponds to the coexistence regime in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ( black square ) .",
    "the simulations are performed by placing a single cooperative mutant in one of the @xmath67 groups ; this corresponds to an average initial fraction of cooperators of @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : traj ]  * a * , a coexistence trajectory is shown while in fig .",
    "[ fig : traj ] * b * cooperators go extinct at the fifth regrouping event ( @xmath69 )",
    ". there are strong differences between these trajectories and the ones known from non - linear dynamics models without an iterative map which are commonly used to analyze coexistence scenarios : due to the dynamics during group - evolution , the fraction of cooperators does not only fluctuate slightly at the fixed point , but oscillates around it .",
    "the reason is the interplay of the group - growth mechanism with the ensuing decline in the fraction of cooperators due to the selection disadvantage of cooperators in each group : after each regrouping event , the group growth mechanism causes an increase in the level of cooperators .",
    "later on , when population growth slows down as groups are already close to their carrying capacity , the group - growth mechanism is not effective anymore .",
    "thus , the fraction of cooperators declines due to their growth disadvantage within each group .",
    "this dynamic pattern is then repeated in each life - cycle causing the oscillatory behavior .",
    "but not only oscillations increase the variability , also demographic fluctuations are particularly strong .",
    "the reason is that small variations in the fraction of cooperators are exponentially amplified during group growth .",
    "therefore , for large times ( @xmath70 in fig .  [",
    "fig : traj ] * a * ) when the steady state is already reached the exact position of the maxima and minima in each life - cycle substantially varies between different regrouping events . in addition , also the regrouping mechanism increases the randomness , _",
    "i.e _ due to the stochastic reformation of groups the fraction of cooperators can change during this process . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : traj ] * a * the first eight regrouping steps are magnified .",
    "for instance during the second ( @xmath71 ) and fourth ( @xmath72 ) regrouping events a substantial drop in the fraction of cooperators is present , while for other regrouping events it is hardly changed .",
    "this analysis already shows , that the question whether a single mutant can survive is much less trivial than suggested by the phase diagram [ fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ] : mutants have to overcome two hampering factors which diminish the positive drift of the iterative map .",
    "first , in each group free - riders are favored over cooperators due to the costs to produce the public goods @xmath28 : during group - evolution , the fraction of cooperators declines in each initially mixed group . thus if group - evolution was not interrupted by the formation of new groups",
    ", cooperators would die out in those mixed groups .",
    "therefore , in all parameter regimes ( including the ones with a stable cooperation fixed point ) the fixation probability of a free - rider is higher than the one of a cooperator during group - evolution .",
    "second , even if cooperators have survived group - evolution , it is not assured that they survive regrouping as this process follows a random distribution . especially for small fractions of cooperators ,",
    "cooperators die out more likely than free - riders during regrouping . taken together ,",
    "it is not obvious whether the advantages of cooperators are sufficient to enable the evolution of cooperation from a single mutant .     and @xmath60 , correspond to a point in the coexistence regime indicated by the black square in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] . in panel",
    "* a * a coexistence trajectory is shown , while panel * b * shows extinction of cooperators . for small times ( zoom in inset panel *",
    "a * , and panel * b * ) cooperators have to survive a highly stochastic process : cooperators start with only one mutant , the population is subject to exponential growth which amplifies fluctuations , and regrouping events add an additional level of stochasticity .",
    "in addition , also for larger times the trajectory oscillates around the fixed point ( for a detailed explanation see main text ) and is therefore prone to extinction .",
    "[ fig : traj ] ]    in the following we study this issue by analyzing the _ fixation probability _ @xmath73 , and the _ survival probability _ @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 denotes the probability that a single cooperative mutant will take over the entire population , whereas @xmath76 is the probability that free - riders have not fixated yet in the population .",
    "both probabilities are time - dependent , but reach quasi - stationary values under repeated regrouping , see supplementary information .",
    "again starting with one cooperator , we performed stochastic simulations of the population dynamics , each realization with @xmath77 regrouping events . in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol_prob ] , the probabilities @xmath74 ( panel * a * ) and @xmath73 ( panel * b * ) depending on @xmath4 are shown for different regrouping times @xmath5 . due to the life - cycle dynamics",
    "the fixation behavior here is more intricate than for standard evolutionary dynamics . in those standard models ,",
    "it is the population size only that determines the weight of fluctuations with respect to the deterministic drift  @xcite . in the limit of large population sizes fluctuations become irrelevant and a stable fixed point is reached with absolute certainty . in contrast , for our life - cycle model , the stability diagram and the deterministic drift themselves depend on the initial population size @xmath4 : cooperators are less favored for higher values of @xmath4 .    , and their fixation probability , @xmath73 , are shown after @xmath78 regrouping events .",
    "interestingly both probabilities are fairly large over a large parameter regime .",
    "different colors correspond to different regrouping times : @xmath79 , @xmath67 , number of realizations @xmath80 .",
    "other parameters : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "black lines are calculated with our analytic approximation , eq .   for @xmath81 ( solid ) and @xmath82 (",
    "]    for small @xmath4 , the regime of pure cooperation with a stable fixed point at @xmath52 is present , cf .",
    "[ fig : phases ] . in accordance with that both fixation and survival probability are equal and fairly large . with increasing initial population sizes @xmath4 the strength of the group - growth mechanism is reduced and we observe a decline in the survival and fixation probabilities .",
    "this decline is faster for larger regrouping times since cooperators stay longer in the evolution step and the thereby created selection disadvantage , @xmath83 , accumulates during the time interval @xmath84 $ ] .",
    "further increasing initial groups sizes cause a steep drop in the fixation probability .",
    "the reason is that upon increasing @xmath4 one is leaving the regime of pure cooperation , cf .",
    "[ fig : phases ] red line .",
    "hence , the fixation probability of cooperators dramatically declines . while the so far discussed fixation probabilities only depend quantitatively on the regrouping time @xmath5 , the survival probabilities are also qualitatively influenced by this parameter . for small @xmath5 ,",
    "the system is in the coexistence regime which implies that cooperators neither fully take over the population nor die out easily .",
    "thus the survival probability shows only a slow decay with @xmath4 in this regime .",
    "in contrast , for larger regrouping times , the dynamics becomes unstable . because the dynamics start with a single cooperative mutant , the group - fixation mechanism is not efficient as it is unlikely that the threshold above which cooperators are favored is reached .",
    "therefore , the survival probability declines rapidly with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "let us finally discuss how the survival probabilities can be understood , based on analytic arguments . to this end ,",
    "we approximate the dynamics by considering the first life - cycle only , _ i.e. _ the first group - evolution steps and the ensuing formation of new colonies .",
    "as most extinction events of cooperators happen at the beginning , this approximation captures the extinction dynamics qualitatively correctly , see supplementary information .",
    "the success of a cooperator crucially depends on the size of the group it is living in . for larger groups it has to compete with more free - riders and its survival chances are diminished .",
    "as the group sizes are poisson - distributed , the probability that a cooperator emerges in a group of size @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 .",
    "the probability that cooperators survive the first regrouping step is the probability that not all @xmath87 newly formed groups are purely free - riding . for a realization with a fraction of @xmath88 cooperators before regrouping , this probability is given by @xmath89 .",
    "taken together this leads to the overall survival probability    @xmath90    where @xmath91 denotes an average over all possible realizations . for large regrouping times",
    ", cooperators die out in all initially mixed groups , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the survival probability simplifies to @xmath94 , which is in perfect agreement with our simulation results ; see fig  [ fig : evol_prob ] ( dashed black line ) . for smaller @xmath5 ,",
    "the group - growth mechanism is dominant , and cooperators also survive in initially mixed groups leading to even higher values of the survival probabilities . for @xmath81 ,",
    "where the group - growth mechanism results in a stable fixed point , we compare the approximation with the simulated survival probabilities and find good agreement ; cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : evol_prob ] ( solid black line ) .    .",
    "in panel * b * the impact of varying selection disadvantages is investigated for @xmath63 and @xmath60 . in panel * c * the survival probability for different values of @xmath27 scaling the growth advantage mediated by the public good is shown . even for small values of @xmath27",
    "the group - growth mechanism is effective and support the onset of cooperation .",
    "if not varied , @xmath60 and @xmath65 .",
    "other parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ fig : robust ] ]    to further support the idea that ecological factors can explain the onset of cooperation , we study the robustness of our findings against changes of the model parameters .",
    "in particular we vary @xmath27 scaling the benefit of the public good , and @xmath28 measuring the metabolic costs due to the production of a public good . in fig .",
    "[ fig : robust ] , we show the survival probabilities for different regrouping times and @xmath60 depending on @xmath28 ( panel * b * ) and @xmath27 ( panel * c * ) . interestingly , already for comparably small values of @xmath27 the positive impact of a public good on the population size notably supports cooperation and thereby increases the survival probability .",
    "in contrast increasing costs @xmath28 decrease the survival chances , but the benefits of cooperation are strong enough to compensate for selection disadvantages of up to 20@xmath95 .",
    "in addition , we also demonstrate that our results do not depend on the assumption that the regrouping time is fixed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : robust ] * a * , survival probabilities are shown for regrouping times exponentially distributed with @xmath96 according to @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "again , the survival probabilities are fairly large and our conclusion that a simple life - cycle supports cooperators strong enough to overcome their selection disadvantages is not changed .",
    "all in all , we therefore conclude that our results are robust against changes in the details of the parameters and model assumptions and thereby constitute a possible mechanisms enabling the onset of cooperation .",
    "in this article , we studied the impact of ecological factors like population growth and population bottlenecks on the evolutionary dynamics of cooperating individuals .",
    "our main findings can be subdivided into two blocks : first we analyzed the evolutionary dynamics acting on cooperators already abundant in a population , second we studied the survival chances of single mutants emerging in a purely non - cooperating environment .    in the first part , we were employing our recently introduced model  @xcite to study how a restructuring mechanism combined with typical growth conditions influences the evolutionary dynamics of public good producing bacteria .",
    "depending on the inoculation size @xmath4 and the regrouping time @xmath5 , regimes of stable cooperation , coexistence between cooperators and free - riders and bistability emerge .",
    "those regimes arise over a broad parameter regime even though the worst case scenarios for cooperators are assumed whenever model assumptions have to be made .",
    "therefore , we believe that the mechanisms still apply in more realistic evolutionary scenarios where for example reassortment is not completely random or public goods are not equally distributed between all individuals  @xcite . other studies focussing on different aspects of the interplay between evolution and ecological factors support our findings : for instance , the impact of exponential growth following bottlenecks in infinite populations was shown to support cooperators  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the competition between groups sharing a bounded global populations size and thereby competing for resources was investigated , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the impact of mutations on the beneficial effects of population growth for groups starting with only one individual was studied .",
    "in addition , also the frequency of ecological disturbance and resource supply plays a crucial role for the resulting level of cooperation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , beneficial effects for cooperators were also found when reassortment is not random but environmental driven  @xcite .",
    "all studies emphasize the important role of ecological factors for understanding cooperation .",
    "in contrast to the mentioned studies , we focussed on a description of bacterial growth , starting with an exponential growth phase reaching a carrying capacity later on .",
    "the different growth regimes ( exponential growth and stationary state ) influence the evolutionary dynamics differently : both related mechanisms ( group - growth and group - fixation ) favor cooperators , but as confirmed by analytic arguments presented above , the strength of the group - growth mechanisms increases with small @xmath8 while the strength of group - fixation mechanism decreases .",
    "therefore , both mechanisms can be associated with two different fixed point scenarios ( stable and unstable ) .",
    "we present a full parameter study of the ensuing regimes of cooperation ( fully cooperative , coexistence , bistability , bistable coexistence and purely free - riding ) for both key parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in the second part of our paper we focussed on the question whether those beneficial mechanisms can also explain the onset of cooperation from a single mutant .",
    "similar questions were extensively studied for evolutionary dynamics without regrouping where the factors influencing fixation probabilities for neutral , beneficial and deleterious mutations were investigated carefully , see e.g.  @xcite",
    ". however , the non - iterative map caused by regrouping makes a new study essential as it alters many aspects of the evolutionary dynamics . here",
    ", we demonstrate that ecological factors increase the survival and fixation probabilities of cooperators substantially . in particular",
    ", the group - growth mechanism allows for the robust establishment of cooperation as it does not rely on a threshold fraction of cooperators to act effectively .",
    "remarkably , the probability for a single mutant to succeed decreases only slowly with increasing @xmath4 , and growth thus allows the onset of cooperation without the requirement of extremely narrow population bottlenecks . due to the robustness against parameter changes and the worst case assumptions employed ,",
    "our model provides a proof of principle that ecological factors might explain the onset of cooperative behavior .",
    "once cooperation is established in a population , more advanced mechanisms , which rely on cooperators already present in a population , like kin discrimination or other active forms of positive assortment , may evolve to further stabilize cooperative behavior , see _ e.g. _  @xcite .",

    "( 4 ) and approximations made for the calculations shown in the main text .",
    "as already described in the main text , the group growth mechanism is a fluctuation driven effect . to describe it",
    ", we perform an omega expansion  @xcite of the master equation ( me ) defined by the birth and death rates eqs .",
    "( 1 ) ( main text ) .",
    "the results obtained in this section hold for a fixed initial group size , where the random assortment only influences the composition but not the number of individual of a colony . in most of our simulations ( all except fig .",
    "s1 ) , we use poisson distributed group sizes and fluctuations in the initial composition of a group are additionally enhanced by variation in group - size , see main text .",
    "this full solution can be calculated by weighting the result for fixed colony sizes by a poisson distribution with mean , @xmath4 .",
    "but as the important parameter dependences are already present when considering only binomial distributed groups and the expression are less lengthy , we focus on this simpler case in the following .",
    "before we start with the calculations , we also want to make another comment .",
    "normally , the condition for successfully performing the omega expansion , is a stable deterministic attractor .",
    "however , here we do not want to analyze the resulting fokker - planck equation in detail , but only use it to determine an estimate of the strength of the group - growth mechanism at @xmath98 ( if the mechanism is not strong enough to overcome the selection pressure at the very beginning , it will also not happen later as fluctuations become smaller with increasing time ) .",
    "therefore , the strict assumption of a stable fixed point can be relaxed , which leads to good results as we demonstrate at the end of this section .",
    "the me describing the evolutionary dynamics is given by , @xmath99p(\\!n_c\\!,\\!n_f\\ ! ) , \\label{eq : me}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the probability to find a group containing @xmath101 cooperators and @xmath102 free - riders .",

    "now , within the van kampen system size expansion , the stochastic variables , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , are substituted by a linear combination of functions describing their rescaled means , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and new stochastic variables , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , accounting for fluctuations , @xmath109 in this expressions fluctuations are already weighted according the well - known square root dependence on the population size  @xcite which scales with the carrying capacity @xmath30 .    employing  eqs .   in eq .   and",
    "expanding the resulting expression in the carrying capacity @xmath30 leads to the mean - field equations for @xmath105 and @xmath106 in order @xmath110 and a fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for @xmath111 in higher orders . as the fpe is lengthy and does not contributed to the understanding of our calculation ,",

    ". they can be calculated by multiplying the fpe with the respective fluctuation variable and integrating over both , @xmath119 with @xmath120 . at time @xmath46 , the means of the fluctuations vanish according to the initial conditions @xmath121 .",

    "as the composition of each group is drawn from a binomial distribution , the variance of this distribution sets the initial condition for the second fluctuation moments , @xmath125 . employing this in eq",

    "hence , cooperators are favored by fluctuations . to compare the strength of this fluctuation driven mechanism with the deterministic selection disadvantage",

    "[ fig : condition ] , we compare this condition to simulation data , for varying @xmath83 and @xmath4 .",
    "we use the cooperation time , the time until the fraction of cooperators drops under its initial value , as a measure .",
    "if the cooperation time is zero , the advantage due to fluctuations is not large enough to overcome the selection disadvantage , while for finite values of the cooperation time , the group - growth mechanism is sufficient to compensate for slower growth of cooperators . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : condition ] , eq .",
    "is in agreement with the position where the cooperation time vanishes .",
    "note that the analytical solution derived before gives a lower bound for the the fluctuation driven enhancement of cooperation : we only take into account the initial fluctuations given by a binomial distribution .",
    "in addition , demographic fluctuations further enhance cooperation , explaining the systematic shift in fig .  s1 .",
    "in fig .  3 in the main text , we show the extinction probabilities after 100 regrouping steps . here , we want to confirm that after this time , already a quasi stationary state is reached . in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_course ] , the time evolution of the survival probability of cooperators is shown for exemplary parameters .",
    "the data clearly shows that , as already mentioned in the body of this paper , the first regrouping steps mainly determine the fate of the population .",
    "if a single cooperative mutant survives those first grouping events , its extinction probability almost vanishes . besides validating that",
    "after @xmath134 regrouping steps already a quasi steady state is reached , the presented data also justifies our analytical approach to estimate survival probabilities based only on the first regrouping event ."
