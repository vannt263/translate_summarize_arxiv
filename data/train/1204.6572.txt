    "in order to describe realistic quantum information processes , quantum errors induced by environmental noise must be taken into account .",
    "this can be accomplished by introducing the notion of quantum channels , that is to say maps on the set of states of the system that are completely positive and trace preserving @xcite . at the same time , one would combat quantum errors to avoid their detrimental effect on quantum information processes . to this end , the method of error correcting codes has been borrowed from classical information theory ( for a comprehensive introduction to the quantum theory of error correcting codes we refer to @xcite ) . the underlying idea is to exploit redundancy , that is to encode information in linear subspaces ( codes ) of the total complex hilbert space in such a way that errors induced by the interaction with the environment can be detected and corrected .",
    "usually a logical qubit ( a two dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath0 ) is encoded into @xmath1 physical qubits ( a @xmath2 dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath3 ) .",
    "this kind of encoding is known as _ block - encoding _ @xmath4 however , there is also the possibility of _ embedding _ a logical qubit into a @xmath5-dimensional quantum physical system , i.e. a _ qudit _ with complex hilbert space @xmath6 .",
    "we refer to this kind of encoding as _ embedding _ or _ qudit - encoding _ @xmath7 where @xmath8 .    for block - coding schemes",
    "a powerful formalism , named stabilizer formalism @xcite , has been developed describing one of the most important classes of quantum codes , namely the quantum version of linear codes in classical coding theory .",
    "the stabilizer formalism can be extended over non binary codes @xcite and can be also useful for describing embedding ( qudit ) codes .",
    "actually , the idea of embedding a qubit into a larger space without resorting to block codes was put forward in gotty - preskill where a qubit was encoded into a bosonic mode ( infinite dimensional complex hilbert space ) just using the stabilizer formalism . later on the possibility of qudit encoding was pointed out in ref .",
    "pirandola by using the same formalism . there ,",
    "being in @xmath9 , the errors were considered as a generalization of pauli operators , representing shift errors ( @xmath10-type ) or phase errors ( @xmath11-type ) or their combination ( @xmath12-type ) . however , in @xcite the proposed code was essentially classical since only @xmath11-type errors were taken into consideration .    in this article",
    "we upgrade such a coding scheme to be fully quantum , thus able to correct @xmath10-type , @xmath11-type and , @xmath12-type errors .",
    "we then test its effectiveness for @xmath13 and @xmath14 on a weyl quantum noisy channel amosov ( an error model characterized by errors of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12-types ) .",
    "we allow for the possibility of considering @xmath10 and @xmath11 errors occurring with both symmetric and asymmetric probabilities .",
    "finally , we compare the performance of such qudit coding schemes to those of the conventional five - qubit stabilizer code @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 $ ] @xcite and seven - qubit stabilizer css ( calderbank - shor - steane ) code @xmath18 \\right ] $ ] @xcite .",
    "we characterize the performances of these codes by means of the entanglement fidelity @xcite , rather than the averaged input - output fidelity used in @xcite .",
    "we show that the use of qudit codes may allow to save space resources while achieving the same performance of block codes .",
    "the layout of the article is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly describe block - encoding and then introduce qudit encoding . special focus is devoted to both pauli groups of @xmath1-qubit vectors and generalized pauli groups of error operators acting on a qudit . in section iii , the weyl noisy quantum channel is discussed together with the entanglement fidelity . in section iv , we study the performance of qudit codes . in section v , for the sake of comparison , we quantify the performance of relevant block codes .",
    "our final remarks appear in section vi .",
    "in this section , we briefly recall the block - encoding error correction schemes in terms of the stabilizer formalism . then , using the same formalism we introduce the qudit - encoding ( embedding qubits into qudits ) scheme . in both cases",
    "we restrict our attention to a single encoded qubit .",
    "a qubit is a two - dimensional quantum system with associated complex hilbert space @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the canonical basis of this space and consider on it the pauli operators @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 defined in terms of the standard pauli operators @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 realizing the @xmath27 algebra ( throughout the paper @xmath28 denotes the imaginary unit of @xmath29 ) .",
    "they are such that @xmath20 are eigenstates of @xmath11 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the pauli operators so defined suffice to describe all possible errors occurring on a single qubit .",
    "together with the identity operator @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 ) they form a multiplicative group if we allow them to be multiplied by @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "we refer to this group as the pauli group @xmath36 .",
    "actually it is a subgroup of the pauli group realized through the standard sigma pauli operators and it coincides with the discrete version of the heisenberg - weyl group .    for @xmath1-qubit errors we",
    "can then consider the pauli group @xmath37 whose elements result from @xmath1-fold direct products ( see also @xcite ) @xmath38the subscripts on the rhs label the qubits @xmath16 , ... , @xmath1 , while @xmath39 , label respectively the operators @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 acting on the @xmath44-th qubit .",
    "furthermore @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath46 , the elements @xmath47 can be rewritten as @xmath48where @xmath49 ... @xmath50 and @xmath51 ... @xmath52 are bit strings of length @xmath53 and,@xmath54observe that the order of the group @xmath55 of @xmath1-qubits errors is @xmath56 .",
    "since the factor @xmath57 in front of an error makes no relevant difference on its action , we can actually assume to work with the quotient group @xmath58 , with the major exception being the determination whether elements commute or anti - commute .",
    "the order of the quotient group is @xmath59 .",
    "then , there is a _ one - to - one _ correspondence between @xmath60 and the @xmath61-dimensional binary vector space @xmath62 whose elements are bit strings of length @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "a vector @xmath64 is denoted @xmath65 , where @xmath49 ... @xmath50 and @xmath51 ... @xmath52 are bit strings of length @xmath1 .",

    "the codewords @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( basis vectors for such code space ) can be found as orthogonal eigenvectors ( corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath78 ) of any of the generators @xmath79 .",
    "the encoding operation then reads @xmath80 in view of the correspondence between the pauli group and the vector space @xmath81 , let @xmath82 be the image of the generators @xmath79 in @xmath62 and let introduce the so called _ parity check matrix _",
    "@xmath83then , for an error @xmath84 , the error syndrome @xmath85 is given by the bit string @xcite @xmath86where @xmath87 .    errors with non - vanishing error syndrome are _",
    "detectable_. they correspond to operators not in @xmath88 and not commuting with those in @xmath88 .",
    "that is , a set of error operators @xmath89 is detectable if @xmath90 , with @xmath91 the centralizer of the subgroup @xmath88 . furthermore , the set of error operators @xmath92 is _ correctable _ if the set given by @xmath93 is in turn detectable @xcite , i.e. @xmath94",
    ".    it would be awfully tedious to identify either detectable errors or sets of correctable errors .",
    "however , the quantum stabilizer formalism allows to simplify such task @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that by means of such formalism it is sufficient to study the effect of the error operators on the generators of the stabilizer and not on the codewords themselves .",
    "actually the syndrome extraction corresponds to measure the stabilizer generators .",
    "finally , we denote by @xmath95 \\right ] $ ]  a quantum stabilizer code @xmath69  with code parameters @xmath1 ( the length ) , @xmath44 ( the dimension ) and @xmath96 ( the distance ) encoding @xmath44-logical qubits into @xmath1-physical qubits and correcting @xmath97-qubit errors ( @xmath98 denotes the largest integer less than @xmath99 ) .",
    "a qudit is a @xmath5-dimensional quantum system with associated complex hilbert space @xmath9 . on this space",
    "we can introduce a generalized version of the pauli operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 considered in the previous subsection .",
    "they can be defined through their action on the canonical basis @xmath100 of @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath101 where `` @xmath102 '' denotes addition of integers modulo @xmath5 and @xmath103 is a primitive @xmath5th root of unity ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 operators so defined are unitary ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) , but not hermitian , and satisfy @xmath107 ( with @xmath108 ) together with the commutation relations @xmath109 it is then possible to consider the pauli group @xmath110 consisting of all operators @xmath111 of the form@xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "similarly to the previous subsection , for errors on a qudit we may refer to the quotient group @xmath114 .",
    "in addition to the reasons stated in the introductory section about passing from block to embedding codes , another motivation is to understand whether or not finite dimensional versions of the shift - resistant quantum codes of ref.@xcite are effective .",
    "hence , following ref .",
    "gotty - preskill , we consider @xmath115 , and introduce a code @xmath116 stabilized by the abelian subgroup @xmath117 generated by @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",
    "the codewords ( basis for @xmath69 ) are eigenstates of @xmath119 and @xmath118 with eigenvalue one .",
    "hence they only contain @xmath120s with values of @xmath44 that are multiples of @xmath121 and that are invariant under a shift by @xmath122 .",
    "they read @xmath123    the encoding operation becomes in this case @xmath124 if the states , undergo an amplitude shift , the value of @xmath44 modulo @xmath121 is determined by measuring the stabilizer generator @xmath119 , and the shift can be corrected by adjusting @xmath44 to the nearest multiple of @xmath121 .",
    "the codewords in the basis of @xmath10 s eigenstates can be found by observing that the eigenstates of @xmath10 and @xmath11 operators are connected by the fourier transform @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "then , it turns out that @xmath127 the codewords , , have the same form of , , but with @xmath121 and @xmath128 interchanged . hence ,",
    "if they undergo a phase shift , the value of @xmath44 modulo @xmath129 is determined by measuring the stabilizer generator @xmath118 , and the shift can be corrected by adjusting @xmath44 to the nearest multiple of @xmath130 .    to understand what is the set of correctable errors according to the condition @xmath131 we have with the help of @xmath132 the phases on the right hand sides are non - trivial only",
    "if @xmath133 therefore , the code @xmath69 can correct all shifts corresponding to these conditions .",
    "they amount to @xmath134 and this is also the number of possible error syndromes .",
    "finally , notice that other families of qudit codes could be constructed by generalizing the pauli operators in a different way , e.g. by making them hermitian .",
    "in this section , we first discuss the weyl quantum channel for qudit states and for qubit states , and then the entanglement fidelity as quantifier of codes performances .",
    "consider a completely positive trace preserving map ( cpt map or quantum channel ) @xmath135 , @xmath136where @xmath137 is the set of positive unit trace linear operators in @xmath9 .",
    "then , @xmath135 is called bistochastic if , @xmath138where @xmath32 ( @xmath139 ) is the identity operator in @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath5-dimensional weyl channel is a bistochastic quantum channel of the following form @xcite , @xmath140where @xmath141 and @xmath142 is an arbitrary probability distribution , thus respecting @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "the unitary weyl operators @xmath145 in ( [ dweyl ] ) are defined as , @xmath146where `` @xmath147 '' , as specified earlier , denotes the addition of integers modulo @xmath5 .",
    "they also satisfy the ( weyl ) commutation relations , i.e. @xmath148 u_{n^{\\prime } % \\text { , } m^{\\prime } } u_{n\\text { , } m}\\text{,}\\]]where @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "notice that @xmath153 may be rewritten as @xmath154 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "therefore in what follows we will consider the @xmath5-dimensional weyl channel acting as @xmath157for @xmath158 we have the most general channel acting on a qubit @xmath159for instance , if we take @xmath160 , the channel @xmath161 becomes the standard symmetric qubit depolarizing channel .    to justify the choice of weyl s error model , we point out that the quantum codes employed here are designed to error - correct arbitrary quantum errors such as @xmath10-errors , @xmath11-errors and combinations of the two ( @xmath162-errors ) .",
    "since the kraus decomposition of the weyl channel is defined in terms of powers of these aforementioned error operators , it certainly constitutes a natural test - bed where quantifying the performance of the selected qudit codes .",
    "such a test - bed turns also out to be very general , with the possibility of encompassing physically relevant scenarios .",
    "hereafter , when we consider the two - dimensional weyl channel , we mean to take into consideration the following channel parametrization @xmath163 with , @xmath164 in this way we have @xmath165 then , we can also consider the possibility of having asymmetric @xmath10 and @xmath11 errors probabilities @xcite .",
