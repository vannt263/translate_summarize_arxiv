    "for instance , accurate asymptotic approximations for solutions of the rayleigh equation have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "then , these results have been generalized to include the @xmath0dimensional case of the rayleigh equation @xcite .",
    "although it has been stated that there are no analytical solutions of the rayleigh equation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , such solutions have been found in @xcite",
    ". however , closed  form analytical solutions of the rayleigh equation in @xmath0 dimensions have not been obtained previously .    in this work",
    "we construct the general closed  form analytical solutions of the rayleigh equation both for an empty and gas  filled hyperspherical bubble . to this end",
    "we use an approach that has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we also take into consideration a surface tension .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give basic equations and describe our approach .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the consideration of an empty hyperspherical bubble . in section 4",
    "we study the case of a gas  filled hyperspherical bubble .",
    "we consider the influence of a surface tension in section 5 . in the last section",
    "we briefly discuss our results .",
    "let us consider the rayleigh equation for an empty hyper ",

    "spherical cavity @xcite @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the radius of the bubble , @xmath4 is the time , @xmath5 is the far  field pressure , @xmath6 is the liquid density , @xmath7 is the number of space dimensions , @xmath8 is the polytropic exponent , @xmath9 is the ambient pressure of the gas in the bubble , @xmath10 is the ambient radius of bubble , @xmath11 is the surface tension . throughout this work we use subscripts to denote derivatives .",
    "we assume that the far  field pressure is constant . in",
    "we also suppose that the gas in the bubble is an ideal and obeys the polytropic law .",
    "let us also remark that we do not consider the case of @xmath12 since in this case eqs .",
    ", contain logarithmic terms and , therefore , are singular .",
    "eqs . , are @xmath0dimensional generalizations of the rayleigh equation for the empty @xcite and gas  filled cavity @xcite correspondingly .",
    "note that eqs .",
    ", were also proposed in @xcite .    it is also worth noting that some analytical solutions of the rayleigh equation for the spherical bubble motion in a non - newtonian liquid were found in @xcite in the form of a quadrature for arbitrary @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
