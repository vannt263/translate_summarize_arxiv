    "an oriented smooth hypersurface @xmath0 is called _ translating soliton _ ( or a _ translator _ for short ) of the mean curvature flow if its mean curvature vector field @xmath1 satisfies @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a fixed unit length vector and @xmath4 stands for the orthogonal projection of @xmath5 onto the normal bundle of the immersion @xmath6 . translating solitons are important in the singularity theory of the mean curvature flow since they often occur as type - ii singularities . on the other hand they also form interesting examples of precise solutions of the flow since the smooth family of immersions @xmath7 , @xmath8 , evolves , up to some tangential diffeomorphisms , by its mean curvature .",
    "if one chooses a smooth unit length normal vector field @xmath9 along @xmath6 , then equation ( [ trans 1 ] ) may be expressed in terms of scalar quantities .",
    "more precisely , equation ( [ trans 1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath10 where here @xmath11 is the _ scalar mean curvature _ of @xmath6 . since equation ( [ trans 1 ] ) is invariant under isometries one may , without loss of generality , always assume that the velocity vector @xmath5 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the standard orthonormal basis of @xmath14 .",

    "there is no weierstra type representation known to exist for translators , like there is for minimal surfaces in @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , although it is believed that there exists an abundance of translators , there are only a very few available examples of complete translating solitons in the euclidean space @xmath19 for instance , any minimal hypersurface of @xmath14 tangent to the translating direction @xmath20 is a translating soliton ( however , in this case @xmath21 implies that the translator actually does not move at all ) .",
    "the euclidean product @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the _ grim reaper _ in @xmath24 represented by the immersion @xmath25 given by @xmath26 gives rise again to a translating soliton .",
    "any translating soliton that up to a rigid motion coincides with @xmath22 will be called a _",
