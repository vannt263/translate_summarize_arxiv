    ", fagundes and menon have recently developed a model - independent analysis of the experimental data on the ratio @xmath0 from @xmath1 scattering in the energy interval 10 gev - 7 tev @xcite .",
    "the empirical parametrization is given by @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , where @xmath9 1 gev@xmath10 , @xmath11 are dimensionless free fit parameters and @xmath12 the asymptotic limit . in order to estimate the uncertainties in extrapolations to higher energies ,",
    "two asymptotic limits have been considered : either @xmath12 = 1/2 ( black - disk limit ) or @xmath12 = 1 ( maximum unitarity ) . beyond consistent data reductions of the experimental information on @xmath13",
    ", the approximate relation has allowed extrapolations of the uncertainty regions in the ratio @xmath14 that may be useful in the determination of the proton - proton total cross - section from proton - air production cross - section in cosmic - ray experiments @xcite .    in this communication ,",
    "this empirical analysis of the @xmath0 data is updated and developed in several aspects . the experimental data from @xmath2 scattering , all the @xmath1 totem data at 7 tev ( four points ) and 8 tev ( one point ) are included in the dataset and the energy cutoff is down to 5 gev .",
    "the description of the change of curvature in @xmath13 demands a novel empirical ansatz for @xmath15 and as explained in what follows , we investigate all the three possible asymptotic scenarios : either the black - disk limit or scenarios above or below that limit .",
    "our main conclusions are : a ) the black - disk does not represent a definitive solution ; b ) the data reductions , using the novel parametrization , favor a scenario below the black - disk , with asymptotic ratio @xmath16 .    after discussing the arguments for investigating the three scenarios , we introduce the new parametrization , discuss the fit procedures and results and then present a summary and our conclusions .",
    "the _ black - disk _ limit represents a standard phenomenological expectation , typical , for example , of eikonal models .",

    "_ we have recently developed an amplitude analysis on the quantities @xmath17 , @xmath18 parameter and @xmath19 , including the totem collaboration results at 7 and 8 tev @xcite . for our purposes , we recall that the parametrization for the total cross section is expressed by @xmath20 and fits to @xmath17 and @xmath18 data from @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering above 5 gev , led to statistically consistent solutions either for @xmath21 ( fixed ) or @xmath22 ( free fit parameter ) . in both cases ,",
    "extension of the parametrization to @xmath19 data ( same @xmath23 value ) allowed to extract the ratio @xmath13 and its asymptotic value @xmath12 . in all cases",
    "investigated , we have obtained @xmath24 within the uncertainties and lowest central value around @xmath25 ( see a summary of the results in @xcite , figure 10 ) .",
    "moreover , we recall that in the publications by the totem collaboration , the authors quote the compete collaboration prediction for @xmath26 @xcite , presenting also their own fit to the @xmath27 data @xcite . as shown in @xcite , from these two results and using the central values of the parameters , one obtains @xmath28 as @xmath29 , suggesting , therefore a scenario below the black disk ( see also this point in @xcite , figure 10 ) .    _ above the black disk . _ as discussed in @xcite , besides the obvious maximum bound allowed by unitarity , namely @xmath30 , the u - matrix unitarization scheme by troshin and tyurin predicts an asymptotic limit beyond the black disk , @xmath31 @xcite . here",
    "we also recall that in a formal context , two well known bounds for the total and inelastic cross - sections read @xcite : @xmath32 therefore , in case of simultaneous saturation of both bounds as @xmath29 , it is possible that @xmath33 , which from unitarity , implies in @xmath34 .",
    "our dataset comprises all the experimental data on the ratio @xmath0 from @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering in the energy interval from 5 gev up to 8 tev ( 41 points , 28 from @xmath1 and 13 from @xmath2 ) @xcite . with this enlarged set ( as compared with that in @xcite ) , preliminary tests led us to change the parametrization used in @xcite by the following suitable empirical ansatz @xmath35 where @xmath36 gev@xmath10 ( the energy cutoff ) , @xmath37 and @xmath23 are free fit parameters and for @xmath12 representing the asymptotic limit , the ratio is given by @xmath38    the data reductions have been performed with the objects of the class tminuit of root framework , with confidence level fixed at 68 % . for tests on the goodness of fit we shall consider the reduced chi squared , @xmath39 , and the corresponding integrated probability , @xmath40 . since the parametrization is non - linear in three parameters , different initial values must be tested in order to check the stability of the result .",
    "we have considered two variants in the fit procedures : either @xmath12 fixed , so as to _ impose _ an asymptotic limit , or @xmath12 as a free fit parameter , in order to _ select _ a possible asymptotic scenario .    _ variant",

    "_ we have developed 5 tests with the three scenarios : ( 1 ) below the black - disk , either @xmath41 ( lowest value we have obtained in @xcite ) or @xmath42 ( the result from the totem and compete parameterizations ) ; ( 2 ) the black disk , @xmath43 ; ( 3 ) above the black - disk , either @xmath44 ( possible  formal \" result ) or @xmath45 ( maximum unitarity ) .",
    "the statistical information on the fit results are given in table [ t1 ] and the comparison with the experimental data in figure [ 1 ] .",
    "as illustration it is also shown the estimation of the ratio @xmath0 from the pierre auger collaboration results for @xmath17 and @xmath46 at 57 tev ( not included in the dataset ) .",

    "_ using as initial values of the parameters the final values obtained in variant 1 and the corresponding values of @xmath12 , the data reductions with four free parameters lead to the selected asymptotic scenario , defined by the final value of @xmath12 . in the 5 cases",
    "investigated the data reductions converged to an unique solution within the uncertainties in the free parameters , with statistical results @xmath39 = 0.791 and @xmath40 = 0.814 , for @xmath47 = 37 dof and the following values of the free parameter : @xmath48 the fit result with the uncertainty region , evaluated through analytical error propagation from the free parameters ( one standard deviation ) , is displayed in figure [ f2 ] . for comparison , we have also included the result and corresponding uncertainty region for the case @xmath43 fixed ( black disk ) and the central values for the cases @xmath42 and @xmath41 ( same as figure [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that , asymptotically and within the uncertainties , our solution is not compatible with the black disk limit and the central values for the cases @xmath49 and @xmath50 neither ( namely scenarios above the black disk ) .",
    "the central values in the cases of @xmath41 and @xmath42 lie within our uncertainty region .",
    "therefore , our unique solution favors a scenario below the black - disk limit and we can infer , also from unitarity : @xmath51",
    "we have introduced a novel suitable analytical parametrization for the ratio @xmath0 and developed two variants as fit procedures to our dataset ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 data at 5 gev @xmath52 8 tev ) . in variant 1 ,",
    "we impose different asymptotic limits by fixing @xmath12 at 0.3 , 0.436 , 0.5 , 0.75 and 1.0 .",
    "all the results are consistent with the experimental data ( table 1 and figure 1 ) .",
    "although the results do not discriminate an asymptotic scenario we can conclude that the black disk limit does not represent a definitive or unique solution . in variant 2 , with @xmath12 as a free parameter",
    ", we have obtained an unique convergent solution , indicating a scenario below the black - disk : @xmath16 . within the uncertainty ,",
    "this asymptotic value is in agreement with the results obtained by fagundes , menon and silva @xcite , the prediction from the parameterizations by the compete and totem collaborations @xcite and also with recent phenomenological analysis by kohara , ferreira and kodama which indicates @xmath12 approximately @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "as we have discussed @xcite , a scenario below the black disk is not in disagreement with the pumplin bound , namely @xmath54 where @xmath55 stands for the soft diffractive processes ( single and double dissociation ) .",
