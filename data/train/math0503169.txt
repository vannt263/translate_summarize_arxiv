    "wishart matrices are a family of matrices studied in the statistics literature since 1928 . besides the gaussian random matrices they constitute the most important random matrix ensemble .",
    "they can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath1 matrix whose entries are independent complex gaussian random variables with mean 0 and complex variance @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is a complex wishart matrix ( of parameter @xmath5 ) .",
    "the fundamental quantities of interest for random matrix ensembles are the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution and the fluctuations around this asymptotics .",
    "whereas the main questions about eigenvalue distributions have been mostly answered decades ago , investigations around fluctuations are more recent and there is currently a lot of interest in this topic , in particular , in connection with the question of universality . in the case of wishart matrices ,",
    "the large @xmath6 limit of the eigenvalue distribution was found in 1967 by marchenko and pastur and is now named after them .",
    "the question of fluctuations was addressed for the first time by jonsson @xcite in 1982 and , much more recently and much more detailed , by cabanal - duvillard @xcite in 2001 .",
    "before we say more about their results let us first describe the general picture . in the following we",
    "will , for better legibility , systematically suppress the index @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) at our random matrices .",
    "it is to be understood that random matrices are @xmath8-matrices and asymptotic statements refer to the limit @xmath9 . for many random matrices @xmath10 the family of random variables @xmath11",
    "becomes asymptotically , as the size @xmath6 of the matrices goes to infinity , gaussian .",
    "the two questions addressed above consist then in understanding the limit of the expectation and of the covariance of these gaussian random variables .",
    "for the latter one would in particular like to diagonalize it .",
    "whereas the expectation ( i.e. , the eigenvalue distribution ) depends on the considered ensemble , the covariance ( i.e. , the fluctuations ) seem to be much more universal .",
    "there are quite large classes of random matrices which show the same fluctuations .",
    "the most important class is the one which is represented by the gaussian random matrices .",
    "its fluctuations are diagonalized by chebyshev polynomials , see johansson @xcite .    in the case of the wishart matrices",
    "@xmath12 , the asymptotic gaussianity of the traces was shown by jonsson ; the explicit form of the covariance , however , was revealed only recently by cabanal - duvillard @xcite .",
    "he found polynomials @xmath13 , which were shown to be shifted chebyshev polynomials , such that the random variables @xmath14 are asymptotically gaussian and independent in the large @xmath6 limit ; that is the polynomials @xmath13 diagonalize asymptotically the covariance .",
    "cabanal - duvillard s approach relies heavily on stochastic calculus . in this paper",
    "we want to give a combinatorial proof of his results which rests on a combinatorial interpretation for the polynomials @xmath15 .",
    "this combinatorial approach allows very canonically an extension of cabanal - duvillard s results to a family of independent wishart matrices , yielding our main result .",
    "* theorem *  _ let @xmath16 be the shifted chebyshev polynomials of the first kind as considered by cabanal - duvillard and let @xmath17 be the orthogonal polynomials of the marchenko - pastur distribution ( which are shifted chebyshev polynomials of the second kind ) .",
    "let @xmath18 be independent wishart matrices and consider in addition to @xmath19 also , for @xmath20 , the collection of random variables @xmath21 , where the wishart matrices which appear must be cyclically alternating , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "these latter traces depend only on the equivalence class of @xmath23 and @xmath24 under cyclic permutation . assuming that we have chosen one representative from each equivalence class , the random variables @xmath25 are asymptotically independent and gaussian .",
    "_    let us remark that , in contrast to one - matrix models , multi - matrix models are very poorly understood and the problem of universality is mostly open for them at the moment .",
    "understanding the fluctuations of the simplest representatives of multi - matrix models is essential for progress in this direction .",
    "whereas our results about the multi - matrix wishart case are new , the corresponding results for the multi - matrix gaussian case were derived by cabanal - duvillard in @xcite . by a small modification of our approach",
    "we can also give a combinatorial re - interpretation and proof in this case ( see the remarks in section 11 ) .",
    "the main motivation for our investigations comes from our belief that the theory of free probability provides the right tools and concepts for attacking questions on fluctuations of random matrices - in particular , for multi - matrix models .",
    "even though  freeness \" will not appear explicitly in this paper , our methods and results are very much related to our investigations around  second order freeness \" in @xcite .",
    "the present paper can , in particular , be seen as a complementary treatment of some of the questions treated in @xcite .    in the rest of this introduction",
    "we want to give some idea of what is involved in the proof of our theorem ; in particular , we would like to outline the relation between special planar diagrams and the question of diagonalizing the covariance of wishart matrices .",
    "let us start with our re - interpretation of cabanal - duvillard s results for the case of one wishart matrix .",
    "our starting point is the paper of mingo - nica @xcite , where a genus expansion in terms of permutations was provided for the cumulants of the random variables @xmath26 .",
    "since cumulants of different orders have different leading contributions in @xmath6 , this has as a direct consequence the asymptotic gaussianity of these traces .",
    "the main problem left is to understand and diagonalize the covariance .",
    "also in @xcite , it was shown that the covariance of the random variables @xmath27 has asymptotically a very nice combinatorial interpretation , namely it is given by counting a class of planar diagrams which were called non - crossing annular permutations .",
    "more precisely , if we denote by @xmath28 the covariance of two random variables @xmath29 and @xmath30 and if @xmath31 is the asymptotic ratio of @xmath7 and @xmath6 for our wishart matrices , we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the set of non - crossing @xmath34-annular permutations , i.e. , permutations on @xmath35 points which connect @xmath36 points on one circle with @xmath37 points on another circle in a planar or non - crossing way . in the above formula we are summing over all non - crossing @xmath34-annular permutations and each block of such",
    "a permutation contributes a multiplicative factor @xmath31 .",
    "( for @xmath38 , which corresponds to wishart matrices with @xmath39 , the above formula just counts the number of elements in @xmath33 . )    in @xcite the cycles of the permutation were shown as blocks in the annulus .",
    "see the figure below .",
    "@xmath40@xmath41    in our context it seems more appropriate to redraw the diagram with the circles side by side as shown .",
    "@xmath42    the limit of @xmath43 is , of course , not diagonal in @xmath36 and @xmath37 because points on each circle are grouped into blocks ( some of which do not even connect to the other circle ) , and this grouping on both sides has no correlation ; so there is no constraint that @xmath36 has to be equal to @xmath37",
    ". however , a quantity which clearly must be the same for both circles is the number of through - blocks , i.e. , blocks which connect both circles .",
    "thus in order to diagonalize the covariance we should go over from the number of points on a circle to the number of through - blocks leaving this circle .    a nice way to achieve this is to cut our diagrams in two parts  one part for each circle as shown .        these diagrams which we call ` non - crossing half - permutations ' are the principal objects of study of this paper .",
    "in this pictorial description @xmath44 corresponds to the sum over non - crossing half - permutations on one circle with @xmath36 points and @xmath26 corresponds to a sum over non - crossing half - permutations on another circle with @xmath37 points .",
    "the limit of @xmath43 corresponds to pairing the half - permutations for @xmath44 with the half - permutations for @xmath26 .",
    "the pairing between two half - permutations is given by glueing them together in all possible planar ways .",
    "we will call what is left in a half - permutation of a through - block after cutting an ` open ' block  as opposed to ` closed ' blocks which live totally on one circle and are thus not affected by the cutting .",
    "a pairing of two half - permutations consists of glueing together their open blocks in all possible planar ways .",
    "this clearly means that both half - permutations must have the same number of open blocks for a non - trivial pairing , and thus our covariance should become diagonal if we go over from the number of points on a circle to the number of open blocks . from this point of view",
    "the polynomials @xmath45 found by cabanal - duvillard should describe @xmath46 open blocks .",
    "if we write @xmath47 as a linear combination of the @xmath48 s as in @xmath49 then the above correspondence @xmath50 suggests that the coefficients @xmath51 are given by summing over all half - permutations with @xmath46 open blocks , each such permutation contributing a factor @xmath31 for each closed block .",
    "( the dependence on @xmath31 reflects the fact that in our original formula every block contributed with a factor @xmath31  now every closed block gives a factor @xmath31 right away , whereas an open block has to be paired with another open block to produce a factor @xmath31 . in the case",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath51 just counts the number of half - permutations on @xmath37 points which have @xmath46 open blocks . ) we will show that the coefficients @xmath51 appearing in the relations for the shifted chebyshev polynomials @xmath48 have indeed this combinatorial meaning .",
    "this will be achieved , in section 8 , by showing that both quantities satisfy the same recurrence relations .",
    "let us also point out that the case @xmath52 is special , because constant terms in the polynomials play no role for the covariance , but have to be fixed by other normalizations . on the combinatorial level",
    "this is reflected by the fact that we only look on non - crossing annular permutations which connect the two circles , thus we always have at least @xmath53 through - blocks ( or open blocks , after cutting ) .",
    "since however , our recursions rely also on @xmath52 , we have to make some separate considerations for @xmath52 at various places .",
    "in particular , we want to point out that the ` right ' definition in our setting for a non - crossing half - permutation on @xmath37 points with zero open block is _ not _ just a non - crossing permutation on @xmath37 points .",
    "see section [ recursion ] for more details on this .    in order to illustrate the above statements",
    "let us here present the pictorial meaning of the equation @xmath54 for the shifted chebyshev polynomials @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath55    our combinatorial interpretation of the diagonalizing polynomials for one wishart matrix opens the way to a similar treatment for a tuple of independent wishart matrices .",
    "covariances of traces of products of such matrices are asymptotically described essentially in the same way as before in terms of non - crossing annular permutations , however , in addition we have to colour the points on the two circles ( one colour for each wishart matrix ) and require that the contributing permutations have to connect only points of the same colour ( i.e. , each cycle of the permutation must be mono - chromatic ) . again",
    "the diagonalization of the covariance is achieved by going over from the number of points on a circle to the number of open blocks .",
    "thus , on first view , one might expect that traces of alternating products in the @xmath48 give rise to a diagonal covariance .",
    "however , this is _ not _ the case .",
    "one has to realize that through - blocks of one colour break the symmetry of the circle for through - blocks of another colour , thus in a sense for each group of through - blocks of the same colour the circle is cut open to a line and instead of circular half - permutations we have to consider linear half - permutations .",
    "thus instead of @xmath48 we have to look for polynomials @xmath56 which satisfy @xmath57 where @xmath58 is now the sum over all linear half - permutations with @xmath46 open blocks , each closed block weighted by a factor @xmath31 .",
    "it turns out that these polynomials are the orthogonal polynomials for the marchenko - pastur distribution ( which are shifted chebyshev polynomials of the second kind ) .",
    "again we prove this , in section 7 , by showing the equality of the corresponding recurrence relations .",
    "the proof that the covariance is diagonalized by traces in alternating products in these polynomials @xmath56 is given in section 9 .",
    "as an illustrative example for these statements consider @xmath59    @xmath60    note that the above argument of symmetry breaking is strictly valid only if each group of the same colour has at least one through - block .",
    "however , a priori one also has to consider diagrams containing mono - chromatic groups without any through - block .",
    "it turns out that , by the centeredness of the @xmath56 , the net contribution of such diagrams cancels out . to make this argument",
    "rigourous constitutes an essential part of the proof of theorem [ mt ] ( see in particular lemma [ lemma18 ] )    finally , we would like to point out that our circular half - permutations are , after a small redrawing , the diagrams used by v. f. r.  jones @xcite ,  5 to create a basis for the irreducible representations of the annular temperly - lieb algebras . in jones s convention the left picture in fig .",
    "3 above would be first inverted in the centre of the circle and then the blocks would be expanded into ` fat graphs ' .        in this paper",
    "we will not have to say more about this relation with the temperly - lieb algebras , but we are taking this as a serious hint that there exists a deeper relation between free probability , random matrices , and subfactors .",
    "we hope to explore this relation further in forthcoming investigations .",
    "however , as a nice application of our developed machinery to operator algebraic questions we show , in section 10 , a connection between wick products and half - permutations that gives a combinatorial formula for the product of two wick products which has a very simple diagrammatic interpretation .",
