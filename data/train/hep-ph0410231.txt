    "the major goal of the next generation collider experiments is to explore the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "a higgs doublet field is responsible for ewsb and gives rise to an elementary higgs boson .",
    "however , the gauge hierarchy problem arises from the fact that the radiative correction to the higgs boson mass has a quadratic divergence , which demands a finely tuned cancellation of order of @xmath3 between the bare mass term and the correction terms .",
    "such a fine tuning problem has motivated a lot of new physics .",
    "a particular class of solutions involves some strong dynamics at the tev scale .",
    "the higgs boson could then be replaced by a condensate due to the new dynamics .",
    "technicolor @xcite , topcolor @xcite , and topcolor assisted technicolor @xcite models are typical examples of this kind .",
    "the recent higgsless models also become strongly coupled at a few tev @xcite where some strong dynamics appears .",
    "one of the new features of these strongly interacting models is the existence of new mesons and baryons bounded by the new interactions . in technicolor models",
    "often singlets and doublets of techni - fermions are proposed .",
    "these techni - fermions can form bound states via the technicolor interactions .",
    "if the normal qcd theory is borrowed and rescaled to the electroweak scale , we would have many techni - mesons and techni - baryons . as in qcd",
    "the neutral pion @xmath4 is very unique because of the anomaly coupling , through which the @xmath4 decays into a pair of photons almost 100% .",
    "therefore , in technicolor models there are also neutral techni - pions that couples to a pair of gauge bosons via the anomaly couplings , in particular the coupling to a pair of photons . in collider experiments , the neutral techni - pion once produced will decay into a pair of photons with a sharp invariant - mass peak , which is a very unique signature for neutral techni - pions . here",
    "we consider two photon collisions at tev scale , which is very unique in probing for some neutral pion - like resonances of some new physics models .",
    "some previous studies of technimesons at photon collisions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in one simple technicolor model , the technicolor straw man model @xcite , the lightest techni - mesons are constructed solely from the lightest techni - fermion doublet @xmath5 , from which isotriplets @xmath6 and isosinglets @xmath7 can be formed . in particular , the neutral @xmath8 and @xmath9 have an anomaly - type coupling to a pair of photons as shown in fig .

    "the anomaly coupling of the techni - pion @xmath8 is the rescaled version of the usual qcd , i.e. , the @xmath4 decay constant is rescaled by the factor @xmath10 , where @xmath11 gev and @xmath12 mev @xcite . in this particular rescaled qcd model , the @xmath8 couples to @xmath2 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 through the anomaly .. ] we will give more details and formulas in the next section .",
    "in the low - scale technicolor model that we consider is a multi - scale technicolor model @xcite .",
    "quark and lepton masses are generated by broken extended technicolor gauge interactions in the walking technicolor model@xcite .",
    "the walking technicolor coupling runs very slowly up to the extended technicolor gauge scale ( a few hundred tev ) by including a large number of techni - fermions .",
    "such a slowly running coupling allows quark and lepton masses as large as a few gev to be generated by the extended technicolor gauge interactions at a few hundred tev scale .",
    "there are two types of techni - fermions that condense at widely separated scales .",
    "the upper scale is set by @xmath11 gev while the low scale is roughly given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of techni - fermion doublets .",
    "the techni - hadrons associated with the low scale are of immediate interests at colliders .",
    "note that the extended technicolor gauge interaction only generates a few gev to the top quark .",
    "the top mass is , however , generated by another so called topcolor interaction @xcite .",
    "the techni - pions will couple to normal quarks and leptons through the extended technicolor gauge interactions .",
    "the couplings are higgs - like however , and so the neutral techni - pion will decay into the heaviest possible fermion pair , e.g. , @xmath17 depending on the mass of the techni - pion .",
    "thus , the decay of the neutral techni - pion in this model also includes @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc .",
