    "the distribution of wealth among individuals within a society was one of the first `` natural laws '' of economics @xcite .",
    "indeed , its study was motivated by the desire to bring the accuracy attributed to natural sciences , namely physics , to economic sciences .",
    "the celebrated pareto law states that the higher end of the wealth distribution follows a power - law @xmath0 with exponent @xmath1 robust in time .",
    "the validity of the pareto law was questioned and re - examined many times but the core message , stating that the tail of the distribution is a power law remains in force .",
    "there are recent investigations , e. g. @xcite , giving reasonable empirical evidence for it .",
    "in fact , it is not so much the functional form itself but its spatial and temporal stability that is intriguing . indeed ,",
    "while the value of the exponent @xmath1 may slightly vary from one society to another , the very fact of the power - law 0.tail in the distribution is valid almost everywhere .",
    "recent investigations suggest that the range of validity of the pareto law may extend as far in the past as to the ancient egypt of the pharaohs @xcite .",
    "the universality of the power - law tail is surely a phenomenon asking for explanation .",
    "recently , there was a lot of effort establishing finally the multiplicative random processes repelled from zero as a mathematical source of the power - law distributions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the killed multiplicative processes as sources of power - laws were studied in @xcite . however , there are plenty of possible ways how the multiplicative random processes of this type come onto scene",
    ". one of the most studied implementations were the generalized lotka - volterra equations @xcite and the analogy with directed polymers in random media @xcite .",
    "both of these schemes are formalized by a kinetic equation describing the exchange of wealth between agents and global redistribution of wealth which plays the role of repelling from zero .",
    "related approaches were subsequently pursued by a number of studies and simulations @xcite .",
    "more recently , empirical studies of the lower end of the wealth axis showed that the distribution of wealth is rather exponential than power - law , while the high - wealth tail still remains power - law @xcite .",
    "this finding was interpreted as a result of a conservation law for total wealth , leading to the robust boltzmann - like exponential distribution , whatever the random wealth exchange be , in full analogy with the energy distribution in a gas of elastically scattering molecules .",
    "this , together with older studies within the same spirit @xcite , lead to the view of economic activity as a scattering process of agents , analogous to inelastically scattering particles @xcite . indeed , the inelasticity is indispensable to explain the power - law tail and it is also reasonable to suppose that the total wealth increases on average .",
    "the numerical simulations performed to date confirm the emergence of power - law tail in agent - scattering processes with great reliability . however , analytic insight is lacking in most of the studies available today .",
    "the main concern of our work is to fill this gap , providing analytical results at least for a simplified model of wealth exchange . to comply with the task we will be guided by existing analytical approaches for models of inelastically scattering particles .",
    "inelastic scattering of particles was studied thoroughly in the context of granular materials @xcite .",
    "the simplest one of the models used is the maxwell model , whose inelastic variant was investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "more realistic models of granular gasses were also introduced @xcite but their full account goes beyond the topic of this work .",
    "the most important conclusion of these studies is that a self - similar solution of the kinetic equations exist , which is not stationary in time , but assumes time - independent form after proper rescaling of the energy .",
    "the tail of the scaling function becomes power - law under certain condition .",
    "the formalism developed for granular gases can be readily adapted for binary wealth exchange of agents .",
    "indeed , within the mean - field version of the maxwell model the particles scatter randomly one with another irrespectively of their positions .",
    "this corresponds to randomly picking pairs of agents for interaction , with no care of the ( possibly complex ) structure of their relationships . in reality",
    "the economic activity goes along links in a complex social network @xcite . indeed , recently there were investigations of the role of network topology in wealth distribution @xcite .",
    "we may consider the present model as an approximation of that network by a complete graph .",
    "the main difference from the mean - field maxwell model is that the energy of the granular gas decreases by dissipation , while the average total wealth of the agents increases due to the economic activity .",
    "the sign of the non - conservation is therefore opposite in the two cases .",
    "while the form of the equations may remain the same , the solution can not be directly continued from one domain to another .",
    "therefore , while the case of dissipation is relatively well understood , new approaches are needed in the case of production .",
    "that is the aim of the present work .",
    "imagine a society of @xmath2 agents , each of which possess certain wealth @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "time - to time the agents interact in essentially instantaneous `` collision '' events , when certain fraction of the wealth can be exchanged .",
    "moreover , we suppose the system is open and the interaction can catalyze an increase of the total wealth of the two interacting agents . indeed , the source of the human wealth lies beyond our society and the ultimate cause is the energy poured to the earth from the sun . nonetheless , the external energy is utilized only through a human activity and we simplify the problem by assuming that the net increase of wealth happens at the very moments of agents interaction .",
    "we also assume that only pairwise interaction occurs .",
    "this may be a very crude assumption , as corporate decisions affect many agents simultaneously .",
    "however , we expect the presence of multilateral interactions does not affect the essential mechanisms in work here .",
    "the dynamics of our model is described as follows . in each time step @xmath5 a pair of agents @xmath6",
    "is chosen randomly .",
    "they interact and exchange wealth according to the symmetric rule @xmath7 all other agents leave their wealth unchanged , @xmath8 for all @xmath9 different from both @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 quantifies the wealth exchanged , while @xmath13 measures the flow of wealth from the outside .",
    "the process is sketched schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering ] .",
    "this rule is similar to those studied in @xcite and simulated numerically in @xcite but we consider it slightly more realistic as it treats the agents in a priori symmetric manner .",
    "it also embraces various sources of wealth non - conservation within a single effective parameter @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , also the formulation based on the similarity with the problem of directed polymers @xcite can be reduced to a rule of the form similar to ( [ eq : wealthexchange ] ) .",
    "therefore , we are studying a representative of a whole class of related models and we expect the analytical results we will present have rather broad relevance .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : wealthexchange ] ) describes a matrix multiplicative stochastic process of vector variable @xmath15 in discrete time @xmath5 .",
    "processes of this type are thoroughly studied e. g. in the context of granular gasses . indeed ,",
    "if the variables @xmath3 are interpreted as energies corresponding to @xmath10-th granular particle , we can map the process to the mean - field limit of the maxwell model of inelastic particles .",
    "however , the energy dissipation conventionally quantified by the restitution coefficient implies now the negative value @xmath16 , contrary to our assumption @xmath13 .",
    "we will see later that this apparently small variation makes big difference in the analytical treatment of the process .    the full information about the process in time @xmath5 is contained in the @xmath2-particle joint probability distribution @xmath17 . however , we can write a kinetic equation involving only one- and two - particle distribution functions @xmath18 \\label{eq : kinetic } \\end{split}\\ ] ] which may be continued to give eventually an infinite hierarchy of equations of bbgky type . as a standard approximation we use the factorization @xmath19 which breaks the hierarchy on the lowest level , neglecting the correlations between the wealth of the agents , induced by the scattering .",
    "in fact , this approximation becomes exact for @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , in thermodynamic limit the one - particle distribution function bears all information .",
    "rescaling the time as @xmath21 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath22 , we obtain for the one - particle distribution function @xmath23 a boltzmann - like kinetic equation @xmath24 which describes exactly the process ( [ eq : wealthexchange ] ) in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "this equation has the same form as the mean - field version for the well - studied maxwell model of inelastically scattering particles @xcite .",
    "the main difference consists in the fact that here the wealth increases , while in inelastic gas the energy decreases .",
    "this seemingly little difference has , however , deep consequences for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) .",
    "note also that within the framework of maxwell model the distributions are expressed in terms of velocities , while our dynamical variables correspond rather to energies of the particles .",
    "note first that the average wealth @xmath25 in the process described by the kinetic equation ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) grows exponentially @xmath26 and therefore eq . ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) has no stationary solution .",
    "however , we may look for a quasi - stationary self - similar solution in the form @xcite @xmath27 using the laplace transform @xmath28 we can write a non - local differential equation for the scaling function in the form @xmath29 a hint about possible solutions can be obtained from a special exactly solvable case @xmath30 .",
    "it can be easily verified @xcite that the function @xmath31 is a solution of ( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) . inverting the laplace transform we obtain the corresponding wealth distribution",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 which has similar form as obtained in previous studies @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the value of @xmath14 is negative , which contradicts our assumption of wealth increase , while for @xmath13 the above idea leading to the function @xmath36 does not work .",
    "therefore , we must look for alternative ways .",
    "the leading idea of our approach is that equation ( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) is nearly local for small values of @xmath14 and @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , we will expand the factors on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) in taylor series in @xmath14 and @xmath37 and perform the limit @xmath38 . as the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath37",
    "quantify the amount of wealth increase and exchange in single trade event , we interpret the latter limit as the limit of continuous trading .",
    "in fact , such limit should involve also a rescaling of time @xmath39 , but because we are interested only in stationary regime , the explicit time dependence does not enter our considerations .",
    "it should be also stressed that an important feature can be inferred from the observation that the system behaves differently for positive and negative @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , it suggests a singularity at the point of precise conservation of wealth , @xmath40 .     for @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( full line ) and @xmath43 ( dashed line ) .",
    "]      the main concern in empirical studies of wealth distribution is about the shape of tails , which assumes power - law form .",
    "the behavior of the distribution @xmath44 for @xmath45 can be deduced from the singularity of the laplace transform @xmath46 at @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we assume the following behavior @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "this type of singularity results in the power - law tail as @xmath50 for @xmath45 .",
    "insertion of ( [ eq : smallxsingilarity ] ) into ( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) leads to a transcendental equation for the exponent @xmath1 @xmath51 the solution of which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eqforalpha ] . obviously , there is always a trivial solution @xmath52 .",
    "the power - law tail is due to another , non - trivial solution , which falls into the desired interval @xmath53 only for certain values of the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath14 .",

    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ; solution in the range @xmath49 exists within the shaded region .",
    "we can also see that fixed value of @xmath1 defines a line in the @xmath37-@xmath14 plane .",
    "we can approach the limit @xmath54 , @xmath55 while keeping @xmath1 constant .",
    "this is to be interpreted as continuous trading , as the amount of wealth exchange and increase in a single trading step is infinitesimally small . making this , the non - local terms in eq .",

    "transform we finally obtain the wealth distribution @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "we can see that the distribution obtained exhibits the desired power - law behavior for large wealth .",
    "moreover , it has a maximum at a finite value of @xmath72 and depression for low wealth values .",
    "the size of the depletion is determined by the exponential term in ( [ eq : distribution ] ) , i. e. by the same value of @xmath1 which determines the power in the power - law .",
    "this corresponds to the idea presented e. g. in ref .",
    "@xcite stating that it is the value of the lower bound for the allowed wealth which determines the value of the exponent . here , however , this result comes purely formally as a result of the analytic computation . in our approach",
    "it is the interplay between wealth increase ( parameter @xmath14 ) and wealth exchange ( parameter @xmath37 ) that dictates the value of the exponent @xmath1 .      expanding the equation ( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) in powers of @xmath14 and @xmath37 it is possible to include systematic corrections to equation ( [ eq : local ] ) and therefore corrections to wealth distribution ( [ eq : distribution ] ) for finite amount of wealth increase and exchange in single trading step .",

    "let us stress again that the solution known for @xmath16 can not be properly continued to the region of @xmath13 , due to the presence of singularity at @xmath40 .",
    "the singularity can be seeen e. g. in the behavior of the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : foralpha ] ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singularity ] .",
    "however , for @xmath63 the formula ( [ eq : distribution ] ) describes the solution of ( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) on both limits @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this implies that the singularity is rather weak , because the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) is continuous in @xmath14 , and only the derivative with respect of @xmath14 has a jump at @xmath40 .",
    "one may speculate about the fate of the singularity if we allowed @xmath14 and @xmath37 not fixed parameters but random processes themselves .",
    "most probably the singularity would vanish but final answer is left for future work .    ) for @xmath63 in the ranges @xmath85 ( full line ) and @xmath16 ( dashed line ) .",
    "note the singularity at @xmath40 which means that we must skip from one of the three solutions of ( [ eq : foralpha ] ) to another one . ]",
    "we formulated a model of wealth production and exchange , where agents randomly interact pairwise . using the analogy with the mean - field version of the maxwell model for inelastic scattering of granular particles we obtain analytical results for the wealth distribution .",
    "the dynamics of the model is governed by a kinetic equation for one - particle distribution function .",
    "we look for self - similar scaling solutions , corresponding to redefining the unit of wealth after each wealth increase .",
    "the form of these solutions is given by a non - local differential equation , exactly soluble only in the practically irrelevant case of net wealth decrease .",
    "therefore we turned to approximation schemes .",
    "first , we looked at the behavior for large wealth .",
    "the tail of the wealth distribution has a power - law form , and its exponent @xmath1 is determined by the interplay between the intensity of the wealth exchange and the amount of wealth produced .",
    "the form line in the @xmath37-@xmath14 plane with fixed @xmath1 is found , depending quadratically on @xmath14 for @xmath54 .",
    "the physically allowed values @xmath49 determine a horn - shaped region in the @xmath37-@xmath14 plane .",
    "the second approximation consisted in taking the limit of continuous trading , meaning small wealth production and small exchange within a single trading operation , while keeping the exponent @xmath1 constant .",
    "here we obtained closed formula for the entire wealth distribution , which has power - law tail as expected and a maximum at certain ( low ) wealth value .",
    "the form of the wealth distribution corresponds to those found in previous studies @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that this general form has one - to - one correspondence between the position @xmath86 of the maximum of the distribution and the value of the exponent .",
    "there are few agents having wealth below @xmath86 .",
    "this suggests that the intuition formalized e. g. in @xcite , that the exponent is `` tuned '' by the low - wealth behavior of the distribution , may be in work quite generally . here",
    ", the free parameters are apparently the wealth production and exchange , but in reality these parameters may be themselves tuned by a mechanism which fixes the position of the maximum of the wealth distribution , i. e. the lowest wealth compatible with survival .    however , there is still open question of the specific values of the exponent , which are quite robust in different societies .",
    "it seems , also on the basis of our results , that it can not be explained by the bare mechanism of economic exchange and some other ingredient , possibly of sociological origin , is required .",
    "i wish to thank paul krapivsky and eli ben - naim for stimulating comments and discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the project no .",
    "202/01/1091 of the grant agency of the czech republic .",
    "let us start with the special value @xmath63 .",
    "here , the equation ( [ eq : foralpha ] ) has an explicit solution in the form      however , the non - local differential equation ( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) still does not yield explicit solution . inverting the expression ( [ eq : epsofbetathreehalfs ] ) we get the following series expansion @xmath88 for general value of @xmath1 the variable @xmath37 is expressed as a series in two small parameters @xmath14 and @xmath89 , which coincide only if @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath90 and the various terms take variable precedence in the order of smallness when @xmath54 , depending on the value of @xmath1 . for the first several coefficients we have @xmath91 starting from the expansion ( [ eq : expansionforbeta ] ) we can convert the first order non - local differential equation ( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) for @xmath46 into infinite - order local differential equation for @xmath44 .",
    "the price to pay for it is that the coefficients in the latter equation contain the moments @xmath92 of the solution itself .",
    "indeed , we can write @xmath93 @xmath94 therefore , we obtain a linear combination of terms of the following form @xmath95 which , after inverse laplace transform , give rise to terms @xmath96\\ ; .\\ ] ]    however , the first two moments are fixed by definition .",
    "indeed , the normalization of the probability distribution fixes the zeroth moment and the fixed average wealth , imposed by the scaling condition ( [ eq : scalingform ] ) fixes the first moment , so that @xmath97 .",
    "this consideration leads to the equations for lowest correction to the solution ( [ eq : distribution ] ) , which are free of unknown higher moments .",
    "generally , the solution can be then expressed in the form of the series in powers of @xmath14 and @xmath98 @xmath99 we assume @xmath100 .",
    "the normalization must be independent of @xmath14 , which can be written as @xmath101 therefore , the lowest term obeys the equation @xmath102 which has the following solution satisfying the normalization ( [ eq : normalizationforalleps ] ) @xmath103 indeed , it coincides with the result of ( [ eq : distribution ] ) .    the next two terms satisfy the following equations @xmath104 which can be easily solved .",
    "we obtain @xmath105 and the constants @xmath106 are fixed by the normalization condition ( [ eq : normalizationforalleps ] ) .",
    "we find explicitly @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function .",
