    "non - commutative geometry has slowly been increasing in importance in physics over the last 20 years and has recently received a strong impetus through work in string theory . an important concept in the non - commutative programme",
    "is that of a `` fuzzy '' space  this is perhaps more correctly described as a finite , non - commuting , matrix approximation to the algebra of functions on a continuous manifold which can reproduce the commutative algebra in the limit of the matrices becoming infinite in size .",
    "it has been suggested that fuzzy spaces could provide a regularisation technique for numerical calculations in quantum field theory which would be an alternative to lattice gauge theory , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the prototypical example of a fuzzy space is the fuzzy two - sphere , @xcite , but there are many more examples , and indeed much of the work on generalised coherent states in quantum mechanics @xcite , when restricted to compact groups , can be related to fuzzy spaces .",
    "the geometry of fuzzy @xmath2 and fuzzy unitary grassmannians has been examined in the literature in some detail @xcite-@xcite .    clearly , from the point of view of a regularisation technique in field theory as well as for the theory of @xmath3-branes in string theory",
    ", it would be desirable to have an explicit construction of the fuzzy sphere @xmath4 in dimensions other than @xmath5 . unfortunately , despite the elegant simplicity of the fuzzy two - sphere @xmath6 , higher dimensional spheres are not so amenable to a fuzzy description . to our knowledge",
    "there is no closed finite matrix approximation to the algebra of functions on a sphere for dimensions greater than two , though the problem was tackled in @xcite and @xcite ( non - commutative spheres in the continuum were analysed in @xcite ) .",
    "it appears that , while one can represent truncated harmonic expansions of functions on spheres by square matrices , the product of two such matrices takes one out of the required space and a projection back into the space of functions is necessary after every multiplication  this renders the product non - associative .",
    "in other words a star product can not be defined on the fuzzy sphere @xmath4 for @xmath7 ( this is related to the fact that , for @xmath8 , @xmath9 can not be obtained as the co - adjoint orbit of a compact group ) .",
    "nevertheless the construction in @xcite does associate a square matrix with the truncation of a harmonic expansion on @xmath9 and so does , in a sense , constitute a fuzzy sphere , even though there is no associative product .",
    "for @xmath10 alternative descriptions are possible , @xcite @xcite .",
    "the construction in @xcite is in terms on @xmath11 and uses the fact that the continuum @xmath12 is an @xmath13 bundle over @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it is designed to be used in a functional integral and the technique was extended to @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xcite .",
    "the method of @xcite would be particularly cumbersome to implement in functional integrals over @xmath15 and @xmath16 , or indeed any odd sphere .",
    "in this paper we generalise the construction in @xcite to fuzzy spheres of any dimension .",
    "the analysis relies on properties of the orthogonal grassmannian , @xmath17 $ ] , which is a co - adjoint orbit of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "this orthogonal grassmannian can also be obtained as the complex quadratic @xmath18 in @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are natural complex co - ordinates , @xcite .",

    ". inn - wigner contraction of to the euclidean group of @xmath22 relates @xmath23 to the co - tangent bundle @xmath24 . in a sense , elaborated on in section 2",
    ", @xmath23 can be thought of as the compactified co - tangent bundle for a non - commutative sphere .",
    "there is a finite dimensional , non - commutative , matrix algebra approximation to the algebra of functions @xmath23 which contains harmonic expansions on @xmath9 ( described in section 3 ) .",
    "while it is still the case that the resulting matrix algebra takes one out of the space of harmonic expansions on @xmath9 upon multiplication ( so one does not have a closed matrix approximation to the algebra of functions on @xmath9 for @xmath25 ) it is nevertheless very easy to suppress unwanted modes in a functional integral over a fuzzy complex quadric , @xmath23 , in a manner which lends itself naturally to numerical computation for field theory on @xmath4 , as described in section 4 .",
    "in this section it is shown how the co - tangent bundle @xmath24 can be deformed to a version related to a non - commutative sphere and compactified to complex quadric , @xmath23 .",
    "the construction starts with cartesian co - ordinates @xmath26 in @xmath22 , where @xmath27 .",

    "the isometry group is @xmath31 with algebra @xmath32=i(\\delta_{bc}l_{ad } + \\delta_{ad}l_{bc } -\\delta_{ac}l_{bd } -\\delta_{bd}l_{ac}),\\ ] ] where @xmath33 ( there is no distinction between upper and lower euclidean indices in @xmath22 , @xmath34 ) .",
    "this can be extended to a representation of the euclidean group , @xmath35 acting on @xmath22 , @xmath36&=&i(\\delta_{bc}l_{ad }   + \\delta_{ad}l_{bc } -\\delta_{ac}l_{bd } -\\delta_{bd}l_{ac})\\\\ \\label{ll } [ l_{ab},x_c]&=&i(\\delta_{bc}x_a-\\delta_{ac}x_b ) \\\\",

    "the algebra will now be deformed , essentially using the inverse of inn - wigner contraction .",
    "let @xmath39 , with @xmath40 real , and replace the commutator ( [ xx ] ) above with @xmath41=-i\\mu^2l_{ab } , \\label{xxl}\\ ] ] leaving the other commutators unchanged .",
    "the euclidean group @xmath35 is thus deformed to @xmath42 @xmath43=i(\\delta_{bc}l_{ad } + \\delta_{ad}l_{bc } -\\delta_{ac}l_{bd } -\\delta_{bd}l_{ac}),\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in terms of the quadratic casimirs",

    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 we see that @xmath50 while it may be tempting to think of @xmath26 in ( [ xxr ] ) as co - ordinates on a fuzzy sphere we must be careful : a general irreducible representation of @xmath42 will decompose into a sum of different irreducible representations of , with different values of @xmath51 , so the right - hand side of ( [ xxr ] ) will not be central .",
    "however @xmath52 _ is _ central in the fundamental spinor representation of @xmath53 . to see this",
    "consider the even and odd cases separately :    * even @xmath1 : choose one chirality of spinor with @xmath54 components .",
    "under @xmath55 this reduces uniquely to the single spinor representation of @xmath56 , which has the same dimension . in this case",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ xxr ] ) is a multiple of the identity . *",
    "odd @xmath1 : in this case the @xmath54 dimensional spinor representation of @xmath53 decomposes into two spinor representations of opposite chirality under @xmath57 , both of dimension @xmath58 .",
    "but the second order casimir @xmath51 has the same value on the two chiralities , it does not distinguish between them , @xcite .",
    "so again the right - hand side of ( [ xxr ] ) is a multiple of the identity .",
    "the fundamental spinor representations of @xmath59 have quadratic casimir @xmath60 for both even and odd @xmath61 , see @xcite for example . for a fundamental spinor representation of @xmath53 equation ( [ xxr ] )",
    "therefore gives @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the identity operator , and we might interpret @xmath64 as the radius of a fuzzy sphere .",
    "however , unlike @xmath6 , the matrix algebra generated by @xmath38 will not close in general even when @xmath52 is central .",
    "also one can not get higher dimensional representations of @xmath4 by taking tensor products .",
    "this reflects the fact that there is no closed finite matrix approximation to @xmath4 for @xmath25 .",
    "let us now investigate the geometry of the space generated by the adjoint action of @xmath53 on a fiducial direction @xmath65 ( the `` north pole '' of @xmath4 ) .",
    "clearly @xmath66=0 $ ] for @xmath67 , so @xmath68 leaves @xmath65 invariant .",
    "also @xmath69 commutes with @xmath65 , since they are just multiples of one another , so the @xmath70 generated by @xmath69 also leaves @xmath38 invariant .",
    "the upshot of this is that the manifold that @xmath71 generates with the action @xmath72 is the orthogonal grassmannian @xmath23 , which has dimension @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath73 these spaces have the following structures :    * @xmath74 ; * @xmath75\\cong s^2\\times s^2 $ ] ( @xmath76 was used in a consideration of fuzzy @xmath77 in @xcite ) ; * @xmath78\\cong cp^3/{\\bf z}_2 $ ] ( this identification is described in @xcite ) ; * @xmath79\\cong su(4)/[s(u(2)\\times u(2))]$ ] ( matrix approximations to this space were described in @xcite ) .    we propose to identify @xmath23 with a compactified co - tangent bundle for a non - commutative sphere .",
    "this reduces to the usual @xmath24 under inn - wigner contraction @xmath80 : this limit performs the dual function of rendering the @xmath81 s in ( [ xxl ] ) commutative while at the same time de - compactifying to the euclidean group @xmath35 .",
    "any unitary irreducible representation @xmath83 of a simple compact lie group is finite dimensional and the extension to its enveloping algebra is a finite dimensional matrix algebra .",
    "this matrix algebra provides a fuzzy approximation to the algebra of functions on the co - adjoint orbit of any lie algebra element in @xmath83 .",

    "being a co - adjoint orbit @xmath23 is a symplectic manifold whose algebra of functions can be approximated by closed finite dimensional matrix algebras .",
    "the harmonic expansion of a function on @xmath23 requires all representations of @xmath42 which contain the trivial representation under @xmath84 .",
    "a spinor representation of @xmath42 never contains a singlet of @xmath84 for either even or odd @xmath1 , so we restrict to vectorial representations .",
    "the representation space of @xmath42 is then the space of rank-@xmath85 tensors , @xmath86 .",
    "irreducible representations can be characterised by their symmetries under interchange of their indices and are traceless in any two indices",
    ". they can be represented by young tableau with @xmath85 boxes which reflect their permutation symmetries .",
    "any tensor that is anti - symmetric in three or more of its indices must vanish when restricted to a representation of @xmath70 and hence can not contribute to the harmonic expansion of functions on @xmath23 .",
    "thus we can restrict our attention to tensors that are anti - symmetric in pairs of indices only . if @xmath86 has @xmath87 pairs of anti - symmetric indices and @xmath88 symmetric indices then the corresponding young tableau is @xmath89 when @xmath42 is restricted to @xmath84 the anti - symmetric pairs all contain singlets of @xmath84 ( when both indices in a pair are @xmath70 indices , for example ) .",
    "also if @xmath85 is even the @xmath88 symmetric indices can contain singlets of @xmath84 , but not when @xmath85 is odd .",
    "thus the harmonic expansion of a function on @xmath23 requires all @xmath42 tensor representations of the form ( [ tableau ] ) with @xmath85 even .",

    "\\label{matrixsize}\\ ] ] the fact that this is a perfect square reflects the fact that the degrees of freedom in a truncated harmonic expansion can be arranged into a square matrix of size @xmath99 .",
    "this can be represented in terms of young tableau by @xmath100 which relates the matrix structure , on the left - hand side , to the harmonic expansion , on the right - hand side .",
    "matrix multiplication then gives a closed associative , but non - commutative , algebra which reproduces the commutative algebra of functions on @xmath23 as @xmath101 . at the level of functions the non - commutative product at finite @xmath102",
    "can be realised as a @xmath103-product for the fuzzy complex quadric , @xmath82 .",
    "there is no closed finite matrix approximation for the truncated algebra of functions on @xmath9 known , except for the special case @xmath5 which was first described in @xcite .",
    "there does exist a matrix approximation to functions on @xmath9 , but in general matrix multiplication does not correspond to the algebra of functions and the latter can only be recovered by projecting back onto a function on @xmath9 after matrix multiplication @xcite .",
    "this results in a non - associative algebra when @xmath25 which , by a slight abuse of language , is nevertheless still referred to as a `` fuzzy '' sphere , @xmath4 .    in the construction",
    "presented here a similar projection can be performed , since the truncated harmonic expansion of a function on @xmath9 is buried in @xmath104 . to see this note that functions on @xmath9 can be expanded in symmetric tensor representations of @xmath31 .",
    "a truncation at level @xmath105 requires using all symmetric tensors of @xmath31 , @xmath106 , with @xmath107 .",

    "we see that the last representation on the right - hand side of ( [ matdecomp ] ) contains all the @xmath31 representations necessary for the harmonic expansion of a function on @xmath9 up to angular momentum @xmath110 .",
    "we can thus obtain the fuzzy sphere @xmath4 by projecting the irreducible representation @xmath111 out from the matrix algebra of @xmath104 in ( [ matdecomp ] ) .",
