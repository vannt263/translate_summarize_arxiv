    "starbursts or episodes of strongly enhanced star formation ( sf ) are considered frequent in gas - rich dwarf galaxies , and are principal evolutionary drivers of such objects .",
    "the frequency of local dwarfs implies numerous less evolved , i.e. gas  rich , probably starbursting dwarfs at higher redshifts , possibly contributing significantly to the star formation rate ( sfr ) density ( see e.g. guzmn et al .",
    "1997 ) . while internal regulation processes were put forward to explain their strong sf activity ( cf .",
    "papaderos et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) , sfdgs were also suggested to be influenced by interaction with their environment .",
    "studies assessing this hypothesis revealed that sfdgs typically reside in regions of lower density of luminous galaxies ( salzer 1989 , telles & terlevich 1995 ) .",
    "interactions with luminous galaxies , given their typically large distances , were therefore not considered a general trigger mechanism for starburst activity in sfdgs .",
    "this scenario was also abandoned in view of comparisons between sfdgs with and without  generally relatively distant  luminous companions ( campos  aguilar & moles 1991 , telles & terlevich 1995 ) .",
    "on the other hand , mixed evidence for differing properties of sfdgs in void , field and cluster environments ( vlchez 1995 , vennik et al .",
    "2000 ) , although controversially discussed , calls for an assessment of alternative environmental factors . in this respect",
    ", it appears interesting that lindner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) attributed the apparent extreme isolation of some distant bcds to the observational bias against faint companions . a significant influence of a low mass companion close to a sfdg appears possible , since the tidal forces it exerts scale only with the first power of its mass , but with the third power of its distance .",
    "an alternative scenario is the triggering and fueling of a starburst by infall of gas  rich companions onto a sfdg ( e.g. hensler et al .",
    "observational results suggest that such yet uncatalogued , optically faint objects , down to extragalactic hi clouds with no optical counterpart , are frequent around sfdgs ( e.g. taylor et al .",
    "1995 , pustilnik et al .",
    "we present a first study of the frequency , properties and possible influence of such companions in the close environment of sfdgs . for",

    "of dwarf galaxies among possible companions",
    "we selected all dwarf hii galaxies from the university of michigan lists iv and v , studied in detail by salzer et al .",
    "as these objects are relatively distant ( mostly @xmath92000kms@xmath1 ) , we included a number of well  observed bcds at smaller distances ( cairs 2000 ) to be less biased against low  luminosity companions .",
    "none of our objects resides in a group or cluster environment . to search for companion objects , we chose the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , one of the deepest online catalogs to date",
    ". its inhomogeneous completeness does not hamper our study , as one still can not extrapolate even beyond a sharp limit ( cf .",
    "section [ comp_bias ] ) .",
    "we searched for extragalactic optical sources with the additional requirement of a known redshift , so that the companions properties and distribution could be studied .",
    "spectrophotometric data from the ned and different literature sources were compiled for both the sample sfdgs and the found companions .",
    "distances were calculated from ned redshifts , using tully ( 1988 ) to correct for virgo cluster infall .",
    "figure [ com_dv ] ( left ) shows that almost all of the companions have low redshift differences ( @xmath10500kms@xmath1 ) to the sample sfdgs .",
    "subsequently , a projected linear separation @xmath2100kpc and a redshift difference corresponding to @xmath3500kms@xmath1 were adopted as companion selection criteria , values below which tidal forces have been estimated to be significant ( campos  aguilar et al .",
    "1993 , pustilnik et al . 2001 ) and for which pairs of normal galaxies and sfdgs show likely signs of interaction .",
    "the rising frequency of companions towards lower redshift differences ( figure [ com_dv ] , right ) is reminiscent of what is observed for binary galaxies ( schneider & salpeter 1992 ) as well as for dwarf companions of normal spiral galaxies ( zaritsky et al .",
    "1997 ; cf . also figure [ com_dv ] left & right for spiral companions of any luminosity ) .",
    "it is hence very likely that the companions we find are physically associated with the sample sfdgs , rather than random encounters .",
    "the independence of @xmath11 on @xmath12 found for spiral companions has been attributed to the dynamic dominance of a massive dm halo ( zaritsky et al .",
    "a similar scenario appears tempting for sfdg companions , if a larger dataset can prove that they also show no correlation of @xmath12 and @xmath11 , as suggested by figure [ com_dv ] ( left ) .",
    "table [ biastab ] ( first row ) shows that the majority ( @xmath1380% ) of the found companions are dwarf galaxies ( m@xmath1418mag ) .",
    "as expected , these are almost solely found for the nearest subsample ( @xmath15kms@xmath1 ) due to their intrinsic faintness . from this closest , i.e. least biased subsample , one obtains a fraction of @xmath1630% of sfdgs with at least one close companion .",
    "we emphasize that this is a lower limit , given the incompleteness of our search catalog .",
    "unfortunately , as both the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function , and the frequency of purely gaseous companions are still poorly constrained , a meaningful extrapolation below this limit does not appear reasonable to date .",
    "the average companion is as blue as the sample sfdgs ( @xmath170.44mag ) , and by 0.72bmag ( median ) brighter than its mother galaxy .",
    "this probably reflects a selection effect , as preferably the brightest companions",
    " nevertheless dwarfs  with active sf are catalogued in the ned .      objects with and without found companions ( isolated and non  isolated ) are partly separable only for the nearest ( @xmath182000kms@xmath1 ) subsample .",
    "these galaxies were compared with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath19h@xmath20 , observables which are available for most of the sample and trace the relative sf activity on respective timescales of @xmath2110@xmath22 and @xmath2110@xmath23yr .",
    "the distributions for the isolated and non  isolated sfdgs of the nearest subsample are shown in figure [ histo ] .",
    "smirnov tests yield high probabilities for equal parent distributions ( @xmath6 : 0.90 , @xmath19h@xmath20 : 0.45 ) , whereas the respective sample means are compatible within the sample standard deviations .",
    "these results can neither prove the hypothesis of purely internal triggering of sf , nor disprove an external influence of close companions , due to the low number statistics and the large intrinsic scatter of the data .",
    "the picture is further blurred by the incompleteness of the companion search , i.e. a poor separation of isolated and non  isolated sample objects .",
    "in addition , the time window to detect a starburst through _ strongly _ changed sf tracers is narrow for sfdgs , @xmath1610@xmath22yr after its onset .",
    "the presence of dwarf companions in the close environment of sfdgs readdresses the question of environmental influences on their sf activity , a scenario which had been abandoned before due to the general lack of luminous companions . to obtain decisive answers ,",
    "large samples and deep search catalogs will be required , as well as advances on the part of theory on interacting dwarf galaxies ."
