    "deutsch - jozsa algorithm@xcite , grover s search algorithm@xcite , quantum fourier transform@xcite and the shor s factorization algorithm@xcite have been implemented by liquid - state nmr .",
    "the unitary operators needed for implementation of these algorithms by nmr , have mostly been realized using spin selective radio frequency ( r.f ) pulses and coupling evolution , utilizing indirect spin - spin(j ) or dipolar couplings among the spins . on the other hand several logic gates and algorithms",
    "have also been implemented using transition selective ( soft ; low power , long duration ) r.f pulses @xcite .",
    "the use of transition selective pulses in quantum information processing is popular for its simplicity of logical operations .",
    "for example , a c@xmath0-not gate in a three qubit system using coupling evolution , requires a series of spin ( qubit ) selective @xmath1 and @xmath2 pulses inter - spaced with j - evolutions on all three qubits , cascading a series of unitary transforms , while the same gate needs a single transition selective @xmath2 pulse@xcite .",
    "conditional phase shift gate is an integral part of many algorithms such as grover s search algorithm and quantum fourier transform(qft)@xcite .",
    "this gate introduces a phase - shift only if a certain condition is fulfilled .",
    "this gate has been realized using j - evolution by earlier workers @xcite . in this work",
    ", we construct conditional phase shift gate using transition selective pulses . as an application",
    "we demonstrate grover s search algorithm and quantum fourier transform in a 3 qubit system by simulations , and grover s search algorithm in a 2 qubit system by experiments , using transition selective pulses .",
    "it may be mentioned that while theoritically the transition selective pulses are attractive since they simplify the logic of an operation , their experimental implementation requires long low power r.f .",
    "pulses which give rise to experimental errors due to relaxation and unwanted evolution under the internal hamiltonian during long pulses @xcite .",
    "however , the transition selective pulse method has yielded experimental results with fidelity comparable to j - evolution method @xcite .",
    "recently , use of transition selective pulses for quadrupolar nuclei of spin 3/2 and 7/2 partially oriented in liquid crystal matrices respectively as 2 and 3 qubit systems has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "transition selective pulses have also been used to demonstrate the use of oriented dipolar coupled ch@xmath3 and @xmath4ch@xmath3 groups as 2 and 3 qubits respectively and work is in progress to use transition selective pulses for quantum information processing in strongly coupled spins @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the j - evolution method is either not applicable or too complex to implement @xcite . in such situations",
    "the use of transition selective pulses method , inspite of its experimental limitations , provides an attractive alternative .",
    "it is conceivable that in future the two methods could be combined in order to increase the efficiency or for finding alternate routes for qip .",
    "the conditional phase shift gate introduces a phase shift only if a predetermined condition is satisfied . in one qubit system ,",
    "the conditional phase shift gate is an unitary transform of the form @xcite ; + @xmath5 the @xmath6 introduces a phase shift if the qubit is in state @xmath7 and @xmath8 introduces a phase shift if the qubit is in state @xmath9 .",
    "however , these two operations are identical within an overall phase , since @xmath10 .",
    "the phase shift gate can be realized experimentally by a rotation of the magnetization vector of a spin-1/2 nucleus ( qubit ) by angle @xmath11 about z - axis ( z - rotation ) .",
    "a @xmath11 angle pulse about z axis has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is pauli s z - matrix .",
    "we note that the phase gate @xmath6 can be achieved using @xmath14 , since ; @xmath15 a @xmath11 angle pulse about z axis can be experimentally realized by a composite pulse of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 means a rotation of magnetization vector by an angle @xmath18 about y - axis .",
    "this pulse sequence in widely known in nmr as a composite z - pulse@xcite .    in a two - qubit system",
    "there are four possible conditional phase shift gates ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "a @xmath20 gate introduces a phase shift of @xmath11 only if both the qubits are @xmath7 , whereas a @xmath21 gate does the same only if first qubit is @xmath7 and second qubit is @xmath9 .",
    "similar logic holds for the other two gates .",
    "the unitary operator corresponding to @xmath20 is @xmath22 this gate has been implemented earlier using j - coupling evolution and spin selective pulses@xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath20 can also be constructed using transition selective z - pulses . for this purpose",
    "we first describe phase rotation of a qubit .",
    "the unitary operator describing a rotation of angle @xmath11 about z axis on the first qubit , when the second qubit is in state @xmath9 has the form @xmath23 this is a transition - selective phase rotation by angle @xmath11 about z - axis .",

    "for example , the c@xmath64 type gates ( eqs.[24]-[26 ] ) require one spin selective and two transition selective pulses .",
    "grover s search algorithm can search ( with high probability ) any state of an n - qubit system in @xmath65 iterations@xcite .",
    "each iteration has two steps , namely ` conditional sign - flip ' and ` inversion about average ' .",
    "these can be implemented by using the conditional phase shift gate .",
    "we demonstrate here the implementation of grover s search algorithm by simulation using transition selective pulses on a 3 qubit system . in a 3-qubit system ,",

    "grover s iteration starts from this point by the application of ` conditional sign - flip ' . in",
    "the ` conditional sign - flip ' step , the state which is being searched is inverted ; that is a phase shift of @xmath73 is introduced in that particular state .",
    "this can be achieved by a conditional phase shift gate with @xmath73 corresponding to that state .",
    "for example , for the search of @xmath74 state , the conditional sign flip is the conditional phase shift gate @xmath75 .",
    "the same logic holds for searches of other states .",
    "the second step of grover s iteration is ` inversion about average ' , in which all the states are inverted about their average amplitude .",
    "the unitary operator ( @xmath76 ) of this step for a 3-qubit system is of the form @xcite @xmath77 this step can be realized by applying a hadamard gate ` @xmath71 ' ( on all qubits ) before and after a conditional phase shift @xmath78 gate , hence @xmath79@xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the @xmath78 gate is required because we started with @xmath80 pseudo - pure state , whereas if one starts with another pseudo - pure state , say @xmath81 , then the corresponding phase shift gate @xmath82 will be required .",
