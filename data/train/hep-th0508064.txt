    "one of the most interesting subjects in string theory has been the conjectured equivalence between string theory on @xmath8 and an @xmath5 @xmath9 super yang - mills theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "though many aspects of this proposed correspondence remain a mystery , we can make much progress by restricting attention to certain sectors , such as operators with large r - charge in the cft , which on the gravity side of the duality correspond to strings in a plane wave background @xcite . in these sectors",
    "it is particularly easy to see how a closed string arises as a chain of `` bits , '' dual to a gauge invariant single - trace operator .",
    "we have also come to understand that there is a rich structure of integrability on both sides of the correspondence . on the cft side , minahan and",
    "zarembo showed that the 1-loop anomalous dimension matrix for single trace scalar operators can be diagonalized using bethe ansatz techniques @xcite ; this work was further extended to the full cft and higher loops in subsequent papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the resulting spectrum has been successfully matched to energies of corresponding semiclassical string states @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , on the @xmath10 side , it has been shown@xcite that the string sigma model on @xmath11 possesses an infinite number of yangian symmetries , suggesting the possibility that the theory might in fact be exactly solvable .",
    "work to demonstrate the integrability of the ads string has continued in @xcite-@xcite , and relations between the integrable structures on both sides have been proposed @xcite . more recent work on integrability and ads / cft includes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "integrability has also been studied in deformations that add fundamental matter into the cft , which correspond to open strings living on a d - brane in @xmath10 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these deformations have been further related to semiclassical open spinning strings @xcite-@xcite . in this note",
    "we consider another nice example of integrability in the open string sector : we consider a probe d7-brane filling all of the ads , which adds a single @xmath0 chiral hypermultiplet of fundamental matter to the cft @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we compute the one loop anomalous dimension matrix and compute its spectrum using bethe ansatz techniques .",
    "this system is particularly natural since the fundamental matter is free to propagate in all four dimensions , thus we avoid some subtleties of the defect in ref . @xcite while at the same time working with a system that more closely resembles qcd .",
    "the d7-brane system is also further away from pure @xmath5 sym in the sense that the conformal symmetry is broken except in the strict large @xmath12 limit , where the d7 brane acts as a probe on the ads .",
    "interestingly , one loop integrability is preserved .",
    "furthermore , we can use this system to study more carefully techniques relating open spin chains to closed spin chains @xcite and how these techniques relate to a traditional string `` doubling trick '' .",
    "the analysis of this system has similarities to the work with the defect cft of ref .",
    "@xcite ; both allow for operators corresponding to open spin chains whose boundaries break the @xmath13 r - symmetry down to a subgroup .",
    "we begin in section 1 with a field theoretic determination of the one - loop anomalous dimension matrix , and demonstrate that it vanishes when acting on our chiral primary operators . in section 2",
    "we then determine the integrable spin chain with the same symmetries as our operators , and demonstrate that our anomalous dimension matrix is one of the complete set of commuting operators for this system .",
    "having demonstrated that our anomalous dimension matrix can be diagonalized using a a bethe ansatz , we then find the bethe ansatz in section 3 , by studying spin chains with single impurities .",
    "our analysis in this section confirms many of the features discovered in the previous paper using the dcft .",
    "@xcite    in section 4 , we move forward with both the open spin chains in the @xmath0 system studied in the previous sections , and the open spin chains in the dcft studied in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that bethe ansaetze for open spin chains can be directly related to closed spin chain bethe ansaetze by a version of the `` doubling trick . ''",
    "we apply this method to our open spin chains , and using the ads / cft correspondence , we then find the related open and closed strings .",
    "our relationships between open strings and closed strings have two interesting features that go beyond a simple doubling trick .",
    "we find that the relation differs from the expected doubling trick by terms of order @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the total angular momentum of the string , or even by terms of order @xmath16 .",
    "this first type of correction is obscured in semiclassical analyses , and reflects the effect of boundary conditions on the energy of an open string .",
    "the second reflects the care that needs to be taken in correctly identifying the appropriate closed string to relate to the open string . in this case",
    "we will find open strings that do not satisfy @xmath17 , but are related by `` doubling '' to closed strings that do .",
    "conclusions and open questions are discussed in section 5 , and an appendix includes field theory conventions .",
    "the field theory we study here is a variation of @xmath18 sym in which we add one @xmath0 hypermultiplet of fundamental matter .",
    "this breaks the supersymmetry down to @xmath0 , and breaks the r - symmetry from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , the conformal symmetry is anomalous at finite @xmath12 , though it is restored in the strict large @xmath12 limit where we will be studying the theory .",
    "the content of this theory is then the content of the @xmath5 theory ( 6 real scalars , 4 weyl fermions , and one gauge boson , all in the adjoint of the gauge group ) , and a hypermultiplet of matter ( an @xmath21 doublet of complex scalars and two weyl fermions , in the fundamental of the gauge group ) @xcite .",
    "the pure @xmath5 action @xmath22 @xmath23 ^ 2\\right\\},\\ ] ] where the @xmath24 are clebsch - gordon matrices translating between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 representations of the r - symmetry group @xmath27 , is supplemented by the additional terms @xmath28",
    "@xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    here , @xmath32 is an @xmath33 doublet of complex fundamental scalars , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are fundamental fermions , @xmath36 is a complex combination of two real adjoint scalars ( charged under the @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 is the doublet of adjoint fermions that transform under @xmath33 , and @xmath39 are clebsch - gordon matrices that translate between the ( 1/2,1/2 ) of @xmath40 and the @xmath25 of @xmath41 . in the appendix there are tables summarizing the charges of all fields , as well as full explanations of our field theory conventions .",
    "we would like to find the anomalous dimension matrix for scalar operators of the type @xmath42 to one loop , and in the strict large @xmath12 limit , this limits us to `` nearest neighbor '' interactions .",
    "interactions between two @xmath43 fields are identical to those encountered in one - loop anomalous dimension matrices in @xmath5 sym because terms involving fundamental matter will always be suppressed by orders of @xmath44 .",
    "boundary interactions between one fundamental and one adjoint scalar should , at this order , always yield one fundamental and one adjoint scalar .",
    "thus , we expect these operators only to mix among themselves .",
    "the matrix should act on a hilbert space @xmath45 and consist of `` nearest neighbor interactions '' .",
    "the interior terms should be exactly the usual @xmath5 sym 1-loop anomalous dimension terms , and these should be supplemented by operators giving interactions between the boundary @xmath46s and the @xmath47s next to them .",
    "the anomalous dimension matrix is calculated using the usual feynman diagram approach @xcite .",
    "we find that if the operator is renormalized to be @xmath48 so that correlation functions with this operator are finite , then the anomalous dimension matrix is @xmath49 where @xmath38 is the uv cutoff .",
    "we thus want to calculate the correlation function @xmath50 at one loop , which will involve corrections to each of the fields propagators as well as nearest - neighbor type terms between two adjacent scalar fields .",
    "in addition to the normal types of fields we have in @xmath5 ,    there are three fundamental field types    we start out with the usual @xmath5 diagrams .",
    "first we have the one - loop correction to the adjoint scalar propagator .",
    "note that the two diagrams involving quartic interactions do nt directly contribute to the anomalous dimension ; they help cancel quadratic divergences in the other diagrams whose presence would indicate a dynamically generated mass term . if we considered contributions away from the strict large - n limit , we would also have diagrams here involving the fundamental matter ; these would not have canceling quadratic divergences , and thus would indicate an anomaly in the conformal symmetry .",
    "we also have the exchange of a gluon , and a four - scalar interaction among four adjoint scalars    these were calculated in @xcite .",
    "from the two ends of the operator we have the one - loop corrections to the fundamental scalar    ( again , the quartic terms do nt directly contribute to the anomalous dimension ) as well as a gluon exchange between a fundamental and an adjoint scalar , and a four - scalar interaction between two fundamentals and two adjoints .",
    "after calculating these feynman diagrams , we find that the anomalous dimension matrix is @xmath51\\ ] ] where the operators acting on the interior of the spin chain are defined , as usual , to be @xmath52 the operators that act on the ends of the spin chain are defined as @xmath53    note that the nearest neighbor terms from the interior of the operator are identical to those calculated in @xcite .      as a check on our anomalous dimension matrix",
    ", we find a chiral primary operator of this type , and show that it has vanishing anomalous dimension ( at least to one - loop ) .",
    "we know that in @xmath5 sym , operators of the type @xmath54 for @xmath55 are cpos- they have maximal charge under one generator of @xmath13 .",
    "equivalently , we want to look for operators of our type with maximal charge . of course ,",
    "since the fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 are uncharged under the @xmath58 , we need to restrict ourselves to adjoint fields charged under the @xmath41 .",
    "for example , suppose we look for an operator with maximal charge under rotations in the @xmath59 plane , so that @xmath60 obtains a positive charge @xmath61 .",
    "the so(6 ) matrix for which this vector has eigenvalue @xmath61 is @xmath62 the corresponding generator for the @xmath25 of @xmath27 can be found by contracting the matrix @xmath63 with the clebsch - gordan matrices @xmath24 : @xmath64 now , this matrix shows that @xmath65 would have charge @xmath66 and @xmath67 would have charge @xmath68 , while @xmath69 would have charge @xmath68 and @xmath70 would have charge @xmath66 .",
    "since @xmath71 is in the same representation of the same @xmath21 as @xmath38 , this tells us that @xmath72 has charge @xmath68 under this rotation .",
    "if we transform the @xmath21 generator @xmath73 into the generator acting on an anti - fundamental object , we find that @xmath74 also has charge @xmath68 .",
    "thus , our cpo with maximal charge under this rotation should be @xmath75 and of course there are infinitely more such cpos .",
    "now , consider our anomalous dimension matrix acting on the operator @xmath76 .",
    "we know that each term acting on the interior of the operator @xmath77 vanishes independently , just as it does for the single trace operator of @xmath5 sym .",
    "the terms @xmath78 and @xmath79 also each vanish independently : @xmath80 and @xmath81 thus , our anomalous dimension matrix does vanish when acting on our cpos , just as it should . from now on we will make the definitions @xmath82 we will use the operator @xmath83 as a reference operator , and study impurities of the types @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 in it . note that if we write the charges associated with @xmath87 , @xmath84 , @xmath36 for an operator as @xmath88 , this reference operator has charges @xmath89 , because the fundamental matter is charged under two @xmath90 subgroups .",
    "we would now like to determine whether or not the anomalous dimension matrix calculated above is one of an infinite number of commuting operators in an integrable system .",
    "these calculations follow closely the procedure used in @xcite , but are spelled out here for convenience .    for closed spin chains ,",
    "minahan and zarembo showed in @xcite that operators composed of closed chains of adjoint scalar fields do have this structure .",
    "they did this by identifying an @xmath13 invariant @xmath91-matrix @xmath92,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 and @xmath94 label the two vector spaces ( spin chain sites ) that the operator acts on , and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are as defined in equation ( [ eq : pik ] ) .",
    "these matrices satisfy the yang - baxter equation @xmath98 we can express this graphically . in figure [ r - matrix ] we show the graphical representation of the @xmath99 matrix , and in figure [ ybeq ] we show the graphical representation of the yang - baxter equation .",
    "we can then define the transfer matrix as the trace of the monodromy matrix , @xmath100 where @xmath101 labels an auxiliary vector space of the same type as the sites in the spin chain .",
    "thus , the monodromy matrix acts on the vector space @xmath102 for a spin chain of length @xmath103 , and the transfer matrix acts on the hilbert space of the spin chain .",
    "if the @xmath91-matrix satisfies the yang - baxter equation ( [ eq : yb ] ) , then the transfer matrices satisfy the relation @xmath104 = 0,\\ ] ] and thus we can expand @xmath105 in @xmath106 to get a complete set of mutually commuting operators and the spin chain is integrable . if one of these operators is interpreted as a hamiltonian , the others then represent more conserved charges .",
    "we show the transfer matrix in figure [ transfer ] and this commutation relation in figure [ commute ] .",
    "the single - trace one - loop anomalous dimension matrix can be written as a linear combination of the conserved charges , so it is integrable .",
    "now , the analogous method for studying spin chains with boundaries was formulated in @xcite , and was applied to the anomalous dimensions of operators in a superconformal field theory with fundamental matter in @xcite .",
    "the technique is to introduce matrices @xmath107 acting on either end of the spin chain in addition to the @xmath99 matrices . in our case",
    ", these matrices will act on a vector space @xmath108 though the action on the boundary @xmath46 will be suppressed in the following equations .",
    "the subscript @xmath101 in @xmath107 labels the copy of @xmath47 that it acts on .",
    "these satisfy the boundary yang - baxter equations ( bybs ) @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a transpose on the @xmath111th vector space , and @xmath112 is a parameter defined by the relation @xmath113 for @xmath114 a scalar function . for our case",
    "we have @xmath115 . in figure",
    "[ k - matrix ] we show a graphical representation of the @xmath116-matrix , and in figure [ byb ] we show the graphical byb that it obeys ( the representations of the @xmath117 are similar ) .",
    "now , we can define a new `` transfer '' matrix @xmath118 that will act on the hilbert space we are trying to study . if both ( [ eq : yb ] ) and ( [ eq : byb ] ) are satisfied , then these are the continuous set of mutually commuting operators needed for an integrable system : @xmath119 = 0.\\ ] ] the new transfer matrix is shown in figure [ trans2 ] , and the new commutation relation is shown in figure [ commute2 ] .",
    "we need to find a matrix @xmath120 that satisfies equation ( [ eq : byb ] ) and preserves the symmetry group @xmath121 . again following the techniques of @xcite",
    ", we make the ansatz @xmath122 remembering that @xmath123 are indices in the @xmath90 and @xmath124 are indices in the @xmath41 .",
    "this is the most general ansatz we can make , using the group theory structure we have .",
    "the byb , written in index form , has four external @xmath13 indices @xmath125 , and each index can be either in the @xmath90 or in the @xmath41 .",
    "it also has two external @xmath21 indices from acting on the boundary degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath126 each case should be considered separately , and may give conditions that the functions @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 need to satisfy .",
    "for the eight cases where one index is in the @xmath90 and the other three are in the @xmath41 , or vice - versa , both sides of the equation vanish and we get no conditions .",
    "the case with all external @xmath13 indices in the @xmath90 is satisfied automatically , as is the case where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are in the @xmath90 and @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the @xmath41 , or the opposite case where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are in the @xmath90 and @xmath130 and @xmath131 are in the @xmath41 .",
    "the cases where @xmath134 , @xmath135 or the opposite @xmath136 , @xmath137 each give us the equations @xmath138 and @xmath139    the cases where @xmath140 , @xmath141 or the opposite @xmath142 , @xmath143 each give us the equations @xmath144 and @xmath145    finally , the case with all external @xmath13 indices in the @xmath41 gives us the two equations @xmath146 and @xmath147    these equations determine the functions @xmath148 ( up to normalization ) to be @xmath149    this means that we have @xmath150    in addition , it can be shown that if @xmath120 satisfies its byb , then @xmath151 satisfies the other byb , so that we have @xmath152    now , if we formed a transfer matrix @xmath153 from these two operators , each of the ends would act on the same representation of @xmath21",
    ". however , our operators have one end in the fundamental , and one in the anti - fundamental .",
    "therefore , we create @xmath154 ( which must also satisfy the byb ) and we use this object in the creation of our transfer matrix : @xmath155 using these objects , we can now expand our transfer matrix , and we find that @xmath156 and @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are as defined in ( [ eq : rdef ] ) .",
    "thus , we find that the anomalous dimension matrix from the previous section can , indeed , be written as a linear combination of these operators @xmath160\\ ] ] and thus that the eigenvalues of this matrix can be found using a bethe ansatz .",
    "having demonstrated that our spin chain is integrable , we now want to find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the anomalous dimension matrix , using the bethe ansatz .",
    "the basic idea is to start with a reference state of maximal charge under one @xmath90 subgroup of @xmath161 , and then change the charges of some of the fields in the operators , creating `` impurities . ''",
    "these impurities form spin waves that have momenta quantized by the bethe ansatz @xmath162 where @xmath163 label the momenta of the spin waves , and @xmath164 is the s - matrix for the scattering of two spin waves .",
    "the general formula for the bethe ansatz for a spin chain with sites in a given representation of a given lie algebra is @xcite @xmath165 here the @xmath166 are parameters characterizing excitations , taking the place of the @xmath167 ; @xmath111 labels the excitation as before , while @xmath168 reflects the fact that the excitation can be associated to any of the simple roots @xmath169 of the algebra .",
    "@xmath170 is the highest weight vector of the representation of the group that lives at each site . for a fundamental at each site",
    ", we will have @xmath171 , the first fundamental weight , which has the inner product with simple roots @xmath172 .",
    "note that the relationship between the spin wave momentum @xmath173 and the new parameter @xmath106 is @xcite @xmath174    in this paper we restrict ourselves to operators with a reference state of maximal charge under one @xmath90 , with spin waves all of the same definite charge under another @xmath90 . in this case",
    "the bethe ansatz for the closed spin chain simplifies to @xcite @xmath175 and the spin - wave s - matrix is @xmath176    we know that the generalization of this bethe ansatz for open spin chains should be @xmath177 where the @xmath178 are possible phases that a spin wave could obtain from reflecting off the boundary .    as was pointed out in @xcite , since we already know the s - matrix from the closed spin chains , all we need to determine are the factors @xmath178 .",
    "furthermore , these can be found by considering states of only a single impurity , since only one impurity interacts with the boundary at a time .",
    "we begin with our reference state , which is @xmath179 if we say that @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 are charges under rotations of the three @xmath90 subgroups corresponding to @xmath87 , @xmath84 , and @xmath36 , then this state has charges @xmath183 this is somewhat unusual for a bethe reference state , which is usually constructed to have charge under only one @xmath90 ; however , it is ( as we discussed earlier ) the operator of this type with maximal charge @xmath180 , and it does have vanishing anomalous dimension .",
    "we now to consider operators where one of the @xmath87 fields in the reference state is replaced with a @xmath36 field spin wave , creating operators of charge @xmath185 ( operators with a @xmath184 impurity act identically ) .",
    "the operators in this sector are of the form @xmath186 and we take a standard bethe ansatz linear combination of these @xmath187 to be our proposed eigenstate . using our operator ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , we find that @xmath188   \\ \\ \\ \\ ( x \\ne 1 , l ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\gamma|z(1)\\rangle & = & \\lambda\\left[4|z(1)\\rangle - 2|z(2)\\rangle\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\gamma|z(l - 1)\\rangle & = & \\lambda\\left[4|z(l)\\rangle - 2|z(l-1)\\rangle\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then use this to calculate @xmath189 notice that for the terms of @xmath190 with @xmath191 , we already have what we want , so that @xmath192 must be the eigenvalue of @xmath190 under operator @xmath193 . in order for the operator to be an eigenstate , we then demand that @xmath194 which gives @xmath195 and @xmath196 which ( together with the above result ) gives @xmath197 this is then our bethe equation for a single impurity of this type . notice that the @xmath36 impurity `` sees '' a spin chain of effective length @xmath198 , and that the boundary terms are trivial : @xmath199 in total , we write that the spin wave momentum is quantized as @xmath200 the eigenstate is written as @xmath201 ( so that the spin wave does , indeed , obey `` dirichlet boundary conditions , '' as one would expect of an impurity that corresponds to a direction perpendicular to the 7-brane ) , and the anomalous dimension of this operator is given by @xmath202      next we consider states with a single impurity of type @xmath84 , so that the states have charge @xmath203 notice that even though these impurities are charged under the @xmath41 under which the boundary terms are charged , this sector does not contain any operators where the boundary fields are `` flipped , '' for example , operators like @xmath204 . therefore , the calculations here are very similar to the previous ones .",

    "we also need @xmath226 which , together with the previous result , yields @xmath227 and @xmath228 this , together with the previous results , yields @xmath229 which is our spin - wave momentum quantization condition for this type of impurity .",
    "again , we have seen that the boundary interaction is trivial : @xmath199 our spin wave momentum is now quantized according to @xmath230 because this type of impurity `` sees '' an effective length of @xmath231 . with the definitions @xmath232 our eigenstates are @xmath233 ( again with neumann boundary conditions for the spin waves ) , and their eigenvalues are @xmath234    there are three results in this section that we would like to highlight .",
    "first , notice that for all three types of impurities , the spin waves reflect trivially off the boundary .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "it is probable that any open spin chains in a cft whose boundary terms are fundamental matter created by the insertion of a simple d - brane into the ads@xmath235s@xmath2 background will behave like this .",
    "these types of open spin chains are related to closed spin chains by simple `` doubling tricks , '' just as the open strings are related to the closed strings .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether any kind of fundamental matter can lead to nontrivial reflection terms and , if so , what kind of string theory solution they correspond to .",
    "second , the spin waves that should correspond to motion of the open string parallel to the d - brane satisfy neumann boundary conditions , while those that correspond to motion perpendicular to the d - brane satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "again , this reinforces the previous results of @xcite as further evidence of the ads / cft correspondence .    finally , consider the effective lengths of the spin chains , as seen from the quantization conditions of the spin - wave momenta . in @xcite , where the r - symmetry was broken to @xmath236 with the boundary terms charged under @xmath237 , dewolfe and mann showed that impurities charged under the @xmath238 `` saw '' an effective length of one unit less than the effective length experienced by @xmath237 impurities .",
    "the authors argued that this was because the impurities in @xmath237 could interact with the boundaries , which then , together , acted like an extra site in the spin chain .",
    "here , the story is clearly more complicated .",
    "we have @xmath36 or @xmath184 impurities experiencing effective length @xmath239 , @xmath84 impurities experiencing effective length @xmath103 , and @xmath85 impurities experiencing effective length @xmath231 .",
    "this effective length matters when we consider the use of equation ( [ eq : bba ] ) in connection with the `` doubling trick , '' in the next section .",
    "in @xcite , chen , wang , and wu showed that open spin chains could be directly related to closed spin chains , and , similarly , open spinning strings could be related to closed spinning strings .",
    "these two relations then were shown to imply that if the closed spin chains and closed spinning strings satisfied the ads / cft correspondence , so did the open spin chains and open spinning strings . here , we apply these arguments to the particular open spin chains being studied in this paper .",
    "consider first an open spin chain with a large number of impurities of type @xmath36 ( or @xmath184 ) .",
    "this spin chain will have charges @xmath240 where @xmath241 and @xmath242 are the number of @xmath87 and @xmath36 fields in the interior of the operator .",
    "this spin chain has roots that satisfy the equation @xmath243 and has anomalous dimension @xmath244 however , equation ( [ eq : rootsz ] ) can be directly related to the equation for a closed spin chain of length @xmath245 with @xmath246 symmetrically distributed roots @xmath247 thus we can relate the two anomalous dimensions as @xmath248    notice that the related closed spin chain carries no evidence of the @xmath249 charge carried by the open chain ; this is an effect that disappears in the thermodynamic limit , but should still somehow be explained on the string side eventually , through d - brane effects .",
    "we can write this relationship in terms of the actual dimension of the operators , which can then be related to the energies of open and closed strings , at least to lowest order in @xmath250 .",
    "doing so gives us @xmath251 and then @xmath252 this gives results that will differ from those in @xcite by terms of order @xmath253 , which vanish in the semi - classical limit .    by similar logic",
    ", we can work out the relation between open spin chains with @xmath84 impurities and a closed spin chain to be @xmath254 which gives the relationship between energies of open and closed strings @xmath255    we can do the same for the open spin chain with @xmath85 impurities and we find the relationship @xmath256 which gives @xmath257 this is a more interesting result than those above , because it differs from the expected doubling relation by terms of order @xmath93 , rather than of order @xmath253 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the impurities carry opposite r - charge from the fundamental matter on the ends of the spin chain",
    ". the closed spin chain that we relate to the open spin chain does not really incorporate the @xmath84 r - charge from the fundamental matter at the ends of the spin chain , so it is a simpler object .",
    "finally , for comparison , we can carry this procedure out on the spin chains studied in @xcite , where the fundamental matter is in a dcft . using impurities that do not interact with the boundaries , ( analogous to our @xmath36 impurities ) ,",
    "we would find the anomalous dimension relation @xmath258 and the energy relation @xmath259 which again differs from the expected result by a term of order @xmath260 .",
    "notice that in all these cases , the anomalous dimension of the open spin chain is directly related to the anomalous dimension of a closed spin chain .",
    "however , the associated closed spin chain is simpler than the open spin chain .",
    "the closed spin chain is determined completely by the impurity spin waves and the effective length that these spin waves `` see '' . however , this does not capture the full charge structure of the open spin chain , and so some information is lost in the relationship .",
    "specifically , the closed spin chain is relatively unaffected by the details of the ends of the open spin chain , even when the length of the spin chain is small .",
    "in this paper we have found one more supersymmetric gauge theory with fundamental scalar matter that has one - loop integrability .",
    "we solved the bethe ansatz and determined the spectrum , confirming that reflections of spin waves off the ends of the spin chain correspond directly to boundary conditions of an open string stuck to a d7-brane .",
    "we also used a `` doubling trick '' to relate open spin chain excitations with anomalous dimension @xmath261 to closed spin chain excitations with anomalous dimension @xmath262 .",
    "however , we found that this doubling trick exhibited unexpected results .",
    "the charges of the closed spin chain were not just `` double '' that of the associated open spin chain .",
    "this is because the closed spin chain is not sensitive to all of the details of the boundaries of the open spin chain , even when the spin chain is short .",
    "the boundary terms interact differently with different types of impurities , but some of this information is lost when relating the open spin chain to the closed spin chain . after applying the ads / cft correspondence to this , we found an implied relationship between the energies of open and closed strings , but because of the above issues , this relationship differed from the expected doubling trick in all cases by terms of order @xmath263 , and in one case by a term of order @xmath16 .",
    "the terms of order @xmath263 represent finite size effects that clearly vanish in the semiclassical approximations that have been studied .",
    "the term of order @xmath16 arises because the closed string state associated with the open string state is not the obvious one .",
    "this suggests that care needs to be exercised in using the doubling trick for open strings and closed strings in the ads@xmath264s@xmath265 , so that the appropriate states are identified .",
    "this work suggests that the boundary conditions of open strings can give corrections to the @xmath250 term in the energies of these open strings of order @xmath266 , ( that is , there is a correction to the energy of the string of order @xmath267 ) .",
    "very little work has been done to separate the quantum corrections to open strings from pure finite size corrections .",
    "it would be interesting to develop techniques to study these types of corrections , in order to verify the relations we found here using the bethe ansatz techniques .",
    "it would also be useful to construct the open string related to our @xmath85-impurity spin chain , and see if we can reproduce the @xmath16 discrepancy in the doubling trick , and better understand it from the string side .",
    "we would like to thank oliver dewolfe , joe polchinski , and david berenstein for many useful and illuminating discussions .",
