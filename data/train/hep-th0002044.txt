    "is there a comparable simple summary of the new principles which our science is now uncovering ?",
    "some people think it is supersymmetry , others think it is duality . but the real world is not supersymmetric , nor is it known to have dual descriptions in any deep sense .",
    "my own view is that the lasting idea will be the _",

    "@xcite@xcite , the assertion that the number of possible states of a region of space is the same as that of a system of binary degrees of freedom distributed on the boundary of the region .",
    "the number of such degrees of freedom is not indefinitely large but is bounded by the area of the region in planck units .",
    "these lectures are about the motivations and evidence for this principle .",
    "the holographic principle grew out of the deep insights of bekenstein @xcite and hawking @xcite in the 70 s .",
    "in particular hawking raised a very profound question concerning the consistency of gravitation and the usual operational principles of quantum mechanics @xcite . to state the paradox",
    "clearly it is useful to think of a black hole as an intermediate state in a scattering process .",
    "particles , perhaps in the form of stars , galaxies or just ordinary quanta come together in an initial state @xmath0 . a black hole forms and evaporates leaving outgoing photons , gravitons neutrinos and other quanta .",
    "no energy is lost in the process so there are no unaccounted for degrees of freedom in the final state . according to the usual rules , such a process is described by a unitary scattering matrix @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 since @xmath1 is unitary we can also write @xmath3 in other words it must be possible to recover the initial quantum state from the final state in a unique way . however , hawking gave arguments , that appeared to many as completely persuasive , that information is irretrievably lost when matter falls behind the horizon of the black hole .",
    "thus , from an operational point of view , the rules of quantum mechanics as set out by dirac would have to be modified as collision energies approach and exceed the planck energy .",

    "there are many kinds of black holes in string theory but we will confine our attention to the usual @xmath4 dimensional schwarzschild case .",

    "although the flat minkowski coordinates only describe the near horizon region , a generalization to kruskal - szekeres ( ks ) coordinates covers the whole black hole space - time . suppressing the angular coordinates @xmath27 the ks metric has the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",

    "in schwarzschild coordinates the particle does not cross the horizon until infinite time has elapsed . thus from the viewpoint of an observer outside the black hole , the particle asymptotically approaches the horizon , but never crosses it .",
    "indeed , all the matter which collapsed to form the black hole never crosses the horizon in finite schwarzschild time .",
    "classically it forms progressively thinner layers which asymptotically approach the horizon .    on the other hand , from the point of view of a freely falling observer accompanying the infalling particle the horizon",
    "is crossed after a finite time .",
    "in fact from figure 3 it is obvious that nothing special happens to the infalling matter at the horizon .",

    "here are the rules for a penrose diagram .",

    "the vertical axis is the spatial origin at @xmath8 and the point labeled @xmath36 represents the asymptotic endpoints of space - like lines .",

    "are unphysical .",
    "region i is the outside of the black hole and like flat minkowski space it has space - like , time - like and null infinities .",
    "obviously future directed time - like or light - like trajectory that begins in region ii will collide with the singularity .",

    "the black hole has formed and the geometry should resemble figure ( 5 ) . thus the penrose diagram for the collapse looks is shown in figure ( 6 ) .    _ black hole thermodynamics _",
    "it is well known that black holes are thermodynamic objects @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "in addition to their energy , @xmath40 they have a temperature and entropy . to understand this we need to study the behavior of quantum fields in the near horizon geometry .",
    "we will see later that quantum field theory can not really be an adequate description of a world including gravity but it is a starting point which will allow us to abstract some important lessons .",
    "as we have seen , the near horizon geometry is just minkowski space described in hyperbolic polar coordinates . in particular the portion of the near horizon region @xmath41 outside the black hole",
    "is called rindler space .",
    "the usual time coordinate of minkowski space is @xmath42 and conjugate to it is the momentum component @xmath43 .",
    "however , @xmath43 is not the energy or hamiltonian appropriate to the study of black holes by distant observers . for such observers",
    "the natural time is the schwarzschild time @xmath44 .",
    "the conjugate hamiltonian which represents the energy or mass of the black hole is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a dimensionless hamiltonian conjugate to the dimensionless rindler time @xmath47 .",
    "an observer outside the horizon has no access to the degrees of freedom behind the horizon .",
    "for this reason all observations can be described in terms of a density matrix @xmath48 obtained by tracing over the degrees of freedom behind the horizon @xcite . to derive the form of the density matrix for external observations we begin with the minkowski space vacuum .",
    "the coordinates of minkowski space are @xmath49 and the horizon coordinates @xmath50 .",
    "the instant of rindler time @xmath51 coincides with the half - surface @xmath52 the other half of the surface @xmath53 is behind the horizon and is to be traced over .",
    "let us consider a set of quantum fields labeled @xmath54 . to specify the field configuration at @xmath55 we need to give the values of @xmath54 on both half - surfaces .",
    "let @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent the field configurations for @xmath58 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "a quantum state is represented by a wave functional @xmath59    we use the standard euclidean feynman path integral formula to compute @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 where the path integral is over all fields in the future half space @xmath62 with boundary condition @xmath63 at @xmath55 .",
    "the trick to compute the density matrix @xmath48 is to divide the upper half plane @xmath62 into infinitesimal angular wedges as in figure ( 7 ) .",
    "the path integral can then be evaluated in terms of a generator of angular rotations .",
    "this generator is nothing but @xmath64 .",
    "thus the expression for the minkowski vacuum is @xmath65 in other words the minkowski vacuum wave functional is a transition amplitude for elapsed euclidean time @xmath66 .    now consider the density matrix given by @xmath67 using eq.(1.19)and the completeness of the states @xmath68 gives @xmath69 or more concisely @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "equation ( 1.22 ) is has the remarkable property of being a thermal density matrix for temperature @xmath72 .",
    "notice that the derivation is exact and in no way relies on the free field approximation .",
    "it is valid for any quantum field theory for any strength of coupling .",
    "the temperature @xmath71 does not have the usual dimensions of energy .",
    "this is because the rindler time and therefore the rindler hamiltonian is dimensionless . to convert to a proper temperature with dimensions of energy we consider the proper time interval corresponding to an interval @xmath73 . from eq.(1.7 ) @xmath74 thus an observer at distance @xmath75 from the horizon converts from dimensionless quantities using the conversion factor @xmath75 .",
    "the proper temperature at distance @xmath75 is given by @xmath76    in this way we arrive at the important conclusion that an observer outside a black hole but in the near horizon region will detect a temperature that varies as the inverse distance from the horizon @xcite .",
    "next consider the temperature as measured by a distant observer asymptotically far from the black hole .",
    "the proper time variable for such an observer is the schwarzschild time @xmath44 .",
    "thus such distant observers measure temperature @xmath77 this is the hawking temperature @xcite of the black hole .",
    "it represents the true thermodynamic temperature of an isolated black hole .",
    "the thermodynamic relation between temperature and mass ( energy ) allow us to compute an entropy for the black hole .",
    "using @xmath78 we find @xmath79 or in terms of the horizon area @xmath80",
    "@xmath81    equation ( 1.28 ) is far more general than the derivation given here .",
    "it applies to every kind of black hole , be it rotating , charged or in arbitrary dimensions . in the general @xmath82 dimensional case the concept of two dimensional area only needs to be replaced by the @xmath83 dimensional measure of the horizon which we continue to call area .    _",
    "the thermal atmosphere _",
    "because the region above the horizon has a non - vanishing temperature , it has a kind of thermal atmosphere @xcite consisting of thermally excited quanta . in regions where the field theory is weakly",
    "coupled the thermal atmosphere consists of ordinary black body radiation .",
    "some of these quanta have sufficient energy to escape the gravitational pull of the black hole and appear as hawking radiation .",
    "however , for a large black hole , this process is very slow . the equilibrium approximation for the thermal atmosphere of the near horizon region is a very good one .",
    "the thermal atmosphere contributes to the entropy of the black hole @xcite .",
    "let us consider the ordinary quantum fields of the standard model or its suitable generalization .",
    "for simplicity lets ignore the interactions as well as masses .",
    "the entropy stored in the shell between @xmath75 and @xmath84 for free massless fields is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 constant proportional to the effective number of massless fields at that temperature .",
    "using @xmath87 we find @xmath88    evidently if this formula made sense all the way to @xmath89 the entropy of the black hole would be infinite .",
    "but since we know that the entropy is @xmath90 the field theory description must break down at some small @xmath91 .",
    "in this case the entropy in the thermal atmosphere of ordinary quanta will be @xmath92 since the total black hole entropy is @xmath90 the contribution from the thermal atmosphere must be less than this .",
    "accordingly @xcite @xmath91 can not be smaller than @xmath93 .    perhaps a more illuminating way to express",
    "this is to say that the number of effective degrees of freedom must tend to zero as the planck temperature is approached @xcite . in conventional quantum field theory",
    "the number of effective degrees of freedom is a non - decreasing function of temperature .",
    "the finiteness of black hole entropy is the first evidence that quantum field theory overestimates the number of independent degrees of freedom .",
    "it is not too surprising that quantum field theory has too many degrees of freedom at short distances to describe a world with gravity .",
    "the non - renormalizability of quantum gravity has led to many suggestions of a planck scale cutoff over the years .",
    "roughly speaking , the idea was that there should be about 1 binary degree of freedom per planck volume .",
    "what we will see in the following is that this idea still vastly overestimates the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the correct reduction in the number of degrees of freedom is that there is no more than @xmath94 degrees of freedom per planck volume where @xmath95 is infrared cutoff radius , that is , the size of the spatial region being studied .    _",
    "the quantum xerox principle _    the holographic principle represents a radical departure from the principles of local quantum field theory . in order to understand why we are driven to it",
    "we need to follow hawking s original arguments about the loss of quantum coherence in black hole processes .",
    "the argument as i will present it is based on a principle that i call the _ quantum xerox principle_. it prohibits the existence of a machine which can duplicate the information in a quantum system and in so doing , produce two copies of the original information . to illustrate an example , consider a two - state system with states @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we will call the system a q - bit .",
    "the general state of the q - bit is @xmath98    now assume we had a machine which could clone the q - bit and duplicate a second q - bit in the same state .",
    "we can express this by @xmath99 for example @xmath100 is fed into the machine .",
    "the output of the machine is @xmath101 in this way we see that the principles of quantum mechanics forbid the duplication of quantum information . what has all this to do with black holes ?",
    "consider the following thought experiment @xcite .",
    "a black hole is formed as in figure ( 6 ) . before the black hole has a chance to evaporate a q - bit",
    "is thrown in . according to the observer who falls with the q - bit",
    ", the information at a later time will be localized behind the horizon at point ( a ) in figure ( 8) . on the other hand an observer outside the horizon eventually sees all of the energy returned in the form of hawking radiation . in order that the usual laws of quantum mechanics are satisfied for the outside observer , the q - bit of information must be found in the state of the outgoing evaporation products localized at point ( b ) in figure ( 8) . since there can not be two copies of the same information it would seem that either the infalling observer or the outside observer must experience a violation of the known laws of nature .",
    "either the horizon is not such a benign place as we thought ( @xmath102 minkowski space ) and infalling matter is severely disrupted or else the outside observer experiences a loss of information in contradiction with quantum principles !",
    "the principle of black hole complementarity flatly denies that either of these undesirable things happens .",
    "according to this principle no real observer ever detects a violation of the usual laws of nature .",
    "external observations are assumed to be consistent with a description in which infalling information is absorbed , thermalized near the hot horizon and returned in the form of subtle correlations in the hawking radiation .",
    "furthermore , infalling observers detect nothing unusual at the almost flat horizon and only experience violent effects as the singularity is approached .",
    "reconciliation of these two facts will require that we radically modify our naive ideas of locality so that the space - time location of an event loses its invariant significance and becomes a relative concept .",
    "as we have seen , quantum mechanics forbids information cloning .",
    "let us take that to mean that no real observer is ever allowed to detect duplicate information .",
    "the outside observer has no problem with this since she can never detect signals from behind the horizon .",
    "however , it is more subtle to argue that observers behind the horizon can never detect duplicate information . here",
    "is how it might happen :    an observer , @xmath103 , stationed outside the horizon in figure ( 9 ) collects information stored in the hawking radiation .",
    "after some time she has collected the information stored in the infalling q - bit . at that time , she jumps into the black hole , carrying the information to point ( c ) behind the horizon .",
    "now there are two copies of the q - bit behind the horizon , one at ( a ) and one at ( c )",
    ". a signal from ( a ) to ( c ) can reveal that information has been duplicated .",
    "in fact we will argue that there is a _ quantum xerox censorship _ mechanism which always prevents this from happening . to understand it we need one more concept .",
    "_ information retention time _",
    "+ consider a conventional complex system such as a piece of coal .",
    "suppose the coal begins in its ground state and is heated by shining a laser beam on it .",
    "as its temperature rises it begins to glow and emit thermal radiation .",
    "assume the laser beam is modulated so that it can convey information and that it sends in a bit .",
    "let @xmath1 be the maximum entropy that the coal is heated to before being allowed to cool back to its ground state .",
    "by the time it does cool , all the information in the laser beam has been returned in the almost thermal radiation .",
    "an interesting question is how many photons are involved in carrying out the single bit .",
    "the answer has been given in a paper by don page @xcite .",
    "the number of photons that have to be measured in order to collect a single bit is of order @xmath104 .",
    "this is roughly half the photons that will be emitted .",
    "another way to s say it is that no information can be retrieved until the coal has cooled to the point where its entropy is about half its maximum value .    given the luminosity , this restriction on collecting information from thermal radiation can be translated to a time scale for the coal to retain the original bit .",
    "this time is called the information retention time . how long is it for a massive black hole ?",
    "the answer can easily be deduced from the known luminosity of black holes . in @xmath105 dimensions",
    "one finds @xmath106 for times much shorter than @xmath107 we can expect that information which has been absorbed by the thermal horizon to be inaccessible .    _ quantum xerox censorship _",
    "+ let us return to the thought experiment in figure ( 9 ) designed to detect information duplication behind the horizon .",
    "the resolution of the dilemma is as follows .",
    "the point ( c ) must occur before the trajectory of @xmath103 intersects the singularity . on the other hand @xmath103 may not cross the horizon until the information retention time has elapsed .",
    "the implication of these two constraints is most easily seen using ks coordinates @xmath108 an observer outside the horizon must wait a time @xmath109 to collect a bit from the hawking radiation .",
    "thus she may not jump into the black hole until @xmath110 . on the other hand",
    "the singularity is at @xmath111 .",
    "this means that @xmath103 will hit the singularity at a point satisfying @xmath112 thus for the original infalling system to send a signal which will reach @xmath103 before she hits the singularity , the message must be sent within a time interval @xmath113 of the same order of magnitude , an incredibly short time .    classically there is no obstruction to sending as much information as you like in as small a time as you like using as little energy as you like .",
    "quantum physics changes this .",
    "a bit of information requires at least one quantum to transmit it .",
    "the uncertainty principle requires that the quantum have energy of order @xmath114 .",
    "thus the message requires a photon of energy @xmath115 this is completely inconsistent with the assumption that the entire black hole , including the q - bit had energy @xmath40 . if the observer at ( a ) had that much energy available , the black hole would have been much heavier and its horizon would have been at a very different place .",
    "thus we see that quantum mechanics and gravity conspire to prevent @xmath103 from detecting duplicate information .",
    "we can now see that there is something wrong with the usual ideas of local quantum field theory in black hole backgrounds .",
    "the points ( a ) and ( b ) can be widely separated by a large space - like separation .",
    "quantum field theory would say that the fields at these two points are independent commuting variables and it would predict correlations between them . but as we have seen , these correlations are unmeasurable by any real observer subject to the usual limitations of relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "if you share the belief that a theory should not predict things which are in principle unobservable then you must conclude that local quantum field theory in a black hole background is the wrong starting point .    _ baryon violation and black hole horizons _ +",
    "it is generally conceded that there are no additive conserved quantities in a consistent quantum theory that includes gravity except for those that couple to long range fields .",
    "if nothing else , black hole evaporation will lead to violations of global conservation laws such as baryon conservation .",
    "an interesting question is where in the black hole geometry does the violation take place ? does it happen at or near the almost flat horizon or only at the violently curved singularity @xcite or , is it more subtle as suggested by black hole complementarity @xcite",
    "?    for definiteness lets assume that baryon violation takes place in a conventional grand unification scheme such as @xmath116 .",
    "begin with a system of baryons and an observer all falling freely through the horizon of a very large black hole .",
    "since the near horizon limit is nearly flat it is certain that the freely falling observer will detect negligible baryon violating effects in this region .",
    "however as time elapses the system will enter regions in which the curvature becomes of order the gut scale . at that point",
    "there is every reason to think that baryon violating effects will be observed if the observer is in any shape to observe them .",
    "the observer outside the black hole has a very different story to tell . according to him ,",
    "the baryonic system entered the near horizon region where it was subjected to increasing proper temperature .",
    "when the temperature becomes of order @xmath117 the baryons are exposed to a flux of high energy particles in the thermal atmosphere and baryon violating processes must occur .",
    "who is correct ?    in order to answer this question consider the propagation of a quark through empty space .",
    "virtual baryon violating processes of the kind shown in the feynman diagram in figure ( 10 ) are continuously taking place .",
    "in other words the quark spends part of the time in a virtual state with the wrong baryon number even in empty flat space .",
    "what percentage of the time is the baryon number wrong ? one might think the answer is incredibly small given the stability of the proton .",
    "but it is not .",
    "an explicit calculation gives a probability of order @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the gauge coupling constant .",
    "thus the quark has the wrong baryon number about 1 percent of the time .",
    "the reason we do nt see this as baryon violation is that the lifetime of the intermediate states is of order the gut scale .",
    "the baryon number is constantly undergoing very rapid quantum fluctuations .",
    "the usual approximately conserved quantum number is the time averaged baryon number normalized to 1 for the nucleon .",
    "now consider a quark falling through the horizon as in figure ( 11 ) .",
    "it is evident from the figure that there is a significant probability that when the quark passes the horizon at @xmath120 it has the wrong baryon number . from the viewpoint of the infalling observer doing ordinary low energy experiments on the baryon",
    "the fluctuation is too fast to see .",
    "however , from the outside the rapid fluctuations slow down and the quark is caught frozen with the wrong baryon number .",
    "of course the this description fails to take gravitation into account but it nevertheless shows that understanding the apparent contradictory descriptions involves analyzing the behavior of matter at extremely short time scales and high frequencies .    another thought experiment can illuminate the interplay between gravity and quantum mechanics .",
    "suppose an observer @xmath103 falls through the horizon just before the baryon as in figure ( 12 ) .",
    "this observer sends out a signal ( photon ) which interacts with the infalling baryon and measures its baryon number .",
    "the signal is then received by a distant observer .",
    "let us suppose that the experiment is arranged so that the signal - photon encounters the baryon in a region where the temperature is at least @xmath117 . in the rest frame of the infalling quark , it has a time of order @xmath121 before it crosses the horizon .",
    "thus the photon must be concentrated in a wave packet of size less that or equal to @xmath121 .",
    "its energy must be so high that it will resolve the baryon violating virtual state and will therefore have a finite probability of reporting baryon violation at the horizon . complementarity works !    _",
    "string theory at high frequency _ + ordinary quantum field theory can not resolve the paradoxes of black holes .",
    "we have already seen that q.f.t .",
    "drastically overestimates the number of ultraviolet degrees of freedom in the near horizon region and leads to a divergent entropy in the thermal atmosphere .",
    "string theory is widely believed to be a consistent quantum mechanical framework that includes gravitation . if so it must differ from q.f.t . in very non - trivial ways at short times",
    ".    although we are far from achieving a definitive understanding of black hole complementarity in string theory , there are some simple and suggestive ways to see that string theory is very different from q.f.t . at high frequency @xcite .",
    "let us consider a string falling through a horizon . for our purposes we can approximate the horizon by the light - like surface @xmath122 . to study the string",
    "as it falls we use light cone coordinates .",
    "it is conventional to use @xmath123 for the light cone time variable .",
    "we are going to be unconventional and use @xmath124 .",
    "thus we choose the string theory gauge @xmath125 the string starts out at negative @xmath124 and reaches the horizon at @xmath126 .",
    "suppose the string falls through the horizon near @xmath127 .",
    "using @xmath128 we find that near the string @xmath129    the unusual properties of strings can already be seen at the level of free string theory . in light cone gauge a free string",
    "is described by a set of transverse coordinates @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "the coordinates are expressed in terms of harmonic oscillator variables @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in string units",
    "@xmath134    the question that will interest us has to do with the spatial size of the string . for simplicity we will consider the ground state of the string which classically has zero size .",
    "we usually envision the quantum fluctuations to spread the string over a size of order @xmath135 , the string scale .",
    "however explicit calculation gives a very different result .",
    "the spatial size @xmath95 will be defined in an obvious way . @xmath136    using the standard commutation rules for the @xmath137 we find @xmath138 evidently the spatial size of the string is dependent of the frequency cutoff .",
    "if the frequency cutoff for a given observation is @xmath139 then the apparent size of the string is @xmath140    we see a small string only if we average over sufficient time ( @xmath141 ) to eliminate the very high frequencies .",

    "we restrict attention to those regions for which a given branch has a unique sign .",
    "we can now state bousso s rule :    from the boundary @xmath197 construct all light sheets which have negative expansion as we move away .",
    "these light sheets may terminate at the tip of a cone or a caustic or even a boundary of the geometry .",
    "bousso s bound states that the entropy passing through these light sheets is less that @xmath90 where @xmath80 is the boundary of @xmath197 .    to help visualize how bousso s construction works",
    "we will consider spherically symmetric geometries and use penrose diagrams to describe them .",
    "the penrose diagram represents the radial and time directions .",
    "each point of such a diagram really stands for a 2-sphere ( more generally a ( @xmath199)-sphere ) .",
    "the four branches at a given point on the penrose diagram are represented by a pair of 45 degree lines passing through that point .",
    "however we are only interested in the branches of negative expansion .",
    "for example in figure(16 ) we illustrate flat space - time and the negative expansion branches of a typical local 2-sphere .    in general as we move around in the penrose diagram the particular branches which have negative expansion may change .",
    "for example if the cosmology initially expands and then collapses , the outgoing future branch will go from positive to negative expansion .",
    "bousso introduced a notation to indicate this .",
    "the penrose diagram is divided into a number of regions depending on which branches have negative expansion . in each region",
    "the negative expansion branches are indicated by their directions at a typical point .",
    "thus in figure(17 ) we draw the penrose- bousso ( pb ) diagram for a positive curvature , matter dominated universe that begins with a bang and ends with a crunch .",
    "it consists of four distinct regions .    in region",
    "i of figure ( 17 ) the expansion of the universe causes both past branches to have negative expansion .",
    "thus we draw light surfaces into the past .",
    "these light surfaces terminate on the initial boundary of the geometry and are similar to the truncated cones that we discussed in the flat rw case .",
    "the holographic bound in this case says that the entropy passing through either backward light surface is bounded by the area of the 2-sphere at point @xmath174 .",
    "bousso s rule tells us nothing in this case about the entropy on space like surfaces bounded by @xmath174 .    now move on to region ii .",
    "the relevant light sheets in this region begin on the 2-sphere @xmath200 and both terminate at the spatial origin .",
    "these are untruncated cones and the entropy on both of them is holographically bounded .",
    "there is something new in this case .",
    "we find that the entropy is bounded on a future light sheet .",
    "now consider a space like surface bounded by @xmath200 and extending to the spatial origin .",
    "it is evident that any matter which passes through the space - like surface must also pass through the future light sheet . by the second law of thermodynamics",
    "the entropy on the space - like surface can not exceed the entropy on the future light sheet .",
    "thus in this case the entropy in a space - like region can be holographically bounded .",
    "thus , one condition for a space - like bound is that the entropy is bounded by a corresponding future light sheet . with this in mind",
    "we return to region i. for region i there is no future bound and therefore the entropy is not bounded on space - like regions with boundary @xmath174 .    in region",
    "iii the entropy bounds are both on future light sheets .",
    "nevertheless there is no space - like bound .",
    "the reason is that not all matter which passes through space - like surfaces is forced to pass through the future light sheets .",
    "region iv is identical to region ii with the spatial origin being replaced by the diametrically opposed antipode .",
    "thus we see that there are light - like bounds in all four regions but only in ii and iv are there holographic bounds on space - like regions .",
    "another example of interest is inflationary cosmology .",
    "the pb diagram for de - sitter space is shown in figure ( 18a ) .",
    "this time region i has both light sheets pointing to the future .",
    "this is due to the fact that de - sitter space is initially contracting . in order to describe inflationary cosmology",
    "we must terminate the de sitter space at some late time and attach it to a conventional rw space .",
    "this is shown in figure ( 18b ) .",
    "the dotted line where the two geometries are joined is the reheating surface where the entropy of the universe is created .",
    "let us focus on the point @xmath174 in figure ( 18b ) .",
    "it is easy to see that in an ordinary inflationary cosmology @xmath174 can be chosen so that the entropy on the space - like surface @xmath201 is bigger than the area of @xmath174 .",
    "however bousso s rule applied to point ( p ) only bounds the entropy on the past light sheet . in this case",
    "most of the newly formed entropy on the reheating surface is not counted since it never passed through the past light sheet .",
    "typical inflationary cosmologies can be studied to see that the past light sheet bound is not violated .    as a final example we consider anti - de sitter ( ads ) space .",
    "the pb diagram consists of an infinite strip bounded on the left by the spatial origin and of the right by the ads boundary .",
    "the pb diagram consists of a single region in which both negative expansion light sheets point toward the origin .",
    "let us consider a static surface of large area @xmath80 far from the spatial origin .",
    "the surface is denoted by the dotted vertical line @xmath202 in figure ( 19 ) .",
    "we will think of @xmath202 as an infrared cutoff .",

    "we begin with a spontaneously broken sym at finite temperature .",
    "it is well known that the mass of the @xmath304 boson is corrected by finite temperature effects .",
    "kabat and lifschytz argue that at finite temperature the tachyonic instability occurs at a non - zero value of @xmath54 .",
    "this value corresponds to the position of the horizon .",
    "the string theory correspondence gives a fairly convincing picture of the thermal effects on the @xmath304 mass @xcite .",

    "_ the flat space limit _    gauge theory , gravity correspondences are especially interesting because they provide nonperturbative definitions of some quantum - gravity systems .",
    "the first example was matrix theory which uses sym theory to define 11 dimensional supergravity in the dlcq framework . to effectively decompactify the light cone direction we must pass to the large @xmath250 limit keeping the gauge coupling fixed .",
    "it has also been proposed that the ads / cft correspondence can be used to give a non - perturbative definition of type iib string theory @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we regard ads space in the form of eq.(3.1 ) as a finite cavity with reflecting walls .",
    "it provides an ideal `` box '' for the purpose of infrared regulating a theory .",
    "although the actual metric distance from any point in the bulk geometry to the boundary is infinite , it nevertheless closely resembles an ordinary finite box of size @xmath95 .",
    "for example the time for light to propagate from @xmath8 to the boundary and back is finite @xmath309 .",
    "another indication of the finiteness of the box is that the energy eigenvalues of a particle moving in the metric ( 3.1 ) are discrete with the scale of energy being @xmath94 .    to define the infinite volume limit we want to let @xmath310 while keeping fixed the microscopic parameters of the theory such as @xmath119 and @xmath135 .",
    "we also want to keep fixed the energy and length scales in string units .",

    "the answer must be that any quantity that has a well defined flat space limit in ten dimensional iib string theory should correspond to a quantity with a good limit under ( 4.1 ) .",
    "the most obvious quantities are the spectrum and scattering matrix of stable particles .",
    "the only such particles are the massless supergravity multiplet .",
    "this includes kaluza - klein particles with non - zero momentum on the 5-sphere . from the point of view of the 5 dimensional ads",
    "space these objects have non zero mass but they are stable . the 5-dimensional ads mass of a particle with momentum @xmath317 on the 5-sphere is @xmath318 or in terms of the @xmath319 angular momentum @xmath320 @xmath321 the existence and stability of these ten - dimensionally massless particles has been established beyond doubt from properties of the sym theory ( see maldacena s lectures ) .",
    "the existence and properties of an s - matrix have also been studied @xcite@xcite but much less can be rigorously established .",
    "the idea for constructing scattering amplitudes is to use appropriate local gauge - invariant operators in the boundary theory as sources of the bulk particles .",
    "the particles can be aimed from the boundary toward the origin ( @xmath8 ) of the cavity and by carefully controlling the sources they can be made to interact in a small enough region that the curvature of the space is irrelevant .",
    "all kinds of interesting phenomena could occur during the collision .",
    "this includes the formation and evaporation of 10 dimensional black holes",
    ". you can look up the details of this kind of construction in the papers by polchinski and susskind @xcite @xcite . in this lecture",
    "we will concentrate on a couple of the poorly understood issues connected with the holographic description of in the interior of ads .",
    "the first issue has to do with the description of high energy particles far from the boundary .",
    "let us consider a massless graviton emitted from the boundary with vanishing @xmath319 momentum .",
    "the creation operator for emitting the graviton is made out of the energy - momentum tensor of the boundary theory by integrating @xmath322 with a test function whose frequency spectrum is concentrated around some value @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath323 acting with the resulting operator creates a graviton of bulk momentum @xmath174 propagating from the boundary toward the origin .",
    "once the particle has entered the bulk and passed the surrogate boundary at @xmath260 , the holographic principle requires that it has a description in the regulated sym theory with momentum cutoff @xmath324 .",
    "let us first consider the case of low graviton momentum by which we mean @xmath325 . in this case",
    "the source function is slowly varying on the cutoff scale and the ordinary renormalization group strategy applies . integrating out the modes beyond the cutoff results in a renormalized theory .",
    "because the sym theory is scale invariant , the cutoff theory has the same form as the original theory and the graviton is description is the same as in the continuum theory .",
    "however , the renormalization group does not apply to situations in which the field theoretic source functions vary more rapidly than the cutoff scale .",
    "thus if ( @xmath326 ) there is no guarantee that the cutoff theory can describe the graviton correctly .",
    "the problem is that the holographic principle demands that we be able to describe all the physical states in the region @xmath327 by states of the cutoff theory even if they contain high energy gravitons .    to phrase the paradox differently ,",
    "note that a massless particle with momentum @xmath174 moving in the @xmath219 direction can be localized in the @xmath188 plane with an uncertainty @xmath328 thus it should be possible to distinguish two such particles if their separation @xmath188 is of order @xmath329 or bigger . on the other hand the largest momenta in the cutoff sym theory is @xmath330 .",
    "how is it possible to construct such well localized objects out of the low momentum modes of the sym fields ?",
    "we will argue that the only possible answer is that the high energy graviton is created by operators that involve many sym quanta .",
    "in other words the effective operator which creates the high energy graviton in the cutoff theory must be high order in the fundamental sym fields .",
    "the order can be estimated by taking the total dimensionless energy @xmath47 of the graviton and dividing up among gauge quanta of energy @xmath324 .",
    "@xmath331 to illustrate the point consider an n - particle wave function ( as long as @xmath332 the sym quanta can be treated as non - identical boltzmann particles ) .",
    "as an example we choose a product wave function @xmath333 with @xmath334      suppose we have two such states which are identical except one of them is displaced a distance @xmath159 in the @xmath188 direction .",
    "the inner product of these states is given by @xmath335 the function @xmath336 in eq.(4.9 ) is narrowly peaked on the cutoff scale if @xmath337 is large .",
    "in other words these states are distinguishable when they are displaced by distance @xmath338 even though the largest individual momentum is only @xmath324 .",
    "thus we see that fine details can be distinguished in the coarse grained theory but only if the gravitons and other bulk particles are identified as an increasingly large number of gauge quanta as the uv cutoff of the sym is lowered and/or the momentum is increased .",
    "this is very similar to matrix theory in which a graviton of momentum @xmath339 is represented by a number of partons which grow with @xmath339 .",
    "so far we have considered particles which are massless in the 5 dimensional sense .",
    "now let us consider a graviton with non - vanishing 5-momentum @xmath317 .",
    "we want to hold @xmath317 fixed as we let @xmath340 .",
    "the 5 dimensional mass is @xmath317 .",
    "let us also assume @xmath174 , the momentum in the @xmath219 direction is also kept fixed .",
    "the dimensionless sym energy of the state is @xmath341    once again it is known how to create such particles by introducing a source at the boundary .",
    "the source in this case is a local gauge invariant sym operator of the form @xmath342 this expression stands for an nth order monomial in the scalar sym fields @xmath54 .",
    "the integer @xmath337 is equal to the @xmath319 angular momentum @xmath343 .",
    "@xmath344 to construct a creation operator for a particle of momentum @xmath345 we integrate @xmath346 with a test function of frequency @xmath47 given in eq.(4.10 ) .",
    "the puzzling feature of this prescription is that it injects the particle into the system with a local boundary operator .",
    "but a massive particle with energy @xmath347 can never get near the boundary .",
    "this can be seen from the motion of a massive classical particle in ads space . if a particle of mass @xmath40 moves along the @xmath219 axis with total bulk energy @xmath348 then the closest it comes to the boundary is @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the classical turning point of the trajectory .",
    "it is also true that the solution of the classical wave equation for such a particle has its largest value at this point . for @xmath351 the wave function",
    "quickly goes to zero .",
    "somehow the local boundary field @xmath346 must be creating bulk particles far from the boundary .",
    "this behavior can be qualitatively be understood in an elementary way from the sym theory .",
    "the operator @xmath346 in eq.(4.11 ) describes the creation of @xmath337 quanta .",
    "suppose that the sym energy @xmath47 is divided among the quanta so that each carries @xmath352 .",
    "equivalently the quanta have wave length @xmath353 . according to the uv / ir connection quanta of this wave length correspond to bulk phenomena at @xmath354 . using eqs.(4.10 ) and",
    "( 4.12 ) we see that this corresponds to the position @xmath355 . in this way",
    "we see that the local operator constructed from @xmath346 by projecting out given frequency components actually corresponds to a bulk particle at its classical turning point .    before concluding this final lecture",
    "the are some negative features of holographic descriptions which need to be mentioned .",
    "these negative features become apparent when we begin to ask how ordinary phenomena near the origin of a very large ads space are described in sym theory @xcite @xcite .",
    "suppose we have some object which may be macroscopic in size but which is very much smaller than the radius of curvature @xmath95 . according to the uv / ir connection",
    "if the object is near the origin only the longest wavelength modes of the sym fields should be important for their description .",
    "on the 3-sphere this means the almost homogeneous modes .",
    "the number of such homogeneous modes is of order @xmath274 and these must be the degrees of freedom which describe entire physics within a region of size @xmath95 near the origin . in other words all the physics within a region small enough to be considered flat must be described by the matrix degrees of freedom of the sym and not by the spatial variations of the fields .",
    "there is nothing wrong with this except that we have no idea how to translate ordinary physics into the holographic description .",
    "for example we would have no idea how to determine if a given sym state were describing a small ten dimensional black hole , a rock or an elephant of the same mass .",
    "i would like to suggest that there is a way to do physics which is complementary to the holographic way but in which bulk phenomena are much easier to recognize .",
    "i would expect that this new way would be in terms of local bulk fields which would either include the gravitational field or would allow its construction in some simple way .",
    "what would be unusual about this theory is that it would be extremely rich in gauge redundancies , so rich in fact that when the gauge is completely fixed and the non - redundant degrees of freedom are counted their number would be proportional to the area in planck units . by some particular gauge fixing this",
    "would be made manifest .",
    "but after insuring ourselves that the counting is holographic other gauge choices might be much better for recognizing ordinary local physics .",
    "the kind of theory i have in mind is some generalization of chern simons theory which does have the property that the real states live on the boundary .",
    "unfortunately this is just a speculation at the moment ."
