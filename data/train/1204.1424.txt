    "one of the central problems in nano science and technology  @xcite is the realization of high - precision nano manipulation , e.g. , pushing , pulling , rotating , rolling , and cutting nano - scale objects . in the widely applied afm experiments",
    "@xcite , a large amount of frontier progresses have been achieved about nano manipulation .",
    "however , the theoretical analysis for such system is mainly focused on the static force analysis within a newton - mechanical framework  @xcite that describes the macroscopic system .",
    "recent experiments show that the force analysis in the nano scale is not the same as that at the macroscopic scale . typically , nano - scale friction  @xcite is logarithmically dependent on the velocity  @xcite , which is quite different from the macroscopic sliding friction ( the friction is independent on the velocity ) and the traditional viscous - type friction ( the friction is linearly proportional to the velocity ) .",
    "additionally , the atomic scale periodic structure on the substrate has to be seriously considered in the friction analysis that is usually done with the continuous mechanics in macroscopic system  @xcite .",
    "the periodic lateral force induced by the atomic periodic structure on the surface of the substrate may lead to stick - slip motions  @xcite of the cantilever tip of the afm , which deteriorates the precision of the nano manipulation . in the literature  @xcite",
    ", the cantilever of the afm is usually modelled as a soft spring , and the effective nano friction force is described by a sinusoidal lateral force .",
    "temperature - dependent white noises are introduced to represent the stochastic fluctuations in the lateral force induced by the thermal motion of the substrate atoms .",
    "such a dynamical model predicts a motion transition of the cantilever tip of the afm from the continuous sliding to a stick - slip mode by varying the ratio between the amplitude of the sinusoidal lateral force and the stiffness of the cantilever tip .    to improve the precision in nano manipulation , many strategies",
    "@xcite have been proposed to control the motions of the nano objects under nano frictions .",
    "for example , in the literature  @xcite , the authors designed a non - lipschitzion control function under which one can push the nano sample to asymptotically track the target velocity .",
    "this proposal is efficient and robust , but the natural fluctuation can not be removed . to overcome",
    "this difficulty , more complex control function was designed based on the lyapunov theory in refs .",
    "however , the control designs in these proposals require the knowledge of the exact position of the sample during the nano manipulation .",
    "such schemes are uneasy to be realized with the present experimental techniques , e.g. , the haptic sensing and the virtual reality visual feedback techniques  @xcite , for the inability of simultaneous position sensing and manipulation processing by the afm .",
    "in fact , in these techniques , one has to stop the nano manipulation process and scan the surface of the substrate by the cantilever tip of the afm to position the sample on the substrate , after which the next step of nano manipulation can go on . to solve this problem , in this paper ,",
    "we propose a feedback control strategy based on the real - time signal sampled from the force sensor of the afm , which can be conditionally done without pending the nano manipulation .",
    "the signal is used to estimate the position of the cantilever tip of the afm , with which we can design feedback control to reduce the stick - slip motion of the cantilever tip and thus improve the manipulation precision .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s2 ] describes the dynamical model , following which the stick - slip motions of the cantilever tip under open - loop control are presented in sec .",
    "section  [ s4 ] is devoted to the design of the real - time feedback control to reduce the stick - slip motion of the cantilever tip .",

    "_ by adjusting the voltage @xmath4 added on the pzt via a control circuit , the deformation of the pzt can be controlled , by which the relative position @xmath3 between the cantilever of the afm and the platform is tunable .",
    "_ typically , the functional relationship between the deformation of the pzt and the voltage @xmath4 shows hysteresis , creep , and structural vibration behaviors and thus is nonlinear .",
    "however , such a nonlinear characteristic response of pzt can be compensated by auxiliary control devices .",
    "our recent theoretical and experimental study  @xcite shows that a linear functional relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath3 can be obtained by introducing optimal design of feedforward controller by the prandtl - ishlinskii model  @xcite .",
    "based on this study , in order to simplify our discussions , we do not go into details about the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath3 , _ but simply take the deformation of the pzt represented by @xmath3 as the control parameter_. additionally , in the moving frame of the platform , the control system shown in fig .",

    "the origin of coordinate is chosen such that the periodic lateral force is zero at the origin .",
    "thus , the resulting modification of the lateral force can be expressed as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the amplitude of the periodic lateral force ; @xmath12 is the lattice constant of the substrate ; and @xmath13 is a white noise such that @xmath14 , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the strength .",

    "the drawbacks of the open - loop constant control can be seen from the following numerical examples .",

    "in this section , we introduce feedback control to reduce this unexpected stick - slip motion under open - loop control .",
    "the object of our method is to monitor the deformation of the cantilever and thus make the cantilever tip move with a given constant velocity .    to acquire feedback signals , there are two available sensing methods supported by the afm - based nano manipulation systems : position sensing and force sensing .",
    "position sensing is one of the basic functions of the afm , by which one can easily obtain the tomography of a surface with nano - scale roughness .",
    "however , real - time position sensing is unavailable during the nano manipulation . another sensing capacity of the afm is the force sensing , which can be done by detecting the deformation of the cantilever of the afm . in contrast with",
