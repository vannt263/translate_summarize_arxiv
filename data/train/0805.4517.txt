    "chromospherically active binaries ( cab ) are the class of binary stars with spectral types later than f characterized by a strong chromosphere , transition region , and coronal activity .",
    "enhanced emission cores of ca ii h&k lines , and emission filling in the balmer @xmath0 occasionally above the continuum are primary indicators of chromospheric activity and are often accompanied by photometric variability caused by starspots analogous to sunspots .",
    "combining rs canum venaticorum ( rs cvn ) stars , first defined by @xcite with a preliminary list of 40 ; later with an improved list of 69 by @xcite , and by draconis ( by dra ) defined by @xcite with 13 binaries , and then including early attempts of collections @xcite , the first version of the cab catalogue , ( ccabs ) , was published with 168 cab stars by @xcite . in the second version , ( cabs ) , the catalogue was revised and published in the same format with contents of 206 cab stars by @xcite , which is out dated now .",
    "especially after _ hipparcos _ mission @xcite , the number of cab systems is increased and data quality improved very much .",
    "eker had been compiling catalog data for cab systems privately even after his contribution @xcite to the first version @xcite .",
    "containing 284 stars , this unpublished list was the source and starting point of recent studies @xcite at which first observational evidence of dynamical evolution of binary star orbits , most probably driven by orbital angular momentum loss via magnetic braking mechanism @xcite , was extracted from the galactic space velocities and the kinematical ages of cab .",
    "these studies reminded us once more that collecting catalog data is the first step of doing science .",
    "cataloguing is not only good for directing observers to observe under studied systems and provide basic data , but also is good for reporting most reliable physical parameters and improve statistical significance which could be essential for such specialized studies , and useful for understanding dynamo mechanism , role of magnetic activity in single or binary star evolutions , stellar activity and activity cycles , dynamical evolution etc .",
    "starting from already existing but incomplete list of eker , which practically contains the two earlier versions of cab catalogue , we have revised inputs of individual stars in the list and searched new cab members through the literature and finalized the current version .",
    "the catalog data should be considered updated up to december , 2007 .",
    "the newly identified cab stars in the present catalogue were collected from various sources .",
    "basic sources are chromospherically active binary candidate list of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , sb9 catalogue of binary stars by @xcite , and list of stars claimed to be rs cvn or by dra in simbad database which are not in the earlier versions of cab catalogues .",
    "published articles containing the names of the stars in the tentative list are searched one by one in nasa / ads services . if binarity and chromospheric activity are confirmed in the published papers , the other input data of the catalogue are searched and gathered . however , we also investigated a limited number of stars , which are binaries , chromospheric activity information was missing or , chromospheric activity was confirmed but binarity was not openly confirmed in the literature .",
    "some of such stars were also included in the present version of the cab catalogue according to the criteria of selecting cab stars explained in section 3 .",
    "the current version of the catalogue ( cabs iii ) is available only in electronic format . with 203 new identifications ,",
    "the number of cab systems is increased to 409 .",
    "fig . 1 compares orbital period distribution of current catalogue and previous version @xcite .",
    "relative increases of the number of cab systems at various periods are clear . fig .",
    "2 displays a similar comparison of maximum visual brightness @xmath1 .",
    "new identifications sharply increase for @xmath2 mag .",
    "this must be due to increasing accuracies and photometric limit of modern instruments and mostly because of _ hipparcos _ identifications .",

    "the present catalogue contains 1855 rows of data sorted in the order of catalogue number ( cabs iii ) according to increasing right ascension and its sub - orders .",
    "more than one line of input data for each star aims to summarize all available specialized studies ( columns ) for the catalogue stars",
    ". lines of each star are organized such that the most reliable entry is in the first line .",
    "auxiliary information ( extra lines ) are for researchers or users who like comparing earlier or other entries from different sources .",
    "each entry ( column ) followed by a column to contain reference numbers .",
    "a reference number indicates the original source of the entry . nevertheless , there are some columns which does not need a reference or there are columns with verbal information followed by a reference number or numbers indicated in a parenthesis .",
    "square parentheses mean the entries are computed by us from the other information available in the present catalogue .",
    "columns are organized : as order ; ( cabs iii ) number ; sub - order ; star names ; maximum brightness in johnson @xmath3 magnitude ; wave amplitude ; photometric , migration and cycle periods ; johnson s colours ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) ; spectral types for components ; nature of binarity ( e.g. sb1 , sb2 and sb3 ) , effective temperatures ; iron abundance relative to sun ; logarithmic lithium abundances ( on a scale with @xmath8 ) ; projected rotational velocities ; ca ii h&k and h@xmath9 emissions ; luminosity , flux or information of x - ray , uv , ir and radio ; orbital periods and relative orbital period variations ; starting phase as a heliocentric julian date ; center of mass velocity ; semiamplitude of components ( e.g. @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) ; eccentricity ; longitude of periastron ; semi - major axis of apparent orbits ; distances from sun ; radii , mass and mass functions ; nature of eclipses ; inclination of orbits ; information of spot modeling ; ratio of contributing fluxes between components and wavelength region of this flux ratio ; absolute magnitude of the system ; magnetic field strength and polarization .",
    "the explanations of columns and special entries in the catalogue are given in the electronic form ( _ readme _ file in simdab ) .",
    "the primary criteria for choosing cab are in the first paragraph of the introduction . basically , by definition",
    ", there are two necessary conditions ; binarity and chromospheric activity , if both are fulfilled for a stellar system , it is sufficient to identify the system as one of the cab .",
    "despite conditions are that clear , the borderlines of identification could be vague or imprecise .      among the 409 cab stars in the catalog , 308 have orbital parameters determined from their radial velocity data , so binarity can not be doubted . for the rest binarity has been assured either because systems have eclipsing light curves , or dispersions of radial velocity data are confirmed to be much bigger than observational errors of radial velocities .",
    "detection of line doubling and variable radial velocity of components are sufficient to claim such a system to be sb2 even without orbital parameters . for sb1 systems , if there is no evidence of pulsations , variable radial velocity of a single component on the spectrum strongly favors binarity",
    ". statistics of radial velocity data for sb1 systems without orbital parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "having maculation wave and photometric periods , those systems are unlikely to be pulsating variables .",
    "data in the table strongly favor those 22 systems are binaries .

    "the catalogues , especially such as cab , w uma , fk com , rr lyr , cepheids , cataclysmic variables etc . , are never complete .",
    "this is because not only there are always new identifications and even if there is no new identifications there are new accurate observations and newer studies , but also because there would be some missing information ( columns ) , at which some scientists would wish to have depending upon their special interests .",
    "here we were careful to present at least very basic observational and first order evaluation of observations such as orbital parameters and physical quantities of the systems .",
    "missing second order data , e.g. space distributions and velocities , evolutionary , isochronal or kinematical ages , we think , must be left out because such information can be derived from the present data later according to the personal style of researchers who would prefer to re - derive them .",
    "some second order data may require specialization , e.g. x - ray , uv , radio etc .",
    "3 compares period histogram of northern ( @xmath14 ) and southern ( @xmath15 ) stars , where understudied nature of southern are displayed clearly .",
    "we encourage observers to give extra care to study more southern systems in order to improve homogeneity in the sky distribution , which is crucial for studies such as space distributions , luminosity functions , space velocities , kinematics ages of cab in the solar neighbourhood    , white bars ) and southern ( @xmath15 , black bars ) cab systems in the present catalogue . ]",
