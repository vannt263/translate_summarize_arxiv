    "the large number of bright , early - type stars within or behind the vela supernova remnant ( snr ) makes this remnant especially well suited for the study of high velocity absorption features from shocked gases .",
    "an especially interesting example is the star hd72089 , discovered by jenkins & wallerstein ( 1984 ) to have at least six distinct velocity components in ca  ii .",
    "hst observations of hd72089 using the g160 m grating on ghrs ( @xmath3 ) revealed the presence of high velocity c  i features with extraordinarily strong absorption coming from excited fine - structure levels , indicating the gas is strongly compressed ( jenkins & wallerstein 1995 , hereafter jw95 ) . in their study of gas - phase element abundances in the halo of the galaxy ,",
    "jenkins & wallerstein ( 1996 , hereafter jw96 ) used the pattern of element abundances in the high velocity components toward hd72089 as a comparison standard for reduced depletions caused by the destruction of grains in shocks . with new observations of this star covering the spectral region from 1196.4  to 1397.2    by stis on hst",
    ", we are able to arrive at more accurate results for the nature of the high velocity gas .",
    "hd72089 is a star with @xmath4 and a spectral classification b5  ii - iii ( houck 1978 ) that is about 1.7  kpc away from us , located behind the western edge of the vela snr .",
    "we present in this letter observations of this star taken on 30  may  1997 0022@xmath10354 ut to demonstrate the performance of the high - resolution uv echelle spectrograph ( e140h mode ) on stis with the @xmath5 arc - sec entrance aperture .",
    "photoevents registered by the mama detector were recorded in the time - tag mode .",
    "we created a 2048x2048 hi - res image ( 2 samples per mama pixel ) with corrections for the position of each time - tagged count to compensate for ( 1 ) the orbital doppler motion ( amplitude = 10 hi - res pixels ) and ( 2 ) the motion caused by thermal distortions ( 0.2 hi - res pixels per hour , measured from the slow drift of the spectral lines within the data ) .",
    "our spectra were taken from simple , unweighted extractions with background levels defined by the bottoms of obviously saturated lines . in cases where lines of interest appeared twice in adjacent orders ,",
    "the overlapping coverages were co - added .",
    "the wavelength scale was computed using a pre - launch dispersion relation corrected for a zero point wavelength shift computed from a wavelength calibration observation taken with the data .",
    "the precision of this scale is shown by the excellent agreement for the derived wavelengths of narrow features seen in two different orders .",
    "also , the velocities of our c  i components agree to within @xmath6 ( rms error ) with those of na  i observed by danks & sembach ( 1995 ) .    except in the vicinity of the strong stellar ly-@xmath7 line , our derived spectrum has a signal - to - noise ratio of about 32 . from a narrow line of cl",
    "i ( not discussed here ) , we estimate that the instrumental profile is a gaussian with a fwhm equal to @xmath8 . in this letter , we focus principally on the absorption lines of c  i (  [ ci ] ) with their noteworthy levels of fine - structure excitation , and in  [ atoms ] we report on some key elements that show up in ionization stages that are favored in normal h  i regions .",
    "in the ism , the excited @xmath9 and @xmath10 fine - structure levels ( denoted c  i@xmath11 and c  i@xmath12 ) in the ground state of can be populated by collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms , electrons and protons ( bahcall & wolf 1968 ; jenkins & shaya 1979 ; keenan 1989 ; roueff & le bourlot 1990 ) . in the previous _ hst _ study of hd 72089 , jw95 measured remarkably strong @xmath11 and @xmath12 lines in the component at @xmath13 . the large implied gas pressure suggested that this absorption arises in compressed gas following a shock inside a cloud that had been hit by the supernova blast wave .",
    "our new stis observations of hd 72089 have substantially improved resolution and provide an opportunity to verify and refine the results of jw95 .",
    "we analyzed multiplets near 1277  , 1280  , and 1329  using a component fitting technique ( spitzer & fitzpatrick 1993 ; fitzpatrick & spitzer 1997 ) that minimizes the @xmath14 between the fit and the data to determine the set of velocity centroids , @xmath15-values , and column densities , assuming the original intensities were convolved with an instrumental line spread function consisting of a gaussian with fwhm = 4 hi - res pixels .",
    "a comparison of the derived fits with the recorded spectra near the 1277   and 1329   absorption complexes is shown in figure  [ cifig ] .",
    "the parameters for the 7 individual absorption components are given in table  [ cextab ] .",
    "the associated 1@xmath16 errors include the effects of random photon noise , residual fixed pattern noise and uncertainties in determining the continuum .",
    "since we relied on empirically derived backgrounds , there may be additional systematic errors at the @xmath175% level .",
    "such errors , however , will tend to shift all of the , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 column densities in a given multiplet in the same direction and thus will not significantly affect the derived population ratios , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , listed in the last two columns of the table .",
    "figure  [ cifig ] indicates that many lines are free from blending , and consequently the component parameters are well - constrained by the data .",

    "the general character of the velocity components for ionization stages of elements that have an ip  @xmath32  13.6  ev is very different from the narrow components seen in c  i. c  i emphasizes mostly regions that have large internal densities , while lines from such species as c  ii , n  i , o  i , si  ii , s  ii , and ni  ii are likely to arise from a much broader range of conditions in generally lower density clouds .",
    "it is no surprise that the latter group display lines that have a broad velocity extent with virtually no evidence for narrow , unresolved substructures ( see below ) .",
    "for this reason , we choose to analyze the features in the context of their apparent optical depths @xmath33 as a function of radial velocity @xmath34 ( savage & sembach 1991 ; jenkins 1996 ) , a concept that is more general than component fitting .",
    "for the line complexes of n  i , o  i , si  ii and s  ii , the saturation at low velocities was too large to allow any column density determinations ( see fig .  [ stack ] ) . the lines of c  ii and c  ii@xmath11 near 1335  were hopelessly saturated at all velocities .    to within the noise fluctuations , the high - velocity components of the weakest lines of n  i , s  ii and si  ii@xmath11 yield values of apparent column density , @xmath35 , that are consistent with those from the strongest lines .",
    "the lines for these three species cover ranges of @xmath36 that differ by factors of 3 , 3 and 10 , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , the strong line of si  ii at 1260.422    has very serious interference from the line of fe  ii at 1260.533   , so we can not compare it with the weaker feature at 1304.370   .",
    "the good agreements indicate that the derived @xmath37 s are not underestimated because of the presence of saturated substructures that are not resolved by the instrument ( and this probably applies to many species other than n  i , s  ii and si  ii@xmath11 ) .",
