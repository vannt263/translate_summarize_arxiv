    "<S> this value follows from the linear realization of the @xmath16 symmetry in conjunction with the restriction to dimension-4 terms as embodied in the standard electroweak theory @xcite . realizing @xmath17 symmetry non - linearly , or else removing the restriction to dimension-4 terms in the linearized form , removes the restriction @xmath18 , e.g. @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that @xmath18 corresponds to a gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath19 , of the @xmath0 of magnitude @xmath20 , in units of the particle s bohr - magneton @xmath21 , while @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 as obtained for a classical rotating charge distribution . in general @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath20 puts the electromagnetic properties of the @xmath0 in close analogy to the @xmath20 value of the spin-@xmath25 dirac theory .    in order to relate @xmath10 and @xmath11 to the parameters in the lagrangian before diagonalization of the neutral sector , it is advantageous to rewrite ( [ xdellag ] ) in terms of unmixed neutral vector boson fields . for the present purpose </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to describe mixing in terms of current - mixing @xcite , i.e a mixing term between the third component of the weak isotriplet , @xmath26 , and the photon field tensor , which is denoted by @xmath27 in order to discriminate @xmath28 from the physical photon field tensor @xmath29 emerging upon diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> for details we refer to @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the relations between @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath13 and @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 are given by ( [ kappagam ] ) and @xmath36 the standard model thus corresponds to @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the lagrangian ( [ lint ] ) in some detail . </S>",

    "<S> note that this term is contained in the kinetic term for the @xmath32 fields , @xmath39 provided we use the non - abelian field tensor , @xmath40 for @xmath41 , the kinetic term reduces to a triplet of abelian vector boson fields , is obviously broken by the mass terms for the vector bosons . ] . </S>",

    "<S> a term of strength @xmath35 which violates @xmath4 symmetry independently of the presence of the photon field </S>",
    "<S> . imposing the constraint of no intrinsic @xmath4 violation@xcite , i.e. @xmath4 symmetry , when electromagnetism in ( [ lint ] ) is absent , we have to require @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath42 this requirement is abstracted from its empirical validity in the vector boson mass term and is sometimes called custodial @xmath43 symmetry . * the two terms describing the electromagnetic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the term containing @xmath44 in ( [ lint ] ) is simply obtained by applying the minimal substitution principle , @xmath45 , @xmath46 being the charge operator , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , to the derivatives in the kinetic term ( [ wkin ] ) of the @xmath32 triplet . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous magnetic moment term @xmath13 , @xmath49 in ( [ lint ] ) , on the other hand , need not necessarily be present , even though it is not excluded by the principle of minimal substitution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , adding the @xmath4-invariant total derivative term @xmath50 to the kinetic term ( [ wkin ] ) and carrying out the minimal substitution prescription implies the electromagnetic interaction ( [ lint ] ) with an arbitrary value of @xmath51 . </S>",

    "<S> this is in contrast to the case of the massive neutral vector boson , where the third component of the triplet in ( [ lint ] ) couples with a strength @xmath34 different from the strength of the @xmath54 coupling , @xmath55 , in ( [ xdellag ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we note in passing that the mentioned @xmath4-symmetry properties of the terms multiplied by @xmath34 and @xmath35 in ( [ lint ] ) are not a unique feature of the @xmath56 basis . </S>",
    "<S> the physical interpretation of the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 is thus not only valid in this basis . indeed , expressing ( [ xdellag ] ) in terms of the more conventional @xmath57 basis via @xmath58 one obtains the lagrangian in the form @xmath59.\\label{lbw3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this form of the lagrangian coincides with ( [ lint ] ) in the first two terms apart from @xmath60 being replaced by @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the fact that the second columns of the matrices in ( [ trafo1 ] ) and ( [ trafo2 ] ) are identical . obviously , however , the @xmath62-dependent terms in ( [ lbw3 ] ) differ from the @xmath63 terms in ( [ lint ] ) .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , it is a characteristic feature of a non - abelian theory to contain a coupling @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> experimental evidence for @xmath64 thus provides evidence for a non - abelian structure of the interactions among the members of the @xmath32 triplet and rules out a theory based on three abelian vector boson fields .    it is a second characteristic feature of the non - abelian nature of the standard model interactions to contain an anomalous magnetic dipole moment term of definite strength , @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> while a precision measurement of @xmath13 will be difficult , empirical evidence for @xmath65 will nevertheless provide first direct experimental evidence for the existence of an anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the @xmath0 vector bosons .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn to the experimental search for a non - abelian coupling , @xmath64 , and the search for an anomalous magnetic dipole moment , @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the present most stringent direct bound to the @xmath66-coupling @xmath9 @xcite is @xmath67 at 95% cl coupling . </S>",

    "<S> we consider a measurement of the total cross section of @xmath70 at lep  2 with a cut @xmath71 on the scattering angle . </S>",
    "<S> formulae for the cross section in terms of the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath10 have been given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the decay mode @xmath73 will be detected at lep  2 , where the lepton @xmath74 can be either an electron ( positron ) or a muon ( anti - muon ) . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio for this decay mode is 29.6% . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that future data are identical to the standard model predictions and calculate the lines of constant @xmath75 ( 86.5% cl ) and @xmath76 ( 39.4% cl ) in the @xmath9-@xmath10-plane according to such that the statistical error is given by @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> if one uses the error estimated from the experiment , @xmath78 , instead of the statistical error in the denominator of ( [ chi2 ] ) , the values of the parameter pair ( @xmath79 ) which have @xmath75 or @xmath76 change only little provided the number of measured events , @xmath80 , is much greater than one , @xmath81 . </S>",

    "<S> we show the @xmath85 and @xmath86 contours in the @xmath87 plane for an integrated luminosity of @xmath88 , at @xmath89 175 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we see that this very small value of @xmath90 , corresponding to a few weeks of running at lep  2 , is sufficient to detect a genuine non - zero non - abelian coupling , @xmath64 , at the @xmath86 level . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , a vanishing anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath22 , in conjunction with an abelian @xmath32 triplet , @xmath41 , is excluded . </S>",
    "<S> we note that similar results can be obtained with @xmath91 at @xmath92 gev and with @xmath93 at @xmath94 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> to detect a non - vanishing magnetic dipole moment , @xmath49 , in the presence of a non - vanishing non - abelian coupling , @xmath64 , needs a somewhat higher integrated luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the result in figure [ fig2 ] corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath95 at @xmath2 gev , thus providing direct evidence for a non - vanishing anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the @xmath96 , @xmath65 . since a sufficient number of standard events , @xmath97 , is expected in this case , </S>",
    "<S> the events can be arranged in 6 bins equidistant over the scattering angle @xmath98 , leading to the result also presented in figure [ fig2 ] . in the same figure </S>",
    "<S> we also show the theoretical prediction corresponding to a vanishing @xmath99 coupling , @xmath100 , corresponding to @xmath101 in ( [ xdellag ] ) , and @xmath102 , which is similarly ruled out .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> after a few weeks of running at @xmath2 gev at lep  2 , definite direct evidence for the existence of a genuine , non - vanishing coupling among the members of the @xmath103 triplet , characteristic of a non - abelian structure , can be obtained . likewise , after 7 months of running at lep  2 , definite evidence for a non - vanishing anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the charged vector bosons may be expected . </S>"
