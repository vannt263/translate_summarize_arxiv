    "the recent discoveries of the massive neutron stars psr j@xmath0  @xcite and psr j@xmath1  @xcite have brought new challenges for theories of dense matter beyond the nuclear saturation density .",
    "recently the radio timing measurements of the pulsar psr j@xmath0 and its white dwarf companion have confirmed the mass of the pulsar to be in the range of @xmath7 m@xmath8 at @xmath9 or @xmath10 m@xmath8 at @xmath11 confidence  @xcite .",
    "this is only the second neutron star(ns ) with a precisely determined mass around 2m@xmath8 , after psr j@xmath1 and has a 3@xmath6 lower mass limit @xmath12 m@xmath8 higher than the latter .",
    "it therefore provides the tightest reliable lower bound on the maximum mass of neutron stars .",
    "compact stars provide the perfect astrophysical environment for testing theories of cold and dense matter .",
    "densities at the core of neutron stars can reach values of several times of @xmath13 . at such high densities ,",
    "the energies of the particles are high enough to favour the appearance of exotic particles in the core .",
    "since the lifetime of neutron stars are much greater than those associated with the weak interaction , strangeness conservation can be violated in the core due to the weak interaction .",
    "this would result in the appearance of strange particles such as hyperons .",
    "the appearance of such particles produces new degrees of freedom , which results in a softer equation of state ( eos ) in the neutron star interior .",
    "the observable properties of compact stars depend crucially on the eos . according to the existing models of dense matter",
    "the presence of strangeness in the neutron star interior leads to a considerable softening of the eos , resulting in a reduction of the maximum mass of the neutron star  @xcite .",
    "therefore many existing theories involving hyperons can not explain the large pulsar masses  @xcite .",
    "most relativistic models obtain maximum neutron star masses in the range @xmath14  @xcite , when hyperons are included .",
    "some authors have tackled this problem by including a strong vector repulsion in the strange sector or by pushing the threshold for the appearance of hyperons to higher densities  @xcite . in several studies",
    "the maximum neutron star masses were generally found to be lower than @xmath15  @xcite which is in contradiction with observed pulsar masses .",
    "however , neutron stars with maximum mass larger than @xmath16 have been obtained theoretically .",
    "bednarek  @xcite achieved a stiffening of the eos by using a non - linear relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model with quartic terms involving the strange vector meson .",
    "lastowiecki  @xcite obtained massive stars including a quark matter core .",
    "taurines  @xcite achieved large neutron star masses including hyperons by considering a model with density dependent coupling constants .",
    "the coupling constants were varied nonlinearly with the scalar field .",
    "bonanno and sedrakian  @xcite also modeled massive neutron stars including hyperons and quark core using a fairly stiff eos and vector repulsion among quarks .",
    "authors in ref .",
    "@xcite incorporated higher order couplings in the rmf theory in addition to kaonic interactions to obtain the maximum neutron star mass .",
    "agrawal @xcite have optimized the parameters of the extended rmf model using a selected set of global observables which includes binding energies and charge radii for nuclei along several isotopic and isotonic chains and the iso - scalar giant monopole resonance energies for the @xmath17zr and @xmath18pb nuclei .",
    "weissenborn  @xcite investigated the vector meson - hyperon coupling , going from su(6 ) quark model to a broader su(3 ) , and concluded that the maximum mass of a neutron star decreases linearly with the strangeness content of the neutron star core independent of the nuclear eos .",
    "on the other hand , h. dapo  @xcite found that for several different bare hyperon - nucleon potentials and a wide range of nuclear matter parameters the hyperons in neutron stars are always present .",
    "the parameters of the rmf model are fitted to the saturation properties of the infinite nuclear matter and/or the properties of finite nuclei . as a result extrapolation to higher densities and asymmetry",
    "involve uncertainties .",
    "three of these properties of the infinite nuclear matter are more precisely known : ( a ) the saturation density , ( b ) the binding energy and ( c ) the asymmetry energy , compared to the remaining ones - the effective nucleon mass and the compression modulus of the nuclear matter .",
    "the uncertainty in the dense matter eos is basically related to the uncertainty in these two saturation properties .",
    "it has been seen that to reproduce the giant monopole resonance ( gmr ) in @xmath18pb , accurately fitted non - relativistic and relativistic models predict compression modulus in the symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath19 ) that differ by about @xmath20 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy being the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "moreover , the alluded correlation between @xmath19 and the density dependence of the symmetry energy results in an underestimation of the frequency of oscillations of neutrons against protons , the so - called isovector giant dipole resonance ( ivgdr ) in @xmath18pb .",
    "fsugold is a recently proposed accurately calibrated relativistic parameterization .",
    "it simultaneously describes the gmr in @xmath17zr and @xmath18pb and the ivgdr in @xmath18pb without compromising the success in reproducing the ground - state observables  @xcite .",
    "the main virtue of this parameterization is the softening of both the eos of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy .",
    "this softening appears to be required for an accurate description of different collective modes having different neutron - to - proton ratios . as a result ,",
    "the fsugold effective interaction predicts neutron star radii that are too large and a maximum stellar mass that is too small  @xcite .",
    "the indiana university - florida state university ( iufsu ) interaction , is a new relativistic parameter set , derived from fsugold .",
    "it is simultaneously constrained by the properties of finite nuclei , their collective excitations and the neutron star properties by adjusting two of the parameters of the theory - the neutron skin thickness of @xmath21 and the maximum neutron star mass  @xcite . as a result",
    "the new effective interaction softens the eos at intermediate densities and stiffens the eos at high density .",
    "as it stands now , the new iufsu interaction reproduces the binding energies and charge radii of closed - shell nuclei , various nuclear giant ( monopole and dipole ) resonances , the low - density behavior of pure neutron matter , the high - density behavior of the symmetric nuclear matter and the mass - radius relationship of neutron stars . whether this new eos can accommodate the hyperons inside the compact stars , with the severe constraints imposed by the recent observations of @xmath22 pulsars , needs to be explored . in this work",
    "we plan to make a detailed study of such a possibility . for this purpose",
    "we have extended the iufsu interaction by including the full baryon octet .",
    "a new eos is constructed to investigate the neutron star properties with hyperons .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly discuss the model used and the resulting eos . in the next section we use this eos to look at static and rotating star properties .",
    "we give a brief summary in section 4 .",
    "one of the possible approaches to describe neutron star matter is to adopt an rmf model subject to @xmath2 equilibrium and charge neutrality . for our investigation of nucleons and hyperons in the compact star matter",
    "we choose the full standard baryon octet as well as electrons and muons .",
    "contribution from neutrinos are not taken into account assuming that they can escape freely from the system . in this model ,",

    "1a and 1b one can generally conclude that the inclusion of @xmath25 meson makes the eos stiffer , however , hyperonic eos is much softer than the usual nuclear matter eos .",

    "the appearance of @xmath29 is also pushed to higher density compared to the case of an attractive potential .",
    "when @xmath25 is included in the system @xmath100 and @xmath78 appear with @xmath29 for @xmath99 mev ( fig .",

    "@xmath3 s are no longer bound to matter and the effective mesonic interaction becomes more and more repulsive with increasing @xmath79 .",

    "[ pf2]d ) , we see that as a result of the combined effects of inclusion of @xmath25 and repulsive potentials , only the @xmath29 and @xmath78 are present in the system .",
    "from both figures [ pf1 ] and [ pf2 ] , we see that , inclusion of @xmath25 meson decreases the density of hyperons .",
    "since @xmath25 is a strange particle , further strangeness is suppressed and as a result the hyperon densities are reduced compared to the `` @xmath102 '' case .",
    "in this section we are going to discuss the properties of static and rotating axisymmetric stars using the eos which we have studied in the last section . the eos without @xmath25 meson is softer compared to that with @xmath25 meson .",
    "so we do not discuss the eos without @xmath25 as it results in less maximum mass .",
    "the stationary , axisymmetric space - time used to model the compact stars are defined through the metric @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath24 and @xmath23 are the gravitational potentials which depend on r and @xmath113 only .    in this work",
    "we adopt the procedure of komatsu  @xcite to look into the observable properties of static and rotating stars .",
    "einstein s equations for the three gravitational potentials @xmath112 , @xmath24 and @xmath23 can be solved using green s function technique .",
    "the fourth potential @xmath111 can be determined using these three potentials .",
    "once these potentials are determined one can calculate all the observable quantities using those .",
    "the solution of the potentials and hence the determination of physical quantities is numerically quite an involved process . for this purpose the `` rns '' code  @xcite",
    "is used in this work .",
    "this code , developed by stergoilas , is very efficient in calculating the rotating star observables .",
    "we discuss the properties of static stars first . in fig .",
    "[ static ] we have plotted the mass - radius curves of static stars using the eos with `` @xmath103 '' . a plot for the pure nuclear matter case",

    "the maximum mass of pure nuclear matter star in the static case is @xmath114 with a radius of @xmath115 km .",
    "we have found that the mass of hyperonic star becomes maximum for @xmath116 mev and @xmath117 mev . hence in fig .",
    "[ static ] and fig .",
    "[ mr3 ] we have shown the effect of these potentials on the maximum mass of neutron stars by fixing one of the potentials at + 40 mev and varying the other .",

    "i.e. _ in fig .",
    "[ static]b , it is the other way round . from fig .",
    "[ static]a one can see that the maximum mass of the star increases with @xmath120 . for @xmath121",

    "this is a reflection of the eos shown in fig .",
    "[ eos]a , which shows that the eos becomes stiffer with increase in @xmath120 .",
    "however , as seen from fig .",
    "[ static]b , the maximum mass of static stars is insensitive to @xmath125 , which should be obvious from fig .",
    "[ eos]b as the eos is independent of the cascade potential . furthermore , from fig .",
    "[ pf2]d one can see that there is no cascade present in the medium",
    ". so the insensitivity of the eos and hence the maximum mass , towards the cascade potential is expected .",
    "one should note that the maximum mass we obtain for the static stars is less than the observed mass of psr j@xmath0 .",
    "so the static stars with hyperons in the iufsu parameter set can not incorporate a maximum mass @xmath22 .",
    "this result is consistent with the findings in ref .",
    "however , since both of the observed @xmath22 stars are pulsars , it would be a better idea to compare the observations with results from the rotating stars , which we do in the next part .    in fig .",

    ", we see that the maximum mass for the rotating case also increases with @xmath79 as we go towards more positive values of this potential . at @xmath135",

    ", we see that a fair amount of hyperons are present in the core .",
    "there are @xmath29 , @xmath78 and @xmath101 present .",
    "another interesting observation is that near the core , the density of @xmath29 is much more compared to that of protons and it continues up to a distance of about 5 km from the center .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the static and rotating axisymmetric stars with hyperons using iufsu model .",
    "the original fsugold parameter set has been very successful in describing the properties of finite nuclei . with the discovery of",
    "highly massive neutron stars the reliability of this model was questioned .",
    "it was then revised in the form of iufsu to accommodate such highly massive stars leaving the low density finite nuclear properties unchanged . in this work",
    "we have studied this new parameter set in the context of the possibility of having a hyperonic core in such massive stars .",
    "we have included the full octet of baryons in iufsu .",
    "the eos gets softened due to the inclusion of hyperons whereas the inclusion of the @xmath25 meson makes the eos stiffer .",
    "we have also investigated the influence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 potentials on the eos .    for static stars with hyperonic core",
    "we get a maximum mass of @xmath122 .",
    "so iufsu with hyperons can not reproduce the observed mass of static stars . however , as the observed @xmath22 neutron stars are both pulsars , we compare the results in the rotating limit . in the keplerian limit",
    "we get a maximum mass of @xmath137 , which is within the 3@xmath6 limit of the mass of psr j@xmath0 and 1@xmath6 limit of the earlier observation of psr j@xmath1 .",
    "we have looked at the particle densities inside the star having the maximum mass and found that a considerable amount of hyperons are present near the core .",
    "therefore , our results are consistent with the recent observations of highly massive pulsars confirming the presence of hyperons in the core of such massive neutron stars .",
    "to conclude , iufsu model , which reproduces the properties of finite nuclei quite successfully also reproduces the recent observations of @xmath140 stars , in case of stars having exotic core and rotating in the keplerian limit .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether such a star can hold a quark core .",

    "<S> the recent discoveries of massive neutron stars , such as psr j@xmath0 and psr j@xmath1 , have raised questions about the existence of exotic matter such as hyperons in the neutron star core . the validity of many established equations of states ( eos s ) like the gm1 and fsugold are also questioned . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the existence of hyperonic matter in the central regions of massive neutron stars using relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory with the recently proposed iufsu model . </S>",
    "<S> the iufsu model is extended by including hyperons to study the neutron star in @xmath2 equilibrium . the effect of different hyperonic potentials , namely @xmath3 and @xmath4 potentials , on the eos and hence the maximum mass of neutron stars has been studied . </S>",
    "<S> we have also considered the effect of stellar rotation since the observed massive stars are pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that a maximum mass of @xmath5 , which is within the 3@xmath6 limit of the observed mass of psr j@xmath0 , can be obtained for rotating stars , with certain choices of the hyperonic potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the said star contains a fair amount of hyperons near the core . </S>",
