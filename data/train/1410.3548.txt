    "spontaneous collapse and consequent quantum revival  [ ] occurs in the long term dynamics of an injected wave - packet in systems with non - equidistant energy levels due to quantum interference .",
    "it has been investigated in a wide class of systems [ ] and the phenomenon of wave packet collapse , revivals , and fractional revivals have been observed experimentally in a number of atomic and molecular systems [ ] .",
    "however this phenomena of purely quantum mechanical in origin , is relatively less explored in condensed matter systems with discrete landau energy levels , despite the fact that unlike _ zitterbewegung _ in solid state systems [ ] these oscillations are large and slow enough for an experimental probe .",
    "_ zitterbewegung _ and wave - packet dynamics in several 2d condensed matter systems with landau - levels have been explored earlier [ ] , but the phenomena of spontaneous collapse and revival has largely gone unaddressed [ ] . motivated by the unified description of _ zitterbewegung _ in solid state systems in refs .",
    "[ ] , in this article we present an exact and unified description of the quantum wave - packet dynamics and the phenomena of collapse and quantum revival in various two dimensional ( 2d ) solid state systems .",
    "initially when a well localized wave packet is injected into a 2d system with non - equidistant landau energy levels , it undergoes cyclotron motion and evolves quasi - classically with periodicity @xmath0 , for a number of cycles , with its probability density spreading around the quasi - classical trajectory .",
    "non - equidistant nature of the discrete energy spectrum then leads to destructive quantum interference and consequently the collapse of the wave - packet .",
    "the ( almost ) collapsed wave - packet regain their initial waveform and oscillate again with the quasi - classical periodicity on a much longer time scale known as revival time ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "in addition , there is also the possibility of fractional revivals which occurs at rational fraction of the revival time @xmath2 when the initial wave - packet evolves into a collection of mini wave - packets resembling the waveform of the injected wave - packet [ ] .    in this article",
    "we consider several 2d systems , which can be classified into two categories based on the dynamics of the charge carriers : schrdinger - like ( non - relativistic dynamics described by the schrdinger equation ) and dirac - like fermionic systems [ ] ( relativistic dynamics described by the dirac equation ) .",
    "the so called ` schrdinger - like ' materials include 2d electron / hole gas ( 2deg/2dhg ) trapped at the interface of iii - v semiconductor hetero - structures , like algaas - gaas , and these typically have a linear [ ] or cubic spin orbit interaction ( soi ) terms [ ] in addition to the parabolic dispersion relation .",
    "the so called ` dirac - like ' materials have a relativistic dispersion relation and typical examples include graphene [ ] and other crystals like silicene [ ] , germanene [ ] , monolayer transition metal group - vi dichalcogenides mx@xmath3 ( and ) etc . [ ] which generally have a honeycomb lattice structure .",
    "dirac materials also have suppressed electron scattering and tunable electronic properties which make them very interesting from an application point of view .    for the present study",

    "note that the value for band gap plays an important role in determining the relevant timescales .",
    "in particular the revival time for mos@xmath3 is quite large as compared to other dirac - like materials due to its large band - gap .",
    "however the band - gap is not a fixed quantity , and in some materials it can be varied by the application of a transverse electric fields ( as in silicene ) or by doping ( as in transition metal dichalcogenides ) .",
    "we present a unified treatment of wave - packet dynamics in various 2d systems , in presence of a transverse magnetic field , and the associated phenomena of spontaneous collapse and long term quantum revival of the wave - packet .",
    "in particular we focus on a minimum uncertainty gaussian wave packet and obtain exact expressions for the expectation values of the position and velocity operators for a variety of 2d materials , in addition to the various timescales associated with the phenomena of spontaneous collapse and quantum revival .    for any system with discrete and non - equidistant landau level spectrum injecting an initial electron wave packet which is peaked ( centered ) around some landau level , we find that the wave packet initially evolves quasi - classically and oscillate with a period of @xmath0 ( the cyclotron time - period ) .",
    "however at larger times , the wave packet eventually spreads and quantum interference between the different landau level components of the wave - function leads to its ` collapse ' , and at even longer times , that are multiples ( or rational fractions ) of @xmath2 , quantum interference results in long - term revival of the wave packet , and the electron position and velocity regains its initial amplitude  again undergoing quasiclassical oscillatory motion .    to summarize finally , we present a unified and exact analytical treatment of wave - packet dynamics in various 2d spin - orbit coupled schrdinger systems and dirac - like materials . as expected on general grounds , for any system with phenomenon of spontaneous collapse and quantum revival .",
