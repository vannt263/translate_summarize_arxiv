    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 depends on the direct potential interactions between the colloidal particles and on the indirect hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) mediated by the suspending solvent .",

    "their experimental findings for @xmath5 have been compared with recent theoretical calculations by jones @xcite , designed for hard sphere suspensions .",
    "these calculations include also the approximative evaluation of the coefficient of the quadratic term in the virial expansion of @xmath5 in powers of the volume fraction @xmath1 .",
    "the agreement between theoretical and experimental results for @xmath5 is found to be satisfactory .",
    "moreover , the small differences observed in the magnitude of the first and second virial coefficients are suggested to be partially due to residual electrostatic interactions , which are left over if the ionic strength of the added electrolyte is not large enough to completely screen the coulomb repulsion @xcite .",

    "we discuss now the dependence of @xmath178 on the amount od added electrolyte . in this context",
    ", it should be noted that most `` hard  sphere '' suspensions studied so far by ddls are in fact suspensions of charged particles with a large amount of salt added to screen the electrostatic repulsion ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our results for @xmath134 for various amounts of added 11 electrolyte ranging from @xmath128 to @xmath179 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ addedsalt ] .",
    "it is noted from this figure that addition of electrolyte leads to a decrease of @xmath77 , i.e. the rotational diffusion of the particles becomes more affected by the hi with increasing ionic strength .",
    "this is due to the fact that the system gradually transforms with increasing @xmath119 into a hard  sphere  like dispersion .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath77 can be qualitatively explained on the basis of the ehs model by noting for increasing @xmath119 that the effective radius @xmath180 decreases and eventually approaches the physical diameter @xmath32 for very large @xmath119 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ hrsinehs ] ) that @xmath77 becomes smaller with decreasing @xmath181 .",
    "going beyond the ehs model , we can learn more about the ionic strength dependence of @xmath77 by considering fig .",
    "[ saltgvonr ] , which shows rmsa results for @xmath10 for a suspension of volume fraction @xmath182 and various amounts of added electrolyte .",
    "the @xmath10 of the deionized suspension has pronounced oscillations , indicating strong particle correlations .",
    "these oscillations become damped out as electrolyte is added , and the peak position @xmath145 is shifted towards smaller values . for the system under consideration ,",
    "very large amounts of electrolyte ( i.e. @xmath183 ) are needed to reach the hard  sphere limit , where the rmsa@xmath10 becomes equal to the corresponding percus ",
    "yevick solution @xcite .",
    "consider , e.g. , the case @xmath179 in fig .",
    "[ saltgvonr ] , which corresponds to @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "the value of the pair potential at contact distance is still large enough to create a small but non  negligible correlation hole with zero probability of finding another particle .",
    "in fact , it is well known @xcite that the value of @xmath77 , and hence the value of @xmath5 , is extremely sensitive to the behaviour of the radial distribution function near touching .",
    "this is clearly seen from the fast decay of the two  body scalar mobility function @xmath136 $ ] shown in fig .",
    "[ saltgvonr ] .",
    "the scaling property @xmath186 is invalid for larger amounts of electrolyte , when the particle diameter becomes a second physically relevant length scale besides the mean particle distance @xmath149 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath134 at small @xmath1 changes then gradually with increasing @xmath119 from a quadratic to a linear @xmath1dependence .",
    "at very large @xmath187 , @xmath10 exhibits only tiny changes in its form when @xmath1 is increased .",
    "hence @xmath77 gets more and more independent of @xmath1 , and @xmath188 becomes linear in @xmath1 .",
    "a deficiency of our calculations is the fact that we do not obtain the exact hard  sphere result @xmath189 in the limit @xmath190 .",
    "instead the limiting value @xmath191 is reached , since we use a series expansion up to terms of order @xmath13 in calculating @xmath82 . however",
    ", this truncated expansion is sufficiently good for charge  stabilized suspensions with moderate amounts of added electrolyte , where @xmath192 holds ( cf .",
    "in the present work , we have investigated the combined effects of electrostatic interactions and hydrodynamic interactions on the short  time rotational diffusion coefficient @xmath5 in monodisperse suspensions of charge  stabilized colloidal particles .",
    "on the basis of the one  component macrofluid model , which neglects electroviscous effects arising from the dynamic distortion of the electric double layer around a particle , we have calculated @xmath129 for various systems as a function of volume fraction , effective particle charge , and ionic strength . for these calculations we have used a rooted cluster expansion derived by degiorgio et .",
    "@xcite , combined with far  field expansions of the two  body and three  body mobility functions .",
    "we have given evidence that this is a good and well founded approximation in case of charge  stabilized suspensions , as long as the amount of added electrolyte is not very large .",
    "the short  time rotational diffusion of charged particles is less affected by the hi than the rotational diffusion of the uncharged ones . for deionized suspensions of highly charged particles",
    "we have found a quadratic volume fraction dependence of the form @xmath193 , with a coefficient @xmath194 , which is nearly system independent .",
    "the quadratic @xmath1dependence extends up to rather large volume fractions due to the fact that the leading three  body term is essentially cancelled by the two  body contributions of @xmath159 .",
    "we have further shown that the qualitative behaviour of @xmath77 can be understood in the framework of a simplified ehs model .",
    "incidently , dilute deionized suspensions are peculiar also with respect to the @xmath1dependence of the translational short  time self  diffusion coefficient @xmath195 .",
    "for this quantity , one obtains a non  analytic concentration dependence of the form @xmath196 , with @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "the fractal exponent @xmath198 follows also from the ehs model applied to translational self  diffusion .",
    "upon addition of salt , the quadratic @xmath1dependence of @xmath5 changes gradually to a @xmath1dependence typical for hard spheres , where the term linear in @xmath1 dominates for @xmath99 .",
    "very large amounts of salt are required for the systems investigated in this work to reach the hard  sphere limit .",
    "this finding is due to the fast decay of the two  body mobility functions with increasing @xmath86 , which renders the two  body term @xmath82 extremly sensitive to distances close to the contact distance of two particles .",
    "degiorgio et .",
    "@xcite report a small increase of the measured @xmath5 of hard spheres at the freezing transition where @xmath199 .",
    "the theoretical argument to explain this enhancement is the slightly increased free volume per particle in the crystal phase .",
    "the resulting slightly increased interparticle distance turns the hi somewhat less important .",
    "we expect that a similar effect should occur for the freezing transition in charge  stabilized suspensions , which occurs at much smaller @xmath1 . in our calculations",
    "we have used pair distribution functions @xmath10 calculated with a method ( rmsa ) designed only for the fluid phase .",
    "therefore , we can not account for the effect of the freezing transition on the short  time rotational diffusion .",
    "nevertheless , we anticipate that our calculations give reasonable results even for the colloidal crystal phase , since our arguments concerning the scaling property of the peak position @xmath145 of @xmath10 should also apply to the crystal phase . beside",
    "that we have shown that @xmath77 is not very sensitive on the details of the shape of @xmath10 near @xmath145 .",
    "for these reasons , we expect only a small decrease of the coefficient @xmath4 at the freezing transition .",
    "therefore we have shown in this paper calculations of @xmath77 up to moderatly large @xmath1 , although we know from the hansen ",
    "verlet criterion that the systems studied here should be crystalline already at small @xmath1 .    to our knowledge",
    "no experimental or computer simulation data of @xmath5 for deionized charge  stabilized suspensions have been published so far . because of the interesting differences in the rotational diffusion between suspensions of charged and uncharged particles , it would be worth to check the general predictions of our calculations against experiments and computer simulations .",
    "we finally mention that recent ddls measurements of @xmath5 in deionized suspensions of charged fluorinated polymer particles , initiated by our work , compare favorable with our calculations @xcite .",
