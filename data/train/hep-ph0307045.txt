    "in this contribution we extend the study in ref .",
    "@xcite of an extension of the standard model in which a real scalar @xmath0 triplet with zero hypercharge is added to the usual scalar @xmath0 doublet . for details",
    "the scalar potential of the model in terms of the usual standard model higgs , @xmath1 , and the new triplet , @xmath2 , reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the expansion of the field components is @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the goldstone boson which is eaten by the @xmath8 .",
    "the model violates custodial symmetry at tree level giving a prediction of @xmath9 for the @xmath10-parameter . in the neutral higgs sector",
    "we have two cp - even states which mix with angle @xmath11 .",
    "the mass eigenstates @xmath12 are defined by @xmath13 in the charged higgs sector the mass eigenstates @xmath14 are @xmath15 the @xmath16 are the goldstone bosons corresponding to @xmath17 and , at tree level , the mixing angle is @xmath18 .",
    "the precision electroweak data constrain @xmath19 to be smaller than about @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "in ref . @xcite the beta functions for the couplings",
    "were calculated using the one - loop effective potential @xcite with @xmath21 renormalization in t  hooft - landau gauge and the anomalous dimensions for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the results read @xmath24 in the gauge and top quark sector the beta functions for the @xmath25 , @xmath26 and yukawa couplings are the same as in the standard model and only the @xmath0 coupling is modified due to the extra higgs triplet in the adjoint representation , i.e. @xmath27 .    working with the tree - level effective potential with couplings evolved using the one - loop @xmath19 and @xmath11 functions we are able to resum the leading logarithms to all orders in the effective potential . to carry out the rg analysis we first introduce the parameter @xmath28 , related to @xmath29 through @xmath30 .",
    "we perform evolution starting at @xmath31 .",
    "the rg equations are coupled differential equations in the set @xmath32 .",
    "we choose rather to use the set @xmath33 .    within the accuracy to which we are working",
    ", the values of the couplings at @xmath31 can be obtained from the input set using the appropriate tree - level expressions . making use of the vacuum conditions and the notation @xmath34 and @xmath35 we can write the tree level masses as @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "inverting these relations we can fix the @xmath31 boundary conditions for the subsequent evolution . to ensure that the system remains in a local minimum we impose the condition that the squared masses should remain positive .",
    "we also impose that the couplings remain perturbative , insisting that @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we run the evolution from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , with @xmath43 tev .",
    "in the non - decoupling regime the triplet can not be arbitrarily heavy .",
    "for this case in fig .  1 we show the range of higgs masses allowed when there is no mixing in the neutral higgs sector , @xmath44 , for @xmath45 .",
    "such a value is interesting because it allows a rather heavy lightest higgs ( e.g. for @xmath46  gev and for @xmath47  gev )  @xcite .",
    "the strong correlation between the @xmath48 and @xmath49 masses arises in order that @xmath50 remain perturbative .",
    "the upper bound on the triplet higgs masses ( @xmath51  gev ) comes about from the perturbativity of @xmath52 whilst that on @xmath53 ( @xmath54  gev ) comes from the perturbativity of @xmath55 .",
    "the hole at low masses is due to vacuum stability .",
    "[ b004g0 ]    the @xmath56 case has been considered in ref . @xcite and the bounds are similar to the no - mixing case . in the maximal mixing case of @xmath57 the bounds are more democratic .",
    "the largeness of @xmath58 can be arranged either by tuning @xmath59 or by having small enough @xmath55 and @xmath60 . in the former case ,",
    "all masses are approximately degenerate . in the latter case , which corresponds to light masses ,",
    "the degeneracy is lifted .",
    "the bounds for @xmath61 are very similar to those for @xmath62 on interchanging @xmath49 and @xmath53 . for @xmath63 and small @xmath11 but away from the decoupling regime",
    "the allowed regions are very similar to those for @xmath64 . for larger @xmath11 ,",
    "the mass bounds are again as for larger @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath65 there is no doublet - triplet mixing and no bound on the triplet mass .",
    "this is a special case of the more general decoupling scenario , which occurs when @xmath66 , where the triplet decouples from the doublet . for small mixing angles ,",
    "the triplet higgs has mass squared @xmath67 and it is possible to have @xmath68 by keeping @xmath69 large . in this case @xmath70",
    "this is the decoupling limit in which the triplet mass lies far above the mass of the doublet and the low energy model looks identical to the standard model .",
    "we have computed the one - loop beta functions for the scalar couplings in an extension to the standard model which contains an additional real triplet higgs . through considerations of perturbativity of the couplings and vacuum stability we have identified the allowed masses of the higgs bosons in the non - decoupling regime @xcite . in the decoupling regime",
    ", the model tends to resemble the standard model .",
    "the near degeneracy of the triplet higgs masses ensures that , at least for small @xmath11 , the quantum corrections to the @xmath71 parameter are negligible ( the @xmath72 parameter vanishing since the triplet has zero hypercharge ) @xcite .",
    "this means that the lightest higgs boson can be heavy as a result of the compensation arising from the explicit tree - level violation of custodial symmetry and it is possible to be in a regime where all the higgs bosons are heavy without any dramatic deviation from the physics of the standard model .",
