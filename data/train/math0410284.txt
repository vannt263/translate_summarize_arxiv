    "this paper deals with constructive methods to seek critical points which are not minimizers for functionals defined on hilbert spaces . the existence of such critical points may be detected from the topological features of the sublevels , under some compactness conditions .",
    "the purpose of this work is to give a constructive version of the ambrosetti - rabinowitz mountain pass theorem ( see  @xcite ) , which is one of the most useful abstract critical point theorems and that has found relevant applications in solving nonlinear boundary value problems .",

    "the efficiency of our algorithm consists in the low number of steepest descent flow lines to be determined to obtain a good approximation of a critical point of mountain pass type ; this fact makes the method particularly fit for problems in high dimensions such as those coming from the discretization of nonlinear boundary value problems in infinite dimensional spaces .",
    "moreover , compared with the usual newton s method , our algorithm has two main advantages : it always converges and it does not need an a priori good initial guess .    for some numerical applications of algorithms  [ alg:1b ] and  [ alg:2 ] we refer the reader to chapter 2 of  @xcite , where such algorithms are applied to the action functional associated to the @xmath0-body problem with simple or double choreography constraint respectively .",
