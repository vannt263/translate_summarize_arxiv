    "phojet describes the production of strings . for the string decay",
    "it calls pythia version 6.412  @xcite . for a few special cases we found it necessary to change the pythia fragmentation .",
    "these were done in the dpmjet part , leaving the pythia code itself untouched .    as we use the full program we will refer below just to dpmjet - iii .",
    "we now outline its main additions .    comparing dpmjet - iii to rhic data",
    "it was learned that something had to be done to decrease the particle density . as the strings are quite dense in impact parameter space interactions between strings are plausible .",
    "the expected percolation was modeled as fusion of close hadronic chains implemented in dpmjet - iii  @xcite in 2004 .",
    "the obtained reduction was very essential for central collisions of heavy ions , but fusion also changes the particle production in very high energy p ",
    "p collisions when the number of contributing chains obtained by a glauber / eikonal formalism gets sizable .",
    "rhic and fermilab data also contain interesting information about particle antiparticle ratio s  @xcite .",
    "for the baryon / antibaryon distribution the string fusion mentioned above can be significant ( p.e .",
    "two quark - antiquark strings can fuse to a diquark - antidiquark string yielding baryons and antibaryons ) .    in the diquark string decay used in pythia one",
    "observes a dip in the ratio of the @xmath2 spectra not seen in the data .",
    "a solution of the problem is to include a small contribution of diquark - diantiquark mesons production in the first rank so that @xmath3 can appear in the second rank .",
    "the idea is that such tetra - quark mesons are always produced but decay too fast to be identified in mass plots .",
    "the lhc experiments did compare dpmjet - iii to particle production at lhc  energies , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there were some successful predictions of dpmjet .",
    "however , lhc experiments found that around 7 tev the multiplicity rises faster with energy than predicted by dpmjet - iii .    in order to make the program usable for ongoing data analyses at lhc energies we adjusted the program to improve the agreement with available experimental results .",
    "we allowed for an energy - dependence of string decay parameters .",
    "no differentiation between softer and harder strings was attempted .",
    "the new results of this modified version will be reported in section 3 and 4 .",
    "there are essentially three additional modifications of dpmjet - iii implemented in order to get better agreement with lhc data on particle production in p  p collisions .",
    "( 1 ) : :    the first modification is connected to a problem with collision    scaling known since 2004  @xcite .",
    "dpmjet - iii uses an eikonal formalism    to determine the size of various multiple scattering contributions    @xmath4 where    @xmath5 is the number of chains and    @xmath6 is the regge intercept depending on the    diquark , valence quark or sea quark nature of the forward / backward    parton of @xmath7-th chain .",
    "let us consider the forward    direction .",
    "for each such configuration the attributed energy fractions    @xmath8 to these partons are then chosen with a    factorizing structure function of the form :    @xmath9    in which the energy available for a scattering process depends on the    reminder .",
    "there are two kinds of chains in dpmjet .",
    "hard chains    produced by hard collisions of partons from the colliding hadrons    ( typically large @xmath10 ) and soft chains representing    soft hadron production in the collisions . in the factorizing formalism    soft processes affect the energy sampled in hard processes .",
    "+    this turned out to be too simple .",
    "experiments  @xcite gave evidence    for collision scaling in not too central scattering    processes . collision scaling means , that exactly as many    hard chains are produced as predicted by considering just hard    collisions .",
    "+    to correct for the missing collision scaling an additional parameter    was introduced  @xcite which increases the number of hard collisions    in such a way that collision scaling is obtained .",
    "we here adjusted    these constants to the lhc data .",
    "( 2 ) : :    lhc experiments @xcite found that the produced hadron    multiplicity rises with energy somewhat faster than the model .",
    "to    obtain this faster rise with collision energy one needs to introduce    energy - dependent parameters .",
    "this is not unreasonable .",
    "the time scale    of the initial scattering is inversely proportional to the energy .",
    "this causes a more localized string and a widening of the    @xmath10distribution of the string ends which was    observed as on contribution to the multiplicity dependence of the    average transverse momentum @xmath11 .",
    "there are of    course many different parameter in pythia which can be tuned in an    energy - dependent way .",
    "+    the solution which was adopted for the moment is not to search for a    suitably , possibly theoretically plausible energy - dependence but just    adjust parameters .",
