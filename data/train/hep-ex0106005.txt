    "precise measurements of the lifetimes of charm meson weak decays are important for understanding qcd in both perturbative and nonperturbative regimes . for mesons a joint expansion in heavy quark effective theory and perturbative qcd parameters treated through",
    "the third order in the heavy quark mass shows a term including non - spectator w - annihilation as well as pauli interference .",
    "the resulting non - leptonic decay rate differences between w - exchange in @xmath9 and w - annihilation in @xmath8 produce lifetime differences of order 10 - 20 % @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 lifetime  @xcite was dominated by the measurements from e687 collaboration ( 0.475 @xmath11 0.020 @xmath11 0.007 ps )  @xcite .",
    "recently new precision measurements of the @xmath8 lifetime have been made by the e791 collaboration ( 0.518 @xmath11 0.014 @xmath11 0.007 ps )  @xcite and the cleo collaboration ( 486.3 @xmath11 15.0 @xmath12 fs )  @xcite .",
    "both groups have taken advantage of improved precision in the @xmath13 lifetime measurement to report new results for the @xmath14 lifetime ratio of @xmath15  @xcite and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "their average is 7.4 @xmath17 from unity , emphasizing the large difference in w contributions to @xmath8 and @xmath9 decays .    in this letter",
    "we report the results of a new measurement of the @xmath8 lifetime based on data from the hadroproduction experiment selex ( e781 ) at fermilab .",
    "the measurement is based on about 1000 fully reconstructed decays into @xmath18 from a sample of 15.3 @xmath19 hadronic triggers .",
    "the selex detector at fermilab is a 3-stage magnetic spectrometer .",
    "the negatively charged 600 gev/@xmath1 beam contains nearly equal fractions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the positive beam contains 92% protons .",
    "beam particles are identified by a transition radiation detector .",
    "the spectrometer was designed to study charm production in the forward hemisphere with good mass and decay vertex resolution for charm momenta in the range 100 - 500 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "five interaction targets ( 2 cu and 3 c ) had a total target thickess of 4.2% @xmath22 for protons .",
    "the targets are spaced by 1.5 cm .",
    "downstream of the targets are 20 silicon planes with a strip pitch of 20 - 25 @xmath23 m oriented in x ,  y ,  u and v views .",
    "the scattered - particle spectrometers have momentum cutoffs of 2.5 gev/@xmath1 and 15 gev/@xmath1 respectively .",
    "a ring - imaging cerenkov detector ( rich )  @xcite , filled with neon at room temperature and pressure , provides single track ring radius resolution of 1.4% and 2@xmath17 @xmath24 separation up to about 165 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "a layout of the spectrometer can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the charm trigger is very loose .",
    "it requires a valid beam track , at least 4 charged secondaries in the forward 150 mrad cone , and two hodoscope hits after the second bending magnet from tracks of charge opposite to that of the beam .",
    "we triggered on about 1/3 of all inelastic interactions .",
    "a computational filter linked pwc tracks having momenta @xmath25 gev/@xmath1 to hits in the vertex silicon and made a full reconstruction of primary and secondary vertices in the event .",
    "events consistent with only a primary vertex are not saved .",
    "about 1/8 of all triggers are written to tape , for a final sample of about @xmath26 events .    in the full analysis",
    "the vertex reconstruction was repeated with tracks of all momenta .",
    "again , only events inconsistent with having a single primary vertex were considered .",
    "the rich detector identified charged tracks above 25 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "results reported here come from a preliminary reconstruction through the data , using a production code optimized for speed , not ultimate efficiency .",
    "the simulated reconstruction efficiency of any charmed state is constant at about 40% for @xmath27 where @xmath28 of selex events lie .    to separate the signal from the noncharm background",
    "we require that : ( i ) the spatial separation @xmath29 between the reconstructed production and decay vertices exceeds 8 times the combined error @xmath30 , ( ii ) each decay track , extrapolated to the primary vertex @xmath31 position , must miss by a transverse distance length @xmath32 2.5 times its error @xmath33 , ( iii ) the secondary vertex must lie outside any target by at least 0.05 cm and ( iv ) decays must occur within a fiducial region .",
    "there are @xmath34 events @xmath35 candidates , each having two rich - identified kaons and a pion , for which no particle identification is required .",
    "we divide them into three decay channels : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and other kk@xmath21 .",
    "the resonant mass window for the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) was @xmath38 mev/@xmath39 ( @xmath40 mev/@xmath39 ) .",
    "@xmath41 misidentification causes a reflection of @xmath42 under the @xmath8 peak .",
    "we limit the maximum kaon momentum to 160 gev/@xmath1 to reduce misidentification in the rich . to evaluate the shape of this background we use the @xmath43 sample that passes all the cuts listed above and lies within @xmath11 15 mev/@xmath44 of the @xmath45 mass .",
    "we formed the invariant mass distribution of these events when one pion is interpreted as a kaon . at most one of the two possible reflections per event",
    "falls into the @xmath35 mass window .",
    "the reflected mass distribution was fit by a polynomial function rising at 1925 mev/@xmath44 and decreasing to zero at large invariant mass .",
    "dividing this distribution by the number of @xmath42 events gives us the contribution per mass bin for each misidentified @xmath42 in the @xmath35 sample .",
    "we count the misidentified @xmath42 in the @xmath8 sample by fitting the @xmath35 mass distribution within @xmath11 20 mev/@xmath44 interval around the @xmath35 mass with the sum of a gaussian signal , a linear background shape estimated from the sidebands and the @xmath42 shape with variable normalization .",
    "the resultant misidentified @xmath42 contribution to the @xmath35 mass distribution is shown as the hatched areas in fig .",
    "1(a ) ,  ( b ) .",
    "the fit gives @xmath46 and @xmath47 misidentified @xmath42 events in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 decay mode , respectively ( the error quoted is statistical only ) . the rich kaon identification is a very powerful tool for rejecting @xmath42 contamination ; @xmath37 decay kinematics further reduces particle identification confusion in the @xmath50 channel .    to estimate yields",
    ", we subtracted the sideband background and @xmath42 contamination as evaluated above from the total number of events in the signal region .",
    "we find 430 @xmath11 24 @xmath51 and 330 @xmath11 19 @xmath49 events .",
    "a gaussian fit to the combined data shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) ,  ( b ) gives a mass of @xmath52 mev@xmath53 and @xmath54 mev@xmath53 .",
    "note that these fitted yields are not used as constraints in the lifetime fit , as discussed below .",
    "the average longitudinal error @xmath55 on the primary and secondary vertices is 270 @xmath23 m and 500 @xmath23 m , which gives a combined error of 570 @xmath23 m . in the @xmath8 sample ,",
    "the average momentum is 215 gev/@xmath1 , corresponding to a time resolution of 18 fs , about @xmath56 of @xmath57 .",
    "because bin - smearing effects are small , we used a binned maximum likelihood fitting technique to determine the @xmath8 lifetime .",
    "the fit was applied to a reduced proper time distribution , @xmath58 where m is the known charm mass  @xcite , @xmath4 the reconstructed momentum , @xmath29 the measured vertex separation and @xmath59 the minimum @xmath29 for each event to pass all the imposed selection cuts .",
    "@xmath59 is determined event - by - event , along with the acceptance , by the procedure described below .",
    "we fitted all events with @xmath60 fs in the mass range @xmath61 gev@xmath53 , @xmath62 from the @xmath8 central mass value .    to evaluate the mean lifetime we used a maximum likelihood method .",
    "the probability density was performed by the function :    @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65    the function is the sum of a term for the @xmath8 exponential decay corrected by the acceptance function @xmath66 plus a background function @xmath67 consisting of a single exponential plus a constant to account for a flat background extending to large proper time .",
    "its parameters were determined from the @xmath68 distribution from the @xmath8 sidebands .",
    "it also includes a term for the @xmath42 exponential decay normalized to the number of misidentified events in the signal region .",
    "the @xmath69 lifetime used in the fit is 1051 @xmath70 fs  @xcite .",
    "the mass range of the sideband background windows , @xmath71 gev@xmath53 and @xmath72 gev@xmath53 was twice the signal mass window .",
    "we defined asymmetric sidebands to avoid the influence of @xmath73 , and we excluded the @xmath74 mass region .",
    "the four parameters are : @xmath57 ( @xmath8 lifetime ) , @xmath75 ( background lifetime ) , @xmath76 ( background fraction in the signal region ) and @xmath77 ( background splitting function ) .",
    "@xmath78 is the total number of events in the signal region after @xmath42 contamination subtraction .",
    "the proper - time - dependent acceptance @xmath66 is independent of spectrometer features after the first magnet , e.g. , rich efficiency and tracking efficiency .",
    "these efficiencies affect only the overall number of events detected .",
    "the proper time distribution of these events depends crucially on vertex reconstruction . to evaluate @xmath66",
    "we reanalyze each @xmath79 @xmath35 event after moving it to a large set of different proper times @xmath80 .",
    "only the longitudinal position of the charm decay point and the axial orientation of the 3-body decay vectors are changed @xcite .",
    "a reanalyzed event is accepted if it passes the same cuts as those applied to the data .",
    "the minimum flight path after which an event is accepted defines @xmath59 for this event .",
    "this method is independent of details of the true @xmath81 or transverse momentum distributions @xcite .",
    "2 shows the overall fits to the data distributions as a function of reduced proper time for @xmath82 and @xmath83 decay modes .",
    "it also shows the acceptance @xmath84 , which differs significantly from unity only after 4 lifetimes where statistics are limited .",
    "table 1 summarizes the lifetime results for the two modes analyzed : @xmath85 ; and @xmath86 .",
    "the uncertainties are statistical only , evaluated where @xmath87 increases by 0.5 . combining these results for the two resonant modes , we measure an average lifetime @xmath88 fs .    .lifetime results and signal yields for the two @xmath35 modes analyzed .",
    "the last row is the weighted average of the two resonant channels @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the errors are statistical only . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the systematic uncertainties for the @xmath8 lifetime analysis are listed in table 2 and described below .",
    "we group them in the following categories :      lifetime shifts due to reconstruction errors have been well studied in our @xmath13 and @xmath91 work , with an order of magnitude higher statistics @xcite . because of the high redundancy and good precision of the silicon vertex detector , vertex mismeasurement effects are small at all momenta .",
    "proper time assignment depends on correct momentum determination .",
    "the selex momentum error is less than 0.5% in all cases .",
    "we assign a maximum systematic error from proper time mismeasurement of 1 fs .",
    "the effect of @xmath42 contamination under the @xmath92 peak was studied by changing the width of the exclusion window around the nominal @xmath42 mass for the k/@xmath21 interchange discussed above .",
    "effects on the @xmath49 mode are negligible . for the @xmath6 mode",
    "this gives a systematic error of 2 fs .",
    "the technique to determine the acceptance correction dependence on proper time is discussed extensively in ref .",
    "it has been verified with much larger statistics there .",
    "the maximum systematic error here is dominated by the @xmath6 correction , 3 fs . for the @xmath7 mode",
    "it is less than 2 fs .",
    "the fit was performed by the maximum likelihood method using a background parametrized by an exponential function plus a constant .",
    "we varied the width of the sidebands and the @xmath93 independently .",
    "the sytematic error due to the fit procedure is 5 fs and less than 0.5 fs for @xmath6 and @xmath7 decay modes respectively . that error is mainly dominated by the @xmath35 background parametrization .    combining in quadrature all the sources of systematic errors listed in table 2 we obtain a total systematic error of 6.2 fs ( 2.2 fs ) for the @xmath94 ( @xmath7 ) mode .",
    "we have made a new measurement of the @xmath35 lifetime in two independent resonant decay channels , @xmath94 and @xmath7 using a maximum likelihood fit .",
    "selex measures the @xmath35 lifetime to be @xmath95 fs . using the result reported in the pdg @xcite @xmath96 fs we evaluate a ratio @xmath97 , 3@xmath17 from unity . the @xmath98 lifetime reported in this letter",
    "is comparable in precision with previous experiments @xcite .",
    "our result , combined with other world data ,  @xcite , lowers the overall @xmath35 lifetime somewhat .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the lifetime ratio @xmath99 is significantly larger than unity for all the precision measurements .",
