    "in the past few years , evidence has emerged that the fine - structure constant , @xmath5 , may have been smaller in high - redshift quasar ( qso ) absorption systems than the value measured today on earth ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * hereafter ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the lower - redshift half of this result is that the abundances of the heavy mg isotopes ( @xmath6 mg and @xmath7 mg ) in the absorbers are much higher , relative to that of @xmath8 mg , than solar values .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed and expanded upon ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) a chemical evolution model with an initial mass function ( imf ) strongly enhanced at intermediate masses ( ims ) , whereby highly super - solar abundances of heavy mg isotopes are produced via asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . in this paper",
    "we explore the side - effects of this model with a view to identifying possible observational signatures other than increased heavy mg isotope abundances .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the remainder of this section summarizes the qso absorption - line evidence for and against variations in @xmath1 and describes the sensitivity of that evidence to variations in isotopic abundances .",
    "section [ nucleosynthesis ] briefly describes the nucleosynthesis of mg isotopes in stars of different masses . in section [ model ]",
    "we detail our chemical evolution models and compare them with those used by .",
    "section [ results ] presents our main results for the predicted evolution of the total and isotopic abundances of various elements typically observed in qso spectra . in each case",
    "we compare these with available data from qso absorption - line and local stellar and interstellar medium ( ism ) studies and discuss their dominant uncertainties .",
    "section [ discussion ] assesses the overall validity of the im - enhanced models in light of our new results and presents other arguments for and against such models .",
    "section [ conclusions ] gives our main conclusions .",
    "the universality and constancy of the laws of nature rely on the space - time invariance of fundamental constants , such as @xmath1 . therefore ,",
    "since @xcite and @xcite first suggested the time - variation of the newton gravitational constant , a great diversity of theoretical and experimental exploration of possible space - time variations in fundamental constants has been pursued ( e.g.  see review in * ? ? ?",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of absorption systems lying along the lines - of - sight to background qsos has provided particularly interesting constraints on variations in @xmath1 over large spatial and temporal baselines . early work focused on the alkali - doublet ( ad ) method : since the relative wavelength separation between the two transitions of an ad is proportional to @xmath10 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , comparison between ad separations seen in absorption systems with those measured in the laboratory provides a simple probe of @xmath1 variation .",
    "several authors ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) applied the ad method to doublets of several different ionic species ( e.g.  civ , siii , siiv , mgii and aliii ) .",
    "the strongest current ad constraints come from analysis of many siiv absorption systems in @xmath11 spectra : @xmath12 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* systems ; @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* systems ; @xmath15 ) , for @xmath16 and @xmath17 the values of @xmath1 in the absorption system(s ) and in the laboratory respectively . ]",
    "considerable recent interest has focused on the many - multiplet ( mm ) method introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mm method is a generalization of the ad method , constraining changes in @xmath1 by utilizing many observed transitions from different multiplets and different ions associated with each qso absorption system .",
    "it holds many important advantages over the ad method , including an effective order - of - magnitude precision gain stemming from the large differences in sensitivity of light ( e.g.  mg , si , al ) and heavy ( e.g.  fe , zn , cr ) ions to varying @xmath1 . at low redshift ( @xmath18 ) , mg lines , whose red transition wavelengths ( @xmath19 ) are relatively insensitive to changes in @xmath1 , act as anchors against which the larger expected shifts in the bluer ( @xmath20 ) fe transition wavelengths can be measured . at higher , transitions from si and al provide anchor lines distributed in wavelength space amongst a variety of cr , fe , ni and zn transitions which shift by large amounts in both positive and negative directions as @xmath1 varies .",
    "this diversity at high-  ensures greater reliability in the face of simple systematic effects compared with the low-  mg / fe systems .",
    "the mm method , applied to keck / hires qso absorption spectra , has yielded very surprising results , with the first tentative evidence for a varying @xmath1 by @xcite becoming stronger with successively larger samples ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent keck / hires constraint comes from 143 absorption systems over the range @xmath21 : @xmath22 .",
    "this result is quite internally robust : it comprises three different observational samples and approximately equal low- and high-  subsamples , all of which give consistent results .",
    "stubbornly , it has also proven resistant to a range of potential instrumental and astrophysical systematic effects @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have analysed 23 mg / fe absorption systems in higher signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectra _ from a different telescope and spectrograph _ , the vlt / uves , claiming a precise , null result over the range @xmath23 : @xmath24 . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also find null results in individual uves absorbers .",
    "the discrepancy between the vlt / uves and keck / hires results is yet to be resolved .",
    "however , it is important to note that low - order distortions of the keck / hires wavelength scale , as might be expected from simple instrumental systematic errors , produce opposite effects on the low- and high-  samples and so can not fully explain the hires ",
    "uves difference @xcite .",
    "if the hires result is incorrect , the nature of the contributory systematic errors must be subtle and somewhat conspiratorial .",
    "@xcite first identified the potential systematic error introduced into the mm method if the relative isotopic abundances of crucial anchor elements like mg and si underwent strong cosmological evolution .",
    "this is because the absorption lines of the different isotopes are spaced widely enough ( @xmath25 ) in these light ions to affect the measured line centroids ( fig .",

    "calculated  from their hires absorption line data as a function of the assumed relative isotopic abundances of mg and si .",
    "the results are presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ alpha_iso_fig ] .",
    "note the relative insensitivity of  in the high-  systems to the si heavy isotope ratio , . as noted above , this",
    "is expected because of the greater diversity of transitions and line - shifts available in the high-  regime .",
    "it is therefore important to note that evolution in the si isotopic abundance can not explain the high-  hires results .",
    "until recently , no information about the isotopic shifts in transitions from heavier ions used at high-  ( e.g.  crii , feii , niii , znii ) were available .",
    "however , due to their higher masses , the shifts are expected to be smaller with respect to the sensitivity of the lines to varying @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the recent isotopic shift calculations of @xcite confirm this .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ alpha_iso_fig ] emphasises the strong dependence of in the low-  systems on the mg heavy isotope ratio , .",
    "the importance of this potential systematic effect therefore depends entirely on the evolution of mg isotopic ratios in qso absorption systems .",
    "unfortunately , no direct measurement of  in qso absorbers is currently feasible due to the small separation of the isotopic absorption lines .",
    "fortunately however , mg is one of the few elements for which stellar isotopic abundances can be measured through molecular absorption lines , in this case transitions of mgh . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that observed stellar values of generally decrease with decreasing [ fe / h ] , as predicted in the galactic chemical evolution models of @xcite .",
    "the ( normal imf ) model we present in section [ model ] also predicts such a decrease ( fig .",
    "[ iso_grid_fig ] ) .",
    "this has been used to argue that in the low - metallicity environments of mg / fe absorbers ( typically , @xmath26}\\!\\sim\\!-1.0 $ ] ) , one should expect sub - solar values of  and so , if anything , one expects the low - values of  to be _ too positive _ @xcite .",

    "since i m agb stars are thought to produce significant quantities of @xmath6 mg and @xmath7 mg ( see section  [ nucleosynthesis ] ) , @xcite proposed that low - metallicity , i m agb stars may have polluted this globular cluster .",
    "this prompted @xcite to propose a chemical evolution model with a strongly enhanced population of i m stars as a possible explanation for the low-  hires varying-@xmath1 results .",
    "in the following sections we describe in detail the nucleosynthesis of mg isotopes and construct a chemical evolution model , similar to that of , to investigate the various effects of an im - enhanced imf .     for the elements",

    "isotopic abundances are shown on a logarithmic scale relative to the dominant isotope for that element .",
    "different curves illustrate the predicted behaviour of the various isotopes from a standard solar radius chemical evolution model .",
    "symbols show the corresponding solar values . in general , the minor isotopes accrue more slowly in the ism with respect to the dominant isotope for each element .",
    "a notable exception is ni , for which @xmath31ni/@xmath32ni declines over time .",
    "the departure of ni from the general rule of thumb may reflect uncertainties in its nucleosynthesis , including an overproduction from sne  ia , that have been pointed out in the literature ( e.g. timmes et al .",
    "1995 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "massive stars culminating in type ii sne are responsible for most of the mg isotopes in the present - day galaxy .",
    "however , there is evidence that intermediate - mass stars may dominate the production of the neutron - rich mg isotopes in the metal - poor regime . according to standard models of stellar nucleosynthesis , the yield of the heavy mg isotopes , , scales with the initial stellar metallicity .",
    "conversely , the generation of from sne  ii operates fairly independently of initial metallicity . since",
    "massive stars alone are insufficient to account for the higher than expected values of / detected in metal - poor stars ( gay & lambert 2000 ; yong et al .",
    "2003b ) , it has been suggested that there is a supplemental source of the neutron - rich mg isotopes .",
    "karakas & lattanzio ( 2003 ) have shown that and production is substantial in metal - poor intermediate - mass stars ( imss ) . at low metallicities ,",
    "asymptotic giant branch stars are believed to generate and from @xmath1-capture onto @xmath33ne triggered by he - shell thermal pulsing .",
    "temperatures at the base of the convective envelope in 46m@xmath34  stars can be high enough to burn via hot bottom burning ( hbb ) as well as synthesise large amounts of and . based on the recent nucleosynthetic calculations from karakas & lattanzio ( 2003 ) ,",
    "agb stars have been shown to produce sufficient quantities of to resolve the discrepancy between local stellar observations and previous model predictions ( fenner et al .",
    "for the present study , we have incorporated the same grids of low- and intermediate - mass stellar yields that successfully reproduced the solar neighbourhood mg isotopic evolution .",
    "the distribution of elements and isotopes as a function of time and radius was simulated for a milky way - like disk galaxy by numerically solving the classic set of equations ( as described by tinsley 1980 ) governing gas infall , star formation , stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis .",
    "in particular , we present predictions for ( i ) the solar annulus ( @xmath35 8.5 kpc ) because it is the solar neighbourhood for which we have the most comprehensive set of empirical constraints , and ( ii ) the outer disk ( @xmath35 16.5 kpc ) because it is possible that many qso absorption systems correspond to the outer regions of spiral disks ( e.g. dessauges - zavadsky et al .",

    "the star formation rate , @xmath41 , varies with the square of the gas surface density in our models , consistent with the empirical schmidt ( 1959 ) law .",
    "@xmath42 denotes the stellar yield of @xmath37 ( in mass units ) from a star of mass @xmath43 and metallicity @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the initial mass function , and @xmath46 is the mass fraction of element @xmath37 . by definition ,",
    "the sum of @xmath46 over all @xmath37 is unity .",
    "the total surface mass density is identical to the integral over the infall rate .",
    "the lower and upper stellar mass limits , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , are 0.08 m@xmath34 and 60 m@xmath34 , respectively , while @xmath49 is the main - sequence lifetime of a star of mass @xmath43 .",
    "we split the first term into three equations that deal separately with low- and intermediate - mass stars , type  ia supernova ( sn ) progenitors , and massive stars .",

    "we assumed that the milky way - like disk galaxy formed during two main gas accretion episodes .",
    "the first occurs on a rapid timescale ( @xmath50 0.5 gyr ) and is associated with the formation of the halo and thick disk , while the second episode occurs on a longer timescale and fuels the formation of stars in the disk . for simplicity ,",
    "we have assumed no prior metal - enrichment of the gas infalling onto the disk , although there is some evidence from observations of high - velocity clouds that gas falling into the galaxy may contain traces of heavy elements ( e.g. wakker et  al .",

    "the shape of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) influences the quantity of galactic material locked up in stars of different masses , which in turn determines the rate at which different elements are released into the ism .",

    "it was assumed that 4% of binary systems involving intermediate and low mass stars result in sne  ia , since this fraction provides a good fit to the solar neighbourhood ( e.g. alib ' es , labay , & canal 2001 ; fenner & gibson 2003 ) .    _ massive stars : _ for stars more massive than 810  m@xmath34 that end their lives in violent supernova explosions , we implemented the yields from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "their yields span metallicities from zero to solar and cover the mass range 1140m@xmath34 . since the upper mass limit of our stellar imf extends beyond this mass range , we extrapolated the 35 and 40 m@xmath34 yields for @xmath66 40 m@xmath34 .",
    "we took the lower energy ` a ' models for stars @xmath67m@xmath34 and the higher energy ` b ' models for heavier stars . taking note of the suggestion by timmes , woosley , & weaver ( 1995 ) that the ww95 mass - cuts may have penetrated too deeply within the iron core",

    "thus , the agb yields of species such as n and the mg isotopes are internally self - consistent . added the mg isotopic yields from karakas & lattanzio ( 2003 ) onto the marigo ( 2001 ) c , n and o yields .",
    "although this means that their n yields were not drawn from the same agb models as the mg yields , the predicted evolution of n is very similar in either case , as discussed in section  [ cn_uncertainties ] .",
    "* * type ia sne yields : * employed a metallicity - dependent type ia supernovae rate from kobayashi , tsujimoto & nomoto ( 2000 ) that prohibits the formation of sne  ia below a minimum [ fe / h ] threshold of @xmath681.1 .",
    "this metallicity - dependence was postulated mostly on theoretical grounds .",
    "observationally however , @xmath1/fe ratios in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. shetrone et al .",
    "2001 ) and s / zn ratios in dlas ( pettini , ellison , steidel & bowen 1999 ) provide evidence for sn  ia activity below [ fe / h ] @xmath69 @xmath681 .",
    "furthermore , the trend of [ o / fe ] with [ fe / h ] seen in local stars can be satisfactorily explained without imposing a sn  ia metallicity threshold ( e.g. alib ' es et al .",
    "thus , the present study does not impose a metallicity threshold and the sn  ia rate is calculated following the method of greggio & renzini ( 1983 ) and matteucci & greggio ( 1986 ) . while a [ fe / h ]  @xmath69  @xmath681 sn  ia threshold would have only a minor effect on the solar radius results , the outer disk remains metal - poor for at least several gyr and would be more sensitive to the precise sn  ia prescription , as will be discussed in section  [ results ] . * * standard imf : * in recalculating the model of timmes et al .",

    "we adopt a three - component kroupa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) law , which is flatter at lower masses and steeper at the high end of the imf .",
    "this empirically derived function leads to a lower overall effective yield that is more consistent with local data ( pagel 2001 ) .",
    "although the choice of imf does influence the evolution of the chemical species of interest in this investigation , the impact is not large enough to affect our final conclusions .",
    "model 1 from also differs from our im - enhanced model through the inclusion of an exponential 0.5 gyr time scale before the onset of the `` normal '' stellar imf component .",
    "thus , at the very earliest times , most of the star - forming gas ends up inside stars with @xmath70 5 m@xmath34 .",
    "in contrast , we retain our normal imf component at all times ( akin to s model 2 ) . *",
    "* im - enhanced imf : * while the im - bump decays exponentially on a fixed timescale ( ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 gyr depending on the model ) , we transformed this from a time to a metallicity dependence .",
    "as discussed in section  [ imf ] , the assumption that the shape of the imf is governed primarily by the chemical composition of the star forming gas cloud is presumably more physically justified than imposing a uniform time - dependence .",
    "converting from the time to the metallicity domain allows us to apply the same imf prescription to systems with various star formation histories , such as the slowly evolving outer galactic disk , which we investigate in this paper .",
    "* * dual - phase infall : * assumed that the galactic disk forms during a _ single _ phase of gas infall , in order to directly compare with the results of timmes et al .",

    "we stress that our final conclusions are largely insensitive to our choice of infall scheme .",
    "we now present the predicted chemical evolution for the solar radius and the outer galactic disk in the case of an enhanced population of intermediate - mass stars at low metallicity .",
    "these results are compared with those obtained using a normal imf and plotted against observations of local stars and dlas , where applicable . in all the following figures ,",

    "[ snia_fig ] .",
    "the incidence of type ia sne in the solar region ( solid lines ) is predicted to have risen to a peak about 7 gyr ago and steadily declined thereafter .",
    "in contrast , the predicted sn  ia rate in the outer disk ( dashed lines ) has continued to increase up to the present - day .",
    "this difference reflects the more rapid and efficient conversion of gas into stars in regions of higher surface density .",
    "a consequence of an imf that increases the number of intermediate - mass stars is the birth of more type ia sne progenitors .",
    "type ia sne are understood to be associated with binary systems of low- and intermediate - mass stars , in which the mass lost by the more evolved star is accreted by its white dwarf ( wd ) companion until the wd can no longer be sustained by electron degenerate pressure and a violent explosion ensues . comparing the thick and thin solid lines in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ snia_fig ] , it can be seen that the im - enhanced imf has no significant affect on the local solar neighbourhood sn  ia rate . in the outer disk ,",
    "however , the agb - enhancement elevates the sn  ia rate by up to a factor of six between 0.51 gyr and about a factor two at 3 gyr before converging with the normal imf model after @xmath696 gyr ( compare the thick and thin dashed lines ) .",
    "the different impact of the im - enhanced imf on the solar and outer radii is due to a faster build - up of metals in the solar radius relative to the outer disk .",
    "this causes the im - bump to decay more quickly and leads to only a minor increase in the sn  ia rate .",
    "in contrast , the slower rate of enrichment in the outer radius leads to a longer - lasting im - bump , which has a significant impact on the sn  ia rate at early times .",
    "im - enhanced imfs at low metallicity could leave an observable trace on the cosmic sn  ia rate , which could be used to discriminate between these models ( fields et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "type ia sne are major producers of iron and are responsible for 1/32/3 of the solar fe content ( e.g. timmes et al .",
    "thus , any increased incidence of sn  ia leads inevitably to the production of more fe , as seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ snia_fig ] where the evolution of [ fe / h ] is plotted .",
    "the inclusion of an enhanced i m agb population increases the abundance of iron in the ism of the outer disk by a factor of 23 between 13 gyr . once again , the solar radius is less sensitive to the im - enhanced imf because the amplitude of the im - bump decays on a shorter timescale .    as well as being sn  ia progenitors , agbs leave behind white dwarf remnants that can be indirectly detected through microlensing experiments .",
    "we found that the im - enhanced imf increases the present - day number of wd remnants by only about 5% and 10% for the solar and outer radii , respectively .",
    "thus , the number of wds is not expected to be a sensitive discriminant of the different imf scenarios .",
    "this echos the galactic halo results of gibson & mould ( 1997 ) and fields , freese , & graff ( 2000 ) , who found that stellar c and n abundances provide far stronger constraints than wd counts on any enhancement in the number of lims at early times .",
    "it should be noted that although only predict the evolution at the solar radius , if their im - enhanced model were applied to the outer disk we expect that they would _ not _ predict an increase in either the sn  ia rate or [ fe / h ] because their sn  ia prescription prohibits the formation of type ia sne in metal - poor environments .",

    "an early imf heavily biased towards intermediate - mass stars is a potential explanation of the @xmath1-variation apparent in keck / hires qso spectra . during their agb phase",

    "however , such a strong contribution from agbs should be evident in the detailed abundance patterns obtained in a growing number of dlas . using chemical evolution models of a milky way - like spiral galaxy at different radii , we have tested the idea that agb stars were more prevalent in the metal - poor universe .",
    "the predicted chemical ramifications of an enhanced agb population are not supported by the available data , with the strongest argument against severe agb pollution coming from the low [ n/@xmath1 ] values observed in dlas .",
    "contrary to the conclusions of , we do not find consistent model parameters which simultaneously explain the keck / hires varying-@xmath1 and abundance data .",

    ". future measurements of ( or limits on ) the @xmath3c/@xmath4c ratio from line - profile asymmetries and further dla observations of other elements synthesised by agb stars , such as al and p , may provide additional constraints on the imf s shape at early epochs .    the sensitivity of low-@xmath81 mg / fe  measurements to isotopic abundance variations in mg ( fig .

    "* ) then future samples of mg / fe absorbers might reveal mg isotopic abundance variations in two ways : ( i ) through the bulk relative line shifts between mg and fe transitions studied previously and , ( ii ) if we assume that agb pollution of the absorbers is not uniform , through an increased scatter in the line shifts .",
