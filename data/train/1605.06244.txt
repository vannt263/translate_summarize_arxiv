    "this is a very surprising result because probably we first obtained this result for any spherically symmetric , stationary and non - asymptotic flat spacetime . in appendix -",
    "a , we derived the cm energy for extreme tn bh and we found that the diverging value of cm energy .",
    "in this section , we should study what is the role of nut parameter in the baados , silk and west ( bsw ) effect which was predicted by baados , silk and west @xcite several years ago .",
    "does tn bh could be act as a particle accelerator with arbitrarily high energy when the bh is extremal .",
    "this is the main aim in this section and motivated by the previous section from the analysis of geodesic structure .",
    "we have considered the particle acceleration and collision in the cm frame . to determine the cm energy , we consider first two particles coming from infinity with @xmath114 approaching the tn bh with different angular momenta @xmath115 and @xmath116 and colliding at some radius @xmath34 .",
    "later , we choose the collision point is at @xmath34 to approach the horizon @xmath117 .",
    "also we have assumed that the particles are initially to be at rest at infinity .",
    "the formula that we have used here suggested first by bsw @xcite should read @xmath118 since in the previous section we have calculated total geodesic structure confined in the equatorial plane for tn bh , so we should not repeat it again .",
    "due to the time - like isometry and space - like isometry the space - time possesses two conserved quantities one is the energy and other is the angular momentum .",
    "thus for massive particles , the components of the four velocity are @xmath119 and      putting these values in ( [ cme ] ) , we find the expression for cm energy : @xmath121 where , @xmath122 for simplicity , @xmath123 and reverting back the value of @xmath124 , we obtain the cm energy near the event horizon ( @xmath22 ) of tn space - time : @xmath125 and for cauchy horizon ( @xmath23 ) the cm energy is @xmath126 where @xmath127 is defined previously .",
    "it implies that the cm energy is finite and depends upon the values of angular momentum parameter .",
    "it also suggests that the cm energy depends upon the nut parameter .",
    "it may also playing a key role in the bsw effect as we have seen from the above expression .",
    "now see what happens in case of mass - less case and _ extreme _ case ?",
    "first we consider the mass - less case , in this case the cm energy is given by @xmath129 it indicates that the cm energy is finite depends on the nut parameter .",
    "more interesting case i.e. the extreme case where the cm energy is given by @xmath130 since we know for extreme case , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "therefore we find for extreme tn bh : @xmath133 i.e the cm energy is _",
