    "the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation ignores the correlation between electrons , but gives roughly 99% of the total electronic energy @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is often accurate for the prediction of molecular structure @xcite , computationally cheap and can be applied to large systems , especially within local ( linear - scaling ) strategies @xcite . to reduce the computational cost still further ,",
    "various numerical techniques have been developed including , for example , density fitting ( or resolution of the identity ) @xcite , pseudospectral and cholesky decomposition @xcite , dual basis methods @xcite , and both attenuation @xcite and resolution @xcite of the coulomb operator .",
    "unfortunately , the part of the energy which the hf approximation ignores can have important chemical effects and this is particularly true when bonds are formed and/or broken . consequently",
    ", realistic model chemistries require a satisfactory treatment of electronic correlation .",

    "`` for thousands of years mathematicians have enjoyed competing with one other to compute ever more digits of the number @xmath7 . among modern physicists ,",
    "a close analogy is computation of the ground state energy of the helium atom , begun 75 years ago by e. a. hylleraas . '' _",
    "although @xmath0 in the helium atom is now known very accurately , certain correlation effects remain incompletely understood and , for example , even the coulomb hole @xcite itself is more subtle than one might imagine .",
    "the primary effect of correlation is to decrease the likelihood of finding the two electrons close together and increase the probability of their being far apart .",
    "however , accurate calculations have revealed the existence of a secondary coulomb hole , implying that correlation also brings distant electrons closer together @xcite .",
    "the same observation has been made in the h@xmath8 molecule by per _",
    "_ @xcite and it appears that secondary ( or long - range ) coulomb holes may be ubiquitous in two - electron systems @xcite .    in order to get benchmark results for the development of intracule functional theory ( ift ) @xcite , we have recently initiated an exhaustive study of two - electron systems @xcite . in the present frontier article , we review our recent progress in the determination of the correlation energy in various high - density two - electron systems : the helium - like ions ( sec .",

    "it is reasonable to ask whether an understanding of the high - density regime is relevant to normal chemical systems but it turns out that most of the high - density behaviour of electrons is surprisingly similar to that at typical atomic and molecular electron densities .",
    "much can be learned about the languid waltz of a pair of electrons in a covalent bond from their frenetic jig in the high - density limit .",
    "moreover , it has led to an understanding of key systems , such as the uniform electron gas @xcite , which form the cornerstone of the popular local density approximation in solid - state physics @xcite .",
    "we also show ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ldl ] ) that , in the large - dimension limit , the high - density correlation energy of two electrons is given by a simple universal rule which is independent of the external confining potential . just as one learns about interacting systems by studying non - interacting ones and then introducing the interaction perturbatively , one can understand our three - dimensional world by studying high - dimensional analogues and introducing dimension - reduction perturbatively .",
    "in this study , we confine our attention to the @xmath9 ground states of two - electron systems .",
