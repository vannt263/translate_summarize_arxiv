    "index coding with side - information ( icsi )  @xcite , is a problem , where a server has @xmath1 stored messages that it can broadcast over a noiseless channel to a set of receivers or clients .",

    "the objective of the icsi problem is to devise an optimal coding strategy that minimizes the number of broadcast transmissions made by the server to satisfy the requirements of all the clients .",
    "the optimality criterion of an index code is its code length . the optimal index code length , i.e.",
