    "flows with inhomogeneous velocity profiles are one of the prevalent and still not completely understood macro - systems .",
    "they occur in laboratory experiments , industrial applications , the earth s atmosphere , oceans and many astrophysical objects .",
    "we concentrate attention on smooth shear flows ( flows without inflection point in the velocity profile ) that are linearly stable according to the canonical hydrodynamics",
    ". faults in the comprehension of shear flow dynamics is caused by the incompleteness of the classical method of normal modes .",
    "specifically , method of modes leaves out of account the non - normality of the linear operators that often produces powerful transient development of a subset of perturbations @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the case of the non - normality of linear operators , corresponding eigenfunctions are not orthogonal and strongly interfere @xcite .",
    "hence , a correct approach should fully analyze the eigenfunction interference , which is feasible in asymptotic : in fact , in modal analysis only the asymptotic stability of flow is studied , while _ no attention _ is paid to any particular initial value or finite time period of the dynamics  this period of the evolution is thought to have no significance and is left to speculation .",
    "recognition of the importance of the non - normality in the linear stability resulted impressive progress in the understanding of the shear flow phenomena in 90s of the last century .",
    "the early transient period for the perturbations has been shown to reveal rich and complicated behavior leading to various consequences .",
    "it has been grasped phenomena that are overlooked in the framework of the modal analysis .",
    "the progress in the understanding of the shear flow phenomena has been achieved using so - called non - modal approach ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which implicates a change of independent variables from a laboratory to a moving frame and the study of temporal evolution of _ spatial fourier harmonics _ ( sfhs ) of perturbations without any spectral expansion in time . strictly speaking the non - modal approach",
    "is applicable to the flows with constant velocity shear .",
    "however , it is obvious that the results obtained in the framework of the approach are valid for any shear flows without inflection point , if the wavelength of modes is appreciably shorter than the characteristic length scale of the inhomogeneity .",
    "the progress involves novel results on the time evolution of vortex and wave perturbations ; elaboration of a concept of self - sustaining turbulence in the spectrally stable shear flows ( that was labelled as bypass concept ) @xcite . among the novelties one should stress ( in the context of the present paper ) disclosure of the linear mechanisms of resonance transformation of waves at low shear rates @xcite and non - resonant conversion of vortices to waves at moderate and high shear rates @xcite .",
    "the later phenomena should be inherent to flow systems .",
    "this was shown in papers @xcite , where appearances of some waves in solar wind and galactic disks are explained by the linear wave transformations in the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows .",
    "aim of the present work is quantitative and qualitative study of the linear evolution of three dimensional mhd waves at low and high shear rates .",
    "equilibrium density , pressure and magnetic field are assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "specifically , we perform analytical and numerical study of the important effect caused by linear forces  mutual transformations of mhd waves . the waves are coupled ( during a limited time interval ) at the specific system parameters and mutual transformations of two , or even all three of them occur .",
    "analytical expressions of transformation coefficients are obtained for wide range of the system parameters .",
    "we study the wave over - reflection phenomena at high shear rates : mhd waves extract flow energy , are amplified non - exponentially and are over - reflected .",
    "mathematical methods used in this paper are similar to ones that were first developed for quantum mechanical problems : non - elastic atomic collisions @xcite and non - adiabatic transitions in two level quantum systems @xcite . later , the same asymptotic methods were successfully applied to various problems ( see , e.g. , ref .",
