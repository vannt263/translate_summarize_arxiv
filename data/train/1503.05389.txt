    ", we will refer to the latter as the hybl inequality .",
    "the application of these tools leads to very transparent and elegant proofs .",

    "then we can write down the expectation in the following form : @xmath98        here and in similar formulas below , we use the following notation : for a  set of natural numbers @xmath104 , we denote by @xmath105 the number of elements in @xmath104 and by @xmath106 the subset of @xmath104 that contains all elements of @xmath104 except the last one .",

    "now we note that the products @xmath113 in the case where @xmath114 give rise to a class of @xmath112-type kernels ( or fejr - type kernels ) .",
    "namely , if assumption  [ assumph ] holds and @xmath115 , then @xmath116 is a kernel over @xmath117 , which is an approximate identity for convolution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and @xmath118 provided that the function @xmath119 is bounded and continuous at the point @xmath120 .",
    "let us first consider the partitions @xmath104 composed by pairs . for those partitions ,",
    "when the products of only the cumulants of the form @xmath121 appear in  ( [ eitk ] ) , we obtain under the integral sign in ( [ ejkt ] ) the terms of the form @xmath122 we note that there are @xmath123 such terms , therefore , in the expression for @xmath124 , we have the term @xmath125 and this is the only case where we have @xmath3 kernels , and all @xmath3 factors @xmath126 are used to compose these kernels @xmath127 .    in all other partitions , we will be able to compose from 1 to @xmath128 kernels taking combination of @xmath129 with suitable arguments : for each 2nd - order kernel , we will use one of the factors @xmath130 from @xmath131 ; otherwise , when composing the @xmath132th order kernel with @xmath133 , we will need the normalizing factor @xmath134 , and therefore we will modify the factor @xmath131 by taking , instead , @xmath135 .",
    "so , for those partitions , when we compose kernels of orders , say , @xmath136 , with @xmath137 , the corresponding integral in ( [ ejkt ] ) will be represented in the form of a generalized convolution of some product of spectral densities of different orders with the product of kernels of orders @xmath136 , and the factor @xmath138 will be supplied to the integral .",
    "for example , in the simplest case where @xmath139 , the corresponding term in ( [ ejkt ] ) can be represented as follows : @xmath140    now we take into account the following asymptotics for @xmath141 : @xmath142 , where @xmath143 , and conclude that , in the case of @xmath53 kernels , @xmath144 , the factor ( [ factor ] ) is asymptotically of order @xmath145 ; the corresponding integrals containing these kernels will converge to finite limits under the conditions of the theorem according to ( [ convol ] ) .",

    "for asymptotic analysis of expression  ( [ covar ] ) , we can use the reasonings analogous to those for the case of functionals of squared periodogram in @xcite , but now , dealing with the tapered case , we need to keep track of normalizing factors for appearing kernels . again , similarly to the previous consideration of the expectation , we analyze all possible partitions and kernels that can be composed for every particular partition .",
