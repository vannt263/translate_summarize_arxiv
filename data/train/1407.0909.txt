    "numerous efforts have been made to expand such knowledge but have led to contradicting results : statistical studies on the reddening of quasars suggest a steeply rising extinction curve like ( or even steeper than ) that of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , which indicates the predominance of small grains @xcite , while a flat or `` gray '' extinction curve ( which varies little with wavelength ) has also been proposed , which suggests the richness of large grains @xcite .",

    ", a clumpy geometry can not produce silicate depths greater than @xmath86 ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "grains of @xmath8 are an effective scatter and absorber . for larger grains ( say , @xmath90 ) , they are less effective in extinguishing the optical light but become effective in producing the 9.7@xmath5 silicate absorption feature ( see z. shao et al.2014 , in preparation )",

    "there is evidence that suggests that the dust in the agn torus is larger than the dust in the ism .",

    "* , who argued that the x - ray absorption and optical extinction may occur in distinct media ) .",
    "we note that the preferential destruction of small dust by x - ray photons in the agn torus could also lead to the predominance of large dust and result in reduced @xmath97 and @xmath98 ratios .",

    "in agn torus , if carbon dust is preferentially destroyed , one would also expect a low @xmath4 ratio since carbon dust only contributes to @xmath0 while silicate dust contributes to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "@xcite explained this as that the optical extinction and the silicate absorption may take place at different regions : the silicate absorption mainly arises from the dust which is concentrated toward the center of the galaxy , while the nlr emission comes from larger scales and is additionally absorbed by ambient dust in the host galaxy .",

    "they accurately measured the silicate absorption in archival low - resolution _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectroscopy .",
    "they found that @xmath1545% of the sources have strong silicate absorption with @xmath104 .",
    "differing from @xcite , @xcite argued that the dominant contribution to the observed silicate absorption is made by the dust located in the host galaxy and not necessarily in a compact obscuring torus surrounding the central engine .",
    "we note that the discussions on the low @xmath4 ratio presented in this work are based on the assumption that both the optical extinction and the silicate absorption are from the torus .",
    "the optical extinction derived from the nlr balmer decrement may not be fully representative of the torus extinction since the nlr may not be obscured by the entire torus .",
    "the extinction can also come from the dust in hosts .",
    "however , if the hosts also contribute to the mid - ir extinction , a low value of @xmath4 ratio in agns compared to the galactic ism can still be expected , since @xmath105/\\left[{\\delta\\tau_{9.7}}\\left({\\rm host}\\right)+{\\delta\\tau_{9.7}}\\left({\\rm torus}\\right)\\right ] > a_v\\left({\\rm",
    "torus}\\right)/{\\delta\\tau_{9.7}}\\left({\\rm torus}\\right)$ ] .",
    "we call on further studies on the origin of the optical and silicate extinction .",
    "nevertheless , if the optical extinction and the silicate absorption are indeed from very different regions , one should not expect any correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "mismatches in the extinction regions traced by optical and silicate absorption may act as the secondary effect , at most , in the correlation shown in figure  [ fig : mir_ext5 ] .",

    "we attribute this anomalously low @xmath4 ratio of agns to a dust size distribution skewed toward substantially large grains , as a result of preferential destruction of small grains by x - ray / uv photons and/or grain growth in the dense circumnuclear regions of agns .",
