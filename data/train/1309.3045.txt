    "fits the data of the spectrum of perturbations . on the other hand , as the background independent quantisation of general relativity ( gr ) , loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite has been rather active in recent two decades .",
    "the expectation that the singularity predicted by classical gr would be resolved by quantum gravity has been confirmed by the recent study of the loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite , which is a simplified , symmetric model of lqg @xcite .",
    "the big - bang singularity in the cosmological model of gr is replaced by the quantum bounce of lqc .",
    "recently , the nonperturbative quantisation scheme of lqg has been successfully extended to @xmath2 theories @xcite and brans - dicke theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the corresponding cosmological model for brans - dicke theory has been set up @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compare the jordan frame with einstein frame of brans - dicke gravity by their loop quantum cosmology models .",
    "note that the original formulation of brans - dicke theory was in jordan frame . if one and the same metric is employed to represent physical space - time ,",
    "the jordan and einstein frames are equivalent to each other in classical brans - dicke theory . however , there is no guarantee for the equivalence of the quantisation in two frames .",
    "as shown in @xcite the quantisation procedure of brans - dicke theory shall distinguish between two cases : @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper we shall assume that @xmath4 .",
    "this assumption comes from observational limitations on brans - dicke theory , which prefers @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "+ to transform the brans - dicke theory into einstein frame one has to redefine the metric tensor , which would cause the canonical form of the gr action .",

    "we take the original idea of brans and dicke that jordan frame is the physical one , though in general this remains open .",
    "for instance the quantisation in different frames may give different results of the evolution of primordial gravitational waves , which in the future could help us to discriminate one frame and favour the other .",

    "in this paper we have considered the issue of the semi - classical evolution of the universe in both jordan and einstein frames of lqc brans - dicke theory with scalar potential @xmath10 coupled with an additional scalar field @xmath9 with a potential @xmath11 .",
    "the hamiltonian formalism of the corresponding cosmological models are presented in terms of geometrical variables as well as connection variables respectively .",
    "+ to compare the jordan frame with einstein frame of brans - dicke theory , the same cosmological model is quantized by lqc method in both frames separately .",
    "we then consider the effective equations with lqc holonomy corrections resulted from the different frames quantisation .",
    "in particular , the effective friedmann equations and equations of motion for the scalar fields are obtained in both frames . in the jordan frame quantisation",
    "it is shown that not only the potential term of the brans - dicke field @xmath8 , but also @xmath11 can lead to corrections to the effective equation of motion of @xmath8 . in the @xmath149 limit the classical brans - dicke theory can be recovered from the effective theory . in the @xmath221 case equations of motion for scalar fields and the semi - classical friedmann equation",
    "are of the the same form as for the brans - dicke theory with and without a potential .",
    "+ analytical solutions have been found for the effective equations resulted from both frames quantisation without potential in the vacuum case and in the additional massless scalar field case separately . in the vacuum case ,",
    "the brans - dicke scalar field can be employed as an internal time . in the matter coupled case , the matter scalar field @xmath9 is used as a time variable , and the analytical relation ( valid in the effective theory of both frames and in the classical theory ) between the two scalar fields is obtained . in all those solutions",
    "the bouncing evolution of the scale factor has been obtained around planck regime .",
    "however , the quantisation of different frames lead to different scales of the bounces of the scale factor @xmath222 .",
    "the jordan frame quantisation and the einstein frame quantisation require @xmath223 and @xmath224 respectively for the occurrence of the bounce . hence , different frame quantisation gives different physics .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : voffields ] , the evolutional trajectories of the jordan frame volume of the elementary cell of the universe are different for different frames quantisation .",
    "+ however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : einvsjord ] in the vacuum case the difference of the evolutional trajectories of the jordan frame hubble parameter disappears for time @xmath220 after the bounces .",
    "therefore , it may be difficult to distinguish between frames quantisation by observations of primordial inhomogeneities .",
    "the situation may change by the fine - tuning of the initial conditions of the einstein frame quantisation , which ( comparing to the jordan frame quantisation ) may sufficiently decrease the scale of the jordan frame bounce .",
    "in particular this could lead to the jordan frame bounce around the gut scale with the period of superinflation visible in the power spectrum of primordial inhomogeneities .",
    "this issue , analyzed in the context of starobinsky inflation , shall be the goal of our future work .",
    "+ another interesting feature of the bounce in loop quantum brans - dicke cosmology , explored in fig .",
    "[ fig : voffields ] , is that , unlike the case of lqc of gr , the evolutional trajectories of the two sides of the bounce point are obviously asymmetric . as a by - product , we also find an analytical solution with jordan frame potential @xmath206 in the theory of einstein frame quantisation .",
