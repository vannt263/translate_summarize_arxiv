    "these considerations agree remarkably with the kinetic temperature of @xmath80 selected for the @xmath81 polymer simulations , @xmath82 .",
    "however , as the size of the hydrophobic block grows , the transition state should also have an additional contribution due to the free energy cost of passing a globule through the brush formed by the hydrophilic coronas .",

    "an example from one simulation run is shown in , plots for all other simulation runs performed are qualitatively very similar , though the ordered phase appears at different times .    after starting the simulation shown in from a random configuration , micelles quickly form in only a few thousand time steps and single micelle degrees of freedom",

    "subsequent analysis however , showed that cubic lattices other than bcc can not be ruled out near the disorder transition  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the characteristic property of bcc lattices is that their free energy is closer to the disordered state , thus suggesting that bcc lattices follow an ostwald step rule @xcite , where the solid phase that nucleates first is the one whose free energy is closest to the disordered ( or fluid ) state . in this case , the complete crystallization process would require an additional step , where after the bcc crystallites are formed , they gradually evolve towards the stable thermodynamic phase .",
    "certainly , it follows from our results that fcc lattices are difficult to obtain by md for the systems we simulate , but at least in one system ( @xmath110 at @xmath122 ) the fcc lattice has been obtained reproducibly , and did not proceed through an intermediate bcc step .",
    "in addition , for this very same system , closer to the disordered state ( @xmath123 ) , no fcc structure was found to be stable .",
    "although not completely conclusive , our results are more consistent with the bcc as being a stable thermodynamic phase near the disordered phase .",
    "there are serious limitations in identifying micelles as simple particles , because as the disordered phase is approached micelle aggregation numbers decrease and polymers become essentially free .",
    "so the disordered phase is not a simple liquid as it is assumed by am and all subsequent work .",
    "similar analysis in polymer melts @xcite , shows that in the vicinity of the spinodal , the only possible phase with cubic symmetry is bcc . beyond the spinodal ,",
    "other structures are favored @xcite .",
    "based on the previous discussion , we attribute the stability of the bcc phases observed in our simulations as a reflection of the admittedly non - rigorous statement that bcc phases are _ usually favored _ near the disordered transition .",
    "we defer to future work to establish this result within a rigorous framework , where all the nuances involved in micelle formation are properly taken into account .",
    "the @xmath60 and @xmath81 polymers discussed in this paper provide coarse - grained descriptions of pluronic f127 .",
    "all simulations have been carried out in very good solvent conditions for the @xmath1 beads and at total volume fractions of 1520% .",
    "experimental results in this region of the phase diagram are surprisingly disparate .",
    "simple cubic  @xcite , bcc  @xcite and fcc  @xcite have all been proposed as the structure in this region .",
    "very recently , on the basis of new experimental data , the situation has been thoroughly reviewed by li et al .",
    "@xcite ( although for significantly higher temperatures ) , see also ref .",
    "@xcite , but without clear conclusive results .",
    "our theoretical analysis clearly favors the bcc lattice close to the disorder transition .",
    "the comparison of our results with the experimental f127 system is more accurate at low temperatures ( at 20 - 25 c ) , where the water can be considered as a good solvent for peo , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have shown that md allows a detailed investigation of both the dynamics as well as the thermodynamic equilibrium of micellar crystals .",
    "many studies have been performed by modeling micelles as point particles , where the complex structure of the micelles is accommodated through refined two - body potentials , either derived analytically or empirically . while successful in many situations , two - body potentials do not account for the dynamic nature of micelles , which play a critical role in determining the phases of the system , particularly near the disorder transition .",
    "there are a few areas where further work needs to be performed .",
    "first , all simulations in this work have been performed in good solvent conditions .",
    "md with implicit solvents of different quality are also of great interest , especially to determine the phases of pluronic systems over a wide range of temperatures  @xcite .",
    "next , the largest micellar crystal formed in this work contains 2134 polymers ( 57,618 beads ) .",
    "we were unable to find any order in larger systems , even after running as many as 50 million time steps .",
    "it is possible that significantly longer simulations may be required for larger systems .",
    "also , the range of applicability of md is restricted to a relatively narrow range near the disorder transition , as schematically shown in .",
    "finally , the role of the solvent will need to be investigated in more detail , as it is found in the rouse vs.  zimm dynamics for simple homopolymers  @xcite .",
    "future studies will be necessary to completely clarify and expand all these issues .",
    "the relevance of our study goes beyond pure systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite for example , pluronic polymers have been used to template the growth of an inorganic phase of calcium phosphate , aimed at creating new polymer nanocomposites with lightweight / high strength properties or that mimic the structure of real bone .",
    "an understanding of the pure systems is clearly a prerequisite for accurate models of polymer nanocomposites .",
    "we hope to report more on this topic in the near future .",
    "we acknowledge interest and discussions with s. mallapragada , k. schmidt - rohr and g. grason .",
    "we also thank j. schmalian for clarifications regarding the alexander - mctague paper .",
