    "@xcite , the atoms experienced a periodic potential in only one direction , being free to move on a much larger length scale in the other directions .",
    "this implied that interactions between atoms could be ignored . if the atoms are confined to reside on the sites of a lattice in three dimensions , interactions become important . as a result , it was shown theoretically  @xcite , and subsequently also experimentally  @xcite , that a system of interacting cold atoms , residing in the lowest bloch band of the periodic potential , maps onto a bosonic hubbard model .",
    "this model is of great theoretical interest since it exhibits a quantum phase transition  @xcite between ground states where the atoms are localized ( mott - insulator ) and where they are delocalized ( superfluid ) as the strength of the hopping relative to the inter - atomic interaction is varied .",
    "the dynamics of particles under the influence of changes in the hamiltonian ( such as lattice tilts or rapid changes in the particle interaction strength ) has also proved interesting @xcite .",
    "another development is an interest in the idea of mixing bosonic atoms of different flavors in the lattice  @xcite .",
    "several ways of achieving multiple flavors have been suggested including using atoms of different species and exploiting different internal atomic states .",
    "so far , experiments on strongly interacting atoms in three dimensional optical lattices have been restricted to atoms in the lowest ( zeroth ) bloch band .",
    "recently scarola and dassarma considered the possibility of novel supersolid phases within the first excited bloch band of an optical lattice .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , the theory of atoms in the two lowest ( zeroth and first ) bloch bands of a three dimensional optical lattice is considered .",
    "we show here , that due to the lack of available phase space for the decay products , such excited states can ( in some parameter ranges ) have life times much longer than the characteristic time scales for inter - site hopping . thus it should be possible to establish quasi - equilibrium within the manifold of these metastable states .",
    "we find that it is possible in this way to realize novel effective multi - species bosonic hubbard hamiltonians .",
    "depending on the choice of lattice depths the number of degenerate bands varies and we find effective models involving @xmath0 flavors of bosons , where @xmath0 can be 1 , 2 , or 3 .",
    "these flavors correspond to the three different possible nodal planes in the excited state wave function such as the one illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : wavefuns ] ) . we will show that a characteristic of these hamiltonians is that ( to a good approximation ) each flavor can only hop in one direction ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath1 ( nodal plane ) particles can only hop in the @xmath2 direction , etc . ) . neglecting interactions",
    "we would then have @xmath0 interpenetrating one - dimensional free bose gases , one for each column ( or row ) in the lattice . allowing intra - species interactions converts these one - dimensional gases into luttinger liquids ( or , if the interactions are strong enough , and the mean particle number per site is an integer , into mott insulators ) .",
    "we show below that , besides intra - species interactions , the full interaction also includes on - site inter - species conversion terms that allow atoms to change flavor in pairs .",
    "thus for example , two @xmath1 particles constrained to move along a single @xmath2 column can collide , turn into @xmath3 particles and move away along a @xmath4 column .",
    "such processes lead to novel quantum dynamics for this coupled set of interpenetrating luttinger liquids .",
    "( plotted in the plane @xmath5 ) formed by the zeroth band bloch functions and the wave function @xmath6 formed by the zeroth band bloch functions in the y- and z- directions and the bloch functions from the first band in the x - direction .",
    "these are approximately harmonic oscillator states , @xmath7 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] where the parameter @xmath9 is determined by the curvature of the optical lattice potential near its minima . similarly @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "[ fig : wavefuns],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    as will be seen , the anisotropic nature of the hopping in conjunction with the pairwise conversion leads to hamiltonians with an infinite but subextensive set of @xmath12-gauge symmetries intermediate between local and global .",
    "such infinite symmetries have been found in certain frustrated spin models  @xcite and in a ` bose metal ' model  @xcite and are known to cause dimensional reduction in some cases .",
    "@xcite we will see below how this dimensional reduction appears in a simple way in this system .",
    "a related _ global _ @xmath12 symmetry and associated ising order parameter appear in problems involving boson pairing due to attractive interactions mediated by feshbach resonances . in that case",
    "the symmetry appears due to a conversion term that connects pairs of bosons with a distinct molecular field .",
    "this can lead to exotic states in which pairs of bosons are condensed but single bosons are _ not _ and in which half vortices are permitted @xcite    further , due to strong interatomic repulsion , the ground state in 3d ( three flavors ) breaks a kind of chiral symmetry and displays an additional accidental ground state degeneracy at the mean field level .",
    "a similar situation occurs for special parameter values in frustrated xy - models , where parallel zero energy domain walls can be inserted  @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : lattice_ham ] the appropriate generalization of the bosonic hubbard model is introduced along with numerical values of the parameters entering the hamiltonians obtained from band - structure calculations for various lattice depths .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : effective_hams ] , the aforementioned effective hamiltonians for atoms in the first band are derived for three particular choices of relative lattice depths in the @xmath13 directions . using simple mean - field theory we sketch the ground state phase - diagrams in section  [ sec : mft ] and in section  [ sec : interference ] we discuss how the superfluid phases are reflected in the interference pattern in an experimental situation . finally , in section  [",
    "sec : lifetime ] , treating the interaction perturbatively to second order , we estimate the lifetime of a population inverted state ( all atoms residing entirely in the first excited band ) .",
    "the starting point is the hamiltonian for weakly interacting bosons of mass @xmath14 in an external potential  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-wave scattering length .",
    "the external potential has two contributions @xmath18 and @xmath19 corresponding to the lattice potential and the magnetic trapping potential . denoting the wavelength of the lasers by @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the lattice spacing ,",

    "in this section we will focus on the meta - stable situation having all atoms in the first bloch band(s ) of the lattice .",
    "it is quite easy to achieve such a situation , i.e. consider an initial moment of time when the optical lattice has been loaded with atoms in the lowest bloch band , @xmath64 .",
    "the anharmonicity of the lattice well potential allows one to treat the vibrational degree of freedom as a two level system .",
    "if one singles out , say , the @xmath2-direction , then , by applying an appropriate vibrational @xmath65-pulse , i.e.   shaking \" the lattice in this direction with a frequency on resonance with the transition @xmath66 , the state can be inverted and the atoms excited to states with band index @xmath67 .",
    "a strong @xmath65-pulse can achieve this inversion in a time short compared to the inter - well hopping time so that the dispersion of the upper band is not an issue in the inversion process .",
    "the simplest starting state would be the mott insulator state with one boson per site in the lowest band . in a typical experimental setup ,",
    "the parabolic confining potential will cause the population of each well to vary and the system will be in a state with regions of mott insulators with different filling factors .",
    "it is however easy to confirm ( by direct simulation ) that even in this case , taking interactions into account , a pulse shape can be tailored that will invert the population simultaneously for regions with different filling factors provided a deep enough lattice is used .",
    "another way of preparing the initial state is to use the method recently demonstrated by browaeys _",
    "_ @xcite . by loading a condensate into a moving 1d lattice and applying a subsequent acceleration",
    "the condensate can be prepared in the lowest energy state ( quasimomentum @xmath68 ) in the first bloch band .",
    "the situation desired in this paper can then be obtained by ramping up the lattice in the two remaining ( perpendicular ) directions adiabatically .",
    "the natural question regarding the lifetime of the resulting meta - stable state will be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : lifetime ] .",
    "the subsequent dynamics of atoms in the first band(s ) is then predominantly governed by some subset of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : latticehamiltonian ] ) . this relevant subset will be referred to as the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we will treat three different regimes of values for the lattice potentials @xmath45 which lead to effective hamiltonians with one , two , and three flavors respectively .",
    "the three scenarios are :    1 .",
    "@xmath69 ( 1d , single flavor ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath70 ( 2d , two flavors ) .",
    "3 .   @xmath71 ( 3d , three flavors ) .",
    "as indicated , the number of particle flavors as well as the dimensionalities in the effective hamiltonians vary .    the reason for the different numbers of flavors becomes clear if one considers the restrictions on the final states into which two atoms may scatter due to the interatomic interaction ; the presence or absence of such states can be inferred from the presence or absence of degenerate , or nearly degenerate , levels in the energy spectrum of the noninteracting system .",
    "take , for example the second scenario above with @xmath72 and all atoms initially in a state with index @xmath67 , then , due to the on - site inter - atomic interaction these atoms can scatter elastically into a state with index @xmath73 through a first order process the connecting different degenerate states .",
    "further , it is easy to show that scattering resulting in states with other indices , for instance @xmath74 , is only possible through higher order processes if energy ( and also parity ) is to be conserved and can safely be ignored if the gas is dilute .",
    "hence , the atoms can , at a formal level , be divided into two flavors : an @xmath1 flavor corresponding to atoms in @xmath67 and a @xmath3 flavor in @xmath73 . by the same argument",
    "one can see how the one- and three - flavor situations arise .",
    "apart from having different number of flavors the dimensionalities of the effective hamiltonians differ . to understand this consider again the second case above , @xmath70 , with particles in the excited bands @xmath67 and @xmath73 corresponding to @xmath1- and @xmath3-flavors",
    ". for the @xmath1 flavor , hopping in the @xmath2-direction has a matrix element @xmath75 while hopping in the @xmath4- and @xmath76- direction have matrix elements @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively . looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : j12 ] it is then clear that , to a good approximation , the @xmath1 particles can only hop in the @xmath2-direction while hopping in the @xmath4- and @xmath76-directions is strongly ( exponentially ) suppressed .",
    "similarly the @xmath3 particles can only hop in the @xmath4-direction and all hopping occurs only in the @xmath79 plane , hence the 2d character .",
    "a similar argument holds for the three flavor case where in addition to the @xmath1 and @xmath3 particles , there are @xmath80- particles hopping in the @xmath76-direction",
    ".    the effective hamiltonians also contain terms arising from the on - site interaction .",
    "apart from the terms that repel atoms from each other , the symmetry of the on - site interaction allows , say , two @xmath1 particles moving in the @xmath2-direction to collide and convert into two @xmath3 particles which thereafter move off in the @xmath4-direction .",
    "the time reversed process can of course also occur .",
    "thus , the number of particles of each flavor is not conserved and there is a pairwise exchange of particles of different flavors .",
    "the anisotropy of hopping and the flavor conversion process is schematically depicted for the 2d ( two flavors ) case in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dillustr ] .",
    "particles of @xmath1 flavor are shown in gray while the @xmath3 flavor is drawn in black .",
    "below , we give the effective hamiltonians for all three different cases listed above .",

    "it is convenient to introduce for the @xmath1 flavor the creation and destruction operators @xmath84 and @xmath85 , _",

    "although this single - flavor model is equivalent to a single - flavor model in the zeroth bloch band , the additional random on - site potential resulting from residual atoms could be exploited in the study of the disordered bose - hubbard system .",
