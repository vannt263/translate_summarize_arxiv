    "a notorious hurdle in the study of lattice field theories is the phenomenon of fermion doubling .",
    "in fact , most actions containing only one fermion field per lattice site while retaining at least a remnant chiral symmetry describe several fermion species in the continuum limit .",
    "the presence of these extra degrees of freedom is , to a certain degree , unavoidable .",
    "the nielsen - ninomiya  @xcite theorem guarantees that under certain very general assumptions , chirally symmetric actions lead to a doubling of the number of fermions one would naively expect .",
    "fermion actions which bypass the nielsen - ninomiya no - go theorem are known but are computationally very expensive . for actions possessing hypercubic symmetry",
    "there is one fermion doubling for every space time direction and thus , in four dimensions , one dirac fermion on each lattice site leads to sixteen dirac fermions in the continuum limit .",
    "their use in qcd where only two ( or three ) light fermions exist is problematic . in the past ,",
    "karsten  @xcite and wilczek  @xcite have suggested four - dimensional actions with the minimal number of doublings allowed by the nielsen - ninomiya theorem , namely , one doubling , corresponding to two fermions in the continuum .",
    "unfortunately , these actions require the fine tuning of some parameters to achieve the continuum limit , which is a daunting numerical task , and have not been extensively used .",
    "the subject was recently revived with the suggestion by creutz  @xcite of a graphene inspired class of actions , some of them defined on non - hypercubic lattices , possessing both chiral symmetry and the minimal fermion doubling .",
    "soon afterwards borii  @xcite suggested a related action and clarified some points of creutz s proposal .    in this letter , we point out that these actions  @xcite break discrete symmetries like parity and time reversal and therefore when gauge interactions are included , one should expect to fine tune relevant and marginal operators in order to have a continuum limit .",
    "the need for fine tuning , of course , hinders the usability of these actions in practical calculations . before presenting a systematic analysis",
    ", it is useful to make our main point using the borii action as an example , which , in momentum space , can be written in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 this action breaks the parity symmetry , under which @xmath2 , charge conjugation , @xmath3 , and time - reversal , @xmath4 . consequently , in the effective ( symanzik ) action valid at distances larger than the lattice spacing @xmath5 but smaller than the confinement radius , the time - reversal breaking operator @xmath6 appears in the theory .",
    "this relevant operator is not part of the continuum limit of qcd and therefore requires its explicit inclusion in the action with a finely tuned coefficient .",
    "this is an example of the fine tuning problem alluded to above .",
    "the general analysis of the symmetries and the operator content of the symanzik action of these theories requires more care and is the central subject of this paper .",
    "we will see that these novel actions require multiple fine tunings of dimension three and four operators .",

    "to investigate discretization errors , we consider the continuum limit . using the seven symmetries of the borii - creutz action , it is straightforward to construct the symanzik effective theory , valid at distances larger than the lattice spacing but smaller than the confinement radius  @xcite .",

    "consider the lattice spacing and gauge coupling sufficiently small .",

    "as this action has been analyzed in detail previously  @xcite , we shall not pursue the decomposition of the fields in terms of flavor and chirality .",

    "@xmath114 invariance 3 .",
    "@xmath24 invariance 4 .",
    "@xmath115 invariance ,    where @xmath115 is the time link - reflection symmetry operator . for the borii and creutz actions ,",
    "@xmath115 is not a symmetry .",
    "given these discrete symmetries , it is straightforward to write down the relevant and marginal terms in the symanzik action .",
    "there is one relevant operator @xmath116 and several marginal operators @xmath117 as with anisotropic lattices , the breaking of hypercubic symmetry down to cubic symmetry requires a speed of light tuning .",
    "it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the relevant operator can be absorbed by a field redefinition , namely @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the non - perturbatively determined coefficient of the operator @xmath93 in the symanzik action , while @xmath120 that of @xmath121 .",
    "the field redefinition , however , modifies the boundary condition and just moves the fine tuning problem from the bulk of the action to the boundary .",
    "the physical reality of this term can be ascertained by noticing that it plays the role of an imaginary chemical potential .",
    "the relevant operator thus can not be avoided in the case of the wilczek action .",
    "we have investigated above different lattice actions with minimal fermion doubling . in particular",
    ", we demonstrated that the borii - creutz action has an exact @xmath67 chiral symmetry .",
    "for each action , however , there are relevant and marginal operators appearing in the symanzik effective theory . breaking of discrete symmetries , such as parity and time - reversal , is the culprit for the appearance of such operators .",
    "the wilczek action has the least number of such operators .",
    "a natural question arising from our analysis is whether a chirally symmetric action with minimal fermion doubling which does not generate dimension three operators is possible .",
    "this would indeed occur if such a putative action preserved @xmath122 symmetry as that symmetry is sufficient to forbid the dimension three operators listed .",
    "it is , however , easy to see that such an action does not exist . to have minimal fermion doubling , it is clear that hypercubic invariance must be broken .",
    "heuristically one can argue that parity or time - reversal must also be broken from figure  [ f : poles ] . here",
    "we plot a two - dimensional slice of momentum space .",
    "a shift in momentum space can always be made so that one pole of the propagator is at a corner of the slice depicted .",
    "poles of the propagator are shown in the case of ordinary fermion doubling , and two minimal doubling scenarios .",
    "notice that in the absence of symmetric doublers , there is always an asymmetry about one axis .",
    "hence , depending on which axis is asymmetric , either @xmath24 , or @xmath21 is broken .",
    "the dashed line shows a hypothetical scenario in which the product @xmath122 is preserved .",
    "if we write the general chirally symmetric momentum space action as @xmath123 then we require that each @xmath124 and @xmath125 be odd , e.g ..  @xmath126 , so that @xmath122 is preserved .",
    "furthermore the action must be local which requires the continuity of @xmath124 , @xmath125 and periodicity .",
    "the only odd functions which are continuous and periodic within the brillouin zone vanish at the boundaries @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( as well as at the origin ) .",
    "thus there is no @xmath122 symmetric action which has only minimal doubling .",
    "we have reasoned that chirally symmetric minimal fermion doubling requires broken @xmath24 , or @xmath21 , and broken @xmath122 . without these symmetries intact , however , dimension three operators are allowed , e.g.  @xmath129 for @xmath79 spatial , or @xmath130 in the case of broken @xmath24 , and @xmath131 for @xmath79 spatial , or @xmath132 for the case of broken @xmath21 .",
    "thus chirally symmetric minimal doubling actions , of the form considered here , require the fine tuning of relevant operators .",
    "there may be additional non - standard symmetries , however , that emerge for particular values of parameters .",
    "such symmetries are very interesting because they could potentially eliminate relevant operators .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to expose such symmetries ."
