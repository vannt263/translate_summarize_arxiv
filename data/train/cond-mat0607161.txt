    "quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) are fundamental building blocks of semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "their characteristic property is the quantization of the conductance at low temperatures , observed in very clean samples.@xcite the sensitivity of a qpc to single elementary charges placed in its proximity has been used for charge detection in quantum dots .",
    "@xcite scanning probe techniques have been employed for the local investigation of qpcs . among the experimental work",

    "@xcite    in this paper we apply scanning probe techniques to a qpc patterned with the local anodic oxidation technique on the 2deg in a gaas heterostructure .",
    "we use the conducting tip of a scanning force microscope as a local gate and measure the conductance of the qpc as a function of tip position .",
    "the tip - induced potential locally modifies the microscopic potential landscape close to the constriction . as a consequence",
    ", localized impurity sites can be discretely charged , leading to a change in the conductance .",
    "we find that the qpc is able to detect such charging events related to localized charges placed at distances up to 1 @xmath0 m away from the constriction .",
    "the observation of different characteristic functions of the tip - induced potential detected with the qpc , depending on the tip position , confirms that the observed effects are not related to a direct interaction between the scanning tip and the detector , but are mediated by charging at a different location .",
    "we also show that there is a direct relation between impurity charging and resonances in the transmission of the qpc .",
    "our data analysis shows that depending on tip position , the influence of certain impurities on the conductance can be changed by the presence of the tip , and transmission resonances can be reduced .",
    "transconductance measurements performed at low magnetic field allow to determine the exact coordinates of impurity sites , and to distinguish between charging and discharging of such sites .",
    "a similar behavior in space for different sites suggests that electrostatic coupling between different sites may be of importance .",
    "the determination of the number of impurities per area is of importance for transport measurements on semiconductor nanostructures , since charging events may negatively affect the quality of the measured data .",
    "we observe a very low density of impurity sites , below 50 per @xmath0m@xmath1 , indicating that the sample material is of very high quality .",
    "the sample has been fabricated on an algaas - gaas heterostructure containing a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) 34 nm below the surface , with density @xmath2 @xmath3 and mobility 450000 cm@xmath1/vs at 4.2 k. the nanostructure consists of a quantum dot ( not discussed here , see ref . ) and three qpcs .",
    "it has been defined by room temperature local anodic oxidation with a scanning force microscope ( sfm ) , @xcite which allows to write oxide lines on the surface of a semiconductor , below which the 2deg is depleted .",
    "figure  [ fig1](a ) is a topography image of the sample taken at the base temperature of the measurement setup ( 300 mk ) , showing the qpc and the adjacent quantum dot .",
    "the conductance of the qpc is controlled by applying a bias voltage to the areas which enclose the quantum dot , labeled `` gate 1 '' .",
    "the region marked `` gate 2 '' is biased at the same voltage as the qpc region .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] ( b ) is a conductance trace of the qpc taken with the tip placed at a distant location from the constriction .",
    "several oscillations indicating backscattering in or near the constriction can be observed on and at the onset of the first conductance plateau .",
    "the measurements were performed with a sfm in a @xmath5he cryostat with a base temperature of 300 mk .",
    "magnetic fields of up to 9 t can be applied normal to the plane of the 2deg .",
    "the scanning sensor consists of an electrochemically sharpened ptir tip ( with a typical diameter of 30 - 60 nm for this experiment ) , mounted on a piezoelectric quartz tuning fork .",
    "details of the low - temperature sfm , as well as of the scanning sensors can be found in refs . and .",
    "the presence of the tip induces a local potential in the 2deg , whose strength and sign depends on the applied bias voltage .",
    "no electron flow between the tip and the 2deg is possible , since the vacuum gap between the tip and the surface , and the insulating barrier of 34 nm between 2deg and surface form an insulating barrier .",
    "moving the tip in the vicinity of the qpc leads to changes in its conductance due to the capacitive coupling between the tip and the 2deg .",
    "the scanning gate images presented in this paper are obtained by scanning the tip at a fixed tip - sample separation of about 60 nm and at a fixed tip bias voltage over the area around the qpc .",
    "the conductance has been measured either by applying an ac bias voltage of 100 @xmath0v across the qpc and measuring the current with lock - in technique , or by applying an ac bias ( in addition to a dc bias ) on the scanning tip , and measuring the induced current through the qpc biased with a dc voltage ( transconductance ) .    from other measurements performed during the same cool - down of the sample ( ref . )",
    "it is clear that a double tip is present , with different contact potential differences .",
    "sem images of the tip taken after the experiment confirmed the presence of a particle of different material close to the apex of the tip .",
    "the contact potential difference arises from the work function difference between ptir and gaas and from the fermi level pinning at the gaas surface .",
    "the contact potential difference was determined during previous measurements,@xcite using the quantum dot as a detector . in that case , the tip is scanned along a line close to the dot for different tip bias voltages . since the dot is tuned in the coulomb blockade regime , the conductance resonances observed in the linescan correspond to lines of constant energy .",
    "if the position of these lines does not change with tip position , the selected tip bias voltage exactly compensates the contact potential difference .",
    "the contact potential difference of one tip is 550 mv , while the other tip has a contact potential difference close to 0 mv . by performing the same linescan measurement on the qpc",
    ", the contact potential differences are found to be @xmath6 = 200 mv and @xmath7 = -1700 v. they were obtained by determining the tip voltage necessary to keep the qpc conductance constant , when the tip was moved from a distant location to a position on top of the constriction .",
    "@xcite the measurement is displayed in fig .",
    "the contact potential differences are compensated at a voltage scale , which is outside the area of the plot , and have been obtained by fitting a curve with the same shape as the black parabolae in fig .  2 at a conductance level corresponding to the background conductance .",

    "we identify two different effects of the scanning tip on the conductance of the qpc . the straightforward way to understand the influence of the tip on the qpc is to consider it as an additional gate , which shifts the energies of the quantized modes .",
    "this leads to large conductance changes ( as already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and can be modeled in terms of elementary electrostatics .",
    "we call this the _ gating effect _ of the tip .",
    "the second effect leads to much more subtle features , which can be barely recognized without further data analysis , and form sets of concentric conductance steps ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) around different centers .",
    "these features can be found up to 1 @xmath0 m away from the qpc constriction .",

    "the remaining right part of the figure shows a strong increase in conductance , with some oscillations , due to the presence of the tip with a ( positive ) effective voltage of 1300 mv .",
    "the oscillations can be matched quite exactly with the transmission resonances observed on the conductance trace in ( a ) .",
    "thus , the tip , acting as an external gate shifts the position of the conductance trace of the qpc to lower or higher gate voltages .",
    "it is possible to verify this effect with a model of the tip - induced potential .",

    "the conductance of the qpc for a certain position of the tip can then be written as @xmath12&=&g\\left [ v_{gate 1 } + ( v_{tip_{1}}-v_{cpd}^{tip_{1}})\\alpha_{tip_{1}}(\\vec{r}_{tip } ) \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left .",

    "low- and high pass filtering using fourier transform did not lead to satisfactory results , since it is hard to define a cut - off frequency , without cutting useful data .",

    "the base functions are generated by scaling and translating a fast decaying function with vanishing average .",
    "the base wavelet used here is the haar wavelet , which is basically a square cosine wave of one period .",
    "the filtering procedure works as follows : a complete set of linescans is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] on the left .",
    "fig [ fig6 ] ( left ) shows that the positions of the local maxima change with tip position following lines parallel to the dotted black line on the left , and lines 1 and 2 .",
    "these maxima correspond to a single conductance resonance maximum , and are due to the gating effect of the tip , since they are also parallel to the onset where the qpc starts to conduct [ light blue region in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] . some of the lines ( e.g. lines 3 and 4 ) , however , follow a different path , indicating that the lever arm of the tip on that specific corresponding resonance is different than for other resonances of the qpc .",
    "the lever arm is always larger , up to three times , but never smaller than for the qpc related resonances .",
    "the effect is also observable on the conductance traces of the qpc : most of the resonances shift their position in gate voltage together with the shift in voltage of the overall conductance of the qpc , if the tip position is changed .",
    "the resonances related to different lever arms on the other hand tend to migrate from one position to the other , in a way , which is much more extreme than for the other curves .",
    "transmission resonances in qpcs are thought to be caused by a spatially fluctuating potential in the channel or close to the constriction .",
    "these fluctuations in the potential can have their origin in a roughness of the constriction , or in individual scatterers placed close to it .",
    "our measurements suggest that localized scatterers can be one of the origins of the observed transmission resonances , and that the scanning tip is able to strongly modify the scattering configuration , leading to position dependent effects of the resonances .",
    "an additional observation which may support the argument about localized charges , is that single resonances can be made to disappear , if the tip is placed at certain positions .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] , displays some of these events .",

    "[ fig4 ] , which are barely visible in the raw data obtained from scanning gate images .",
    "however , a higher resolution can be obtained by measuring the transconductance . in this case an ac voltage of 50 mv at a frequency of 80 hz is applied to the tip in addition to a dc voltage , and the current through the qpc is detected with lock - in technique at that frequency .",
    "small changes in conductance can be detected with enhanced resolution . by comparing transconductance measurements with the previous conductance data differentiated in scan direction mathematically [ fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ( a ) ] , one can see the improvement in resolution . in order to reduce the influence of the transmission resonances ,",

    "a profile taken through the scanning gate image ( c ) clearly shows the large current resolution and current peaks corresponding to positive and negative current through the qpc .",
    "the lines marked with a - c are discussed in fig .",
    "the circle mark the crossing points between charging events and the lines a - c.,width=226 ]    a dark ring corresponds to a conductance decrease ( or negative current ) and thus an electron added to an impurity site , while a light ring corresponds to the opposite situation , where an electron is made to leave the site .",
    "interestingly , no particular ring shows both situations on the same contour , i.e. , charging and uncharging events do not appear on the same ring . the profile curve [ fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ( c ) ] clearly shows the different charging events , where a dip corresponds to charging and a peak to uncharging of an impurity site .",
    "if every ring is assumed to correspond to an impurity site , its position can easily be determined by fitting the contour line with an ellipse , at which center ( the center is taken to be the intersection of the main axes ) the exact position is expected . by counting the number of centers per area , we obtain a density of about 50 centers per @xmath0m@xmath1 .",
    "this number is very little , if compared to typical doping densities , which are of the order of @xmath15 per @xmath0m@xmath1 , and thus proves that the sample used is of very high quality .",
    "evolution of the lines corresponding to charging events with tip bias , if the tip is scanned along the lines a - c of fig .",
    "the numbers give the lever arm of the tip with respect to the lever arm measured from the gating effect . the circle in a highlights a set of charging events which can be either related to sequential charging of the same site , or to a coupling between two different sites.,width=226 ]    however , already",
    "a small density of impurities like those observed here is able to induce changes in the transport current measured through the qpc , in the sense that additional transmission resonances appear , which depend on the charge on such an impurity .",
    "considering the low density , they may originate from doping atoms , which are located away from position of the maximum doping density and whose ground state energy is close to the electrochemical potential of the electrons in the 2deg .",
    "this has to be the case , since the electric field of the tip is effectively screened by the gaas cap layer , which has a relatively high dielectric constant ( @xmath16 ) , and the possible energy changes which can be induced are expected to be below 20 mev from simulations , at the level of the doping plane .",
    "the presence of such charges in the vicinity of quantum dots could also be an explanation for sudden changes in the conductance due to parametric charge rearrangements .",
    "the energy dependence of such charging events can be extracted by scanning the tip on a line placed over a region where many impurity sites are observed , and by repeating the scans for different tip voltages .",
    "the position of the contour lines is then tracked , as shown in fig .",
    "the linescans have been performed on the lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , and marked a ",
    "c . by changing the tip bias voltage , the size of the rings changes in a way , which is expected from measurements on quantum dots @xcite .",
    "we observe linear change in tip bias , and the extracted rate is proportional to the lever arms obtained from the linescans presented above , ranging from 2 to about 12 mv / nm .",
    "a rather particular event appears in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] a , where a set of two contour lines seems to be coupled ( circle in a ) .",
    "this behavior could be due either to two sequential charging events of the same impurity site , or to coupling between different sites , as observed from coupled quantum dots .",
    "@xcite the first assumption is the most reasonable , since the lever arm of the tip is almost the same for both events , and a small roughness in the confining potential of that specific site could easily lead to a smaller spacing between charging events .",
    "coupling between different sites leading to the anticrossing behavior observed would require two different sites with probably two different lever arms , which are not observed .",
    "in this paper , we have reported the detection of charging events of impurity sites by a scanning probe at a temperature of 300 mk . the method allows to extract the position of such sites and to determine their density , by using a qpc placed nearby as a sensitive charge detector . by varying the voltage applied on the scanning tip",
    ", we were able to determine the energy dependence of the charging events on the position of the tip .",
    "we have found that conductance resonances , which are a typical effect of a one - dimensional channel with backscattering , can be influenced by selectively perturbing the charging sites . from this",
    "we can conclude that such impurities can in general affect transport measurements in semiconductor nanostructures , and can be related to parametric charge rearrangements often observed in quantum dot measurements . their low density , on the other hand , and the relatively small changes induced in transport , are a sign of the very high quality of the sample used ."
