    "the study of long memory processes @xcite is an old story .",
    "when sampling the same population at different point in times , @xmath4 , we often hope and assume that the time - average reflects the local average , @xmath5 the central limit theorem tells us that this is indeed true if @xmath6 are identically distributed and are independent .",
    "the variance is then inversely proportional with time , the sample size , and thus decay .",
    "this fact remains true even when @xmath6 have weak correlations such as an exponential decay @xcite .",
    "this universality of the inverse proportionality with the sample size , breaks down when the correlations are stronger and decay polynomially .",
    "this phenomena of long range dependence is very well studied in many areas of physics , from statistical physics to quantum field theory .    in statistics ,",
    "many classes of gaussian processes with long - range depency have been studied throughout history .",
    "one of the most studied and well known is certainly fractional brownian motion .",
    "these processes were first introduced by kolmogorov in 1940 when investigating turbulences .",
    "perhaps it is benoit mandelbrot who truly recognized the importance of the fractional brownian motion . in 1965",
    ", he published his insights on the work of the hydrologist harold erwin hurst , who observed discrepancies in the yearly variation of the levels of the nile river @xcite .        using a fractional integration of the brownian motion ,",
    "the following process @xmath7 is introduced , @xmath8 the constant @xmath9 is also known as the hurst index . for @xmath10",
    "this reduces to regular brownian motion .    with the rise of computational power",
    ", new methods were developped for simulating condensed matter .",
    "the challenge faced in such system was the exponentially growing number of parameters .",
    "solutions were presented in the form of various ansatz states @xcite .",
    "these states were constructed from networks of tensors with a particular geometry .    in 2005 , vidal presented an tensor network ansatz reminiscent of renormalization to simulate quantum critical systems @xcite . while being mostly used for numerics , such scheme sparks various interests in other areas such as high energy physics @xcite etc ... a continuum version was presented in 2010 by haegemann et .",
    "al . @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we show that fractional brownian motion can be related with such networks ( [ fig : circuit],[fig : mera ] ) .",
    "we start from a discrete process @xmath11 with a joint probability distribution @xmath12 represented by a certain network . under renormalization of the parameters of the network , we prove that the process @xmath13 is precisely a fractional brownian motion",
    ". the networks also yield a new representation of fractional brownian motion .    in the first part",
    ", we construct a new network with an underlying causal structure which follows from a renormalization flow .",
    "we will show that this network generates fractional brownian motion .",
    "the starting point of this work is the relationship between fractional brownian motion and renormalization @xcite .",
    "based on this knowledge , we also discuss the use of mera for simulating such processes .",
    "while a mera is more challenging to derive analitically , we can calibrate the parameters numerically .",
    "it turns out that the mera structure offers the possibility of simulating such gaussian processes more efficiently , @xmath14 , than the regular methods such as the choleksy decompositon or circulant methods @xcite .",
    "the two networks ( [ fig : mera],[fig : circuit ] ) presented in this work differ in the direction of the renormalization flow . while for mera the real space is renormalized in the virtual space , this is quite the opposite in the second network .",
    "by compounding or integrating familar processes , staticians derive new ones with new desired properties .",
    "the use of processes with simple distributions , such as gaussian distributions , also permits the efficient simulations of the processes without having the derive the distribution of the new process .",
    "sometimes , however , the opposite direction is necessary .",
    "this allows for a change of measure , which can further simplify the process .",
    "the most famous example is the so - called girsanov theorem , which allows to eliminate the drift from a brownian motion by change of measure @xcite .",
    "time series @xcite such as arima , arfima , etc ... , are succesful techniques for tackling memory .",
    "these processes make use of the increments of a one - dimensional brownian motion up to some time @xmath15 , @xmath16 at each later time , new increments are added . in the era of tensor networks , besides the real , here time- , axis additional virtual dimensions are added .",
    "these new axes potentially and seemingly add new parameters , but present us with new insights in such processes .",
    "the goals of this section is to discuss the expansion of the joint probability distribution @xmath17 of the increments @xmath18 of a process @xmath19 as a circuit of conditional probabilities .",
    "the circuit is set up along a virtual dimension , which we denote as @xmath20 .",
    "the final output of the circuit is at @xmath21 , which is then the seeked probability .",
    "@xmath22 both networks are intrinsically connected with renormalization . the first circuit ( [ fig : circuit ] ) has a natural causal structure and is discussed in the next section .",
    "we will also display the power of an already known network , mera , shown in figure ( [ fig : mera ] ) .",
    "our approach in section ( [ section : numerical ] ) is then purely numerical .      in 1966 , leo p. kadanoff proposed the `` block - spin '' renormalization group in his study of phase transitions of the ising model .",
    "he hypothesized that because spins would line up in large blocks near the critical points , then neighbouring spins can be regrouped and treated as a single entity .",
    "this ansatz allowed him to rederive scaling laws near the critical point .",
    "one of the properties of fractional brownian motion is the self - similarity of the process , @xmath23 where the equality is understood as in distribution .",
    "this scaling property fits perfectly with the philosophy of kadanoff s renormalization on a tree .",
    "if some parameter @xmath24 describes some group of tensors from a virtual time @xmath25 to @xmath20 , then according to kadanoff it should be a related by a rescaling when the block is made larger , @xmath26    ) .",

    "<S> we derive fractional brownian motion and stochastic processes with multifractal properties using a framework of network of gaussian conditional probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the derivation of new representations of fractional brownian motion . </S>",
    "<S> these constructions are inspired from renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this paper consists of constructing each increment of the process from two - dimensional gaussian noise inside the light - cone of each seperate increment . </S>",
    "<S> not only does this allows us to derive fractional brownian motion , we can introduce extensions with multifractal flavour . in another part of this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the use of the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) , introduced in the study critical systems in quantum spin lattices , as a method for sampling integrals with respect to such multifractal processes . </S>",
    "<S> after proper calibration , a mera promises the generation of a sample of size @xmath0 of a multifractal process in the order of @xmath1 , an improvement over the known methods , such as the cholesky decomposition and the circulant methods , which scale between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>"
