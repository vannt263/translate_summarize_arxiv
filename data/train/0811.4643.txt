    "moreover , we mention the charge distribution in the co phase .",
    "@xmath17 is determined by the charge density of the on - site v because contribution from the surrounding oxygen sites is small .",
    "the fact is easily seen by comparing @xmath17 for magnetic v@xmath21o@xmath3 pyramids and nonmagnetic v@xmath22o@xmath3 pyramids : @xmath17 observed in cav@xmath2o@xmath3 and v@xmath2o@xmath3 , are 0.97 and 0.06 mhz , respectively.@xmath23 in @xmath0-ag@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 the values of @xmath17 for the three v sites have the intermediate values ( 0.27 to 0.44 mhz ) in the co phase , suggesting that each magnetic site possesses low charge density of 1/2 to 1/4 . the ratio of the weight is estimated as 5:3:5 for the v1 , v2 and v3 sites , respectively .",
    "the facts suggest that the charge distribution is roughly equal for the three v sites , respectively . to maintain the electrical neutrality , a 3d@xmath5 electron exists per six v sites ,",

    "simultaneously , the value of @xmath18 also enhances below @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "10(b ) ) , reflecting that the distortion of the lattice is caused in the co phase .",
    "\\(ii ) the efg tensor of the v2 sites shows only slight change throughout the @xmath32 range between 30k and 300k ( fig .",
    "\\(iii ) the efg tensor of the v3 sites is the most isotropic , namely , @xmath18 is the smallest among the three v sites ( fig .",
    "the value of @xmath17 for the v3 sites is almost constant in the metallic phase and becomes a little bit larger below @xmath33 for all principle axes.(fig .",

    "t_. on the other hand , @xmath18 and the symmetry of the efg tensor show the different feature for each vi site .      based on the analysis above mentioned , the v1 and v3 sites seem to be in a similar local environment .",
    "this behavior is also seen in the zfr spectrum in the af phase ; the peaks at 21.50 and 24.75 mhz are located on very close positions as well as 71.25 and 73.00 mhz , suggesting that they originate from the magnetic v1-v3 rungs .",
    "we assigned the peaks at 21.50 and 71.25 mhz to the magnetic v1 sites and those at 24.75 mhz and 73.00 mhz to the magnetic v3 sites .",
    "the other signals at 48.00 and 98.75 mhz are attributed to the two v2s sites .",
    "we discuss the local spin alignment in the af phase using the zfr frequencies .",
    "zfr frequency @xmath34 is proportional to the internal field @xmath35 at each v site , i.e. @xmath36 . the internal field @xmath35 is composed of fermi - contact field @xmath37 and dipole field @xmath38 : @xmath39 , where we neglected the hyperfine field due to the spin - orbit interaction by considering the g value for the isomorphic @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 observed in the esr measurements.@xmath40 @xmath41 is expressed using expectation value of spin at a v site @xmath42 , and hyperfine coupling defined as a magnetic field arising from one bore magnetron .",
    "when we denote hyperfine coupling of @xmath37 as @xmath43 , and dipole coupling as @xmath44 and @xmath45 for spin parallel and perpendicular to the efg maximum , @xmath46 is written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is a reduction factor due to the covalent effect with oxygen , and @xmath50 is the angle between spin and the efg maximum .",

    "13 shows the @xmath50 dependence of the resonance frequency calculated with eqs .",
    "( 3)-(6 ) for integers",
    "the signals below 24.75 mhz are out of the fitting curve for @xmath59 , while the signals above 71.25 mhz are out of the fitting curve for @xmath60 .",
    "thus the value of n is uniquely determined as 2 .",
    "this result is consistent with the @xmath4v - nmr analysis . as a result",
    ", a 3d@xmath5 electron is shared within two v sites .",
    "two values of @xmath50 are calculated to be @xmath61=@xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the v1 , v2 and v3 sites , respectively .",
    "the fact that a 3d@xmath5 electron is shared within two v sites originates from relationship between hopping and coulomb repulsions between neighboring sites .",
    "formation of the cdw may be pointed out as another possibility .",
    "however , the insulating phase of @xmath0-sr@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 is hardly explained by the nesting of fermi surface ; several pressure - induced insulating phases accompanied with superstructures were observed without the changes of crystal structure and carrier number .",
    "it is unlikely that all of the phases arise from the nesting of fermi surface because the crystal structure is unchanged .",
    "there are two possibilities for a 3d@xmath5 electron shared within two v sites ; one is sharing within a rung , and the other is sharing within a leg . in the latter model ,",
    "the charge would be distributed to only one side of the v1 or v3 sites according to the crystal symmetry .",
    "the latter model conflicts with the analysis of @xmath4v - nmr and zfr measurements , in which charge density is almost the same for the v1 and v3 sites .",
    "therefore , our experimental results suggest charge sharing within a rung . when @xmath65 ( @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ) represents the co state where a 3d@xmath5 electron with up spin ( @xmath68 ) is located on a site as shown in fig .",
    "14 , a 3d@xmath5 electron shared within a rung is expressed as @xmath69 where @xmath29 is an arbitrary number , but the energy depends on its value , as do the charge densities ; an appreciable energy difference can be expected between the bonding state ( @xmath70)and the anti - bonding state ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the occupation of the bonding state would have more charge in - between the two v sites and lead to a strong coupling to phonons .",
    "this would locally favor a shortening of the rung .",
    "spin ordering model .",
    "@xmath72,width=294 ]    the expectation values of @xmath73 are derived from @xmath74 and @xmath75 as follows , @xmath76    note that the magnitude and direction of @xmath77 should be the same for the two sites .",
    "the spin directions from [ 1 , 0 , -1 ] are indicated by the sum of @xmath78 , the angle between the first principle axis of efg and [ 1 , 0 , -1 ] , and @xmath50 , the angle between the first principle axis of efg and spin direction : @xmath79 .",
    "the angles are estimated as 94 and 101 degrees for one rungs , and 145 and 156 degrees for the other rungs , respectively , making the difference less than about 10 degrees .",
    "the directions are shown in fig . 15 .",
    "one of the spin moment turns to the bottom plane of the vo@xmath3 pyramid , and the other the direction of about 30 degrees from the apical direction of the pyramid .",
    "similar situation holds for the v2 sites as shown in fig .",
    "15 ; the two directions are estimated to be 76 and 121 degrees .",
    "one may point out that possible directions of @xmath77 could be out of the ac plane .",
    "such a situation is hardly expected if charge sharing within a rung is realized and the directions of @xmath77 are the same within a rung ; experimentally , the directions obtained independently for the v1 and v3 sites agree with each other only when they align in the ac plane .",
    "the spin moments with the opposite direction also satisfies eq .",
    "( 3 ) , which makes the antiferromagnetic alignment possible in the af phase .",
    "the existence of two kinds of spin moments for each vi site is attributed to the crystallographical peculiarity in the co phase : x - ray diffraction revealed the sixfold lattice modulation along the b axis making locally inequivalent pyramid structure on the vi site . therefore two v1-v3 rungs located on crystalographically inequivalent position would make two kinds of spin directions .",
    "the two v2s rungs are located on equivalent positions .",
    "two sets of v2-v2 magnetic rungs would be induced by local arrangement of the v1-v3 magnetic rungs , although two v2-v2 rungs are located on equivalent positions .    to maintain electrical neutrality",
    ", the ratio of magnetic rung and nonmagnetic rung should be 1 to 2 .",
    "the magnetic rungs are expected to align with threefold lattice periodicity to avoid coulomb repulsion .",
    "this threefold charge periodicity has also been reported for @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "however , the charge - distribution pattern is different ; @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 consists of two magnetic rungs and a nonmagnetic rung .",
    "the reason why the charge - distribution pattern differs depending on materials is not certain at present .",
    "the charge distribution may be sensitive to the relationship between hopping and repulsion and as a result depends on detailed environments of the materials .",
    "the directions of @xmath42 obtained for each vi site independently.,width=264 ]     scheme of charge - sharing within a rung .",
    "( a ) rungs with @xmath80 are isolated in every three lattices along the leg due to coulomb interaction for @xmath0-a@xmath81@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 , giving a reason why the ground state of @xmath0-ag@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 is magnetic .",
    "( b ) two rungs exist on the nearest positions along the leg for @xmath0-a@xmath82@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 , which could cause singlet pairing .",
    "the scenario explains phenomenologically why the ground state of @xmath0-sr@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 is a singlet.,width=264 ]    the idea of charge sharing within a rung like hydrogen molecule is rather promising to understand why the ground state of @xmath0-ag@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 is an af ordering state , whereas that of @xmath0-sr@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 is a singlet state .",
    "the former includes a magnetic rung with s=1/2 aligned in every three rungs along the leg direction ( fig .",
    "16(a ) ) , then coupling of two rungs seems difficult because such rungs would be located on isolated positions to avoid coulomb interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter includes one nonmagnetic rungs in every three rungs along the leg direction . as a results",
    "two rungs with s=1/2 are located on the nearest neighboring positions ( fig .",
    "16(b ) ) , therefore singlet formation accompanied with lattice distortion would decrease the total energy . in real material",
    ", situation may be much complicated , however , essential property may be explained by the charge sharing .",
    "we measured @xmath4v nmr and zfr on @xmath0-ag@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 to investigate local properties of spin and charge for three inequivalent vi sites ( i=1 , 2 , and 3 ) .",
    "the principal axes of the efg tensor were identified for the three phases , namely the metallic phase at _ t _ above and below cation ordering temperature , the charge - ordering phase , and antiferromagnetic odering phase .",
    "we found that the efg for the v1 sites shows similar behavior to that for the v3 sites .",
    "the similarity was also observed as pairs of signals closely located in zfr spectra .",
