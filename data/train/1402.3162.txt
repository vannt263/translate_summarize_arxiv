    "one of the key properties of a quantum field theory is its vacuum structure .",
    "already , in the famous `` mexican hat '' of the higgs potential , the vacuum presents us with non - trivial geometry . in general , the classical expectation values of scalar fields can parameterize intricate manifolds called the vacuum moduli space ( vms ) , which are then quantum mechanically corrected . in field theories with supersymmetry , where there is an abundance of these scalar fields , the vms generically assumes interesting and complicated forms .",
    "one could exploit this `` vacuum '' geometry , for example , to investigate phenomenological issues ; this was a programme launched in @xcite , where sometimes unexpected geometrical signatures are found in the standard model . in the context of string theory , realizations and interpretations of the algebraic geometry of the vacuum as",
    "the low - energy limit of a compactification or holographic scenario is key to the `` geometrical engineering '' of field theories @xcite . with the advances in computer algebra and modern algebraic geometry @xcite - of whose powers",
    "we will make extensive here - the algorithmic _ geometry of gauge theories _ is now a fruitful enterprise @xcite .",
    "recently , efficient and highly parallelizable methods of numerical algebraic geometry have been applied to studying the vms @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most studied class of supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions are the so - called _ quiver gauge theories _ , whose matter content and superpotential can be encoded into a finite graph whose nodes represent factors in a product gauge group and whose arrows , bi - fundamental and adjoint fields . via higgsing and addition of flavour nodes , more general types of fields",
    "can also be incorporated .",
    "the reason for focusing on these theories over the last two decades is two - fold : ( 1 ) the product gauge group structure is clearly an important step toward standard - model building and ( 2 ) the _ generic _ quantum field theory engineered from string theory , especially from holography ( ads / cft ) , is of quiver type .",
    "while steady progress has been made to understand the classification of @xmath4 four - dimensional gauge theories , particularly of ( generalized ) quiver type @xcite , the perhaps more phenomenologically interesting @xmath0 theories presently proliferate wildly beyond control .",
    "nevertheless , some progress has been made in organizing @xmath0 quiver theories by introducing appropriate `` order parameters '' , be they block - structures @xcite , geometric invariants such as the hilbert series @xcite , or combinatorics of finite directed graphs @xcite .    by far the most studied and understood class of super - conformal quiver theories are those whose moduli space is a ( non - compact ) toric calabi - yau variety , notably of complex dimension three @xcite . here , the virtues of toric geometry engenders a bipartite - graphic description of the gauge theory @xcite . from a computational point of view , the moduli spaces are easier to handle in the toric case because the gauge groups are abelian and the fields are simply complex numbers rather than complex matrices .",
    "thus , we are working over polynomial rings over the complex numbers and all the technology of algebraic geometry naturally applies .    bearing the above points in mind - the relevance of the vms ,",
    "the efficacy of computational geometry and the ubiquity of quivers - a natural question arises : what is the _ typical _ supersymmetric vacuum ? we are reminded of and motivated by a similar problem in pure geometry . whereas algebraic curves are topologically classified by genus ,",
    "surfaces and higher dimensional varieties thus far defy a complete catalogue . even in @xmath5 , there are cases not yet known concerning the existence of curves of given genus and degree ( cf .",
    "18 of iv of @xcite ) .",
    "we shall thus take a statistical approach , using toric quiver gauge theories as a testing ground , and map out the cartography , with identifiers such as dimension , degree , and hilbert series , of the space of vms .",
    "thence , we will have hint at what the `` typical '' vacuum of a gauge theory might be",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : pre ] , we describe in detail the quiver gauge theories of our study .",
    "we then discuss how the vacuum space can be expressed as an algebraic variety via calculating relevant gauge invariants in section [ s : vac ] .",
    "an outline of the algorithms used to generate both the quiver theories and relevant statistics is given in section [ s : alg ] .",
    "a selection of our catalogued results are presented for an initial test collection and further generalised to a larger group of non - toric theories .",
    "we illustrate in section [ s : compu ] the vms landscape with distributions of vacuum spaces with respect to both degree and dimension .",
    "we also collect the hilbert series data in a vast catalogue for the vms .",
    "finally , we conclude with prospects in section [ s : conc ] .",
    "we begin with a brief review of our illustrative class of quantum field theories , namely supersymmetric gauge theories which afford quiver description .",
    "such theories are generically expected to have non - trivial ( and often calabi - yau ) vacuum geometry .",
    "quivers provide a convenient representation of the particle content of gauge theories that describes d - branes on orbifolds @xcite .",
    "a @xmath6 , q , is a finite directed multigraph where each node represents a compact gauge factor @xmath7 of the total gauge group @xmath8 .",
    "nodes are customarily labeled by the index @xmath9 of these gauge factors .",
    "the edges represent bi - fundamental fields , those which transform under ( @xmath10 ) where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the head and tail gauge groups respectively .",
    "we denote these fields by @xmath13 for fields charged under @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively whilst multiplicities are indexed by @xmath16 .",
    "self - loops , where the head and tail gauge groups coincide , are fields transforming under the usual adjoint representation @xmath17 that we denote by @xmath18 .",
    "the gauge invariant terms are constructed by contracting the gauge indices between fields hence they correspond to closed paths in the quiver .",
    "a generating set for these invariants is easily obtained from the quiver without adjoints by taking the simple cycles . however ,",
    "when self - loops are present , additional terms including the adjoint fields must be included among the gauge invariants .",
    "henceforth we shall refer to minimal loops in reference to this expanded set of cycles .",
    "a @xmath19 is a pair @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the superpotential defining the theory .",
    "the superpotential is a formal polynomial in the edges of the quiver where each monomial term is gauge invariant .",
    "hence the superpotential takes the form @xmath22 where in general @xmath23 . allowing for fractional branes one can choose the ranks of the nodes freely and",
    "the fields are matrices . in the following we consider gauge groups of the form @xmath24 describing a single brane - probe where all the representations are one dimensional .",
    "this introduces a significant redundancy in the number of possible superpotentials for each quiver diagram due to the commutativity of the fields .",
    "we consider @xmath25 quivers : these are where the vacuum space is calabi - yau .",
    "a sufficient condition is that the theory is anomaly - free , a requirement independent of the superpotential .",
    "it can be stated as a restriction on the quiver diagram : a quiver theory is calabi - yau if all nodes have indegree equal to the outdegree .",
    "a toric quiver theory can be defined as a theory in which each field appears exactly twice in the superpotential in separate terms where the terms have opposite sign .",
    "this  toric condition \" was first discussed in @xcite and then used to construct bipartite models in @xcite .",
    "the condition ensures that the moduli space is a toric variety .",
    "for additional details we refer the reader to the books @xcite and the physics review paper @xcite .",
    "we relax the toric condition in our investigations and consider any polynomials in the gauge invariants as possible superpotentials .",
    "we consider a general gauge theory with @xmath26 supersymmetry . in the presence of a ( compact ) gauge group @xmath27 we have chiral superfields @xmath28 transforming under @xmath27 and a vector superfield @xmath29 transforming under the lie algebra of @xmath27 .    the standard action @xcite in terms of superspace coordinates is @xmath30 , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the gauge field strength and @xmath32 is the superpotential which is a holomorphic function of the chiral superfields .",
    "we note that any quadratic terms in the superpotential can be integrated out so we only consider monomials of cubic and higher order .    in the usual way",
    ", we calculate the conditions on the classical vacuum state in the wess - zumino gauge .",
    "it reduces to two types of conditions on the scalar components @xmath33 of the chiral superfields @xmath28 .",
    "we must satisfy the following : @xmath34 @xmath35 these are the f - flatness and d - flatness conditions .",
    "the space of solutions to these flatness conditions can be parameterised by an algebraic variety .",
    "having introduced our chief class of field theories , we now move on to explicitly describe the mathematical technique of computing the vms .",
    "the tool we will employ is _ computational algberaic geometry _ of affine varieties .",
    "since we will be viewing vacuum space in terms of algebraic geometry we briefly introduce some necessary terminology .",
    "the fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic sets , that is , sets of solutions to polynomial equations .",
    "let @xmath36 be an algebraically closed field .",
    "we introduce an @xmath37 , @xmath38 , as the locus of points in the affine space @xmath39 on which a set of polynomials vanish .",
    "so we have @xmath40 henceforth we shall set @xmath41 as relevant to this work .",
    "it is well known that we can describe any submanifold of @xmath39 with a finite set of polynomials .",
    "the geometric properties of an affine variety can be encoded in its coordinate ring .",
    "associated with @xmath42 we have the polynomial ring @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "we take the ideal generated by the set of polynomials defining @xmath38 which we denote by @xmath44 for brevity . since @xmath44 is an ideal we take the quotient @xmath43/i(x)$ ] as our primary object associated with the variety .",
    "tools of algebraic geometry allow one to extract geometric data from this ring .",
    "for example , the @xmath45 of the space has numerous equivalent definitions including the usual krull dimension of the quotient ring .",
    "the @xmath46 is closely related to the number of intersection points of the variety with a straight line but the detailed definition is not required for our analysis .",
    "it is possible to define regular maps @xmath47 between varieties which are given by @xmath48 polynomials on the points of @xmath38 whose images lie in @xmath49 .",
    "these induce maps on the polynomials rings ( often written again using the same symbol ) which is actually the pullback @xmath50/i(y)\\rightarrow \\mathbb{c}[x_{1},\\cdots , x_{n}]/i(x)$ ] defined by @xmath51 .",
    "we note given two varieties @xmath38 and @xmath49 we can define a product @xmath52 which is also a variety .",
    "let @xmath53 and @xmath54 be varieties defined by the sets of polynomials @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "we have @xmath57 the quotient ring associated with this variety is simply @xmath58/(i(x)+i(y ) ) .",
    "\\label{eq7}\\ ] ]    we note some further structure relevant to later discussion .",
    "consider a regular map on a product variety @xmath59 that is a cartesian product of functions @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the image of this map is clearly the product variety @xmath63 equivalently the coordinate ring map we defined earlier has the domain @xmath58/(i(\\im(d_{1}))+\\im(d_{2}))).\\ ] ]      exploiting the extra gauge invariance of the action eq.([eq2 ] ) allows one to write the space of vacuum solutions as a symplectic quotient and hence an algebraic variety . for a more detailed discussion of the main points we refer the reader to the original paper containing these results @xcite .",
    "we can introduce a less restrictive gauge in which the invariance under the complexified gauge group @xmath64 remains .",
    "the f - terms are covariant under the imaginary part of the gauge group since the superpotential is a holomorphic function of terms with a gauge index .",
    "hence under this transformation of a solution the f - flatness conditions remained satisfied .    for every f - term solution",
    "there is only one d - term solution .",
    "under the imaginary part of the gauge group we can rotate the solution on a d - orbit which contains exactly one solution to the d - terms .",
    "hence we have the fact that the vacuum moduli space is given by the symplectic quotient @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the f - term solution manifold .    now using some standard results we relate this to variety .",
    "first we notice @xmath66 can be naturally viewed as an affine variety since it corresponds to points at which the polynomial conditions of eq.([eq3 ] ) vanish in @xmath42 , where @xmath67 refers to the number of fields .",
    "so we have the polynomial ring @xmath68/\\langle\\partial_{i}w\\rangle$ ] .",
    "lutty and taylor @xcite highlight the fact that given @xmath66 as a variety there is a bijection between eq.([eq8 ] ) and the variety defined by the ring of gauge invariant elements in the ring @xmath66 .    so taking the minimal generating set of gauge invariants",
    "@xmath69 we need the image of this map in @xmath70 .",
    "the vacuum moduli space is @xmath71    given the original ingredients of the gauge invariants or minimal loops of the quiver and f - flatness conditions we can calculate features of the vacuum moduli space ( vms ) .",
    "this technique is sometimes referred to as a version of the @xmath72 .",
    "we utilise macaulay2 functions to calculate the ideal of the ring map associated to eq.([eq9 ] ) , namely @xmath73 .",
    "this gives the ideal in @xmath74 defining the vacuum space .",
    "there are inbuilt functions to calculate the dimension , degree and hilbert series of the associated variety in the standard sense .",
    "we consider a disconnected quiver diagram with connected components @xmath75 and associated fields @xmath76 .",
    "the sets of minimal loops and hence gauge invariants can be partitioned into sets associated with each connected component .",
    "thus , a superpotential takes the form @xmath77 .",
    "the algebraic variety is thus a product @xmath78 and the map @xmath79 defined by the gauge invariants is a cartesian product of the maps on each @xmath80 .    by our earlier discussion of these types of maps in eq.([eq7 ] ) , we know the image of the gauge invariants calculated using eq.([eq9 ] ) will be a product of the images of the @xmath80 in @xmath81 .",
    "thus we present results only for connected quiver theories .",
    "our strategy is to use the following procedure to generate the statistics in a systematic manner :    1 .   given a pair of integers @xmath82 generate every unique quiver ( excluding disconnected quivers ) with @xmath67 nodes and @xmath83 edges that satisfies the calabi - yau conditions .",
    "2 .   for each quiver",
    "generate all the possible minimal loops of the quiver corresponding to the gauge invariants .",
    "3 .   find all possible superpotentials @xmath21 with coefficients taken from a particular integer set whilst removing the extra redundancy in the superpotentials .",
    "4 .   for each superpotential calculate the dimension , degree and hilbert series corresponding to the algebraic variety describing the vacuum space @xmath84 .    in these initial investigations",
    "we restrict ourselves to quiver diagrams with @xmath85 and @xmath86 for which we can obtain data using standard modern computers .",
    "routines were tested by checking the results for known quivers with small @xmath87 .",
    "we outline in further detail the algorithms involved in each of these steps .      generating all possible edge sets given @xmath67 nodes by brute force methods",
    "is computationally intensive . since we are interested in calabi - yau quivers only , we exploit the fact that the calabi - yau condition implies that the quiver is composed of edge disjoint cycles .",
    "we identify all possible combinations of cycle lengths by generating all tuples @xmath88 that satisfy @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the number of @xmath91cyclescycle , we mean a cycle of length @xmath92 . ] .    however to generate all possible graphs of some cycle combination from scratch is a non - trivial task .",
    "the fact that adding an extra cycle to a graph with @xmath93 and @xmath94 would result in a new graph with @xmath93 and @xmath95 can considerably reduce the amount of computations .",
    "that is , if we want to generate graphs with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we can build them by adding one cycle to graphs with @xmath93 and @xmath96 which we have already generated .",
    "we take @xmath97 and @xmath98 and consider the cycle combination @xmath99 as an example . a particular graph belonging to this subset",
    "is shown in figure  [ fg:6 - 8 ] .",
    "we can obtain all our desired graphs by simply adding one 2-cycle in every possible way to graphs of the combination @xmath100 which we have generated in a previous process .",
    "for example the figure  [ fg:6 - 8 ] graph can be generated by adding a 2-cycle to the graph in figure  [ fg:6 - 6 ] .",
    "however note in our example that the graph in figure  [ fg:6 - 6 ] is disconnected .",
    "when we are interested only in connected graphs , this subtlety means we must continue to reserve disconnected graphs generated in intermediate steps .",
    "[ fg:6 - 8],scaledwidth=50.0% ]     [ fg:6 - 6],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    additionally we must be careful when handling graph isomorphisms .",
    "it is well known that determining whether two graphs are isomorphic is an np problem  @xcite . with our computational resource limitations",
    "we are forced to remove redundant graphs each time we generate the full set of graphs for a given cycle combination .",
    "after that any pair of graphs within the same cycle combination are no longer isomorphic .",
    "there is additional redundancy introduced by our algorithm : some graphs can be decomposed into cycle combinations in more than one way .",
    "thus , when combining the graph sets corresponding to all relevant cycle combinations , we need to remove redundancy once again .",
    "the latter is our main obstruction to handling higher @xmath67 and @xmath83 values .",
    "considering only connected quivers reduces the redundant data generated .",
    "the vacuum data for all theories can be obtained from these connected cases as discussed in section  [ s : vac - dq ] .",
    "we note there are more efficient approaches for generating the connected quivers with toric data such as @xcite . for the purposes of this work",
    "the more general algorithm was sufficient as the calculation of the vacuum statistics rather than quivers was the limiting factor .",
    "we use the python - igraph module as a python language interface for graph manipulations .",
    "this module uses a c library called igraph  @xcite to perform underlying computations .",
    "thanks to the efficiency of the c language we are able to generate quivers with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the set of gauge invariants @xmath79 is found by generating the minimal loops ( see section [ s : pre - qd ] ) of the quiver . for each vertex",
    ", a recursive algorithm traces all possible paths beginning at the vertex until any vertex in the path is repeated ( excluding the cases when the repeated vertex is a loop ) .",
    "higher order loops are then generated by taking all possible combinations of the set of gauge invariants .",
    "superpotentials are generated from a set of terms by selecting coefficients from a coefficient set @xmath101 .",
    "first we take @xmath101 to be @xmath102 as a special case study .",
    "clearly the number of superpotential terms grows exponentially with the number of invariants .",
    "given @xmath103 gauge invariants of three or more fields , we have @xmath104 nontrivial superpotentials . for large numbers of gauge invariants",
    "we take random samples of possible superpotentials . in general a sample size s = 500 is taken unless otherwise stated .",
    "we then repeat our analysis for more general coefficients with @xmath105 , where there are now @xmath106 non - trivial superpotentials given @xmath103 invariant terms above quadratic order .      for each quiver theory",
    "generated , the calculations involving algebraic varieties were performed using the macaulay2 software  @xcite .",
    "we note that for the purposes of computation the field @xmath107 was replaced with the more manageable @xmath108 .",
    "we found that for large numbers of superpotential terms ( hence f - terms ) algorithms became difficult to run on a standard computer . fixing the number of superpotential terms is required to extend analysis to higher order theories .      as a simple example consider the case of two nodes and four edges .",
    "we have three inequivalent quivers presented in figure  [ fg : il ] . for each",
    "we generate the minimal loops .",
    "the first two diagrams have only a single cycle giving the gauge invariant @xmath109 .",
    "however including the adjoint fields in each case gives three additional invariants in the generating set .",
    "diagram ( 3 ) has a set of four operators @xmath110 which generate the invariants .",
    "the superscripts of the fields are the indices of the multi - edges .",
    "cc ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) + [ 50pt ] [ fg : il],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] +   + & [ 45pt ] [ fg : il],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    considering terms that are first order in the gauge invariants only , we obtain the superpotentials @xmath111 where @xmath112 corresponds to diagram ( @xmath113 ) and @xmath114 .",
    "we note the extra redundancy here due to the commutativity of the fields .",
    "additionally , since we take all gauge groups to be identical , the position of adjoints in the quiver is only relevant in so far as determining simple cycles the loop can be combined with .",
    "hence the invariants and vms for quivers ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are identical as the structure does not distinguish between the fields @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the vms details for the first of the pair are listed explicitly in table  [ tb:2n-4e1 ] .",
    "while the degree of the vacuum space is always one , there are 10 theories with dimension one and 16 of dimension zero .",
    ".vms data for quiver ( 1 ) of figure  [ fg : il][tb:2n-4e1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we generated the hilbert series using macaulay2 for all the quivers investigated in this paper for a more detailed catalog of vms spaces .",
    "the results are too extensive to be included within this document .",
    "instead we have provided the full information at https://github.com/dayzhou/hilbert-series[github ] by listing all possible hilbert series and their prevalence for each @xmath87 .",
    "both the basic and generic cases are available in both a readable format and as raw data .    in tables",
    "[ tb : bphs ] and [ tb : gphs ] , we present the statistical data of palindromic hilber series in percentages for both basic and generic cases .",
    "now , importantly , when the numerator of the hilbert series is palindromic , i.e. , the coefficients @xmath117 are such that @xmath118 for all @xmath113 , a theorem of stanley @xcite guarantees that the algebraic variety is calabi - yau ; this was first used in the gauge theory context in @xcite . scanning over our database of 926883 hilbert series in basic case and 270410 in generic case , we find that 879852 and 270052 in each case have this property .",
    "we conclude that _ 94.9% of our vms are calabi - yau in basic case , and 99.9% in generic case_. it is interesting to see that with increasing complexity of the theory ( increasing number of fields and gauge groups ) , the chances of it being calabi - yau seems to decrease .",
    "we can also see from our statistics that restricting the coefficients in superpotentials from @xmath119 to @xmath120 reduces the probability of being calabi - yau by about 5% .",
    "given the vast landscape of quantum field theories , especially those with @xmath0 supersymmetry whose matter content and interaction abound untameably , and given their underlying geometry in the form of the vacuum moduli space whose efficacy has ranged from phenomenology to holography , it is clearly desirable to investigate the space of such vacua . in this paper",
    ", we have initiated the study of the statistics of this space of vacuum moduli spaces , in the distribution of the dimension and degree as algebraic varieties and have explicitly computed the hilbert series for thousands of samples .",
    "we find that the representative vacuum for our study of @xmath85 and @xmath121 quivers has low dimension and degree : our distributions appear highly skewed particularly for the generic case .",
    "although increasing @xmath67 produces more interesting phenomena , the spaces of complex dimension three remain @xmath122 of the quivers for @xmath82 in our study , validating our approach as heavily selective of the vacuum landscape .",
    "our catalog of hilbert series elucidate deeper information : the chances of the vms being calabi - yau decreases as @xmath123 increases or when we we restrict the coefficient set to @xmath120 .",
    "indeed , we have only begun a clearly profitable enterprise . throughout this paper",
    "we have used abelian quiver gauge theories ( in the basic ( toric ) case and the generic case ) as a testing ground , one can extend this to more general quivers and to field theories admitting more than bifundamental and adjoints . physically , the class of such theories is by far the most studied , especially in the context of string theory and ads / cft because of the underlying toric calabi - yau geometry .",
    "mathematically , it is interesting to point out that _ every _ projective variety ( note that all our affine varieties are trivially complex cones over some projective variety ) is a quiver grassmannian @xcite .",
    "thus , from both physical and mathematical motivations , our representative class of theories is highly non - trivial .",
    "recently , there has been nice papers @xcite studying the instabilities in the landscape of high - dimensional moduli spaces .",
    "specifically , as stated in @xcite ,  tunneling rates , and hence vacuum instability , grow so rapidly with the number of moduli that the probability of a given local minimum being metastable is exponentially small \" .",
    "our statistical outlook is very much in this spirit",
    ". it would be interesting to extract such physical properties from our data .",
    "for example , our data shows that the proportion of large dimensional moduli spaces ( the real / global vacua of the theories ) in all moduli spaces is considerably small , which is consistent with the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "indeed , a programme of using vacuum geometry for the sake of particle phenomenology of the standard model and beyond has been ongoing @xcite .",
    "our geometric data should be useful toward the question of how _ geometrically generic _ the ( supersymmetric ) standard model is .",
