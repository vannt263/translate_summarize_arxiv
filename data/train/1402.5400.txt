    "the notion of a collection of containers for a hypergraph was introduced by the authors in  @xcite .",
    "a collection of containers for a hypergraph @xmath1 is a collection @xmath2 of subsets of @xmath3 such that every independent set @xmath4 is a subset of some member @xmath5 .",
    "( a subset of @xmath3 is independent if it contains no edge . )",
    "the notion was developed further in  @xcite and several applications given ; related methods and results were proved by balogh , morris and samotij  @xcite .",
    "these results have since been applied by other authors .",
    "our purpose here is to revisit the method of  @xcite , and to combine it with a twist that makes it much more widely applicable .",
    "it is true that the method of  @xcite is not too complicated , and the consequences are often best possible , but it is subtle .",
    "the method of  @xcite , on the other hand , is not optimal ; nevertheless it is very simple , and it is particularly transparent .",
    "it is sufficient , for example , for counting the number of @xmath0-free hypergraphs ( see corollary  [ cor : ffree_count ] ) , and hence it offers a very elementary and straightforward proof of this result .",
    "the method of  @xcite applies to _ simple _ or _ linear _ hypergraphs , that is , hypergraphs in which no two edges share more than one vertex .",
    "the container theorem there was as follows .",
    "we use the term _",
    "@xmath6-graph _ to mean an @xmath6-uniform hypergraph , where @xmath7 always .",
    "[ prop : curly_c ] let @xmath1 be a @xmath8-regular simple @xmath6-graph .",
    "if @xmath8 is large , there is a collection of sets @xmath9 of subsets of @xmath3 satisfying    * if @xmath10 is independent , there is some @xmath11 with @xmath12 , * @xmath13 for every @xmath14 , * @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "this proposition is not quite as stated in  @xcite , but it is pretty much explicit in the proof of theorem  1.1 that follows theorem  3.1 .",
    "two drawbacks limit the applicability of proposition  [ prop : curly_c ] .",
    "the first is that many popular container applications require containers with @xmath17)$ ] small , rather than @xmath18 small .",
    "the second is that it applies only to regular @xmath6-graphs .",
    "container results are more useful when they can be applied iteratively .",
    "that is , given an independent set @xmath4 in a hypergraph  @xmath1 , we can apply the proposition once to obtain a container @xmath19 for  @xmath4 , but we would then like to apply the proposition again , this time to the hypergraph @xmath20 $ ] ( of which @xmath4 is still an independent set ) , thus finding a smaller container @xmath21 .",
    "if possible we would then repeat this procedure until very small containers are obtained . the snag with this procedure as it stands",
    "is that it is unlikely that @xmath20 $ ] is regular even if @xmath1 is , and so iteration is not possible .",
    "of course , proposition  [ prop : curly_c ] still applies to graphs that are `` somewhat '' regular ( indeed , this follows directly from theorem  3.1 of @xcite ) , but not in a particularly strong way .",
    "both these drawbacks can be overcome by adapting the proof of theorem  3.1 in  @xcite to use the notion of _ degree measure _",
    ", which we discuss in   [ sec : degree ] .",
    "this yields a version of proposition  [ prop : curly_c ] in which @xmath19 is bounded in degree measure , namely theorem  [ thm : simplecont ] .",
    "iterated applications of this theorem give the following result , much stronger and more useful than proposition  [ prop : curly_c ] , and the main theorem of the present paper .    [ thm : sparsecont ]",
    "let @xmath1 be a simple @xmath6-graph of average degree @xmath8 .",

    "observe that theorem  [ thm : sparsecont ] differs from proposition  [ prop : curly_c ] only in that the condition of @xmath8-regularity is replaced by that of average degree  @xmath8 , and the conclusion giving a bound on @xmath18 is replaced by a bound on @xmath17)$ ] .",
    "this bound on @xmath17)$ ] implies , for regular  @xmath1 , that @xmath25 ( see the discussion in   [ sec : degree ] ) , which is essentially best possible , but is nonetheless a weaker condition than the bound on the number of edges . thus theorem",
    "[ thm : sparsecont ] is a generalization of proposition  [ prop : curly_c ] .",

    "furthermore , if @xmath1 is regular , then degree and uniform measures coincide ; in this case , the inequality @xmath34)\\le",
    "\\delta e(g)$ ] together with  ( [ eqn : mubig ] ) implies @xmath43 , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we can now state the theorem which is at the heart of the present paper .",
    "this theorem is already sufficiently powerful for obtaining non - trivial results , such as in list colouring .",
    "[ thm : simplecont ] let @xmath1 be a simple @xmath6-graph of average degree @xmath8 . if @xmath8 is large , there is a collection of sets @xmath9 of subsets of @xmath3 satisfying    * if @xmath10 is independent , there is some @xmath11 with @xmath12 , * @xmath44 for every @xmath14 , * @xmath45 where @xmath16 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : simplecont ] follows quite closely the proof of theorem  3.1 in  @xcite , but modifications are needed to accommodate the presence of both uniform and degree measures",
    ". however , nothing stronger than markov s inequality is needed .",
    "the spirit of the proof is readily explained .",
    "we need to identify a set of vertices that are not in  @xmath4 ; then @xmath19 will be the remaining vertices .",
    "we shall show that there are three small subsets @xmath46 , @xmath31 and @xmath47 of @xmath48 , such that @xmath46 , @xmath31 and @xmath47 determine such a set @xmath49 disjoint from  @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the number of different container sets @xmath19 that are so specified is at most the number of triples of small subsets @xmath50 ; this number is not large and this is where the bound on @xmath51 comes from .",
    "how , then , can we specify @xmath46 , @xmath31 and @xmath47 in such a way as to enable us to identify a set @xmath49 of vertices not in  @xmath4 ?",
    "there are no edges with all @xmath6 vertices inside  @xmath4 , but there are many edges altogether .",
    "so there must be a number @xmath52 , @xmath53 , such that there are significantly fewer edges with @xmath54 vertices in @xmath4 than there are edges with @xmath52 vertices in  @xmath4 .",
    "we might then expect to find a substantial set @xmath55 of vertices each lying in many of the latter kind of edges .",
    "so we pick small subsets @xmath56 and @xmath57 at random , and look at the set @xmath58 where @xmath59 , etc .",
    "notice that @xmath60 is determined by @xmath46 and @xmath31 .",
    "if we write @xmath61 then clearly @xmath62 is a container for @xmath4 that is specified by @xmath50 .",
    "now @xmath46 and @xmath31 are small by definition , and we expect @xmath47 also to be small , because there are few edges with @xmath54 vertices in  @xmath4 . on the other hand , vertices of @xmath63 have a good chance of lying inside @xmath60 , so we expect @xmath60 to contain much of @xmath63 and so have substantial measure , meaning that @xmath64 is bounded away from one .",
    "this is the heart of the proof .",
    "let @xmath65 be the vertex set of @xmath1 of size @xmath66 and @xmath67 the edge set . for sets @xmath68 and @xmath69 , let @xmath60 be as defined above .",
    "given subsets @xmath70 , let @xmath71 note that @xmath72 by definition .",
    "we will show that for every independent set @xmath4 , there are small subsets @xmath73 such that @xmath74 .",
    "specifically , let @xmath75 note that @xmath76 is small if @xmath8 is large ( depending on @xmath6 ) .",
    "we now define the collection @xmath2 by @xmath77 for @xmath8 sufficiently large , where @xmath16 .",
    "this collection @xmath9 will satisfy the conditions of the lemma .",
    "fix an independent set @xmath4 .",

    "statement @xmath86 is false , because @xmath4 is independent and so @xmath87 .",
    "there must therefore exist @xmath88 such that @xmath82 is true and @xmath89 is false . fix a set @xmath90 witnessing the falsity of @xmath89 ; thus @xmath79 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "for @xmath93 , let @xmath94 let @xmath95 . note that @xmath96 .",
    "consider an edge @xmath97 with @xmath98 . then @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "since @xmath101 we can pick @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "now @xmath104 so , by definition of @xmath105 , we have @xmath106 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath103 , the definition of @xmath63 and the fact that @xmath107 imply @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the total number of edges in @xmath109 but not in @xmath110 is less than @xmath111 . by the choice of @xmath90 as witness set , we know that @xmath92 and so @xmath112 . since @xmath82 is true , this means @xmath113 . but @xmath91 and therefore @xmath114 .",
    "let @xmath115 , so @xmath116 .",
    "since @xmath117 , we observe that @xmath118 let @xmath119 and @xmath120 be random sets where each vertex ( of @xmath4 and @xmath121 respectively ) is included independently with probability @xmath122 . by markov s inequality , the inequalities @xmath123 and @xmath124 each hold with probability at least @xmath125 .",
    "let @xmath126 .",
    "then clearly , @xmath127 provided @xmath128 .",
    "so to complete the proof , it is enough to show that the inequalities @xmath129 and @xmath128 each hold with probability at least  @xmath125 , because then , with positive probability , all four inequalities @xmath130 and @xmath131 will hold .    a vertex @xmath132 will be included in @xmath60 ( i.e. , in @xmath47 ) if it lies in an edge @xmath133 with @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "therefore @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which means @xmath139 .",
    "we know @xmath92 .",
    "for an edge @xmath140 with @xmath138 , there are @xmath54 partitions of @xmath133 of the form @xmath141 with @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 . for each such partition , the probability that both @xmath135 and @xmath145 is @xmath146 .",
    "so the expected size of @xmath47 is at most @xmath147 applying markov s inequality again implies that @xmath148 with probability at least @xmath125 .",
    "recall that @xmath149 by definition of @xmath63 , and so in particular @xmath150 .",
    "let @xmath151 .",
    "then @xmath152 , and so @xmath153 .",

    "then @xmath155 ( since @xmath156 is small ) .",

    "the probability that @xmath161 and @xmath162 is @xmath146 and , because @xmath1 is simple , these events over all  @xmath106 are independent .",
    "hence the probability that @xmath163 , that is , @xmath164 , is at most @xmath165 now @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the indicator of the event @xmath163 . taking expectations , @xmath168 , since @xmath169 .",
    "markov s inequality implies that , with probability at least  @xmath125 , @xmath170 holds , and hence @xmath171 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we remark that the proof shows the theorem to be true for a smaller value of  @xmath172 , namely @xmath173 for some function @xmath174 of  @xmath6 , but the results of  @xcite are better still , with @xmath175 , so we keep the present value for simplicity .",
    "one might wonder why the bound here on @xmath176 is worse than the bound in  @xcite .",
    "it is not because of the random choice of @xmath46 and  @xmath31 , because in the context of the present algorithm random choice is quite efficient , and a deterministic choice is unlikely to be much better .",
    "the reason that the present method is relatively inefficient is that it uses edges with exactly @xmath52 vertices in  @xmath4 for one value of @xmath52 only , and ignores all other edges .",
    "the methods of  @xcite and  @xcite , which are unrelated to the present method , are not lengthy to describe but are nonetheless crafted carefully to use all edges and to be as efficient as possible .",
    "applying theorem  [ thm : simplecont ] repeatedly , as described earlier , we obtain the main theorem .    as we remarked earlier ,",
    "let us apply theorem  [ thm : simplecont ] to @xmath1 itself , and then again to each container so obtained , then to each of the new containers , and so on for each container with at least @xmath177 edges , until we obtain a collection @xmath2 of containers @xmath19 with @xmath17 ) < \\delta e(g)$ ] . since , by  ( [ eqn : musmall ] ) , each application of theorem  [ thm : simplecont ] decreases the fraction of edges by @xmath178 , @xmath2 is obtained after at most @xmath179 levels of iteration , and so @xmath180 , where @xmath172 is the maximum over all applications of theorem  [ thm : simplecont ] .",

    "as remarked earlier , for regular hypergraphs , the condition @xmath17 ) < \\delta e(g)$ ] implies @xmath183 . plugging this value into theorem  2.1 of  @xcite",
    "immediately improves by a factor of two the bound on the list colouring number in theorem  1.1 of  @xcite ; nevertheless the bound obtained remains a factor of two worse than the bound in theorem  1.3 of  @xcite , which is probably best possible .",
    "we now give an application of theorem  [ thm : sparsecont ] in a situation where the hypergraph of interest is not simple . in what follows , @xmath0 is a fixed @xmath184-graph .",
