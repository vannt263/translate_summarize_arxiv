    "( 1993 ) , events due to _ unresolved _ stars essentially escape detection of these analyses .",
    "such stars , beyond the crowding limit or too dim to resolve , could significantly contribute to the number of detectable events .",
    "this is illustrated by the detection of two variable objects in the macho analysis ( alcock et al .",
    "1997a ) of data , which could not be resolved at their minimum luminosity .",
    "the detection of the variation was nevertheless possible because the reference images used to establish the catalogue of monitored stars were taken during their maximum luminosity , when the stars were resolved .",
    "however , such events can neither be kept for further considerations nor be included in the computation of detection efficiencies , in the star monitoring approach .    in this paper",
    ", we apply a pixel analysis to the eros  91 - 92 data ( 10% of the whole eros-1 ccd data set ) of the .",
    "the idea is to monitor the flux of all the pixels present on the images , thus achieving a good sensitivity to the whole stellar content of the images .",
    "the magnification of one unresolved star can be detected as a variation of the pixel flux , provided that the magnification is high enough .",
    " in the following , we will refer to this approach as pixel monitoring , as opposed to star monitoring referring to classical analyses restricted to resolved stars .",
    " the main uncertainties of this approach concern our ability to account properly for variations of the observational conditions , and to be able to disentangle intrinsic variations from observational systematics . in paper  i",

    "this homogeneous set of super - pixel light curves is called agaperos : each of these light curves covers a period of @xmath7 days and is composed of about 90 measurements . with this rather short period of observation",
    ", we show here how it is possible to investigate the macho mass range of interest ( @xmath8 ) with the existing eros-1 ccd data set , initially designed for short time scale events in a mass range ( @xmath9 ) where no event has been detected .",
    "we first present the simple formalism used to describe the pixel events in which we are interested . the pixel flux @xmath10 , affected by a microlensing event ,",
    "can be written as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the measurement number , @xmath13 is the time , @xmath14 is the seeing fraction , @xmath15 the magnification , @xmath16 the flux of the star of interest at rest ( i.e. , unmagnified ) , and @xmath17 includes the sky and stellar backgrounds .",
    "the magnification ( paczyski 1986 ) depends on the normalized impact parameter @xmath18 : @xmath19 with @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the macho transverse velocity , @xmath22 and @xmath23 the impact parameter and time of closest approach , and @xmath24 the einstein radius : @xmath25 the typical time scale of the variation is the einstein radius crossing time : @xmath26    in paper  i , we showed that the variations of the observational conditions , which obviously affect eq .",
    "[ eq : phi ] , can be corrected : each image is first geometrically aligned with the reference image .",
    "then sky background and absorption factor are corrected to the values of the reference image .",
    "finally , each super - pixel flux is adjusted to take account of the seeing variation , affecting @xmath27 .",
    "since the mean seeing is about @xmath28 arc - second , we estimate @xmath14 to be on average @xmath29 for the corrected @xmath30 super - pixel light curves , obtained in paper  i. we showed that in the absence of microlensing events ( @xmath31 ) , we achieve a proper understanding of the errors affecting these light curves , and that eq .",
    "[ eq : phi ] describes to a good approximation the light curves we are studying .    the usual requirements used for the selection of microlensing events detected by star monitoring can be applied here :    * as the microlensing phenomenon is a transient and rare phenomenon , it should produce a _ unique _ significant variation in the star flux .",

    "note that on the one hand , the details of this latter extrapolation are not important because , as we show below , few events are detectable for sources fainter than @xmath43 ; but on the other hand , the connection between these 3 sets of observations is a source of uncertainties .",

    "( 1993 ) , we account for possible finite source effects that are expected when the stellar radius projected onto the plane of the macho is comparable with the einstein radius .",
    "we are then able to compute the number of expected events using well - known monte - carlo integration techniques .",
    "we require here some minimal requirements that will define a set of simulated microlensing events that could be detected with an ideal experiment .",
    "as we do not expect to detect a significant number of low - magnification events , we introduce a threshold @xmath45 in our simulations .",
    "detectable low - magnification events affect bright stars and hence would have already been detected by the previous eros star monitoring analysis anyway .",
    "moreover , the magnification by such a small factor of a dim star would be completely buried into the noise , therefore one must add a visibility condition . we choose the following : _ at the time of maximum magnification _ , the flux of the central super - pixel of a magnified star should rise higher than @xmath46 above the background , @xmath47 being taken as twice the photon noise .",
    "it is important to note that this threshold does not depend on the duration of the event .",

    "[ eq : phi ] must also be considered ( see wozniak & paczyski  1997 , alcock et al.1996 ) to account for the magnification of underlying stars .",

    "[ fig : para1 ] ) .",
    "however , the identification of the star that has varied is one possible practical problem which must be studied further , but could probably be overcome . for the dimmest stars , unambiguous determination of the stellar flux will most probably require an hst measurement of the star flux during the event .",

    "we have shown with the computation of detection efficiencies that the gain in detectable microlensing events with pixel monitoring is significant : _ pixel monitoring can detect @xmath167 times more microlensing events than star monitoring _ for very crowded lmc bar fields .    with simple selection criteria we have been able to show that no microlensing events are present in this data set .",
    "the criteria imposed mainly rely on the uniqueness of the variation , on the achromaticity and on the fact that the microlensing phenomenon  a geometrical effect  should affect all kind of stars independently of their type .",
