    "the general theory of relativity conveyed an understanding of phenomena such as the distortion of time - space by a gravitational or acceleration field@xcite .",
    "however , the manner in which the curvature of space - time , that is the riemannian space , affects the electronic properties of condensed matters systems on a microscopic scale is largely unknown and due to its experimental accessibility of great interest@xcite .",
    "riemannian geometric effects in a quantum system , which can either be free or constrained , stem from the dependance of the kinetic term on the metric of the embedding space or the metric of the sub - manifold onto which the quantum system is constrained by a confining potential ( rigid chemical bond ; electrostatic attraction ) .",
    "the problem of constraining particle motion to a curved sub - manifold embedded in a euclidean space @xmath0 can be resolved in one of two alternative ways : i. ) in the _ intrinsic _ quantization approach , the motion is constrained to the curved sub - manifold in the first place .",
    "a hamiltonian is constructed from generalized coordinates and momenta intrinsic to the sub - manifold and the system is quantized canonically . as a result ,",
    "the embedding space is inaccessible and the quantum system depends only on the geometry intrinsic to the sub - manifold / hyper - plane@xcite ; ii . ) in the _ confining _ potential approach , a free in the embedding space quantum particle is subjected by a normal to the sub - manifold force that in effect confines the dynamics onto it .",
    "the effective hamiltonian depends on the intrinsic geometry and on the way this sub - manifold is immersed in the embedding space .    on one hand ,",
    "the intrinsic quantization procedure is plagued with ordering ambiguities that allow for multiple consistent quantization procedures different by a term proportional to the curvature of the sub - manifold .",
    "on the other hand , the confining potential procedure leads to a unique effective hamiltonian that depends on the constraint . in real microscopic quantum systems ,",
    "constrained motion is a result of a strong confining force ( electrostatic ; rigid chemical bonds , ect . ) .",
    "therefore , confining potential formalism seems a physically more realistic approach to constraints .",
    "the non - relativistic quantum mechanics in a three dimensional hyper - plane of the four dimensional curved space - time can be treated in a well established manner@xcite . in this case",
    "the embedding space - time is non - euclidean but equipped with a metric . this four - dimensional metric is related to the matter distribution by the einstein equation .",
    "suppose the four dimensional space - time @xmath1 is topologically the product @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents a space - like three dimensional hyper - plane .",
    "we can then foliate @xmath1 by a one parameter family of imbeddings given by the map @xmath4 @xmath5 such that @xmath6 that is @xmath7 is the image of the map @xmath8 in @xmath1 for a fixed  time  @xmath9 we assume that the leaves @xmath7 are space - like with respect to the metric in @xmath10 as a result , there exists in @xmath1 a time - like field normal to the leaves @xmath11 therefore there is a notion of future and past .",
    "this time evolution vector field @xmath12 satisfies @xmath13 so that local coordinates @xmath14 ( satisfying @xmath15 for @xmath16 ) can be introduced . in effect , the space - time is splittable into 3 + 1 dimensions and the induced riemannian metric @xmath17 onto the three dimensional @xmath7 can be used to write the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath18 , which is the kinetic energy term in the schrdinger equation for the subjected to the geometric field quantum particle or quantum condensate @xmath19    the emergence of the geometric field from the kinetic term can be made clearer in the vicinity of the origin where the following taylor expansion of the induced metric in normal coordinates applies : @xmath20 @xcite and expanding the square root of the determinant of the metric yields : @xmath21 using a standard re - normalisation of the wave - function @xmath22 and keeping the lowest order terms ( the only relevant for the quantum dynamics ) in the taylor expansion we get for the kinetic term in the schrdinger equation @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the laplacian on flat space . adding an additional potential @xmath25 that may act in the system we convey the complete symbolic equation with which we will further work with @xmath26 here @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the three - dimensional ricci scalar curvature and @xmath29 is a numeric coefficient .",
    "the emergence of a geometric potential from the kinetic term is obvious .",
    "such a term is a standard coupling term between curvature and a quantum field in quantum field theory in curved space - time .",
    "note , the particular form of the geometric potential may vary and in the case of a constraining potential approach takes the expressions : i. ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the principle curvature of a space curve embedded in @xmath32 ; ii . )",

    "suppose , that we deal with a cooper pair condensate inside a superconductor .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the cooper pair will be the above equation ( [ schrodinger&r ] ) with @xmath42 that is twice the charge of the electron .",
    "this equation will describe the state of the entire condensate .",
    "therefore , we may write @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the the charge density of the condensate and @xmath45 its phase . upon substitution of this form of the wave - function into ( [ schrodinger&r ] )",
    "we can separate the real and imaginary part of the equation to arrive at slightly modified standard result : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the current density , which in the case of a superconducting condensate stands also for the probability current .",
    "the generalised momentum is contained in the expression for@xmath48 @xmath49 therefore the current density is just the velocity of the superconducting current times the charge density .    taking the gradient of the whole equation ( [ eq : theta_t ] ) and expressing @xmath50 from ( [ eq : rho_t ] ) ( akin to @xcite )",
    "we obtain the modified version of the hydrodynamic interpretation of the quantum condensate dynamics : @xmath51,\\\\ \\nabla \\times \\vec{v}=-\\frac{q}{m}\\vec{b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the lorentz force acting on the charged cooper pairs .",
    "these two equations are the equations of motion of the superconducting cooper pair fluid in the presence of an induced from the embedding space - time curvature , which in this paper ofter refer to geometric field .",
    "note , the geometric field enters the gradient of the mystical quantum mechanical potential , recognised by bohm as a unique interaction with the @xmath53field itself@xcite . as a result ,",
    "the geometric field and the @xmath53field ( in view of bohmian quantum mechanics ) have similar and competing action .",
    "next we recall the london equations for the quantum superconducting current density@xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( see eq.(21.20 ) in @xcite ) for brevity we will call the introduced quantity @xmath56 which can be either of scalar or tensorial character , the polarisation operator . a correct microscopic theory of superconductivity can produce an expression for it in therms of the energy gap and critical temperature@xcite .",
    "next , we divide both sides of ( [ eq : london ] ) by the current density @xmath57 and then differentiate with respect to time @xmath58 only to equate the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : dv / dt ] ) with the r.h.s of ( [ eq : london / rho ] ) @xmath59=\\frac{d } { d t } m \\frac{\\hat{\\pi } \\vec{a}}{\\rho}.\\ ] ]",
    "in the case when the superconducting state is robust , we may assume that @xmath60 the current density in the superconductor is approximately constant as well as the polarisation operator ( no internal changes in the microscopic mechanism ) .",
    "the ideal diamagnetism of the superconducting state reduces the lorentz force to its electrostatic part , which is non - vanishing only in the case when a josephson junction is present ( two separated conducting domains at different electrostatic potentials ) . finally , the above simplifications yield @xmath61= - q\\vec{e } +   m \\frac{\\hat{\\pi } } { \\rho } \\frac{d \\vec{a}}{d t}.\\ ] ] which is simply an expression for the conservation of energy .",
    "let us take a line integral of the above along an open path from point a to point b @xmath62 next we introduce the geometric field energy @xmath63 next recall that @xmath64 that is @xmath65 is the electromotive potential difference between the two points and @xmath66 finally ( [ eq : nabla_r_2 ] ) can be re - written using ( [ eq : rho_t ] ) as @xmath67 \\\\ \\nonumber & & -\\frac{m}{q}\\frac{\\hat{\\pi } } { \\rho } \\left [ \\mathcal{e}_{ind}(b ) - \\mathcal{e}_{ind}(a ) \\right]+",

    "d\\vec{l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , suppose the copper pair charge velocity is constant at the two adjacent points , than the last integral quantity measures the difference in the interaction energy @xmath68 between the cooper pairs and the vector potential at the two points : @xmath69 introducing the electrostatic energy @xmath70 we can put ( [ eq : nabla_r_2 ] ) in its final form @xmath71 \\\\    & & \\qquad = w_g(a ) - w_{stat}(a ) + \\frac{m}{q}\\frac{\\hat{\\pi } } { \\rho } \\left [   \\mathcal{e}_{ind}(a ) -   w_{int}(a )    \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a result of introducing the scalar polarisation operator from ( [ eq : london ] ) and @xcite , the following conserved quantity at each material point of the superconductor emerges : @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the electrical energy of the cooper pairs .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the geometric field is equivalent to an electric field in the superconductor ( [ eq : nabla_r ] ) which statement is analogous to the law of conservation of energy ( [ eq : conservation ] ) .",
    "therefore , provided the superconducting element is homogeneous , we can expect @xmath74 and as a result of the perfect conductor aspect of the superconducting state , we can also expect a redistribution of the shifted by the geometric field charges inside the superconductor in order to maintain the superconductor at a constant potential",
    ".    a completely different behaviour can be expected at the josephson junction .",
    "we will discuss two cases of the junction , one between superconducting sides made from the same superconductor ( symmetric ) and one between two different superconductors ( asymmetric ) .",
    "clearly , in the symmetric junction , the interaction energy @xmath75 will be the same on both sides .",
    "however the electrostatic potential on the two sides can be different and the voltage drop @xmath39 can be equated to the geometric potential , that is the curvature scalar r itself . in effect , the difference in the geometric field between the two sides @xmath76 can produce a voltage drop at the junction ( direct effect ) or the voltage drop across the junction can produce curvature difference ( reversed effect ) : @xmath77 in this case , we may regard the josephson junction as a curvature - to - voltage converter with the following ratio ( @xmath78 is the free electron mass ) : @xmath79 \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{20 }   [ { \\rm m}^{-2}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note , the only difference the asymmetric junction can introduce is the difference in the interaction energy @xmath68 between the supercurrent and the electromagnetic field at the two sides of the junction .",
    "suppose the supercurrent flows in the junction at vanishing potential difference @xmath80 , then the interaction energy gradient can produce rippling in the geometric field according to : @xmath81 the interaction energy ( [ eq : interaction ] ) is a function of the supercurrent drift velocity and one may view the asymmetric effect as produced by a sharp change in momentum , which converts into rippling of the geometric field .",
    "we may expect a back - reaction on the entire junction as well .",
    "the kinetic energy of the bulk material can certainly be included in ( [ eq : conservation ] ) .",
    "the back reaction will increase with the increase in the difference between the interaction energy of the supercurrent with the electromagnetic field on both sides .",
    "an argument that the josephson junction can act as a reversible curvature - to - voltage converter was presented in the previous section . in effect , the argument is prone to experimental testing and now we will discuss how and to what extent .",
    "note , the conversion factor ( [ eq : conservation ] ) points to the impossibility to observe the travelling ripples in space - time , that is gravitational waves , with a josephson junction . along the span of the junction ( few angstrom [ @xmath82 )",
    "the expected difference in the induced scalar curvature is very small @xmath83[m@xmath84 , therefore according to ( [ eq : conservation ] ) we may not hope for potential difference greater than @xmath85[v ] which is unmeasurable .",
    "we are in a position to answer the questions from the introduction .",
    "we are unable to measure the geometric field at the josephson junction .",
    "however , since we expect that the effect is reversible , we may attempt to create a geometric field at the junction by an electric discharge between its sides . the greater the potential difference that can be created between the sides , the greater the geometric field that could be created .",
    "we are unaware of the dynamics of the created geometric field and do not have any governing equations at the present stage of discussion on its propagation .",
    "nevertheless , we can propose two detection methods which in theory can confirm the proposed effect .",
    "the first approach stems from the reversibility argument .",
    "suppose we have two junctions in close proximity .",
    "we have no firm reason to choose a particular set - up , but choose to discuss the idea of the experiment with the two junctions placed along a line in such a way that the plane of the junctions ( the insulating layer ) is normal to the imaginary line connecting them .",
    "both junctions should be magnetically and electrically shielded from each other and the surrounding environment",
    ". one of them will serve as an emitter and the other as detector .",
    "a high - voltage discharge should be conducted in the emitter and an induced voltage drop should be recorded at the detector .",
    "provided such an electric potential difference is recorded via proper coincidence scheme ( an additional detector junction involved ) , we may confirm that the geometric effect at the josephson junction is a physical reality .",
    "the second approach involves the ability of the geometric field to impart motion to objects with inertia .",
    "the geometric field while a measure of the curvature of space - time is an acceleration field as well , or better induces force ( in the lab frame ) on a free object of inertia via the newton s second law @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the imparted acceleration .",
    "we can give a rough estimate of the imparted acceleration in order to come up with an experimental procedure to verify the effect .",
    "there are two possibilities to arrive at an estimate .",
    "the first approach involves the use of the gauss s law for gravitation @xmath88 and the @xmath89 component of einstein s field equations for a perfect fluid ( where @xmath90 ) : @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the velocity of light in vacuum , @xmath93 is newton s gravitation constant and @xmath94 is the matter density .",
    "next we make use of an exact result valid for a 3 + 1 decomposition of space - time:@xmath95 where @xmath28 is the scalar ricci curvature of the three - dimensional hyper - surface@xcite . combining these relations we end up with @xmath96 that is equivalent to @xmath97 in the case when the imparted acceleration is in one dimension along the span of @xmath98 interestingly",
    ", a similar result is obtained if one takes up the geodesic deviation equation @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the 4-velocity of an object travelling along the geodesic and @xmath101 is the deviation vector .",
    "note , the riemann tensor enters the relation directly .",
    "the geodesic deviation measures the acceleration with which two neighbouring geodesics deviate from each other in the curved geometry .",
    "suppose @xmath100 is a unit vector in the time direction and @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a constant , then the geodesic deviation equation in one dimension is approximately @xmath104 upon a substitution of the riemann tensor component with the ricci scalar curvature .",
    "most importantly , the two expressions agree in the order of magnitude and the expected acceleration a geometric field pulse with a magnitude of @xmath105 $ ] and a width of the size of the josephson junction @xmath106 $ ] can impart on an object along its path is enormous @xmath107 the dislocation such a pulse can cause is proportional to the time of its duration squared .",
    "however , we have no estimate of this quantity , but given the large value for the acceleration even a femtosecond pulse can lead to substantial dislocation of the order of meters .",
    "we also have no estimate of the spread with distance of this geometric field pulse and believe the assumed value for the scalar curvature and imparted to a material body acceleration to be largely exaggerated .",
    "now suppose we conduct a high - voltage discharge in a josephson junction and try to measure the dislocation of a mirror , mechanically shielded from the junction .",
    "such a dislocation will be induced by the emitted at the junction geometric field .",
    "the position of the mirror with respect to the junction is unknown , therefore few geometric set - ups should be tried .",
    "next , in order to increase the sensitivity of the experiment , we suggest the inclusion of the detection mirror as a primary or secondary mirror in a michelson interferometer . provided a dislocation in the mirror",
    "is recorded we may confirm the generation of a geometric field in a josephson junction .",
    "in conclusion we would like to point out the origin of the geometric potential from the kinetic term of a constrained to a curved three - dimensional hyper - plane of space - time quantum mechanical condensate ( superconductor ) .",
    "this potential makes its way into the hydrodynamic interpretation of the schrdinger equation and enters it on an equal footing with the bohm s `` quantum potential . ''",
    "when external electromagnetic field is included in the dynamics and a suitable simplifications applied , one is able to derive an obvious energy conservation relation at every material point in the superconductor .",
    "this conservation relation includes a geometric field part associated with the curvature of the hyper - plane .",
    "it turns out that at a tunnelling junction ( josephson junction ) the energy conservation relation implies the possibility to transform electric energy into geometric energy , that is create curvature in the hyper - plane and vice versa . in effect , it turns out that the josephson junction can act as a voltage - to - curvature converter .",
    "experimental procedures are discussed in hope the present study invites experimental effort to verify the effect .",
    "77                    in fact , riemann used the expansion of a metric in normal coordinates to originally define the curvature tensor . in normal coordinates there is no necessity to distinguish between co- and contra- variant indices .",
