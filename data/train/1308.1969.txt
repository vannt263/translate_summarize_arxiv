    "there have been extensive studies on vortex ordering and pinning for superconductors with periodic arrays of pinning sites where the arrays have square or triangular order . in these systems the critical current or the force needed to depin the vortices passes through maxima due to commensuration effects that occur when the number of vortices is an integer multiple of the number of pinning sites @xcite .",

    "there are strong commensurability effects at both integer and noninteger matching fields , where the noninteger matchings correspond to integer matchings of the original undiluted triangular array .",

    "all of the pinning sites are occupied and an ordered crystalline arrangement of vortices occurs . by directly counting the number of vortices per pinning site in the ordered part of the sample , we confirm that these are the @xmath141 and @xmath136 fillings .",
    "for the @xmath7 array , figure [ fig:12](b ) shows a peak in @xmath56 for @xmath137 corresponding to the ordered vortex array illustrated in the inset .",
    "we have investigated ordering and pinning of vortices interacting with archimedean pinning arrays .",
    "the arrays are constructed using the vertices of archimedean tilings of squares and triangles , and we specifically examine the elongated triangular tiling and the snub square tiling . for the elongated triangular or @xmath6 array , we find that beyond the first matching field , the interstitial vortices first fill the square plaquettes and subsequently fill the triangular plaquettes , producing pronounced peaks in the magnetization at noninteger matching fields along with an absence of peaks at certain higher integer matching fields .",
    "the competition between filling the more confined triangular plaquettes with single vortices or doubly occupying the larger square plaquettes can lead to a decrease in the fraction of occupied pins as the field is increased , and can produce disordered vortex states at certain integer matching fields .",
    "we also find novel vortex orderings at submatching fillings , such as herringbone configurations for weak pinning .",
    "for the snub square or @xmath7 array above the first matching field , we find that by analyzing the plaquette fillings we can correctly predict the appearance of a sequence of partially ordered states , where interstitial vortices first occupy square plaquettes and then fill the triangular plaquettes . at higher fields we observe additional commensuration effects at noninteger matching fields which correspond to ordered vortex structures .",
    "our results can be tested for experiments on archimedean tilling pinning arrays in superconductors as well as for colloids interacting with optical trap arrays with similar geometries .",
