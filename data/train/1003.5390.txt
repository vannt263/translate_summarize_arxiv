    "in cryptography and broader applications , such as the general factorization of integers , it is often of interest to determine quickly if an integer @xmath3 is a true square or is a product of two closely spaced integers , such as twin primes",
    ". numerous non - deterministic methods of varying efficiencies are currently applied to the problem of finding the square root of an integer .",
    "these methods include digit - by - digit calculations , taylor series , newton s method _ ref [ 1 ] _ , pell s equation _ ref [ 2 ] _ , and even sophisticated hardware implementations _ ref [ 3]_. for very large integers , these methods , may not yield rapid conclusive results .",
    "in contrast , the algorithm presented here provides a conclusive answer after a specific number of steps , determined by the size of the @xmath3 . throughout this presentation ,",
    "all variables and computations are based on positive integer arithmetic alone .",
    "the number of required iterations to find the square root of @xmath3 is approximately @xmath7 . the same number of iterations is required to certify that @xmath3 is a non - square .",
    "suppose the object is to find the square root of a general integer @xmath8 .",
    "the presented algorithm works by focusing on @xmath3 , the odd factor of @xmath8 that is not divisible by 2 or 3 to any power .",
    "@xmath9    clearly , if either @xmath10 or @xmath11 is odd , @xmath8 is not a perfect square .",
    "if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are both even , then @xmath8 is square if @xmath3 is square . since factors of @xmath12 and @xmath0 can quickly be identified in even large numbers , we can choose a representation for @xmath3 which do not contain these divisors .",
    "one such representation is the reduced residue system @xmath13 with the elements + @xmath14 or @xmath15 modulo @xmath16 , where each element @xmath17 $ ] is a residue class in @xmath13 . by definition ,",
    "@xmath18 $ ] , all @xmath17 $ ] are relatively prime to @xmath16 from which it follows that g.c.d . @xmath19 and the congruence @xmath20 has a solution",
    ". it also happens to be true that all @xmath17 $ ] in @xmath13 are relatively prime to each other , which is not generally true for reduced residue systems ; but is true , for example , for systems modulo @xmath0 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath16 .",
    "since the integer @xmath16 only contains the divisors @xmath12 and @xmath0 , @xmath13 contains no even numbers and no odd numbers divisible by @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 is an ideal representation of all possible @xmath3-values because every @xmath3 defined in equation 1 can be @xmath24 assigned to one of the six elements \\{1 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17}. according to euler s theorem , for @xmath25 relatively prime to @xmath16 , @xmath26 .",
    "see figure 1 .    to test for divisibility by 3 one",
    "traditionally computes the sum - of - digits ( sod ) of @xmath3 repeatedly until a number between one and nine results , often called the digit root ( dr ) .",
    "if dr is 3 , 6 , or 9 then @xmath3 is divisible by three .",
    "this test is equivalent to computing @xmath27 where the latter calculation involves division by 9 as opposed to summation of digits .    here ,",
    "we extend this test to cover @xmath28 replacing division by @xmath16 with the addition of the digits in @xmath3 .",
    "we will show that a mapping exists between the elements in @xmath13 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , of the form :    @xmath31(mod9 ) = n(mod9)\\ ] ]    @xmath32 + for @xmath33 write n(mod18 ) as @xmath34 and for @xmath35 write n(mod9 ) as @xmath36 .",
    "it follows that @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the equality in equation 2 is satisfied when : @xmath39    this condition is uniquely met for all @xmath3 in @xmath13 ; and therefore the dr method can be applied to the elements in @xmath13 as long as it is recognized that we have to use c = 11 for d = 2 , c = 13 for d = 4 , and c = 17 for d = 8 . for 1 , 5 , 7 : c = d. to find which element an arbitrary @xmath3 belongs to , we apply the condition in equation 3 . by doing so",
    ", we have substituted division by @xmath16 with addition .",
    "for example ,",
    "if @xmath40 , sod(n ) = 29 with dr(29 ) = 2 , then n belongs to element @xmath41 , written as @xmath42 $ ] or 11 + 18x .",
    "writing any integer in @xmath13 as @xmath43 , with @xmath2 is uniquely determined by dr(n ) , any square in @xmath13 can be written as : @xmath44    from this expression @xmath29 equals @xmath45 because the remaining terms contain the factor @xmath16 , which does not affect the @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath2 is limited to the values 1 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , the squares in @xmath13 are therefore found only in : @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "this simplification comes with a computational cost for squares because two @xmath2-values are possible for each element :    * @xmath47 $ ] for a = 1 , 17 * @xmath48 $ ] for a = 5 , 13 * @xmath49 $ ] for a = 7 , 11    therefore , two parallel tests are needed for each square root calculation .",
    "[ fig : in1 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "since @xmath13 contains all odd primes , except 3 , all twin primes are members of @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , since the difference between two twin primes is @xmath12 , twin primes can only occur between the residue classes [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] ( type a ) ; [ 11 ] , [ 13 ] ( type b ) ; and [ 17 ] , [ 1 ] ( type c ) .",
    "the first 12 twin prime sets and their types are given in figure 8 .",
    "because the product between twin primes always belongs to @xmath50 $ ] and squares always belong to @xmath47 , [ 7 ] , [ 13]$ ] ; the @xmath2 , and therefore dr(n ) , in @xmath51 becomes a convenient differentiator between the two cases .",
