    "the near - infrared ( nir ) emission of galaxies , corresponding to @xmath4 , is becoming increasingly accessible with future facilities such as the _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) .",
    "however , the nir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies at @xmath1 is still poorly understood . at rest - frame wavelengths @xmath5 the sed",
    "is dominated by stellar emission , while at wavelengths @xmath6 it is dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) and warm dust emission ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is the intermediate wavelength regime that has contributions from stellar emission , but possibly also other components .",

    "@xcite found a systematic nir excess with respect to the stellar emission in a sample of @xmath8 galaxies at @xmath1 in the gemini deep deep survey .",
    "the results suggested that this emission is directly linked to the formation of stars , possibly originating from hot dust in circumstellar disks .",
    "this hypothesis was further corroborated by a study of @xmath9 nearby spatially resolved galaxies in the sings survey @xcite .    given that the amount of star formation @xcite as well as the nir excess in galaxies in general @xcite increases when going to higher redshifts , it becomes evident that modeling the properties of high - redshift galaxies requires a better understanding of their nir emission .",
    "in this paper , we aim to take a further step toward understanding nir emission in high - redshift galaxies through a multi - wavelength study in the goods fields , which offer deep ground- and space - based coverage , including _",
    "herschel _ and _ chandra _ observations .",
    "we construct samples of galaxies with strong nir excess emission and those lacking a detectable excess component , and we study their systematic differences . in the following ,",
    "we assume a @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "we use the photometric catalogs from the 3d-_hst _ survey @xcite , as described in @xcite .",

    "* ) with publicly available data sets , including _ spitzer_/irac data at @xmath14 .",
    "the irac photometry is of special interest to us since its four bands cover the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath15 at @xmath1 .",
    "source flux densities were obtained inside a @xmath16 diameter aperture due to the large point - spread function at wavelengths detected by the irac instrument . as described in detail in @xcite , using the mophongo code @xcite , high - resolution f125w , f140w , and f160w images were used as a prior in the source extraction to estimate contributions from blended sources . to additionally avoid blending we excluded galaxies that have a neighboring source within @xmath17 or a source with a @xmath18 times higher @xmath19 flux density within @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath20 _ mips _ photometry was presented in @xcite .",
    "we use the same catalogs where the bolometric ir luminosity at @xmath21 , @xmath22 , is derived from a luminosity independent conversion of the @xmath20 flux density .",

    ".    we also cross - match our photometric catalogs with the publicly available goods herschel catalog @xcite by requiring one source in the 3d - hst catalog to be within @xmath26 .",
    "g141 grism spectra were obtained as part of the 3d-_hst _ survey and cover @xmath27 .",
    "we use the 3d-_hst _ v4.1.5 data release @xcite .",
    "a modified version of eazy @xcite was used to simultaneously fit photometric and grism data and obtain grism redshifts . for the small fraction of objects lacking spectroscopic redshifts or grism exposure we use photometric redshifts as described in @xcite and @xcite ; see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the photometric redshift accuracy .",
    "stellar masses were obtained from the @xmath28 photometry using fast @xcite with a @xcite imf and the @xcite attenuation law .",
    "note that the nir sed is down - weighted when fitting for redshifts and stellar parameters by assigning large systematic errors @xcite .",
    "therefore , an nir excess should not significantly bias these properties .",
    "chandra deep - field south ( cdf - s ) and chandra deep - field north (",
    "cdf - n ) cover the goods candels fields and are the deepest _ chandra _ surveys available .",
    "we use the chandra 4ms @xcite and chandra 2ms source catalogs @xcite for sources individually detectable in x - rays . for individually undetected sources in goods - s",
    "we use a stacking analysis @xcite on the exposure and count maps presented in @xcite .",
    "we include galaxies in our sample with @xmath29 .",
    "the redshift range is chosen such that h@xmath3 measurements are available for the majority of the sample .",
    "since we are interested in the characterization of the nir emission of a galaxy , we require a minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the @xmath19 flux density .",
    "to not artificially bias our sample toward galaxies with an nir excess , we require the _ expected _ , rather than the measured , @xmath30 s / n to exceed 5 . the expected stellar @xmath19 flux density is derived from fitting the @xmath31 photometry with eazy . when fitting the seds , we assume an additional @xmath32 systematic error for every measured flux density , independent of the wavelength .",
    "we quantify the nir excess emission by fitting the @xmath28 catalogs with a linear combination of the seven pgase models in eazy , the @xmath2 pah feature @xcite and an @xmath33 graybody with a @xmath34 emissivity @xcite .",
    "we note here that an nir excess is for most galaxies only observable at @xmath35 and @xmath19 , such that the combination of the pah and the graybody feature can fit almost any observed excess . after fitting the uv to nir sed ,",
    "we require a good template fit , @xmath36 .",
    "this results in a selection that is implicitly biased against galaxies whose overall sed is strongly dominated by an agn , since we do not include agn templates or account for time variability in our data set ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also exclude galaxies with bad galfit fits ( galfit flag @xmath37 ) , signaling problems in the photometry , and strongly contaminated sources @xcite .",
    "@xmath38 galaxies pass the general selection cuts described thus far .",
    "a visual inspection of the seds demonstrates that many galaxies have excess flux above the stellar sed in the long wavelength irac bands .",
    "we verified that the magnitude of this excess is too large to be caused by blending of neighboring sources in the majority of galaxies .",
    "we aim to elucidate the origin of this excess by selecting subsamples of galaxies with a strong nir excess ( hereafter nir excess galaxies ) and those lacking such a feature ( hereafter nir min galaxies ) .",
    "we define nir excess galaxies as galaxies for which the @xmath39 of the eazy fit , including the constant @xmath32 systematic error , reduces by @xmath40 when including the pah and graybody feature , whereas nir min galaxies have @xmath41 .",
    "six example galaxies are shown in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "we exclude from this analysis galaxies that fall into the intermediate range @xmath42 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that nir min galaxies could still have a considerable nir excess , in particular if the s / n in the irac bands is @xmath43 . to allow an unbiased comparison between the two samples we construct pairs of galaxies from both groups matched by their redshift , stellar @xmath19 flux density , and @xmath19 exposure weight @xmath44 . for this sample",
    "we require @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "as described in @xcite , the weight is calculated from the inverse variance and accounts for background noise sources but not the poisson noise due to sources themselves .",
    "given that the nir stellar light is a good proxy for the total stellar mass , we arrive at a roughly mass - matched sample .",
    "additionally , pairs are chosen such that they have the same galaxy type , either star - forming or quiescent , based on the uvj classification @xcite . altogether",
    ", we obtain a sample of @xmath48 galaxy pairs .    in the following",
    ", we will analyze these galaxy pairs to study systematic differences between the two groups .",
    "in the upper panels of figure [ fig : uvj_sfms ] we show the positions of galaxies in the uvj diagram .",
    "recall that we have selected nir excess and nir min galaxies based on their nir emission , but not explicitly on their uv to optical spectrum .",
    "the most striking feature is that nir excess galaxies tend to be star - forming galaxies , while nir min galaxies are predominantly quiescent .",
    "we also note that among star - forming galaxies , nir excess galaxies seem to occupy regions farther away from the quiescent clump than nir min galaxies .",
    "we investigate where the star - forming galaxies fall compared to the star - forming main sequence ( sfms ) .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : uvj_sfms ] , where the dashed green line is the fit presented in @xcite .",
    "we see that nir excess star - forming galaxies have noticeably higher sfrs than comparable nir min galaxies .",
    "the median ratio of the ir luminosities derived from the @xmath20 flux densities is @xmath49 when comparing the nir excess and nir min galaxies .",
    "interestingly , not only do nir excess galaxies lie above the sfms , but nir min galaxies with @xmath50 , galaxies for which the upper limit on the non - stellar nir contribution is very small , tend to fall below that relation . in other words , the absence of a strong nir excess seems to indicate a reduced sfr .",
    "while the @xmath20 flux density enhancements for nir excess galaxies are compatible with increased sfr , they could also originate from agn activity .",
    "out of the sample of @xmath48 galaxy pairs , @xmath51 nir excess and only @xmath52 nir min galaxies have detections at @xmath53 .",
    "the infrared colors of these galaxies can shed light onto what process drives the far - infrared emission of these galaxies .",
    "we find @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) for all but @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) nir excess galaxies .",
    "this indicates that the fir emission of these galaxies is dominated by star formation and not nuclear activity ( compare , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the higher far - infrared detection rate of nir excess galaxies further indicates an increased sfr compared to nir min galaxies .",
    "we compare the h@xmath3 luminosities for pairs in which both galaxies have uncontaminated h@xmath3 grism spectra and at least one is detected . due to the low resolution of the grism spectra , h@xmath3 and [ ]",
    "are blended .",
    "using a sample of @xmath58 @xmath59 galaxy pairs , we find a median h@xmath3 + [ ] luminosity ratio of @xmath60 in both goods - south and goods - north when comparing nir excess to nir min galaxies .",
    "altogether , in @xmath61 of the @xmath62 pairs the nir excess galaxy has a higher total measured h@xmath3 + [ ] luminosity .    finally , we stack h@xmath3 + [ ] maps for the two groups .",
    "the details of this procedure are described in @xcite .",
    "we only stack the emission of galaxies for which both members have uncontaminated h@xmath3 grism spectra and do not host x - ray agns . as shown in figure [ fig : stackedhalpha ]",
    ", we find that the increase of the h@xmath3 equivalent width of nir excess galaxies is not limited to the center , as might have been expected if agns were the sole cause of the excess . instead",
    ", the equivalent width is enhanced at least to @xmath63 , compared to nir min galaxies , consistent with star formation being the dominant cause .",
    "we find that @xmath64 nir excess and @xmath56 nir min galaxies are detected in x - rays with _",
    "@xmath65 of the nir excess and @xmath66 of the nir min x - ray sources have been identified as secure agns by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "given this result , it is likely that at least in @xmath32 of the galaxies the nir excess is caused by weak or obscured agns .",
    "we test the presence of a large population of weak or obscured agns using a stacking analysis @xcite of galaxies in goods - south . excluding galaxies that host confirmed x - ray agns themselves or are near detected x - ray sources , we stack the x - ray emission of @xmath67 nir excess and @xmath68 nir min sources .",
    "we compare this to the expected flux from star formation alone for which we use the relation from @xcite and assume an intrinsic power - law index of @xmath69 .",
    "we use the uv+ir derived sfrs and correct for galactic absorption in the milky way . for the relation by @xcite we take into account the intrinsic log - normal scatter and a correction factor of @xmath70 because of the systematically different sfrs derived in @xcite .",
    "we find confident detections for all source groups and bands .",
    "the soft- and hard - band fluxes for the nir excess galaxies are @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "similarly , the values for the nir min galaxies are @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the expected fluxes from sfr alone are @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , respectively . given the uncertainties and scatter in the sfr@xmath83 relation",
    ", we find that the measured fluxes are broadly consistent with being primarily driven by star formation .",
    "after examining qualitative trends in a matched sample of galaxies , we analyze the entire unmatched sample .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig:3p6 ] shows rest - frame @xmath84 vs. @xmath85 colors of all star - forming galaxies in @xmath29 .",
    "the rest - frame colors were derived from the best - fit eazy model including the nir templates .",
    "the dashed line effectively separates nir excess from nir min sources .",
    "@xmath86 of all nir excess sources , regardless of having a matched counterpart , fall above the line , while @xmath86 of the nir min galaxies fall below .",
    "we also show the median ratio of the sfr with respect to the relation in @xcite . from this figure",
    "it is evident that an increased @xmath85 color , representing an nir excess , correlates well with increased @xmath87 . in the right panel of figure [ fig:3p6 ]",
    "we explicitly show the relation between the nir excess , parameterized by the rest - frame @xmath88 luminosity in excess of the expected stellar emission , and the sfr . we find a linear relation of the form @xmath89 = ( 4.0 \\pm 0.2 ) \\times 10^{41 } \\times \\mathrm{sfr}_{\\rm uv + ir } [ m_\\odot \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}].\\ ] ]",
    "in this letter we quantify and explore the origin of the nir excess over purely stellar light in galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "we find that such an excess emission is particularly common among star - forming galaxies and that the strength of the excess scales linearly with @xmath87 .",
    "we also explore the possibility that the excess could come from weak or obscured agns , but find this explanation for the majority of the galaxies unlikely based on their fir emission and x - ray luminosities and the fact that the excess is prevalent in star - forming galaxies , while being almost absent in quiescent galaxies .",
    "a major uncertainty in the present study is the template library used . in particular , different sps models predict subtly different seds in the nir , primarily due to their different treatment of dust around agb stars @xcite .",
    "an analysis of all theoretical uncertainties in the models is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : irac - colors ] the @xmath90 - [ 4.5]$ ] irac colors of @xmath91 galaxies without x - ray agns fulfilling our selection cuts . using the stellar libraries compiled by @xcite we show the predictions by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bc03 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m05 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* c09 ) for declining star formation histories with @xmath92 for all ages , metallicities , and redshifts .",
    "we also include the range of the pgase templates used in the analysis . only the c09 models span the observed range of irac colors , including star - forming galaxies . however , the very red nir colors come from stellar populations older than @xmath93 .",
    "if we limit the models to ages below @xmath94 , models with significant recent star formation , the maximum value reduces to @xmath95 and lies below the median value for star - forming galaxies . in principle",
    ", dust extinction could also lead to redder nir colors .",
    "however , explaining the difference of @xmath96 between star - forming and quiescent galaxies by optically thick star formation would require @xmath97 or higher ( compare , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is highly unlikely for the entire population of star - forming galaxies .    we conclude that an nir excess seems to be a common property of star - forming galaxies and is correlated with increased sfr .",
    "thus , the nir regime , at the moment mostly neglected when fitting galaxy seds , offers additional information about star formation in high-@xmath98 galaxies . in the near future ,",
    "spectroscopy with jwst / nirspec will elucidate the physical origin of the excess and can provide more information on the origin of the relation in figure [ fig:3p6 ] .",
