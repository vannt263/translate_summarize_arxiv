    "the distribution of the relative orientations for the 570 remaining measurements is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : relativethetas ] .",
    "there is a strong preference in alignment : 70% of polarization measurements are within 30@xmath1 of the orientation of linear features in their surrounding gas .",
    "a monte - carlo run showed that the probability of obtaining this correlation by chance is less than @xmath15 .",
    "only 8% are within 30@xmath1 of being perpendicular to their surrounding gas .",

    "the distribution contains all 570 polarization measurements that lie in the _ herschel _ image . ]      the results presented above on the alignment of filaments and @xmath0 concerned the entire map .",
    "however , both field and cloud structure are not homogeneous across the cloud .",
    "for example , there is a low column density area of striations , marked by the rectangle as region a in fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] , where @xmath0 exhibits ordered structure .",
    "adjacent to this area , towards lower latitude and longitude , in a significant portion of the map , measurements are sparse and polarization angles show substantial dispersion .    the various trends existing in the measured cloud properties can be better visualized by constructing maps of average ( smoothed ) quantities across the sky .",
    "the maps are constructed by creating a grid ( 5squares ) of the field .",
    "the value at each grid center is calculated by averaging the values of star measurements within 10of it .",
    "the final map is smoothed using a boxcar filter of 5width .",
    "[ fig : smoothmaps ] shows such maps of various quantities : ( a ) number of significant stellar polarization measurements ( @xmath16 ) , ( b ) _ herschel _ 250 @xmath10 intensity , ( c ) polarization angle , @xmath17 , ( d ) scatter of @xmath17 ,",
    "( e ) @xmath14 and ( f ) @xmath11 . only bins with at least 5 measurements",
    "were used to produce the maps ( reducing this number to 3 did not make a qualitative difference ) .",
    "the number of significant stellar polarization measurements is highest in region a , which is the bright part in the upper left of the map in panel ( a ) .",
    "the number density ( per 5@xmath18 bin ) in this area is more than twice that in the rest of the map .",
    "smaller local maxima are found : ( i ) in region b , ( ii ) in the center of the map ( 123.5@xmath1 , + 26.3@xmath1 ) and ( iii ) above the striations at ( 124.5@xmath1 , + 27.5@xmath1 ) .",
    "as noted in paper i , this variation in the number of measurements is not due to variations in stellar density across the field , or due to systematics such as observing conditions .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the _ herschel _ 250 @xmath10 image smoothed with a boxcar filter of 5width .",
    "the mcld123 filament ( region b ) stands out as a maximum of intensity . by comparing the number density of significant stellar polarization measurements to the dust emission intensity",
    "( panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) we find that the overall structure of the two maps is significantly different .",
    "therefore , the variation of the density of significant polarization measurements can not be attributed to variations in the column density .",
    "the average polarization angles in panel ( c ) are calculated as the circular mean : @xmath19 where n is the number of measurements in each bin .",
    "the average polarization angle defines a number of domains of different orientation throughout the field , separated by abrupt angle changes .",
    "the thin dark curves at the edges of some domains are an artefact of the smoothing , they do not represent measurements of 90@xmath1 .",
    "@xmath20 seems to rotate clockwise from 160@xmath1 ( bright yellow ) in region a , to 40@xmath1 ( blue ) below the center of the map .",
    "the scatter of polarization angles @xmath21 in panel ( d ) is measured using the circular standard deviation : @xmath22 the values obtained by this equation do not represent the dispersion that would characterize a normal distribution of angles .",
    "they only serve for comparison between the various areas of the map .",
    "the bright regions in panel ( d ) ( large standard deviations ) correspond to regions with very few measurements , as can be seen by comparing with panel ( a ) .",
    "region a and an area with @xmath23 in the center of the map stand out as the areas with lowest dispersion .",
    "the relative orientation of @xmath0 and the filamentary structures in the cloud , shown in panel ( e ) , is very similar to the @xmath21 map .",
    "regions characterized by a large polarization angle dispersion appear to coincide with regions where filaments are perpendicular to @xmath0 .",
    "the preference in alignment throughout the map , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : relativethetas ] , is evident , as regions with @xmath24 ( dark ) occupy most of the map area .",
    "the highest values of @xmath11 ( panel f ) are in the region of the striations .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "polarized intensity peak coincides with the brightest part of this map at ( 126@xmath1 , + 27@xmath1 ) ( see figure a.1 .",
    "in * ? ? ? * ) . the second , but lower , local maximum in @xmath11 is in region b. the spatial variation of @xmath11 resembles that of @xmath25 .",
    "this correlation is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] ( top left ) , where the average value of @xmath25 is plotted for each ( equally - populated with pixels ) @xmath11 bin .",
    "this correlation is natural , since the polarization measurements were selected in paper i to satisfy @xmath16",
    ". since the observational errors @xmath26 are uniform across the field ( paper i ) , it is more likely that a larger number of significant measurements will be obtained in regions of higher @xmath11 .        additional support to the fact that the variation in the number of significant polarization measurements is uncorrelated with the column density is given by the plot on the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] , where the visual extinction , @xmath27 , ( from the map of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is plotted against @xmath11 ( from panel f , fig .",
    "[ fig : smoothmaps ] ) .",
    "one possibility that explains the observed variation of @xmath25 is that the 3d orientation of the magnetic field varies significantly throughout the sky .",
    "if this is true , then it is expected that more significant polarization will be detected in regions where the field is mostly on the plane of the sky . in these regions , @xmath11 should be higher and this is consistent with the correlation of @xmath11 and @xmath25 that we find .",
    "also , if the field strength is more significant than turbulent gas motions , which tend to randomize its orientation ( see section [ ssec : bstrength ] ) , regions where @xmath0 is stronger ( high @xmath11 , @xmath25 ) should have a small angle scatter .",
    "this is indeed the case as can be seen in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] .",
    "however , a significant contribution to this trend is likely to be coming from the larger measurement error of lower - significance measurements ( near the cut of @xmath16 ) .",
    "if the assumption of a strong magnetic field holds , then , diffuse , non self - gravitating filaments such as the ones in this cloud are expected to be mostly parallel to the 3d field orientation .",
    "so , if the field lies mostly on the plane of the sky , the alignment of the projected field and filaments will be easily detected . if , though , the field is mostly along the line - of - sight , filaments and field can be observed as having any relative orientation .",
    "a hint of such a trend may exist in the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] .",
    "@xcite find this exact trend ( their figure 13 ) and attribute it to the same effect : the projection of the 3d field on the sky .",
    "the anti - correlation of @xmath11 with @xmath28 is also observed ( figure 21 of * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also find that the degree of alignment decreases with column density in the range @xmath4 = [ @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast to this , it is evident even visually that panels ( b ) and ( e ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : smoothmaps ] are uncorrelated @xmath2 we see no sign of such a trend .",
    "it is possible that the range of column densities in the polaris flare is significantly different than that in the work of @xcite . to investigate whether this is the case ,",
    "we convert the range of @xmath27 in the polaris flare to @xmath4 using the standard relation of @xcite : @xmath31 . from the @xmath27 map of @xcite values in the cloud vary within : @xmath32 \\ , mag \\rightarrow n_h = [ 0.4 , 2.3 ] \\times 10^{21 } cm^{-2}$ ] . because the @xcite data have a rather low resolution ( 8@xmath33 ) , this range may be underestimated .",
    "indeed , the cores in mcld123 have @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the range of @xmath4 in the cloud is comparable to that of @xcite . in their paper",
    ", the planck collaboration infer that the anti - correlation of alignment with column density is most likely due to the existence of molecular cloud structures that are perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the only available explanation for this observation is that matter in magnetically - dominated self - gravitating clouds collapses preferentially along field lines , producing structures that are elongated and perpendicular to the field .",
    "if we accept this reasoning , it should not come as a surprise that we do not find such a trend in the gravitationally unbound polaris flare .    in summary ,",
    "the above correlations seem to indicate the presence of a strong magnetic field in the cloud which may change orientation from being mostly parallel to the plane - of - the - sky in region a to being more inclined in other areas .",
    "an important morphological characteristic of filaments is their width .",
    "we use the filament trait - evaluated reconstruction ( filter ) method @xcite to construct the width distribution of filaments in the _ herschel _ image .",
    "filter takes as input the skeleton of an image and finds the width of the elongated structures . for this purpose ,",
    "a gaussian is fit to the radial profile at every point along the filament axis , and the resulting fwhm is deconvolved by the beam size .",
    "the skeleton is produced by disperse @xcite which is a topological code that can extract the filamentary structures of an image .",
    "it is designed to connect local maxima ( cores ) .",
    "this property renders the construction of a representative skeleton difficult , because a significant part of the polaris flare does not contain bright cores . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhtmap ] , the rht produces a visualization of filamentary structures irrespective of brightness .",
    "this enables us to apply disperse to the rht backprojection image and obtain a representative skeleton of the _ herschel _ image to use as input to filter .    the distribution of filament widths in the _ herschel _ image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : widths ] .",
    "the distribution has a peak at 0.06 pc and a spread of @xmath35 , twice as much as the typical error in the width determination ( @xmath36 ) in our implementation of the code .",
    "the intrinsic spread of the distribution is : @xmath37 .",
    "though lower than the characteristic width of 0.1 pc ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the peak value found here falls within the spread of the distributions from these works .",
    "we investigate whether there are trends in the distribution of widths across the cloud , by constructing a smoothed map of the widths found by filter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : widthmap ] ) .",
    "we use a boxcar filter of the same size as the maps in fig . [",
    "fig : smoothmaps ] ( 5 , or 0.2 pc ) to allow for a better visual comparison .",
    "the map shows fluctuations in the width of filaments that do not appear to have any large - scale systematic trend .",
    "this remains the case for maps with smaller smoothing kernels .",
    "however , when comparing the distribution of widths within region a ( fig .",
    "[ fig : widthsstriations ] , left , dotted red line ) to that of the rest of the map ( solid black line ) , we find that the former is slightly shifted towards lower values .",
    "a ks test rejects the hypothesis that the two originate from the same parent distribution at the 0.001 level . in constructing the distributions we discard structures with lengths less than 0.2 pc , as these have too small aspect ratios to be considered filamentary .",
    "there is an indication that the shift towards lower widths becomes more pronounced as we raise this threshold to 0.4 pc .",
    "having explored the various observed properties of the cloud and their variation across the map , we now focus on the two regions of interest defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] .",
    "region a contains striking features both in dust emission ( appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in polarization ( fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] ) . both @xmath0 and striation orientations throughout the area are ordered .",
    "this is apparent in the distribution of polarization angles shown in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : striationplots ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath17 resembles a normal distribution with a mean at @xmath38 and a standard deviation of @xmath39 . the mean observational error ( panel b )",
    "is 7.6@xmath1 while the 80@xmath40 percentile of the distribution is 10@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , a significant contribution to the observed spread is due to the measurement error .",
    "in addition to this uniformity , the mean directions of the field and dust structures appear to be aligned and this occurs to a greater extent than in the rest of the map .",
    "this is supported by the comparison of the normalized cdfs of @xmath14 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : striationplots ] , panel ( c ) . inside the region ( dashed red line )",
    "75% of the differences",
    "@xmath14 lie in the range [ 0@xmath1 , 30@xmath1 ] , whereas outside ( solid black ) only 63% are in the same range .",
    "another characteristic of region a is that it exhibits a higher fractional linear polarization than the rest of the map , as seen in panel ( f ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : smoothmaps ] .",
    "we compare the distribution of @xmath11 in region a ( filled red ) and in the rest of the map ( black empty ) in panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : striationplots ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath11 in the region extends to higher values than out of the area , and that the mean @xmath11 ( dashed line : out , dotted line : in ) is lower outside the region .     in region",
    "a ( filled red ) and the rest of the map ( empty black ) , dashed and dotted lines are their average values . ]",
    "region b shows a rather different picture than region a. in this area , which is the densest part of the cloud , the plane - of - the - sky field seems to bend along the mcld123 filament .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mcld ] shows the distribution of @xmath17 for this region while the right panel shows the distribution of relative orientations , @xmath14 , for region b ( filled red ) and the rest of the map ( empty black ) .",
    "the mean of the distribution of @xmath17 is 90@xmath1 , and the standard deviation is 25@xmath1 .",
    "the spread is partly due to the large - scale curvature of @xmath0 in the vicinity and on the mcld123 filament .",
    "the values of @xmath14 show a slight preference for alignment , although they extend to angles consistent with orthogonality .     for region",

    "the role of the magnetic field in the two regions discussed above can be investigated further by estimating the strength of the plane - of - the - sky magnetic field and by comparing the magnetic energy to that of turbulent motions .",
    "polarization measurements can be used to estimate the strength of @xmath0 under the assumption that the polarization angle dispersion ( @xmath42 ) is caused by the action of hydromagnetic waves perpendicular to the ( mean ) magnetic field @xcite(dcf ) .",
    "based on the idea that a strong field will resist distortion and therefore , @xmath42 will be small , dcf derive : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the volume mass density of the gas and @xmath45 is the velocity dispersion perpendicular to the observed field ( along the line - of - sight ) .",

    "the values for @xmath60 obtained for both regions are consistent within the errors of the fits . inserting the value for @xmath62 and @xmath60 from the fits into equation [ eqn : bhoude ] we obtain estimates for the ratio @xmath82 : 0.2@xmath20.5 for region a and 0.3@xmath83 for region b. the line - of - sight depth of each region used for these estimates",
    "is presented and discussed in the next section .    within our adopted uncertainties ,",
    "the ratios in both regions are less than 1 .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic field is much stronger than the turbulent component in region a and at most comparable to the turbulent component in region b. moreover , equation [ eqn : dcf ] can be written as : @xmath84 @xcite , where @xmath85 is the alfvn speed and @xmath45 the velocity dispersion perpendicular to the mean field . from this",
    "we can conclude that turbulent motions are most likely sub - alfvnic in region a and could be sub- to trans - alfvnic in region b. this is consistent with the conclusion of @xcite that the magnetic field is dynamically important in region b. these authors found that motions in mcld123 are trans - alfvnic , using the dispersion of position angles of diffuse @xmath86 filaments .",
    "having inferred the value of @xmath87 from the h09 method , we now move on to find the values of the remaining quantities that enter into equation [ eqn : dcf ] and use them to obtain an estimate for @xmath0 in both regions .",
    "we present the values used in obtaining these estimates in table [ tab : dcf ] .",
    "the gas mass density is equal to : @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , @xmath90 is a factor that accounts for the fraction of helium and @xmath91 is the total hydrogen number density . the total @xmath91 must be used and not @xmath92 because even though the cloud is molecular , the fraction of gas that is in atomic form may be important ( @xmath93 * ? ? ?",
    "to estimate the density in region b , we assume that mcld123 has a cylindrical geometry .",
    "this implies a line - of - sight dimension of @xmath94 pc , where the lower bound is twice the observed extent of the dense part of the filament and the upper bound is found including the more diffuse parts .",
    "the average @xmath95 from the map of @xcite is @xmath96 , corresponding to an @xmath97 .",
    "dividing by the assumed line - of - sight dimension gives @xmath98 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we can obtain a loose constraint on the mean density of region a by arguing that it is likely to be less than that of region b ( since the latter contains cores ) .",
    "an upper bound would therefore be @xmath99 . a lower limit on the density can be estimated by considering existing measurements of @xmath91 from uv data of stars in diffuse sightlines .",
    "a set of measurements from various works has been collected by @xcite who shows that most sightlines with @xmath100 have measured densities : @xmath101 ( assuming @xmath102 ) .",
    "the column density in region a is estimated to @xmath4 according to @xcite : @xmath31 for @xmath103 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ] by @xmath104 , where we have assumed that the temperature distribution is quasi - uniform throughout the cloud @xcite so that intensity ( @xmath105 ) variations in the _ herschel _ image are mostly caused by @xmath4 fluctuations . since the polaris flare is a molecular cloud , we reason that @xmath106 ( the upper limit from the aforementioned sightlines ) is an appropriate approximation .",
    "the line - of - sight dimension of region a is then ( @xmath107 ) @xmath108 .",
    "the upper limit is approximately one third of the size of the region as projected on the sky , while the lower limit is similar to the assumed @xmath71 in region b. we expect that the true @xmath71 lies mostly near the lower limit of this range , because due to the translucent nature of the cloud , the line - of - sight dimension should not be very large . studies of cirrus clouds in general find a high likelihood of them being sheet - like ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "along with the fact that regions a and b have similar mean @xmath27 ( table [ tab : dcf ] ) , this implies that @xmath71 in the two regions should not vary by orders of magnitude .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : distances ]    in the literature there is no definitive consensus on the cloud s distance .",
    "the existing estimates are shown in table [ tab : distances ] along with the method that was used to obtain each one .",
    "@xcite base their distance estimate on reddening estimates of stars in the field from @xcite , who found reddened stars from distances as close as 100 pc and that all stars farther than 300 pc were reddened . knowing that polaris ( the star ) showed dust - induced polarization , and that the then existing distance estimates to the star were 109 - 240 pc they placed the cloud at a distance @xmath109 pc .",

    "@xcite compared iras 100 @xmath10 emission with optical images of mcld123 and found that the brightness ratios are consistent with polaris ( the star ) being the illuminating source of the cloud in the optical .",
    "they placed the cloud at a distance 6 @xmath2 25 pc in front of the star ( @xmath111 from the sun ) so that its contribution in dust heating would be minimal compared to the interstellar radiation field .",
    "@xcite used principal component analysis ( pca ) of spectral imaging data to infer distances based on the universality of the size - linewidth relation for molecular clouds .",
    "their estimate is consistent with both the above estimates .",
    "@xcite used accurate photometry measurements of the pan - starrs1 survey and calculated distances to most known molecular clouds .",
    "their estimate for the distance of the polaris flare ( 390 pc ) , was obtained for lines of sight in the outskirts of the cloud ( outside our observed field ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : northstar ] ( top ) we zoom in on the region surrounding the north star and overplot the polarization data ( red ) and the measurement of the north star ( white ) from the @xcite catalogue on the _ herschel _ image .",

    "the position of the north star is marked with a blue star .",
    "the star happens to be projected on an area of very little dust emission , hence the low @xmath11 .",
    "magnetic field orientations in the area show a strong peak around @xmath112 , with a few measurements ( that happen to fall towards the right and bottom of the area ) clustering around @xmath113 .",
    "this can be seen in the distribution of angles in the area shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : northstar ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the polarization angle of the north star @xcite is shown with the dark gray vertical line and the light gray band shows the 1 @xmath110 error .",
    "the stars that are nearest to polaris , in projection , belong to the peak at 100@xmath1 .",
    "the fact that the orientation of the north star s polarization is consistent with this peak is intriguing .",
    "it could add to the evidence supporting that polaris is behind the flare , constraining its distance to the @xcite estimate .",
    "however , since the orientation of stellar polarization shifts by a substantial amount ( 60@xmath1 ) in @xmath114 , denser sampling of the area is needed in order to ascertain this indication .",
    "we combined robopol optical polarization measurements and _ herschel _ dust emission data to infer the magnetic field properties of the polaris flare .",
    "we found that linear dust structures ( filaments and striations ) are preferentially aligned with the projected magnetic field .",
    "this alignment is more prominent in regions where the fractional linear polarization is highest ( and the number of significant polarization measurements is largest ) .",
    "this correlation supports the idea that variations in the alignment are partly caused by the projection of the 3-dimensional magnetic field .",
    "we investigated the possibility of important spatial variations in the filament widths and found only a slight indication of such an effect . using the @xcite and @xcite methods , we estimated the strength of the plane - of - the - sky field and the ratio of turbulent - to - ordered field components in two regions of the cloud : one containing diffuse striations , and the other harbouring the highest column density filament .",
    "our results indicate that the magnetic field is dynamically important in both regions . combining our results",
    ", we find that differences of @xmath115 in the magnetic field inclination between two cloud regions can explain the observed polarization fraction differences .",
    "this difference can also be explained by a difference in the line - of - sight dispersion of the field of @xmath116 .",
    "finally , we find that the polarization angles of the north star @xcite and of robopol data in the surrounding area favour the scenario of the cloud being in front of the star .",
