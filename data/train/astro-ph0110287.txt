    "line driven winds ( ldws ) occur in various astronomical objects , like ob and wolf - rayet stars , in accretion disks in cataclysmic variables and , probably , in active galactic nuclei and luminous young stellar objects .",
    "these winds are powered by absorption and re - emission of photospheric continuum flux in numerous spectral transitions of c , n , o , fe , etc .",
    "castor , abbott , & klein ( 1975 ; hereafter cak ) have analyzed the steady state euler equation for ldws .",
    "they found an infinite family of mathematical solutions , but only one , hereafter ` critical solution ' , which extends from the photosphere to arbitrary large radii .",
    "other solutions either do not reach infinity or the photosphere . the former solutions are called shallow and the latter ones steep .",
    "the unique , critical wind starts as the fastest shallow solution and switches smoothly to the slowest steep solution at the critical point .",
    "observational support that ldws adopt the critical solution comes from measured terminal speeds ( abbott 1982 ) .",
    "furthermore , mass loss rates of supergiant winds are in general agreement with modified cak theory ( lamers & leitherer 1993 ; puls et al .",
    "these measurements were recently extended to include galactic and extragalactic ob and a stars and central stars of planetary nebula ( kudritzki et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "abbott ( 1980 ) put cak theory in a complete analogy to the solar wind and nozzle flows .",
    "the existence of a sonic point defines the unique , transsonic solutions for these flows , whereas the existence of a critical point for abbott waves defines the unique , cak solution for ldws . only from below this critical point",
    ", abbott waves can propagate upstream towards the photosphere . above the critical point , they are advected outwards . because abbott waves generally propagate highly supersonically , the critical point of ldws lies at much higher speeds than the sonic point .",
    "abbott s ( 1980 ) analysis was challenged by owocki & rybicki ( 1986 ) , who derived the green s function for a pure absorption ldw .",
    "the green s function gives correct signal speeds in presence of hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "the inward signal speed in a pure absorption line wind is the sound speed , and not the much larger abbott speed , because photons propagate outwards only .",
    "owocki & rybicki ( 1986 ) showed that a fiducial upstream signal , which still propagates inward at abbott speed , must be interpreted as _ purely local _",
    "taylor series reconstruction . for a flow driven by scattering lines ,",
    "however , owocki & puls ( 1999 ) find _ physically relevant _",
    "abbott waves for a numerical green s function .    in the present paper ,",
    "we further analyze the properties of abbott waves .",
    "we show that they are crucial for our understanding of stability of ldws and must be included in the courant time step .",
    "so far , time - dependent numerical simulations of ldws from stars and accretion disks have ignored the ability of abbott waves to communicate in the supersonic regime , which results in a numerical runaway . in particular",
    ", this runaway can lift the wind to the critical solution .",
    "the critical solution is also enforced by applying pure outflow boundary conditions .",
    "it is often argued that outflow boundary conditions are appropriate since ldws are highly supersonic .",
    "instead , they have to be _ super - abbottic_. we show that shallow wind solutions , which correspond to solar wind breezes , are everywhere sub - abbottic . hence , these solutions are numerically destabilized by applying outflow boundary conditions .",
    "we formulate boundary conditions which render shallow solutions numerically stable . those include non - reflecting riemann conditions for abbott waves . by allowing for kinks in the velocity law",
    ", shallow solutions can be made globally admissible .",
    "in the cak model for ldws , both gravity and line force scale with @xmath0 . if the sound speed and hence the pressure forces are set to zero , this leads to a degeneracy of the critical point condition , which is satisfied formally at every radius ( poe , owocki , & castor  1990 ) .",
    "thus , for this case , abbott waves can not propagate inwards from any location in the wind . for finite sound speed , they creep inwards at small speed . inclusion of the finite disk correction factor is much more relevant for ldws than inclusion of pressure forces . with",
    "the finite disk included , the inward speed of abbott waves below the critical point is significantly larger than the wind speed .",
    "unfortunately , the finite disk correction factor depends on the ( unknown ) velocity law of the wind , which prevents a simple analysis of the wind dynamics .",
    "we consider , therefore , a wind model which is analytically feasible and yet prevents the ( near-)degeneracy of the cak point - star wind .",
    "( especially , the latter leads to poor convergence of time - dependent numerical schemes . ) as a prototype , a vertical ldw from an isothermal , geometrically thin , non - self - gravitating accretion disk is assumed .",
    "the sound speed is set to zero .",
    "keplerian rotation is assumed within the disk and angular momentum conservation above the disk .",
    "this reduces the flow problem to a 1-d , planar one .",
    "the radiative flux above an isothermal disk is roughly constant at small heights . on the other hand ,",
    "the vertical gravity component along the wind cylinder is zero in the disk midplane , grows linearly with @xmath1 if @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 the footpoint radius in the disk ) , reaches a maximum , and drops off at large @xmath1 . to model the launch region of the wind and the gravity maximum , we choose @xmath4 , with normalization @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 being gravitational constant , and @xmath8 is the mass of the central object .",
    "the different spatial dependence of flux and gravity results in a well - defined critical point in the flow .    for constant radiative flux ,",
    "the cak line force becomes @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the density and velocity , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constants .",
    "we choose @xmath14 .",
    "typical values of @xmath12 from nlte calculations ( pauldrach 1987 ) and kramers law ( puls , springmann , & lennon 2000 ) are @xmath15 to 0.7",
    ". the constant @xmath13 can be expressed in terms of the unique , critical cak mass loss rate .",
    "this is the maximum allowed mass loss rate for a stationary wind .",
    "we introduce new fluid variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 where a subsript ` c ' refers to the critical cak solution . for stationary ,",
    "plane parallel winds , the continuity equation becomes @xmath19 , and @xmath16 is a constant . in the following",
    ", the quantity @xmath20 will play a central role .",
    "the velocity law , @xmath21 , is obtained by quadrature of the wind ` solution ' @xmath22 . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the stationary euler equation becomes , @xmath23 where we multiplied the nominator and denominator in the line force by @xmath11 , and introduced @xmath24 , the gravity at the location of the cak critical point .",
    "the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath1 is supressed in the equation .",
    "the constant @xmath13 was determined as follows .",
    "equation  ( [ euler ] ) is a quadratic equation in @xmath26 .",
    "consider the @xmath27 plane . for arbitrary @xmath1 and sufficiently small @xmath16 , the crossings",
    "@xmath28 of the parabola @xmath29 with the abscissa determine two wind solutions @xmath22 , termed shallow and steep .",
    "when @xmath16 increases , the crossings approach each other , and merge at some maximum @xmath30 , beyond which no further solutions exist .",
    "hence , the _ singularity condition _",
    "@xmath31 holds when two solutions merge , as is the case at the critical point .",
    "together with @xmath28 , this gives @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we add a comment which is important for the following . at every location @xmath34 , @xmath35 for the parabola which meets the abscissa in just one point .",
    "the minimum , @xmath36 , is reached at the unique critical point , @xmath37 , which is the flow _ nozzle _ and determines the maximum mass loss which can be driven from the photosphere to infinity .",
    "solutions ( actually , pairs of shallow and steep solutions ) with @xmath35 are called _",
    "overloaded_. they correspond to a _ choked _ laval nozzle flow .",
    "these solutions become imaginary in a neigborhood of the critical point .",
    "we have shown elsewhere ( feldmeier & shlosman 2000 ) how overloaded ldw solutions can be made globally defined , by letting them decelerate , @xmath38 , around the critical point .",
    "the _ position _ of the critical point is determined by the _ regularity _",
    "condition , which is derived next . since @xmath28 everywhere",
    ", @xmath39 holds too . since @xmath40",
    ", it follows that @xmath41 , if @xmath42 .",
    "this latter condition singles out the unique critical point , since overloaded winds have kinks at the merging point of two solutions , @xmath43 .",
    "hence , the critical point lies at the gravity maximum , @xmath44 . for @xmath4 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the line force in ( [ euler ] ) becomes @xmath47 .",
    "this holds for any solution , whether shallow or steep . solving ( [ euler ] ) for @xmath26 , @xmath48 where we introduced a new variable @xmath49 .",
    "the signs refer to steep ( @xmath50 ) and shallow ( @xmath51 ) solutions . for @xmath36 , the square root in ( [ eulersol ] )",
    "vanishes at the critical point . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the root becomes imaginary in a neighborhood of the critical point .",
    "the solutions @xmath22 of ( [ eulersol ] ) have a saddle topology in the @xmath52 plane when @xmath16 is varied from @xmath53 to @xmath35 .",
    "the critical point @xmath54 is the saddle point .",
    "a variable radiative flux above a non - isothermal accretion disk leads instead to two different @xmath37 , above and below the gravity maximum ( feldmeier & shlosman 1999 ) .",
    "the lower is a saddle , the upper an extremum .",
    "note that the cak critical point of ldws is a saddle in the @xmath55 plane , whereas the sonic point of the solar wind is a saddle in the @xmath56 plane . in all other respects ,",
    "we find a deep analogy between ldws and the solar wind .",
    "only the notion of a critical speed is replaced by a critical acceleration .",
    "shallow solutions are the analogs to solar wind breezes .    according to ( [ eulersol ] ) , shallow and steep solutions with @xmath57",
    "extend from @xmath58 to @xmath59 for the present model with zero sound speed .",
    "cak found that steep solutions start supersonically at the wind base @xmath58 , which seems unphysical . in a spherically symmetric wind",
    ", shallow solutions do not extend to arbitrarily large @xmath1 , because they can not provide the required expansion work .",
    "these two results and the requirement for a continuous and differentiable solution implies that the wind has to pass through the critical point .",
    "it starts on the fastest shallow , and ends on the slowest steep solution .",
    "figure  1 ( which is adapted from fig .  4 in abbott 1980 or fig .",
    "8.13 in lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) shows the ldw solution topology in the @xmath60 plane , for a finite sound speed . in region ( ii ) , which is spatially the most extended in real ldws , shallow and steep solutions exist at each point @xmath61 . if @xmath34 , these solution pairs may be overloaded . in the subsonic region ( i ) , only shallow solutions ( possibly overloaded ) exist ; steep solutions are necessarily supersonic",
    ". correspondingly , only steep solutions ( possibly overloaded ) exist in region ( iii ) .",
    "no solutions exist in regions ( iv ) and ( v ) .",
    "note that the gap in overloaded solutions around @xmath37 can be bridged by an extended decelerating region , @xmath62 .",
    "= 8.4 cm    the argument by cak ruling out global , steep solutions is stringent , but the exclusion of shallow solutions seems too restrictive .",
    "the pressure force due to spherical expansion becomes important only at very large distances from the wind base . according to cak ,",
    "shallow solutions break down around 300 stellar radii for realistic o  star wind parameters .",
    "most shallow solutions have by then overcome the local escape speed .",
    "shallow solutions can be globally defined by a slight generalization of the cak approach , allowing for negative @xmath63 in the line force @xmath64 .",
    "this can be done by replacing @xmath65 by @xmath66 or by @xmath67 .",
    "the former expresses the ` blindness ' of purely local line driving to flow acceleration or deceleration .",
    "the latter accounts for the nonlocal effect of shadowing in non - monotonic velocity laws , creating a resonance coupling .",
    "all radiation is assumed to be absorbed at the first resonance location .",
    "realistically , the value of the line force lies between these extremes .",
    "the decelerating wind solution , @xmath68 , is unique , and does not split into shallow and steep branches .",
    "hyperbolic differential equations allow for weak discontinuities , which are represented in the @xmath52 plane by jumps between different solution branches .",
    "hence , a shallow solution may jump onto the decelerating branch .",
    "even an overloaded solution can avoid becoming imaginary by jumping onto the decelerating branch in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "this opens the possibility that global solutions can be composed in a piecewise manner .",
    "jumps in @xmath25 introduce _ kinks _ in @xmath21 .",
    "such kinks have been found on various occasions in time - dependent ldw simulations .",
    "they may play a central role in the observed _ discrete absorption components _ in non - saturated p  cygni line profiles ( cranmer & owocki 1996 ) . in ldws from accretion disks in cataclysmic variables , a jump onto the decelerating branch even occurs for the critical solution , which would elsewhere not extend to infinity ( feldmeier & shlosman 1999 ) .",
    "hence , the smoothness argument of cak can not be used to disqualify shallow solutions .",
    "the time - dependent continuity and euler equation for the present wind model are , @xmath69 in the euler equation , @xmath70 is assumed .",
    "the case @xmath71 will be discussed later .",

    "we discuss now the outer boundary conditions for shallow solutions .",

    "advection is solved in the conservative control volume approach , using monotonic van leer ( 1977 ) interpolation .",
    "the sound speed is set exactly to zero , and a small amount of artificial viscosity is added to handle occasional shock fronts .",
    "details on the scheme can be found in reile & gehren ( 1991 ) and feldmeier ( 1995 ) .    in a first step ,",
    "we consider simple boundary conditions for @xmath10 and @xmath11 which still preserve essential features of abbott waves .",

    "we find that using @xmath128 and @xmath129 instead destabilizes shallow solutions .      in time - dependent hydrodynamic simulations published so far , it is customary to insert the _ sound _ speed in the courant time step , @xmath130 with courant number @xmath131 , and the minimum has to be taken over the mesh .",
    "we see now that abbott waves , as characteristic inward wave mode , have to be included in the courant time step , @xmath132 where @xmath95 is in the fluid frame now .",
    "note that @xmath95 changes sign with @xmath65 .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath70 and for arbitrary @xmath71 , abbott waves determine the time step . at velocity plateaus where the wind velocity is more or less constant , @xmath133 from ( [ chareul ] ) , and the courant time step @xmath134 .",
    "this is an artifact of sobolev approximation in which the line radiation force tends to zero in the absence of velocity gradients . in practice ,",

    "our results are not sensitive to the value of this minimum @xmath49 , if the latter is sufficiently small .",
    "furthermore , velocity plateaus quickly acquire a tilt and propagate at finite speed .",
    "we can then formulate _ non - reflecting _ boundary conditions for the riemann invariants @xmath10 and @xmath103 , which annihilate incoming waves .",

    "we discuss here the numerical stability of shallow and steep solutions , depending on the appropriate courant time step and boundary conditions .",
    "we start with steep solutions , and show that they are unconditionally stable , even when simplified boundary conditions analogous to ( [ simpleboundary ] ) are used . according to ( [ eulersol ] ) , @xmath139 everywhere for steep solutions , and abbott waves can propagate only towards larger @xmath1 . at the outer boundary ,",

    "we find that steep solutions are stable for both types of boundary conditions .",
    "even when the initial conditions differ profoundly from a steep wind , the numerical code converges to the latter .",
    "furthermore , we performed tests with an explicit , harmonic perturbation at fixed eulerian position in the wind .",

    "we present a simplified model for line driven winds from stars and accretion disks which avoids the @xmath0 degeneracy of the cak model . radiative or abbott waves are derived , both from a dispersion and a characteristic analysis , and for all possible solutions to the euler equation , i.e. , shallow , critical , steep and overloaded ones .",
    "we find that abbott waves can propagate upstream , towards the photosphere , from any position along a shallow wind solution .",
    "hence , for the latter , they can enter the calculational grid through the outer boundary .",
    "the wave propagation speed depends on the velocity slope of the wind .",
    "abbott s ( 1980 ) result that these waves are creeping , i.e. , have only slighly negative inward speeds , holds globally only for the almost degenerate cak point - star model . in more realistic wind models ,",
    "abbott waves can limit the courant time step .",
    "both the neglect of abbott waves in the courant time step and in the boundary conditions leads to numerical runaway , towards the critical wind solution of maximum mass loss rate or to accretion flow .",
    "if , instead , incoming waves are annihilated at the outer boundary and the correct courant timestep is used , shallow solutions are stable .",

    "we adopt the following procedure to calculate @xmath10 and @xmath11 on a boundary .",
    "( i ) if the @xmath10 wave leaves the grid , @xmath148 is calculated using one - sided , interior differentials .",

    "( iv ) if @xmath103 enters the grid , @xmath152 is set , assuming wkb waves .",
    "( v ) the new values for @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the boundary are found by integrating @xmath153 and @xmath154 using a time - explicit scheme .    in the latter step ( v ) ,",
    "one actually needs @xmath155 , not @xmath154 . to integrate from time step @xmath156 to @xmath157 at the outer boundary ,",
    "using @xmath154 , we write @xmath158 using @xmath159 , and similarly for @xmath160 , this becomes , @xmath161 whence @xmath162 depends on @xmath163 . due to frequent variable updating in an operator splitting scheme during the time step",
    ", @xmath163 would have to be stored as an extra variable .",
    "this seems not desirable , and causes indeed numerical runaway of shallow solutions .",
    "fortunately , a simple approximation to ( [ memory ] ) gives satisfactory results , namely setting @xmath164 , or @xmath165",
    "for numerical stability tests , we assume the following parameters , if not otherwise stated : 200 equidistant grid points from @xmath166 to @xmath167 .",
    "below @xmath166 , the stationary wind speed is very small . since @xmath168 , one has @xmath169 for an inner boundary @xmath170 .",
    "even small perturbations @xmath171 cause then negative speeds at @xmath172 .",
    "this alters the direction of the @xmath10 characteristic , and often causes numerical problems .",
    "a shallow solution with @xmath173 serves as start model .",
    "the sound speed is set to zero .",
    "the flow time from @xmath166 to @xmath167 is 12.4 for a shallow solution with @xmath173 , and 9.1 for the critical solution ( in the units specified in the main text ) . for @xmath173 ,",
