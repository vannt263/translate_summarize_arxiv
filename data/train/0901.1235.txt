    "in physics of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) one of the major problems is related to the understanding of origin of the high energy radiation .",
    "one prominent class of agns is the so - called bl lac objects - supermassive black holes characterized by rapid and large amplitude flux variability . by using the radio observations from the green bank 91-m telescope @xcite , the agn , 1es 0806 + 524 , was identified as a bl lac object @xcite .    recently , by veritas was found that the blazar , 1es 0806 + 524 reveals vhe spectra in the tev domain @xcite . according to the standard model of bl lacs , vhe radiation originates from the isc of soft photons against ultra - relativistic electrons @xcite . however , the origin of efficient acceleration of particles up to highly relativistic energies still remains uncertain and needs to be revealed .",
    "proposed mechanisms based on the fermi - type acceleration process @xcite may be applied successfully for the tev emission , only , if the initial lorentz factors of electrons are considerably high ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "it is clear that in the rotating magnetospheres ( the innermost region of agn jets and pulsar magnetospheres ) the centrifugal effect should play a significant role in the overall dynamics of corresponding plasmas .",
    "for example , the rotationally driven parametric plasma instabilities have been studied for pulsars @xcite and agns @xcite respectively , and was shown , that under certain conditions , the relativistic effects of rotation may efficiently induce plasma instabilities , parametrically pumping the rotational energy directly into the plasma waves .",
    "the centrifugally induced outflows have been discussed in a series of works .",
    "blandford & payne in the pioneering paper @xcite considered the angular momentum and energy pumping process from the accretion disk , emphasizing a special role of the centrifugal force in dynamical processes governing the acceleration of plasmas .",
    "it was shown that the outflows from accretion disks occurred if the magnetic field lines are inclined at a certain angle to the equatorial plane of the disk . in the context of studying the nonthermal radiation from pulsars ,",
    "the centrifugal effect has been examined in @xcite , where the curvature emission of accelerated particles was studied . by applying the similar approach , gangadhara & lesch considered the role of centrifugal acceleration on the energetics of electrons moving along the magnetic field lines of spinning agns @xcite .",
    "this work was reconsidered in a series of papers @xcite and the method was applied to a special class of agns - tev agns .",
    "it was shown that consideration of straight field lines is a good approximation and was found that the centrifugal force may accelerate electrons up to very high lorentz factors ( @xmath3 ) providing the tev energy emission via the ics .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate a role of rotational effects in the vhe flare from the blazar 1es 0806 + 524 , by applying the method of centrifugal outflows , developed in @xcite .",
    "we show that , for a certain set of parameters , due to the ics in the thomson regime , photons , when upscattered against centrifugally accelerated ultra - relativistic electrons , produce the vhe radiation in the tev domain .",
    "we show that a resulting luminosity output is in a good agreement with the observed data .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in  [ sec : con ] we consider our model and derive expressions of the luminosity output and the energy of photons respectively . in ",
    "[ sec : dis ] we present the results for the blazar 1es 0806 + 524 and in  [ sec : sum ] we summarize our results .",
    "let us consider the typical parameters of 1es 0806 + 524 : the black hole mass , @xmath4 @xcite , ( @xmath5 is the solar mass ) and the bolometric luminosity , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we examine particles originating from the accretion disc at the distance @xmath7 from the central object , where @xmath8 is the gravitational radius of the black hole .",
    "then , by taking the value of the equipartition magnetic field , @xmath9 into account , one can show that for typical parameters , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , the value of the ratio , @xmath13 , is in the following interval @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are electrons initial lorentz factor , the density and the rest mass respectively ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field energy density exceeds the plasma energy density by many orders of magnitude , which indicates that the plasma co - rotates with the angular velocity , @xmath18 corresponding to the keplerian motion at @xmath19 .",
    "we see that due to the frozen - in condition the particles follow the co - rotating magnetic field lines and accelerate centrifugally .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to consider dynamics of the electron , sliding along the rotating magnetic field lines .",
    "we apply the method developed for agns in @xcite and assume that the straight field lines co - rotate .",
    "then , if we take an angle @xmath20 between the magnetic field , @xmath21 , and the angular velocity of rotation , @xmath22 , into account , after the transformation of coordinates : @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the minkowskian metric , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , the metric in the co - moving frame of reference is given by @xcite @xmath29    for the equation of motion we get : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 then , by taking the four velocity identity , @xmath34 , into account , one can derive from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) the radial equation of motion @xcite : @xmath35.\\ ] ] solving eq .",
    "( [ eul_0 ] ) , it is straightforward to show that the lorentz factor of the particle changes radially as @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the initial position and the initial radial velocity of the particle , respectively and @xmath40 is the radius of the light cylinder - a hypothetical zone , where the linear velocity of rigid rotation exactly equals the speed of light , @xmath41 .    as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ gama ] ) , in due course of time the lorentz factors of electrons become very high in the vicinity of the light cylinder ( @xmath42 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that acceleration lasts until the electron encounters a photon , which in turn inevitably limits the lorentz factor of the particle . during the ics",
    "an electron will lose energy , whereas a photon will gain energy .",
    "this mechanism is characterized by the so - called cooling timescale @xcite @xmath43 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the energy density of the radiation .",
    "the acceleration process is characterized by the acceleration timescale , @xmath45 , which after applying eq .",
    "( [ gama ] ) can be presented by @xmath46 generally speaking , initially the electrons accelerate , but in due course of time the role of the inverse compton losses increase and the acceleration becomes less efficient .",
    "the maximum energy attainable by electrons is achieved at a moment when the energy gain is balanced by the energy losses due to ics .",
    "mathematically this means that the following condition @xmath47 has to be satisfied . after applying eqs .",
    "( [ cool],[tacc ] ) the aforementioned condition leads to the expression of the maximum lorentz factor @xcite @xmath48 ^ 2 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 .",
    "if electrons with such high kinetic energies encounter soft photons having energy , @xmath50 , then , photons energy after scattering is given by @xmath51 as we have already mentioned , the particles reach maximum kinetic energy almost on the lc surface .",
    "let us assume that a layer where the ics takes place and the high energy photons are produced has a thickness , @xmath52 .",
    "then , for the corresponding infinitesimal volume of a cylindrical layer we get : @xmath53 if we take a single particle thomson power @xmath54 into account , then the total power emitted from the radiation zone can be expressed as follows @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "according to the observations of veritas , performed from november 2006 to april 2008 , the blazar 1es0806 + 524 , has the vhe emission with the intrinsic photon spectrum , @xmath58 , and the intrinsic integral flux , @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "then the intrinsic differential photon spectrum can be easily restored by the integral flux    @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity above @xmath63 up to @xmath64 can be estimated as follows : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that the high energy emission originates from the jet , having an opening angle , @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 ) . @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the distance to the blazar .    by taking the parameters into account",
    ", one can see from eq .",
    "( [ lum1 ] ) that the luminosity in the energy interval @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 according to the standard theory , it is well known that the accretion disks thermally radiate and the corresponding temperature is expressed as in the following way @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the dimensionless mass accretion rate , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    for the given luminosity , the mass accretion rate can be estimated as : @xmath78 then , combining eqs .",
    "( [ tem],[dm ] ) one can show that energy , @xmath79 , of accretion disc s thermal photons emitted in the area from @xmath80 to @xmath81 is of order @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , as we see from eq .",
    "( [ ener ] ) , for producing energies from thousands of @xmath83 to @xmath84 domain , one requires very high lorentz factors @xmath85 .",
    "one can see that the aforementioned values of lorentz factors are achieved for very low inclination angles . in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] we show @xmath86 as a function of the inclination angle .",
    "the set of parameters is @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "as is clear from the figure , the electrons reach high values of the lorentz factor for small angles , @xmath0 .",
    "this is a natural result because , one can straightforwardly show from eq .",
    "( [ gmax ] ) , that @xmath91 behaves as @xmath92 and therefore , provides higher kinetic energies for lower inclinations .",
    "the present model is based on an assumption that maximum kinetic energy of particles is determined by the balance of energy gain due to the acceleration and energy losses due to the ics .",
    "generally speaking , this approach is valid only if the energy losses is dominated by the ics . on the other hand ,",
    "apart from the inverse compton scattering , also the curvature radiation could impose significant limitations @xcite .",
    "the centrifugal acceleration mainly happens close to the light cylinder , and since the power of a single particle curvature radiation behaves as @xmath93 , one has to check the constraint imposed by this mechanism on relativistic particle dynamics .",
    "a total power radiated by a single particle is given by @xmath94 where by @xmath95 we denote the curvature radius .",
    "then , the timescale of curvature emission can be defined by the following way : @xmath96 to find the limitation imposed on the maximum lorentz factor let us note that electrons initially accelerate efficiently , and this process lasts until the energy gain is balanced by the curvature losses .",
    "this happens when @xmath97 . by taking eqs .",
    "( [ tacc],[tcr ] ) into account and assuming @xmath98 , it is straightforward to show @xmath99 from eqs .",
    "( [ gmax],[gcr ] ) we see that for @xmath100 one has the following inequality @xmath101 .",
    "this indicates that the curvature radiation does not impose a significant limitation on the maximum attainable lorentz factors .",
    "therefore we conclude that maximum attainable kinetic energies are determined only by the ics .    as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ ener ] ) , the vhe emission ( @xmath102 ) detected by veritas can be achieved for the following interval of lorentz factors @xmath103 .",
    "equation ( [ gmax ] ) shows that when the inclination angles are in the following range @xmath104 , electrons attain lorentz factors from the aforementioned region of values ( see fig .",
    "[ gamma ] ) .",
    "@xmath105 , @xmath88 , @xmath106 and @xmath90 .    in fig .",
    "[ energy ] we show the behavior of the emission energy versus the inclination angle . as is clear from the figure , acceleration of electrons inside the region , @xmath107 , provides the photon energies from @xmath108 up to @xmath64 .    for finding the luminosity output above @xmath63 , we have to integrate eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) from @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "let us consider the following set of parameters : @xmath111 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath80 , then , the integration in eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) gets the vhe luminosity output of order @xmath112 . from eq .",
    "( [ lum ] ) we see that for @xmath113 , the observed vhe luminosity is in the range @xmath114 , therefore , our results are in a good agreement with the observed data .    for plotting our graphs and getting the results we used the parameters with the best fitting ,",
    "although the values from the following ranges are also applicable : @xmath115 $ ] , @xmath116 $ ] , @xmath117\\times 10^{-3}cm^{-3}$ ] , @xmath118 $ ] .    on the other hand , the high energy photons may undergo the @xmath119 absorbtion .",
    "it is well known that gamma rays interact most effectively with the background photons of energy @xcite @xmath120 and the corresponding cross section has a peak at @xmath121 .",
    "the optical depth of high energy photons , then becomes @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the mean - free path of infrared photons , @xmath124 is the corresponding photon density and @xmath125 - the infrared luminosity . after substituting eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ tau1 ] ) , one can derive an expression of the optical depth of high energy photons @xcite @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the eddington luminosity of 1es 0806 + 524 .    as we see from the figures , for producing radiation in the @xmath64 domain",
    ", one has to accelerate the electrons up to @xmath128 . for 1es",
    "0806 + 524 no infrared data are published so far , on the other hand , since the tev emission is detected , therefore the infrared luminosity of 1es 0806 + 524 must be less than @xmath129 ( see eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) ) .",
    "one has to note that the centrifugal acceleration leads to the tev variability timescale of the order @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that tev blazars exhibit the variability on hour to minute timescales , but this particular feature is not detected for 1es 0806 + 524 .",
    "as our investigation shows , the centrifugally accelerated outflows may provide the detected vhe emission of 1es 0806 + 524 via the ics if the parameters are chosen appropriately . from the aforementioned set of parameters very important one is the density of relativistic electrons , which has to be in the following interval @xmath131\\times 10^{-3}cm^{-3}$ ] in order for the centrifugal acceleration to explain the detected high energy emission .",
    "this we consider as a certain test to check if the mentioned mechanism is feasible .",
    "1 .   for explaining the observed tev energy radiation from 1es 0806 + 624 detected by veritas",
    ", we have considered the inverse compton scattering of disk thermal photons against centrifugally accelerated ultra - high energy electrons .",
    "we have shown that due to very strong magnetic field , the electrons are in the frozen - in condition , which leads to the co - rotation of particles . due to the co - rotation ,",
    "electrons centrifugally accelerate almost up to the light cylinder surface , and in the nearby zone of it the electrons upscatter against soft thermal photons , causing the limitation of particles kinetic energy .",
    "we also have shown that the role of the curvature radiation in limiting the maximum kinetic energy is negligible with respect to the inverse compton losses .",
    "we considered the @xmath119 absorbtion of high energy photons in the background field of soft infrared photons . from the observationally",
    "evident fact that the tev radiation escapes the central source , we estimated the maximum value of infrared luminosity which has not been detected so far .",
    "we have found that for physically reasonable parameters the ics occurs in the thomson regime .",
    "it has been shown that for the following interval of inclination angles , @xmath0 , with the best fitting parameters the resulting emission energies , ( @xmath102 ) and the luminosity output , @xmath132 are in a good agreement with the observed data .",
    "on the other hand , if the parameters are chosen in certain physically reasonable intervals , the high energy emission is also possible",
    ". therefore we offer the following test : if one indirectly measures the density of the relativistic electrons , and finds its value to be in the following range , @xmath131\\times 10^{-3}cm^{-3}$ ] , then the centrifugal acceleration is a feasible mechanism in producing the tev photons via the ics .    in the paper we have done several approximations .",
    "the first limitation is that we studied the straight magnetic field lines , although , especially in the very vicinity of the light cylinder the curvature of field lines becomes significant .",
    "therefore , the generalization of the present approach will be the next objective of our future work .",
    "the next approximation concerns the fact that according to our model magnetic field is not influenced by plasma kinematics . on the other hand , for real astrophysical scenarios ,",
    "it is obvious that plasmas may undergo the overall configuration of the magnetic field .",
    "for this reason , it is very important to generalize the approach presented here and see how the collective phenomena change the results .",
