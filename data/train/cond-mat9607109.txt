    "the remarkably rich phase diagram of magnetic flux lines in high@xmath0 superconductors , especially when subject to point and / or extended disorder , has attracted considerable experimental and theoretical interest ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the purpose of applying type  ii superconductors in external magnetic fields ,",
    "an effective vortex pinning mechanism is essential , in order to minimize dissipative losses caused by the lorentz  force induced movement of flux lines across the sample .",
    "this issue becomes even more important for the high@xmath0 superconductors , because the strongly enhanced thermal fluctuations in these materials render the abrikosov flux lattice unstable , and one therefore expects a first  order melting transition leading to a normal  conducting _ flux liquid _ phase with well below the upper critical field @xmath1 , at least for ideally pure systems @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult to pin such a vortex liquid consisting of fluctuating flexible lines by just intrinsic point disorder ( e.g. , oxygen vacancies ) ; yet asymptotically a truly superconducting low  temperature `` vortex glass '' phase has been predicted @xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to point defects , the influence of extended or _ correlated _ disorder , promising stronger pinning effects , on vortex transport properties has been considered . experimentally , linear damage tracks have been produced in oxide superconductors by irradiation with high  energy ions .",
    "these _ columnar defects _ serve as strong pinning centers for the flux lines , thus significantly increasing the critical current and shifting the irreversibility line upwards ( for references , see ref .",
    "@xcite , sec .  ix   b ) .    in a long  wavelength description in the spirit of the london approximation , one may consider the following model free energy for @xmath2 flux lines , defined by their trajectories @xmath3 as they traverse the sample , interacting with each other and with @xmath4 columnar defects which are aligned along the magnetic  field direction @xmath5 @xcite : @xmath6 +           \\sum_{k=1}^{n_{\\rm d } }           v_{\\rm d}[{\\vec r}_i(z ) - { \\vec r}_k ] \\biggr\\ } \\ .",
    "\\label{modelf}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denotes the repulsive vortex interaction ; the modified bessel function @xmath9 for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "thus the london penetration depth @xmath13 defines the interaction range and the energy scale @xmath14 . for low fields @xmath15 , i.e. : @xmath16 , the vortex line tension is @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the triangular lattice constant in the corresponding pure system ) .",
    "finally , the pinning energy is a sum of @xmath4 @xmath19independent potential wells @xmath20 with average spacing @xmath21 centered on the positions @xmath22 , whose diameters are typically @xmath23 , with a variation of @xmath24 , caused by the ion  beam dispersion .",
    "this induces some distribution @xmath25 of the pinning energies @xmath26 , which may be determined from the formula @xmath27 $ ] , where @xmath28 denotes the coherence length @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the model ( [ modelf ] ) are to be obtained by evaluation of the grand ",
    "canonical partition function @xmath29           \\ , \\e^{- f_n[\\ { { \\vec r}_i(z ) \\ } ] / k_{\\rm b } t } \\ , \\label{grpart}\\ ] ] with the chemical potential @xmath30 , which changes sign at the lower critical field @xmath31 .",
    "as for pure systems @xcite , one can map this statistical problem of directed flux lines interacting with columnar pins , onto the quantum mechanics of bosons in two dimensions subject to static point disorder via the identification of the vortex trajectories @xmath3 with the particle world lines in imaginary time @xcite . in table",
    "[ bosmap ] , the corresponding quantities for bosons and magnetic flux lines are listed ( notice that the thermodynamic limit @xmath32 for the directed polymers corresponds to a zero``temperature '' quantum problem ) , and the ensuing phase diagram is sketched schematically in fig .",
    "[ phadia ] . at high temperatures ,",
    "one thus finds an _ entangled liquid _ of unbound flux lines ( corresponding to a boson _ superfluid _ ) , separated by a sharp second  order transition ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) from a low  temperature phase of localized vortices .",
    "this _ bose glass _ phase is characterized by an infinite tilt modulus @xmath33 , and turns out to be stable over a certain range of tipping angles of @xmath34 away from the @xmath19 direction @xcite .",
    "at least for @xmath35 , the theory also suggests a low  temperature _ mott insulator _ phase , when @xmath36 , i.e. , the vortex density exactly matches that of the columnar pins .",
    "the bose glass and the mott insulator are distinct thermodynamic phases , for the latter should be characterized by infinite tilt _ and _ compressional moduli @xcite .",
    "lccccccccc bosons & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 + vortices & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 +    [ bosmap ]    the formal analogy with a boson superfluid can be further exploited to investigate the effect of disorder on density and current correlation functions in the flux liquid phase within the bogoliubov approximation @xcite .",
    "thus one may compute the corresponding transport coefficients , e.g. , the boson superfluid density @xmath43 whose flux line analog is the inverse tilt modulus of the vortex array ( see table  [ bosmap ] ) . for parallel columnar defects of strength @xmath55 one eventually finds @xcite : @xmath56 ,          \\ { \\rm with } \\",
    "t_{\\rm bg}(b ) \\approx t^ * [ \\phi_0 / ( 4 \\pi \\lambda)^2 b]^{1/4 } \\label{tilmod}\\ ] ] and @xmath57 , in accord with estimates obtained in the bose glass itself @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior at the boson localization transition is not yet fully understood , although quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite seem to support the scaling theory @xcite .",
    "direct simulations for the critical dynamics of flux lines near the bose glass transition have also been performed @xcite .",
    "recently , the positions of flux lines and parallel columnar pins , aligned along the magnetic  field direction , were simultaneously measured in a bscco sample in the bose glass phase at low magnetic fields using a combined chemical etching and magnetic decoration technique @xcite .",
    "figure  [ cdflpo ] depicts the thus obtained positions of @xmath4 columnar defects and @xmath2 flux lines in a two  dimensional cross section perpendicular to @xmath34 in a case where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "while the columnar defects are to a good approximation randomly distributed in space , the flux lines clearly form a highly _ correlated _ configuration ; correspondingly , the two  dimensional vortex structure function @xmath60 displays a distinct peak at wave vector @xmath61 , resembling an amorphous material ( see fig .",
    "[ strfac ] ) .",
    "this correlated structure must obviously be the result of the mutual repulsive interactions @xmath62 between the vortices which dominate over any statistical fluctuations in the pinning potentials @xmath63 ; on the other hand , all the flux lines are attached to a defect , and therefore @xmath64 @xcite .    in order to model this experimental situation , we can fortunately simplify the free energy ( [ modelf ] ) substantially : ( i ) as long as we limit ourselves to `` low '' temperatures ( an estimate for bscco actually yields @xmath65 ) we can neglect thermal wandering of the flux lines , which is furthermore significantly suppressed by the confining line defects , we may drop the tilt  energy @xmath66 and consider an effectively `` classical '' ( @xmath67 in the boson analogy ) two  dimensional system .",
    "( ii ) for magnetic fields smaller than the crossover field @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ phadia ] , the vortices are sufficiently dilute to ensure that their repulsive interactions have no influence on the localization length , and in fact the `` boson '' statistics becomes irrelevant ( for bscco , @xmath69 ) .",
    "having thus disposed of the entropic corrections , we may consider the following effective hamiltonian and its grand ",
    "canonical counterpart @xcite , @xmath70 where @xmath71 denote the defect sites , randomly distributed in the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane , @xmath74 is the corresponding site occupation number , and the @xmath75 are random  site energies ( originating in the varying pin diameters ) , whose distribution of mean zero and width @xmath76 we for simplicity choose to be flat : @xmath77 .",
    "this classical model is still far from trivial , however , due to the interplay of long  range interactions and disorder .",
    "fortunately models of the form ( [ effham ] ) , albeit with a coulomb potential replacing the screened logarithmic interaction @xmath40 , have been extensively studied in the context of disordered semiconductors , which allows us to adapt qualitative arguments and numerical simulation procedures from the literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "thus , in order to infer the ( approximate ) ground  state properties in the bose glass phase as functions of the filling @xmath78 and interaction range @xmath79 we employ a zero  temperature monte carlo algorithm that essentially minimizes the total energy ( [ effham ] ) with respect to all possible one  vortex transfers ; i.e. , the ground state stability is checked by demanding that all single  particle hops from occupied sites @xmath80 to empty sites @xmath81 _ require _ an energy @xmath82 , where @xmath83 are the _ interacting _ site energies . for @xmath84 and",
    "not too large @xmath85 the resulting distribution of flux lines among the columnar pins closely resembles the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ cdflpo ] .",
    "more quantitatively , we can investigate the amorphous peak at @xmath86 in the vortex structure factor @xmath87 , averaged over all directions in reciprocal space . whereas the dependence on the interaction range is rather weak as long as @xmath84 , the peak in fig .",
    "[ strfac ] vanishes when @xmath88 ; this reflects that at higher fillings the system has to increasingly accomodate with the underlying randomness , and therefore the correlations induced by the interactions disappear .",
    "furthermore , a triangulation of the vortex positions shows that typically only about 50 % of the sites are sixfold coordinated , and thus the structure formed by the flux lines rather resembles an amorphous state ( justifying the name `` bose glass '' ) rather than a weakly disordered triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "the above monte carlo algorithm can also be employed to determine the distribution of pinning energies @xmath89 , with the vortex interactions taken into account . as in the boson picture",
    "this is nothing but the single  particle density of states , @xmath89 is readily obtained by sampling the site energies @xmath90 for a number of disorder realizations and then performing a quenched average . following the mean  field arguments of efros and shklovskii ( 1984 ) for a system with long  range repulsive interactions @xmath91 , with @xmath92 ( here , the space dimension is @xmath93 ) , one expects that the density of states vanishes at the chemical potential according to a power law , @xmath94 with a _ gap exponent _ @xmath95 .",
    "this means that as a consequence of the correlations induced by the long  range interactions , the probability of finding a low  energy empty site ( @xmath96 ) for introducing an additional particle is greatly reduced , as is the density of states of high  energy filled sites ( @xmath97 ) for the corresponding process of removing a particle from the system .",
    "while the qualitative prediction ( [ gapexp ] ) remains correct , the actual gap exponent is influenced by subtle fluctuation effects @xcite and therefore differs from the mean  field predictions ( for the currently most accurate results for coulomb interactions , @xmath98 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ dosgap ] depicts two characteristic examples for the distribution of pinning energies @xmath89 , as obtained from our simulations @xcite , and normalized according to @xmath99 . in the case of an infinite  range logarithmic potential ,",
    "the ewald summation method was used , and before taking the limit @xmath100 , a term @xmath101 was subtracted from the site energies . the filled and empty states are separated by a wide soft gap centered at the chemical potential , with an effective gap exponent @xmath102 for low filling .",
    "remarkably , this characteristic double  peak structure and the marked depletion of states persists even for finite  range repulsion with @xmath103 ( fig .",
    "[ dosgap]b ) , and although @xmath104 does not strictly vanish any more , the distribution of pinning energies for @xmath105 can be fitted with a power law ( [ gapexp ] ) ; e.g. , @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 . upon increasing @xmath78 , the gap closes quickly due to the stronger influence of the underlying randomness ( compare fig .",
    "[ strfac ] ) , but for @xmath109 the correlation effects only disappear when @xmath110 .",
    "an in  plane current @xmath111 induces a lorentz force @xmath112 , acting on the vortices . accordingly , a term @xmath113 has to be added to the free energy ( [ modelf ] ) . in the spirit of the thermally assisted flux ",
    "flow ( taff ) model of vortex transport , we write the superconducting _ resistivity _",
    "( i.e. : the _ conductivity _ in the boson representation ) as @xmath114 $ ] , where @xmath115 is a characteristic flux  flow resistivity , and @xmath116 represents an effective barrier height .",
    "we shall see that in the bose glass phase @xmath117 actually diverges as @xmath118 , @xmath119 \\ .",
    "\\label{curvol}\\ ] ]    driven by an intermediate external current @xmath120 , a flux line will start to leave its columnar pin by detaching a segment of length @xmath19 into the defect ",
    "free region , thereby forming a half  loop of transverse size @xmath121 ( fig .",
    "[ sadcon]a ) .",
    "the free energy corresponding to this saddle  point configuration is readily estimated to be @xmath122 , and optimizing successively with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath121 one finds @xmath123 .",
    "hence the current  voltage characteristics assumes the form ( [ curvol ] ) , with @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and the effective _ transport exponent _ @xmath126 in the _ vortex half  loop regime _ @xcite . for @xmath127 ,",
    "the flux line will extend a double kink of width @xmath128 and energy @xmath129 to an adjacent columnar defect , and therefore for @xmath130 neighboring pins must be taken into account .",
    "thus , at low currents one enters another regime , where the flux line emits a pair of kinks to a possibly distant defect which happens to provide a favorable pinning energy ( fig .",
    "[ sadcon]b ) .",
    "this is the vortex analog of variable  range charge transport in disordered semiconductors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the cost in free energy for such a configuration of transverse size @xmath131 and extension @xmath132 along the magnetic  field direction will consist of the double  kink energy @xmath133 stemming from the elastic term , and the difference in pinning energies of the highest  energy occupied site , @xmath134 , and the empty site at distance @xmath131 with @xmath135 , where the distribution of pinning energies enters through the condition @xmath136 . minimizing the saddle  point free energy @xmath137 in the regime where @xmath89 has the form ( [ gapexp ] ) , one arrives at ( [ curvol ] ) with @xmath138 and the effective transport exponent @xcite @xmath139    for short  range interactions , @xmath140 , i.e. , @xmath141 , and the mott variable ",
    "range hopping exponent @xmath142 is recovered @xcite .",
    "but as the interaction range @xmath13 becomes larger than the average vortex separation @xmath143 , the emerging correlations reduce the phase space for single  vortex hopping drastically , and @xmath144 ; in addition , as the normalized distribution of pinning energies is broadened by the interactions , also the current scale @xmath145 in ( [ curvol ] ) is increased . the result of the minimization procedure using the numerical data for @xmath89 in the case @xmath108",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ ivchar ] as a function of the interaction range @xcite .",
    "assuming that flux line transport in the low  current regime is still dominated by single ",
    "vortex hops , this implies that long  range repulsive interactions reduce the resistivity by several orders of magnitudes with respect to the non  interacting situation .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath146 the exponent in ( [ curvol ] ) is about ten times smaller for @xmath147 as compared to @xmath148 ( see fig .",
    "[ ivchar ] ) , and hence @xmath149 is reduced by a factor of @xmath150 . in accord with the relation ( [ ivexpo ] ) , the effective transport exponent assumes values upto @xmath151 for @xmath152 and @xmath108 , while , e.g. , for @xmath107 and @xmath108 we find @xmath153 .",
    "we remark that the former value for for the variable  range hopping exponent of logarithmically interacting particles in two dimensions is consistent with an analysis based on the very different assertion that actually _ collective _ many  particle hops yield the lowest energy barriers @xcite .",
    "finally , a recent experiment on a bscco sample with @xmath154 and @xmath155 reported a measured @xmath156 in the variable  range hopping regime across about half a decade in the current  voltage characteristics @xcite ; this apparently agrees well with our results , although due caution needs to be applied for this comparison as in this experiment the magnetic field distribution was in fact very inhomogeneous .",
    "yet further experiments should clearly be capable to test the above predictions quantitatively .    in summary",
    ", experiments have established that columnar defects provide very effective pinning centers for flux lines in high@xmath157 superconductors , and demonstrated that in certain cases the repulsive vortex interactions lead to remarkable spatial correlations . as a consequence ,",
    "a soft `` coulomb gap '' emerges in the distribution of pinning energies , and vortex transport in the variable  range hopping regime should be drastically reduced .",
