    "accurate calculations of the hadron spectrum in lattice qcd require control of systematic errors .",
    "this has become a very important issue now that statistical errors have been reduced in recent years to the point where systematic errors can dominate the results reported .",
    "a major source of systematic error is that arising from the use of a space  time lattice with finite lattice spacing .",
    "all operators in the continuum lagrangian must be replaced with discrete versions and discretisation errors consequently appear .",
    "this means that physical results ( for example a mass in gev ) depend on the value of the lattice spacing .",
    "this is obviously wrong .",
    "since the lattice is simply a regulator for the theory , physical results must not depend upon its value .",
    "one approach has been to extrapolate to zero lattice spacing for a ` continuum ' result .",
    "this is difficult numerically , especially if the variation with lattice spacing is severe .",
    "however , recent progress in understanding discretisation errors and how to formulate an improved action @xcite , has meant that we can obtain essentially continuum results at finite values of the lattice spacing .",
    "the lattice spacing dependence is reduced to such a low level that extrapolation is unnecessary .",
    "the spectrum of bottomonium bound states is one of the most accurate calculations that can be done on the lattice @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath1 quarks are non - relativistic in these systems ( @xmath2 ) a non - relativistic action can be used @xcite .",
    "this allows a @xmath1 quark propagator to be calculated on one sweep through the gluon field configuration with low computational cost .",
    "multiple sources can be used on a single configuration because the bound states are much smaller than the volume of a typical lattice .",
    "also sources for both ground and excited states can be used , allowing multi - exponential fits to hadron correlators and improving the confidence in the fitted masses .",
    "these techniques mean that very small statistical errors can be obtained and the improvement of systematic errors becomes a priority . in this paper",
    "we discuss the issue of discretisation errors for the bottomonium spectrum @xcite .",
    "the approach that we use , non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite , is an effective field theory .",
    "its lagrangian is suited to a description of non - relativistic quarks since operators are classified according to the powers of @xmath3 they contain , where @xmath4 is the velocity of the heavy quark .",
    "the number of operators to be included can then be truncated at a fixed order in @xmath3 and this is clearly a sensible thing to do if @xmath5 .",
    "the renormalisability of qcd is lost in this process but physical results are still obtained by putting an explicit momentum cut - off into nrqcd . this cut - off should exclude relativistic momenta and thus be of the same order , or smaller , than the heavy quark mass . on the lattice",
    "this cut - off is provided by the lattice spacing , with @xmath6 .",
    "the excluded momenta cause renormalisation of the coefficients of the nrqcd operators when , say , lattice nrqcd is matched to full continuum qcd .",
    "the coefficients will be well - behaved and essentially cut - off independent provided that the cut - off is not too large . any attempt to take the cut - off to infinity ( lattice spacing to zero ) will cause them to diverge as the non - renormalisability of the theory becomes apparent .",
    "thus , no continuum extrapolation can be done for lattice nrqcd . however , as discussed above , a continuum extrapolation is not necessary for a suitably improved action .",
    "all that is necessary is to demonstrate lattice spacing independence of physical results .",
    "for the bottomonium spectrum from nrqcd this should be possible in a region of lattice spacing @xmath7 , and this is what we show in this paper .",
    "the size of discretisation errors will vary from one quantity to another .",
    "in general it is to be expected that the coefficient of the dependence on _ a _ should represent some typical momentum scale appropriate to that quantity @xcite . for the light hadron spectrum this would then be a few hundred mev . for heavy hadrons",
    "the scale of discretisation errors is likely to be larger .",
    "the scale is _ not _ set by the heavy quark mass since this is an irrelevant scale to the dynamics of the bound states .",
    "it is set rather by typical momenta exchanged inside the hadrons . for bottomonium these momenta",
    "are of order 1 gev and so discretisation errors might be expected to present a problem on coarse lattices if the action is not improved .",
    "here we report results with leading order ( @xmath8 ) discretisation errors removed from spin - independent terms , but not from the spin - dependent terms ( which are of lower order in the non - relativistic expansion ) .",
    "section 2 describes the lattice calculations and results at three different values of the lattice spacing .",
    "section 3 discusses the scaling behaviour of spin - independent and spin - dependent splittings .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "quark propagators in lattice nrqcd are determined , in a single pass through the gauge - field configuration , from evolution equations that specify the propagator for @xmath9 in terms of its value at @xmath10 .",
    "we use here : @xcite @xmath11 @xmath12 is the kinetic energy operator , the lowest order ( in @xmath3 ) term in the hamiltonian : @xmath13 the correction terms to the hamiltonian that we include in @xmath14 are @xmath15@xmath16 .",
    "they comprise relativistic corrections to the spin - independent @xmath12 as well as the first spin - dependent terms that give rise to spin - splittings in the spectrum .",
    "@xmath17 the last two terms in @xmath14 come from finite lattice spacing corrections to the lattice laplacian and the lattice time derivative respectively @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 is the symmetric lattice derivative and @xmath19 is a lattice version of the continuum operator @xmath20 .",
    "we used the standard traceless cloverleaf operators for the chromo - electric and magnetic fields , @xmath21 and  @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter  @xmath23 is introduced to remove instabilities in the heavy quark propagator caused by the highest momentum modes of the theory .",
    "we tadpole - improve @xcite our lattice action by dividing all the gauge fields , @xmath24 , that appear in @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the covariant lattice derivatives fields by @xmath27 , the fourth root of the plaquette .",
    "this is most easily done as the @xmath28 s are read by the code that evolves propagators .",
    "tadpole - improvement of the action allows us to work with tree - level values for the @xmath29 s in @xmath14 ( i.e. 1 ) without , we believe , having to worry about large renormalizations @xcite .",
    "hence our lattice action depends only on two parameters , the bare mass  @xmath30 and the qcd coupling constant ,  @xmath31 .",
    "table [ params ] shows the parameters used in the calculations at 3 different values of @xmath32 .",
    "the configurations were all generated using the standard unimproved wilson plaquette action and generously made available to us by the ukqcd collaboration @xcite and by kogut _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the results described here at @xmath32 = 6.0 agree with our previous results @xcite but generally have higher precision , because of an increased number of sources on different time slices and the increased length of the lattice in the time direction .    once the quark propagators have been calculated it is straightforward to obtain anti - quark propagators and meson correlation functions .",
    "we used the standard interpolating operators described in @xcite with source and sink ` smearing functions ' .",
    "we worked in coulomb gauge and took wavefunctions for smearing functions , either from a richardson potential ( @xmath32 = 6.0 and 6.2 ) or from a coulomb potential ( with modifications , @xmath32 = 5.7 ) .",
    "we took a ground state wavefunction and 2(1 ) radial excitations for s states at @xmath32 = 6.0 and 6.2 ( @xmath32 = 5.7 ) . for p states we used a ground state wavefunction and 1(0 ) radial excitations .",
    "we also used local sources and sinks which were delta functions for s states and combinations of delta functions for higher orbital excitations .",
    "in addition we looked at s - state mesons with small non - zero momenta . in the following discussion correlation functions at zero momentum will be denoted @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the source smearing function and @xmath1 the sink smearing function with @xmath35 for a delta function ( local operator ) , 1 for the ground state , 2 for the first excited state and so on .    at @xmath32 = 5.7",
    "we summed over both initial quark spins . at @xmath32 = 6.0 and 6.2",
    "we saved cpu time by fixing the initial quark spin to @xmath36 , since the spin - flip operators in the hamiltonian are suppressed with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "we then used the strong correlations between different polarisations to obtain reduced errors on the spin splittings for p states @xcite .",
    "we used 8 different spatial origins for our quark propagators at ( 2)(4)(1 ) different time slices at @xmath32 = ( 5.7)(6.0)(6.2 ) to improve statistics . at @xmath32 = 6.2",
    "all 8 spatial origins were handled simultaneously by using z(2 ) noise at each origin , 1 set per configuration @xcite .",
    "as described in @xcite we used multi - exponential fits to the multiple correlation functions obtained by different combinations of source and sink .",
    "this allowed us to obtain ground state energies and one or two excited state energies .",
    "two different types of fit were employed ; the ` matrix ' fit and the ` row ' fit .",
    "the matrix fit used the matrix of correlators obtained with ground and excited state sources and sinks .",
    "the row fit used the row of correlators with ground and excited state sources and local operator sinks .",
    "we found the correlators with both local source and sink to be of very little use in fitting .",
    "we had a large number of measurements in every case and so did not run into problems with our covariance matrix , even for multi - exponential fits with several parameters .",
    "the two different fits gave consistent results within the errors that we quote .",
    "final fitted values were chosen by monitoring the quality of the fits ( q ) for given ranges of fitting time , @xmath37 to @xmath38 , as well as the stability of the fitted parameters . for a given type of fit ,",
    "q generally increases sharply with @xmath37 until it reaches a plateau .",
    "the first fit for which this happens is taken as the preferred value .",
    "in general the @xmath23th excited energy is taken as reliable from a fit to @xmath39 exponentials .",
    "table [ fits ] shows the quality of our fitted results for a 2 exponential fit to 2 correlators for the @xmath40 ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 , at each @xmath32 value .",
    "notice how q increases from small values of @xmath37 as contamination from a third state dies away .",
    "notice also how stable the fitted ground state energies are for a very large range of @xmath37 values .",
    "it is interesting to study how the noise in the meson correlators changes with @xmath32 .",
    "we expect the ground state meson correlators ( @xmath43 ) to have noise governed by the same mass as the signal since it is the lightest mass available @xcite .",
    "this means that the errors in an effective mass plot will not grow with lattice time .",
    "figure 1 shows this clearly for the effective masses from the @xmath44 correlator .",
    "the size of the errors at different values of @xmath32 reflects partly the different statistics available for the different sets of configurations ( see table [ params ] ) .",
    "if we multiply the errors at @xmath32 of 5.7 by @xmath45 and at 6.0 by 2 , for the different number of time origins ( assuming these are independent ) , then the errors are in the ordering @xmath46 .",
    "the error depends on the overlap between the squared correlation function and two @xmath43 particles @xcite . on coarser lattices",
    ", the local sink will provide a better overlap with two @xmath43 particles than on finer lattices and so we would expect the error to be larger . if instead we compare correlation functions in which the ground state smearing is applied at both source and sink , @xmath47 , then the errors at all three values of @xmath32 are very similar when adjustments for statistics are made as above .",
    "this reflects the fact that the noise should not change if the physical overlap with two @xmath43 states does nt change .    for higher states than the ground state",
    "the noise grows exponentially with time according to the splitting between that state and the @xmath43 .",
    "figure [ pmeff ] shows this effect for the @xmath48 correlator with ground state smearing at the source and a local sink .",
    "we expect the doubling time for the error to be @xmath49 = 1.6 @xmath50 , and this is roughly true at all three values of @xmath32 .",
    "again the absolute size of the error at fixed physical time is very similar between all 3 @xmath32 values when adjustments for the different statistics are made as above .",
    "however , on the coarser lattice many fewer lattice time points occur before the noise grows overwhelmingly large",
    ".    table [ table_energies ] shows energies in dimensionless units obtained from our fits at each value of @xmath32 .",
    "3 exponential fits were used in general so the values for the @xmath51 states should be used with some caution .",
    "@xmath52 is the spin average of the @xmath53 states defined by @xmath54 this is obtained by measuring spin splittings ( see below ) between the @xmath55 states and the @xmath48 , and the energy of the @xmath48 .",
    "because the quark mass term is missing from our hamiltonian the zero of energy becomes shifted so that the energies measured in the simulation and given in table [ table_energies ] can not be directly converted to hadron masses .",
    "differences in energy can be converted directly to physical units using a value for the lattice spacing , but to obtain absolute masses we need to know the energy shift .",
    "it is sufficient to calculate an absolute mass for one meson only , and the one for which the most accurate calculation can be done and compared to experiment is the @xmath56 , the @xmath57 .    to calculate the absolute mass of the @xmath57 we measure the dispersion relation from the energy of meson correlation functions at small , non - zero momenta , and fit to a non - relativistic energy - momentum form : @xmath58 @xmath59 is the energy at zero momentum normally measured ( and given in table [ table_energies ] ) .",
    "@xmath60 is a constant to be obtained from the fit .",
    "@xmath61 is obtained accurately by a single exponential fit to the bootstrapped ratio of correlators at finite and zero momentum .",
    "we use the lowest 1 or 2 non - zero momenta in the fit .",
    "table [ table_energies ] shows the kinetic masses in lattice units , @xmath62 , obtained at the 3 different values for @xmath32 for the bare quark masses given in table [ params ] .",
    "the value at @xmath32 = 6.0 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and has not been recalculated on the kogut _",
    "et al _ configurations .",
    "p - wave spin splittings can also be obtained most accurately from ratio fits .",
    "single exponential fits are performed to the ratio of appropriate polarisation components to maximise the correlations , as discussed above .",
    "table [ table_energies ] shows the results for different splittings in lattice units at the 3 different values of @xmath32 .",
    "table [ psplits ] gives a more detailed breakdown for different polarisation components of the @xmath63 fine structure at @xmath32 = 6.0 and 6.2 .",
    "for a given splitting there is no significant difference between different polarisation components so we average to get a final value and allow for variations in the error .",
    "we see no significant difference between @xmath64 states and @xmath65 states .",
    "this has been checked explicitly by taking ratios of those correlators . for the hyperfine",
    "splitting ( @xmath66 ) we are able to extract both ground and excited splittings ( for the first time in a lattice calculation ) from simultaneous fits to the @xmath67 matrix of correlators for the @xmath43 and @xmath40 .",
    "these results are also given in table [ table_energies ] .",
    "the wavefunction at the origin is calculated from the ratio of amplitudes of row and matrix fits as described in ref .",
    "one of the useful features of the spectrum of heavy quark bound states is that the splittings between radial and orbital excitations , spin - averaged , are to a good approximation independent of quark mass in the region between bottom and charm .",
    "since not all the bottomonium fine structure has been seen experimentally , this statement relies to some extent on estimates of the spin splittings that have not been measured .",
    "however , since spin splittings are very small for bottomonium systems ( @xmath68 of spin - averaged splittings ) , we still expect little quark mass dependence for radial and orbital splittings in the region of @xmath69 when non - spin - averaged splittings are used .",
    "this allows us to set the scale from lattice calculations , independently of the requirement to tune the bare lattice quark mass to get the right kinetic mass for the @xmath57 .    in table",
    "[ scales ] we show values for the lattice spacing , obtained by fixing various radial and orbital splittings to experiment ( spin - averaging where possible ) , at the 3 different values of @xmath32 .",
    "these lattice spacing determinations are very accurate ones for setting the scale in the determination of @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "notice that different splittings at a given value of @xmath32 give slightly different values for @xmath71 .",
    "this is a feature of the quenched approximation which we return to below .",
    "first we describe how the determination of @xmath71 is done and how errors are assigned .    since the nrqcd action of eq .",
    "[ deltah ] is corrected through @xmath15@xmath72 for discretisation errors we would also like to remove other @xmath15@xmath72 errors that come from using gluon fields generated with the simple plaquette action .",
    "fortunately , these errors can be corrected for after the calculation .",
    "perturbatively the correction appears as a shift to energies and is related to the wavefunction at the origin .",
    "it can then be written in terms of the hyperfine splitting for @xmath73 states ( for @xmath74 states the shift is zero ) .",
    "we use @xcite @xmath75 with @xmath69 set to 5 gev . the resulting shift to the splittings of table  [ scales ]",
    "is given in column 4 .",
    "this shift is added to the splittings in lattice units before they are divided into the physical splitting to obtain @xmath71 . for the shift for 2s states we use the ratio of 2s to 1s hyperfines determined at @xmath32 = 6.0 and given in table  [ table_energies ] . the statistical error in the splitting",
    "is then inflated by @xmath76 before calculating the statistical error in @xmath71 given in column 5 .",
    "this determination of @xmath71 also has systematic errors , as in all lattice determinations .",
    "we attempt here to quantify the errors relevant to our calculation .",
    "there are two sources , physical and unphysical .",
    "the errors from higher order relativistic corrections which have been ignored are physical and will give the same percentage error at all values of the lattice spacing .",
    "the unphysical systematic errors come from higher order discretisation corrections that have not been included .",
    "these are all much larger at the coarsest lattice spacing than elsewhere .    as a guide to estimating the size of these errors we have estimated , using a potential model @xcite , the size of the shifts in energy caused by the relativistic and discretisation corrections of @xmath14 that we _ have _ included and compared those to the results of nrqcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the potential model estimates for the sum of relativistic and discretisation corrections in @xmath14 at @xmath32 = 6.0 give a resulting shift to the @xmath0 @xmath77 splitting of @xmath78 mev , made up of @xmath78 mev from the relativistic corrections ( 10 mev from the @xmath79 term and @xmath80 mev from the @xmath81 term ) and cancelling contributions each of around 10 mev in magnitude from the two discretisation corrections @xcite .",
    "the @xmath82 splitting has smaller shifts because the expectation values on which the shifts depend are more similar for the @xmath83 and @xmath84 than the @xmath63 and @xmath84 .",
    "the expected result from adding all the terms is still @xmath78 mev .",
    "the nrqcd results show a @xmath77 splitting that is 20(30 ) mev larger without @xmath14 than with , and a @xmath82 splitting that is 5(25 ) mev larger .",
    "this is in good agreement with expectations , albeit with statistical errors that are too large to show a clear effect .",
    "however , if the shifts had been much larger than the estimates , they would have been visible above the noise .    from this result",
    "we can extrapolate to the size of relativistic and discretisation corrections that we have not included .",
    "the terms that we can estimate most readily are those involving powers of quark momenta since these are easy to relate to lower order terms .",
    "the terms involving chromo - electric and magnetic fields and those terms with a structure that appears for the first time at higher order are much harder and we have not estimated these .",
    "there is no reason , however , to suppose from our study above ( which compares the @xmath79 and darwin terms ) , that these terms should be any larger than the ones we can easily estimate .",
    "higher order relativistic corrections would appear as @xmath85 terms in @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15@xmath86 relative to the leading terms .",
    "the percentage error we expect is then navely @xmath87 . on the other hand , the estimates above using potential models @xcite , of the @xmath88 spin - independent relativistic corrections that we _ have _ included show them each to be less than half of the 10% (= 50 mev ) navely expected .",
    "in addition we actually need the difference between the corrections for , say @xmath63 and @xmath84 , to get the shift in the splitting .",
    "this indicates that higher order corrections could be smaller than 1% too .",
    "another type of similar higher order correction is that from radiative corrections to the @xmath29 coefficients beyond tadpole - improvement .",
    "these should appear at the level of @xmath70 at an ultra - violet scale times the @xmath88 relativistic corrections , giving 0.5% at @xmath32 = 5.7 and less at higher @xmath32 values .",
    "to encompass both these higher order physical corrections a 1% error is given as the second error in column 5 of table  [ scales ] .    the nrqcd action , eq .",
    "[ deltah ] , includes the leading @xmath34 and @xmath8 corrections which appear in power counting form as @xmath89 and @xmath90 relative to the leading order @xmath91 term ( @xmath12 ) . @xmath74 and @xmath92 are a typical momentum and kinetic energy associated with the bound state .",
    "estimates of these terms using potential models @xcite yield shifts of 40 mev at @xmath32 = 5.7 , 10 mev at @xmath32 = 6.0 and 5 mev at @xmath32 = 6.2 , in the @xmath77 splitting .",
    "higher order discretisation errors not included could be radiative corrections to those included ( beyond the tadpole - improvement of these terms which has been done ) and we can estimate these as @xmath93 @xcite times the leading errors .",
    "this gives 7 mev at @xmath32 = 5.7 , 1.5 mev at @xmath32 = 6.0 and 0.7 mev at @xmath32 = 6.2 .",
    "higher order terms in @xmath34 ( such as @xmath94 terms ) would give a percentage effect roughly the square of the leading order terms , i.e 4 mev at @xmath32 = 5.7 , 0.2 mev at @xmath32 = 6.0 and essentially 0 at @xmath32 = 6.2 .",
    "we should also consider the first discretisation corrections to the first relativistic corrections i.e. terms of order @xmath95 .",
    "these are very similar looking terms to the @xmath94 terms and so we can use this to estimate their size .",
    "including powers of @xmath96 and numerical factors we get a similar size correction at @xmath32 = 5.7 . at higher values of @xmath32 these corrections",
    "are actually more important than those which are higher order in @xmath34 but not suppressed by powers of @xmath91 .",
    "however , all discretisation corrections become smaller at higher @xmath32 so they are still negligible ; 0.5 mev at @xmath32 = 6.0 and @xmath97 at @xmath32 = 6.2 . the third error given in column 5 of table  [ scales ] is then conservatively estimated by the sum of the three errors given above from discretisation errors in the nrqcd action . it is interesting to note that the discretisation corrections are smaller than the anticipated higher order relativistic corrections except at @xmath32 = 5.7 .",
    "note also that the statistical errors are generally larger than the systematic - to see any effect from including higher order terms we would have to improve our statistical error significantly .",
    "higher order discretisation corrections from the gluon action are anticipated to be negligible given the size of the @xmath15@xmath72 correction in table  [ scales ] .",
    "the @xmath71 determination at @xmath32 = 6.0 agrees with our previous determination @xcite and at @xmath32 = 6.2 agrees with previous ukqcd results @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , experimental spin - averaged radial and orbital splittings are very insensitive to the value of the quark mass .",
    "however , in the quenched approximation there is some mass dependence for these splittings on the lattice @xcite , and this is increased if spin - averaging is not done .",
    "it is therefore true that a tuned bare quark mass is necessary to get the right radial and orbital splittings .",
    "the spin splittings are much more sensitive to the quark mass ( roughly as its inverse ) , and it is essential to tune the quark mass to get these correct .",
    "the way in which we tune the quark mass is to adjust it until the kinetic mass of the @xmath57 agrees with experiment .",
    "table  [ kmass ] shows the kinetic mass of the @xmath57 ( given in lattice units in table  [ table_energies ] ) in gev , for each of the 3 values of @xmath32 , using @xmath71 from table  [ scales ] .",
    "there is reasonable agreement with the experimental result 9.46 gev in each case , provided that the value for @xmath71 is taken from the @xmath98 splitting .",
    "the systematic errors in the determination of @xmath99 are at the 1% level from the same sources as systematic errors in the determination of @xmath71 .",
    "this is smaller in every case than the statistical error , dominated by the statistical uncertainty in @xmath71 .",
    "the difference between the kinetic mass of a meson and its energy at zero momentum is calculable in perturbation theory @xcite .",

    "the perturbative error is at @xmath15@xmath105 and is taken here as the square of the @xmath15@xmath106 term .",
    "note that the relationship in eq .",
    "[ shift ] is well defined perturbatively .",
    "non - perturbative values for the shift between @xmath59 and @xmath100 can also be measured on the lattice for , say , @xmath57 and used , divided by 2 , for @xmath107 physics @xcite .",

    "we can investigate the scaling of spin - averaged splittings across the range of @xmath32 values we have used .",

    "the @xmath109 mass was calculated using an action with @xmath15@xmath110 errors removed using a clover term with tadpole - improved coefficient ; i.e. a similar philosophy to that used here to remove discretisation errors from the @xmath57 splittings .",
    "the remaining errors in the @xmath109 determination may then be of @xmath15@xmath72 .",
    "for the @xmath111 splitting we have removed the @xmath15@xmath72 gluonic errors so , as discussed earlier , the remaining errors are higher order in @xmath34 and/or suppressed by powers of @xmath91 .",
    "the plot is very flat showing that good scaling is obtained .",
    "we can rule out scaling violations in this ratio with a scale larger than a few hundred mev , and it would be very unlikely for the @xmath109 mass and the @xmath57 system to have identical and cancelling large scaling violations .",
    "the plot also shows in the comparison to the gf11 results , that if an unimproved calculation is done of the @xmath109 mass @xcite , an absence of scaling is quite evident ( in this case linear in @xmath34 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath112 shows a big discrepancy with experiment .",
    "this we believe is an error from the quenched approximation .",
    "the scales intrinsic to a light hadron system and the @xmath57 are quite different and the coupling constant does not run correctly between these scales in the quenched approximation .",
    "again , these errors are masked by discretisation errors for an unimproved light hadron spectrum .",
    "figure  [ upsrho ] also shows the ratio of the @xmath108 splitting to the @xmath113 parameter of qcd in the v scheme @xcite .",
    "again good scaling is seen over this limited range of lattice spacings .",
    "figure  [ siratios ] shows the dimensionless ratios of various splittings within the @xmath57 system ( spin - averaged where possible ) as a function of lattice spacing .",
    "the ratios shown are for the @xmath114 , @xmath115 and the @xmath116 ( experiment for the latter case using @xmath117 for @xmath118 ) .",
    "the ratios are constant as a function of lattice spacing , although the statistical errors are rather large for the 3s and 2p cases .",
    "this means that we can interpret our results as continuum results .",
    "note that our current value for the energy of the @xmath119 at @xmath32 = 6.0 has dropped by @xmath120 from our previous calculation @xcite with slightly smaller statistical errors .",
    "our @xmath121 energy has not changed and the error has fallen by a factor of 2 .",
    "our best value for the ratio @xmath122 is now 1.35(6 ) and the discrepancy with experiment remains @xmath123 , controlled by the uncertainty in the @xmath119 energy .",
    "the discrepancy with experiment for the ratios involving the 3s and 2p could be affected by finite volume errors as well as quenching errors .",
    "spin splittings in lattice units are given in table  [ table_energies ] .",
    "this includes , for the first time , the radially excited hyperfine splittings , @xmath124 and @xmath125 at @xmath32 = 6.0 where our results are most precise .",
    "no hyperfine splitting has yet been seen experimentally for the @xmath57 system , and a radially excited hyperfine splitting is still awaited for charmonioum .",
    "we find the 2s hyperfine splitting to be about half that of the ground state here .",
    "a proper analysis however , has to study the lattice spacing dependence and the effect of unquenching on this ratio .    in this section",
    "we investigate the dependence in physical units of the ground state spin splittings on the lattice spacing .",
    "we also compare to recent ukqcd results @xcite in which a systematic study at next order in relativistic and discretisation corrections has been done for spin - dependent terms , i.e. those which affect the spin splittings , only . by comparing the scaling of our results with their results we can untangle to some extent the difference between the discretisation errors at fixed @xmath34 , which are unphysical , and the relativistic corrections , which are physical . whether or not the spin - dependent relativistic corrections ( i.e. terms of @xmath15@xmath126 )",
    "are sizeable or not is important since these are terms outside the scope of potential models .    to investigate scaling",
    "we show in figures  [ hyprat ] and  [ prat ] various spin splittings in mev setting the scale from the @xmath98 splitting as a function of @xmath8 . the @xmath98 splitting is used since this is the one for which our quark masses are closest to being tuned and this is important for spin splittings @xcite .",
    "the results from table  [ table_energies ] are given as squares .",
    "we include in the figures the direct uncertainty in the spin splittings from statistical errors in the lattice spacing .",
    "there is an additional error , which we have not included , from the uncertainty in the kinetic mass from the error in the lattice spacing .",
    "this uncertainty leads to an uncertainty in the tuned quark mass which affects the spin splittings .",
    "if the spin splittings vary as the inverse quark mass ( roughly true at least for the hyperfine splitting ) , then this second uncertainty is actually equal in size , correlated with and in the same direction as the error that we have included .",
    "this would lead to an approximate doubling of the error bars in the figures .",
    "clear dependence on the lattice spacing is visible for the hyperfine splitting , @xmath66 . for the @xmath63 fine structure",
    "it is less clear because statistical errors , particularly at @xmath32 = 6.2 , are so much higher .",
    "lattice spacing dependence in our results is not surprising since the hamiltonian we have used has only leading order spin - dependent terms with no corrections for discretisation errors in these terms .",
    "these errors are expected to be @xmath15@xmath72 relative to the leading term and therefore in relative terms significantly larger than for our spin - independent splittings .",
    "in addition , in a potential model picture the fine structure is provided by potentials which are generally of much shorter range than the central potential so we would expect the fine structure to have a harder scale for discretisation errors than the radial and orbital splittings . if we parameterize the scaling violations in the hyperfine splitting by @xcite : @xmath127 we find the parameter @xmath128 to take a value around 0.8 gev for the squares .    for the @xmath63 fine structure",
    "we have the advantage that we can compare to experimental results as well as comparing results at different values of the lattice spacing . in figure  [ prat ]",
    "we notice a clear disagreement with experiment for the squares in that both the overall scale of splittings is too small and the ratio @xmath129 is too large .",
    "similar results were noticed in our charmonium spectrum calculation @xcite .",
    "the disagreement with experiment over @xmath109 was suggested there as a discretisation effect and results here tend to confirm that discretisation errors do have an effect in this ratio .",
    "our value for @xmath109 at beta=5.7 is 1.4(3 ) and at 6.0 , 1.1(3 ) .",
    "the experimental value is 0.66 .",
    "the comparison between the squares at @xmath32 = 5.7 and 6.0 shows that scaling violations are just about visible for the @xmath130 and @xmath131 above the statistical errors .",
    "the slope of the scaling violations is similar to that for the hyperfine splitting ( but with large errors ) .",
    "also in agreement with the hyperfine splitting we can see that adding discretisation corrections would increase the splittings and this would make the 1p fine structure closer to experiment .    on figures  [ hyprat ] and  [ prat ]",
    "we also show results from manke _ et al _ @xcite at @xmath32 = 6.0 and 5.7 with diamonds .",
    "they have used the same bare quark masses as us at both values of @xmath32 but included higher order spin - dependent relativistic ( @xmath15@xmath132 ) and discretisation ( @xmath15@xmath133 ) corrections to the action @xcite , all tadpole - improved with @xmath27 .",
    "we take their spin splittings in lattice units and convert to physical units using our @xmath98 splitting since , as explained earlier , this is the @xmath71 for which the quark masses are best tuned . our result for this splitting should be the same as theirs since they have added only spin - dependent terms @xcite and ours is more precise .",
    "the lattice spacing dependence of their results should be much reduced over ours , and we see that it is . by comparing their results and ours , we can see that the relativistic corrections act in the opposite direction to the discretisation corrections , in agreement with the findings of @xcite .    by comparing the results of @xcite with ours we can attempt to untangle the size of @xmath85 relativistic corrections to the fine structure .",
    "first , however , we should also include radiative corrections to the leading order terms , beyond tadpole improvement .",
    "these are of @xmath15@xmath134 and therefore of a similar size to the relativistic @xmath85 corrections .",
    "the @xmath29 in equation 3 take the form @xmath135 with @xmath136 of @xmath15@xmath137 .",
    "preliminary perturbative results are available @xcite for @xmath138 , for the @xmath139 term in the action , and confirm this expectation . in perturbation theory the hyperfine splitting then picks up a factor of the square of this correction , so it is quite sensitive to @xmath138 .",
    "figure  [ hyprat ] shows with fancy squares our results for the hyperfine splitting rescaled by @xmath140 .",
    "values for @xmath141 were taken from @xcite .",
    "@xmath138 increases as @xmath96 increases , which gives a larger correction at low @xmath32 . since this is also the direction in which @xmath142 increases the correction at @xmath32 = 5.7 is large , 50% . at @xmath32 = 6.2",
    "the correction from @xmath138 is 20% @xcite .",
    "the fancy diamonds show the rescaled results from @xcite in which we have simply rescaled the leading order piece i.e. we have applied the same shift in mev to these results as to ours .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the radiative corrections act in the same direction as discretisation corrections discussed earlier and absorb some of them , softening the value of @xmath128 in equation  [ scaling ] .    for the hyperfine splitting",
    ", we will assume that the discretisation corrections at @xmath32 = 6.0 in the @xmath143 action @xcite are of @xmath15@xmath144 and therefore negligible already at @xmath32 = 6.0 .",
    "for the @xmath86 action ( this work ) we will take the result at @xmath32 = 6.2 as being the least affected by discretisation errors ( we do nt expect more than a 5% effect here ) .",
    "the difference then between the result in physical units between @xmath32 = 6.2 ( @xmath88 ) and @xmath32 = 6.0 ( @xmath145 ) represents the effect of relativistic corrections . from figure  [ hyprat ] with fancy squares and diamonds",
    "this gives a 15% decrease in the hyperfine splitting and from the plain squares and diamonds a 20% decrease , consistent with the expectation of around 10% from power counting in @xmath3 .    for the @xmath74 fine structure ,",
    "the radiative corrections are not available and they would in any case be much harder to apply without doing the full lattice calculation including them .",
    "we therefore just compare the results with ( diamonds ) and without ( squares ) the @xmath85 and @xmath146 corrections in figure  [ prat ] .",
    "the lattice spacing dependence is apparently reduced by the @xmath146 corrections , although the statistical errors make it hard to quantify this result .",
    "the relativistic corrections again act to reduce the splittings , now to something like 50% of experiment .",
    "the size of the relativistic corrections is significant , possibly several times the nave estimate of 10% .",
    "they could be offset by radiative corrections , however , in a fully consistent calculation that includes the next order in @xmath91 , @xmath8 and @xmath147 over our calculation .",
    "radiative corrections which increase the spin splittings , as for the hyperfine case , would improve the agreement with experiment , but unless these are surprisingly large , the splittings will remain too small in the quenched approximation .",
    "initial unquenched results for the @xmath88 action @xcite and the @xmath148 action @xcite have indicated an increase in the @xmath74 spin splittings , but currently statistical errors are too large to clearly determine the size of unquenching effects .    ref .",
    "@xcite points out that the @xmath143 action has a much improved value of @xmath109 ( eq .  [ rho ] ) over the @xmath86 action .",
    "they quote 0.56(19 ) at @xmath32 = 6.0 in the quenched approximation , now in agreement with experiment , confirming the discretisation effects for this ratio discussed above .",
    "in fact , we do not expect this ratio to agree exactly with experiment in the quenched approximation .",
    "an analysis of @xmath109 for the simple cornell potential @xcite shows that for a quenched @xmath70 which is too small , the value of @xmath109 is reduced . with better statistics it may become clear that the quenched value for @xmath109 is actually smaller than the experimental result .    another way to study the sensitivity of the fine structure to higher order terms in the action is to change the value of the tadpole coefficient , @xmath149 .",
    "several calculations @xcite have indicated that the average link in landau gauge , @xmath150 is to be preferred over the fourth root of the plaquette , @xmath27 , that we have used here .",
    "changing @xmath149 is equivalent to resumming various terms to all orders in the @xmath29 .",
    "it is again easy to rescale the hyperfine splitting after the simulation to account for a different value of @xmath149 , by counting the powers of @xmath149 that appear in front of the @xmath139 term .",
    "the hyperfine splitting is very sensitive to @xmath149 , scaling as @xmath151 , when allowing for @xmath149 factors in @xmath12 which change the renormalised quark mass .",
    "the expected scaling is confirmed by calculations at different values of @xmath149 @xcite ( although here a fixed bare quark mass was used ) .",
    "the hyperfine splitting increases most on using @xmath150 at @xmath32 = 5.7 .",
    "there the ratio of @xmath152 is 1.045 ; at @xmath32 = 6.0 it is 1.020 and at @xmath32 = 6.2 , 1.013 @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine splitting with @xmath150 then has somewhat reduced lattice spacing dependence .",
    "note that @xmath153 will be different for the action with @xmath150 , since a different amount of the radiative correction has been absorbed by the tadpole factors .",
    "@xmath138 in fact is larger , by 0.24 , being the cube of the ratio of the @xmath149 factors to @xmath15@xmath154 .",
    "the size of relativistic and discretisation corrections will change by differing amounts on changing @xmath149 because they have different effective powers of @xmath149 in their coefficients .    from the above we",
    "can conclude that systematic errors in the fine structure still exceed 10% , even in the quenched approximation . to improve the accuracy",
    "the @xmath85 and @xmath146 action must be used , with radiative corrections included for the leading spin - dependent terms . for the hyperfine splitting the sensitivity to the @xmath29",
    "is such that the @xmath15@xmath155 term also needs to be known ( or at least bounded ) .",
    "the determination of the @xmath29 is in progress @xcite .",
    "more accurate meson kinetic masses and lattice spacing determinations are also required so that the quark mass can be tuned more accurately , since the spin splittings are sensitive to this .",
    "the wavefunction at the origin is another short distance quantity but one which does not vanish as the spin - dependent terms are switched off . in figure  [ wave ]",
    "we show results for @xmath156 for the @xmath57 and @xmath157 as a function of @xmath8 , again setting the scale from the @xmath158 splitting since the wave function is sensitive to quark mass",
    ". the lattice spacing dependence does not seem severe but the statistical errors are large .",
    "they are dominated by those from @xmath71 which here is raised to the 3/2 power .",
    "the bursts show experimental values based on the leptonic widths and the nave van royen - weisskopf formula , @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the vector meson mass . there will be radiative corrections to this formula of @xmath15@xmath106 . for potential model wavefunctions these radiative corrections have coefficient @xmath161 but this does not have to be the same for nrqcd .",
    "calculations of the renormalisation factors have only been done for lower order actions than the one used here @xcite .",
    "there will also be terms of @xmath15@xmath162 from mixing of the vector current with higher dimension operators ( in a similar way to the mixing for @xmath163 which has been worked out in some detail @xcite ) .",
    "a lot of the radiative corrections cancel in the ratio of leptonic widths for the @xmath84 and @xmath83 states .",
    "experimentally this ratio is 2.5(2 ) .",
    "our result at @xmath32 = 6.0 simply from the ratio of @xmath164 is 1.7(4 ) .",
    "we expect errors in the quenched approximation which would suppress the 1s wavefunction at the origin relative to the 2s , so that it is not surprising that our result is somewhat smaller than experiment .",
    "we can not yet say whether the reduction observed is reasonable .    to obtain results for the real world from simulations in the quenched approximation and at 2 flavours of dynamical quarks , extrapolations in @xmath165",
    "(= the number of flavours of dynamical quarks ) will be required . for this",
    "it is important to have scaling quantities , as we have discussed here .",
    "it is also necessary to use quantities which are sensitive to the same number of dynamical fermions .",
    "this means that for a given splitting we should set the scale using a quantity which has similar internal momentum scales .",
    "for example , for the fine structure it may not be optimal to use the softer radial and orbital splittings to set the scale .",
    "typical momentum scales for radial and orbital splittings are around 1 gev so they can be expected to ` see ' 3 flavours of dynamical fermions in the real world @xcite .",
    "the fine structure may instead ` see ' 4 flavors and this would imply that an extrapolation in @xmath165 can only be done in terms of a quantity which also sees 4 flavors .    in figure  [ hypp ]",
    "we show a plot of the hyperfine splitting in mev against the square of the lattice spacing using the @xmath166 splitting to set the scale .",
    "statistical errors are now very large , despite using the most accurate of the @xmath167 fine structure splittings . much higher accuracy will be needed to use this ratio for @xmath165 extrapolations .",
    "we have calculated the spectrum of bottomonium bound states at 3 different values of the lattice spacing using nrqcd in the quenched approximation . ratios of spin - independent splittings are constant in this region , independent of the lattice spacing .",
    "this is a necessary requirement for the results to make physical sense .",
    "there is no necessity to extrapolate to vanishing lattice spacing ( impossible anyway for nrqcd ) .",
    "the constancy of the results implies that they can now be used in extrapolations to real - world @xmath165 values when combined with results on dynamical configurations @xcite .    for spin - dependent splittings there is some visible ( unphysical ) lattice spacing dependence",
    "this is not surprising since our spin splittings are only accurate to leading order , given the terms in the hamiltonian that we have used .",
    "a comparison to a calculation @xcite which does include higher order relativistic and discretisation corrections to spin - dependent terms shows that the relativistic spin - dependent corrections could be as large as 20% for the hyperfine splitting where they can be quantified .",
    "they act to reduce spin - dependent splittings in all cases , and this increases the disagreement with experiment for the @xmath167 fine structure in the quenched approximation .    for extrapolations to real world values of @xmath165 we may need to employ different techniques for fine structure to that for radial and orbital splittings since different momentum scales are involved and this may lead to a different number of dynamical flavors being ` seen ' .",
    "statistical errors are currently too high to use a @xmath167 spin splitting to set the scale in such a programme .",
