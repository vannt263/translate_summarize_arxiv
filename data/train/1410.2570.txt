    "the events of the last several years revealed an acute need for tools to systematically model , analyze , monitor , and control large financial networks .",
    "motivated by this need , we propose to address the problem of optimizing the amount and structure of liquidity assistance in a distressed financial network , under a variety of modeling assumptions and implementation scenarios .",
    "two broad applications motivate our work : day - to - day monitoring of financial systems and decision making during an imminent crisis .",
    "examples of the latter include the decision in september 1998 by a group of financial institutions to rescue long - term capital management , and the decisions by the treasury and the fed in september 2008 to rescue aig and to let lehman brothers fail .",
    "the deliberations leading to these and other similar actions have been extensively covered in the press .",
    "these reports suggest that the decision making processes could have benefited from quantitative methods for analyzing potential policies and their likely outcomes .",
    "in addition , such methods could help avoid systemic crises in the first place , by informing day - to - day actions of financial institutions , regulators , supervisory authorities , and legislative bodies .    given a financial network model , we are interested in addressing the following problem .    1",
    ".   * problem i : * allocate a fixed amount of cash assistance among the nodes in a financial network in order to minimize the ( possibly weighted ) sum of unpaid liabilities in the system .",
    "an alternative , lagrangian , formulation of the same problem , is to both select the amount of injected cash and determine how to distribute it among the nodes in order to minimize the overall cost equal to a linear combination of the weighted sum of unpaid liabilities and the amount of injected cash .",
    "we consider a static model with a single maturity date , and with a known network structure . at",
    "first , we assume that we know both the amounts owed by every node in the network to every other node , and the net asset amounts available to every node from sources external to the network .",
    "even for this relatively simple model , problem  i is far from straightforward , because of a nonlinear relationship between the cash injection amounts and the loan repayment amounts .",
    "building upon the results from  @xcite , we construct algorithms for computing exact solutions for problem  i and its lagrangian variant , by showing in section  [ sec : lp ] that both formulations are equivalent to linear programs under the payment scheme assumed in  @xcite .    because of this equivalence to linear programs",
    ", these problems can be solved for any network topology by any standard lp solver . in some scenarios , however , this approach may be impractical or undesirable , as it requires the solver to know the entire network structure , namely , the net external assets of every institution , as well as the amount owed by each institution to each other institution . in section  [ sec : da ] , we adapt our framework to avoid centralized data gathering and computation .",
    "we propose a distributed algorithm to solve our linear program .",
    "while the algorithm is slower than standard centralized lp solvers , simulations suggest its practicality for the us banking system .",
    "some applications , such as stress testing , require forecasting and planning for a wide variety of different contingencies .",
    "such applications call for the use of stochastic models for the nodes external asset values . in this case",
    ", we aim to solve a stochastic version of problem  i.    1 .",
    "* problem i - stochastic : * allocate a fixed amount of cash assistance among the nodes in a financial network in order to minimize the expectation of the ( possibly weighted ) sum of unpaid liabilities in the system .",
    "we prove in section  [ sec : random - e ] that , under the payment scheme assumed in  @xcite  whereby each defaulting bank uses all its available funds to pay all its creditors in proportion to the amounts it owes them  this problem is equivalent to a stochastic linear program . to solve this problem",
    "we develop two algorithms based on monte carlo sampling : a benders decomposition algorithm described in section  [ subsec : benders ] and a projected stochastic gradient descent algorithm described in section  [ subsec : stochastic - gd ] .",
    "both algorithms are centralized ( non - distributed ) and assume that we are able to efficiently obtain independent samples of the external asset vector .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : linear_bankruptcy_costs ] that under the all - or - nothing payment scheme where the defaulting nodes do not pay at all , problem i is an np - hard mixed - integer linear program . however , we show through simulations that use optimization package cvx  @xcite that this problem can be accurately solved in a few seconds on a personal computer for a network size comparable to the size of the us banking network .",
    "we also consider another problem where the objective is to minimize the number of defaulting nodes rather than the weighted sum of unpaid liabilities :    1 .",
    "* problem ii : * allocate a fixed amount of cash assistance among the nodes in a financial network in order to minimize the number of nodes in default .    for problem",
    "ii , we develop two heuristic algorithms : a reweighted @xmath0 minimization approach inspired by  @xcite and a greedy algorithm .",
    "we illustrate our algorithms using examples with synthetic data for which the optimal solution can be calculated exactly .",
    "we show through numerical simulations that the solutions calculated by the reweighted @xmath0 algorithm are close to optimal , and the performance of the greedy algorithm highly depends on the network topology .",
    "we also compare these two algorithms using three types of random networks for which the optimal solution is not available . in one of these three examples the performance of these two algorithms",
    "is statistically indistinguishable ; in the second example the greedy algorithm outperforms the reweighted @xmath0 algorithm ; and in the third example the reweighted algorithm outperforms the greedy algorithm .",
    "while problem  ii is unlikely to be of direct practical importance ( indeed , it is difficult to imagine a situation where a regulator would consider the failures of a small local bank and citi to be equally bad ) , it serves as a stepping stone to a more practical and more difficult scenario where the optimization objective is a linear combination of the weighted unpaid liabilities ( as in problem  i ) and the sum of weights over the defaulted nodes ( an extension of problem  ii ) .    1",
    ".   * problem iii : * given a fixed amount of cash to be injected into the system , we consider an objective function which is a linear combination of the sum of weights over the defaulted nodes and the weighted sum of unpaid liabilities .",
    "we show that this problem is equivalent to a mixed - integer linear program .",
    "contagion in financial networks has been frequently studied in the past , especially after the financial crisis in 2007 - 2008 .",
    "notable examples of network topology analysis based on real data are  @xcite .",
    "real data informs the new approaches for assessing systemic financial stability of banking systems developed in  @xcite .",
    "often , systemic failures are caused by an epidemic of defaults whereby a group of nodes unable to meet their obligations trigger the insolvency of their lenders , leading to the defaults of lenders lenders , etc , until this spread of defaults infects a large part of the system .",
    "for this reason , many studies have been devoted to discovering network structures conducive to default contagion  @xcite .",
    "the relationships between the probability of a systemic failure and the average connectivity in the network are investigated in  @xcite .",
    "other features , such as as the distribution of degrees and the structure of the subgraphs of contagious links , are examined in  @xcite .",
    "while potentially useful in policymaking , most of these references do not provide specific policy recipes .",
    "one strand of literature on quantitative models for optimizing policy decisions has focused on analyzing the efficacy of bailouts and understanding the behavior of firms in response to bailouts . to this end",
    ", game - theoretic models are proposed in  @xcite and  @xcite that have two agents : the government and a single private sector entity .",
    "the focus of another set of research efforts has been on the setting of capital and liquidity requirements  @xcite in order to reduce systemic risk .",
    "our work contributes to the literature by taking a network - level view of optimal policies and proposing optimal cash injection strategies for networks in distress .",
    "our present paper extends our earlier work reported in  @xcite .",
    "in addition to ours , several other papers have recently considered cash injection policies for lending networks  @xcite , all based on the framework proposed in  @xcite .",
    "a cash injection targeting policy is developed in  @xcite for an infinitesimally small amount of injected cash .",
    "the basic idea of the policy is to inject the cash into the node with the largest threat index , which is defined as the derivative of the unpaid liability with respect to the current asset value .",
    "however , extending this idea to construct an optimal cash injection policy for non - infinitesimal cash amounts produces an inefficient algorithm , as we show in section  [ subsec : demange ] .",
    "we show that our own method proposed in section  [ subsec : w ] is both more efficient and more flexible , as it can be extended to a more complex stochastic model described in section  [ sec : random - e ] .    in  @xcite ,",
    "bankruptcy costs are incorporated into the model of  @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of that work is showing that because of the bankruptcy costs , it is sometimes beneficial for some solvent banks to form bailout consortia and rescue failing banks .",
    "however , it may happen that the solvent banks do not have enough means to effect a bailout , and in this case external intervention may still be needed .",
    "a multi - period stochastic clearing framework based on  @xcite is proposed in  @xcite , where a lender of last resort monitors the network and may provide liquidity assistance loans to failing nodes .",
    "the paper proposes several strategies that the lender of last resort might follow in making its decisions .",
    "one of these strategies , the so - called max - liquidity policy , aims to solve our problem i during each period .",
    "however ,  @xcite does not describe an algorithm for solving this problem .",
    "another related work is  @xcite . based on the clearing payment framework in  @xcite , the authors of  @xcite study the probability of contagion and amplification of losses due to network effects when the system suffers a random shock .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes the model of financial networks , the clearing payment mechanism , and the notation .",
    "section  [ sec : lp ] shows that if each defaulting node pays its creditors in proportion to the owed amounts , then problem  i and its lagrangian formulation are equivalent to linear programs . a reweighted @xmath0 minimization algorithm to solve problem  ii",
    "is also developed in section  [ sec : lp ] .",
    "section  [ sec : linear_bankruptcy_costs ] considers problem  i under the assumption that the defaulting nodes do not pay anything .",
    "we prove that it is then an np - hard problem and can be formulated as a mixed - integer linear program that can be efficiently solved using modern optimization software for network sizes comparable to the size of the us banking system .",
    "section  [ sec : random - e ] extends problem  i to the situation where the capital of each institution is random .",
    "section  [ sec : da ] proposes a duality - based distributed algorithm to solve problem  i and its lagrangian formulation .",
    ".notation for several vector quantities . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    [ tb : cvxpara ]",
    "@xmath1    let a scalar @xmath2 and an @xmath3 vector @xmath4 be lagrange multipliers for constraint ( [ eq : quadprog2-constraint1 ] ) and ( [ eq : quadprog2-constraint2 ] ) , respectively .",
