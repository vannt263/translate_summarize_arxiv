    "the recent experimental realization of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice has prompted much excitement in both theoretical and experimental physics communities ( for a recent review , see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "most experiments so far have been performed on a sio@xmath5 substrate using the mechanical exfoliation technique developed in ref .   followed by optical detection that is sensitive to the thickness of the substrate . in these experiments",
    "one expects there to be charged impurities located in the substrate with a typical density of @xmath6 with the impurities sitting near the substrate - graphene interface with a typical distance @xmath7 from the graphene sheet . in previous work  @xcite we argued that removing the substrate would remove the charged impurities and enhance mobility .",
    "other models of scattering such as ripples , on the other hand , would lead to enhanced scattering in suspended graphene thereby reducing the mobility , since a freely suspended graphene sheet is expected to be more rippled than one glued to a substrate .",
    "very recently experiments have been performed on suspended graphene  @xcite that find remarkably high mobilities @xmath8 for carrier transport confirming that charged impurities in the substrate were indeed the dominant scattering mechanism limiting the mobility .",
    "signatures from these new experiments ( such as the conductivity still being linear in carrier density ) imply that the remaining impurities in suspended graphene are long - range and are probably charged dopants lying ( i.e. stuck ) on the graphene surface , or remnants of chemicals used during the preparation .",
    "the minimal model we propose here contains only two parameters : the charged impurity density and the typical distance of the impurity from the graphene sheet .",
    "theoretical estimates for these numbers in suspended graphene are hard to come by , for example , a recent dft study  @xcite argues that potassium and sodium dopants are typically located at @xmath9 from a graphite surface . in what follows",
    "we treat @xmath1 and @xmath2 as parameters , and argue that the experimental signatures both at high density and low density effectively constrain these numbers .",
    "turning the problem around , the recent transport experiments on suspended graphene could be used as a spectroscopic tool to identify the properties of the remaining impurities in suspended graphene .",
    "for example , a mobility @xmath8 , implies that @xmath10 , or equivalently , that the distance between the remaining impurities is around @xmath11 with the charged impurities sitting typically at an effective distance of @xmath12 from the graphene sheet .",
    "to calculate the transport properties of graphene , we consider impurities with an effective @xmath13 density @xmath1 located in a plane at a distance @xmath2 , either above or below the graphene sheet . while in reality",
    ", different impurities may be located at different distances , one should therefore think of @xmath2 as an effective or typical impurity distance and @xmath1 as an average 2d impurity density .",
    "alternatively , one could imagine several impurity planes at different distances @xmath14 , and then adding up their respective contributions to conductivity using matthiessen s rule .",
    "as we show below , impurities located farther away are exponentially suppressed , so in this respect , one could then think of @xmath2 then as distance of the closest charged impurities and thus dominating the transport properties . in any case ,",
    "our minimal model for charged impurities contains only two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    for an impurity located at the origin ,",
    "the bare coulomb potential at the point @xmath15 in the graphene sheet is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the impurity charge and @xmath18 is an effective background lattice dielectric constant .",
    "all the properties of the substrate ( or vacuum in the case of suspended graphene ) can be absorbed into a third parameter @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the speed of light , and @xmath22 is the constant graphene fermi velocity that relates energy to momentum in the linear dirac spectrum @xmath23 . the carrier density @xmath24 .",
    "although we keep @xmath25 as an arbitrary number in the theory , we note for concreteness that @xmath26 for graphene on a si0@xmath5 substrate , and @xmath27 for suspended graphene ( see refs .   for further details on the model ) .",
    "the fourier transform of eq .",
    "[ eq : coulomb ] gives @xmath28 where in the second line , we assume linear screening with @xmath29 although our choice of dielectric function has an artificial discontinuity at @xmath30 , its advantage is that it allows for analytic results , and we have checked by numerical integration that this choice of dielectric function and the random phase approximation  @xcite give identical results for all graphene transport properties ( see ref .   and references therein for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "further , we observe that the chiral properties induced by the sub - lattice structure of the honeycomb lattice imply that in contrast to most other electronic systems , @xmath31 scattering is absent in graphene",
    ".    graphene conductivity can then be calculated in boltzmann transport theory where @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the spinor component of the electron ( or hole ) eigenvector of the @xmath35 dirac hamiltonian .",
    "these expressions can be simplified by introducing two dimensionless variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 to find @xmath38    to calculate the transport properties of graphene from coulomb impurities the integral @xmath39 was solved numerically by ando  @xcite , cheianov and falko  @xcite and hwang et al  @xcite .",
    "we explore several limits in which @xmath39 can be solved analytically . in the `` complete screening '' limit",
    ", @xmath40 , nomura and macdonald  @xcite showed that @xmath41 .",
    "this result does not capture the effect of changing the substrate which in turn changes the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "this complete screening approximation is therefore inadequate to study transport in suspended graphene even at a qualitative level .",
    "for example , as we show below , keeping @xmath1 the same , but just changing the dielectric constant from sio@xmath5 to vacuum , would actually decrease mobility by almost a factor of 2 .",
    "therefore , in suspended graphene the two effects of reducing both dielectric constant and @xmath1 actually compete to determine graphene mobility ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "taking @xmath42 , but keeping the @xmath25 dependence , we showed  @xcite that @xmath43 @xmath44}{x^2 } = \\frac{\\pi}{4 } + 3x - \\frac{3 \\pi x^2}{2 }   + \\frac{x(3x^2 - 2)\\arccos[1/x]}{\\sqrt{x^2 -1}}.\\ ] ] we note here that the following additional limits can be solved : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a modified bessel function and @xmath47 is a modified struve function .",
    "we also have @xmath48 , where this last result says that for very large density , coulomb impurities in graphene give @xmath49 .",
    "however , this is not the limit relevant to experiments , which are all in the low density regime .",
    "the following expansion captures both the substrate ( i.e. @xmath25 dependence ) and the @xmath2 dependence , and is relevant for current experiments both on suspended graphene and for graphene on a sio@xmath5 substrate @xmath50 - d \\sqrt{n } f[x ] } , \\label{eq : main}\\ ] ] where @xmath51}{2 \\sqrt{\\pi } x^2 } = \\frac{1}{3 } - \\frac{\\pi x}{2 }   - 4 x^2 + 2 \\pi x^3 + \\frac{x^2(3 - 4x^2)\\arccos[1/x]}{\\sqrt{x^2 -1}}.\\ ] ] we note that for most relevant substrates @xmath52 , ( recall that for a sio@xmath5 substrate @xmath53 and for suspended graphene @xmath54 ) , and that the ratio @xmath55 = f[x]/g[x]$ ] does not change significantly from its large @xmath25 asymptote of @xmath56 .",

    "we find eq .",
    "[ eq : useful ] to be a very useful formula for all existing bulk graphene transport data in the literature .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of mobility @xmath63 . defining mobility in graphene",
    "is both important and problematic .",
    "the importance stems mostly from it being the figure of merit for graphene s application as a practical transistor device",
    ". however , close to the dirac point we have @xmath64 but finite resistivity .",
    "if one naively assumes that @xmath65 in this regime _ as is often done _ , then one can get arbitrarily high values of mobility which is completely meaningless ( a detailed discussion of this point can be found in ref .  ) . calculating mobility at very high density",
    "is complicated by the fact that both super - linear contributions ( see eq .  [ eq : main ] for finite @xmath2 ) and sub - linear contributions from short - range scatterers ( see ref .   and",
    "discussion in sect .",
    "[ sect : discuss ] below ) come into play , so that mobility is not constant for a given sample . in this case , mobility would be a non - monotonic function of carrier density whose maximum value is given by a competition of different scattering mechanisms present in graphene .",
    "we have consistently argued that the best definition of graphene mobility is the slope @xmath66 just beyond the dirac point conductivity plateau , i.e. only within the window of density where the conductivity is _ strictly linear _ in @xmath67 .",
    "we advocate this choice because at low density , one can show theoretically that both the sub - linear and super - linear contributions to the conductivity are small . for this definition of mobility",
    ", one can immediately see that @xmath68 = \\frac{5}{g[x]}\\frac{n_0}{n_{\\rm imp } } , \\label{eq : mob}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 .",
    "although our theory has two free parameters , i.e. @xmath1 and @xmath2 , knowing the mobility immediately determines @xmath1 through eq .",
    "[ eq : mob ] . a careful characterization of the super - linear contribution using eq .",
    "[ eq : main ] could then be used to determine @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , as we describe below , the low density transport properties i.e. the value of the minimum conductivity , the width of the minimum conductivity plateau and the offset of the dirac point depend only on these two parameters that in principle could already be determined from the high - density transport data .",
    "so far we have formulated everything in terms of carrier density @xmath24 . for large external gate voltage , we can map our results to applied gate voltage using @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is experimentally determined to be @xmath72 for graphene on sio@xmath5 and @xmath73 for suspended graphene  @xcite .",
    "the last step is to determine the carrier density @xmath74 close to the dirac point .",
    "the low density conductivity arises from the carriers in the charge - impurity induced puddles of electrons and holes  @xcite .",
    "we argued in ref .",
    "that at low density it was appropriate to use the _ rms _ density caused by the inhomogeneous potential induced by the same charged impurities that are responsible for the high - density transport properties .",

    "the offset in the dirac point is given by @xmath78 ( a derivation of this result can be found in ref .  ) .",
    "the value of @xmath79 calculated from this self - consistent calculation agrees with a recent calculation that minimizes the graphene energy functional in the presence of disorder  @xcite and for @xmath80 is consistent with the experimental observations of density inhomogeneities on a sio@xmath5 substrate  @xcite .",
    "given the choice of substrate ( which determines @xmath25 ) and picking @xmath1 and @xmath2 completely determines the conductivity at high density and the non - universal disorder dependent minimum conductivity plateau at low density .",
    "to illustrate our results , in what follows , we choose the experimental parameters reported in ref .  .",
    "we use mobility @xmath81 for graphene on a substrate ( corresponding to @xmath82 ) and @xmath8 for suspended graphene ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "we also employ a hard cut - off between the low and high density regime such that @xmath84 if @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] is the resistivity as a function of gate voltage for both suspended graphene and graphene on a sio@xmath5 substrate .",
    "an important observation is that the higher mobility samples have a lower resistivity which is an important prediction of our self - consistent theory  @xcite .",
    "this has been verified both in transport measurements on sio@xmath5 substrate  @xcite and by intentionally adding charged impurities in ultra - high vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the recent data  @xcite on ultra - high mobility suspended graphene samples further confirm that charged impurities provide the dominant scattering mechanism in graphene and are responsible for the _ non - universal _ minimum conductivity .",
    "we note that in plotting resistivity , all the super - linear behavior is obscured and the high - density curves of the same mobility but different @xmath2 look quite similar .",
    "by contrast , from the properties of the low density `` dirac plateau '' one can extract the magnitude of @xmath2 , but we caution that we only expect our self - consistent carrier density theory to agree within a factor of two with the experimentally observed plateau width , dirac point offset and the maximum resistivity",

    "we argue that transport data not only provide information about @xmath1 but also @xmath2 , thereby being a tool to not only identify different types of scattering mechanisms ( e.g. short - range , long - range , phonons ) but for coulomb impurities , it provides information about the location of the impurities . in fig .

    "one finds that for most of the experimental regime , the analytical expression is an excellent approximation for the boltzmann conductivity , but that at very high - density and large @xmath2 , it slightly over - estimates the super - linear behavior .",
    "however , in this high - density regime , one also expects the contribution of non - coulombic short - range scatterers which reduce the conductivity . for large @xmath2 and a particular ratio of short - range and coulomb scatterers ,",
    "one may even have non - monotonic mobility that first increases because of our predicted super - linear contribution and then decreases as short - range scattering becomes more dominant at higher densities .",
    "= 0.9    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfp ] , we show our calculated carrier mean free path ( @xmath91 ) as a function of carrier density , comparing graphene on sio@xmath5 substrate with suspended graphene .",
    "it is remarkable that , for reasonable parameters ( same as fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] ) used in these results , the suspended graphene @xmath92 for @xmath93 whereas for the same density range in graphene on sio@xmath5 substrate , the charged impurities give rise to an almost constant @xmath94 . as noted by bolotin et al .",
    "@xcite such long ( @xmath95 ) mean free paths are comparable to the 2d system size of the samples , implying ballistic transport and a breakdown of our diffusive theory .",
    "it is important to realize that for mean free paths comparable to the sample size , strong short - range scattering will be imposed by the sample edges leading to a saturation of the conductivity and the mean - free - paths around this density .",
    "note , however , that the current graphene samples on the substrate are _ always _ in the diffusive limit , and graphene transport around the dirac point ( both with and without substrate ) is also _ always _ in the diffusive limit since the mean free path is much shorter than the sample size . of course , by making nanoribbons  @xcite with sample sizes comparable to @xmath91 , one can artificially induce ballistic transport .",
    "in this work , we have generalized the transport theory of ref .   to the case of suspended graphene  @xcite and derived analytical results for the super - linear contribution to conductivity expected for coulomb scatterers at a finite distance @xmath2 from the graphene sheet . however , this effect becomes pronounced only at high density where short - range scattering begins to dominate over coulomb scattering .",
    "we note that in the experiments of bolotin et .",
    "al  @xcite , they were only able to reach rather low carrier densities , and therefore we believe that coulomb scattering dominates over all other scattering mechanisms in their results . however , as was pointed out in ref .",
    ", there may be strong short - range scattering by sample edges when the mean free path becomes comparable to the system size .",
    "however one can anticipate for the dirac plateau in cleaner samples ( such as future suspended graphene experiments ) , charged impurities will induce a smaller carrier density @xmath79 , _ even as the ratio _",
    "@xmath96 is increasing .",
    "for example , a sample with mobility of @xmath97 , would have @xmath98 which for @xmath99 gives @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this gives @xmath102 .",
    "so despite the high - mobility , the peculiar scaling @xmath103 for coulomb scatterers in graphene implies that close to the charge neutral point , we are in the diffusive boltzmann transport regime .",
    "however , at higher carrier density we have @xmath104 , suggesting that the ballistic regime could be explored away from the dirac point . for mesoscopic samples constructed in the geometry of @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the sample size",
    ", our theory does not apply .",
    "smaller sample sizes would also increase the effect of edge scattering , which act as short - range scattering centers . as was argued in hwang et al .",
    "@xcite at high density these begin to dominate showing a non - universal cross - over from the low - density regime where @xmath107 is linear in @xmath74 to the high - density limit where @xmath107 is constant .",
    "so while in this work we have focused on coulomb scattering that dominates at low density , probing a wider density range could also distinguish between different scattering mechanisms .",
    "we emphasize here that detailed measurements and analysis of @xmath108 could thus provide in - depth spectroscopic information about the impurity distribution in graphene , far surpassing the resolution of currently available scanning microscopy measurements  @xcite which directly probe the potential landscape .",
    "finally we note that alternative theories for the dominant scattering mechanism in graphene make predictions that are inconsistent with the results of bolotin et al .  @xcite .",
    "for example , if ripples were the dominant scattering mechanism , then suspended graphene would have stronger ripples and hence lower mobility .",
    "it was one of our early predictions that removing charged impurities in the substrate would increase mobility and increase the minimum conductivity . the initial conventional wisdom in the theoretical community that graphene experiments were observing the universal dirac minimum conductivity should now be discarded after recent experimental developments including intentionally doping graphene with potassium in ref .   and measurements done on graphene with mobility varying close to three orders of magnitude in refs .   and most particularly the suspended graphene measurements ,",
    "all of which clearly demonstrate the importance of charged impurity disorder controlling the minimum conductivity plateau .",
    "it was in refs .",
    "that we predicted that charged impurities in graphene would give rise to a non - universal minimum conductivity whose value would increase with cleaner samples .",
    "these predictions have now been vindicated in light of recent experiments .",
    "it , therefore , appears that the existing graphene transport experiments are completely dominated by charged impurity scattering , and no universal `` dirac point physics '' is in play near the charge neutrality point .",
    "the physics of the charge neutrality point is dominated by diffusive transport through electron and hole puddles induced by the charged impurities .",
    "we believe that the close agreement between our theory and the transport data in suspended graphene experiments establishes the dominance of charged impurity scattering in graphene beyond any reasonable doubt ."
