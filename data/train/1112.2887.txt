    "rational approximants to the exponential function have been the object of numerous studies in the literature .",
    "one motivation comes from the fact that the approximation of the exponential function naturally appears in many problems from applied mathematics , like , for instance , the stability of numerical methods for solving differential equations , the modeling of time - delay systems to be found , e.g. in electrical or mechanical engineering , and the efficient computation of the exponential of a matrix .",
    "another , more theoretical , motivation comes from the particular properties of the exponential and its approximants in the framework of function theory .",
    "one classical example of such properties is pad s theorem about the convergence of pad approximants to the exponential , and its connection with deep results in analytic number theory .",
    "another typical problem has been the one of finding the rate of rational approximation to the exponential on the semi - axis , the so - called @xmath14-conjecture .",
    "it attracted the efforts of many authors in the eighties and was eventually solved in @xcite .",
    "the behavior of pad approximants to the exponential function has been studied , among others , in @xcite , and for extensions to hermite - pad approximants , one may consult @xcite .",
    "generalizations to rational interpolants are investigated in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that rational interpolants to the exponential function with bounded complex interpolation points ( also with points growing like a logarithm of the degree ) converge locally uniformly in the complex plane , as the degree of the interpolant tends to infinity .",
    "the proof uses the deift - zhou steepest descent method for riemann - hilbert problems @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we consider the case of interpolation points whose modulus may grow with the degree @xmath1 of the interpolants , namely like @xmath15 , @xmath7 , and we show that the deift - zhou method can still be used to show convergence of the interpolants as @xmath16 . for interpolation points",
    "whose growth is linear with respect to the degree , it is easy to see from the periodicity of the exponential on the imaginary axis that convergence can not always hold true . also , for the particular case of shifted pad approximants , interpolating the exponential at the point @xmath17 , @xmath18 , it is possible to give a necessary and sufficient condition on @xmath19 for convergence to hold true , see @xcite .",
    "let us now describe our findings in more detail .",
    "given a triangular sequence of complex interpolation points @xmath20 , @xmath21 , we are interested in the behavior , as @xmath22 becomes large , of the rational function @xmath23 , with @xmath24 polynomials satisfying the conditions : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 with @xmath28 for any choice of ( possibly multiple ) interpolation points , nontrivial polynomials @xmath29 and @xmath30 , such that ( [ degree])([interpolation ] ) hold true , always exist since these conditions are equivalent to a system of @xmath31 homogeneous linear equations with @xmath32 unknowns .    in this paper , we will only be interested in the diagonal case @xmath33 and @xmath34 though the general case could be studied similarly .",
    "as we will see in the sequel , even if we restrict ourselves to the diagonal case , pairs of polynomials of type @xmath35 , that is of degrees respectively less than or equal to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , will show up in the study .",
    "let us write @xmath38 if the interpolation points do not grow too rapidly with @xmath1 , i.e.if there exist constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 such that @xmath39 it was proved in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.2 ) that a pair @xmath40 , such that ( [ degree - diag])-([interpolation - diag ] ) hold true ( with @xmath41 ) , satisfies @xmath42 locally uniformly in @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is normalized so that @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , @xmath46 converges to @xmath47 uniformly on compact sets in the complex plane as @xmath16 .",
    "our aim is to weaken the condition ( [ logbound ] ) to interpolation points for which there exists @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( independent of @xmath1 ) such that @xmath48 this is our main result .",
    "[ main thm ] let @xmath49 , @xmath4 , @xmath50 , be a family of interpolation points satisfying ( [ nbound ] ) with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be polynomials satisfying ( [ degree - diag])-([interpolation - diag ] ) .",
    "then , the following three assertions hold true :    1 .",
    "all the zeros and poles of @xmath53 tend to infinity , as @xmath1 becomes large , and , more precisely , no zeros and poles of @xmath54 lie in the disk @xmath55 , for @xmath1 large .",
    "in particular , dividing equation ( [ interpolation - diag ] ) by @xmath52 , we get @xmath56 as a rational interpolant to @xmath47 satisfying @xmath57 2 .   as @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath58 locally uniformly in @xmath43 , where @xmath52 is normalized so that @xmath59 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath1 large ,",

    "an assumption on the growth of @xmath66 is mandatory . indeed ,",
    "if we allow @xmath66 to grow linearly in the degree , that is @xmath67 with @xmath8 some constant , the theorem can be false .",
    "for instance , if @xmath68 , it suffices to consider the constant function @xmath69 which interpolates the exponential @xmath2 at the points @xmath70 and does not converge to it as @xmath1 tends to infinity .",
    "the particular case of shifted pad approximants also shows that the theorem is false for linear growth , even for constant @xmath12 smaller than @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , denote by @xmath72 the positive real root of the equation @xmath73 then , it follows from results in @xcite that shifted pad approximants of degree @xmath1 , interpolating @xmath2 at the point @xmath74 , where @xmath12 is any real number with @xmath75 , does not converge to @xmath2 .",
    "still , we conjecture that theorem [ main thm ] remains true if @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "the next theorem describes the limit distributions , as @xmath16 , of the zeros of the scaled polynomials @xmath78 and @xmath79 defined by @xmath80 for that , we need to introduce critical trajectories of the quadratic differential @xmath81 , defined by the condition @xmath82 in ( [ crit ] ) we assume that the square root has a branch cut along the path of integration and behaves like @xmath83 at infinity . by @xmath84",
    "we denote the @xmath85 boundary value of the square root on that path of integration .",
    "an explicit integration of the differential form in the integral actually shows that condition ( [ crit ] ) can be rewritten in the equivalent form @xmath86 , with @xmath87 the expression in the right - hand side of ( [ crit - eq ] ) .    from the discussion in @xcite",
    ", it follows that there are four critical trajectories , see figure [ traject ] .",
    "we define @xmath88 to be the critical trajectory connecting @xmath89 with @xmath90 in the left half of the complex plane ; the other critical trajectories are the mirror image @xmath91 of @xmath88 with respect to the imaginary axis , and the vertical half - lines @xmath92 .",
    "these curves determine three domains that we denote by @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 as in figure [ traject ] .",
    "next , we define two positive measures respectively supported on the curves @xmath96 and @xmath97 , namely @xmath98 and , for a polynomial @xmath99 of degree @xmath1 , we denote by @xmath100 the normalized zero counting measure @xmath101 then , the following theorem holds true .",
    "[ weak - lim ] as @xmath1 tends to infinity , we have @xmath102 where the convergence is in the sense of weak-@xmath103 convergence of measures .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we display a few basic properties of the rational interpolants and characterize them in terms of the solution of a specific matrix riemann - hilbert ( rh ) problem . in section 3 , we introduce different functions that are useful for the steepest descent analysis of the rh problem , which we perform in section 4 . from this analysis",
    "we derive in section 5 our main results .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we present numerical experiments in the case of interpolation points of order @xmath1 .",
    "as said before , polynomials @xmath104 and @xmath44 such that ( [ degree - diag])([interpolation - diag ] ) hold true always exist . about uniqueness , we have the following simple proposition .",
