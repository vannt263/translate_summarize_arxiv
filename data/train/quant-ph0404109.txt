    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation opened the possibility to generate macroscopic atomic fields whose quantum statistical properties can in principle be manipulated and controlled @xcite .",
    "the system considered here to this purpose is an elongated bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) driven by a far off - resonant pump laser of wave vector @xmath0 along the condensate long axis and coupled to a single mode in an optical ring cavity .",

    "the scattered radiation mode and the atomic momentum side modes become macroscopically occupied via a collective instability .",
    "a peculiar aspect of the quantum regime is the possibility of populating single momentum modes separated by @xmath1 off the condensate ground state with zero initial momentum .",
    "the experimental observation of carl in a bec has been until now realized in the so - called superradiant regime @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ without the optical cavity . in this case",
    "the radiation is emitted along the end - fire modes of the condensate @xcite with very large radiation losses ( in the mean field model , with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the cavity decay rate and @xmath4 is the condensate length ) . in a recent work @xcite",
    "it has been shown that atom - atom and atom - photon entanglement can be produced in the linear regime of carl , in which the ground state of the condensate remains approximately undepleted .",
    "in this regime the atomic multi - mode system can be described by only two momentum side modes , with @xmath5 .",
    "this source of entanglement has been also proposed for a quantum teleportation scheme among atoms and photons @xcite .",
    "the results presented in @xcite refer to the ideal case of a perfect optical cavity and an atomic system free of decoherence .",
    "however , in view of an experimental observation of entanglement , a detailed analysis of the sources of noise is in order , which in turn may be a serious limitation for entanglement in carl @xcite .",
    "also , it has not yet been proved that bec superradiance experiments may generate entangled atom - photon states , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "this issue is investigated for the first time in this paper , where we demonstrate the entangled properties of the atom - atom and atom - photon pairs produced in the linear stage of the superradiant carl regime in a bec .",
    "the aim of the present work is to analyze systematically , by solving the three - mode master equation in the wigner representation , the effects of losses and decoherence on the generation of entanglement .",

    "the analysis has been focused of the different dynamical regimes , the high - q cavity regime , with low cavity losses , and the superradiant regime in the so - called bad - cavity limit. we have found that entanglement in the high - q cavity regime is generally robust against either cavity or decoherence losses . on the contrary ,",
