    "the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model  @xcite is realized in a slice of the ads@xmath0 space - time with the background warped metric : @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 being the `` radius '' of extra dimension , and @xmath5 is the minkowski metric .",
    "the points @xmath6 and @xmath7 are identified .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 defines a 5-dimensional scalar curvature of the ads@xmath0 space .",
    "namely , the ricci curvature invariant @xmath9 .",
    "that is why , in what follows we will call @xmath8 `` curvature '' .",
    "there are two 3d branes in the model with equal and opposite tensions located at the point @xmath10 ( called the _ tev brane _ ) and point @xmath11 ( referred to as the _ plank brane _ ) . if @xmath12 , the tension on the tev brane is negative , whereas the tension on the planck brane is positive .",
    "all the sm fields are confined to the tev brane , while the gravity propagates in all five dimensions .",
    "it is necessary to note that the metric is chosen in such a way that 4-dimensional coordinates @xmath13 are galilean on the tev brane where all the sm field live , since the warp factor is equal to unity at @xmath10 .",
    "( for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ] by integrating a 5-dimensional action over variable @xmath14 , one gets an effective 4-dimensional action , that results in the `` hierarchy relation '' between the reduced planck scale @xmath15 and 5-dimensional gravity scale @xmath16 : @xmath17 the reduced 5-dimensional planck mass @xmath16 is related to the planck mass by @xmath18 .    from the point of view of a 4-dimensional observer located on the tev brane , there exists an infinite number of graviton kk excitations with masses @xmath19 where @xmath20 are zeros of the bessel function @xmath21 .",
    "the interaction lagrangian on the visible brane looks like the following : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter on this brane , @xmath24 is a graviton field with the kk - number @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is a scalar field called radion .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 in eq .",
    ", @xmath28 is a physical scale on the tev brane .    in most of the papers which treat the rs model , the hierarchy relation is of the form @xmath29 while the curvature and 5-dimensional gravity scale are chosen to be of the order of the planck mass : @xmath30 in such a scheme , one obtains a series of massive graviton resonances in the tev region which interact rather strongly with the sm fields , since @xmath31 tev on the tev brane .",
    "the lightest modes of the kk graviton have masses around 1 tev .",
    "thus , an experimental signature of the `` _ _ large curvature option _ _ '' of the rs model is the real or virtual production of the massive kk graviton resonances .",
    "there are lower bounds on the mass of the lightest kk mode , coming from the measurements of @xmath32 and @xmath33 final states on the tevatron  @xcite : @xmath34 the lhc search limit on @xmath35 is @xcite @xmath36 for the di - jet mode and integrated luminosity @xmath37 . for the di - photon mode and @xmath38 , the limit looks like  @xcite @xmath39    in the case of large curvature , the size of the @xmath40 slice is extremely small : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a planck length .",
    "thus , in order to explain the huge value of @xmath15 , one has to introduce large mass scales @xmath16 , @xmath8 , as well as @xmath43 . in other words ,",
    "_ hierarchy problem is not solved , but reformulated _ in terms of the new parameter related to the size of the bulk along the extra dimension . in the present paper",
    "we will consider the `` _ _ small curvature option _ _ '' of the rs model  @xcite . in what follows , the 5-dimensional reduced planck mass @xmath16 is taken to be one or few tev . following ref .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , we chose the parameter @xmath8 to be @xmath44 .",
    "these values of @xmath8 obey the bounds derived in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath45 then the mass of the lightest kk excitation @xmath46  gev .    on the contrary ,",
    "the value of the mass scale @xmath27   is rather large : @xmath47 it immediately follows from eqs .",
    ", that there is no problem with the radion field @xmath26 in our scheme , since its coupling to the sm fields ( @xmath48 ) is strongly suppressed .    as for the massive gravitons ,",
    "their couplings are also defined by the scale @xmath27  .",
    "however , the smallness of the coupling is compensated by the large number of the gravitons that can be produced in any inclusive process . as a result",
    ", magnitudes of cross sections will be defined by the 5-dimensional gravity scale @xmath16 and collision energy @xmath49 ( see below ) .",
    "thus , we have an infinite number of low - mass kk resonances with the small mass splitting , in contrast with the standard rs scenario  .",
    "nevertheless , due to the warp geometry of the @xmath40 space - time , the rs model with the small curvature differs significantly from the add model  @xcite ( at least , at @xmath50 ev ) , as was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us stress that the hierarchy relation explains the value of the 4-dimensional planck mass without introducing large mass scales , if one put @xmath51 .",
    "recently , the small curvature option of the rs model has been checked by the delphi collaboration .",
    "the gravity effects were searched for by studying photon energy spectrum in the process @xmath52 .",
    "no deviations from the sm prediction were seen . as a result , the following bound has been obtained  @xcite : @xmath53 that corresponds to the reduced 5-dimensional scale @xmath54 tev ( see the relation between @xmath55 and @xmath16 after eq .  ) .",
    "note that this limit could not be inferred from the limits already given for larger than two flat dimensions owing to the totally different spectrum of the photon  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will consider now the bhabha process at the ilc collider  @xcite mediated by massive graviton exchanges : , @xmath56 are also promising reactions . ]",
    "@xmath57    the collision energy @xmath49 is taken to be 1 tev .",
    "it means that we are working in the following region : @xmath58    the matrix element of the process   looks like @xmath59 the fist factor in eq .   is the contraction of the the tensor part of the graviton propagator , @xmath60 , and the energy - momentum tensor of the electron , @xmath61 : @xmath62    the second factor in eq .",
    "is _ universal _ for all types of processes mediated by @xmath63 or @xmath64-channel exchange of the massive kk excitations .",
    "let us consider first the contribution to @xmath65 from the @xmath63-channel gravitons : @xmath66 here @xmath67 denotes the total width of the graviton with the kk number @xmath25 and mass @xmath68  @xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "note that the main contribution to sum   comes from the region @xmath71 . for such large values of the kk number @xmath25 , _ nonzero widths of the gravitons should be taken into account_.    the sum in eq .",
    "can be calculated analytically by the use of the formula  @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) are zeros of the function @xmath75 . as a result",
    ", the following explicit expression can be obtained from ( for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath76 with the notations @xmath77    as one can see from , the magnitude of @xmath78 is defined by @xmath16 and @xmath49 , _ not by _ @xmath27 , although the latter describes the graviton coupling with the matter in the effective lagrangian",
    ".    the following inequalities result from : @xmath79 @xmath80 where the notation @xmath81 \\ , \\mathcal{s}(s)$ ] was introduced .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath82 decreases with energy and becomes small at @xmath83 , while @xmath84 tends to @xmath85 .",
    "should one ignores the widths of the massive gravitons , and replace a summation in kk number by integration over graviton masses , @xmath86 he gets @xcite : @xmath87 in contrast to the exact formula .",
    "however , the series of low - massive resonances in the rs model with the small curvature can be replace by the continuous spectrum _ only in a trans - planckian energy region _ @xmath88 .",
    "it can be understood as follows .",
    "one may regard the set of narrow graviton resonances to be the continuous mass spectrum ( within a relevant interval of @xmath25 ) , if only @xmath89 is satisfied , where @xmath90 is the mass splitting . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inequality is equivalent to the above mentioned inequality @xmath91    we are working in another kinematical region , @xmath92 , since the 5-dimensional scale @xmath93 is assumed to be equal to ( or larger than ) 1 tev , while the collision energy is fixed to be 1 tev .",
    "that is why , for our calculations we will use the analytical expression   which takes into account both the discrete character of the graviton spectrum and finite widths of the kk gravitons .",
    "our main formula   can be also applied to the scattering of the brane particles , induced by exchanges of @xmath64-channel gravitons  @xcite . in the kinematical region @xmath94",
    ", the contribution from the @xmath64-channel gravitons looks like  @xcite : @xmath95    let us now apply our theoretical formulae , for estimating virtual graviton contributions to the process .",
    "the relations of cross sections with the quantities @xmath78 and @xmath96 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "note first that at the lep2 energy ( @xmath97 gev ) the gravity effects are very small with respect to the sm cross section  @xcite .",
    "thus , the above mentioned bound on @xmath16 from lep   should be also applied to the 5-dimensional scale in our scheme .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2.5tev_1gev ] the graviton contribution is presented as a function of the scattering angle of the final electrons at the ilc energy @xmath98 tev ( solid line ) .",
    "another prediction is also shown ( dashed line ) which was calculated under the assumption that the dense spectrum of the kk gravitons can be approximated by a continuum  @xcite .",
    "the next figure shows the dependence of the cross section ratios on the gravity scale @xmath16 . figs .",
    "[ fig:1.8tev_0.9gev ] , [ fig:1.8tev_0.994gev ] demonstrate us that these ratios can be very sensitive to small variations of the curvature @xmath8 within a narrow region ( 0.9 gev",
    " 1 gev , in our case ) .",
    "let us note that the interference of gravity with the sm forces is constructive in the bhabha scattering , and the ratio @xmath99 is lager than 1 .    up to now",
    ", we considered the fixed collision energy .",
    "however , the effects related with non - zero graviton widths remain significant after energy smearing within some interval around average value of @xmath49 , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhabha_average ] .",
    "note that the energy smearing has a small influence on the cross section ratios in the kinematical region @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "in the present paper the contributions of the virtual @xmath63- and @xmath64-channel kk gravitons to the bhabha scattering at the ilc energy @xmath98 tev were estimated .",
    "we have considered the small curvature option of the rs model with two branes ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "in such a scheme , the kk graviton spectrum is a series of the narrow low - mass resonances .",
    "the 5-dimensional planck scale @xmath55 was taken to be 1.8 tev and 2.5 tev , with the curvature parameter being restricted to the small region @xmath102 , that means @xmath103 .",
    "for numerical estimates , we used formula  , which describes the gravity contribution to the process - independent part of the scattering amplitude @xmath65  .    for comparison",
    ", we have made calculations by using eqs .   which treat the spectrum of the kk graviton as a continuum .",
    "it was demonstrated that the sum in the kk number can not be approximated by integration over graviton mass .",
    "moreover , the graviton widths should be properly taken into account , as formula does .",
    "our predictions are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:2.5tev_1gev]-[fig : bhabha_average ]  @xcite .",
    "everywhere @xmath104 means the sm differential cross section with respect to @xmath105 , while @xmath106 means the differential cross section which takes into account both the sm and gravity interactions .",
    "one should conclude that at fixed value of the fundamental gravity scale @xmath55 , the cross section ratio is very sensitive even to slight variations of the curvature @xmath8 ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig:1.8tev_1gev ] , [ fig:1.8tev_0.9gev ] and [ fig:1.8tev_0.994gev ] ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath99 can reach tens at some values of the parameters ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:1.8tev_0.994gev ] ) .",
    "such a behavior of the cross section ratios comes from the explicit form of the function @xmath78  . indeed , at @xmath107 the parameter @xmath108 in eq .",
    "is much less than 1 , and the function @xmath78 has a significant real part . in the trans - planckian region @xmath109 . ] the interference with the sm contributions results in a nontrivial dependence of @xmath99 on @xmath105 . given the approximation with zero real part is used , no interference terms exist , and @xmath110-dependence of the cross section ratio becomes similar for all sets of the parameters ( dashed curves in figs .",
    "[ fig:2.5tev_1gev]-[fig:1.8tev_0.994gev ] ) .",
    "if the parameter @xmath111 in formula obeys the equation @xmath112 , the denominator in becomes small , and , correspondingly , the function @xmath78 becomes large .",
    "it results in the rapid variation of the gravity contribution near corresponding values of @xmath8 .",
    "it is worth to note that both a discrete character of the mass spectrum and nonzero widths of the kk gravitons are also important in a model with a _ flat _ compact extra dimension  @xcite .",
