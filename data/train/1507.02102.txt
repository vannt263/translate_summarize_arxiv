    "josephson effect has been a fundamental and central topic in superconductivity and contributed to determine the pairing symmetry in unconventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "it is well known that standard current - phase relation ( cpr ) of josephson current @xmath5 between two superconductors is @xmath10 , where @xmath2 is the macroscopic phase difference . for @xmath0-wave superconductor ( ds ) junctions , due to the presence of andreev bound state at the interface @xcite , exotic quantum interference effects exist .",
    "one is the non - monotonic temperature dependence of maximum josephson current @xcite and second is the anomalous cpr @xcite . due to the presence of abs , @xmath11 component of @xmath5",
    "is enhanced and free energy of the junction can locate neither @xmath12 nor @xmath13 . furthermore , a pure @xmath14 cpr is possible for @xmath15-wave /@xmath16-wave superconductor junction@xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath0-wave junctions have really rich current phase relation and its functionalities worth for further research .    on the other hand , 3d topological insulators ( tis ) fu07prb , zsc09,hsieh08,hsieh09,hasan09,chen09,xia09,ando10 is a material with a topologically protected surface state due to the strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the generation of superconductivity on the surface state of ti via proximity effect has been verified by the presence of supercurrent through the josephson junctions on ti @xcite .",
    "josephson current in superconductor(s)/ferromagnetic insulator(fi)/s junction on ti stimulates us since anomalous cpr @xmath17 discussed in conventional s / ferromagnet ( f)/s junction without ti @xcite can be realized easily .",
    "it is noted that @xmath18 can be tunable by magnetization @xcite .",
    "we can imagine that more dramatic features will be expected in @xmath0-wave superconductor(ds ) /fi / ds josephson junctions on ti .",
    "although there have been several works about ds / fi / ds junctions @xcite , cpr has not been clarified for general orientations of the junctions .",
    "recent experiments have shown that induced gap function on the surface of ti which is formed on high-@xmath9 cuprate is almost isotropic .",
    "this shows that the induced pair potential has predominant @xmath7-wave symmetry@xcite .",
    "the possibility of inducing @xmath0-wave pairing on ti surface in the actual experiment is still on debate now @xcite .",
    "therefore , besides the cpr in @xmath0-wave superconductor junctions , we must study the cpr in junctions with @xmath7+@xmath0-wave symmetry for comparison with actual experiments .    in this paper , in order to calculate dc josephson current",
    ", we develop a formalism of green s function of quasiparticles on the surface of ti @xcite .",
    "both josephson current and local density of states ( ldos ) can be calculated for general orientations of junctions . in general",
    ", the obtained current phase relation @xmath5 has a complex @xmath19 dependence .",
    "@xmath20 is easily to be broken by magnetization in fi and @xmath5 can not be simply expressed by @xmath21 with nonzero @xmath22 .",
    "the extreme case is @xmath15/fi/@xmath16-wave junctions , where cpr becomes @xmath11 without magnetization due to the absence of the first order josephson coupling .",
    "if we switch on magnetization , exotic cpr becomes possible depending on the direction of magnetization in fi : i)mixture of @xmath6 and @xmath23 terms with @xmath3 and ii)@xmath24 .",
    "the complex cpr @xmath3 with @xmath4 periodicity in i ) is not realized in the preexisting high-@xmath9 cuprate junctions without ti @xcite .",
    "we also calculate josephson current where @xmath7-wave and @xmath0-wave pair potentials mix .",
    "it is found that the anomalous cpr with @xmath8 exists for junctions of asymmetric orientations even if @xmath7-wave component becomes dominant .",
    "this feature serves as a guide to detect the proximity induced @xmath0-wave component of pair potential on the surface of ti .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the model and derive the retarded green s function and josephson current . in section iii ,",
    "we show numerical results of josephson current in ds / fi / ds junctions . in section iv",
    ", we show the corresponding results of josephson junctions when @xmath7-wave component is induced in ds . a concluding remarks will be given in section v.",
    "as depicted in fig.[fig1](a ) , we consider a ds / fi / ds junction on a 3d ti surface .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the bdg equations is given by @xmath25 ,   \\label{hamiltonian}\\]]where @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the pauli matrix in the spin space and @xmath28 is the chemical potential in the superconducting region .",
    "the exchange field in fi region is @xmath29tanaka2009 .",
    "the pair potential is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath2 and @xmath31 are the macroscopic superconducting phase and the propagating angle , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath32 is taken to be the angle between the @xmath33-axis and the @xmath34-axis of @xmath0-wave superconductor on top of the ti surface .",
    "@xmath35 is assumed to obey the bcs relation @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath9 is the critical temperature .    to construct the retarded green s function ,",
    "we first seek the solutions for the four types of quasiparticle injection processes : left injection for electron ( hole ) : @xmath38 and right injection for electron ( hole ) : @xmath39 . because of",
    "the translational invariance along @xmath40-axis , the wave functions @xmath41 in the left superconducting region can be expressed as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 . here the magnitudes of the momenta for electrons and holes are approximated to be equal since we have made the assumption of @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the spinors are given by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "other wave functions can be solved in a similar way .",
    "the retarded green s function @xmath52 can be obtained by combing all the injection processes@xcite :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 are the corresponding conjugated processes of @xmath55 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 are determined by satisfying the boundary conditions for all @xmath58 , @xmath59 across the regions:@xmath60where @xmath61 is the pauli matrix in the particle - hole space .",
    "the dc josephson current for ds / fi / ds junction is determined by electric charge conservation rule @xmath62where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 $ ] are electric charge density , electric current and source term , respectively . after straightforward derivation following ref.@xcite , we find that the total josephson current is given by@xmath66 .",
    "\\label{ft}\\]]@xmath67 is obtained by analytical continuation @xmath44 to @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the matsubara frequency @xmath70 .",
    "eq.([ft ] ) looks similar to the extended furusaki - tsukada s formula@xcite for anisotropic @xmath0-wave pair potentialtanakad96,tanakad97 .",
    "in addition , eq.([ft ] ) is also applicable to the josephson current of @xmath7+@xmath0 wave pairing in which one substitutes @xmath71 by @xmath72 of which @xmath73 is the ratio between @xmath0-wave pairing and @xmath7-wave pairing .",
    "in this section , we show the results of josephson current @xmath74 in ds / fi / ds junctions , which has been normalized to @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the interface resistance per unit area in the normal state . to analyze the cpr further",
    ", we decompose the josephson current into a series of different orders of josephson coupling , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is an integer .",
    "fig.[fig2](a ) shows cpr without magnetization . in this case , the cpr is expressed as @xmath79 and @xmath80 is zero . in the condition with @xmath81 and @xmath82 ,",
    "the cpr @xmath83 becomes @xmath79 @xmath84 .",
    "the feature of this cpr is the same as that in the standard @xmath0-wave junctions without ti with the pair potential considered here .",
    "however , as the magnetization switches on , the cpr dramatically changes .",
    "figure [ fig2](b ) shows that @xmath85 gives a shift of phase difference , which is similar to @xmath22-junctions realized in conventional @xmath7-wave superconductor / ferromagnet hybrid systems @xcite .",
    "as the magnetization along @xmath86 or @xmath87-axis appears , the qualitative features of cpr of symmetric @xmath88/fi/@xmath15 and @xmath16/fi/@xmath16 junctions do not change as compared to the case without magnetization as shown in dotted and dash - dotted lines of figs .",
    "[ fig2](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "however , in the asymmetric @xmath15/fi/@xmath16 junction , the cpr is quite anomalous and the component proportional to @xmath89 is generated .",
    "we find that @xmath90 can be expressed by @xmath91 $ ] where @xmath92 is an integer , and therefore , @xmath5 becomes zero at @xmath93 as shown in solid lines in figs .",
    "[ fig2](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the present cpr is completely different from that of the standard @xmath15/fi/@xmath16 junction without ti .",
    "we can see that the term proportional to @xmath94 becomes dominant in the limit of large @xmath86 or @xmath87 in figs.[fig2](e ) and ( f ) .    to explain the anomalous cpr for nonzero @xmath86 or @xmath87 in @xmath15/fi/@xmath16 junction on ti surface , we focus on the symmetry of this hamiltonian .",
    "we consider the mirror reflection symmetry with respect to @xmath95-plane , @xmath96 , and the time - reversal symmetry , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the complex conjugation operator . in the present system",
    ", both symmetries are broken . however , since the pair potential of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is mirror even ( odd ) with respect to @xmath95-plane , @xmath99 operation produces additional phase , @xmath100 .",
    "it is also known that time reversal operation transforms @xmath90 to @xmath101 .",
    "hence , the composition operator @xmath102 will give rise to @xmath103 . taking into account the fact that @xmath104 makes the @xmath105 state to the @xmath106 one , we can arrive at @xmath107it means that @xmath108 will be satisfied at any @xmath19 if we consider the junctions between a mirror even and mirror odd pair potential . in the @xmath15/fi/@xmath16 junction with @xmath86 or @xmath87",
    ", we can find that relation ( [ symm ] ) fulfills at any @xmath19 , which indicates @xmath109 .",
    "above analysis based on mirror reflection symmetry has been applied in the josephson junctions between a singlet and triplet superconductor@xcite .",
    "now , let us look at the josephson current at @xmath12 .",
    "in the standard ds / fi / ds junctions without ti substrate , due to the spin su(2 ) symmetry , the rotation or mirror reflection of the ferromagnetism does not change the cpr and one can always find @xmath110@xcite .",
    "however , this su(2 ) symmetry is broken on ti surface due to its nature of spin - momentum locking and thus @xmath111 becomes nonzero which generates exotic @xmath4-periodic cpr @xmath112",
    ".    next , we plot the temperature dependence of the maximum josephson current @xmath113 of ds / fi / ds junctions in the left panels of fig.[fig3 ] . for simplicity ,",
    "only the @xmath114 component of magnetization @xmath87 is considered .",
    "we concentrate on the low temperature region @xmath115 in which the behavior of @xmath113 is highly influenced by the zero - energy states ( zess ) .",
    "therefore , we display the surface density of states at the edge of ds .",
    "it is obtained by calculating the ldos @xmath116 $ ] at the ds / fi interface in the ds / fi / n junction as illustrated in fig.[fig1](b ) . from fig.[fig3](a ) , we can see that temperature dependence of @xmath113 in @xmath15/fi/@xmath88 junctions changes from kulik - omelyanchuk ( k - o)@xcite type to ambegaokar - baratoff ( a - b)@xcite type with decreasing @xmath87 .",
    "however , in @xmath16/fi/@xmath16 junction , this tendency is reversed when we decrease @xmath87 , as shown in fig.[fig3](c ) . as seen from figs.[fig3](b ) and",
    "( d ) , we can see that as ldos at zero energy is enhanced , temperature dependence of @xmath113 is reduced to be the k - o type . in other case , it is in the a - b type .",
    "since the spin degeneracy is lifted on the surface states of ti by spin momentum locking , we obtain the highly asymmetric yu - shiba - rusinov type of ldos @xcite in the @xmath15/fi interface . this finding is similar to that in the @xmath7-wave superconductor / fi / n junction@xcite .",
    "recent experiments have shown that the induced energy gap by high @xmath9 cuprate on the surface of ti is almost isotropic@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to clarify the role of the induced @xmath7-wave pair potential on ds / fi / ds junctions . in this section ,",
    "we calculate josephson current in @xmath7+@xmath0-wave / fi/@xmath7+@xmath0-wave junctions on ti .",
    "the pair potential is @xmath117 with @xmath118 on the left(right ) side .",
    "the ratio @xmath119 is chosen to be @xmath120 so that the system is @xmath7-wave dominant and fully gapped .",
    "the obtained @xmath5 has a typical sinusoidal shape of @xmath7-wave josephson current where the first order coupling @xmath121 plays the predominant role . because of",
    "the @xmath7-wave component of pair potential , the mirror reflection symmetry @xmath104 at @xmath122 is broken and thus nonzero current @xmath123 can be expected .",
    "also , in the presence of @xmath86 or @xmath87 , we find a nonzero josephson current at @xmath124 @xmath125 in such junctions .",
    "the obtained anomalous cpr in the @xmath7+@xmath0-wave josephson junctions can be used to probe the @xmath0-wave component of the induced pair potential on ti surface .",
    "for example , one can observe the supercurrent flow without macroscopic phase difference in @xmath7+@xmath15/fi/@xmath7+@xmath16 junctions . as seen in fig.[fig6 ] , the existence of @xmath0-wave component generates a nonzero current @xmath111 when one turns on either @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "in summary , we have theoretically studied the josephson effect in @xmath0-wave superconductor - ferromagnet insulator ( fi ) hybrids on the surface of ti . depending on the orientation of the magnetization in fi , the exotic current - phase relation which violates @xmath126",
    "have been obtained in two different ways : ( i ) through a simple phase shift and ( ii ) mixture of @xmath127 term into the original cpr .",
    "the latter case can generate the exotic current - phase relation @xmath128 with @xmath4 periodicity .",
    "we show that the josephson current is enhanced due to the zero energy states on the edge of @xmath0-wave superconductor . for comparison with actual experiments ,",
    "we calculate the josephson current when both @xmath7- and @xmath0-wave pair potentials exist .",
    "the anomalous current - phase relation is also found which provides a way to probe the fingerprint of @xmath0-wave pair potential in high-@xmath9 cuprate / ti heterostructures .",
    "our preliminary theoretical investigation has practical significance for controlling the josephson current and designing new functional devices .",
