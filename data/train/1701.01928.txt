    "the proliferation of mobile smart devices has promoted the development of mobile crowdsensing systems ( mcss ) , a promising paradigm for agile , fine - grained , and economical sensing with prominent spatial - temporal coverage @xcite .",
    "exploring people - centric data collected by smart devices with enriched sensors ( _ e.g. _ global positioning system , gyroscope and microphone ) , a growing number of mcs prototypes have been developed to support applications , including urban sensing @xcite , environmental monitoring @xcite and mobile social networking @xcite .    observing that the data source of mcss is a set of personal mobile devices",
    "temporally recruited , the self - interested nature of mobile users needs to be taken into account for mcs implementations . from the perspective of mobile users considering the potential costs ( _ e.g. _ physical labor , device battery life , and network bandage usage )",
    ", participation is unlikely in an mcs sensing task unless there was a considerable payback under the rational person hypothesis . from the perspective of the mcs server ,",
    "the credibility of reported observations from temporally recruited users is not guaranteed ( _ i.e. _ users may cheat in sensing tasks just for the payback without reporting quality data , which is referred to as cheating behavior in this paper ) , even when it pays fairly for data acquisition .",
    "intuitively , we can see that : ( i ) the mcs server needs to recruit credible users in sensing tasks , and ( ii ) honest responses deserve substantial reward while dishonest reporting requires reprimand .",
    "a mechanism satisfying these two requirements simultaneously is necessary for mcs implementations .",
    "user incentive schemes @xcite aim at encouraging self - interested users to participate in system tasks by rewarding monetary or tradable paybacks . generally speaking , existing schemes in participatory systems model the user incentive process as an optimization problem for either the system server @xcite or users @xcite by designing mechanisms based on auction or game theory",
    ". nonetheless , research on incentive mechanisms that considers active cheating behaviors from self - interested users is relatively limited .",
    "schemes in @xcite and @xcite aim to guarantee the ` bidder s truthfulness ' in designed auctions .",
    "also , incentive schemes were proposed to evaluate the quality of user reports @xcite .",
    "however , these schemes can not be directly deployed in highly dynamic and opportunistic mcss . to stimulate the service time of mcs participators , a stackelberg game - based incentive mechanism is proposed in @xcite , which maximizes the utility of the mcs platform and proves that a best strategy for all self - interested participators can be centrally determined . however , since the purpose of this work is to stimulate user participation , and no sensing data quality related factor is considered , it can not solve the dishonest user reporting issue .",
    "an incentive mechanism that encourages quality data reporting is necessary to guarantee the usability of mcss .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a novel cheating - resilient incentive ( cri ) scheme for mcss , which guarantees the accuracy of crowdsensing tasks while encouraging mobile users to provide quality data without cheating for maximum paybacks .",
    "our contributions are summarized as follows :    * based on the participation - driven incentivization in @xcite , we develop a reputation - driven method for the mcs server to recruit the most credible users autonomously according to their historical behaviors . meanwhile , recruited users can obtain maximum paybacks only when they contribute no less than expected .",
    "we demonstrate the correctness of our design with theoretical analysis . *",
    "we introduce the truth discovery technique @xcite into the user incentive issue to evaluate the actual contribution of recruited users in mcs tasks .",
    "the adaptive truth discovery guarantees the accuracy of crowdsensing while providing a baseline for user contribution evaluation . * through extensive trace - driven simulations , we evaluate the performance of cri .",
    "the simulation results validate the effectiveness of cri with respect to both quality - driven user stimulation and cheating behavior resistance .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : modeling ] , we present the mcs model and the description of the user incentive problem . in section  [ sec :",
    "scheme ] , we present the cri scheme in detail . in section  [ sec :",
    "evaluation ] , we present the evaluation results of our designed scheme via extensive trace - driven simulations . finally , we conclude this paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : systemarc ] , a general mcs consists of a cloud server @xmath0 and a set of registered mobile users @xmath1 , where @xmath2 .",
    "any user @xmath3 can communicate with @xmath0 via either cellular or wifi access points .    for a specific sensing target",
    ", @xmath0 can announce a task @xmath4 to all users in @xmath5 . receiving the announcement ,",
    "any user @xmath3 who is interested in @xmath4 can reply with its reputation @xmath6 as an application , which reflects its behavior in historical tasks . according to all applications received",
    ", @xmath0 can determine the total reward @xmath7 and the set of applicants @xmath8 to be the final employees of @xmath4 .",
    "all employees @xmath9 then conduct sensing obligations required by @xmath4 and report their observations @xmath10 to @xmath0 .",
    "based on all reports received , @xmath0 can discover @xmath4 s sensing truth @xmath11 , and evaluate the contribution @xmath12 of all employees separately , which determines their paybacks @xmath13 for @xmath4 and corresponding reputation adjustments .",
    "the purpose of incentive mechanisms in mcss is to stimulate mobile user activity through paybacks for participating in sensing tasks . as the decision maker",
    ", @xmath0 prefers to maximize paybacks of the most contributive users as stimulation , while minimizing the effect of potential cheating behaviors ( _ e.g. _ intentionally reporting random data just for the payback ) , to achieve accurate sensing .    to guarantee the quality of sensing reports , @xmath0 needs to consider two issues : ( i ) the selection of employees for a given task should be based on the applicant s reputation , and ( ii ) the reputation adjustment and payback to an employee should be based on their contribution in the current task .",
    "therefore , our user incentive scheme should solve the following problems :    1 .   how to define and manage the user reputation ?",
    "2 .   how to recruit employees based on their reputations ? 3 .   how to evaluate an employee s contribution ? 4 .   how to quantify and maximize an employee s payback",
    "according to its contribution ?",
    "in this section , we develop the cheating - resilient incentive ( cri ) scheme to address the four problems outlined in subsection  [ subsec : problem ] . before the construction of cri",
    ", we first provide the formal definitions of both _ user reputation _ and _ employee payback_. then , we present a mechanism for reputation - driven employee recruitment .",
    "after that , we address the issue of how to evaluate an employee s contribution and how to quantify and maximize an employee s payback according to its contribution .      in this paper ,",
    "we formally define user reputation and employee payback as follows .",
    "* user reputation : * intuitively , we treat the reputation as a user s credibility for offering quality reports . in fact",
    ", once recruited , the user is responsible for providing an actual contribution to the sensing task in proportion to its reputation .    for any mobile user",
    "@xmath14 , the reputation of @xmath15 , denoted as @xmath6 ( @xmath16 ) , will be adjusted by @xmath0 whenever @xmath15 participates in a sensing task @xmath4 by @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the reputation of @xmath15 before it participates in @xmath4 , @xmath19 denotes @xmath15 s expected contribution to @xmath4 ( estimated by @xmath0 considering @xmath18 , discussed latter ) , @xmath20 denotes @xmath15 s actual contribution to @xmath4 ( evaluated by @xmath0 , discussed latter ) , and @xmath21 determines the sensitivity of @xmath15 s reputation adjustment .",
    "after the user s registration , @xmath0 issues any @xmath14 a value @xmath22 as its initial reputation .",
    "* employee payback : * intuitively , it is natural to determine an employee s payback according to its contribution .",
    "also , considering that the reputation of an employee only denotes the probability of its good behavior , we take the potential quality risk into account for the payback determination .    inspired by the sensing time - driven model in @xcite , for an employee @xmath23 of task @xmath4 , we define its reputation - driven payback @xmath24 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the total reward of @xmath4 . for a fixed @xmath7 , @xmath24",
    "is subjected to both the ratio of @xmath15 s contribution , @xmath27 , and the potential quality risk for recruiting @xmath15 , @xmath28 .",
    "based on the definitions above , we develop cri , which consists of three components : ( i ) _ employee recruitment _ , ( ii ) _ contribution evaluation _ , and ( iii ) _ payback determination_.      ' '' ''    put @xmath29 in descending order @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32    we now address the issue of how to recruit employees based on their reputations . after the announcement of task @xmath4 , receiving all applications",
    "@xmath33 ( see subsection   [ subsec : mcsarchitecture ] ) , @xmath0 prefers to recruit employees with top reputations .",
    "nonetheless , according to equation  ( [ eq : payback ] ) , it is possible that an applicant could obtain no payback if the total reward budget is low .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 needs to determine the final employees considering their expected paybacks @xmath34 , which are determined by their expected contributions @xmath35 .    for effective stimulations ,",
    "it is necessary for @xmath0 to maximize the expected payback that a well - behaving employee can have . according to equation  ( [ eq : payback ] ) , it is easy to get that @xmath24 is second - order continuous differentiable on @xmath19 , and the second derivative of @xmath24 on @xmath19 is :    @xmath36    when @xmath37",
    ", there is @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is a concave function .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 has a unique maximum value when @xmath40 .",
    "we call such a value @xmath41 as @xmath15 s expected payback , which can be calculated whenever @xmath42 has a solution .    therefore , from the perspective of @xmath0 , any @xmath3 that is finally recruited should satisfy following restrictions :    @xmath43    to allow @xmath0 to autonomously recruit as many credible users as possible with a fixed total reward , we develop algorithm  [ alg : recruit ] based on the ne computation algorithm in the std game @xcite to determine final employees just based on their reputations . here , all employees recruited will have the maximum payback only if they contribute as expected .",
    "according to @xcite , we have propositions 1 and 2 for algorithm  [ alg : recruit ] as follows",
    ".    * proposition 1 . * _ any @xmath3 that is not recruited by algorithm [ alg : recruit ] gets the maximum payback by not participating in @xmath4 . _    * proposition 2 . *",
    "_ any @xmath23 that is recruited by algorithm [ alg : recruit ] can obtain the maximum payback only if it contributes as expected in @xmath4 . _",
    "because of the page limitation , please refer to theorem 1 and 2 in @xcite for specific proofs .    until now",
    ", @xmath0 can recruit the most credible employees @xmath44 and compute their expected contributions @xmath45 only based on all received applications @xmath46 , and @xmath45 is treated as one of the metrics for the payback determination .      in the following ,",
    "we address the issue of how to evaluate an employee s contribution .",
    "after employee recruitment , @xmath0 announces a detailed task description of @xmath4 to all @xmath23 .",
    "the employees then reply corresponding reports containing their observations @xmath10 .",
    "based on @xmath47 , @xmath0 discovers the sensing truth @xmath11 , and evaluates the actual contributions @xmath12 of all @xmath23 .",
    "because there is no ground truth in our mcs scenario , @xmath0 needs to discover the sensing truth @xmath11 , based on @xmath47 , as the baseline to evaluate employees actual contributions .",
    "considering the potential conflict in reported observations and the difference in employee reputations , we develop algorithm  [ alg : sensingtruthdiscovery ] based on the general truth discovery framework in @xcite to allow @xmath0 to compute @xmath11 and to evaluate actual employee contributions @xmath48 at the same time .    according to algorithm  [ alg : sensingtruthdiscovery ] , each actual contribution @xmath49 is subjected to both the distance between @xmath50 and @xmath11 , and @xmath15 s reputation @xmath6 .",
    "we treat observations from employees with higher reputations as more credible , and an employee s contribution will be higher if its observation is closer to @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath48 is treated as another metric for the payback determination .    ' '' ''    compute the standard deviation of @xmath47 : @xmath51 initialize @xmath11 as a random value initialize @xmath52 as @xmath53      we now answer the question about how to quantify and maximize an employee s payback according to its contribution .",
    "based on the expected contributions @xmath45 and the actual contributions @xmath48 , @xmath0 can determine the final paybacks @xmath13 for all @xmath23 , and update employees reputations @xmath54 according to their behaviors in @xmath4 .",
    "for all @xmath23 , to compare @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we set the total reward @xmath55 to guarantee that @xmath19 is within the range of @xmath56 $ ] .    according to equation  ( [ eq : payback ] ) , we set @xmath57    also , according to equation  ( [ eq : reputation ] ) , @xmath0 updates all @xmath58 as : @xmath59    as demonstrated , cri guarantees that ( i ) @xmath0 can recruit a proper number of the most credible applicants for sensing tasks , and ( ii ) recruited users can only obtain the maximum paybacks when they contribute no less than expected .",
    "cheating behaviors will reduce their paybacks and opportunities of being recruited in future tasks .",
    "to validate the performance of cri in real - world mcss , we conducted extensive trace - driven simulations based on omnet++ 4.6 , using real - world outdoor temperature data collected by taxis in rome ( hereinafter referred to as rometrace ) @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we first present the simulation settings , and then show the evaluation results .      according to rometrace",
    ", we constructed an mcs with a cloud server and 366 registered users .",
    "all users possessed outdoor temperature data opportunistically collected within @xmath60 hours .",
    "the server spontaneously announced temperature sensing tasks to the users . after receiving an announcement ,",
    "a user who possessed data collected within @xmath61 seconds autonomously applied for the task , and then uploaded corresponding report if it was recruited .",
    "the server provided paybacks and updated employee reputations based on cri during the simulation .    for the parameter settings , we set the initial reputation @xmath62 and @xmath63 in equation  ( [ eq : reputation ] ) for reasonable reputation bootstrapping and management .",
    "in addition , we set @xmath64 in algorithm  [ alg : sensingtruthdiscovery ] as the truth discovery convergence threshold",
    ". again , according to rometrace , each round of simulation lasts for @xmath65 simulation seconds .",
    "we collected the following four metrics to evaluate the impact of cheating behaviors$ ] ( according to rometrace ) . ] on the mcs performance :    * * discovered truth ( dt ) * refers to the sensing truth discovered in a task , whose cumulative distribution reflects the sensing accuracy .",
    "ideally , cri should be able to prevent cheating behaviors from disrupting dt ; * * reputation ( rep ) * refers to the user reputation , whose cumulative distribution reflects the user s behavior in historical tasks .",
    "ideally , cri should be able to downgrade a cheater s rep in proportion to its cheating intensity ; * * payback ( pb)$ ] for effective comparisons . ] * refers to what a user receives for accomplishing sensing tasks , which reflects the motivation of the user participating in future tasks .",
    "ideally , cri should be able to reduce the pb that a user can get if it cheats ; * * task count ( tc ) * refers to the number of sensing tasks accomplished by a user , which reflects the popularity of the user .",
    "ideally , cri should be able to limit the probability of a cheater participating in mcs tasks .    for comparison , we ran a round of simulation without any cheating behavior as the baseline ( _ i.e. _ the no cheating scenario ) .",
    "then , we analyzed the impact of cheating behaviors introduced by users with different properties . in following subsections",
    ", we depict the simulation results using either the cumulative distribution figure ( cdf ) or the time - variance figure ( tvf ) for a distinct demonstration .      in this set of simulations , to study the impact of general cheating behaviors with different intensities",
    ", we set all users in the mcs to introduce cheating behaviors with different probabilities ( _ i.e. _ 10% , 15% and 20% ) in all sensing tasks .",
    "the simulation result is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ratio ] .    according to figure  [ fig :",
    "ratio](a ) , compared with the baseline scenario , the cumulative distribution of dt remains almost the same in all cheating scenarios .",
    "we can see that a disturbance on the average dt no more than @xmath66 ( _ i.e. _ 0.4 ) is introduced by general cheating behaviors with an intensity up to @xmath67 .",
    "such an impact is nearly negligible considering the practical temperature sensing requirement .",
    "cri manages to effectively restrict the impact of general cheating behaviors on dt in both realistic and even harsher scenarios .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : ratio](b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , when the cheating intensity increases , user s reputation , payback , and task count are correspondingly downgraded for at least @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "cri manages to reduce the cheater s probability of being recruited in future tasks by reducing its reputation and payback autonomously , which will inherently restrict user s cheating intention .      in real - world mcss ,",
    "cheating behaviors of more trustworthy or active users may pose deeper impacts on the mcs s performance . in this set of simulations , depending on the simulation result of the baseline scenario , we separately set a user that ( i ) had the highest reputation ( referred to as the topr cheater ) , ( ii ) received the most paybacks ( referred to as the topp cheater ) , and ( iii ) accomplished the most tasks ( referred to as the topc cheater ) to introduce cheating behaviors either consistently ( _ i.e. _ cheat with a 100% probability ) or intermittently ( _ i.e. _ cheat with a 50% probability ) .",
    "the simulation results are illustrated in figures  [ fig : topr ] , [ fig : topp ] , and  [ fig : topc ] .",
    "* topr cheater : * according to figure  [ fig : topr ] , neither the consistent nor the intermittent cheating of the topr cheater caused obvious impact on dt ( introduced disturbances of @xmath71 and @xmath72 on the average dt , respectively ) .",
    "nonetheless , in comparison with the baseline scenario , rep of the topr cheater was downgraded as long as there was cheating behavior ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 lower , respectively ) .",
    "correspondingly , both pb ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 less , respectively ) and tc ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 less , respectively ) of the topr cheater decreased .",
    "* topp cheater : * according to figure  [ fig : topp ] , neither consistent nor intermittent cheating behaviors of the topp cheater caused obvious impact on dt ( introduced disturbances of @xmath79 and @xmath80 on the average dt , respectively ) .",
    "meanwhile , rep of the topp cheater ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 lower , respectively ) was significantly downgraded .",
    "it s pb ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 less , respectively ) and tc ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 less , respectively ) declined dramatically because of cheating .",
    "* topc cheater : * according to figure  [ fig : topc ] , dt was obviously affected by neither consistent nor intermittent cheating behaviors of the topc cheater ( introduced disturbances of @xmath87 and @xmath88 on the average dt , respectively ) . in turn , it s rep ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 lower , respectively ) was severely downgraded in cheating scenarios .",
    "also , pb ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 less , respectively ) and tc ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 less , respectively ) decreased significantly .",
    "according to the results above , it is well demonstrated that cri manages to encourage users to report honestly ( with their best efforts ) in sensing tasks for higher payback , reputation , and recruiting opportunities in practical mcss .",
    "in this paper , we developed cri for mcss to guarantee crowdsensing accuracy by encouraging mobile users to provide quality data without cheating for the maximum paybacks . to be specific",
    ", cri enables mcs server to autonomously recruit as many as credible users as task employees , and employees will obtain the maximum payback only if they contribute honestly as their reputations indicate . via theoretical analysis , we demonstrated the feasibility and correctness of our design .",
    "to evaluate the performance of cri in practical mcss , we conducted extensive simulations based on real - world crowdsensing data .",
    "the results show that cri manages to guarantee the sensing accuracy under realistic cheating intensities ( up to 20% of total reports ) .",
    "meanwhile , cheating behaviors from users with selected advantages ( _ i.e. _ higher reputations , more received paybacks , and more accomplished tasks ) can be effectively resisted as well .",
    "our future work is to develop a privacy - preserving cri , which encourages honest user behaviors without jeopardizing sensitive user information including identities , locations , and living patterns .",
