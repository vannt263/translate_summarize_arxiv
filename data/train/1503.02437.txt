    "prominent examples include superconducting waveguide cavities or mechanical resonators coupled to cold atoms @xcite , polar molecules @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , as well as other solid - state spin systems @xcite .",
    "a key challenge in the field of hybrid quantum systems is the realization of a controlled interface between a superconducting circuit and a _ single _ solid - state spin qubit .",
    "it would allow the realization of long - lived quantum memories for superconducting qubits , without the big problem of inhomogeneous broadening encountered in spin ensembles @xcite . however , the direct magnetic coupling between a single spin and a single microwave photon is typically only a few hz @xcite , much smaller than the relevant decoherence rates . to overcome this problem",
    "it has been proposed to enhance this coupling via an intermediate persistent current loop @xcite , but the decoherence rates of such small superconducting loops are still unknown and will to a large extent compensate the achievable increase in coupling strength .    in this work we propose and analyze a practical design for a coherent quantum interface between a single spin qubit and a microwave resonator , which makes use of the recent advances in the fabrication of single - crystal diamond nanoresonators . over the past years",

    "1 ) . compared to previously considered capacitive coupling schemes @xcite usually employed in cavity electromechanics @xcite , we here consider the case where the coupling between the quantized motion of the diamond beam and the microwave cavity photons results from the dielectric interaction a fundamental mechanism that any polarizable body placed in an inhomogeneous electric field will experience a dielectric force .",
    "this dielectric coupling has been employed in the classical regime for on - chip actuation of thin mechanical beams @xcite and is scalable to large arrays of diamond mechanical resonators . for the present purpose of a quantum interface",
    "it is important that this dielectric coupling is fully controlled by a tunable driving field , but opposed to the capacitive coupling @xcite , it results in large photon - phonon interactions without driving the cavity mode itself . when combined with a magnetic spin - phonon interaction in the presence of a strong magnetic field gradient @xcite , a tunable coupling for exchanging a quantum state between the single spin memory and the superconducting microwave cavity can be implemented .",
    "we show that under realistic conditions the resulting effective interactions between a single spin qubit and a single microwave photon can exceed 10khz , roughly three orders of magnitude stronger than the direct coupling .",
