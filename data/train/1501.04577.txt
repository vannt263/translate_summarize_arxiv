    "the research of phenomena related to light - matter interaction has been experiencing significant growth for the past decade @xcite in the domain of nano - optics . from the fundamental point of view ,",
    "one of the most intriguing question lies in the dynamics and in the optical properties of many - body systems .",
    "for instance , new collective modes were predicted and measured in materials composed of interacting quantum emitters ( atoms , molecules , etc . )",
    "experiments in that regard are noticeably advanced compared to theory , as it has long been realized that treating multi - body systems is quite challenging .",
    "even systems comprised of just a few interacting quantum dipoles are difficult to investigate @xcite .",
    "semi - classical descriptions of light - matter interaction , in which a classical electric field interacts with a quantum system , enormously simplify modeling leading to results that both support experiments and predict new phenomena @xcite",
    ".    collective effects @xcite arise from the fact that the electric field experienced by an arbitrary quantum emitter is the sum of both the applied field and the radiation from all other atoms in the system under consideration",
    ". when it is strong enough , the radiation from the dipoles set them coupled .",
    "this is the source of cooperativity .",
    "one of the important fundamental cooperative effects , the collective lamb shift which is due to the exchange of virtual photons between the particles in a dense sample of atoms was recently observed @xcite .",
    "dependent of the cooperativeness in homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems were studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . at present ,",
    "research on those cooperative effects concerns on both cold @xcite and thermal @xcite samples of atoms since they offer the observation of different interesting quantum phenomena . because of the ability of light to carry effectively quantum information , understanding the optical response and the light scattering in dense samples is also interesting for many applications such as slow and stopped light @xcite , quantum information @xcite , trapped light @xcite and optical memories @xcite .    in the linear regime ,",
    "the propagation of light through any medium can be investigated by extracting its electric susceptibility @xcite .",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that the electric susceptibility of systems comprised of three level quantum emitters at high densities exhibit a fano - type profile that results in a new phenomenon of induced transparency called _ dipole induced electromagnetic transparency _ ( diet ) .",
    "diet is due to the collective response of the system towards the external electromagnetic ( em ) field via dipole - dipole interactions . following this work , in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed theory of diet and extend the model to multilevel systems .",
    "we also apply our theory to a realistic system , namely the d1 line of @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section discusses in detail our theoretical description for @xmath1-level systems and the analytic model used to analyze the results .",
    "section [ two - levels ] provides results and a comprehensive discussion of how linear optical properties of a system comprised of interacting two - level emitters depends on various material parameters such as the particle density . in section",
    "[ many - levels ] , we extend our discussion to systems having more than one excited states .",

    "section [ applications ] discusses possible applications of our results and finally , we conclude our work in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "our goal is to describe the linear dynamics of quantum emitters in a self - consistent manner taking into account collective effects .",
    "the most comprehensive and thus complete description would be to implement a fully quantum model based on the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the quasi - classical theory of light - matter interaction recently applied to hybrid materials has proven to lead to both qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiments @xcite . keeping also in mind that the majority of experiments in nano - optics , such as white light spectroscopy , for instance , are performed under conditions corresponding to high occupation numbers of photons in a given em mode , the quasi - classical description is well justified .",
    "the idea is to separate the description of em waves from the dynamics of quantum emitters considering the spatio - temporal evolution of em radiation using classical maxwell s equations while applying the full machinery of quantum mechanics to describe the response of quantum emitters to em excitation .",
    "this results in a system of coupled maxwell - bloch equations @xcite . if one wants to observe collective effects , it is imperative to solve the corresponding equations of motion self - consistently without any decoupling @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the em field components , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , is simulated using maxwell s equations    [ maxwell ] @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the permittivity and the permeability of free space , respectively , and @xmath7 is the macroscopic polarization of the system at position @xmath8 and time @xmath9 .",

    "it is due to the mismatching between the slab thickness @xmath89 nm and the transition wavelength @xmath161 nm that creates long tails of fabry - prot modes near the reflection window which modify the transmission probability ( see fig .",

    "the presence of additional levels such as ro - vibrational levels in molecules for instance or multiple optically active electronic states in case of atoms can change the response of the system due to the presence of additional energetically allowed transition dipoles which leave their signatures as spectral holes in the reflection spectrum and as narrow transmission peaks in the transmission spectrum .",
