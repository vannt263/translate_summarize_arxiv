    "rare - earth manganites of the form @xmath1mno@xmath2 ( where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is a rare - earth ( alkaline - earth ) element ) are typical representatives of complex oxides with multi - orbital interactions and a strong competition between spin , charge , orbital , and phononic degrees of freedom.@xcite in these materials the main competition is between the delocalization tendency of the @xmath0 electrons and the localization effects caused by the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) coupling between the mn @xmath5 spins as well as the jahn - teller effects.@xcite the delicate balance between these competing tendencies produces a very rich phase diagram . intrinsic or external perturbations that naively may seem `` weak '' , such as small variations in the carrier density , pressure , magnetic fields , and quenched disorder , can nevertheless induce nonlinear effects , including phase transitions due to the close proximity in energy of the competing states .",
    "this high sensitivity to perturbations is clear in manganites with composition @xmath6 , where several competing ground states with quite different properties , such as ferromagnetic as well as ce and a - type afm states , have been identified.@xcite among them , the ce state is known to appear in several narrow - bandwidth manganites .",
    "this complex state is formed by zigzag fm chains with afm inter - chain coupling , and its stabilization is usually accompanied by a checkerboard pattern of charge and orbital order , which further stabilizes the ce spin structure .",
    "@xcite    metal - insulator transitions ( mit ) are familiar phenomena in condensed matter physics . for a normal metal , the addition of quenched disorder leads to the trapping of mobile carriers and transforms a metal into an insulator",
    ". however , for manganites the _ reversed _ process usually occurs , in situations where quenched disorder originates from chemical substitution or intrinsic defects.@xcite usually , two sources of quenched - disorder effects in manganites are considered .",
    "one is primarily caused by the a - site disorder ( alloy randomness),@xcite while the other is induced by b(mn)-site substitution .",
    "@xcite theoretically , the a - site disorder effects have been extensively studied in the past few years .",
    "bond disorder and on - site potential disorder were jointly or separately introduced to model various a - site disorder sources . @xcite the quantitative calculations indicate that the fm metal phase is not much affected by the a - site disorder , while the ce / co insulator easily collapses into a glassy - like state .",
    "conceptually , and differently from the a - site disorder , the b - site substitution induces disorder locally directly into the mn - o network and it may modulate quantities such as @xmath7 , the @xmath0 electron - density .",
    "therefore , the b - site substitution can have stronger impact on the physical properties of the material than the a - site disorder .",
    "experiments show that a few percent b - site substitution , such as chemical substitution of mn by cr / al / ga / ru in the half - doped ce state of manganites , will favor a phase separated ( ps ) state with fm tendencies , although these ions are different in their electronic structure and have different magnetic coupling with the mn ions .",
    "@xcite for the nonmagnetic substitution , for instance , @xmath8 al substitution in pr@xmath9ca@xmath9mno@xmath2 is sufficient to convert the charge - ordered ( co ) ce insulator into a state with fm metallic characteristics.@xcite these experimental results are very surprising since ( 1 ) the substituting ions al / ga are nonmagnetic , and ( 2 ) the al / ga doping leads to the reduction of the @xmath0 electron density , both of which are disadvantageous for the fm tendency.@xcite in fact , such a reduction of the @xmath0 electron density is expected to favor an afm insulating state.@xcite    very recently , the disorder effects by b - site substitution were also investigated within the context of the two - orbital double - exchange ( de ) model.@xcite the observed collapse of the ce / co phase into a fm phase was explained in terms of a density - driven phase - separation .",
    "the main idea is that the impurity , having a @xmath10 valence , transfers extra electrons to the remaining mn sites.@xcite thus , in this context it is straightforward to understand the fm tendency since @xmath0 densities larger than half , @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 , usually are associated with fm phases in manganites .",
    "however , this density - driven phase - separation idea can not explain the experimental fact that _ trivalent _ substitutions , such as cr / al / ga , are expected to reduce the @xmath0 electron density on the remaining mn - site ( @xmath11@xmath14@xmath13 ) rather than increasing this density .",
    "this reduction of the @xmath0 density is quite nontrivial since the electronic density is one of the most important factors to determine the ground state , especially around the half - doping region .",
    "in fact , the previous theoretical investigation predicted that al / ga would @xmath15 lead to a fm tendency for half - doped manganites based on the previously described idea of a density - driven phase - separation.@xcite therefore , it is necessary to re - investigate the b - site - substitution disorder effects in half - doped manganites to understand these puzzling experimental results .",
    "in the following , we will study the effects of b - site substitution on the stability of the ce / co state .",
    "since even al / ga substitutions can induce the fm tendency , it is reasonable to consider first a non - magnetic impurity for simplicity .",
    "the main results found in this paper are that the b - site disorder can induce two main effects : ( 1 ) the lattice defects by b - site substitution break the ce - zigzag chains and frustrate the charge ordering which destabilizes the ce phase and induce the fm tendency ( the fm state is close in energy to the ce phase in half - doped manganites ) ; ( 2 ) the reduction from half - doping of the @xmath0 electron density suppresses both the long range fm and ce tendencies , since it prefers the c - afm state .",
    "these two competing effects can trigger a phase transition from the ce / co phase either into a short - range fm cluster state with relatively strong fm tendencies , or into a spin glass state . due to these competing effects , an optimal b - site substitution level for the stabilization of the fm tendency",
    "is found to exist .",
    "in our investigations , we consider a two - orbital model defined on a two - dimensional @xmath16 square lattice ( @xmath17 , and using periodic boundary conditions ) with a hamiltonian given by , @xmath18 where the first term is the two - orbital de interaction , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an @xmath0 electron with spin @xmath21 in the orbital @xmath22 ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) at site @xmath25 .",
    "the hopping amplitudes between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 for @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "the second term is the afm super - exchange ( se ) interaction between the nn @xmath5 spins @xmath31 . in the third term",
    ", the hund coupling @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) links the @xmath0 electrons with the @xmath5 spins @xmath31 ( assumed classical and normalized as @xmath34 ) . for simplicity , we consider here the hund coupling in the widely - used limit of @xmath35 .",
    "the fourth term is the electron - phonon coupling , where @xmath36 is the dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath37 are the phononic modes ( @xmath38 is for the breathing mode , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are for the jahn - teller modes ) , and @xmath41 is the orbital pseudospin operator .",
    "the fifth term in the hamiltonian is the elastic energy of the phonons.@xcite for simplicity , and as in many other previous investigations , the phonons here will actually be considered just as classical lattice distortions .",
    "@xmath42 in the last term is the chemical potential to tune the @xmath0 electron s density .    to introduce a non - magnetic impurity ( without @xmath43 electrons ) as the b - site substitution , we will assume that the impurity has no contribution to the electron conductivity and , thus , consider it as a lattice defect .",
    "thus , the de , se , and jahn - teller couplings around the impurity can be ignored , retaining only the elastic energy of local phonons .",
    "these localized defects distinguish the b - site substitution models @xcite from the a - site disorder models @xcite in which the disorder effects were applied to all sites .",
    "therefore , the topological structure of the lattice defects , which is absent in a - site disorder cases , is especially important in patterning the electron configuration of the original ce / co state .",
    "our model hamiltonian eq .",
    "( 1 ) is studied via a combination of exact diagonalization and monte carlo ( mc ) techniques : classical @xmath5 spins and phonons evolve following the mc procedure ; and at each mc step , the fermionic sector of the hamiltonian is numerically exactly diagonalized .",
    "the first @xmath44 mc steps are used for thermal equilibrium and another @xmath45 mc steps are used for measurements .",
    "more details about this widely - used two - orbital hamiltonian and the mc algorithm can be found in ref .  .",
    "in the present calculation , first we considered averages over several defect configurations .",
    "however , we observed that for a dilute distribution of defects , namely with defects not in close proximity to each other , the results of the calculations are almost the same for different configurations .",
    "therefore , here only two defect configurations were used for each parameter point in most simulations , except for the cases of the phase diagram and density - of - states ( dos ) for which only one configuration was used .",
    "in addition , since defects should have the same probability to occupy the two types of sites in the ce phase , the bridge sites ( b1 ) and corner sites ( b2),@xcite the same number of defects on these b1 and b2 sites are arranged in our @xmath46 lattice .",
    "the @xmath46 lattice is enough to describe the prominent phenomena of the b - site substitution , such as the destabilization of the ce order , the phase separation , and the fm tendency , since the lattice size effects are mild in these phenomena.@xcite all the simulations are performed at a low - temperature fixed at @xmath47=@xmath48 , which is low enough to describe ground state properties . to characterize different spin orders ,",
    "the spin structure factors are calculated by performing fourier transforms of the real - space correlation functions.@xcite",

    "this phase diagram in the ( @xmath50 , @xmath36 ) plane can be divided into three main regimes . when both @xmath50 and @xmath36 are small , the de interaction dominates and favors the fm metallic state ( regime denoted by `` fm '' ) .",
    "with increasing @xmath50 , i.e. enhanced se interaction , an appropriate combination of @xmath50 and @xmath36 leads to the ce / co insulating state ( regime `` ce / co '' ) .",
    "moreover , there exists a parameter - space region with coexisting fm order and charge order ( regime `` fm / co '' ) where @xmath50 is small and @xmath36 is large .",

    "the other two plateaus correspond to two other phases : the fm state at @xmath56 and the c - type afm state at @xmath57 , indicating the importance of the charge - density variation in driving the phase transition .",
    "the transitions between the three phases are abrupt when varying the chemical potential @xmath42 , suggesting density - variation - driven first - order phase transitions , at least in the small clusters we have studied in this effort.@xcite      now let us investigate the effect of b - site nonmagnetic substitution in manganites of the form @xmath58mn@xmath59o@xmath2 .",
    "such a substitution will lead to the appearance of lattice defects and , simultaneously , a variation of the @xmath0 electron density . to clarify their respective roles , here",

    "for such purpose , the substituting cations are assumed to be @xmath60 in charge to keep the average @xmath0 charge density for the remaining mn - sites ( @xmath11 ) invariant , i.e. @xmath61 .",
    "we have observed that for a given appropriate substitution level @xmath62 , the ce / co state will turn into a state with strong fm tendency .",

    "considering first the magnetic order , the ce phase consists of zigzag fm chains that are easily cut down by lattice defects , leading to a substantial increase in the kinetic energy .",
    "however , the competing fm phase has a two - dimensional ( three - dimensional in real case ) character , which is much more robust against lattice defects . for a pure system the jahn - teller coupling favors the long - range staggered co pattern . in real cases , the b - site substitution should be randomly distributed between the b1 sites ( with higher charge density ) and b2 sites ( with lower charge density with the same probabilities .",
    "this randomness of b - site substitution can break the original co state , causing charge frustration .",

    "the intuitive idea described in the previous paragraph can be examined by means of a crude calculation : the phonons ( classical distortions ) are allowed to evolve freely in the mc sequence , while the @xmath5 spin background is _ frozen _ into either the fm or ce patterns .",

    "this crude calculation illustrates the asymmetric impact of lattice defects on the stability of the two phases , suggesting a possible transition from the ce / co phase to the fm phase .",

    "a substitution of @xmath62=@xmath73 clearly shrinks this gap , but still there are no states at the fermi level ( although there are some states close to it ) .",

    "this regime was described in previous publications , such as ref .  .",
    "in the more novel regime r2 , the microstructure consists of short - range fm clusters with various orientations ( fig .",
    "the charge order is suppressed in this regime ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) , and this region is here called the `` fm cluster regime '' . with increasing @xmath50 and @xmath36 , these fm clusters / domains will be separated into even smaller domains , and eventually into a spin glass state .",
    "for this regime , there is relatively strong fm tendency , and a visible drop in @xmath81 ( by varying @xmath36 or @xmath50 as shown in figs .",
    "4(b ) and ( c ) ) is observed when the parameters ( @xmath36 and @xmath50 ) cross the phase boundary between fm metallic and fm cluster regimes .",
    "in addition to their influence on the modification of the phase diagram , the lattice defects also smear the phase boundaries , implying inhomogeneous tendencies in the fm cluster state . as shown in figs .",

    "_ summarizing , _ the b - site lattice defect disorder replaces the clean - limit ce / co phase by three different regimes : ( i ) a simple extension in parameter range of the competing fm metallic phase . in figs .",
    "4(b , c ) , this regime is between the @xmath36 or @xmath50 where the original first - order jump from fm to ce in the clean limit occurs , to the clearly visible change in the slope of the @xmath81 curve ( cusp ) with further increasing couplings .",
    "( ii ) the next regime is the fm cluster state ( r2 ) , already described .",
    "( iii ) the following is the spin - glass state ( r1 ) , also described before in detail in this section .",
    "thus , we predict that half - doped manganites in the ce state could be destabilized in three different manners by b - site defects depending on how close they are to the fm metallic state in the clean - limit phase diagram . qualitatively , these results are similar to the effects caused by a - site disorder , and this similarity is a consequence of the previously unveiled fragility of the ce phase.@xcite      in the previous section , we have only considered the effects of the lattice defects introduced by the non - magnetic substitutions , which gave rise to results similar to those of previous studies that focused on a - site disorder",

    "however , the concomitant reduction of @xmath0 electron density suppresses _ both _ the fm and ce spin orders leaving behind a large inhomogeneous area that consists of coexisting short - range fm and c - afm clusters .",
    "furthermore , the competition between lattice defects and electron density reduction gives rise to an optimized substitution level for the fm tendency , qualitatively similar as found experimentally .",
    "summarizing , here we have investigated extensively the ce / co destabilization experimentally observed in half - doped manganites due to a small amount of b - site nonmagnetic substitution , by using the two - orbital double - exchange model .",
    "our calculations have shown that the ce / co phase can be easily destabilized by lattice defects , leading to a variety of interesting possible states that include the competing fm metal , or fm clusters with or without c - afm regions ( depending on the valence of the b - site substitution ) , or a spin glass state .",
    "in particular , the surprising fm tendency observed here driven by the nonmagnetic substitution into the ce state is consistent with several recent experimental results .",

    "<S> using a two - orbital model and monte carlo simulations , we investigate the effect of nonmagnetic b - site substitution on half - doped ce - type manganites . </S>",

    "<S> while a c - type antiferromagnetic state is usually associated with an average @xmath0 charge density less than 0.5 , the nonmagnetic b - site substitution that lowers the @xmath0 charge density is still found to enhance the fm tendency in our simulations . </S>",
