    "recently the atlas and cms groups reported a discovery of a new particle like the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) and the mass is near 125  gev  @xcite .",
    "this means that within the framework of the sm , the perturbation works up to the planck scale @xmath4 .",
    "it is well - known , however , that this value of mass causes the so - called stability problem of the sm vacuum .",
    "compared with the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field , @xmath5  gev , the higgs mass is relatively small and thus the higgs potential encounters instability , if we calculate the renormalization group ( rg ) improved effective potential with the running higgs quartic coupling @xmath6 up to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the renormalization scale  @xcite .",
    "if the instability occurs at @xmath9 , it may suggest an appearance of new physics below the planck scale @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the higgs potential is stable up to @xmath4 and vanishes there , an interesting possibility can be indicated that the higgs is borne at the planck scale as a scalar field with a flat potential  @xcite .",
    "another problem associated with the higgs potential is that the higgs mass receives enormous radiative corrections by , if they exist , heavy particles coupled to the higgs boson . related to this large radiative corrections to the higgs mass squared ,",
    "the naturalness problem has been vigorously examined .",
    "admittedly , the supersymmetry in the tev scale resolves the naturalness problem , but the lhc and other experiments have given strong constraints on their masses both directly and indirectly .",
    "similarly , the technicolor scenario was a beautiful idea , but it has been faced with several difficulties , the large @xmath10-parameter , the smallness of the discovered higgs mass , etc .    because of these difficulties , alternative solutions to the naturalness problem are widely discussed  @xcite these days .",
    "suppose that the uv completion theory ( which may be beyond the ordinary field theories like the string theory ) is connected with the sm sector in a way that the sm has no dimensionful parameters .",
    "then if no large intermediate mass scales exist between the sm and the uv completion theory , large logarithmic corrections violating the multiplicative renormalization of the higgs mass term are never generated : the sm becomes free from the naturalness problem .",
    "such models based on the above idea are called classically conformal models with no intermediate scales  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the classical lagrangian contains no mass terms and all dimensionful parameters are dynamically generated .",
    "motivated by the vacuum stability and the naturalness problem , we proposed a model that the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry is radiatively broken in the infrared ( ir ) region via the coleman - weinberg mechanism ( cwm )  @xcite starting from a flat scalar potential in the ultraviolet ( uv ) region  @xcite . a more radical possibility that all the scalar potentials vanish at the uv scale was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the rg flows were numerically calculated .",
    "( see also the corrigendum to @xcite . )",
    "it is , however , rather nontrivial to construct such a model because various couplings must be finely tuned so that the running scalar quartic coupling vanishes both in the ir and the uv regions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we gave a general criterion for such a scenario , which we call a `` flatland scenario '' .",
    "we showed that an inequality @xmath11 must be satisfied among the coefficients of the @xmath1 functions in order to realize the flatland .    in our previous paper  @xcite , we considered the @xmath12 model  @xcite and calculated the number @xmath2 . in this paper",
    ", we investigate a wider class of the @xmath3 extension models classified in ref .",
    "although the higgs doublets are assumed to have no charge of the extra @xmath3 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we may assign the extra @xmath3 charges to the higgs doublets so as to write the sm yukawa couplings in terms of the mass - dimension four operators . because there appears the @xmath13@xmath14 mixing in this case",
    ", the @xmath15-parameter deviates from unity at the tree level .",
    "we give a constraint on the model parameters from it .",
    "we also propose the minimal vector - like @xmath16 model for the flatland scenario , where the sm fermions do not have the @xmath16 charges and the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) in the cw sector is transferred into the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) in the sm sector by vector - like fermions having both charges of the sm and @xmath16 .",
    "this vector - like model can be connected with semi - invisible @xmath14 models widely discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we study what kind of the @xmath3 extension models can satisfy the necessary condition for the flatland scenario . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we discuss the @xmath15-parameter . in sec",
    ".  [ sec4 ] , we show realizations of the flatland scenario .",
    "[ summary ] is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "the full set of the renormalization group equations ( rges ) are shown in appendix  [ app - u1p ] and [ app - vec ] .",
    "it is well known that the cwm does not work within the sm because of the large top yukawa coupling .",
    "thus we need to extend the sm by introducing an additional sector in which the dynamical mass generation occurs .",
    "we study several extensions of the @xmath3 sector in the sm including the right - handed neutrinos @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "we also introduce the minimal vector - like @xmath16 model .",
    "let us consider a scenario that the higgs potential is totally flat at some high energy scale @xmath18 and that the extra @xmath3 breaking via the cwm is encoded into the ewsb through the quartic scalar mixing term .",
    "this flatland scenario can be realized only when a certain necessary condition is satisfied  @xcite .",
    "below we discuss whether or not the flatland scenario works in the @xmath3 extension models .",
    "it is convenient to rescale the extra @xmath3 gauge coupling @xmath19 so as to assign the charge of @xmath17 to @xmath20 .",

    "the scalar potential for @xmath22 is @xmath27 where the last @xmath28 terms are model - dependent .",

    "the last dots in @xmath33 include @xmath34 , @xmath35 , etc . , which are irrelevant in the following analysis .",
    "in order to realize the flatland scenario , the @xmath1 function for @xmath36 should satisfy @xmath37 in the ir region and simultaneously @xmath38 in the uv region .",
    "( for example , see fig.1 in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) owing to the ir fixed point of the rges  @xcite , we can encode the above inequalities of @xmath33 into the following necessary condition  @xcite , @xmath39 which is written only in terms of the coefficients of the @xmath1 functions . unless the inequality is satisfied , without any concrete calculations for the rg flows",
    ", we can conclude that the cwm does not work starting from the flat potential at the uv scale . in this sense ,",
    "the necessary condition @xmath11 is a powerful tool for the model - building . because we rescaled the extra @xmath3 charge to impose @xmath40",
