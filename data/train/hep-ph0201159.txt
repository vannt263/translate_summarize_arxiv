    "another instance of this mediation is given by the hypothesis that the ic component of @xmath19 mesons is able to explain the `` @xmath20 puzzle '' @xcite .",
    "ic can also manifest itself in processes in which the ( intrinsic ) @xmath16 produces charmed hadrons in the final state .",
    "an example of this is discussed in ref .",

    "we consider another example of the latter by looking for @xmath2 production from a @xmath16 component in the @xmath0 meson wavefunction .    to determine the process that is best suited for our purpose , we first consider purely hadronic decays of the @xmath0 meson with just one @xmath16 pair in the final state .",
    "it is then easy to see from fig .",
    "[ fig : graph0 ] , that hadronic channels with a @xmath21 quark content are also produced at tree level via @xmath22 , with no need for ic .",
    "we conclude that these processes are ill - suited to study the effects of ic , which would be swamped by a formidable background .",

    "the former has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the latter the phase space available closes rapidly , suppressing the rates to unobservable levels .",
    "this leads us to concentrate in semileptonic modes with a @xmath2 in the final state .",
    "these modes have the additional advantage of presenting an extremely clean experimental signature containing three charged leptons .",
    "the simplest mode of this type is @xmath25 . in the final state , but our analysis can also be applied to channels with other @xmath26 resonances or with @xmath27 pairs instead . ]",
    "detectors such as cdf operating at hadron machines , or experiments at @xmath0 factories such as  at slac should be able to identify the three outgoing charged leptons easily .",

    "up to now we have discussed the production of a @xmath38 state like @xmath2 in a semileptonic @xmath172 decay .",
    "we have shown that the perturbative qcd contributions to this process are extremely small , giving rise to branching ratios at the @xmath228 level .",
    "similar conclusions apply to the perturbative production of other charmonium resonances or @xmath159 pairs .",
    "we have also shown that there can be significantly larger contributions from ic components of the @xmath0-meson wavefunction .",
    "it is simple to understand why the ic contribution to our processes is much larger than the perturbative contribution .",
    "the perturbative contribution suffers from several suppression factors associated with the exchange of a perturbative gluon and the color rearrangements that are needed to convert two color octet @xmath229 pairs into color singlet mesons .",
    "the ic contribution bypasses all this because all necessary color exchanges and rearrangements take place in a nonperturbative way inside the @xmath0-meson wavefunction .",
    "the only suppression for this mechanism is then the small probability of finding the @xmath0 meson in the ic configuration .    adopting a simple spectator model and accepting recent suggestions in the literature as to the possible size of the ic component , we have estimated that @xmath230 could have a branching ratio as large as @xmath31 .",
    "we now show that at this level , the process @xmath230 could be observed in the near future .",
    "we start by estimating the sensitivity of cdf to the process @xmath231 in run ii by comparing it to @xmath232 , which they expect to see and which has the same final state . assuming 2 fb@xmath12 and 15 fb@xmath12 respectively for the integrated luminosities during run iia and run iia+run iib , and using @xcite @xmath233 leads to the estimate @xmath234 from this estimate , with @xmath235 = @xmath236 , @xmath237 , the number of events for @xmath238 is given by @xmath239 therefore",
    ", cdf could be able to use @xmath240 to test ic in the upcoming run ii . notice that the open - charm channels such as @xmath241 could also be used .",
    "our modeling of ic predicts a smaller branching ratio , of order @xmath242 .",
    "however , the identification of charged @xmath243 mesons could be up to 10 times more efficient than that of @xmath2 since the latter is reconstructed from its leptonic decay which has a small branching ratio , @xmath244 @xcite .",
    "a similar projection for  can be based on the decay @xmath245 .",
    "given the 7517 @xmath83 104 reconstructed events for @xmath246 with a total integrated luminosity of 9.7 fb@xmath12 @xcite , and a projected total luminosity of @xmath7 542 fb@xmath12 for year 2006 , we have : @xmath247 and from this we can estimate @xmath248 we have included a factor br@xmath249 to roughly account for the lower reconstructing efficiency of @xmath2 compared to @xmath250 . from these numbers",
    "we conclude that @xmath251 could be probed at the 10@xmath252 level at cdf and at the 10@xmath253 level at .",
    "similar considerations can be applied to belle .    near future experiments",
