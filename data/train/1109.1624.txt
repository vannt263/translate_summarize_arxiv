    "rbaco@xmath0o@xmath1 , ( r = rare earth elements ; 0@xmath3 1 ) type double perovskites have attracted considerable attention due to considerably high magnetoresistance associated with insulator to metal transition . a strong overlap of the unfilled , and therefore magnetic , _ 3d _ electron orbitals with oxygen",
    "_ 2p _ orbitals in these compounds makes them display strong correlation between crystallographic , magnetic and transport properties .",
    "the oxygen content can also be tailored from @xmath4 = 0 to @xmath4 = 1 by appropriate heat treatment in different atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the widely accessible oxygen nonstoichiometry and a strong tendency of oxygen vacancies to order in 112-type cobaltites , makes structural , transport and magnetic properties depend not only upon oxygen content itself , but also on the synthesis history @xcite .",
    "the role of oxygen content is crucial in this family .",
    "both , the mean valence of co ions and the oxygen coordination around co are controlled by it .",
    "the strength of the crystal field which determines the spin state of co ions depends on the type of coordination cage surrounding co ions .",
    "furthermore , according to goodenough - kanamori rules the superexchange magnetic interactions are determined by the orbital occupancy of the outermost d - electrons",
    ". consequently the magnetic and transport properties of these compounds are strongly influenced by the oxygen content and the environment of co ions .",
    "another factor that is reported to play a role in magnetic properties of these double perovskites is the ordering of oxygen vacancies .",
    "the vacancy ordering is dependent on synthesis history @xcite .",
    "it is reported that oxygen disorder favours ferromagnetic or a canted antiferromagnetic ground state .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rbaco@xmath0o@xmath5 , in particular displays a variety of interesting phenomena including metal insulator transition @xcite , spin state transition @xcite , charge ordering @xcite and giant magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure consists of layers of coo@xmath0 - bao - ro@xmath6 - coo@xmath0 stacked along the _",
    "c_-axis of an orthorhombic lattice . due to",
    "an alternation of coo@xmath7 square pyramids and coo@xmath8 octahedra along the @xmath9 axis leads to its doubling .",
    "the coo@xmath10 octahedra and coo@xmath11 pyramids in these double perovskites are found to be heavily distorted @xcite which leads to presence of variety of co@xmath12 spin states @xcite as a function of crystallographic environment and temperature .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic properties are quite complex and the compounds display both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic transitions @xcite . just below @xmath13",
    "the compounds undergo a paramagnetic ( pm ) to ferro(ferri)magnetic ( fm ) transition followed by a fm to antiferromagnetic ( afm1 ) transition which is accompanied by an onset of strong anisotropic magneto - resistive effects . the is also an afm1 to second antiferromagnetic ( amf2 ) phase transition .",
    "the mechanism of such magnetic transformations at low temperatures is still not properly understood .",
    "it is also not clear why subtle changes in oxygen content should cause drastic changes in magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "on the basis of neutron diffraction @xcite and macroscopic measurements @xcite , various contradicting magnetic structures , different spin states of co@xmath12 ions as well as spin state ordering ( sso ) have been proposed .",
    "muon - spin relaxation ( @xmath14sr ) studies reveal that irrespective of the rare earth ion , a homogeneous fm phase with ferrimagnetic sso of intermediate spin ( is)and high spin ( hs ) states develops through two first order phase transitions into phase separated afm1 and afm2 phases with different types of antiferromagnetic sso @xcite .",
    "density functional calculations @xcite and resonant photoemission studies @xcite suggest that there is a strong hybridization between o-@xmath15 and co-@xmath16 orbitals with a narrow charge transfer gap near fermi level . with increasing temperature , the pd@xmath17 hybridized hole in the o-@xmath15 valence band suffers a gradual delocalization leading to successive magnetic transitions and spin reorientations .    in this work",
    "we focus our attention on the role of oxygen content on magnetic properties of these double perovskites .",
    "oxygen content not only affects the valence of co ions but also the local coordination around it .",
    "such studies are limited to compounds with smaller rare - earth ions like sm , eu and gd based cobalt double perovskites @xcite .",
    "here the ground state is an antiferromagnetic insulating phase for @xmath18 .",
    "nanoscopic phase separation exists for lower values of @xmath4 while ferrimagnetic order is prevalent for higer values of @xmath4",
    ". a larger rare - earth ion like pr , will affect the strength of the crystal field experienced by co ions and therefore influence the magnetic properties .",
    "an understanding of magnetic properties is important from the point of view of both basic physics and probable applications .",
    "therefore we report here a detailed study of magnetic properties of prbaco@xmath0o@xmath1 , ( 0.35 @xmath2 0.80 ) prepared under very similar synthesis conditions .",
    "the polycrystalline samples of prbaco@xmath0o@xmath1 were prepared by sol - gel method .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of pr@xmath8o@xmath19 , baco@xmath20 and co@xmath0(no@xmath0).6h@xmath0o were dissolved in nitric acid .",
    "citric acid was added to the above solution as a complexing agent . the solution was then heated at 353k to form a gel which was subsequently dried at 433k to remove the solvent .",
    "this precursor was ground , pelletized and heated at 1073 k for 4 hours followed by annealing at 1323 k for 24 hours and slow cooling at the rate of 1@xmath21/min to room temperature to get the required sample .",
    "this as synthesized sample had an oxygen stoichiometry of @xmath22 = 0.80 as determined by iodometric titration analysis .",
    "for iodometric titration , 15 mg of sample and solid ki were dissolved in 1n hcl , and quickly titrated against 0.01n sodium thiosulphate using starch as an indicator .",
    "inert atmosphere was maintained by adding sodium carbonate during titration .",
    "the oxygen content was calculated from the amount of sodium thiosulpahte consumed to get end point .",
    "atleast three to five titrations were perfomed on each sample and the maximum probable error in the oxygen content was found to be less than @xmath23 0.01 .",
    "oxygen content of each compound in the series was varied by individually annealing the samples in argon atmosphere at different temperatures .",
    "in particular , the samples with @xmath4 = 0.67 , 0.58 , 0.5 and 0.43 were annealed respectively at 673k , 873k , 1073k and 1173k for 36 hours while the sample with @xmath4 = 0.35 was annealed twice at 1073k for 36 hours .",
    "iodometric titration was again used to determine the oxygen content of these samples .",
    "the samples were deemed to be phase pure , as x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) data recorded using rigaku d - max iic x - ray diffractometer in the range of @xmath24 using cu k@xmath25 radiation showed no impurity reflections .",
    "the diffraction patterns were rietveld refined using fullprof suite and structural parameters were obtained .",
    "magnetization measurements were carried out as a function of temperature and magnetic field using a quantum design squid magnetometer and vsm at different applied field values of 100 , 1000 and 10000 oe , in the temperature range of 10 k to 300 k. the sample was initially cooled from room temperature to the lowest temperature ( 10k ) in zero applied field .",
    "magnetization was recorded while warming under an applied field ( zero - field cooled ( zfc ) ) and subsequent cooling field - cooled cooling ( fcc ) and warming ( fcw ) cycles .",
    "the isothermal magnetization m(h ) curves were recorded at various temperatures in the field range of @xmath23 7 tesla and @xmath23 14 tesla .",
    "the structure of co based double perovskites is known to depend on the oxygen content @xmath26 . in general",
    "there are three structural regimes reported @xcite .",
    "the hole doped region ( @xmath27 ) wherein the structure is tetragonal , the intermediate region ( @xmath28 ) which is characterized by doubling of @xmath29 axis due to ordering of the co ions and orthorhombic structure and the electron doped region ( @xmath30 ) with the compounds having tetragonal structure .",
    "the limits of structural transition are not strict and often depend on the rare - earth ion . with the change in oxygen content",
    ", the coordination geometry around co ions also changes from octahedral ( @xmath31 ) to square pyramidal(@xmath32 ) .",
    "[ xrd ] displays xrd pattern of as prepared prbaco@xmath33o@xmath34 sample and ar annealed sample prbaco@xmath33o@xmath35 .",
    "rietveld refinement of xrd pattern of prbaco@xmath33o@xmath34 confirms the formation of a largely single phase sample with 112 type tetragonal unit cell belonging to @xmath36 space group .",
    "a very minor impurity phase is detected with peaks around 2@xmath37 @xmath38 29@xmath21 and 31@xmath21 which can be ascribed to unreacted pr - oxides ( pr@xmath33o@xmath39 , pr@xmath10o@xmath19 ) .",
    "these impurity peaks are seen only in the two end members and are not present in any of the intermediate compositions . the tetragonal structure preserves up to @xmath4 = 0.67 .",
    "samples with oxygen content @xmath40 5.58 crystallize in orthorhombic structure with @xmath41 space group and 122 type unit cell .",

    "the zfc and fc magnetization curves of all samples except @xmath4 = 0.80 show pm to fm transition followed by a decrease in magnetization which , based on neutron diffraction results @xcite , is ascribed to a fm to afm transition .",

    "hence the difference between zfc and fc magnetization curves for @xmath54 = 0.8 sample can be ascribed to the presence of competing magnetic interactions .",

    "the transition temperature decreases again to about 50 k for @xmath4 = 0.35 .",
    "muon spin relaxation ( @xmath14sr ) studies on ndbaco@xmath0o@xmath5 attribute the transition around 50 k to a magnetic phase transition @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the magnetization behaviour of compounds with @xmath4 = 0.43 and 0.35 is even more complex .",
    "for example , in case of @xmath57 a double hump structure is observed just below the pm to fm transition .",
    "additionally a upturn in magnetization is observed at t@xmath58 17 k. this can be clearly seen in the inset ( ii ) of fig .",

    "second aspect that stands out is the low values of magnetization in compounds with @xmath60 .",
    "different hypotheses have been considered to explain the low value of the magnetic moment .",
    "firstly , it could be due to presence of low spin ( s = 0 ) co@xmath12 ions as majority species . however , optical studies on eu based double perovskites discounts this possibility @xcite .",
    "the resulting small total magnetization observed at low temperature could be due to ferrimagnetic ordering or mutually orientated moments of co@xmath61 ions in the nonequivalent pyramidal and octahedral sites .",
    "a third hypothesis is based on the coexistence of ferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic phase or on segregation of a fm phase in the antiferromagnetic matrix in the form of ferromagnetic domains .",
    "this phase separation scenario is also observed for gdbaco@xmath33o@xmath1 @xcite . in this case",

    "distortion of polyhedra reflects in increased orthorhombic distortion with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "increased distortions will also result in a decrease in co - o - co inter polyhedral bond angle and thereby favour antiferromagnetic ordering due to localization of charge carriers .",
