    "the macho project has thus far detected 15 candidate microlensing events in the direction of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ( @xcite ) and 2 in the direction of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the lmc events ( @xcite ) and one of the smc events ( @xcite ) appear to have been caused by binary macho lenses .",
    "the lmc observations suggest that perhaps half of the halo consists of machos of average mass @xmath2 .",
    "observational constraints make it unlikely that these machos are main sequence red dwarfs ( @xcite ; @xcite;@xcite ) , or white dwarfs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . given these difficulties , more speculative forms of machos",
    "have been seriously considered , such as primordial black holes or boson stars .",
    "recently , nakamura , sasaki , tanaka , and thorne ( hereafter , nstt ) considered the possibility that the halo machos consist of primordial black holes ( bhmachos)(@xcite ) .",
    "they derived an estimate of the initial binary distribution function , and determined the rate at which bhmachos in binaries would coalesce due to emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "they found extragalactic halo bhmacho coalescences to be promising hypothetical sources of gravitational waves ( gw ) for ground based interferometer detectors such as ligo .    in this letter bhmachos",
    "are again examined as possible sources of gravitational radiation , but now in the low frequency ( @xmath3 ) band where space - based interferometers , such as the proposed lisa ( @xcite ) and omega ( @xcite ) instruments will be most sensitive",
    ". the nstt binary distribution function is assumed , and evolved forward from the time of black hole formation to the present , to determine the distribution of bhmacho binaries in semimajor axis and eccentricity today .",
    "the black hole binaries with orbital frequencies higher than about @xmath4 hz are in highly eccentric orbits , which greatly increases their efficiency as sources of gravitational radiation , and spreads that radiation over a large number of harmonics of the orbital frequency ( @xcite ) .",
    "binary bhmachos are shown to create a strong stochastic background in the low frequency gw band , possibly dominating over all other galactic background sources .",
    "the distribution of black hole macho binaries obtained by nstt defines the probability distribution of values for the semimajor axis @xmath5 and eccentricity @xmath6 of the binary s orbit . utilizing a simple model of primordial black hole formation",
    ", they found the probability distribution to be @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and , as usual , @xmath9 is the cosmological density parameter and @xmath10 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath11 .",
    "allowable values for the semimajor axis are bounded above by @xmath12 , and the eccentricity for each value of @xmath5 is also bounded above , by @xmath13^{1/2}$ ] .    the spatial distribution of black hole macho binaries",
    "is assumed to follow the standard spherical flat rotation halo model @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the local density of dark matter , @xmath16 is the galactocentric radius , @xmath17 is the galactocentric radius of the sun , and @xmath18 is the halo core radius .",
    "the distribution of eq.([halo ] ) is valid from @xmath19 out to some halo radius , @xmath20 ; typical values are @xmath21 , for a halo extending to the lmc ; or @xmath22 for a halo extending half way to m31 .    the nstt distribution given by eq.([fae ] ) is very strongly peaked towards binaries with large eccentricities , due to the @xmath23 factor in @xmath24 .",
    "for example , for binaries with initial orbital frequencies of @xmath25 hz ( which will evolve into the low frequency band today ) 90% of the binaries are within @xmath26 of the maximum eccentricity , @xmath27 . in view of this",
    ", a simplifying assumption will be made : that all black hole macho binaries initially have the @xmath28 .",
    "the distribution of eq.([fae ] ) may then be rewritten in simplified form , after an integration over @xmath6 , as : @xmath29 { da \\over a } \\label{fai}\\ ] ]    the approximated nstt distribution ( with all binaries at their maximum value of @xmath6 ) describes the binary black hole macho population at the time of its formation , in the early universe . in order to calculate the spectrum of gravitational radiation produced by the binary black holes , it is necessary to know the distribution of binaries today .",
    "the population will have evolved due to a variety of effects , such as accretion , gravitational interactions with other machos and with ordinary matter , and due to the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "only this last effect will be considered here .    in order to determine the probability distribution of black hole macho binary orbital parameters today , the initial distribution given in eq.([fai ] ) must be evolved forward in time from the early universe to the present epoch .",
    "the evolution of a binary system of point masses due to gravitational radiation reaction in the weak field limit is well understood ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution was evolved by numerically integration using a fourth - order adaptive stepsize runge - kutta routine .",
    "the results obtained are characterized by two functions : @xmath30 , the present semimajor axis as a function of the initial semimajor axis ( a subscript @xmath31 indicates the present day value of a quantity ) ; and @xmath32 , the present eccentricity as a function of the initial semimajor axis .",
    "the form of the distribution today is illustrated in figure ( 1 ) , in which the present eccentricity , @xmath33 , is plotted against the present orbital frequency , @xmath34 .",
    "the circularizing effect of gravitational radiation reaction is clearly visible ; those binaries with orbital frequencies today of @xmath35 hz or below are still highly eccentric , while those which have evolved to higher frequencies such as @xmath36 hz are basically circular today .",
    "integration of a @xmath37 halo with @xmath38 gives @xmath39 binaries in the low frequency band today , comparable to the expected number of close white dwarf binaries in the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , a @xmath40 halo with @xmath41 will have @xmath42 black hole binaries in the low frequency band today .",
    "the calculation of the gravitational radiation spectrum emitted by the halo population of bhmacho binaries differs substantially from the more familiar calculations for galactic white dwarf binaries .",
    "this is because the bhmacho binaries will generally have non - negligible eccentricity .",
    "a binary system with an eccentric orbit will emit significantly more power in gw than a circular system with the same semimajor axis .",
    "eccentric binaries will also emit gw on a multitude of harmonics of the orbital frequency , whereas circular binaries emit purely in the @xmath43 mode .",
    "peters and mathews ( @xcite ) found that the orbit - averaged power emitted in gravitational radiation by a binary system in the _",
    "n_th harmonic of the orbital frequency is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the orbital frequency associated with semimajor axis @xmath5 ( not the frequency of the harmonic radiation ) , and @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left .",

    "the characteristic spectral amplitude at frequency @xmath45 may be written as a sum over the uncorrelated contributions from the binaries for which @xmath45 is a harmonic , @xmath48^{1/2 } \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{specamp}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the inverse distance squared to the source , averaged over the source distribution , and the frequency @xmath50 is the orbital frequency of a binary system for which the _ j_th harmonic is at frequency : @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , @xmath52 is the eccentricity of the nstt evolved binary for which the _ j_th harmonic is at frequency @xmath45 .",
    "the upper limit on the summation , @xmath53 , is the value of @xmath54 for which the semimajor axis of the binary is at the maximum value @xmath55 . for each value of @xmath54",
    ", @xmath56 gives the number of sources per unit frequency interval at frequency @xmath50 , and @xmath57 is the the power emitted at frequency @xmath45 by a binary with orbital frequency @xmath50 .",
    "the average squared inverse distance between halo sources and the sun may be found by integrating over the source distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ halo ] ) . for a @xmath58 halo , this gives @xmath59 , while for a @xmath60 halo @xmath61 .",
    "the procedure followed to determine the low frequency gw spectrum of the nstt distribution of black hole macho binaries is as follows .",
    "first , a frequency @xmath45 is chosen .",
    "this fixes the frequencies ( and hence semimajor axes ) of the binaries whose _",
    "j_th harmonic will contribute to the sum in eq.([specamp ] ) .",
    "for each harmonic index @xmath54 in eq.([specamp ] ) , the luminosity @xmath57 and the number of binaries per unit frequency interval , @xmath56 , must then be determined .    in order to determine the luminosity from eq.([lne ] ) , the harmonic index @xmath54 must be known , along with the semimajor axis , @xmath5 , and the eccentricity @xmath6 . the semimajor axis is trivially obtained from the orbital frequency @xmath50 , while the eccentricity is also a function of @xmath50 , determined by the numerical evolution of the approximate nstt , as illustrated in fig.([eccevol ] ) . once the eccentricity is known , the function @xmath62 may be evaluated .",
    "direct numerical computation of bessel function values was used for the lowest ten harmonics ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "accurate evaluation of the bessel functions becomes more difficult for larger values of @xmath54 .",
    "an asymptotic expansion was used to fix the value of @xmath64 ( which depends only on @xmath65 ) and the shape of @xmath46 for arbitrary @xmath6 was then modeled analytically using a combination of exponential and trigonometric functions .",
    "trial variation of parameters and functional forms within the analytic fit indicate that the resulting luminosity is robustly estimated to about one percent accuracy .",
    "the evaluation of the number of binaries present today per unit frequency interval , @xmath66 , for an arbitrary binary frequency @xmath45 , may be split into three pieces : @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the initial fraction of all black hole macho binaries per unit semimajor axis interval , @xmath69 is the amount by which an infinitesimal interval in semimajor axis has expanded or contracted in evolving to the present day , and @xmath70 is the final conversion from semimajor axis to present orbital frequency via kepler s third law . given an orbital frequency @xmath34 today , the initial value of the semimajor axis @xmath71 may be determined from the results of the numerical evolution of the approximate nstt distribution .",
    "then , @xmath68 may be directly evaluated from eq.([fai ] ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath69 is also determined from the numerically evolved nstt distribution .",
    "multiplication of the factors in eq.([dndf ] ) gives the number of binaries per unit frequency interval as a function of frequency , today .",
    "the results confirm the notion that the total gw signal from the black hole macho binaries will be stochastic in nature .",
    "assuming an integration time of 4 months ( typical of lisa or omega ) , every @xmath72 bin will include modes from multiple binaries for all frequencies @xmath73 . above that frequency , individual bins may be occupied by individual binaries evolving towards coalescence , or may be empty , opening windows in which weaker sources ( e.g. , extragalactic ) could be observed .",
    "the total gravitational wave spectral amplitude was then evaluated for a set of frequencies , @xmath45 , incorporating contributions from harmonics up to a maximum value @xmath53 .",
    "setting @xmath53 equal to @xmath74 was found to provide an accuracy over the entire frequency range @xmath75 of better than one percent ; specifically , the inclusion of @xmath76 harmonics rather than @xmath77 changes the spectral amplitude by less than 1% over this range .    the resulting spectrum of gravitational radiation is shown in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "both curves illustrated represent small halos , @xmath21 , with @xmath38 for the lower curve and @xmath41 for the upper curve .",
    "the spectrum is only weakly dependent of the value of the halo radius ; a larger halo simply adds additional sources at large distance .",
    "curves for a @xmath60 halo are of the same shape as those illustrated , but with spectral amplitude increased by a constant factor of @xmath78 over the full frequency range ( on the logarithmic plot of fig([fig2 ] ) , this corresponds to moving the curves upwards by @xmath79 ) .",
    "the peak in the spectrum at around @xmath80 is due to a combination of circumstances .",
    "binaries whose @xmath43 mode is at that frequency have eccentricities of around @xmath81 ( see fig.([eccevol ] ) ) , so that still about 50% of their power is being emitted in the @xmath43 mode(@xcite ) . at the same time , lower frequency binaries within an order of magnitude in frequency are significantly eccentric , so that they contribute substantial power at @xmath82 through their higher harmonics . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the lower frequency binaries are more nearly circular , and their higher harmonics do not contribute so much power . at lower frequencies , the fundamental mode s contribution ( and ,",
    "later , the higher modes contributions ) drops off sharply due to the @xmath83 dependence in eq.([lne ] ) .    at high frequencies ,",
    "the spectrum is seen to approach a power law behavior , @xmath84 . since binaries in the higher frequency range",
    "are nearly circular , essentially all of the signal is generated by the @xmath43 harmonic .",
    "the observed power law is then explained by noting that @xmath85 , while the factors of @xmath66 in eq.([dndf ] ) have the following asymptotic form : @xmath86 . using these asymptotic forms in eq .",
    "( [ specamp ] ) and only including the @xmath87 mode yields @xmath88 .    also shown in fig.([fig2 ] ) are the sensitivity curves for the proposed lisa ( @xcite ) and omega ( @xcite ) space interferometer gw detectors , and a recent estimate of the background due to galactic close white dwarf binaries ( cwdb ) ( @xcite ) . except at low frequencies",
    ", the bhmacho binary background would be notably stronger than the cwdb background .",
    "the halo black hole binaries would form a strong `` confusion noise '' stochastic background , significantly larger than the instrument noise in either proposed interferometer over a large frequency range @xmath89 .",
    "of course , while the stochastic signal is in one sense a noise , it also provides direct information on the nature and distribution of macho binaries in the galactic halo .",
    "whether the halo machos are primordial black holes , white dwarfs , boson stars , or some other type of compact object , some fraction of them will be in binary systems . given the huge number of machos in the galaxy s halo , the low frequency gravitational wave signal from these binary systems will quite likely be detectable by the space - based interferometers .",
    "these interferometers will be excellent instruments for determining the nature and population of the halo macho binaries .",
