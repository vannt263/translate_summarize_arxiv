    "the current - phase relation characterizes the flow of a superfluid / superconductor through a weak link @xcite .",

    "much information about such systems can be extracted from the current - phase relation , which , given a fluid , depends only on the link properties .",
    "for instance , with @xmath3he , the transition from the usual ac josephson effect to a quantized phase slippage regime @xcite corresponds to the switching from a sine - like current phase relation to a multivalued one @xcite .",
    "a weak link configuration can be modelled very generally upon taking a portion of a superfluid / superconductor to have `` different conduction properties '' with respect to the rest of the system .",

    "theoretically , the current - phase relation has been studied for a flow through a repulsive square well with fermions across the bcs - bec crossover by means of one dimensional bogoliubov - de gennes equations @xcite , for weak barriers with bosons in a local density approximation @xcite , and for fermions on the bec side of the crossover using a nonlinear schrdinger equation approach @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we study the current - phase relation for a bec flowing through a repulsive square well",
    ". the weak link configuration , and in turn the current - phase relation , is then determined by the barrier height with respect to the chemical potential and by the barrier width with respect to the healing length .",
    "though we solve a one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation , the results presented in this manuscript are not just relevant for becs , but also include the essential features of current - phase relations of superconducting or superfluid he - based weak links when governed by the ginzburg - landau equation . for any barrier width",
    ", we find that in the limit of zero barrier height , the current phase relation tends to @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the bulk sound velocity , which corresponds to the phase across a grey soliton at rest with respect to the barrier . on the other hand ,",
    "if the barrier height is above the bulk chemical potential at zero current , the limit of tunneling flow is reached either when the barrier height is much bigger than the bulk chemical potential at zero current or when the barrier width is much larger than the bulk healing length . in this regime , we recover the the usual josephson sinusoidal current - phase relation and obtain an analytical expression for the josephson critical current as a function of the weak link parameters . for barriers wider than the healing lenght inside the barrier region",
    ", we observe two families of multivalued ( often called reentrant ) current - phase relations .",
    "the first , already studied since the early works on superconductivity @xcite , shows a positive slope of the current when the phase difference is close to @xmath6 , thereby reaching a phase difference larger than @xmath6 at least for small currents .",
    "the second family , appearing at a smaller barrier height , has instead a negative slope of the current close to @xmath6 , and in some cases can remain within the @xmath7 interval across the whole range of currents .",
    "these two families can also be distinguished by the maximum number of different positive currents corresponding to the same phase difference : two for the first family , three for the second one . as the first kind of reentrant behavior",
