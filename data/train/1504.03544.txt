    "various cosmological observations , coming from the type ia supernovae ( sneia ) surveys @xcite , the large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy spectrum @xcite and the hubble parameter @xmath3 @xcite , have indicated that the universe is in a phase of accelerated expansion . regarding the accelerated expansion of the universe , there are two main categories of probable solutions .",
    "one is to assume that in the context of general relativity ( gr ) , the universe is dominated by a new cosmic fluid with negative pressure .",
    "this kind of exotic matter which violates the strong energy condition is so called  dark energy  ( de ) @xcite .",
    "another alternative , originates from the modification of gravity @xcite .",
    "in modified gravity ( mg ) theories , there is no require for de with exclusive properties , but instead , the action contains a general function of invariants obtained from the riemann curvature tensor such as the ricci scalar , @xmath4 , @xcite or the gauss - bonnet invariant term , @xmath5 , @xcite or the torsion scalar , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite it was shown that mg may serve as dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "one of interesting alternative theories of gravity is modified gauss - bonnet gravity , so - called @xmath0-gravity , where @xmath0 is a general function of the gauss - bonnet curvature invariant term @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-gravity can justify the present accelerated expansion of the universe without resorting to de . besides",
    ", it can also describe the phantom divide line crossing as well as the cosmic transition from deceleration to acceleration phase @xcite .",
    "the cosmologically viable @xmath0 models need to be close to the @xmath1cdm model in the deep matter era , but the deviation from it becomes important at late times on cosmological scales .",
    "an appreciable deviation from the @xmath1cdm cosmology yields the modification of the matter power spectrum , which can be used as a crucial tool to distinguish @xmath0-gravity from the @xmath1cdm model .    additionally , the thermodynamical interpretation of gravity is one of another interesting topics in modern cosmology . from the viewpoint of the physics of the black holes ,",
    "there is a deep rooted connection between thermodynamics and gravity @xcite .",
    "this connection was first discovered in the einstein gravity for the rindler spacetime @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that by assuming the geometric entropy given by a quarter of the apparent horizon area of a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , the friedmann equation in the einstein gravity can be written in the form of the first law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the connection between thermodynamics and gravity has also been investigated in @xmath8-gravity and scalar - tensor theory @xcite , @xmath9-gravity @xcite , lovelock theory @xcite and braneworld scenarios ( such as dgp , rsi and rsii ) @xcite .",
    "it is also of great interest to generalize our discussion to study the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics .",
    "the gsl states that the entropy of matter inside the horizon of the universe plus the geometric entropy of the horizon is non - decreasing with time @xcite . note that the ordinary second law of thermodynamics only deals with the entropy of matter inside the universe . in the einstein gravity",
    ", it was shown that the gsl in the presence of de is always satisfied @xcite .",
    "the validity of the gsl was also examined in different theories of mg @xcite-@xcite .",
    "here our main aim is to explore the gsl and the thermodynamics of the apparent horizon in @xmath0-gravity , and obtain the condition for the gsl to be satisfied .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the @xmath0-gravity . in section 3 , we investigate the gsl of thermodynamics on the dynamical apparent horizon with the hawking temperature . in section 4 , we study the dynamics of @xmath0-gravity . in section 5 ,",
    "we give numerical results obtained for the evolution of some cosmological parameters , check the energy conditions and examine the validity of the gsl for two viable @xmath0 models .",
    "section 6 is devoted to conclusions .",
