    "evolutionary game theory ( egt ) originated from the work of john maynard smith and george r. price who applied the theory of strategic games developed by john von neumann and oskar morgenstern to evolution problems in biology . unlike game theory , egt investigates the dynamical processes of biological populations .",
    "independently a. lotkla and v. volterra introduced the following class of o.d.e.s @xmath0 currently known as lotka - volterra ( lv ) systems , and usually taken as models for the time evolution of ecosystems in @xmath1 species .",
    "although historically this class of systems preceded egt they are now considered an integral part of this theory .",
    "the entries @xmath2 represent interactions between different species , while the coefficients @xmath3 stand for the specie s natural growth rates . in his studies",
    "@xcite v. volterra gave special attention to predator - prey systems and their generalization to food chain systems in @xmath1 species , which fall in the category of dissipative and conservative lv systems .",
    "denoting by @xmath4_{{ij } } } $ ] its interaction matrix , a lv system is said to be _ dissipative _ , resp .",
    "_ conservative _ , if there exists a positive diagonal matrix @xmath5 such that @xmath6 , resp .",
    "@xmath7 is skew symmetric .",
    "the matrix @xmath5 was interpreted by volterra as some sort of normalization by the average weights of the different species .",
    "if the lv system admits an equilibrium point @xmath8 the following function @xmath9 @xmath10 is either a decreasing lyapunov function , if the system is dissipative , or else a constant of motion , if the system is conservative .",
    "volterra proved that the dynamics of any @xmath1 species conservative lv system can be embedded in a hamiltonian system of dimension @xmath11 .",
    "more recently , in the 1980 s , redheffer et al . developed further the teory of dissipative lv systems , introducing and studying the class of stably dissipative systems  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite a re - interpretation was given for the hamiltonian character of the dynamics of any conservative lv system : there is a poisson structure on @xmath12 which makes the system hamiltonian .",
    "another interesting fact from  @xcite , which stresses the importance of studying hamiltonian lv systems , is that the limit dynamics of any stably dissipative lv system is described by a conservative lv system .",
    "another class of o.d.e.s , which plays a central role in egt , is the _ replicator equation _",
    "defined on the simplex @xmath13 by @xmath14 the coefficients of this o.d.e .",
    "are stored in an @xmath15 real matrix @xmath4_{{ij } } } $ ] , that is referred as the _ pay - off _ matrix . a game theoretical interpretation for this equation",
    "is provided in section  [ section : polymatrix ] .",
    "check  @xcite on the history of this equation . in  @xcite j. hofbauer introduced a change of coordinates , mapping @xmath16 to the simplex @xmath17 minus one face , which conjugates any lv system in @xmath12 to a time re - parametrization of a replicator system in @xmath17 , and vice - versa .",
    "thus when a lv system is conservative then the corresponding replicator system is orbit equivalent to a hamiltonian system .",
    "on the other hand , any replicator system on @xmath18 with skew symmetric pay - off matrix extends to a lv system on @xmath12 with @xmath19 , and hence can be viewed as a restriction of a hamiltonian lv system on @xmath12 .",
    "up to our knowledge these are the known subclasses of hamiltonian replicator systems .",
    "asymmetric or bimatrix games lead to another fundamental class of models in egt , the following system of o.d.e.s whose coefficients are displayed in two pay - off matrices , @xmath20 of order @xmath21 and @xmath22 of order @xmath23 . @xmath24",
    "the phase space of this equation is the prism @xmath25 .",
    "a game theoretical interpretation is given in section  [ section : polymatrix ] .",
    "it was remarked by i. eshel and e. akin  @xcite that up to a time re - parametrization these systems always preserve volume . for @xmath26-zero - sum games ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath26-partnership games ( @xmath28 ) , with an interior equilibrium point in the prism @xmath25 , j. hofbauer proved in  @xcite that this bimatrix system is orbit equivalent to a hamiltonian system w.r.t . some poisson structure in the interior of the prism .",
    "previously , e. akin and v. losert  @xcite had noticed the hamiltonian character of this model in the zero - sum case .",
    "polymatrix games , like @xmath1-player games , generalize the concept of bimatrix games .",
    "the main difference between them is that interactions between players are bilateral in the former game but not in the latter .",
    "the first reference we could find on the existence of equilibria for these games is the paper of j. howson  @xcite who attributes the concept of polymatrix game to e. yanovskaya ( 1968 ) .",
    "more recently , the structure of nash equilibria for polymatrix games is studied by l. quintas in  @xcite .",
    "we introduce a class of o.d.es , referred as _",
    "polymatrix replicator equation _",
    ", that generalizes to polymatrix games the symmetric and asymmetric replicator equations .",
    "we are not aware of any reference on this equation in the literature .",
    "the phase space of these systems are finite products of simplexes .",
    "we introduce the concept of _ conservative _ polymatrix game , which in the case of bimatrix games extends the @xmath26-zero - sum games ( @xmath27 ) and the @xmath26-partnership games ( @xmath28 ) . in theorem",
    "[ prop : main ] we introduce a class of poisson structures on finite products of simplexes ( see  ) .",
    "we will show that these prisms are stratified poisson spaces ( see section  [ poissonreduction ] ) .",
    "then in theorem  [ conservative : hamiltonian ] we show that any conservative polymatrix game determines a hamiltonian polymatrix replicator .",
    "this work extends and unifies several known facts on hamiltonian replicator o.d.e.s . in the end of section [ section : polymatrix ]",
    "we compare our results with known facts mentioned in the state of the art subsection .",

    "we state and prove the main results . in section 4",
