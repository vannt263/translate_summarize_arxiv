    "after many years of intensive research in the `` quantum chaos area '' it is now commonly accepted that the quantum behavior of complex systems may be strongly correlated with the character of their classical motion @xcite . even such a purely quantum phenomenon as tunneling",
    "may be profoundly affected by chaotic classical dynamics . for regular systems a smooth dependence of the tunneling rate on parameters",
    "is expected . in the presence of chaotic motion ,",
    "the tunneling rates typically strongly fluctuate , the game is then to identify both the average behavior and the statistical properties of the fluctuations .",
    "imagine the situation when the wavefunction is predominantly localized in a region of regular motion .",
    "the tunneling to the chaotic sea surrounding the regular island , called `` chaos assisted tunneling '' ( cat ) has been quite thoroughly studied @xcite .",
    "it may be characterized by the statistics of tunneling rates , or directly measurable quantities such as tunneling splittings between doublets of different symmetries @xcite or tunneling widths @xcite where the tunneling to the chaotic sea leads eventually to decay ( e.g. to ionization of atomic species ) .",
    "model based on random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite show that distributions of both quantities are closely correlated with both the splittings @xcite and _ square roots _ of the widths @xcite having a common cauchy ( lorentzian - like ) distribution with an exponential cutoff for extremely large events .",
    "such a situation occurs for sufficiently small @xmath0 ( in the semiclassical regime ) when the tunneling coupling is much smaller than the mean level spacing in a given system .",
    "another possibility occurs when virtually all accessible phase space ( at a given energy ) is chaotic : the tunneling occurs through a potential ( rather than dynamical as in the previous case ) barrier",
    ". then a standard rmt based answer leads to the porter - thomas distribution of widths ( or its appropriate many channel extension ) as applied in various areas from nuclear physics @xcite , mesoscopics @xcite or chemical reactions @xcite to name a few .",
    "creagh and whelan @xcite developed a semiclassical approach to tunneling ( for a semiclassical treatment concentrating on other aspects of tunneling see e.g. @xcite ) which enabled them to give an improved statistical distribution of tunneling rates  @xcite .",
    "the distribution has been tested on a model system and shown to faithfully represent the tunneling splitting distribution provided the classical dynamics is sufficiently chaotic . however",
    ", this distribution fails for systems when scarred @xcite wavefunctions dominate the process . in order to take into account scarring ,",
    "the same authors  @xcite developed a more complicated semiclassical theory which , in a model system , accurately describes the numerically observed tunneling rates .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , we propose a simpler approach to the effect of scarring than that in  @xcite .",
    "our approach is less general , as it is limited to the case when only one channel contributes to tunneling .",
    "this is , however , a very frequent situation : because tunneling typically decays exponentially with some parameter , most contributions are often hidden by a single dominant one . the formulas that we obtain are also much simpler .",
    "secondly , we consider the tunneling rate distribution in a challenging , realistic system - a hydrogen atom in parallel electric and magnetic fields .",
    "as mentioned by creagh and whelan , one expects there the above mentioned problems due to scar - dominated tunneling . here",
    "again we test the proposed distribution on a vast set of numerical data .",
    "thirdly , in contrast with most of the previous studies , we do not consider here a situation where tunneling manifests itself as a quasi - degeneracy between a pair of even - odd states , but rather the case when tunneling is followed by a subsequent ionization of the system and manifests itself in the widths ( ionization rates ) of resonances .",
    "the analysis for both cases is similar , but not identical .",
    "let us recall first shortly the analysis of chaotic tunneling used in  @xcite , which makes it possible to predict the distribution of tunneling rates in terms of classical quantities .",
    "this approach is based on the standard semiclassical expansion of the green function as a sum over classical orbits ( which is used e.g. in periodic orbit theory _  la gutzwiller _ ) , but incorporates in addition some complex orbits , that is orbits where time , position and momentum can be made complex .",
    "such orbits may tunnel through the potential well and eventually lead to escape at infinity ; they are essential for the calculation of tunneling rates . in the one - dimensional case",
    ", it is well understood that tunneling can be quantitatively described using a single complex orbit known as the instanton : the orbit propagates under the potential well with a purely real position , and purely imaginary time and momentum , until it emerges in the real phase space when the potential barrier is crossed ( it can be visualized as a standard real orbit in the inverted potential ) .",
    "the action @xmath1 of the instanton is then purely imaginary @xmath2 and the tunneling rate is , not surprisingly , essentially described by the @xmath3 contribution .    for a multidimensional system ,",
    "the situation is somehow comparable , except that there are now several instanton orbits .",
    "it also turns out that the structure of the tunneling complex orbits can be extremely complicated  @xcite .",
    "however , because of the exponential decrease of the tunneling rate , in the semiclassical limit @xmath4 there are cases when the instanton orbit with the smallest imaginary action will give the dominant contribution .",
    "creagh and whelan succeeded in expressing the tunneling rate in terms of the action and stability exponent of the instanton orbit  @xcite .",
    "they were able to describe the situation of a symmetric double well , where tunneling manifests itself through the existence of pairs of quasi - degenerate states , i.e. to calculate the splitting of the doublets .",
    "comparison with  exact \" numerical results for a model system showed a very good agreement  @xcite .",
    "they were also able to describe the situation of tunneling outside a single potential well ( with chaotic dynamics inside the well ) followed by  ionization \" , that is particle directly escaping toward infinity .",
    "the quantity of interest is the  weighted \" density of states , where the weight is given by the widths @xmath5 of the resonances with energies @xmath6 : @xmath7 in the semiclassical approximation , it can be written  in the spirit of periodic orbit theory  as the sum of smooth and oscillatory terms : @xmath8 explicitly , the smooth term reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ( imaginary ) action of the periodic instanton ( that is the full orbit back and forth across the potential well ) , @xmath11 the number of freedoms of the system and @xmath12 the @xmath13 stability matrix of the instanton .",
    "the oscillatory term is not explicitly written by creah and whelan , but it is rather simple to calculate it from their papers . in the simple case where the classical orbit which is the real continuation of the instanton inside the potential well is a periodic orbit ( this is for example the case when the instanton is along a symmetry axis of the potential ) , it is not surprising that the oscillatory terms will be governed by the properties of this real periodic orbit .",
    "indeed , it is known that the eigenstates inside the well will be scarred by such an orbit , thus showing either an increased or decreased probability density at the point where the instanton emerges .",
    "it is thus reasonable to expect that scarred ( resp .",
    "anti scarred ) states will show an increased ( resp .",
    "decreased ) tunneling probability .",
    "the modulations of the weighted density of states are thus related to the action of the real periodic orbit .",
    "more specifically , one gets : @xmath14}}{\\sqrt{(-1)^{d-1}\\det(wm^j - i ) } } }   \\label{cw4}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the ( real ) action of the periodic orbit in the well and @xmath16 its stability matrix .",
    "the sum over @xmath17 just takes into account the repetitions of this orbit .",
    "this approach is restricted to a low tunneling rate , when repetitions of the instanton give negligible contributions .",
    "the fact that , in the contribution of the instanton , there is a @xmath18 prefactor , half the prefactor for the oscillatory term , is not trivial , but explained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we consider a hydrogen atom placed in static parallel magnetic and electric fields .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is ( for infinite mass of the nucleus , neglecting relativistic and qed corrections , in atomic units )    @xmath19    where @xmath20 stands traditionally for the magnetic field in atomic units ( @xmath21 tesla ) while @xmath22 is the static electric field ( in atomic units of @xmath23 v / m ) assumed to be oriented , together with the magnetic field , along the @xmath24 axis .",
    "the system obeys cylindrical symmetry and @xmath25 is a constant of motion .",
    "the last , zeeman term in the hamiltonian gives thus a constant shift ( for a given @xmath25 ) and will be omitted for simplicity .",
    "classically , the atom may ionize for energies @xmath26 .",
    "note that ionization occurs in the @xmath27 direction - the diamagnetic term provides a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator binding potential in the perpendicular directions .",
    "the character of the classical motion depends on the energy as well as on the relative magnitude of electric and magnetic fields , as discussed long time ago in  @xcite .",
    "in fact the system obeys the standard classical scaling laws @xcite .",
    "explicitly , scaling with respect to the magnetic field as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , leads to a new hamiltonian dependent on two parameters only , the scaled energy @xmath33 and scaled electric field @xmath34 @xmath35 later on we shall drop the @xmath36 sign using classically scaled variables only .    with this scaling and for @xmath37 ( pure magnetic field ) ,",
    "the motion is predominantly regular for small @xmath38 ; for larger @xmath39 a gradual transition to chaos takes place so that , for @xmath40 practically all the available phase space becomes chaotic  @xcite .",
    "this character of the motion is basically preserved for @xmath41 , provided @xmath42 i.e. , below the classical ionization threshold .",
    "quantum mechanics does not preserve the scaling . instead of finding , however , eigenenergies at given values of magnetic @xmath20 and electric @xmath22 fields",
    ", it is a celebrated tradition now to consider scaled spectra @xcite , i.e. choose values of external fields as to obtain eigenenergies at fixed @xmath33 .",
    "this procedure is straightforward .",
    "rewriting the schrdinger equation , one may obtain a generalized eigenvalue problem for fixed @xmath33 ( and @xmath34 in our case ) from which quantized field values @xmath43 are obtained .",
    "if one were to get back to the original problem , then a given @xmath44 value together with the definition of @xmath33 yields the energy @xmath6 which is an eigenvalue of the original schrdinger equation for that @xmath44 field value .",
    "the set of @xmath44 obtained for a fixed values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 corresponds to the very same classical dynamics while different @xmath43 play the role of different values of the effective planck constant @xmath45 .",
    "one may then expect that to study quantum tunneling in the semiclassical regime with a well defined classical mechanics , it is sufficient to diagonalize a standard scaled problem .",
    "this is , however , not completely true : indeed , because tunneling implies that the electron ionizes , the energy spectrum is not a discrete spectrum of bound states , but rather composed of resonances . far below the classical ionization threshold ,",
    "the widths of the resonances are extremely small and can be neglected",
    ". then diagonalization of the hamiltonian in a convenient basis set may produce a discrete energy spectrum which very well approximates the true resonances .",
    "on the other hand , far above the ionization threshold , the spectrum is continuous and basically unstructured .",
    "we are interested in the intermediate situation , in the vicinity of the classical ionization threshold , where the resonances have a small but significant width due to tunneling followed by ionization .",
    "the treatment of tunneling resonances necessitates a further standard extension , known from the pure magnetic field case above the ionization threshold @xcite : a complex rotation approach @xcite .",
    "the idea is to apply the following complex scaling ( or rotation if viewed in the complex plane ) : @xmath46 , @xmath47 to the hamiltonian of the system , where @xmath48 is a real positive parameter representing the complex rotation angle ( typically of the order of 0.1 rad ) .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian is no longer an hermitian operator , and its diagonalization yields complex eigenvalues @xmath49 where @xmath6 is the energy of the resonance and @xmath5 its width , i.e. the inverse of its lifetime .",
    "well below the classical ionization threshold , eq .",
    "( [ classth ] ) , the widths should be vanishingly small ; with increasing @xmath50 some states , notably those extended in @xmath27 direction , i.e. , along the `` ionization direction '' , should have increased imaginary parts indicating tunneling ionization . above the threshold , eq .",
    "( [ classth ] ) , ionization becomes classically allowed and the widths are expected to be large .",
    "moreover , in the tunneling regime , the widths should on the average exponentially decrease in magnitude with decreasing @xmath0 according to an @xmath51 law with @xmath10 being a characteristic tunneling action .",
    "the expectations described in the previous section are based on a rough classical analysis of the ionization process . in order to test these ideas and the semiclassical prediction for the widths of the resonances",
    ", we have performed extensive numerical studies of the energy spectrum of the system .",
    "the matrix representing the complex rotated hamiltonian in a sturmian basis set @xcite is easily obtained , as matrix elements have strong selection rules and are all known as simple analytic expressions .",
    "the matrix in then diagonalized using the lanczos algorithm @xcite , producing several hundreds or thousands fully converged eigenvalues .",
    "we have carefully checked that all eigenvalues presented in this paper are fully converged .",
    "the only limitation is that the calculation is performed in double precision , yielding about 12 significant digits .",
    "this also implies that widths ( tunneling rates ) smaller than @xmath52 can not be accurately computed .",
    "it turns out that , below the classical ionization threshold , eq .  ( [ classth ] ) , the widths of the resonances are usually very small . moreover , as we are interested in the situation when the classical dynamics inside the potential well is chaotic , we have to use a rather large value of the scaled energy @xmath33  typically @xmath53  which in turns correspond to a rather small value of the scaled electric field at the ionization threshold , that is typically @xmath54 from eq .",
    "( [ classth ] ) . for these values",
    ", we observed that the numerically computed widths are all vanishingly small , smaller than the @xmath52 accuracy of the numerics .",
    "this can be understood from eq .",
    "( [ cw3 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the stability exponent of the instanton orbit is in our specific case enormous .",
    "the reason is that the potential in the vicinity of the saddle point is very anisotropic .",
    "it is strongly bounded by the diamagnetic term in the transverse @xmath55 plane but has a only a very smooth potential maximum in the field @xmath56 direction .",
    "the instanton can be seen as a real orbit propagating in the inverted potential .",
    "this inverted potential has a shallow minimum in the @xmath27 direction but falls down very rapidly in the transverse directions : the instanton moves along a sharp potential ridge and is thus extremely unstable .",
    "we show in the appendix how to calculate the action @xmath10 and stability matrix @xmath12 of the instanton . for small @xmath34 ( the regime we are interested in ) ,",
    "the following approximate expressions are sufficient : @xmath57 and @xmath58    for @xmath59 the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ cw3 ] ) is thus of the order of @xmath60 which explains that the widths can not be measured in a numerical experiment .",
    "an alternative , equivalent ,  quantum \" explanation can be given .",
    "the magnetic field term in the hamiltonian is responsible for a harmonic potential in the direction perpendicular to the fields .",
    "thus the quantum mechanical energy of the motion in the @xmath61 plane can not be smaller than the energy of the lowest state of the corresponding oscillator .",
    "for @xmath62 the energy in question is the ground state energy @xmath63 while for other ( conserved ) @xmath64 values it is @xmath65 . reaching the energy of the classical ionization threshold",
    "is thus not sufficient for the quantum system to ionize .",
    "it requires the additional zero - point energy @xmath66 to be able to overcome the potential barrier .",
    "as the harmonic potential is quite strong , this excess energy is rather high and has the effect of tremendously reducing the ionization probability .",
    "for the scaled problem , the energy shift @xmath66 translate into a shift of the scaled energy : @xmath67    the equivalence of the two points of view can be established by noting that the expression  ( [ denum ] ) has itself an exponential dependence , which can be combined with the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ cw3 ] ) .",
    "we obtain : @xmath68}\\ ] ] which can also be written as : @xmath69 } \\label{f0}\\ ] ] where ( here for @xmath70 ) @xmath71 the physical meaning of these equations is rather clear . in effect",
    ", tunneling can be described with a standard exponential[action/@xmath45 ] , provided the amount @xmath73 of energy is subtracted from the total available energy @xmath74 the global effect of the degrees of freedom transverse to the instanton is nothing but a shift of the energy available for tunneling by the zero - point energy in the transverse direction .",
    "such an analysis does not take into account the azimuthal symmetry around the fields axis and the fact that the contributions of the various @xmath64 values can be separated in the numerical calculation .",
    "not surprisingly , tunneling is much more effective for @xmath70 states which are not repelled from the @xmath27 axis by a centrifugal potential and thus feel more efficiently the instanton . in the quantum point of view ,",
    "such states have the lowest transverse zero - point energy @xmath75 for other @xmath64 values , the treatment of creagh and whelan has to be adapted : instead of considering the full semiclassical green function of the system , one must expand it on the various @xmath64 subspaces and use only the relevant component in each subspace .",
    "a similar problem occurs in periodic orbit theory when one is interested in the contribution to the density of states of an orbit along the @xmath27 axis .",
    "how to deal with such a problem has been described in a general manner by bogomolny  @xcite and in a specific case by shaw and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "the rule is that higher powers of the stability matrix come into play , for example @xmath76 instead of @xmath16 for the real orbit .",
    "the situation is similar for the instanton , resulting in the denominator being raised to power @xmath77 the net effect is again taken into account by shifting the scaled energy by @xmath78 i.e. the transverse zero - point energy in the @xmath64 subspace .",
    "thus results in an effective quantum ionization threshold : @xmath79    because of the transverse zero - point energy , in the presence of magnetic field , _ larger _ electric field strengths are necessary to observe the same ionization yield , or , conversely , larger scaled energy is required for a fixed electric field strength .",
    "we have thus performed numerical diagonalization of the scaled hamiltonian _ above _ the classical ionization threshold , eq .",
    "( [ classth ] ) .",
    "the results is shown in fig .",
    "[ scaled ] , where the widths of the resonances are plotted versus the quantized value of @xmath80 the inverse of the effective planck s constant . at low @xmath81 i.e. large @xmath82",
    "the transverse zero - point energy is so large that the quantum ionization threshold , eq .",
    "( [ qth ] ) , is far above the scaled energy of the state which consequently has a vanishingly small ionization rate .",
    "this corresponds to the region @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ scaled](a ) , where the widths are smaller than the numerical accuracy . as @xmath84",
    "is increased , the quantum ionization threshold decreases and significant tunneling takes place , as observed in the range @xmath85 finally , at sufficiently high @xmath84 value , the scaled energy is higher than the quantum ionization threshold and direct ionization takes place .",
    "there , the ionization rates are large , comparable to the spacing between consecutive resonances and the tunneling regime is left . in the figure , the @xmath84 value where the quantum ionization threshold is reached is marked by the dotted line , and agrees with the numerical results .",
    "the two values of @xmath33 for @xmath70 and @xmath86 have to be chosen quite different in order to observe the transition within the range of @xmath84 available from numerical diagonalization .",
    "let us note that also in the pure magnetic field case , the statistics of level spacings in the vicinity of the ionization threshold is sensitive to the very same quantum threshold law @xcite .",
    "the behavior observed in fig .  [",
    "scaled ] has important consequences . to study tunneling",
    ", we should consider only the region just below the threshold ; this region is very small and the tunneling rate changes very rapidly with @xmath20 .",
    "thus , scaled spectroscopy is not appropriate for the analysis of statistical properties of tunneling .",
    "as it is clear from the discussion above and the examples depicted in the figures , the proper parameter characterizing the spectrum is not @xmath33 but rather @xmath87 . in order to overcome the difficulty described in the previous section , a simple solution is thus to scale the problem following the effective quantum ionization threshold instead of the classical one .",
    "one then gets rid of the huge denominator due to the transverse motion and may more easily concentrate on the interesting dynamics , namely the interplay between the instanton and the chaotic dynamics inside the potential well .",
    "we will thus solve the schroedinger equation , not at constant scaled energy @xmath33 , but at constant modified scaled energy @xmath88 , eq .",
    "( [ hat_epsilon ] ) .",
    "this results in the following generalized ( non linear ) eigenvalue problem for the effective planck s constant @xmath89 and the eigenstates @xmath90 @xmath91 with @xmath92 the laplace operator .",
    "this equation is solved by expansion over a sturmian basis and a modified version of the lanczos algorithm adapted to such a generalized eigenvalue problem  @xcite .",
    "we have been able to obtain a few thousands of resonance widths for a given @xmath64 value , all lying in the tunneling regime .",
    "an example is presented in fig .",
    "[ unscaled ] .    as expected from eq .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) , the ionization rate shows an overall exponential decrease with @xmath93 the rate of this decrease is directly related to the tunneling action of the instanton : the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) is shown as a dashed line in the figure .",
    "obviously , the agreement is excellent .",
    "it should be noted that the semiclassical prediction is entirely obtained from classical ingredients and free of any parameter .",
    "note also the existence of very large fluctuations ",
    "characteristic of chaotic tunneling  around the mean value .    in order to make a more quantitative test , we remove the global exponential decrease and define , following  @xcite , a rescaled width :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the density of states .    from its definition ,",
    "the @xmath96 should have average value unity in the semiclassical limit .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath96 ( same data than in fig .",
    "[ unscaled ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ rescaled ] , on a linear scale .",
    "it has very large fluctuations ",
    "several orders of magnitude with a large proportion of very small ionization rates  but we checked that the average value of @xmath96 is constant across the spectrum within a few percent ( although the @xmath5 themselves vary over five orders of magnitude ) and equal to @xmath97 this is only slightly smaller than unity .",
    "the difference might be due to deviations from harmonicity of the potential in the vicinity of the saddle point ( an assumption made in our calculation ) .",
    "another plausible source of deviation is the assumption made in the calculation of creagh and whelan that every electron which tunnels through the barrier will eventually ionize ; although this is very likely to happen , the channel along the @xmath27 axis may also reflect a small part of the electronic wavefunction , even after tunneling took place .",
    "this would manifest itself by the @xmath96 being smaller than unity .",
    "the main point remains that semiclassics is able to predict quantitatively the average behavior of the ionization rates in the tunneling regime .",
    "beyond the average behavior discussed in the previous section , we are also interested in the fluctuations of the ionization rates . the most probable origin of these fluctuations is the fact that the classical dynamics inside the potential well is chaotic .",
    "this implies that the resonance wavefunctions in the well display apparently erratic fluctuations from state to state .",
    "states with a large probability density near the classical saddle point are more likely to tunnel and ionize that the ones with small probability density . as a simple approximation , the tunneling probability and",
    "thus the ionization rate is proportional to the squared overlap between the eigenstate and a wavepacket optimally tuned for tunneling , i.e. built to follow the instanton trajectory .",
    "creagh and whelan have shown how to explicitly build such a wavepacket  @xcite . for a quantum chaotic system ,",
    "the simplest model for describing the statistical properties of the energy spectrum and eigenstates is to use random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite .",
    "there , it is assumed that any unknown matrix element will be statistically described by a gaussian distribution . in our case , although the system is not time - reversal invariant ( because of the magnetic field ) , it has a generalized time - reversal symmetry and the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrices must be used .",
    "thus the matrix element is purely real and its square , and consequently the ionization rate , will be described by a porter - thomas distribution  @xcite : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the mean value of @xmath100 , unity in our case . in fig .",
    "[ stat - m3 ] , we show the numerically obtained distribution for the @xmath86 series compared with the porter - thomas prediction , on a double - logarithmic scale which is more convenient to display the large fluctuations .",
    "the agreement is excellent , which proves that the distribution of ionization rates in our realistic problem can be quantitatively predicted , using a combination of semiclassics ( for the mean value ) and random matrix theory ( for the fluctuations ) .",
    "the results for the @xmath70 series are shown in fig .",
    "[ stat - m0 ] .",
    "the overall agreement is rather good , with a clear @xmath101 behavior at small @xmath100 and an exponentially small tail at large @xmath102 however , a significant deviation is clearly visible at intermediate values .",
    "what is the origin of this deviation ?",
    "we have been able to show that it is directly related to the unstable periodic orbits inside the chaotic potential well .",
    "the quantitative interpretation is based on the semiclassical prediction , eqs .",
    "( [ cw1]-[cw4 ] ) .",
    "a clue is provided by a careful inspection of fig .",
    "[ unscaled ] which shows that fluctuations around the average trend are not random but clearly display a short - range oscillation ( about 100 oscillations in the covered range ) .",
    "the simplest way of measuring this oscillations is to perform a fourier transform with respect to @xmath103 a standard tool in periodic orbit theory .",
    "we define : @xmath104 where the sum is taken over some range of @xmath105 of length @xmath106 the function @xmath107 is shown in fig .",
    "[ ft ] both for @xmath70 and @xmath108 as expected , @xmath109 is very close to unity ( this proves that the actual average width is well predicted by the semiclassical formula , eq .",

    "@xmath107 has a very large peak around @xmath110 with harmonics at integer multiples , but also smaller peaks at other values . from eq .",
    "( [ cw4 ] ) , the peaks are expected to take place at the actions of the periodic orbits inside the well which are real continuations of the imaginary instanton . in our case , this orbit is entirely along the @xmath27 axis and its classical action @xmath111 is easily computed .",
    "we find @xmath112 for the parameters of the figure , in perfect agreement with the numerical quantum calculation .",
    "it should be noticed that we use for the classical calculation the scaled energy -0.1005 ,",
    "i.e. the value of the _ modified _ scaled energy of the quantum calculation .",

    "the fact that both agree validates our correction and fully confirms the important role of the zero - point transverse energy .",
    "the semiclassical formula  ( [ cw4 ] ) also predicts the amplitude of the peak that should be observed in the fourier transform @xmath113 there is however an important subtlety here .",
    "the monodromy matrix of the real orbit along the @xmath27 axis enters the formula .",
    "it turns out that , because the orbit is very close to the saddle point ( reached at @xmath114 it undergoes an infinite series of bifurcation as @xmath115 at closely spaced @xmath33 values , the orbit loses and regains stability . at each bifurcation",
    ", a new periodic orbit is born , which is off the @xmath27 axis , but close to it .",
    "such a phenomenon is well known when a particle either approaches a saddle point ( see for example the henon - heiles model in  @xcite ) or explores a channel with a long - range potential , as for example is the case for a rydberg series converging to an ionization threshold  @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ trace ] the trace of the stability matrix of the @xmath27 orbit as a function of the scaled energy @xmath33 for @xmath59 which clearly shows this series of stable - unstable bifurcations .",
    "however , we also plot on the same figure the denominator of the semiclassical contribution , eq .",
    "( [ cw4 ] ) , to the ionization rate , whose calculation is detailed in the appendix .",
    "the fact that what counts is not the real orbit itself but its combination with the instanton completely eliminates the series of bifurcations and gives a smooth contribution as the scaled energy is varied , as observed in the numerical quantum experiment .",
    "moreover , the semiclassical formula  ( [ cw4 ] ) predicts for @xmath107 a peak at @xmath112 with amplitude 0.592 , while the numerical result is @xmath116 in excellent agreement .",
    "similarly , the harmonics of the peak form approximately a geometric series with amplitude @xmath117 for the @xmath118 repetition of the primitive real orbit .",
    "the physical interpretation is clear : because the motion in the inner potential well is chaotic , each time the quantum particle leaves the vicinity of the saddle point ( along the @xmath27 axis ) , it explores some part of the chaotic phase space and roughly only 59% of the electronic density is reflected by the nucleus back along the @xmath27 axis .",
    "it is important to remark that the oscillations of the widths , eq .",
    "( [ cw4 ] ) , induced by the orbit along the @xmath27 axis and all its repetitions add _ coherently_. indeed , if we assume for simplicity that the @xmath118 repetition contributes with amplitude @xmath119 ( with @xmath120 in our case ) and phase @xmath121 , the series , including the smooth term @xmath122 can be summed exactly , leading to the following contribution to the ionization width : @xmath123 this , in turn , predicts that the average normalized widths are not uniformly distributed , but should follow the distribution : @xmath124 the physical interpretation of this distribution is simple .",
    "it is nothing , but the function giving the intensity transmitted through a fabry - perot optical cavity with reflexion coefficients @xmath125 for the combination of the two mirrors , phase shift @xmath126 at the reflections and optical length @xmath127 in units of the wavelength .",
    "this is of course a _ periodic _ function of the variable @xmath105 with period @xmath128 it has maxima at @xmath129 equal to an integer multiple of @xmath130  where the value of the function is @xmath131  and minima at half - integer multiples where the function is @xmath132 if @xmath125 is large , the maxima are sharp peaks .",
    "the analogy with the fabry - perot cavity is more than formal : it actually describes how the electronic density can be resonantly trapped inside the inner potential well along the @xmath27 axis , resulting in enhanced tunneling amplitude and ionization rate . because the dynamics is chaotic",
    ", such a resonant enhancement is only partial ( @xmath125 must be smaller than unity ) resulting in scarring of the wavefunction rather than complete localization .    in order to test whether this distribution adequately describes the numerical result ,",
    "we have  folded \" all the numerical values @xmath96 inside a single  free spectral range \" of the fabry - perot cavity , by plotting them against : @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the fractional part of the number @xmath135 the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fp ] . clearly the largest @xmath96 values are grouped around a well defined @xmath136 value , as expected .",
    "large fluctuations still exist ; in order to smooth them , we plot also the running average ( over 100 values ) which clearly presents a resonant behavior around @xmath137 the semiclassical prediction , using the @xmath125 value deduced from the classical stability of the orbit , is shown as a dashed line and agrees fairly well with the numerical result .",
    "this proves that the orbit along the @xmath27 axis plays the dominant role in our problem . to be completely honest",
    ", we must mention that the phase @xmath138 , which is directly related to the position of the maximum in the plot , has not been extracted from the classical dynamics but fitted to the numerical data .",
    "the last step is to characterize precisely the fluctuations of the _ individual _ widths that appear on top of the global exponential decrease and the modulations discussed above .",
    "such fluctuations are thought to be unavoidable in a chaotic system , and are even a signature of the presence of chaos . in a semiclassical point of view , they can be seen as the effect of the whole set of ( unstable ) periodic orbits in the inner potential well .",
    "each orbit approaching the saddle point contributes an oscillatory term analogous to eq .",
    "( [ cw4 ] ) to the width and the individual widths are just the result of the superposition of plenty of such terms which oscillate rapidly : it results in apparently random fluctuations around the mean value .",
    "a number of peaks are visible in the fourier transformed spectra in fig .  [",
    "ft ] ; semiclassical theory tells us that they appear at the actions of periodic orbits . in our specific case ,",
    "it is visible that most of them are clustered at actions slightly smaller than the action of the @xmath27 orbit and its repetitions .",
    "physically , they correspond to orbits mainly located close to the @xmath27 axis , born from the @xmath27 orbit at the bifurcations discussed above .",
    "there is actually a very large number of such orbits with similar shapes , but differing by small details .",
    "thus , it is in general difficult to associate a peak in the fourier transform with a single periodic orbit .",
    "except for the lowest members , we could not assign unambiguously such peaks .",
    "this is not a simple problem : indeed , many orbits are very close in phase space and , for a finite value of @xmath139 can not be considered as isolated in the sense that the saddle point approximation around each orbit  a key ingredient of periodic orbit theory  is not valid .",
    "in such circumstances , it is not possible to separate the contributions of the various orbits which have to be grouped together using for example a uniform approximation  @xcite .",
    "note that this is a fundamental difficulty of periodic orbit theory , not a practical problem related to the proliferation of the number of orbits .",
    "an interesting illustration of this problem may be obtained by launching a bunch of trajectories from the section @xmath140 close to the saddle point . following the real trajectories ( all started with positive momentum in @xmath27 )",
    "until they hit again the same plane @xmath140 with positive momentum one can get a feeling of the relevant dynamics .",
    "for a fully chaotic system one could naively expect that a plot of say actions calculated along the trajectory versus the initial momentum along the @xmath27 axis will not show any structure .",
    "this is not true in our system as visualized in fig .",
    "[ traj ] . observe a strongly not ergodic behaviour with allowed actions forming almost parallel strips .",
    "a clear accumulation of actions in strips correlate nicely with peaks in the fourier transform , fig .",
    "[ ft](a ) , in the range just below the second repetition at @xmath141 of the straight line periodic orbit . to each strip , apart from other non - periodic trajectories , several periodic orbits contribute which slightly differ in shape ( and action ) .",
    "as mentioned already this makes a clear association between peaks in the fourier transform and given periodic orbits impossible .",
    "the basic assumption , usual in studies of quantum chaos , is that the effect of long periodic orbits is to create fluctuations well described by random matrix theory . as ",
    "see above  the ionization rate appears as the square of some real matrix elements , the simplest hypothesis is to assume that the fluctuations are described by a porter - thomas distribution , eq .",
    "( [ pt ] ) . however , the mean value @xmath99 is now taken as predicted by the semiclassical theory , i.e. eq .  ( [ ysc ] ) . as the @xmath142 values are uniformly distributed ,",
    "this results in a global statistical distribution : @xmath143 where @xmath144    this distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "[ stat - m0 ] as a solid line .",
    "it clearly very significantly improves over the porter - thomas distribution and is in excellent agreement with our numerical data .",
    "especially , it correctly describes the excess of large ionization widths .",
    "the same approach can be used for the data in other @xmath64 series . however , as is obvious in fig .",
    "[ ft](b ) , the contribution of the @xmath27 orbit is much smaller in e.g. the @xmath86 series .",
    "as mentioned above , this is well understood semiclassically . in simple words ,",
    "as the centrifugal term is more important , it keeps the electron away from the @xmath27 axis and strongly diminishes the contribution of this orbit .",
    "the @xmath125 parameter for the @xmath86 series can be extracted from the fourier transform in fig .",
    "[ ft](b ) and is close to 0.1 . the semiclassical prediction , which can be calculated in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , is @xmath145 ^ 4\\approx 0.12 $ ] in reasonably good agreement .",
    "for such a small @xmath125 value , the deviation of the distribution  ( [ modified_pt ] ) from porter - thomas is very small .",
    "this explains why the porter - thomas distribution correctly reproduces the results of the numerical experiment , see fig .",
    "[ stat - m3 ] .",
    "we have also obtained results for the @xmath146 and @xmath147 series , shown in figs .",
    "[ stat - m1 ] and [ stat - m2 ] .",
    "significant deviations from porter - thomas are observed , although smaller than for the @xmath70 series .",
    "again , the modified distribution , eq .",
    "( [ modified_pt ] ) , agrees very well with the numerical results .",
    "an alternative approach to the statistical properties of the ionization widths is possible . from the semiclassical approach , we know both the average trend and the modulations ; we can thus subtract ( or rather divide ) these factors out in order to concentrate on the fluctuations .",
    "we thus rescale the numerical data to the expected average+oscillatory behavior , that is define : @xmath148 with @xmath99 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ ysc ] ) .    the statistical distribution of the @xmath27 variable is shown in fig .",
    "[ pz - m0 ] , for the @xmath70 series .",
    "as can be seen , it agrees very well with a pure porter - thomas distribution .",
    "this fully confirms that , once the average and oscillatory behavior have been properly taken into account , only the standard fluctuations described by random matrix theory persist .",
    "finally , we have studied a slightly less realistic system : the two - dimensional hydrogen atom in parallel electric and magnetic fields , obtained from the previous system by imposing that the motion takes place in the @xmath149 plane .",
    "the classical dynamics is _ exactly _ the same than for @xmath70 states ( obviously the motion is planar for such cases ) .",
    "one could thus naively expect the same properties for the ionization widths for the quantum system .",
    "this is however not entirely true for two reasons :    * the zero - point transverse motion is now in one dimension instead of two .",
    "thus , the shift energy is reduced by a factor 2 compared to eq .",
    "( [ shift ] ) : @xmath150 the modified scaled energy , eq .",
    "( [ hat_epsilon ] ) , must be modified accordingly . *",
    "the stability matrix is a @xmath151 matrix instead of a @xmath152 matrix .",
    "as explained in the appendix , this results in a denominators in eqs .",
    "( [ cw1])-([cw4 ] ) , to be square roots of the three - dimensional results for @xmath153    the net effect is that the instability of the real orbit in the potential well is significantly reduced , simply because there is less space for the electron to escape far from the @xmath27 axis .",
    "the analysis is similar to the three - dimensional @xmath70 case , with the parameter @xmath125 being now taken at power 1/2 , i.e. @xmath154 instead of @xmath155 stronger deviations from the porter - thomas distribution are thus expected for the @xmath156 figs .",
    "[ stat-2d ] and [ pz-2d ] show that it is indeed the case .",
    "once more , the agreement with the modified porter - thomas distribution , eq .",
    "( [ modified_pt ] ) is very good .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the widths ( ionization rates ) of resonances of a realistic system , the hydrogen atom in parallel electric and magnetic fields , in conditions where the classical dynamics is chaotic .",
    "we have shown that , using a semiclassical approach without any adjustable parameter but only with classical ingredients , we are able to predict analytically the average behavior of the widths .",
    "we have also shown the existence of a modulation of the average width associated with a periodic orbit and calculated quantitatively its properties , again using only classical ingredients .",
    "finally , the residual fluctuations have been shown to be accurately described by a random matrix model .",
    "this proves that a proper combination of semiclassics and random matrix theory can _ predict _ the behavior of the system vs. ionization .",
    "our results are comparable to the ones obtained on a model system in  @xcite .",
    "for example , their fig .  1 is clearly comparable to our fig .",
    "note however that , due to the specificities of our _ realistic _ system , the expressions we obtain have a simpler form . on a different model system ,",
    "bies et al .",
    "@xcite observed also deviations from the porter - thomas distribution .",
    "part of the deviation is due to the relatively small value of the effective planck constant , but another part is certainly due to scarring . their figs .",
    "4 and 5 are again very comparable to our fig .",
    "[ fp ] . because they do not consider a scaling system , the classical dynamics  and consequently the properties of the periodic orbits ",
    "change with energy which makes a comparison with our distribution rather difficult .",
    "we however have little doubt that the basic process at work is similar to ours .",
    "we are grateful to niall whelan and stephen creagh for an initial stimulation to look at tunneling in parallel fields problem .",
    "we thank w.e .",
    "bies , l. kaplan and e.j .",
    "heller for permission to use their data for our manipulations .",

    "cpu time on various computers has been provided by idris .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss how the various classical quantities which enter the semiclassical formula can be calculated in our specific system , the hydrogen atom in parallel electric and magnetic fields .      as we are interested in highly excited states lying in the immediate vicinity of the saddle point energy , it is convenient to expand the hamiltonian at second order around the saddle point . the normal modes of this harmonic approximation are along the @xmath27 axis and in the @xmath61 plane . in the @xmath61 plane ,",
    "the saddle point is a potential minimum associated with a vibration frequency : @xmath159 because of the azimuthal symmetry around the fields axis , this mode is degenerate . in order to have a chaotic motion in the inner potential well ,",
    "the scaled energy must be large , typically of the order of -0.1 , which in turns implies that @xmath34 is rather small .",
    "in most cases , one can thus forget the @xmath34 dependence in eq .",
    "( [ omegarho ] ) and use the approximation : @xmath160    along the @xmath27 axis , the saddle point is a potential _ maximum_.",
    "it is thus associated with an eigenmode with purely imaginary frequency @xmath161 where : @xmath162 the corresponding imaginary period is nothing , but the period of the instanton .",
    "alternatively , @xmath163 can be viewed as the vibration frequency around the saddle point in the _ inverted _ potential . in an harmonic potential ,",
    "the action of an orbit is simply ( within a @xmath130 factor ) the ratio of its excitation energy ( with respect to the equilibrium point ) to the frequency .",
    "this yields the ( imaginary ) action of the instanton given by eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) .",
    "the harmonic approximation around the saddle point can also be used for the calculation of the stability matrix of the instanton .",
    "indeed , as the harmonic potential separates completely in a transverse and a longitudinal component , the monodromy matrix of the instanton in each transverse direction , after propagation during time @xmath164 is simply of the form : @xmath165 the stability matrix of the instanton is obtained by evaluating the monodromy matrix at the period of the instanton @xmath166 @xmath167      for the three - dimensional hydrogen atom , the stability matrix is a @xmath170 matrix which actually splits in two @xmath151 identical blocks ( along the @xmath136 and @xmath100 directions ) of type  ( [ w ] ) .",
    "thus , the contribution ( [ det ] ) must be squared to get the correct semiclassical contribution .",
    "in contrast , for the simplified two - dimensional model , there is only one such contribution .",
    "the last ingredient in the semiclassical approximation is the stability matrix of the real periodic orbit in the inner potential well .",
    "as explained in the main text , the series of bifurcations taking place in the vicinity of the saddle point energy implies that this matrix changes rapidly with @xmath74 on the other hand , when @xmath33 is varied , the dynamics inside the potential well is only weakly affected : the main effect is that the electron spends less or more time in the immediate vicinity on the saddle point .",
    "as the transverse potential is there rather steep , the stability matrix varies a lot .",
    "these modifications are essentially described by a multiplication by a matrix similar to ( [ mono ] ) .",
    "a small variation of the period of the orbit is enough to affect strongly the matrix .",
    "however , it is the product of the stability matrices of the instanton and the real periodic orbit which describes the semiclassical contribution , eq .",
    "( [ cw4 ] ) .",
    "as it is the very same matrix type  ( [ mono ] ) which contributes to the two stability matrix , it turns out that the _ modulus _ of @xmath171 actually depends weakly on @xmath33 as shown in fig .",
