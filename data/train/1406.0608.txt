    "a new stage of the history of radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars discovery began with the launch of fermi satellite on june 11 , 2008 . prior to that , the geminga pulsar  @xcite stayed , for a long time , as the only identified gamma - ray pulsar without a detectable radio counterpart . the fermi large area telescopy ( lat ) data enabled to discover 34 more gamma - ray pulsars with both time - differencing technique  @xcite and a novel semi - coherent method  @xcite .",
    "at present , 77 non - recycled pulsars are identified by fermi lat , 42 of which are radio - loud , see  @xcite for review .",
    "there are two general classes of gamma - ray pulsar models , namely the polar cap  ( pc ) and the outer magnetosphere  ( om ) models .",
    "the classes are characterized by a location of the origin of high - energy emission . in the pc model",
    "@xcite the gamma rays are produced by electrons accelerated in the polar cap region near the surface of the neutron star . in the second class of models ,",
    "electrons are accelerated in outer regions of the pulsar magnetosphere  @xcite ( see also @xcite for recent magnetosphere modeling results ) .",
    "a description of radio - quiet pulsars is different in two model classes . in pc models , gamma - ray and radio beams",
    "are produced in the same region and co - directed . in these models , pulsars are observed as radio - quiet only if existing radio survey sensitivity is not sufficient to detect radio emission  @xcite . in the om gamma - ray and radio beams naturally possess different geometry , which leads to a geometrical explanation of radio - quietness  @xcite .",
    "there is still an open question whether both radio - quiet and radio - loud pulsars belong to the same population of astronomical objects .",
    "it was noted that radio - quiet fraction is lower for young pulsars  @xcite .",
    "this observation may be interpreted as the time evolution of the width of the radio beam  @xcite .",
    "still the selection effects may be important as the radio - quiet pulsars are identified with a completely different procedure than radio - loud . in order to exclude this possible bias in population studies ,",
    "we build here the gamma - ray selected catalog of pulsars applying the same blind search procedure to all fermi - lat point sources , independently on the information known from radio or optical observation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] , the fermi lat data analysis is explained .",
    "the photon list is build for each of the fermi - lat point sources . in section  [ sec : method ] , we overview the search method used for the blind search of pulsations .",
    "further we estimate the threshold for the value of @xmath1-test in order to exclude a single false detection with a probability of at least 90% .",
    "the gamma - ray selected pulsar catalog and the discussion of the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we use the fermi lat pass 7 ( v6 ) publicly available weekly all - sky data for the period from 2008 august 4 to 2013 march 6 , corresponding to the mission elapsed time ( met ) from 239557418 to 384261063s  @xcite .",
    "we select `` source '' class events with energies from 100mev to 300gev and apply the standard quality cuts using _ fermi science tools v9r27p1_. we require that zenith angle and satellite rocking angle do not exceed @xmath2 and @xmath3 correspondingly .",
    "we use all 1861 point sources from the fermi lat second source catalog ( 2fgl )  @xcite as the candidates for the search .",
    "no preselection of the sources based on the known type and properties is performed .",
    "we use coordinates of the sources from 2fgl , although for many sources the position is known better from other observations .",
    "this is a price we pay for the blindness of the search to all data , except gamma - ray radiation .",
    "we note , however , that the eficiency of the pulsar search grows substantially if one includes the scan over the sky location  @xcite .",
    "the position variation requires more computational resources and therefore the search in this paper is limited to fixed positions .    for each source",
    "we build a source model which includes 2fgl sources in a @xmath4 radius circle , galactic and isotropic diffuse emission components ( version p7v6 ) .",
    "we fit fermi lat events in a circle of @xmath4 with a model by _ gtlike _ tool using unbinned likelihood analysis .",
    "the probability for each photon to be originated from the source under consideration is obtained by _ gtsrcprob _ tool .",
    "this probability is used in the following analysis as a weight of the event . for each source",
    "we keep 12000 events with the highest weights .",
    "the barycentric corrections to photon arrival times are applied with _",
    "-test statistic for 2fgl identified blazars .",
    "dashed line represents an exponential fit of the tail.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the search for pulsations is performed by summing up the spectral power over sub - intervals of time range .",
    "we scan over pulsar frequency @xmath5 and spin - down rate @xmath6 using the set of photon barycentric arrival times @xmath7 and corresponding weights @xmath8 .",
    "the observation time range is split into @xmath9 intervals of length @xmath10s , where the last interval is padded with zero flux up to the length @xmath11 .",
    "first , the arrival times , measured in met seconds , are corrected with    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14s ( mjd 55225 ) is a reference epoch .",
    "we further bin each time interval into @xmath15 bins and define @xmath16 as the sum of photon weights in the @xmath17-th bin for the @xmath18-th time interval .",
    "then , the spectrum @xmath19 in the @xmath18-th interval is obtained with a discrete fourier transform @xmath20 where @xmath21 and the nyquist frequency is @xmath22 .",
    "the fourier transform is performed with the open - source fast fourier transform library _ fftw _",
    "finally , the statistic @xmath23 is defined as a sum of squares of fourier densities over m time intervals @xmath24    we scan over the parameter @xmath25 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 with a step equal to @xmath28 .",
    "the range corresponds to the pulsar characteristic age greater than @xmath29kyr .",
    "the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 corresponding to the highest @xmath23 are then fine - adjusted by finding a local maximum of the weighted @xmath1-test statistic  @xcite .",
    "the latter is defined coherently on the whole time - interval as follows :    @xmath30\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 is a fourier amplitude of the @xmath32-th harmonic , @xmath33     plot for 25 pulsars found with a blind search in the present _",
    "paper_. @xmath34 is a rotation period .",
    "the search is limited to characteristic ages @xmath35kyr which correspond to the area below the solid line.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we define the detection threshold @xmath36 in such a way that the probability to have a single false candidate in the whole set does not exceed @xmath37 . as the distribution of @xmath1-test statistic for non - pulsating objects is not known a priori , we construct an estimate for the particular procedure of our scan .",
    "we produce a distribution of @xmath1-test for 806 2fgl sources identified as blazars , see fig .",
    "[ histo ] .",
    "the tail of the distribution is approximated with an exponential function and then the value @xmath38 follows from the requirement that the integral of extrapolated distribution above @xmath36 is equal to @xmath39 .",
    "the above background estimation technique is based on the complete scan procedure and therefore naturally accounts for data - selection and scans .",
    "note that the threshold determination required us to involve the sources identification information , but this does not impact detection uniformity as @xmath36 is a constant for all sources in the search .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the comparison of distributions over galactic coordinates , gamma - ray energy flux and spin - down luminosity indicate that both radio - loud and radio - quiet pulsars belong to the same population , see table  [ tbl : ks ] .",
    "the agreement of the parameter distributions is an additional argument in favor of the geometrical origin of radio - quietness and therefore om pulsar models are preferable . on the contrary",
    ", the pc models unavoidably result in a strong age dependence of the fraction of radio - quiet pulsars .",
    "given that fermi lat has by now observed 42 non - recycled radio - loud pulsars , we expect according to our value of @xmath40 that there are about 75 radio - quiet pulsars among the fermi - lat sources .",
    "the pulsed emission is discovered for only 35 of them leaving @xmath41 sources as a challenge for the future pulsation searches . in accord with our result ,",
    "the machine - learning classification of fermi - lat unidentified sources points to more than 50 gamma - pulsar candidates  @xcite .",
