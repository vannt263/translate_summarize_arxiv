    "more than 30 years after their discovery , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) remain one of the most outstanding puzzles in astrophysics .",
    "a `` relativistic fireball '' model has emerged to explain the @xmath3-ray emission and successfully predict the existence of longer wavelength afterglows .",
    "however , the identity , or identities , of the central engine driving such fireballs is literally shrouded in uncertainty .",
    "at least two major problems stalk the proposed grb models .",
    "firstly , extreme isotropic energies are implied by the cosmological distances of some bursts , determined from redshifted absorption lines in their afterglows .",
    "secondly , the `` baryon loading - compactness problem '' results from the large energies , small sizes ( implied by short timescale variability ) and optically thin spectra of grbs and requires the source to move towards us highly relativistically .",
    "this in turn mandates miniscule mass - loading , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the isotropic @xmath3-ray energy in units of @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the mean lorentz factor of the source mass ( @xmath8 is the mean velocity relative to the speed of light ) and @xmath9 is the conversion efficiency of bulk kinetic energy to @xmath3-rays ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "one mechanism that can naturally overcome these hurdles is the acceleration of shocks in a progenitor , which confines and efficiently taps the energy from a central explosion resulting from the formation of a compact stellar mass object .",
    "although the shock is initially non- or mildly relativistic , it may accelerate to relativistic velocities and channel a fraction of the total explosion energy into relativistic ejecta .",
    "shock acceleration occurs in the presence of a steeply declining density gradient , and so only a small fraction of the ejecta mass reaches relativistic speeds .",
    "this mechanism has provided the basis for many different models of grbs , ranging from normal supernovae ( in the first astrophysical grb model ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to extremely energetic supernovae or `` hypernovae '' @xcite , to phase transitions of neutron stars into strange stars @xcite .",
    "accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs to neutron stars @xcite may also drive a shock into the outer atmosphere of the white dwarf , but such shocks have so far been examined only in the context of much weaker type ia supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "shock acceleration is also an important factor in aspherical models such as those involving rotationally flattened progenitors @xcite and jet - like explosions of the core @xcite .",
    "even if a jet pierces the stellar envelope entirely ( as in the model of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the production of relativistic ejecta by shock acceleration may dominate the observed grb in most directions .    while the propagation of shock waves is well understood in the nonrelativistic @xcite and ultrarelativistic @xcite regimes",
    ", similarity solutions do not exist for the mildly relativistic case .",
    "thus , previous analytic models of the acceleration of shocks at these intermediate velocities have extrapolated nonrelativistic results with simple scaling laws ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) intermediate between the non- and ultrarelativistic limits .",
    "furthermore , the postshock evolution of trans - relativistic ejecta has received only a crude treatment , if any , in previous work .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a quantitative , theoretical description of trans - relativistic shock and postshock acceleration , which will be of use in many grb models .",
    "trans - relativistic blast wave _ is one in which some of the mass is accelerated to highly relativistic velocities , but most of the mass is not ; in particular the ratio of the explosion energy to the rest energy of the ejecta is @xmath10 . in  [ s : theory ] , utilizing a relativistic one - dimensional lagrangian hydrodynamic code based on the method of exact riemann solvers @xcite , we investigate the dynamics of shocks and shocked ejecta in idealized model density distributions .",
    "we present physically motivated analytic approximations to describe the shock and postshock acceleration as well as the kinetic energy distribution of ejecta from density distributions approximating polytropes at their edges .",
    "we explore how a progenitor s structure affects its ejecta in ",
    "[ s : whips ] , finding that highly condensed envelopes produce fast or relativistic ejecta most efficiently and that this corresponds to stars whose luminosities approach the eddington limit .",
    "we present formulae to estimate the energy in relativistic ejecta from the parameters of a given progenitor star .",
    "our results , although primarily derived for spherically symmetric explosions , can also be applied to sectors of aspherical explosions , a topic we address in  [",
    "s : aspherical ] .",
    "explosions where the effect of gravity is strong , for example relevant to ejecta from neutron stars , are treated in ",
    "[ s : wd / ns - theory ] .",
    "we apply our results to four astrophysical examples , as potential grb engines (  [ s : applications ] ) .",
    "first , and in most detail , we consider supernova explosions in the exposed cores of massive post main - sequence stars (  [ s:98bw ] )",
    ". the probable association of supernova ( sn ) 1998bw with grb 980425 @xcite has sparked renewed interest in such models .",
    "other supernovae for which a suspicion of grb association exists include sn 1997cy with grb 970514 @xcite and sn 1999e with grb 980901 @xcite . the late time excess flux , relative to that expected from a power - law decline , of the afterglows of grb 970228 @xcite and grb 980326 @xcite has been cited as evidence for the presence of supernovae @xcite .",
    "however , alternative mechanisms of afterglow re - radiation @xcite and scattering @xcite by dust , have also been proposed to produce the excess flux .",
    "cosmological grb afterglows are associated with the stellar population of their host galaxies @xcite , but there is only tentative evidence for a direct association with star forming regions @xcite , which would be expected if they arose from the deaths of massive stars .",
    "if there is an association between grb 980425 and sn 1998bw , then the @xmath3-ray energy is only @xmath11 , thousands to millions of times weaker than the inferred isotropic energies of the cosmological bursts ; moreover , its associated galaxy is much too near to be drawn from the same distribution as the other known host galaxies @xcite .",
    "this event may be an example of a subclass of grbs , termed s - grbs @xcite .",
    "@xcite simulated an energetic ( @xmath12 ) explosion in a variety of carbon - oxygen and helium star progenitors , attempting to fit the observed supernova lightcurve .",
    "they considered the possibilities of @xmath3-ray emission from shock break - out and the interaction of ejecta with a circumstellar wind . with nonrelativistic codes they found the simple spherical case unable to produce enough relativistic ejecta to account for even this weak grb .",
    "this result , together with the extremely large isotropic energies ( @xmath13 ) of the cosmological bursts , has focussed attention on aspherical explosions involving jets , which may be able to explain the different types of grbs as a function of the viewing angle to the jet @xcite .",
    "however , uncertainties in previous models of trans - relativistic dynamics warrant further investigation of the simplest spherical case . indeed , our relativistic analysis of the model considered by @xcite yields sufficient mildly relativistic ejecta to account for grb 980425 and radio observations of sn 1998bw , for a progenitor embedded in a dense wind with mass loss rate @xmath14 .",
    "our analysis therefore validates the suggestion by @xcite that grb 980425 could be the product of a _ spherical _ explosion of sn 1998bw .",
    "in  [ s : c - grbs ] we continue with explosions in the cores of massive stars , but now at much greater energies .",
    "these hypernovae are hypothesized to result from magnetic extraction of the rotational energy of nascent neutron stars or black holes @xcite .",
    "we consider an extreme example with @xmath15 , which might arise from the formation of a @xmath16 black hole .",
    "for the purposes of this crude estimate , we embed the explosion in the @xmath17 envelope ejected from our sn 1998bw progenitor , and calculate the resulting energy distribution . to compare to the observed cosmological bursts we derive conservative constraints on the minimum mean lorentz factor of ejecta carrying the @xmath3-ray energy , by considering the timescale of the burst , and requiring the implied circumstellar material to be optically thin to the burst photons .",
    "we also consider the minimum lorentz factor required for the optical depth due to photon - photon pair production to be small .",
    "we find that the overall energetics and relativistic ejecta velocities required by many cosmological bursts can be explained by such a simple , though admittedly extreme , model .",
    "however there are some events , notably grb 990123 , that lie well beyond the reach of the spherical model . considering aspherical explosions (  [ s : aspherical ] ) , we calculate that enhancements in shock strength along the preferred axis , perhaps set by rotation , by factors of only a few are required to explain all cosmological grbs .",
    "interaction of the relativistic ejecta with inhomogeneities may give bursts some short timescale substructure @xcite , though this can only account for a small fraction of the total burst energy @xcite .",
    "instabilities associated with an accelerating shock @xcite may create postshock velocity perturbations that also lead to grb variability .",
    "finally we consider simple models of explosions in white dwarfs and neutron stars (  [ s : wdns ] ) , in order to investigate shock and postshock acceleration in their outer layers .",
    "such shocks may be driven by the accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf to a neutron star or the phase transition of a neutron star to a hypothesized `` strange '' star , composed of more stable strange quark matter . for the production of relativistic ejecta , these models have the advantage that large explosion energies may be coupled to very small ejecta masses .",
    "given a total ejecta mass and energy , as predicted from detailed core - collapse models @xcite , we estimate the energy distribution of the ejecta . again",
    ", we find enhanced amounts of energy in relativistic ejecta compared to previous estimates . we compare to cosmological grbs , this time by combining the burst timescale with an assumed density of a uniform ambient medium .",
    "we find that white dwarf explosions are unlikely to be relevant to these bursts .",
    "our neutron star models , while more energetic , need to be pushed to extreme limits to provide observable fluxes at cosmological distances .",
    "the process of mass ejection in a supernova explosion proceeds in a sequence of distinct dynamical phases @xcite . in the first phase ,",
    "the stellar envelope is engulfed by the outward - propagating blast wave launched by collapse of the core . except perhaps in the vicinity of the central engine and within the shock itself , the blast wave is adiabatic . for an explosion in the tenuous outer envelope of a supernova ,",
    "the postshock pressure is dominated by photons ; for a relativistic shock in a compact object , it may be dominated by relativistic motions of leptons @xcite . in either case , the ratio of specific heats is @xmath18 .",
    "the boundary of this blast wave is a shock front , which imprints its velocity ( and an associated specific entropy ) on the postshock gas .",
    "the shock velocity decreases in most parts of the star , but it increases in regions with a sufficiently steep density profile  an effect analogous to the cracking of a whip . as the postshock pressure is dominated by radiation pressure , the shock front has a finite optical depth ( for which photons diffuse upstream as fast as gas flows downstream ) .",
    "thus the shock breaks out of the star at some finite depth . only for a sufficiently energetic explosion in a sufficiently compact star will the shock accelerate to relativistic velocities before it breaks out . in  [",
    "s : shockprop ] we investigate shock acceleration in such progenitors .",
    "after the stellar envelope has been shocked , its thermal and kinetic energies are approximately equal .",
    "the next phase of evolution is one of postshock acceleration , in which heat is converted into outward motion and the ejecta approach a state of free expansion . for the gas in the outer layers of the star ,",
    "this increases the velocity by over a factor of two compared to the postshock state if the shock is nonrelativistic @xcite . however , gas hit by a relativistic shock undergoes even more dramatic acceleration , because postshock kinetic and thermal energy densities are both dominated by photons , which eventually transfer their energy to the baryons in the freely expanding state .",
    "this conversion of internal energy to kinetic leads to a large increase in the lorentz factor during the acceleration phase .",
    "the acceleration is accentuated by the fact that each gas element is pushed outward by interior ejecta , which though slower , are at higher pressure (  [ shacc ] ) .",
    "each stage of this process has been the study of previous theoretical investigations ; our goal is to investigate in greater detail the connection between the shock velocity and the final expansion velocity , across the transition from newtonian to relativistic motion . to describe this process analytically , we present formulae that have been calibrated against numerical simulations for a variety of progenitor stars (   [ s : shockprop ] and [ shacc ] ) . in  [ s : kedist ] we give an analytical prediction of the distribution of energy with lorentz factor in the state of free expansion , i.e. , the information necessary to calculate the circumstellar interaction and the resulting burst of energetic radiation .",
    "we consider the dependence of relativistic mass ejection on the progenitor s structure in ",
    "[ s : whips ] .",
    "we apply our dynamical results to sectors of aspherical explosions in  [ s : aspherical ] and explosions where the ejecta are strongly affected by gravity in  [",
    "s : wd / ns - theory ] .",
    "the propagation of a nonrelativistic blast wave through the stellar interior and the subsequent acceleration phase were studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "the shock velocity , @xmath19 , responds to two competing trends .",
    "first is the overall deceleration as mass is entrained through the shock , @xmath20^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath21 is the fraction of the total ejecta mass , @xmath22 , within @xmath23 ( excluding any remnant mass @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 is the injected energy in units of the rest energy , which is @xmath26 for trans - relativistic explosions .",
    "second is the acceleration of the shock front down the declining density gradient , for which @xmath27^{{\\alpha_{\\rm nr}}}$ ] where @xmath28 for typical outer density distributions @xcite .",
    "the shock propagation is a combination of these two trends , and it is not surprising that a product of the two formulae yields an excellent approximation to the shock velocity @xcite : @xmath29    the coefficient @xmath30 can be evaluated for a spherical sedov blast wave in the distribution @xmath31 , in which it takes the value @xmath32 where @xmath33 , constant for self - similar blast waves , measures the fraction of the explosion energy that is kinetic .",
    "note that the shock accelerates in this region only if @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite found that the primakoff distribution @xmath35 ( for which @xmath36 ) adequately describes the interiors of red and blue supergiant progenitors of type ii supernovae .",
    "however , we have found that the accuracy of equation ( [ nonrelshock ] ) is enhanced if @xmath30 is evaluated for the typical value of @xmath37 in the interior of progenitor . to make this evaluation",
    ", we use the pressure gradient approximation of @xcite , with @xmath18 : @xmath38 which is exact for the primakoff blast wave , @xmath39 . for the progenitor model co6 of @xcite , which we use to simulate sn 1998bw (  [ s:98bw ] ) , we estimate @xmath40 which gives @xmath41 .",
    "we also consider the velocity normalization for shocks that develop in centrally concentrated , non - power - law distributions , with monotonically steepening density gradients as @xmath42 .",
    "these types of distribution mimic those of white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "we estimate a mean @xmath37 in the central region , where the shock structure forms , by evaluating a moment of the whole density distribution , @xmath43 . for a power law distribution @xmath44 from numerical simulation ( below ) , we find @xmath45 gives an estimate of an effective @xmath37 which accurately predicts @xmath30 , via equations ( [ anr ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) , for @xmath46 , in several different distributions we have tested .",
    "we find @xmath30 may have a weak energy dependence for @xmath47 ( below ) .",
    "although equation ( [ nonrelshock ] ) is quite accurate in the nonrelativistic regime , it breaks down when @xmath48 and the shock becomes trans - relativistic .",
    "even in the context of a planar , power - law density distribution , the dynamics are not self - similar in this stage .",
    "therefore , it has received little attention in previous work , whereas the opposite limit of self - similar , ultrarelativistic shock propagation was treated approximately by @xcite . however , a knowledge of the nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic shock velocity scalings does not suffice to specify the relative coefficient connecting the two stages",
    ". moreover , it does not allow one to describe ejecta that are only mildly relativistic ; as we shall show , these trans - relativistic ejecta contain more energy than the ultrarelativistic .",
    "for these reasons , we wish to investigate in detail the transition between newtonian and ultrarelativistic motion .    using an approximate treatment , @xcite presented the following estimate of the shock lorentz factor , @xmath49 , valid in the ultrarelativistic ( @xmath50 ) limit : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the energy density at some reference point in the flow .",
    "johnson & mckee obtained this result by assuming that initially a region of hot gas , with a spatially uniform value of @xmath53 , abutted cold gas with decreasing density @xmath54 . as a result ,",
    "the riemann invariant was the same on all forward characteristics emanating from the hot gas . in the case",
    "considered here there is no region with constant @xmath53 , so the exact values of @xmath55 and the numerical coefficient may be somewhat different .    noting the similarity between the newtonian and relativistic indices @xmath56 and @xmath57 that relate the shock velocity to the density profile , @xcite suggested the following formula for shocks bounding spherical blast waves : @xmath58 where @xmath59 for decelerating and @xmath60 for accelerating shocks .",
    "this approximation was found to be inferior to equation  ( [ nonrelshock ] ) in the nonrelativistic limit by @xcite , but it does suggest that the quantity @xmath61 can be approximated analytically .    however , equation ( [ gnatyk ] ) does not specify the normalization of the shock velocity .",
    "we therefore consider instead the following formula : @xmath62 in the newtonian limit this formula reduces to a shock velocity approximation very similar to equation ( [ nonrelshock ] ) , and it makes a transition to relativistic motion in the manner suggested by @xcite , ( equation [ [ gnatyk ] ] ) : hence the subscript gmm . since @xmath63 in the region of strong acceleration at the outside of a star , this formula has the same scaling as equation ( [ gnatyk ] ) there .",
    "whereas @xcite chose the shock - velocity coefficient numerically , equation ( [ gmm ] ) uses our earlier results and those of @xcite to prescribe it analytically .",
    "note that it is gnatyk s exponent @xmath64 , rather than @xmath65 , that enters this expression .",
    "insofar as equation ( [ nonrelshock ] ) accurately predicts the behavior of a nonrelativistic shock front with @xmath66 ( and we find that it does ) , equation ( [ gmm ] ) represents the result of an extrapolation to relativistic velocities using gnatyk s scaling .",
    "it remains to be determined whether the transition to relativistic motion is captured accurately by this formula .",
    "to study the dynamics of trans - relativistic blast waves , we have developed a relativistic , one - dimensional lagrangian hydrodynamics code based on an exact riemann solver @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian nature of our code is a key requirement for handling large ranges in density with fine zoning , of particular relevance for simulating shocks accelerating in stellar atmospheres .",
    "the code accurately handles standard test problems , including centrella s @xcite proposed wall shock and riemann shock tube tests .",
    "additionally the code recovers the ultrarelativistic blandford - mckee @xcite solution for spherical blast waves .    with this code",
    "we have conducted a suite of numerical calculations . for much of this study",
    "we employ a `` stellar '' model density distribution : an outer stellar envelope of polytropic index @xmath67 has the density profile @xmath68 in any region where the external mass @xmath69 can be ignored compared to @xmath70 and where @xmath67 does not vary .",
    "if this region extends inward to half the radius ( e.g. , for polytropes with @xmath71 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then the coefficient @xmath72 is equal to the density there : @xmath73 .",
    "for our stellar model , we join this outer profile to an inner , power - law density distribution : @xmath74 we choose a core radius @xmath75 , polytropic index @xmath76 , and power law index @xmath77 to resemble the progenitor model for sn  1998bw considered in   [ s:98bw ] . in order to find analytical formulae valid for various density distributions ,",
    "we have additionally considered an `` external power law envelope '' model , @xmath78 also with @xmath79 , where @xmath80 equation ( [ extpow ] ) is the @xmath81 limit of the polytropic profile ( [ eq : outerpolytrope ] ) , but significantly underestimates @xmath82 in the interior ( e.g. , by a factor of @xmath83 at @xmath84 ) .",
    "after an injection of thermal energy in the central few zones , a shock develops and propagates outwards , decelerating in the inner region , where the density gradient is shallow , and accelerating in the outer layers , where the density gradient is steep .",
    "we have investigated explosions with @xmath85 ranging from @xmath86 to @xmath87 . in each case , the resolution was increased either until the numerical results converged , or until a correction for incomplete convergence could be ascertained .    empirically , we find that the scaling proposed by @xcite , as realized in equation ( [ gmm ] ) , is roughly correct but not sufficiently accurate for a study of the energetics of relativistic ejecta . in order to capture the change in the value of the exponent from @xmath57 to @xmath88 , we adopt instead the following generalization of equation ( [ gmm ] ) : @xmath89 for the density distributions described above , our numerical results give @xmath90 , in agreement with the nonrelativistic self - similar theory and equation ( [ nonrelshock ] ) .",
    "we adopt this numerical value in our subsequent formulae .",
    "@xmath91 enters in many of our expressions and we set this equal to 5.35 . in the ultrarelativistic regime ( @xmath92 ) , equation ( [ relshockf ] ) was chosen to reproduce the approximate result @xmath93 obtained by @xcite .    in figures [ fig : propagation ] and [ fig : propagation2 ]",
    "we compare equations ( [ gmm ] ) and ( [ relshock ] ) to the results of our model simulations of explosions in the `` external power law '' and `` stellar '' density distributions .",
    "the two shock velocity formulae under consideration are extremely similar , differing by only very small powers of their parameters in both the non- and ultrarelativistic limits .",
    "their differences are most clearly seen in the stellar model , where density , and hence shock velocity , spans a greater range .",
    "limited numerical resolution does not allow us to follow the acceleration of a nonrelativistic shock into the ultrarelativistic regime .",
    "instead we have increased the explosion energy to investigate acceleration in different velocity regimes .",
    "our results show that our improved shock propagation model ( eq . [ [ relshockf ] ] ) is accurate to within @xmath94 for all energies and density distributions tested . ,",
    "to increase slightly with @xmath85 for energetic explosions , e.g. , for the external power law envelope model , the low energy ( @xmath95 ) explosions have @xmath96 as predicted from eq .",
    "( [ krhojl ] ) , while for @xmath97 , @xmath98 . ]",
    "furthermore we find the simple gnatyk scaling under predicts the acceleration of relativistic shocks and over - predicts the acceleration of nonrelativistic shocks .",
    "our highest energy explosion of the stellar model shows that the gnatyk scaling underestimates , by @xmath99 , the value of @xmath100 reached by a shock that accelerates from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "the final lorentz factor , @xmath103 , achieved by shocked ejecta depends sensitively on @xmath100 ( see  [ shacc ] ) .",
    "for example , postshock acceleration amplifies the above decrement into a factor of three error in @xmath103 .",
    "we must note that our approximation ( eqs .",
    "[ [ relshockf ] ] & [ [ relshock ] ] ) gives @xmath104 rather than the correct scaling @xmath105 that obtains in spherical , ultrarelativistic blast waves @xcite .",
    "because of this , the accuracy of our formula breaks down for blast waves that start out ultrarelativistically ; i.e. with @xmath106 . we begin to see these deviations by the time @xmath107 , as the value of @xmath30 tends to increase slightly ( @xmath108 ) , for a given density distribution .",
    "equations ( [ relshockf ] ) and ( [ relshock ] ) are strictly valid only for trans - relativistic blast waves , i.e. for shocks that are non- or semi - relativistic to begin with , but that may accelerate to high @xmath100 , i.e. @xmath109 .",
    "this is well satisfied for most of the astrophysical contexts to which we shall apply the formula in ",
    "[ s : applications ] , e.g. , our model for supernova 1998bw has @xmath110 .",
    "however , the extreme hypernova models considered in  [ s : c - grbs ] are at the limits of this approximation s validity , with @xmath111 .",
    "after the entire stellar envelope has been traversed by the shock wave , it is left in a state of outward motion . however",
    ", its heat content is comparable to its kinetic energy , so it will accelerate considerably as heat is converted into motion . assuming a strict conservation of lab - frame energy in each mass element  from the postshock state to a state of free expansion  allows one to roughly estimate the magnitude of this acceleration .",
    "however , this is a significant underestimate of the acceleration since the outermost layers gain energy at the expense of the slower ejecta within them , because of a steeply declining pressure gradient .",
    "the relativistic strong shock jump conditions give @xcite @xmath112 ^ 2}{{\\hat{\\gamma}}(2-{\\hat{\\gamma}})(\\gamma_2 -1 ) + 2},\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath113 refers to the fluid immediately behind the shock .",
    "for @xmath114 , we have @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the non- and ultrarelativistic limits , respectively .    now consider the postshock acceleration of material that was struck by a nonrelativistic , strong shock as it approached the periphery of the progenitor star .",
    "thermal and kinetic energies are in perfect equipartition behind the shock .",
    "therefore , strict energy conservation in each element implies @xmath117 and so @xmath118 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the results of self - similar shock acceleration and postshock acceleration , which for @xmath18 yield @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , the energy per baryon increases by factors of @xmath123 and @xmath124 in these two cases due to the concentration of energy in the fastest ejecta .",
    "this phenomenon is even more dramatic in the context of relativistic acceleration , where the postshock energy density is dominated by internal energy rather than the rest mass of the fluid . for a strong relativistic shock ,",
    "the total postshock energy per unit rest mass , evaluated in the fixed frame and neglecting terms of order @xmath125 , is @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "if each baryon maintained exactly this share of energy into the final state of cold , free expansion , then @xmath127 would also equal its terminal lorentz factor @xmath103 .",
    "the theory of acceleration behind an ultrarelativistic shock was treated approximately by @xcite , who estimated @xmath128 as a lower limit .",
    "would increase by a multiplicative constant if the rest mass of the fluid were included in the equation of state . ] in this case , postshock acceleration increases the energy per particle by a factor of approximately @xmath129 . as this is a large factor , the postshock acceleration , and the concentration of energy in the fastest material ,",
    "are even more impressive in the relativistic case .",
    "these considerations demonstrate that the acceleration of the fluid after it is shocked is critical to the distribution of energy with lorentz factor in the ejecta .",
    "the character of planar postshock acceleration is qualitatively different in the nonrelativistic case , where the velocity increases by a fixed factor , from the relativistic case , where the final lorentz factor becomes a power of the postshock value .",
    "however , in both cases there is a functional relationship between @xmath130 and @xmath131 . in reality",
    "there is a dependence on the slope of the density distribution as well , but this is quite weak and we are justified in ignoring it .",
    "hence our goal is to find an approximate analytical relationship between the final velocity of a fluid element and the velocity of the shock that struck it : one that obeys the known limits and remains sufficiently accurate in the trans - relativistic regime .",
    "we shall begin by examining postshock acceleration in strictly planar geometry",
    ". then we shall consider how spherical expansion may reduce the terminal lorentz factor of the ejecta relative to the planar case .",
    "we continue with the density distribution @xmath132 , with @xmath79 , which now describes a planar slab of material of length @xmath133 .",
    "we release shocks of varying strengths that propagate down this density ramp . in regions significantly far away from the launching region ( @xmath134 ) , and except for the effects of finite resolution , the shock and postshock behavior ought to be the same among all of these runs  i.e. , the function @xmath135 should have the same form .",
    "this follows from the fact that a power law density distribution introduces no scales of its own . by exploring the relation between shock and postshock velocities in simulations of different initial shock strength , we are able to discriminate this common behavior from the artifacts of the particular initial conditions or of the finite numerical resolution",
    ": see figure [ fig : planar ] .    for the purposes of numerical stability",
    ", we allow the fluid to expand into a uniform medium of sufficiently low density that its effects on the accelerating ejecta ( a reverse shock ) can be visualized and excluded from consideration .",
    "because the conversion of internal into kinetic energy is quite slow in planar expansion , and because of time - step constraints on our code , it was necessary to examine the approach of mass elements toward their terminal velocities in order to estimate how much acceleration would occur if they were allowed to expand indefinitely . a correction to @xmath136 based on the extrapolation of internal energy to",
    "zero was made .",
    "typical values of this correction were @xmath137 for the lower energy runs ( _ solid _ lines in figure [ fig : planar ] ) .",
    "for the most relativistic cases considered ( _ dotted _ lines ) the correction was @xmath138 .",

    "let us examine the criterion for relativistic ejecta to exist .",
    "the alternative is that the shock diffuses through the surface before @xmath189 reaches 0.49 , the value for which @xmath261 . the optical depth of a nonrelativistic shock front is @xmath262 @xcite , whereas the optical depth of the layer with mass @xmath201 is @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is the opacity . to contain the shock front when @xmath249 , @xmath265 , or @xmath266 this constraint on @xmath133 , which is easily satisfied by the model co6 considered below ( @xmath267 erg ; @xmath268 ) , becomes less restrictive as @xmath201 increases .",

    "the outer envelope becomes significantly more dilute compared to the core ; as we argued in the previous section , the efficiency of relativistic ejection , @xmath277 , increases correspondingly .",

    "although our results so far have been limited to spherical or planar symmetry , this scaling suggests that asymmetries in the initial explosion may be exaggerated in the angular distribution of relativistic ejecta .",

    "we arrive at this conclusion by examining the self - similar solution presented by @xcite for the planar version of this problem .",
    "equation ( a2 ) of their appendix allows us to calculate the trajectory of a mass shell from the time it is hit by the shock until the final state of free expansion .",
    "given this solution , their equation ( a1 ) gives the history of the shell s density , and hence , for adiabatic flow , its sound speed @xmath297 .",
    "the integral of @xmath298 gives the distance that a sound wave will travel along this mass shell during the entire period of postshock acceleration ; we find @xmath299 and @xmath300 for @xmath79 and @xmath301 , respectively , where @xmath302 is the time at which the shock was at the shell s initial depth @xmath164 .",
    "this indicates that the flow will remain planar as long as variations in the position and strength of the shock front occur on length scales large compared to the current depth , so that significantly different patches of the surface are out of acoustical contact .",
    "this becomes even more true if the shock is relativistic , for then the lateral region of influence is reduced in extent by a factor of about @xmath100 by time dilation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "likewise , the onset of spherical expansion causes @xmath297 to drop faster than the planar solution would predict , further restricting the lateral acoustic range . in each direction",
    "this flatness criterion must be satisfied at some point as the shock approaches the stellar surface ; after that , the motion is essentially planar . in reality , there are likely to be variations in the effective value of the spherical expansion factor @xmath163 , if lateral expansion sets in on the correlation scale of the flow rather than on the radial scale length @xmath133 ; this would have the effect of changing the appropriate value of @xmath303 . however , equation ( [ fsph ] ) shows that this variation can be ignored within the accuracy of our theory .    secondly , what is the angular distribution of ejecta from an aspherical explosion ? sufficiently close to the outside of the star that the above criterion is satisfied , each region of the surface evolves independently of other regions separated by more than a few times the initial depth . only one parameter controls the evolution of each region : the initial shock velocity .",
    "suppose that a numerical simulation has produced a shock whose intensity is @xmath235 ( according to equation [ [ relshock ] ] ) below a region with @xmath304 . equation ( [ eq : ekmexp ] ) can be applied to this patch of the surface , provided we replace the spherical variables @xmath230 and @xmath305 with their differentials : @xmath306 this emission is in the normal direction .",
    "note that here , as in ( [ eq : ekmexp ] ) , @xmath235 is a reference value of @xmath189 and is not related to @xmath160 by equation ( [ finalvelocityintermsofp ] ) . to gain insight into the implications of equation ( [ eq : asphyp ] ) for a given explosion ,",
    "we make recourse to the so - called _",
    "sector approximation_. here , non - radial motions are ignored and each angular sector is assumed to expand as if it were part of a spherical point explosion with the local distributions of mass ( @xmath307 ) and energy ( @xmath308 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : asphyp ] ) , which can be re - expressed in terms of @xmath309 instead of @xmath310 , then states that the energy per unit solid angle above some velocity scales as @xmath311 . in the simplest case , the energy and mass are those in a sector of a spherical explosion ; in this case , the energy per unit area ( or per unit solid angle ) above some reference velocity is unchanged . in the opposite case",
    "in which all the energy is confined within some small opening angle @xmath312 , the ejecta energy above some reference velocity is increased by a factor @xmath313 .",
    "this result gives a qualitative indication that aspherical explosions may appear far more intense ( for the fortunate viewer ) than spherical ones .",
    "moreover , this effect is enhanced in an aspherical explosion in which the energy injection is concentrated in directions in which @xmath307 is lower than average .",
    "lastly , it should be noted that @xcite and @xcite have identified an instability of nonrelativistic , accelerating shock fronts , in which the amplitude of the perturbation doubles every four density scale heights ; it saturates in a state where density is perturbed by a factor @xmath314 and pressure by a factor @xmath315 , and oblique weak shocks follow the leading shock .",
    "these results were obtained for an exponential density profile . however",
    ", a shock in a power - law density stratification can be expected to behave similarly , except that the relevant perturbation wavelength ( about two density scale heights ) will shrink in proportion to the distance to the surface , leaving behind a spectrum of artifacts in the postshock flow . to estimate whether the instability will saturate in a given star , note that the amplitude varies as @xmath316 according to @xcite , and therefore as @xmath317 .",
    "because the shock s velocity is typically @xmath318 when it begins to accelerate @xcite , the density perturbation will be enhanced by a factor @xmath319 before the shock becomes relativistic ( i.e. , before @xmath320 ) . for the model of sn 1998bw described below , for which @xmath110 , this corresponds to an amplification of one order of magnitude .",
    "thus far , we have considered only explosions caused by the collapse of a stellar core to a much denser state ; this has allowed us to neglect the binding energy of the ejected envelope , and to use equations ( e.g. , eq . [ [ relshock ] ] ) that assume a strong point explosion . in this section",
    "we address the opposite limit : mass ejection by a shock whose total energy is small compared to the binding energy of the stellar envelope .",
    "this will allow us to analyze analytically the ejecta from collapsing compact objects .    in this limit ,",
    "the shock is weak as it crosses most of the envelope , because the thermal energy of a hydrostatic envelope is comparable to its binding energy . near the surface of the star , however , the temperature is proportional to the depth .",
    "a shock is strong if it is capable of ejecting material ( @xmath321 , the escape velocity ) , as the sound speed is @xmath322 .",

    "so long as this occurs where @xmath324 .",
    "although we can not use equation ( [ relshock ] ) to predict the shock velocity from the parameters of the explosion , we can nevertheless apply our formulae for shock and postshock acceleration , and use @xmath323 to set the energy scale of what emerges .",
    "we assume that the material of interest undergoes all of its acceleration in the vicinity of the stellar surface ; then , the ejecta undergo a brief phase of acceleration followed by ballistic motion , in which they either escape ( @xmath325 ) or fall back . as relativistic stars are unstable , @xmath326(env)@xmath327 , so the explosions under consideration are necessarily nonrelativistic ; likewise , any relativistic ejecta must escape , as @xmath323 can only be a fraction of @xmath328 .",

    "following @xcite , we simulate the explosion of co6 by subtracting a remnant mass of @xmath433 from the center and depositing @xmath434 ergs in several pressurized , stationary zones ; ignoring the effects of gravity , we follow the subsequent behavior until the final state of free expansion ( for the relativistic ejecta , @xmath435 suffices ) .",

    "any viable model for the central engines of gamma - ray bursts , especially for those bursts known to be at cosmological distances , must explain the existence of large energies ( @xmath661 erg , if isotropic ) in ejecta moving sufficiently fast that , when converted into radiation , it escapes as non - thermal radiation .",
    "such velocities require very little `` baryon loading , '' a constraint that many theories for gamma - ray burst central engines address . in this paper",
    ", we have investigated the possibility that shock hydrodynamical acceleration , first proposed as a source of grbs by @xcite , may concentrate sufficient energy in the fastest ejecta to satisfy this constraint .",
    "we consider ordinary and over - energetic supernova explosions , making specific models for the hypothesized class of supernova gamma - ray bursts ( s - grbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whose existence was suggested by sn 1998bw and grb 980425 .",
    "we also calculate the yield of relativistic ejecta from hypothetical models for extraordinary `` hypernova '' explosions , as well as possible accretion - induced collapses of white dwarfs and sudden condensations of neutron stars .    as an exemplary case , we have considered in detail (  [ s:98bw ] ) specific models for supernova 1998bw and the gamma - ray burst ( grb 980425 ) that it may have produced , considering the constraints of the grb and the supernova s early radio emission in the context of progenitor models constructed ( by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to fit its light curve .",
    "one goal of this investigation has been to evaluate assertions @xcite that spherical models for this explosion can not explain the grb .",
    "after properly accounting for the the trans - relativistic shock and postshock dynamics as well as the interaction with a surrounding stellar wind , we are able to account for all of the observations of this event with a spherical energetic type ic supernova from a progenitor with high ( @xmath662 ) mass loss rate , consistent with observed carbon - rich ( wc ) wolf - rayet stars .",
    "our conclusion that the fastest ejecta need not be asymmetric is reminiscent of the fact that the radio shell around sn 1993j was spherical @xcite despite the assertion @xcite that its polarization implied an asymmetrical explosion .",
    "our model for sn 1998bw and grb 980425 invokes a circumstellar environment similar to that inferred around sn 1997cy , which may be associated with grb 970514 @xcite ; however the two - second duration of this burst may be difficult to reconcile with the external shock hypothesis .    in order to quantify the process of relativistic mass ejection",
    ", we have extended the nonrelativistic theory of supernova explosions @xcite into the relativistic regime .",
    "finding that the energetics of such ejecta depend sensitively on the velocity of the shock front as it emerges from the stellar surface , we present in  [ s : shockprop ] a formula for this velocity ( eqs .",
    "[ [ relshockf ] ] and [ [ relshock ] ] ) that handles the transition from nonrelativistic to relativistic flow more accurately than does the prediction of @xcite ( equation [ gnatyk ] ) .",
    "whereas for @xcite it sufficed to take a universal value for the normalization of the shock velocity ( and also applied an overall energy conservation constraint to their ejecta - density models ) , we have found it necessary to present ( eqs . [",
    "[ anr ] ] , [ [ sigma ] ] , and [ [ krhojl ] ] ) a refined estimate for this coefficient  one that responds to the initial density distribution of the progenitor .",
    "the motivation for such precision is the sensitive dependence of the final velocity of a mass element on the velocity of the shock that struck it : in the relativistic , planar limit this is @xmath663 .",
    "this postshock acceleration , neglected in many works that invoke shock acceleration , is crucial for the production of appreciable energy in fast ejecta . in  [ shacc ] we present formulae for this postshock acceleration in the planar limit ( eq . [ [ planar ] ] ) and for the effect of spherical geometry to reduce the acceleration ( eqs .",
    "[ [ fsphdef ] ] and [ [ fsph ] ] ) .",
    "the latter is somewhat uncertain , due to the limitations of our numerical calculations ; however , since this correction is a factor of order unity , the energetics of relativistic ejecta are not especially sensitive to it . because we account properly for postshock acceleration , our predictions for the energetics of relativistic ejecta are much larger than presented in previous works that considered hydrodynamical shock acceleration in the context of supernovae , accretion - induced collapses of white dwarfs , and phase transitions in neutron stars .    with the dynamics of trans - relativistic mass ejection",
    "well in hand , we turned in ",
    "[ s : kedist ] to an evaluation of the amount of kinetic energy expected in ejecta traveling above some given lower limit . equation ( [ ekgeneral ] ) represents an accurate approximation for this kinetic energy distribution under the assumption that the outer stellar density distribution is that of a polytropic atmosphere of index @xmath67 .",
    "this formula shows that the kinetic energy distribution rolls over quite slowly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kean ] ) from @xmath664 , to @xmath665 , as the final velocity in question goes from nonrelativistic ( @xmath666 ) to relativistic ( @xmath667 ) ; this slow limiting behavior comes from fact that relativistic final velocities originate from only mildly relativistic shocks . for typical values of @xmath67 , the kinetic energy in",
    "relativistic ejecta decreases as @xmath668 ; this gentle decline with velocity allows for significant energy at relatively high @xmath103 .",
    "we next developed (  [ s : whips ] ) a theory to assess what characteristics of a stellar envelope make it especially efficient at converting a given dose of injected energy into relativistic motion  the astrophysical analog of how to design a good bullwhip .",
    "if the envelope mass is fixed , we found that more centrally - condensed envelopes are more efficient producers of high - velocity ejecta .",
    "if instead the progenitor star is given , then the energy in fast ejecta is enhanced by allowing as much of it as possible to collapse ( minimizing @xmath22 ) , as this increases the energy per mass of what escapes .",
    "evaluating the energetics of relativistic ejecta for radiative stellar progenitors in  [ s : whips ] , we derived expressions appropriate for regions dominated by electron scattering ( eq . [ [ erelthomson ] ] ) or bound - free or free - free ( eq . [ [ erelkramers ] ] ) absorption , assuming different possible compositions for the outer envelope . for the thomson opacity case , the central concentration of the atmosphere  and therefore its efficacy at producing relativistic ejecta  is enhanced if the stellar luminosity approaches the eddington limit .    it should be kept in mind that typical supernovae in supergiant stars are not capable of creating any relativistic ejecta @xcite , because there , shock acceleration ends at nonrelativistic velocities at a depth that matches the width of the shock . in this paper , we have only considered progenitors sufficiently compact and exploding with enough energy , that relativistic ejection does occur .",
    "although we do not model asymmetrical explosions , our theory for shock and postshock dynamics can be applied to simulations of such an event . in  [ s : aspherical ] we present a formula ( eq . [ [ eq : asphyp ] ] ) for the relativistic yield of each patch of the stellar surface , in terms of the intensity of the ( nonrelativistic ) shock as it might be observed in such a simulation . as multidimensional simulations",
    "can not yet afford to treat relativistic dynamics with the extremely fine zoning that would be required to match the predictive power of this formula , it could be quite useful in future investigations .",
    "in  [ s : wd / ns - theory ] we have put our dynamical formulae to another use : the prediction of what will be ejected in the case of an explosion so weak that it only ejects a small mass from the outside of the star . assuming ballistic motion after a brief phase of acceleration , the escape velocity marks the inner boundary of the ejecta . for this reason , the overall kinetic energy ( eq . [ [ gravesc ] ] ) and the kinetic energy above some given velocity ( eqs . [",
    "[ ek - wd / ns ] ] , [ [ ek - wd - a ] ] , and [ [ ek - ns - b ] ] ) are proportional the initial binding energy of the ejecta",
    ". applied to neutron star phase transitions in ",
    "[ s : nss ] , equation ( [ gravesc ] ) predicts within @xmath186 the average kinetic energy per gram in the ejecta in @xcite s simulations .",
    "these considerations also provide some insight into the characteristic shock velocity at the base of the ejecta (  [ s : characteristicvelocities ] ) .    after calculating in  [ ss:98bw ] the energy distribution of relativistic ejecta from @xcite s model co6 for sn  1998bw , and demonstrating that this can explain both the observed gamma - ray burst ( @xmath656 s timescale ;  [ s : gammarays ] ) and the rapidly expanding radio shell ( @xmath532 day timescale ;  [ s : radio ] ) , we turned to the modeling of far more energetic `` hypernova '' explosions in ",
    "[ s : c - grbs ] .",
    "the association of grb afterglows with the stellar population of their host galaxies @xcite , and more tentatively with star forming regions @xcite , argues in favor of a connection with the deaths of massive stars and against scenarios involving neutron star mergers .",
    "furthermore , the difficulty of avoiding baryon loading while trying to escape the stellar progenitor , encountered even in highly asymmetric jet models @xcite , is overcome in the hydrodynamic shock acceleration mechanism .    in this model grbs , like their afterglows , would represent radiation from an external shock that accelerates the ambient medium , with an extra component ( of comparable luminosity ) from the reverse shock that decelerates the ejecta ; both shocks must decelerate monotonically .",
    "note that the higher efficiency of @xmath3-ray production in models including external shocks , compared to those based solely on internal shocks @xcite , gives external shock models less stringent total energy requirements .",
    "the spectral signature of such two - shock structures @xcite should be used to test this hypothesis ; however , the reverse shock is buried under more material ( by a factor of @xmath572 ) and may not be visible early on .",
    "while highly structured grb profiles are difficult to accommodate in this scenario @xcite , most of the grbs with afterglows have relatively smooth pulses .",
    "small amounts of substructure may result from interaction with an inhomogeneous medium @xcite , or from postshock velocity perturbations produced by instabilities in the accelerating shock @xcite or the presence of steep density shelves in the progenitor s atmosphere .",
    "more detailed modeling of these processes is required . in some bursts",
    ", there is evidence that a smooth and soft component of the grb flux is an early manifestation of the afterglow .",
    "the existence of this component agrees with the external - shock model , although the fact that it does not account for the entire grb does not .",
    "grb 990123 had an optical flash that has been interpreted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to arise from reverse - shock emission ; however , this model invoked a brief rather than a continuous collision of ejecta with the swept - up shell .",
    "because an external medium is necessary to liberate the energy , the lorentz factor of the emitting region must not only exceed the usual lower limit from photon - photon opacity ( eq . [ [ photonphoton ] ] ) , but also a limit due to the opacity of a circumstellar wind ( eq .  [ [ gammaopticallythin2 ] ] ) or the density of a uniform background ( eq . [ [ uniformconstraint ] ] ) .",
    "the observed gamma - ray energies thus become , in a spherical model for the burst , lower limits for the amount of energy in ejecta whose lorentz factor satisfies these constraints . as the bursts in question have quite smooth time profiles , and because our adoption of the external - shock hypothesis dictates that the age of a burst , rather than the timescale of its substructure , be used to constrain the lorentz factor , we predict smaller minimum lorentz factors than commonly quoted in the literature , by factors of ten or more .",
    "this eases the baryon - loading constraint by a similar amount .",
    "we find that a simple , and admittedly extreme , spherical hypernova model satisfies the energy and velocity constraints of many of the observed cosmological grbs .",
    "the most energetic bursts , such as grb 990123 , require asymmetric explosions .",
    "these need not be highly aspherical as the results of  [ s : aspherical ] show that a mild ( factor of two ) variation in shock intensity at a given column below the surface of the star can lead to an extreme ( factor of 100 ) variation in the observed burst intensity .",
    "if such variations are justified by simulations , this result may allow even the most energetic bursts to be explained by hydrodynamical shock acceleration in aspherical hypernovae .",
    "since the very luminous bursts do not differ from typical ones in any significant manner other than luminosity , it is likely that all cosmological bursts are aspherical , and as a result there is no need to invoke hypernova models as extreme as the one we have considered .",
    "since we predict a kinetic energy that decreases with lorentz factor roughly as @xmath669 , there must be more energy in slower relativistic ejecta , and ( if @xmath670 ) much more in nonrelativistic ejecta as well .",
    "as the shocked region decelerates , an increasing fraction of this energy should appear in the afterglow ; therefore , estimates of afterglow energetics ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) may potentially rule out such models in the future .",
    "however , having demonstrated in equation ( [ eshellwindshock ] ) that the energy of the shocked shell increases quite slowly , we find that @xcite s constraints can not yet rule out hypernovae as sources of cosmological grbs .",
    "energetic events in compact objects have also been considered as engines for grbs .",
    "white dwarfs (  [ s : wds ] ) explode as type ia supernovae , but the relativistic ejecta from sne ia are too weak to be of much interest .",
    "accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs can potentially concentrate a somewhat smaller energy ( @xmath620 erg ) in a smaller ( @xmath671 ) mass of ejecta . considering the simulations of @xcite",
    ", we predict a much greater yield of relativistic ejecta than their estimates ; but not enough to power cosmological grbs .",
    "neutron star phase transitions , considered in  [ s : nss ] , are well described by the weak explosion theory of  [ s : wd / ns - theory ] .",
    "as equation ( [ gravesc ] ) gives the overall energetics of the explosion to within @xmath186 , we are justified in using equation ( [ ek - wd / ns ] ) to predict the energetics of fast ejecta .",
    "our estimates , validated with numerical simulation , are several orders of magnitude higher than those of @xcite , who underestimated postshock acceleration .",
    "however , we note that such events do not put enough energy at sufficient lorentz factor to satisfy the observational constraints for distant bursts with afterglows",

    "<S> we investigate the acceleration of shock waves to relativistic velocities in the outer layers of exploding stars . by concentrating the energy of the explosion in the outermost ejecta </S>",
    "<S> , such trans - relativistic blast waves can serve as the progenitors of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ; in particular , the `` baryon - loading '' problem that plagues many models of grbs is circumvented . </S>",
    "<S> postshock acceleration is effective in boosting the kinetic energy in relativistic ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we present physically motivated analytic expressions to describe trans - relativistic blast waves in supernovae , and we validate these expressions against numerical simulations of test problems . investigating the effect of stellar structure on mass ejection , we find that relativistic ejecta are enhanced in more centrally condensed envelopes  </S>",
    "<S> e.g . </S>",
    "<S> , for radiative envelopes , when the luminosity approaches the eddington limit . </S>",
    "<S> convenient formulae are presented with which to estimate the production of relativistic ejecta from a given progenitor .    </S>",
    "<S> we apply our analytic and numerical methods to a model of sn 1998bw , finding significantly enhanced relativistic ejecta compared to previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that grb 980425 is associated with sn 1998bw and may have resulted from an approximately spherical explosion producing @xmath0 of mildly relativistic ejecta with mean lorentz factor @xmath1 , which then interacted with a dense circumstellar wind with mass loss rate @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a highly asymmetric explosion is not required . </S>",
    "<S> an extreme model of `` hypernova '' explosions in massive stars is able to account for the energetics and relativistic ejecta velocities required by many of the observed cosmological grbs . </S>",
    "<S> however , the most energetic bursts require asymmetric expulsion of ejecta , perhaps caused by rotationally flattened progenitors </S>",
    "<S> . we present simplified models and simulations of explosions resulting from accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs and phase transitions of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> while we find increased energies in relativistic ejecta compared to previous studies , these explosions are unlikely to be observed at cosmological distances with current detectors , unless extreme explosion energies and asymmetries are invoked . </S>"
