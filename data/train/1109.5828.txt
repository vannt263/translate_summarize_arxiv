    "magnetite ( fe@xmath0o@xmath1 ) is a 3d transition - metal oxide and an itinerant ferrimagnet with a high curie temperature ( 858 k ) and intriguing transport properties , including a metal insulator transition at t @xmath2 120 k ( the verwey transition ) and high spin polarized current attributed to its being half metallic .",
    "the latter property has given rise to a renewed interest in this material as a promising material system for spintronics applications @xcite and special efforts have been devoted to elucidate its magnetotransport properties .",
    "two of the most fundamental magnetotransport properties of itinerant ferromagnets are the dependence of the longitudinal ( @xmath3 ) and transverse resistivity ( @xmath4 ) on the relative orientation of the magnetization ( * m * ) and electric current ( * j * ) , known as anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) and planar hall effect ( phe ) , respectively .",
    "both phenomena are attributed to spin - orbit interaction which mixes spin - up and spin - down states @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , amr and phe are commonly expressed as @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the angle between * j * and * m * , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the longitudinal and transverse resistivities corresponding to * m * @xmath9 * j * and * m * @xmath10 * j * , respectively . while eqs .",

    "this has been demonstrated for [ 001]-oriented epitaxial manganites thin films @xcite , where a description of amr and phe is provided by taking into account the cubic symmetry of the system .",
    "the applicable equations are : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the angles between * m * and * j * relative to the [ 100 ] crystal direction , respectively ( see inset of fig . [",
    "fig : rvst ] ) .    in this work",
    "we focus our attention on the anisotropic magnetoresistance behaviour of epitaxial magnetite films , where the need for an additional term with fourfold symmetry has been suggested in the literature @xcite .",
    "we show , however , that eqs .",
    "[ eq : rho_par1 ] and [ eq : rho_par2 ] are required to fully describe the amr and phe of cubic epitaxial films for arbitrary directions of current and magnetization .",
    "we find different temperature and magnetic field dependence of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , suggesting that they originate from different scattering mechanisms .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is found to exhibit a strong magnetic field dependence , which is ascribed mainly to the effect of antiphase boundaries in the fe@xmath0o@xmath1  film .",
    "the full description of the amr and phe behavior of magnetite films allows new insight on the transport mechanisms in this compound and enables the optimization of the planar hall voltage response , which could be useful for non - volatile memory devices based on the planar hall effect @xcite .",
    "for this study , fe@xmath0o@xmath1  films @xmath17 nm thick were grown on mgo(001 ) single crystals by molecular beam epitaxy in an ultrahigh vacuum deposition system with a base pressure of @xmath18 mbar .",
    "prior to film growth the mgo substrate was cleaned under an oxygen plasma at 520 k for 30 - 60 min , which renders the surface well ordered and free of impurities , as determined by surface electron diffraction ( low energy electron diffraction , leed , and reflection high energy electron diffraction , rheed ) and x - ray spectroscopy ( auger electron spectroscopy , aes , and x - xay photoemission spectroscopy , xps ) , respectively . for the magnetite growth ,",
    "an atomic fe beam was thermally generated from an effusion cell under an o@xmath19 partial pressure of @xmath20 mbar , with the substrate temperature held at 520 k. film thickness was estimated from a calibrated thickness monitor , while film crystallinity was monitored during growth using rheed .",
    "after growth , the film was characterized _ in situ _ by rheed and xps , showing that the magnetite films are single crystalline and stoichiometric @xcite .",
    "the mgo substrate crystal orientation was confirmed by laue diffraction .",

    "the measurements were performed with a constant magnetic field of up to 9 t rotating in the plane of the film .",
    "this field is much larger than the reported in - plane magnetization saturating field @xcite ; hence , the magnetization is expected to be practically parallel to the applied field .",
    "two representative examples of the angular variation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : amr&phe ] for @xmath22 k. we find that while @xmath4 varies sinusoidally , its amplitude depends on @xmath13 and the location of the extremal points depend on @xmath12 , inconsistent with eq .",

    "the equations have three parameters and in the fitting process we use the same values for fitting the amr and phe curves for the six current directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : amr&phe ] ) .",
    "we note that eqs .",
    "[ eq : rho_par1 ] and [ eq : rho_par2 ] provide a good fit to the data even below the verwey temperature , where bulk magnetite is monoclinic .",
    "this is expected since our films are epitaxial and they maintain cubic symmetry in the plane of the magnetization and current .",
    "the temperature dependence of the three fitting parameters , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath23 , is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mrvst ] .",
    "we note that at high temperatures @xmath15 is dominant , while at low temperatures @xmath14 and @xmath23 dominate . the fact that the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 show distinct temperature dependencies indicate that they have different origins .",

    "[ eq : rhoxx_old ] and [ eq : rhoxy_old ] , and they are independent of crystal symmetry . on the other hand , the terms with the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath23 as their coefficients are sensitive to the crystal symmetry .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 appears only in the equation for @xmath3 and is responsible for a fourfold angular symmetry which provides a clear manifestation of crystal symmetry effects .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 contributes to both @xmath3 and @xmath4 with a twofold symmetry , and the crystal symmetry is manifested when amr and phe are measured for current directions away from the principal axes .",
    "this may explain why the crystal contribution to amr and phe at high temperatures has not been reported before @xcite .",
    "we note also that , according to eqs . 3 and 4 , the anisotropic magnetoresistance as usually defined , @xmath24 , yields @xmath25 , showing that for @xmath26 the amr can be positive or negative , depending of the direction of the electric current ( @xmath13 )",
    ". in particular , for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and the amr , as conventionally defined , changes sign at around 150 k.    the field dependence of the magnetoresistance fitting parameters was also measured at selected temperatures and representative results for one sample are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrvsh](a ) . while the field dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is weak , the parameter @xmath23 varies strongly with the magnetic field amplitude , with no sign of saturating up to 9 t. the field dependence yields quite dramatic changes in the amr as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrvsh](b ) , which exhibits a much stronger fourfold symmetry component when the field is increased from 2 t to 9 t. the field dependence of the magnetoresistance parameters varies with temperature , but the qualitative behavior is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrvsh](a ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 , which represents magnetoresistivity term insensitive to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , is also found to vary strongly with the magnetic field , giving rise to large magnetoresistances of the order of 10% at 9 t. while the magnetoresistance ratio of bulk magnetite is relatively weak , of the order of 0.1% @xcite , much larger effects , of up to 10% at 5 t @xcite , are observed in thin films .    several different factors may affect the magnetotransport behavior of magnetite , including the spin - orbit coupling , electron localization on approaching the verwey transition , changes in the spin polarization as a function of temperature @xcite , and changes in the character of the charge carrier at temperatures near room temperature @xcite .",
    "the combination of all these factors makes a correct identification of the dominant scattering processes in play challenging .",
    "we do note , however , that the difference between bulk compounds and thin films grown on mgo ( particulary , lack of high field saturation ) has been attributed to the presence of antiphase boundaries ( apb ) @xcite .",
    "the apb disturb the magnetic configuration even at high magnetic fields , particularly close to the boundary , as illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : cvsh](b ) ; hence , they are likely to be the origin of the magnetic field dependence of the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "we turn now to examine whether there could be a link between apb and the observed field dependance of amr .     and ( left axis ) the other parameters from eqs .",

    "[ eq : rho_par1].,title=\"fig : \" ]    we follow previous treatments and calculate the spin configuration , @xmath29 , in an infinite ferromagnetically - coupled spin chain with anti - ferromagnetic boundary at the origin .",
    "the energy per unit area of such a spin chain to the left to the origin is given by @xcite @xmath30dx \\label{eq : spin_energy1}\\ ] ] where the first term in the integral is the zeeman energy and the second term is the nearest neighbor exchange contribution .",
    "the angle between the magnetization , @xmath31 , and the magnetic field , @xmath32 , is denoted by @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the exchange stiffness constant .",
    "we neglect the magnetocrystalline , since it is much smaller than the external field that we used in our measurements @xcite .",
    "standard variational calculus procedures yield : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the angle between the spins on both sides of the boundary which depends on the anti - ferromagnetic coupling , and can be calculated based on the equilibrium condition of the chain @xcite .",
    "we note that this model does not take into account the distribution in the orientation of the apb , since @xmath29 does not depend on the angle between the apb and magnetic field .",

    "the averages are @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , where @xmath46 is the separation between spins ( about 1  @xcite ) and the domain size is @xmath2 350  @xcite . changing the domain size in a reasonable range between 250  and 350  does not affect the results significantly .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath47 and @xmath40 is much smaller than the field dependance of @xmath15 and @xmath23 .",
    "however , as suggested before @xcite , the largest contribution to resistivity is close to the boundary ( due to the significant change in the spin orientation ) and taking the average only in the vicinity of the boundary yields a more dramatic field dependance ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : cvsh ] ) .",
    "thus , one can not exclude that a more sophisticated model that would consider the effect of spin variation on @xmath48 would yield better agreement with experiment .    in summary , we measured the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the longitudinal and transverse resistivities of fe@xmath0o@xmath1  as a function of the current direction relative to the crystal axes .",
