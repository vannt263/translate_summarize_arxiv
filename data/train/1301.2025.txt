    "the ubiquitous heisenberg exchange is complemented by single - ion anisotropy .",
    "the interplay between these interactions with external magnetic field and lattice geometry can result in a rich variety of quantum phases and phenomena , including the haldane phase of quasi-1d systems @xcite , field induced bose einstein condensation ( bec ) of magnetic states @xcite and field induced ferronematic ordering @xcite .",
    "interest in @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnets with uniaxial exchange and single - ion anisotropies has gained additional impetus recently after it was shown to exhibit the spin analog of the elusive supersolid phase on a lattice over a finite range of magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite    in contrast to its classical counterpart ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath0 systems become _ quantum paramagnets _ ( qpm ) for sufficiently strong easy - plane single - ion anisotropy . in other words , they do not order down to zero temperature , @xmath9 , because the dominant anisotropy term , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , forces each spin to be predominantly in the non - magnetic @xmath12 state : @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "the application of a magnetic field , @xmath15 , along the @xmath16-axis reduces the spin gap linearly in @xmath15 since the field couples to a conserved quantity ( total magnetization along the @xmath16-axis ) .",
    "the gap is closed at a quantum critical point ( qcp ) where the bottom of the @xmath17 branch of magnetic excitations touches zero .",
    "this qcp belongs to the bec universality class and the gapless mode of low - energy @xmath17 excitations remains quadratic for small momenta , @xmath18 , because the zeeman term commutes with the rest of the hamiltonian . since the dynamical exponent is @xmath19 , the effective dimension is @xmath20 and the upper critical dimension is @xmath21 .",
    "this , and analogous field - driven transitions , have been widely studied experimentally to demonstrate bec related phenomena in many quantum magnets .",
    "@xcite one of these magnets is the metal - organic framework dtn that we mentioned above @xcite .",
    "the starting point of any theoretical study of a magnetic field induced phase transition in a qpm is to determine the hamiltonian parameters , i.e. , the exchange constants and the amplitude of the different anisotropies .",
    "the simplest way of extracting these parameters is to fit the branches of magnetic excitations that are measured with inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) .",
    "the reliability of this procedure is normally limited by the accuracy of the approach that is used to compute the dispersion relation of magnetic excitations .",
    "numerical methods like quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) are very accurate , but they can only be applied under special circumstances . while the dmrg method @xcite has evolved to the extent that dynamical properties such as the frequency and momentum dependence of the magnetic structure factor can be computed very accurately @xcite , its application is restricted to quasi - one - dimensional magnets such as hpip - cubr@xmath5 @xcite . on the other hand , qmc methods can only be applied to systems that have no frustration in the exchange interaction , i.e. , that are free of the infamous sign problem .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to find simple analytical approaches that are accurate enough to quantitatively reproduce the quantum phase diagram and the dispersion of magnetic excitations .",
    "one of the purposes of this work is to test different analytical approaches against the results of accurate qmc simulations of a spin - one heisenberg hamiltonian with easy - plane single - ion anisotropy .",
    "the model is defined either on a square or on a cubic lattice to avoid frustration and make the qmc method applicable .",
    "besides being relevant for describing real quantum magnets , such as dtn , this model provides one of the simplest realizations of quantum paramagnetism and is ideal for testing methods that can be naturally extended to more complex systems .    the generic @xmath0 heisenberg model with uniaxial single",
    " ion anisotropy on an isotropic hyper - cubic lattice is given by the hamiltonian : @xmath22 where the sum in the first term runs over nearest neighbor pairs @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the strength of the single ion - anisotropy , @xmath25 is the exchange constant and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the g - factor and @xmath28 is the bohr magneton .",
    "henceforth , @xmath25 is set to unity and all the parameters are expressed in units of @xmath25 . in this work",
    ", we shall only consider models with spatially isotropic interactions , although the formalism can be straightforwardly generalized to anisotropic lattices .",
    "the @xmath29 quantum phase diagram of @xmath30 is well known from mean field analysis @xcite , series expansion studies@xcite and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 term splits the local spin states into @xmath31 and @xmath32 doublet . as we explained above",
    ", the ground state is a quantum paramagnet for large @xmath33 , i.e. , it has no long range magnetic order and there is a finite energy gap to spin excitations . at finite magnetic fields ,",
    "the zeeman term lowers the energy of the @xmath34 state until the gap closes at a critical field @xmath35 . a canted antiferromagnetic ( cafm ) phase appears right above @xmath35 : the spins acquire a uniform longitudinal component and an antiferromagnetically ordered transverse component that spontaneously breaks the u(1 ) symmetry of global spin rotations along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "the cafm phase can also be described as a condensation of bosonic particles .",
    "the particle density , @xmath36 , is related to the local magnetization along the symmetry axis @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field acts as a chemical potential in the bosonic description . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the system is populated by a finite density of bosons that condense in the single particle state with momentum @xmath39 with @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the longitudinal magnetization ( density of bosons ) increases with field and saturates at the fully polarized ( fp ) state ( @xmath42 ) above the saturation field @xmath43 .",
    "the fp state corresponds to a bosonic mott insulator in the language of bose gases .",
    "there exists a critical value of the single - ion anisotropy , @xmath44 , below which the cafm phase extends down to zero field .",
    "the nature of the qpm - cafm quantum phase transition changes between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the transition belongs to the bec universality class for @xmath46 , while it belongs to the o(2 ) universality class for @xmath47 .    in the next section",
    "we introduce a generalized spin wave theory that describes the ground state and quasiparticle excitations of the quantum paramagnetic and the canted afm phases .",
    "we describe two procedures ",
    "one based on the standard holstein - primakoff approach @xcite , and a second one in which a lagrange multiplier is introduced to enforce the local constraint at a mean field level @xcite .",
    "the qmc method is introduced in sec .",
    "[ ztr ] includes a comparison between the analytical and numerical ( qmc ) results , which shows that the quantitative agreement with numerical simulations is considerably improved for the lagrange multiplier method over the holstein - primakoff approach .",
    "we note that this is true both for the quantum phase diagram and for the dispersion of magnetic excitations even in @xmath1 .",
    "this remarkable accuracy in describing low energy dispersion indicates that the second approach is ideally suited for extracting hamiltonian parameters from fits of ins data .",
    "[ ftr ] is devoted to finite temperature results . finally , in sec .  [ sum ]",
    "we discuss the implication of our results for the organic quantum magnet dtn and for any other quantum magnet that is close to the qcp which separates the magnetically ordered and paramagnetic ground states .",
    "in this section , we give a brief outline of the generalized spin wave formalism that was originally applied to the description of the quantum paramagnetic state of dtn @xcite .",
    "since the local hilbert space has dimension @xmath48 , we introduce three schwinger bosons ( sb ) with annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath49 .",
    "the three different states occupied by a single boson are mapped into the eigenstates of @xmath50 for each site @xmath51 : @xmath52 the local constraint , @xmath53 guarantees that the dimension of the local hilbert space is preserved under this mapping .",
    "the bilinear forms of these sbs are generators of su(3 ) in the fundamental representation @xcite .",
    "we use the sbs to extend the usual su(2 ) spin wave approach to su(3 ) @xcite since the local order parameter for @xmath0 spins has 8 components , which correspond to the 8 generators of the su(3 ) group of unitary transformations in the local hilbert space of dimension 3 .",
    "three of them correspond to the local magnetization @xmath54 , while the other five are the components of the traceless symmetric tensor , @xmath55 , that defines the local spin nematic moment .",
    "in particular , the paramagnetic mean field ground state has a net nematic component induced by the single - ion anisotropy , but no net magnetization component .",
    "such a state has no classical counterpart .",
    "nevertheless , we can still implement a semi - classical approximation if we generalize the traditional spin - wave analysis from su(2 ) to su(3 ) . in this approach",
    ", we can describe the quantum fluctuations around the mean field state as small ( quadratic ) oscillations of an su(3 ) order parameter .    at the mean field level , any ground state that is stabilized for @xmath56",
    "is described by the product state @xmath57 where @xmath58 and the variational parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are determined by minimization of the mean field energy per site @xmath61 : @xmath62 we note that the variational parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are enough to parametrize the three different phases that appear in the phase diagram of @xmath63 for @xmath11 .",
    "the bosonic operator @xmath64 belongs to a new set of sb operators that are obtained from the original set @xmath65 by a unitary transformation , @xmath66 : @xmath67 this transformation corresponds to choosing a quantization axis along the direction of the order parameter , as it is done in the usual spin wave treatment .",
    "since the ground state of the antiferromagnetic phase breaks translational symmetry making the two sublattices inequivalent , the corresponding canonical transformation , @xmath66 , is different for the two sublattices , as it is clear from the phase factor @xmath68 that appears in eq ..    in terms of the sbs , the spin operators @xmath69 assume bilinear forms @xmath70 , @xmath71 that transform as @xmath72 .",
    "the spatial dependence of the unitary transformation @xmath66 can be eliminated if we change the original basis of the hamiltonian @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , the cafm state becomes uniform if we rotate the spin reference frame of one of the sublattices by angle @xmath74 along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "since the uniform paramagnetic ground states of @xmath73 remain invariant under this transformation , the unitary transformations @xmath66 become @xmath51-independent in the new basis for all the different phases of @xmath73 . since ,",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 , we have that @xmath77 @xmath78 in the new basis , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we note that this change of basis shifts the afm wave vector from @xmath39 to @xmath81 and removes the factor @xmath68 from eq .  .",
    "the bosonic representation of the hamiltonian in the new basis is @xmath82 where @xmath83    the condensation of the bosons @xmath84 is implemented via a natural extension of the holstein - primakoff transformation  @xcite to the case of more than one type of boson . from the local constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) we obtain : @xmath85 by applying the above condition to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) and keeping terms up to bilinear in the bosonic creation and annihilation operators , we obtain the mean field ground state energy @xmath86 and the spin wave hamiltonian @xmath87   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\hspace*{-0.4 cm } \\sum_{\\begin{subarray}{c}{\\bm r}\\\\\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\{1,2\\}\\end{subarray } } \\hspace*{-0.4 cm } \\lambda_{\\alpha\\beta}{\\tilde b}^\\dagger_{\\alpha { \\bm r } } { \\tilde b}_{\\beta { \\bm r } } \\label{eq : hsw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the hamiltonian parameters @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the spatial dimension . in the next step ,",
    "the spinwave hamiltonian ( [ eq : hsw ] ) is transformed to momentum representation by introducing bosonic operators in momentum space : @xmath90 with @xmath91 the resultant hamiltonian can then be straightforwardly diagonalized by a bogoliubov transformation to yield the single particle dispersion : @xmath92      at the mean field level , the paramagnetic state , @xmath93 is the lowest energy state for large enough @xmath24 , as long as the applied magnetic field remains below a critical value @xmath35 .",
    "since the unitary transformation can be chosen as the identity , @xmath94 , the quasiparticle dispersion becomes particularly simple in the qpm phase : @xmath95 both branches have the same dispersion at zero field , @xmath45 , as expected from time reversal symmetry .",
    "a finite @xmath96 splits the branches linearly in @xmath96 without changing the dispersion .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the external field couples to the total magnetization , @xmath97 , which is a conserved quantity .",
    "both branches have a minimum at the afm wave - vector @xmath98 that determines the size of the gap .",
    "the dispersion is quadratic near @xmath98 except for the critical point @xmath99 that separates the qpm phase from the cafm phase at @xmath45 .",
    "the field induced qcp then belongs to the bec universality class in dimension @xmath20 . by expanding around @xmath98",
    ", we obtain : @xmath100 it is clear from this expression that the effective mass of the magnetic excitations vanishes for @xmath101 : @xmath102 .",
    "this is indeed the expected behavior if we keep in mind that the dispersion must be linear at the the critical point @xmath99 ( @xmath103 for the o(2 ) qcp as we discussed in the introduction ) .",
    "the qpm ground state remains stable for @xmath104 the ground state becomes fully polarized over the saturation field @xmath105 and the mean field state , @xmath106 coincides with the exact ground sate .",
    "the energy of the system is proportional to the applied field as expected .",
    "the two branches of magnetic excitations above the saturated state are given by : @xmath107 the flat branch , @xmath108 , describes the approximated spectrum of two - magnon bound states that appear above a critical value of the single - ion anisotropy @xcite .    by comparing eqs . and",
    ", we can see that the masses of the gapless bosons at the two field induced qcps , @xmath109 and @xmath110 can be very different : @xmath111 while the mass renormalization factor @xmath112 may not be quantitatively accurate , the obtained mean field critical exponent , @xmath113 , is correct for @xmath114 up to logarithmic corrections , because @xmath115 is the upper critical dimension for the o(2 ) qcp in dimension @xmath116 . for @xmath117",
    "we have @xmath118 and the mean field exponent @xmath119 is not correct for @xmath120 .",
    "it is clear then that quantum paramagnets which are close to the cafm instability ( @xmath121 ) should exhibit a very large asymmetry between the mass of the bosonic excitations for @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "this is indeed the case of the compound dtn whose thermodynamic properties exhibit a large asymmetry between the the two critical points at @xmath35 and @xmath43 .",
    "the possibility of having a relatively large @xmath124 ratio that can be tuned with pressure allows for measuring dependence of different physical properties on the mass of the bosonic excitations .",
    "this property of certain quantum paramagnets is particularly useful for unveiling the dominant scattering mechanism for thermal conductivity , @xmath125 , because different mechanisms usually lead to different dependences of @xmath125 on the mass of the quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "while the linear approach that we have described gives the correct qualitative picture in @xmath114 , it is still far from being quantitatively accurate in @xmath114 or @xmath1 , as we will see in the next sections .",
    "this shortcoming can be a serious problem for comparisons against experimental data .",
    "in particular , the hamiltonian parameters for quantum paramagnets are normally extracted from fits of the quasiparticle dispersions that are measured with ins @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the obtained hamiltonian parameters depends on the accuracy of the approach that is used for computing the dispersions @xmath126 .",
    "moreover , for quantum paramagnets like dtn which have low critical fields , @xmath127 , the linear approach normally predicts afm ordering at @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to modify the linear approach in order to obtain a quantitatively accurate description of the low field paramagnetic ground state and the low - energy excitations . as we shall see in the next sections , the modified approach that was originally applied to the description of dtn @xcite and that we describe in the rest of this subsection , is quantitatively accurate for @xmath114 and @xmath1 .    in the modified approach",
    "we replace eq .",
    "by @xmath128 and impose the constraint at a mean field level by introducing the lagrange multiplier @xmath129 : @xmath130 the rest of the procedure is similar to spin - wave theory , i.e. , we only keep terms up to quadratic order in the bosonic operators @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) and diagonalize the resulting quadratic hamiltonian via a bogolyubov transformation .",
    "this procedure leads to the diagonal form , but with a modified quasiparticle dispersion , @xmath133 relative to the expression that was obtained from the linear approximation .",
    "we note that the new dispersion can be obtained from the previous one if we replace @xmath24 by @xmath129 and @xmath25 by @xmath134 . therefore , in the quantum paramagnetic state",
    ", the net effect of including a lagrange multiplier to enforce the constraint at the mean field level is a renormalization of the single - ion anisotropy and exchange parameters .    the parameters @xmath135 and @xmath129 are determined self - consistently by the saddle point equations @xcite : @xmath136 by explicitly computing the left hand side of these two equations we obtain the following expressions : @xmath137 the stability conditions for the qpm ground state are replaced by @xmath138 as we will see in the next sections , the quantum phase diagram that is obtained from these modified conditions is in much better agreement with qmc simulations .",
    "the same is true for the modified quasiparticle dispersion .      to describe the cafm phase",

    "the afm ordered phase is invariant under the product of a translation by one lattice parameter and a time reversal transformation .",
    "this symmetry implies that @xmath141 , i.e. , the local moments have equal weights in the @xmath142 states . by minimizing the mean field energy as a function of the remaining variational parameter , @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath143 the dispersion relation consists of two non - degenerate branches that , in the low energy limit ( @xmath144 ) , are given by @xmath145    unfortunately",
    ", the modified approach based on the inclusion of a lagrange multiplier that we introduced in the previous subsection does not work well inside the ordered phase .",
    "both branches become gapped inside the ordered phase , i.e. , the approach misses the goldstone mode associated with the spontaneous breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry of global spin rotations along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "as we explained above , the magnetic field induced quantum phase transition from the qpm to the cafm phase is qualitatively different from the transition between the same two phases that is induced by a change of @xmath24 at @xmath45 .",
    "shows that the effect of increasing @xmath96 from zero at a fixed @xmath146 is to reduce the gap , @xmath147 , linearly in @xmath96 .",
    "the dispersion does not change because @xmath96 couples to @xmath148 that is a conserved quantity ( @xmath149 for the spin excitations that have dispersion @xmath150 ) .",

    "the field induced qcp then belongs to the bec universality class in dimension @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the single - ion anisotropy is continuously decreased at zero applied field , the two branches remain degenerate and the gap vanishes at @xmath152 ( @xmath45 ) .",

    "one of the branches , @xmath155 , remains gapless with a linear dispersion at low energy ( corresponding to the goldstone mode of the ordered cafm state ) whereas the other mode develops a gap to the lowest excitation .    in the following sections",
    ", we shall use large scale quantum monte carlo simulations of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) to demonstrate that the introduction of a lagrange multiplier significantly improves the quantitative description of the qpm phase , and that the linear approximation gives a qualitatively correct description of the quantum phase transitions in @xmath114 . as expected , in @xmath1 , the only deviation from mean field behavior occurs at the o(2 ) qcp , @xmath156 and @xmath45 , because the effective dimension , @xmath157 , is lower than four .",
    "we have used two different qmc methods , the standard stochastic series expansion ( sse ) with loop updates @xcite and a modified version developed in ref .  , to study the ground state and finite temperature properties of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) .",

    "ordinarily , the sse would suffer from the negative sign problem for the afm heisenberg interaction .",
