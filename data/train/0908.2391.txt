    "the pion form factor , @xmath9 , in the @xmath4 resonance region has been the subject of several recent experiments @xcite which , together , provide the most precise picture yet of the structure of the @xmath4 resonance , including the prominent @xmath0 interference ` shoulder ' .",
    "the markedly improved precision of the new data ( e.g. a statistical uncertainty of 1% versus 4 - 5% for earlier studies @xcite ) enables high - precision studies of isospin breaking in the @xmath0 sector and an improved determination of the dominant @xmath10 contribution to the leading order hadronic vacuum polarization term in standard model ( sm ) estimates of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath11 .",
    "isospin breaking in the @xmath0 sector is of particular and ongoing importance to studies of charge symmetry breaking in the @xmath8 interaction ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for more details ) .",
    "significant unresolved questions include _",
    "i ) _ the precise scale of the @xmath0 mixing matrix element , @xmath12 , in the region of the @xmath4 and _ ii ) _ the scale of the contribution associated with the unavoidable direct ( i.e. non - mixing induced ) isospin - breaking @xmath6 transition , which has often been neglected in determining @xmath13 .",
    "previous analyses of these issues ( e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite ) were hindered by data of relatively lower precision , making a precise determination of the phase between the @xmath4 and @xmath14 contributions impossible . without a well - constrained phase ,",
    "it is not possible to obtain a well - constrained estimate of the direct @xmath6 contribution , and the uncertainty in @xmath15 remains large ( in fact much greater than what is often quoted , for example in ref .",
    "the recent wealth of high - precision @xmath16 data in the resonance region represents a good first step in addressing these concerns . in this paper",
    "we revisit @xmath0 mixing in @xmath9 and use the recent data to effect a separation of @xmath6 and mixing contributions , from which we determine the ratio of isospin - breaking ( ib ) to isospin - conserving ( ic ) couplings , @xmath17 , and the off - diagonal vector meson self - energy matrix element @xmath15 .",
    "we perform this analysis using a selection of models for @xmath18 in order to clarify the numerical significance of the unavoidable model dependence of such a separation .",
    "one important reason for the recent interest in @xmath18 is the dominant role it plays in theoretical estimates of the leading order ( lo ) hadronic contribution to @xmath19 , @xmath20^{lo}_{had}$ ] .",
    "@xmath21 is now known experimentally to a remarkable 0.5 parts - per - million precision as a result of bnl experiment e821 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that @xmath22_{had}^{lo}$ ] which , after the purely leptonic contribution , is the largest of the sm contributions to @xmath21 , can be obtained from a weighted integral of the @xmath23 cross - section  @xcite , with the dominant contribution coming from the broad @xmath4 resonance .",
    "precise data on the @xmath24 cross - section ( or , equivalently , @xmath18 ) below 1 gev is , therefore , a crucial ingredient in the determination of @xmath22_{had}^{lo}$ ] .",
    "use of recent @xmath25 data as input for the @xmath10 part of @xmath22_{had}^{lo}$ ] leads to sm estimates for @xmath19 which are consistent with one another ( even though the form factor measurements themselves do not all agree on the precise @xmath26-dependence of @xmath18 @xcite ) , but which deviate from the experimental value by @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "( it should be noted , however , that preliminary radiative return results from babar differ from previous electroproduction results @xcite . )",
    "as is well known  @xcite , in the isospin limit , cvc allows the @xmath28 isovector contribution to @xmath20^{lo}_{had}$ ] to be computed using hadronic @xmath2 decay data  @xcite in place of the corresponding isovector electroproduction ( em ) data . at the present level of precision , additional small isospin - breaking corrections to the cvc relation  @xcite",
    "must be taken explicitly into account .",
    "we denote the collection of such corrections by @xmath29_{had}^{lo}$ ] in what follows . incorporating the isovector @xmath2 decay data in this manner ,",
    "one obtains estimates for the sm contribution to @xmath19 which deviate from the experiment by @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the low - energy region from which the bulk of the sm contribution to @xmath22_{had}^{lo}$ ] is generated is dominated by the @xmath10 component of the em cross - section .",
    "the ib corrections in this region , which have been extensively studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , are believed to be well understood .",
    "however , the component of these corrections associated with @xmath0 mixing , which in general is model dependent , has , to date , usually been estimated from fits to @xmath18 which employ only a single model for @xmath18 ( usually that of refs .",
    "this procedure turns out to lead to a significant underestimate of the resulting uncertainty , and hence also of the uncertainty in the @xmath2 decay - based value of the two - pion contribution to @xmath22^{lo}_{had}$ ] .    in ref .",
    "@xcite several models were used to examine the model - dependence of @xmath31^{lo}_{had}$ ] .",
    "it was found that the variation across models was significantly greater than the uncertainty ( associated with errors in the experimental data ) obtained for any individual model , though not to such an extent that it would resolve the @xmath2 vs. @xmath16 discrepancy .",
    "it should be borne in mind in this regard that finite energy sum rule studies of the electromagnetic current - current correlator  @xcite , based on the then - current em database , yielded values of @xmath32 , which are @xmath33 low compared to recent high - precision lattice determinations  @xcite . in contrast , analogous studies of the charged isovector current correlator  @xcite , based on the final version of the aleph hadronic @xmath2 decay data  @xcite , yield a value of @xmath34 , in excellent agreement with the new lattice results .",
    "the preliminary babar results for the @xmath35 cross - sections reported by davier at tau08  @xcite , moreover , are in better agreement with @xmath2 expectations than with previous em results , also favoring the @xmath2 determination , though the @xmath2-em discrepancy has been reduced by the recent re - assessment of ib corrections performed in ref .",
    "the question of whether the determination of @xmath20^{lo}_{had}$ ] incorporating @xmath2 data , or that based solely on em cross - sections , is the most reliable thus remains an open one .",
    "the goal of achieving as accurate as possible an understanding of the uncertainty on the ib correction , @xmath36^{lo}_{had}$ ] , to be applied to the raw @xmath2-based version of @xmath20^{lo}_{had}$ ] thus remains a highly relevant one .    in the present paper ,",
    "we update the analysis of the @xmath0 mixing contribution to @xmath37^{lo}_{had}$ ] contained in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking into account the corrected version of the snd @xmath38 data  @xcite , the new cmd-2 @xmath38 results  @xcite , and the latest initial state radiation ( isr ) determination of @xmath9 , from kloe  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we provide details of the fit results associated with the various models of @xmath9 , and new results for the separation of the ib part of the em cross - sections into pure @xmath0 mixing and direct @xmath7 coupling induced contributions . we find that , taking the model dependence of the @xmath0 contribution to @xmath31_{had}^{lo}$ ] into account , the uncertainty assigned to this quantity should be increased by @xmath39 .",
    "the improved data also allows for a more reliable separation of @xmath0 mixing and direct non - mixing @xmath6 contributions to @xmath9 . the uncertainty in the scale of the non - mixing contribution , while still large due to weak constraints on the relative phase of the @xmath14 and @xmath4 contributions to the amplitude , is reduced by a factor of two compared to the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite and favors a non - zero value . as a result ,",
    "the central value of @xmath1 is significantly different from that obtained using analyses in which direct @xmath14 contributions are ignored .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ models ] reviews the different models of @xmath9 considered in our analysis ; section [ data ] discusses the four recent @xmath24 data sets and the results of fits to each set using the models of section [ models ] ; section [ gminus2ib ] updates estimates of the @xmath0 contribution to @xmath31_{had}^{lo}$ ] ; and , finally , section [ mow ] reviews the ( model - dependent ) separation of the direct @xmath6 and mixing contributions to @xmath18 and presents the results of that analysis for the models and data sets of sections [ models ] and [ data ] .",
    "many recent estimates of the @xmath0 mixing contribution to @xmath37^{lo}_{had}$ ] , which we denote by @xmath37^{lo}_{had;mix}$ ] in what follows , have often been based on a model of @xmath18 which supplements the chpt - based formulation of guerrero and pich ( gp )  @xcite with a @xmath0 mixing contribution as proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( cen ) .",
    "we refer to this model as the gp / cen model .",
    "however , @xmath18 is well - described by many other models in the literature .",
    "various analyses have used the khn - santamaria ( ks ) model  @xcite , the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) model  @xcite , and the gounaris - sakurai ( gs ) model  @xcite .",
    "each model differs in the manner in which the dominant @xmath4 contribution to @xmath9 is represented , with the gs and gp / cen models explicitly taking account of strong final state interactions in @xmath24 .",
    "the use of models for @xmath18 is unavoidable at present if one wishes to separate the ic and ib contributions to the em cross - sections in the interference region , this separation being necessary for an estimate of @xmath37^{lo}_{had;mix}$ ] .",
    "the ks model  @xcite combines contributions from the @xmath4 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 resonances in such a way as to satisfy the charge constraint @xmath42 .",
    "an @xmath14 contribution of the nominal @xmath0 mixing form is added to account for the narrow interference shoulder .",
    "the resulting expression for @xmath9 is  @xcite @xmath43 where the vector meson propagator is given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are complex - valued constants . unless otherwise stated , @xmath48 is the standard @xmath26-dependent width implied by @xmath49-wave phase space for the decay of the vector meson @xmath50 , explicitly for the @xmath4 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and @xmath53 with @xmath54 approximated by a constant .",
    "an alternate version of the ks model , referred to in what follows as ks@xmath55 , is also sometimes employed in the literature .",
    "the ks@xmath55 form for @xmath9 is @xmath56 it is this alternate version which is employed in ref .",
    "because of strong cancellations in the region of the @xmath57 interference shoulder , the ks and ks@xmath55 models produce significantly different results for @xmath37^{lo}_{had;mix}$ ] .",
    "we return to this point below .",
    "the hls model  @xcite of @xmath9 has the form @xmath58 with @xmath59 a constant associated with a non - resonant @xmath60 coupling .",
    "despite having no explicit contribution from higher resonances such as the @xmath40 , the model provides a good quality fit to the data below @xmath61 gev .",
    "it also turns out to produce the correct @xmath9 phases in the elastic @xmath10 scattering region after the model parameters have been fitted  @xcite , though the phase constraint is not imposed in the basic structure of the model .",
    "the gs model  @xcite , as adopted by cmd-2 @xcite and used here , is given by @xmath62 +     \\beta { \\rm bw}_{\\rho^\\prime}^{(gs)}(s)\\right ) \\label{gsmodel}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 with @xmath64 +      ( m_v^2-s)p_{\\pi}^2(m_v^2){\\frac{dh}{ds}}(m_v^2)\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ h(s ) & = & { \\frac{2 p_{\\pi}(s)}{\\pi\\sqrt{s}}}\\ , \\ell n\\left (       { \\frac{\\sqrt{s } + 2 p_{\\pi}(s)}{2 m_{\\pi}}}\\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the pion cm momentum for squared invariant mass @xmath26 and @xmath66 .",
    "the elastic @xmath10 scattering phase constraint on @xmath9 is reproduced by the gs model by explicit construction .    for the ks , hls , and gs models , the constant @xmath45 , which parameterizes the strength of the narrow ib amplitude ,",

    "@xcite the gp / cen model was extended in this way , treating the phase of @xmath82 as a fourth parameter to be fit to the data , and an acceptable fit became possible .",
    "we refer to this version of the gp / cen model as gp / cen@xmath83 below . in most of what follows ,",
    "however , we will focus instead on an alternate version of the gp / cen model , referred to below as gp / cen@xmath84 , which incorporates the effects of strong @xmath10 rescattering not only in the isospin - conserving @xmath85 contribution ( the first term on the rhs of eq .  [ gpcenmodel ] ) , but also in the @xmath4 propagator factor of the isospin - breaking @xmath57 mixing contribution , leading to @xmath86 where , as in the gp / cen@xmath83 version , @xmath81 is allowed to have a non - zero phase .",
    "recent information on @xmath9 in the interference region has been provided by the cmd-2 and snd experiments at novosibirsk and kloe at dafne .",

    "we refer to these as cmd-2(94 ) and cmd-2(98 ) , respectively .",
    "the 1998 run has five times the luminosity of the earlier run , and correspondingly smaller statistical errors , but a less precise beam energy calibration . whereas the beam energy was measured very precisely using resonant depolarization for cmd-2(94 ) , this technique was not available for cmd-2(98 )  @xcite with the result that the beam energy for the latter is only known to a few parts in @xmath89  @xcite . a significant part of the beam energy uncertainty , moreover , is fully correlated @xcite .",

    "the less precise energy calibration of cmd-2(98 ) also has an impact on studies of isospin breaking in @xmath18 because such studies require a precise experimental characterization of the interference shoulder .",

    "a new analysis has recently been completed using data collected in 2002 and an improved analysis strategy  @xcite .",

    "although a contribution from the @xmath41 appears in the ks model , we have found that , because the data we consider is limited to @xmath100 below 1 gev , it provides insufficient constraints on this term .",

    "<S> we study the implications of several recent high - precision measurements of the pion form factor in the region of the @xmath0 interference `` shoulder '' for ( i ) the extraction of the @xmath0 mixing matrix element , @xmath1 , and ( ii ) the evaluation of the isospin - breaking ( ib ) correction needed to incorporate hadronic @xmath2 decay data into the determination of the standard model expectation for the leading order hadronic contribution , @xmath3_{had}^{lo}$ ] , to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , focussing , in the latter case , on the model - dependence of the @xmath0 mixing component of the ib correction . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a range of different models for the broad @xmath4 contribution to the @xmath5 amplitude , applying these models to each experimental data set , and find that the model dependence of the @xmath0 mixing correction is significantly larger than the uncertainty induced by experimental errors for any individual model . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that , for each such model , the recent data allows one to separate @xmath0 mixing and direct @xmath6 coupling contributions to the amplitude , and hence to obtain a reasonably precise extraction of @xmath1 , uncontaminated by direct @xmath7 coupling effects , for use in meson exchange model calculations of charge symmetry breaking in @xmath8 scattering .    . </S>"
