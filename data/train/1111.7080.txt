    "alice ( a large ion collider experiment ) is a general - purpose heavy - ion experiment at the cern lhc ( large hadron collider ) aimed at studying the physics of strongly - interacting matter and the quark  gluon plasma .",
    "a unique design has been adopted for the alice detector to fulfill tracking and particle - identification requirements  @xcite .",
    "thanks to these features the experiment is able to identify hadrons in a wide momentum range by combining different detecting systems and techniques , as discussed in section  [ sec : pid ] .",
    "results on hadron spectra and yields at mid - rapidity are presented in section  [ sec : ppresults ] for pp collisions at @xmath0  =  0.9  tev and 7  tev and in section  [ sec : pbpbresults ] for pb ",
    "pb collisions at @xmath1  =  2.76  tev .",
    "in this section the particle - identification ( pid ) detectors relevant for the analyses presented in this paper are briefly discussed , namely the _ inner tracking system _ ( its ) , the _ time - projection chamber _ ( tpc ) and the _ time - of - flight _ detector ( tof ) . a detailed review of the alice experiment and of its pid capabilities can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the its is a six - layer silicon detector located at radii between 4 and 43 cm .",
    "four of the six layers provide @xmath2 measurements and are used for particle identification in the non - relativistic ( @xmath3 ) region .",
    "moreover , using the its as a standalone tracker enables one to reconstruct and identify low - momentum particles ( below  200  mev / c ) not reaching the main tracking systems .",
    "the tpc is the main central - barrel tracking detector of alice and provides three - dimensional hit information and specific energy - loss measurements with up to 159 samples . with the measured particle momentum and",
    "@xmath4 the particle type can be determined by comparing the measurements against the bethe - bloch expectation .",
    "the tof detector is a large - area array of multigap resistive plate chambers ( mrpc ) and covers the central pseudorapidity region ( @xmath5  0.9 , full azimuth ) .",
    "particle identification is performed by matching momentum and trajectory - length measurements performed by the tracking system with the time - of - flight information provided by the tof system .",
    "the total time - of - flight resolution is about 85  ps in pb  pb collisions ( about 120  ps in pp collisions ) and it is determined by the time resolution of the detector itself and by the start - time resolution .",
    "the transverse momentum spectra of primary @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are measured at mid - rapidity ( @xmath10 ) combining the techniques and detectors described above .",
    "primary particles are defined as prompt particles produced in the collision and all decay products , except products from weak decay of strange particles .",
    "the contribution from the feed - down of weakly - decaying particles to @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 and from protons from material are subtracted by fitting the data using monte carlo templates of the dca distributions .",
    "particles can also be identified in alice via their characteristics decay topology or invariant mass fits .",
    "this , combined with the direct identification of the decay daughters , allows one to reconstruct weakly - decaying particles and hadronic resonances with an improved signal - to - background ratio .",
