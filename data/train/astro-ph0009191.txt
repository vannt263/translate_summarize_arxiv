    "within the framework of the density wave theory @xcite , the spiral arms of disk galaxies are the manifestation of traveling waves . in a first approximation ,",
    "the pattern speed of a density wave is constant over the disk .",
    "it is widely known that galactic disks present differential rotation and in this way , in a given galaxy , there is a radial position where the density wave pattern speed coincides with the angular velocity of the stellar disk .",
    "this radial position is know as the corotation resonance ( cr ) radius .",
    "the density wave pattern is slower than the disk material at radii smaller than the cr , and it is faster at radii larger than the cr , inducing shocks at different arms side inward and outward the cr .",
    "other resonances can be present in a given galaxy , mainly the ilr ( inner lindblad resonance ) , and the olr ( outer lindblad resonance ) .",
    "these resonances are placed when the condition @xmath5 is satisfied .",
    "here , @xmath6 is the pattern speed , @xmath7 is the angular velocity of the disk , @xmath8 is the epicyclic frequency , and the signals ` @xmath9 ' and ` @xmath10 ' refer to the ilr and the olr , respectively .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have previously discussed what would be the behavior of the colors across spiral arms if a shock generated by a spiral density wave ( sdw ) induces star formation .",
    "the main observable characteristic of this scenario are steeper azimuthal profiles and bluer color indices on the side where the shock front is located .",
    "@xcite proposed a photometric method to detect cr based on the comparison of blue and infrared frames azimuthal profiles fourier transform , under the basic idea that a shock - induced star formation in a sdw scenario produces an azimuthal gradient of ages across the spiral arms that has _ opposite signs _ on either side of the cr .",
    "the behavior of the azimuthal phase @xmath11 was schematically exemplified in fig.2 of @xcite , for leading and trailing waves of s- and z - type .",
    "@xcite pointed out that evidences for cr are clearly seen in gas rich galaxies in the form of sharp end points to star formation ridges and dust lanes in two armed spirals .",
    "photometric methods are widely used to detect resonances , mainly due to the spar in observing time .",
    "@xcite rise some doubts on the ability of photometric methods to uniquely determine cr in m100 . for this galaxy , @xcite ,",
    "using computing enhanced imagery , placed the cr radius at 110arcsec .",
    "this value was confirmed by @xcite , through the hi velocity field . on the other hand , two different methods based on h@xmath12 velocity field place the cr of m100 at around 75arcsec @xcite .",
    "that shows for m100 that even the kinematical determination of cr from the velocity field of two different components do not lead to a unique result .",
    "perhaps , the hi streaming motions over m100 arms @xcite contribute to disturb sdw kinematics , indicating that perturbations in disks of galaxies sometimes produce more complex spatial structures and/or kinematical patterns than those suggested by simple models .    in this paper , we use and discuss again the azimuthal profiles phase method @xcite to analyze the grand design spiral galaxies ngc1365 , ngc1566 and ngc2997 , recalling the curious result on multiple cr obtained by these authors for ngc1832 and ngc7479 . ngc1365 and ngc1566 belong to @xcite arm class 12 ( ` two long symmetric arms dominating the optical disk ' ) , while ngc2997 belongs to the arm class 9 ( ` two symmetric inner arms ; multiple long and continuous outer arms ' ) .    furthermore , in this paper we present a method to quantitatively determine errors .",
    "this procedure allows to determine a range of validity in radius for the azimuthal profiles phase method , a critical issue in @xcite letter .",
    "we apply the azimuthal profiles phase method on the rough @xmath2 and @xmath3 images , as done by @xcite , but also to images computer - treated with the method of @xcite , and that based on modes search by two - dimensional fourier analysis @xcite .",
    "the galaxies discussed in this paper were observed in november , 1998 , at the ctio 0.9 m telescope . for each galaxy , three images with each of gunn s @xmath2 and @xmath3 filters were taken , with exposure time 500 seconds each image .",
    "the standard reduction was carried out using the iraf package . since our focus is morphology ,",
    "no calibration were required . as a first step",
    ", all images were centered using field stars .",
    "thereafter , field stars were removed using the iraf _ imedit _ task . in order to enhance the perturbation over the galaxy s disks we subtract the mean radial light profile and",
    "then we normalize the rms variation of the intensity at each radius to a constant value throughout the image , as done by @xcite .",
    "the galaxies were then deprojected running a program that maps ellipses into circles .",
    "shock induced star formation in a stellar density wave scenario produces an azimuthal spread of ages across the spiral arms . at the cr , the angular velocity of the perturbation ( @xmath6 ) and that of the stellar disk ( @xmath13 ) coincide .",
    "a comoving observer at the cr will see outward and inward the shock front to change from one side of the spiral to the other , consequently reversing the order in which young and older disk stellar population appear in azimuthal profiles across the arms . in order to detect the shock front jump",
    ", @xcite proposed to analyze the relative behavior of the sdw and shock front phases respectively , by means of the fourier transform of azimuthal profiles @xmath14 given for m=2 by    @xmath15    the phase @xmath11 can be obtained for m=2 as    @xmath16}{im[f_2(r)]}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 mean the real and imaginary parts of the complex fourier coefficients . in figs . 1 and 2 of @xcite",
    ", one can find a graphic representation of @xmath11 behavior for ` s ' and ` z ' arms of trailing and leading character .",
    "this method was also successfully used by @xcite to find cr in barred galaxies .",
    "the sdw phase and the newly formed stars one are respectively identified with @xmath19=@xmath20 and @xmath21=@xmath22 , where the right terms are obtained from infrared @xmath3 and blue @xmath2 images , respectively .",
    "an azimuthal profile phase difference ( hereinafter , appd ) @xmath23=0 $ ] , will indicate the presence of a cr .",
    "we also search in this paper for the existence of the m=3 component . for this component",
    "the phase @xmath24 is given by    @xmath25}{im[f_3(r)]}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath26      the basic idea for errors determination is that if the phase differences in the comparison of @xmath2 and @xmath3 images reflect an statistical fluctuation , it should also be reflected when different single filter images are compared among them . in order to quantitatively evaluate the errors intrinsic to the appd method , we obtained three different images in @xmath2 and @xmath3 filters .",
    "we co - added @xmath27+@xmath28 and @xmath28+@xmath29 and compute the phase difference of the resulting images .",
    "the same procedure is applied to the @xmath3 images . when comparing single filter images of a given galaxy , the global aspect of the appd is that of a high frequency statistical fluctuation ( white noise ) , while appd of @xmath2 against @xmath3 images produces low frequency phase differences , as we will see further on .",
    "we assume that an appd that locally reach values larger than 3@xmath30 constitutes a real signal .      in order to separate m=2 and m=3 spiral pattern components",
    "we apply two methods , namely , that of @xcite and the one based on two - dimensional fourier transform @xcite .",
    "these authors propose to separate the two- and three - fold symmetric part of a galaxy spiral pattern , s@xmath31 and s@xmath32 respectively , by making successive images rotations and subtractions . if @xmath33 is the original image in polar coordinates , then    @xmath34_t\\ ] ]    and    @xmath35_t\\,-\\,[i(r , \\theta)\\,-\\,i(r,\\theta-\\frac{2\\pi}{3})]_t\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 stands for truncation , meaning that pixels with negative intensities are set to 0 .",
    "this method has been extensively discussed in a number of papers @xcite . in the fourier method ,",
    "an image is decomposed on a basis of logarithmic spiral of the form @xmath37 .",
    "the fourier coefficients @xmath38 can be written as    @xmath39 d u d \\theta\\ ] ]    here , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the polar coordinates , @xmath43 represents the number of the arms , @xmath44 is related to the pitch angle @xmath12 of the spiral as @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the distribution of light of a given deprojected galaxy , in a plane .",
    "@xmath47 is a normalization factor written as    @xmath48    obs . : in practice , the integrals in @xmath40 are calculated from a minimum radius ( selected to exclude the bulge where there is no information on the arms ) to a maximum radius ( which extends to the outer limits of the arms in our images ) .",
    "the inverse fourier transform can be written as    @xmath49    where @xmath50 stands for the radial density profile of the @xmath43 component , written as    @xmath51    and @xmath52 is a high frequency filter used to smooth the @xmath38 spectra at the interval ends @xcite , which has the form    @xmath53\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is the value of @xmath44 for which the amplitude of the fourier coefficients for a given @xmath43 is maximum .",
    "the chosen interval ends ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , as well as the step @xmath57 , are suitable for the analysis of galactic spiral arms .",
    "so , by using 2d fourier transforms , we can separate any m - mode . for example",
    ", the m=2 mode can be analyzed using @xmath58 , and so on .",
    "the disk subtracted and rectified to face - on images of ngc1365 in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 filters , are presented in figure [ ima1365_g_i ] .",
    "two dimensional fourier analysis shows that the spiral structure in ngc1365 is mainly composed of m=2 components , in both , @xmath2 and @xmath3 frames ( figure [ fouspec1365 ] ) .",
    "the strong signal appearing in m=4 and m=6 are only aliases of m=2 @xcite . nevertheless , the radial dependence of the m=2 arm intensity p@xmath31(r ) is not similar in both frames , as figure [ smr1365 ] shows . up to 10kpc ,",
    "the sdw intensity , represented by the old stellar component , p@xmath59 , predominates on that of the perturbed material , represented by the newly formed stars , p@xmath60 . from 13kpc outwards",
    ", p@xmath59 weakens compared to p@xmath60 .",
    "when compared with numerical models , it becomes an interesting method to determine the pattern age , as we will see in section 3.2 .",
    "the identification of resonances in barred spirals is a matter of increasing interest for many reasons related to the sdw theory . by example , the self - consistent modeling of real systems @xcite , the study of the time evolution of sdw ( formation , dumping , etc ) and related induced star formation @xcite , and the study of non - linear coupling among different spirals modes @xcite , are interesting , even open , problems .",
    "resonances in ngc1365 have been kinematically analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they place the cr resonance at 13.8kpc and 15.2kpc ( r@xmath61/r@xmath62 1.15 and 1.3 ) , respectively .",
    "@xcite , point that in models where the disk suffers a pure bar perturbation , a pattern speed higher than 20@xmath631km / sec / kpc ( corresponding to smaller cr radii ) tends to give spirals more tighty wound than observed .",
    "they also point out that the cr radius should be even more external , if the perturbation is composed by a bar plus spiral arms .",
    "nevertheless , as mentioned by these authors the evolution of the gaseous and/or stellar system to its present form is beyond the scope of their paper .",
    "this evolution precisely transforms dramatically the spiral pattern parameters ( number of arms , pitch angle , etc . ) , distinctly in old and young components , as can be seen in @xcite self - consistent numerical experiments .",
    "this might explain the difference between @xcite and @xcite results .",
    "our results are more similar to those of @xcite , as we will see in the next paragraph .    in figure [ rectifica1365 ] we present the rectified @xmath2 image , in a logr vs. @xmath42 diagram @xcite .",
    "in this plot we can see more precisely the different arm structures .",
    "the bar extends up to 10.3kpc and its axis is strictly straight , as can be better seen in the western arm , which is less disturbed by the dust lane .",
    "the dust lane presents an open spiral form , with pitch angle @xmath64 with extension similar to that of the bar . the bisymmetrical arms present two different pitch angles . at the beginning it has @xmath65 , and extends itself from the end of the bar up to 17.5kpc .",
    "the rest of the arm , up to @xmath6628kpc , has @xmath67 .",
    "it has to be pointed out that the pitch angle change is not an artifact introduced by the galaxy warping , since the galaxy was corrected by an inclination @xmath68 and the warping does not depart more than 15@xmath69 from this value .",
    "moreover , the warping begins at @xmath6625kpc @xcite .",
    "we present in figures [ phase+error_pure1365 ] , [ phase+error_eem1365 ] and [ phase+error_four1365 ] the behavior of the m=2 appd of the original images ( @xmath70_{orig}$ ] ) , and those transformed by eem92 ( @xmath70_{eem}$ ] ) and fourier ( @xmath70_{four}$ ] ) methods .",
    "the corresponding errors in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are obtained according to the prescriptions of section2.3 .    in figure [ phase+error_pure1365 ]",
    ", one can see that inside 5kpc the s / n is too high , mainly in the @xmath3 band , as to advance any conclusion . between @xmath66 6kpc and 15kpc ,",
    "@xmath70 $ ] comfortably overcome the noise by many @xmath30 . beyond 15kpc , it is again strongly affected by the noise .",
    "the cr at the extreme of the bar is set at 10.7kpc by this method .",
    "the more internal cuts are probably produced by the influence of the dust lane , whose curvature is different from that of the stellar bar .",
    "@xmath71_{eem}$ ] and @xmath71_{four}$ ] present a similar behavior than that of the original images , but with a better s / n .",
    "the cr is set at 13.8 and 11.8kpc respectively by these two methods , with a mean value in close agreement to @xcite determination .",
    "both methods show a tendency to unravel a cr at 25kpc , distance at which the disk begin to warp . but the error in the @xmath3 image increase strongly , and prevent any conclusion on the reality of this cr .",
    "deeper imagery could help to better understand the sdw behavior in this region .    according to the rotation curve of @xcite",
    ", the mean value for the cr radius of r@xmath61=12.1kpc leads to a pattern speed @xmath72=25.0km / s / kpc .",
    "we have searched for the presence of m=3 component , by means of eem92 and fourier transform methods , but this component is not significant in ngc1365 ( see the spectrum for m=3 in fig . [ fouspec1365 ] ) .",
    "the m=1 component appears to weak in the fourier analysis , and prevent any cr study .",
    "@xcite performed numerical models of disk galaxies with n=1 toomre s disks of stars and gas .",
    "in all the experiments they used a radial scale length , a@xmath73=3.5kpc and 4.0kpc , for the star disk , and a@xmath74=6.0kpc for the gaseous disk .",
    "the extend of their stellar and gaseous disks is 12kpc and 16kpc , respectively .",
    "their models were completed with a plummer s bulge with scale length , a@xmath75 ranging from 1/4.5 to 1/3 of a@xmath73 , and mass equal to that of the stellar disk .",
    "these models do not have halo . @xcite",
    "present the evolution of the stars and gas spiral patterns between 20myr and 2000myr for ten different experiments .",
    "ngc1365 compares very well to their experiment e. it has a@xmath73=3 kpc , and a@xmath75=1 . in this numerical experiment , they found that the arm structure , which is multiple armed at 200myr , becomes two - armed at 800myr .",
    "from there on , the radial behavior of the m=2 fourier intensity of young p@xmath76 and old p@xmath77 stellar population , which were fairly similar at 200myr , begin to differentiate between them .",
    "p@xmath77 predominates in the inner 1/4 of the disk length , and p@xmath76 outwards .",

    "these experiments are specially suited for ngc1365 because this galaxy does not possess an important halo , as clearly demonstrated by the highly keplerian behavior of the rotation curve for r@xmath7820kpc @xcite .",
    "the images in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 filters for ngc1566 , disk subtracted and rectified to face - on , are presented in figure [ ima1566_g_i ] .",
    "the rotation curve of this galaxy @xcite presents a high dispersion , because it is projected practically face - on on the sky . for this reason , a photometric analysis of the resonances",
    "is very appropriated in the case of ngc1566 @xcite .",
    "the hii regions spiral pattern of this galaxy was already analyzed using fourier transform by @xcite .",
    "the predominant pattern of this young stellar population is m=2 , with m=1 being progressively more important at radii larger than 17kpc .",
    "the present analysis of @xmath2 and @xmath3 imagery shows up the same property ( figure [ fouspec1566 ] ) .",
    "contrary to the case of ngc1365 , in ngc1566 the m=2 sdw intensity in the old stellar component p@xmath77 does not predominates in any part of the disk on that of the newly formed stars , p@xmath76 ( figure [ smr1566 ] ) .",
    "both functions decrease similarly and fade up simultaneously at about 22kpc .    for the one armed component",
    ", we note that between 10 and 13kpc p@xmath79 dominates on p@xmath80 , while in more external regions the contrary happens ( figure [ sm=1r1566 ] ) .",
    "the resonances of ngc1566 were studied by @xcite .",

    "as before , the corresponding errors in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are obtained according to the prescriptions of section2.3 .",
    "each one of the methods respectively places the cr at r@xmath66 9.7kpc ( fig .",

    "the arms bend themselves between 20 and 24kpc , with a different pitch angle , although the feature is too weak to further analysis .",
    "we search also for m=3 component in ngc1566 , but it is not important . on the other hand ,",
    "an m=1 component is present , although tenuously defined .",
    "one can warily locate its cr at 7.1kpc , without ilr , and pattern angular speed @xmath82=16.6km / sec / kpc .",

    "this last assessment has to be taken with caution , since @xcite model f that fits this galaxy , seems to be oversimplified to explain the scenario of the sdw in ngc2997 .",
    "the one - d fourier transform method , applied to @xmath2 ( blue ) and @xmath3 ( infrared ) images proposed by @xcite to detect cr , has been applied to three grand design galaxies , namely , ngc1365 , ngc1566 and ngc2997 .",
    "some improvements have been introduced in this paper , to make the analysis more reliable .",
    "the original treatment on rough images of @xcite , was this time complemented with the analysis of computer treated images , with 2-d fourier transform and eem92 methods .",
    "this complete procedure presents complementary aspects , which gives advantages with respect to the original one .",
    "for example , to work on the original image is very good for pure m=2 arms .",
    "when other components appear , fourier transform and eem92 methods work better .",
    "fourier method gives smaller errors than eem92 method , but eem92 method is more realistic than the former , since it is not constrained to describe the spiral as pure logarithmic ones .",
    "eem92 method also have detected nicely the presence of the m=3 component in ngc2997 .",
    "this method is extremely efficient in detecting this component , while fourier methods has to add many components .",
    "so , we confident can say that m=3 is not present in ngc1365 and ngc1566 , and also that ngc1566 presents an m=1 component .",
    "the method presented here to determine errors in the appd diagram , also represents a considerable improvement with respect to the original paper @xcite , that strongly helps to identify which is the level of confidence in a cr determination . in turn , it also helps to establish the correct observational time to verify the dubious cases . from this point of view",
    ", it will be important to check @xcite result on multiple cr in the galaxies ngc1832 and ngc7479 .",
    "nevertheless , more images of these galaxies are necessary to obtain a s / n in appd diagram .",
    "the present form of this diagram , as a phase difference rather than as the superposition of the phases in each color , is more instructive than the former one , specially to visualize the s / n .",
    "the determination of the arms extend has been made via logr vs. @xmath42 diagram and via rotation curve , once know the cr radius .",
    "the arm complexity as well as the relative arm intensity for perturbing sdw p@xmath77(r ) and perturbed material p@xmath76(r ) in the fourier diagram are related to the perturbations age .",
    "although model dependent , a comparison with suitable models , allows to establish a scale of ages for the galaxies analyzed here .",
    "that leads to think that these three objects present different phases of a single phenomenon , in spite of the strong bar in ngc1365 .",
    "these conclusions have to be further checked with more elaborated models and for a larger sample of galaxies .",
