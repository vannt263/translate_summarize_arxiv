    "the asymptotic behavior of the ground state electron density @xmath0 of a many - electron system in the limit of @xmath1 is determined by its ionization potential @xmath2 and is given as ( atomic units are used throughout the paper ) @xmath3 this has been shown in many different ways .",
    "some of these are as follows : morrel , levy and parr @xcite employed natural spin orbitals formed from the many - electron wavefunction to prove this .",
    "katriel and davidson @xcite derived the asymptotic form by analytic continuation of asymptotic scattering - state wavefunctions .",
    "von - barth @xcite worked in terms of quasi - particle amplitudes to show the above form .",
    "all these investigations were carried out on the basis of many - electron wavefunction .",
    "in contrast levy - perdew - sahni @xcite employed the density directly and proved eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . to do this they derived and used the following equation ( referred to as lps equation ) for the density @xmath4\\rho^{\\frac{1}{2}}(\\vec{r } ) = \\mu   \\rho^{\\frac{1}{2}}(\\vec{r } ) .",
    "\\label{eq2}\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath5 is the external potential @xmath6 like the nuclear potential in an atom @xmath6 that electrons are moving in and @xmath7 is the chemical potential . the latter is defined @xcite to be equal to the negative of the ionization potential .",
    "furthermore , @xmath8 is the effective potential that is the sum of the hartree potential @xcite , @xmath9 the exchange - correlation potential @xcite @xmath10}{\\delta \\rho(\\vec{r } ) } \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 $ ] is the unknown exchange - correlation energy functional and a kinetic energy component @xmath12}{\\delta \\rho(\\vec{r } ) } \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 = t_s[\\rho]-\\la \\rho^{\\frac{1}{2}}|-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2|\\rho^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ra \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] is obtained by subtracting @xmath14 from the non - interacting kinetic energy functional @xmath15 $ ] for a given ground state density .",
    "this term is also referred to as the pauli - term with @xmath16 @xcite as the pauli - potential .",
    "it is evident that for a two - electron system @xmath17 $ ] vanishes and @xmath18 is the sum of the hartree and the exchange - correlation potential . since the functionals @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath15 $ ] are not known , @xmath18 of the lps equation can not be calculated exactly using equations ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "we note though that the exchange - correlation potential can be constructed @xcite for a given ground state density .",
    "similarly @xmath18 can be calculated as @xmath19 however this equation can not be employed to gain insights into the behavior of @xmath18 that are needed to get the asymptotic structure of the density . to study the latter",
    ", lps derived an expression for @xmath18 in terms of the many - electron wavefunction of the system and used this to prove that if for @xmath1 , the density decreases as @xmath20 then @xmath21 on the other hand , using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) it can also be shown @xcite @xmath22 under certain conditions . from eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) it follows that @xmath23 it is clear that expression of @xmath18 in terms of the many electron wavefunction is crucial in developing an understanding of the behavior of @xmath18 and hence in proving eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "although @xmath18 in terms of the many - electron wavefunction is known , it has never been calculated explicitly .",
    "the reason for this is obvious : since @xmath18 is written in terms of the exact eigenfunction , its calculation requires highly accurate wavefunctions .",
    "thus even for two - electron system where the potential @xmath18 is known to be the sum of the hartree and the exchange - correlation potential , such a direct calculations has not been performed . as a result ,",
    "the lps equation for the density has never been solved exactly .",
    "this paper fills this gap for two - electron systems . in the following",
    "we first briefly review the main features of the lps equation and reproduces the expression for @xmath18 in terms of the many - electron wavefunction .",
    "we then describe the wavefunction that we employ to calculate @xmath18 for two - electron atoms and use it to construct @xmath18 .",
    "we solve the lps equation employing the @xmath18 so obtained and show that the resulting densities and ionization potentials are in excellent agreement with those calculated from the corresponding wavefunction .",
    "having solved the equation for @xmath18 constructed from an accurate wavefunction , we next perform a self - consistent calculation using the lps equation for the ground state density of two - electron atoms .",
    "we can do this because of the form of correlated wavefunction employed by us .",
    "this allows us to write the correlated wavefunction in terms of @xmath24 and calculate @xmath18 from it .",
    "we show that the solution converges to highly accurate results for the density and the chemical potential .",
    "the equation derived by lps for the density is that given in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "a time - dependent version of this equation was proposed independently by chattaraj and deb @xcite and solved by calculating @xmath18 employing approximate exchange - correlation and kinetic energy functional .",
    "recently the equation has also been solved for the @xmath25 atom by developing an equation for the pauli - potential given by eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and using an approximate energy functional for the exchange and correlation potential , thus still calculating @xmath18 approximately @xcite .",
    "lps , however , gave an exact expression for @xmath18 in terms of the many - electron wavefunction @xmath26 for @xmath27 electrons .",
    "this is given as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 represents both the space variable @xmath30 and spin variable @xmath31 .",
    "further , @xmath32 is a function defined via the equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 , is the many - electron wavefunction .",
    "@xmath35 is defined by splitting @xmath36 as @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the ground - state energy of the @xmath39 electron system .",
    "note that @xmath32 depends parametrically on @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus @xmath42 is not zero in general .",
    "finally @xmath43 is the density corresponding to @xmath44 with parametric dependence on @xmath40 . in the expression for @xmath18 ,",
    "each term is independently greater than zero ; the first and the third term are so because of the positive integrand and the second term is positive by the variational principal for the energy .",
    "thus @xmath45 for all values of @xmath30 .",
    "if for @xmath46 , @xmath47 decays as @xmath48 then from equation ( [ eq2 ] ) @xmath49 with @xmath45 , equation ( [ eq7 ] ) i.e. @xmath50 follows and the equality holds if @xmath51 .",
    "the potential @xmath52 vanishes as @xmath1 if @xmath44 collapses to the exact ground state function @xmath53 of the corresponding ion . to get the equality @xmath54",
    ", lps further consider the equation for the function @xmath55 and used this to prove eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "this can be consistent with @xmath57 only if @xmath58 .",
    "it is clear from the description above that structure and properties of @xmath18 are the basis of the proof by lps .",
    "as stated earlier , the potential @xmath18 has never been obtained in its exact form starting from a wavefunction even for two - electron systems where @xmath18 has no kinetic energy component and is thus equal to the sum of the hartree and the exchange - correlation potential . in this paper",
    "we calculate @xmath18 starting from an accurate wavefunction for 2-electron atomic systems .",
    "after calculated the effective potential we solve the lps equation both    for @xmath18 calculated from the accurate wavefunction employed by us    self - consistently .",
    "we show that the solution gives highly accurate densities and ionization energies for the these systems .    for a two - electron atomic system ,",
    "the electronic wavefunction @xmath59 is a singlet with the electrons having opposite spins .",
    "thus @xmath60 where @xmath61 furthermore , @xmath62 and    @xmath63    note the parametric dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath65 in the equation above .",
    "looking the equation ( [ eq18 ] ) , it is not obvious that @xmath66 will be equal to the sum of the hartree and the exchange - correlation potential . in the following",
    "we show numerically that it is indeed so employing two different semi - analytic wavefunction .",
    "these wavefunctions are described in the next section .",
    "to perform fundamental studies in density functional theory , one needs wavefunctions that not only give accurate energies but also equally accurate densities .",
    "furthermore , the wavefunction should have a form that is analytically simple so that it is easily employed for such studies .",
    "one such wavefunction is the le sech wavefunction @xcite for two - electron atoms .",
    "it is given as @xmath67 with @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the normalization constant and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the variational parameters .",
    "the wavefunction leads to energies that are within @xmath72 of the exact ground state energies@xcite for these systems . on the other hand",
    "the density that this wavefunction gives is not as accurate as the energies .",
    "for example , if the exchange - correlation potential @xmath73 is calculated for this density ( we do it using the zhao - parr method @xcite ) , it differs from the exact exchange - correlation potential near the nucleus significantly .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) where we have plotted the exchange - correlation potentials @xmath74 for the he atom and compared it to the exchange - correlation potential @xmath75 that obtained from the accurate density of umrigar and gonze @xcite ( ug ) .",
    "it is evident that from the nucleus upto about @xmath76au , the exchange - correlation potential obtained from the le sech density is less deep with the difference being close to @xmath77 .",
    "the wavefunction can be made more accurate by writing it in the modified form ( modified le sech wavefunction @xcite ) as @xmath78 where for each @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath79 is obtained by solving a schr@xmath80dinger - like equation for it .",
    "the function @xmath79 is suitably normalized so that @xmath81 .",
    "the appropriate ground state wavefunction corresponds to those @xmath70 and @xmath71 that lead to the least value of the energy .",
    "the optimized @xmath82 thus obtained improves @xcite both the energies and the densities for two electron systems .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) where we have also plotted the exchange - correlation potential @xmath83 for this density obtained from the modified le sech wavefunction .",
    "it is very close to the @xmath75 .",
    "and @xmath83 calculated for the densities obtained from le sech and modified le sech respectively .",
    "these are compared with exchange - correlation potential obtained from the exact density @xcite .",
    "[ fig1],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this paper we calculate @xmath18 and the corresponding exchange - correlation potential by employing both the le sech and the modified le sech wavefunctions of eqs .",
    "( [ psil ] ) and ( [ psiml ] ) respectively . after constructing @xmath18",
    ", we solve the lps equation ( eq . [ eq2 ] ) for the density by using the @xmath18 obtained from @xmath84 and @xmath82 .",
    "the solution gives both the density and the chemical potential for the system studied .",
    "finally by writing @xmath79 of eq .",
    "( [ psiml ] ) in terms of @xmath24 , we also solve the lps equation self - consistently .",

    "note that @xmath89 is different from the @xmath73 that was calculated from the corresponding density .",
    "the difference arises because @xmath73 is that potential that reproduces the density given by the le sech wavefunction . on the other hand",
