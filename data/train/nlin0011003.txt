    "according to gazizov @xcite the first publication devoted to approximate symmetries was by baikov et .",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the concept of an approximate symmetry goes back to at least the late seventies  @xcite when the observation was made that , since the differential equations which arise in mathematical modelling are invariably approximate , one should in fact be considering approximate symmetries . the observation may have been a consequence of a number of papers on applications in cosmology in the sixties and seventies ( cf .",
    "these applications continue  @xcite .",
    "more recently in the context of differential equations the concept was regarded as sufficiently important for head  @xcite to add a procedure for the calculation of approximate symmetries to his program lie in  1997 .",
    "the procedure is for computations to the first order in the perturbation parameter  @xmath0 , but the program is easily adapted for the computation to be made to any order ( subject to the capacity of the machine ) .",
    "we recall that a differential equation has a lie symmetry if there exists an infinitesimal transformation which leaves the differential equation unchanged .",
    "the infinitesimal transformation |x = x + , +    parameter , @xmath1 is the independent variable and @xmath2 the dependent variable ( the extension to more than one of each is simple enough in principle ) , can be written as |x = ( 1 + g)x ,    = _ x + _ y. [ 3a ] to deal with differential equations the operator @xmath3 must be extended to give the infinitesimal transformations in the derivatives induced by the infinitesimal transformations in the independent and dependent variables .",
    "the @xmath4th extension of @xmath3 , which deals with all derivatives up to the @xmath4th derivative , is  @xcite g^[n ] = g + _ j=1^n^[j]_y^(j ) , [ 4a ] where ^[k ] = ^[k-1 ] - y^(k ) , k=1,n , + ^[0 ] = .",
    "[ 5a ] an @xmath4th order differential equation , e(x , y , y, ",
    ",y^(n ) ) = 0 , [ 6a ] is invariant under the infinitesimal transformation generated by @xmath3 if g^[n]e_=0 .",
    "[ 7a ] each differential operator @xmath3 , with this property is called a symmetry of the differential equation and the aggregation of all such symmetries forms the lie algebra of the differential equation . a first integral / invariant , @xmath5 , is associated with a symmetry  @xmath3  if g^[n-1]i=0=0 .",
    "[ 8a ] instead of a differential equation one can consider the action integral as the object to maintain its invariance under an infinitesimal transformation . in this case",
    "we have noether s theorem  @xcite which states that @xmath3 is a noether symmetry of a lagrangian , @xmath6 , if there exists a function  @xmath7 , such that f = g^[n ] l +  l. [ 9a ] the existence of the symmetry is independent of the euler  lagrange equation . when the variational principle is invoked to give the euler ",
    "lagrange equations , ( [ 9a ] ) can be manipulated to give the first integral / invariant i = f - .",
    "[ 10a ] all of these considerations have been made without reference to the nature of the coefficient functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in lie s original work on the symmetries of differential equations he considered both point  @xcite and contact transformations  @xcite while noether used generalized transformations _",
    "ab initio_. there is in fact _ a priori _ no restriction on the functional dependence of the coefficient functions and increasingly use is made of generalized and nonlocal symmetries to expand the classes of problems which can be solved .",
    "if algebraic properties are the primary consideration , it is better to stay with point or contact symmetries , otherwise there is no need for constraint . in the end",
    "the choice of type of infinitesimal transformation to be used is determined by a utilitarianism appropriate to the occasion  @xcite .",
    "no matter the type of infinitesimal transformation under consideration , it is always possible to introduce the approximate form of such a transformation if the differential equation under investigation contains a small constant so that the equation can be regarded as a perturbation of the equation with the constant set at zero .",
    "suppose that the differential equation is e(x , y , y, ",
    ",y^(n ) , ) = 0 , [ 11a ] where @xmath0 is the small constant and should not be confused with the @xmath10 used to denote the infinitesimal parameter in ( [ 1a ] ) and ( [ 2a ] ) .",
    "the generator of an approximate infinitesimal transformation of order @xmath11 can be written as g = _ i=0^k^ig_i , [ 12a ] where = 0 .",
    "[ 13a ] the generator ( [ 12a ] ) will be an approximate symmetry of ( [ 11a ] ) if g^[n]e_|_e=0= o(^k+1 ) .",
    "[ 14a ] we note that , when @xmath12 in ( [ 11a ] ) , we have the case of _ a function _ and the definition of an invariant associated with a symmetry group is generalized to that of an approximate invariant or , more correctly , an invariant function of an approximate symmetry group .",
    "( in the language of jet bundles , cf .",
    "cotsakis , leach & pantazi @xcite , one is extending the `` approximate '' vector field from one on the manifold  in the case of a function  to that on the @xmath13 jet bundle of the total space .",

    "however , that theory is limited to the first order in  @xmath0 only and does not lead to the results presented in this paper .",
    "the rest of this paper , which is the third in a series  @xcite devoted to the investigation of the connections between the three main topics in dynamics , _ viz _ symmetry , singularities and integrability , topics which superficially are unrelated in their mathematics and yet are intimately intertwined , is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we examine three simple second order ordinary differential equations for approximate symmetries .",

    "fowler equation of order two considered as a perturbation of the free particle equation .",
    "each of these equations illustrates certain aspects of the properties of approximate symmetries .",
    "we have chosen simple equations so that the properties of the symmetries will not be obscured by complexity of the equations . in   3 we consider the properties of approximate noether symmetries applied to the lagrangians of the differential equations above . in",
    "  4 we examine some of the problems which arise in the determination of approximate first integrals / invariants using the lie method and the approximate symmetries associated with them and in   5 we present our observations and conclusions .",
    "we write the differential equation as + x = 0 , [ 1 ] where @xmath0 is a small parameter .",

    "it is important to note that the knowledge of exact symmetries of a differential equation enables us to reduce it and , if possible , completely solve it to obtain exact solutions .",
    "however , if one seeks for approximate rather than exact solutions , then approximate symmetries are as useful as exact ones and can be determined perturbatively . in this paper",
    "we have emphasized more the study of approximate symmetries rather than approximate solutions .",
