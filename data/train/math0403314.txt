    "for an @xmath4 matrix @xmath5 over the finite field @xmath6 the * weight * of @xmath5 , denoted @xmath7 , is the number of non - zero entries . in the hamming metric on matrices",
    "it is the distance from @xmath5 to @xmath8 .",
    "there is some relationship between the rank and the weight of a matrix .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 , then @xmath10 , and if @xmath11 , then @xmath12 . on the other hand , there are matrices of rank one and maximal weight @xmath13 , such as a matrix with every entry a one . in this article",
    "we determine the average weight of rank @xmath2 matrices in terms of @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 . without fixing the rank ,",
    "the average weight of @xmath4 matrices is @xmath14 and the weight has a binomial distribution .",
    "however , the full probability distribution of the weight for matrices of rank @xmath2 is yet to be determined .",
    "the tools are those of elementary combinatorics and linear algebra .",
    "nothing special is used from the theory of finite fields other than the understanding that the fundamental ideas of linear algebra work over all fields and not just the real or complex numbers .",
    "we need a modest amount of background material .",
    "we use three basic formulas .",
    "the number of ordered @xmath2-tuples of linearly independent vectors in @xmath15is @xmath16    the first vector is any non - zero vector and each succeeding vector must avoid the span of the previous vectors .",
    "the number of @xmath2-dimensional subspaces of @xmath15 is given by the @xmath3-binomial coefficient @xmath17    the numerator is the number of bases of all @xmath2-dimensional subspaces , while the denominator is the number of bases of any given subspace .",
    "the number of @xmath4 matrices of rank @xmath2 is @xmath18    for a fixed @xmath2-dimensional subspace @xmath19 , the number of matrices with @xmath20 as the column space is equal to the number of @xmath21 matrices of rank @xmath2 .",
    "such a matrix is given by the @xmath2 linearly independent row vectors of length @xmath1 .",
    "the number of those is given by formula 1 .",
    "the number of @xmath2-dimensional subspaces of @xmath22 is @xmath23 and the product is the number of rank @xmath2 matrices given in the first line . by the same reasoning , the second line counts the number of @xmath24 matrices of rank @xmath2 , which is the same .",
    "a special case of formula 3 is worth noting .",
    "the number of invertible @xmath25 matrices is @xmath26",
    "the average weight of a rank @xmath2 matrix is the sum of the average weights of the entries , and the average weight of the @xmath27 entry is the probability that the entry is not zero : @xmath28    the probability that @xmath29 for a rank @xmath2 matrix @xmath5 is the same for all @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the probability that the @xmath27 entry is not zero is the quotient whose numerator is the number of matrices @xmath5 of rank @xmath2 with @xmath32 , and whose denominator is the number of matrices of rank @xmath2 .",
    "consider the map on the @xmath33 matrices that switches rows 1 and @xmath30 and switches columns 1 and @xmath31 .",
    "this map preserves rank and gives a bijection between the subset of matrices of rank @xmath2 with a non - zero in the 1,1 location and the subset of matrices of rank @xmath2 with a non - zero in the @xmath34 location .",
    "thus , @xmath35 .",
    "call this common value * the average weight per entry*. now we focus on the upper left corner of the matrices of rank @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis depends on the reduced row echelon form .",
    "we recall the definition @xcite .",
    "a rectangular matrix is in _ row echelon form _ if it has the following three properties :    1 .",
    "all non - zero rows are above any rows of all zeros .",
    "each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it .",
    "all entries in a column below a leading entry are zero .    if a matrix in echelon form satisfies the following additional conditions , then it is in _ reduced row echelon form _ :",
    "the leading entry in each nonzero row is 1 2 .",
    "each leading 1 is the only non - zero entry in its column .",
    "the @xmath21 matrices in reduced row echelon form correspond bijectively with the @xmath2-dimensional subspaces of @xmath15 .",
    "the rows of the matrix give a basis of the corresponding subspace .",
    "when an @xmath36 matrix @xmath5 is reduced to reduced row echelon form by row operations , the result is an @xmath4 matrix whose first @xmath2 rows form a basis of the row space of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the @xmath21 matrix consisting of the @xmath2 non - zero rows of the reduced form",
    ". then @xmath5 and all matrices with the same row space can be constructed from @xmath37 by multiplying @xmath37 on the left by an @xmath38 matrix @xmath39 of rank @xmath2 .",
    "the matrix @xmath39 is unique .",
    "this gives a factorization of @xmath5 as @xmath40 . in terms of the associated linear maps ,",
    "@xmath5 is a linear map from @xmath15 to @xmath22 , which factors into a surjective map onto @xmath41 followed by an injective map from @xmath41 to @xmath22 .",
    "recall that knowing the row space of a matrix is equivalent to knowing the kernel of the associated linear map .",
    "thus , when the reduced matrix @xmath37 is held fixed and @xmath39 is varied , the product @xmath42 gives all maps with the same row space ( i.e. same kernel ) .",
    "for @xmath4 matrices of rank @xmath2 , the average weight per entry is @xmath43    we consider the random selection of a rank @xmath2 matrix such that each such matrix is equally probable . with the factorization @xmath40 ,",
    "this can be done by selecting @xmath39 uniformly from all @xmath44 matrices of rank @xmath2 and by selecting @xmath37 independently from among all reduced row echelon matrices , which is the same as selecting the row space uniformly from all @xmath2-dimensional subspaces of @xmath15 .",
    "the upper left corner of @xmath5 is @xmath45 .",
    "but because @xmath37 is in reduced row echelon form , the first column of @xmath37 is either all zeros or has a leading 1 followed by zeros .",
    "thus , @xmath46 . in order for @xmath47 to be non - zero , both @xmath48 and @xmath49 must be non - zero .",
    "since the selection of @xmath37 is independent of the selection of @xmath39 , @xmath50 the columns of @xmath39 are @xmath2 linearly independent vectors of length @xmath0 and so the first column is not the zero vector .",
    "that means there are @xmath51 possible first column vectors .",
    "there are @xmath52 choices for @xmath53 and @xmath54 choices for the remaining entries of the first column .",
    "therefore , @xmath55",
    "now @xmath56 , and @xmath57 when the row space of @xmath37 contains nothing in the direction of the vector @xmath58 , which is to say that the row space is contained in the @xmath59-dimensional space @xmath60 . therefore , @xmath61 @xmath62 using formula 2 one easily obtains @xmath63 putting these results together we have @xmath64    with this result we have a clear picture of the effect of the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 on the average weight .",
    "the factor @xmath65 is the average weight per entry without the rank condition , in which case the matrix size does not matter .",
    "note that with @xmath0 and @xmath1 fixed , it is more likely for an entry to be non - zero for matrices of larger rank , an intuitively plausible result because both weight and rank are some measure of distance from the zero matrix . also , one can see that as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 simultaneously go to infinity , the probability approaches @xmath66 , which is again the unconditioned probability . for invertible matrices of size @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath67 )",
    "the probability of a non - zero entry is @xmath68",
    "for the matrices of rank one a more complete analysis of the weight distribution is possible . in this case",
    "@xmath39 is a non - zero column vector of length @xmath0 and @xmath37 is a non - zero row vector of length @xmath1 whose leading non - zero entry is 1 .",
    "the rank one matrix @xmath40 is given by @xmath69 , and so the weight of @xmath5 is the product of the weights of @xmath39 and @xmath37 .",
    "the weight of @xmath39 has a binomial distribution conditioned on the weight being positive ( the entries of @xmath39 can not all be zero ) @xmath70 likewise for @xmath37 the weight distribution is given by @xmath71 ( to select a random @xmath37 , choose a random non - zero vector of length @xmath1 and then scale it to make the leading non - zero entry 1 .",
    "the scaling does not change the weight . )",
    "the weight on rank one matrices is the product of these two binomial random variables , each conditioned to be positive .",
    "@xmath72 not all weights between 1 and @xmath13 occur for rank 1 matrices since the weight is a product with one factor no greater than @xmath0 and the other factor no greater than @xmath1 .",
    "plots of actual probability distributions show spikes and gaps .",
    "plots of cumulative distributions are smoother and lead us to expect a limiting normal distribution .",
    "see figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the weight random variable for rank one matrices of size @xmath36 is the product of independent binomial random variables conditioned on being positive .",
    "define @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are independent bernoulli random variables with probability @xmath78 of being 0 .",
    "then @xmath20 is the sum of @xmath0 independent identically distributed random variables @xmath79 .",
    "conditioning @xmath20 on @xmath80 is the weight of rank one matrices . by the central limit",
    "theorem the distribution of @xmath20 converges , as @xmath81 , to a normal distribution after suitable scaling .",
    "now conditioning on @xmath20 being positive does not change this result because the probability that @xmath80 is @xmath82 , which goes to 1 as @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath86 expanding and using the independence of the random variables @xmath87 and the fact that @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we get @xmath90 the variance of the weight is @xmath91 furthermore @xmath92 combining these expressions we get @xmath93 we get a good approximation to the variance of the weight when @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the unconditioned @xmath20 , essentially the factors in the denominator by 1 .",
    "thus , @xmath94 which can be simplified to give @xmath95"
