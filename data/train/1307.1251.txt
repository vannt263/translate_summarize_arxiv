    "recent advances in digital microfluidic ( dmf ) biochips have enabled realizations of a variety of laboratory assays on a tiny chip for automatic and reliable analysis of biochemical samples .",
    "a dmf biochip consists of a patterned 2d array or a customized layout of electrodes , typically a few square centimeters in size @xcite .",
    "the device can manipulate pico- or femtoliter - sized discrete droplets for the purpose of conducting various fluidic operations under electrical actuations .",
    "typical fluidic operations on a droplet include dispensing , transport , mixing , splitting , heating , incubation , and sensing @xcite .",
    "dmf biochips offer significant flexibility and programmability over their continuous - flow counterparts while implementing various assays that mandate high - sensitivity , and low requirement of sample and reagent consumption .",
    "one such example is sample preparation , which plays a pivotal role in biochemical laboratory protocols , e.g. , in polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) @xcite , and in other applications in biomedical engineering and life sciences @xcite .",
    "an important step in sample preparation is dilution , where the objective is to prepare a fluid with a desired concentration ( or dilution ) factor .",
    "there are two performance metrics in sample preparation : the number of _ mix - split _ operations to achieve a concentration factor with a specified accuracy , and the overall reactant usage ( equivalently , waste production ) .",
    "the first parameter determines the sample preparation time , whereas the latter is related to the cost of stock solution .",
    "an efficient sample preparation algorithm should target to minimize either one or both of them as far as possible .    in sample preparation , producing chemical and biomolecular concentration gradients is of particular interest .",
    "dilution gradients play essential roles in in - vitro analysis of many biochemical phenomena including growth of pathogens and selection of drug concentration .",
    "for example , in drug design , it is important to determine the minimum amount of an antibiotic that inhibits the visible growth of bacteria isolate ( defined as minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) ) .",
    "the drug with the least concentration factor ( i.e. , with highest dilution ) that is capable of arresting the growth of bacteria , is considered as mic . during the past decade , a variety of automated bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test systems have been developed , which provide results in only few hours rather than days , compared to traditional overnight procedures @xcite .",
    "typical automated susceptibility methods use an exponential dilution gradient ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) in which concentration factors ( @xmath1 ) of the given sample are in geometric progression @xcite .",
    "linear dilution gradient ( e.g. , @xmath2 ) , in which the concentration factors of the sample appear in arithmetic progression , offers more sensitive tests .",
    "linear gradients are usually prepared by using continuous - flow microfluidic ladder networks @xcite , or by other networks of microchannels @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since the fluidic microchannels are hardwired , continuous - flow based diluters are designed to cater to only a pre - defined gradient , and thus they suffer from inflexibility and non - programmability .",
    "also , these methods require a significant amount of costly stock solutions .",
    "in contrast , on a dmf biochip platform , a set of random dilution factors can be easily prepared . however",
    ", existing algorithms @xcite fail to optimize the cost or performance when a certain gradient pattern is required .    in digital microfluidics ,",
    "two types of dilution methods are used : serial dilution and interpolated dilution @xcite .",
    "a serial dilution consists of a sequence of simple dilution steps to reduce the concentration of a sample .",
    "the source of the dilution sample for each step comes from the diluted sample of the previous step .",
    "a typical serial procedure generates an _ exponential dilution _ profile , in which , a unit volume sample / reagent droplet is mixed with a unit - volume buffer @xmath3 droplet to obtain two unit - volume droplets of half the concentration .",
    "if a @xmath4 sample / reagent is recursively diluted by a buffer solution , then the @xmath1 of the sample / reagent becomes @xmath5 after @xmath6 steps of mixing and balanced splitting . in each _",
    "interpolated dilution _",
    "step , two unit - volume droplets with @xmath1 @xmath7 and @xmath8 are mixed to obtain two droplets with @xmath1 @xmath9 .",
    "both the dilution methods produce concentration factors whose denominators are integral power of two .",
    "thus , in the @xmath10 _ mix - split _ model , the @xmath1 values are approximated ( rounded off ) as an @xmath11-bit binary fraction , i.e. , as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; @xmath15 , determines the required accuracy ( maximum error in @xmath16 ) of the target concentration factor .    in this work ,",
    "we present for the first time , an algorithm to generate any arbitrary linear gradient , on - chip , with minimum wastage , while satisfying a required accuracy in concentration factors .",
    "our algorithm utilizes the underlying combinatorial properties of a linear gradient in order to generate the target set .",
    "the corresponding layout design of the biochip is also proposed .",
    "we prove theoretical results on maximum storage requirement in the layout .",
    "simulation results on different linear gradients show a significant improvement in sample cost over three algorithms @xcite that were used earlier for the generation of multiple concentration factors .",
    "in early days , dilutions were obtained by manually measuring and dispensing solutions with a pipette . with the advent of continuous - flow microfluidic ( cmf ) biochips ,",
    "dilution gradients were prepared based on diffusive mixing of two or more streams .",
    "the degree of diffusion can be regulated by the flow rate or by channel dimensions .",
    "designs of such gradient generators on a cmf biochip were proposed by walker et al . @xcite and oneill et al . @xcite .",
    "the flow rates were adjusted by controlling the channel length , which is proportional to fluidic resistance in each channel .",
    "serial dilution cmf biochips for monotonic and arbitrary gradient were also reported by lee et al .",
    "dertinger et al .",
    "have shown how a complex cmf network of microchannels designed for diffusive mixing can be used to generate linear , parabolic , or periodic dilution gradients @xcite . recently , design of a 2d combinatorial dilution gradient generator has been reported based on a tree - type microchannel structure and an active injection system @xcite .    although continuous - flow devices are found to be adequate for many biochemical applications , they are less suitable for tasks requiring a high degree of flexibility or programmable fluid manipulations .",
    "these closed - channel systems are inherently difficult to integrate or scale because the parameters that govern fluid flow depend on the properties of the entire system .",
    "thus , permanently etched microstructures suffer from limited reconfigurability and poor fault tolerance .",
    "a dmf biochip typically manipulates discrete fluid droplets on a uniform @xmath17d array of identical electrodes .",
    "thus the volume of a merged droplet is usually an integral multiple of that of a single droplet ( unit volume ) .",
    "it is a challenge to achieve a desired concentration factor @xmath18 using the fewest number of _ mix - split _ steps with minimum number of _ waste _ droplets .",
    "a single - target mixing algorithm based on bit - scanning ( _ bs _ ) method was proposed by thies et al .",
    "@xcite considering the @xmath10 mixing model . in the special case of diluting a sample , the _ bs",
    "_ method first represents the target @xmath1 as an @xmath11-bit binary string depending on the required accuracy of @xmath1 ; it then scans the bits from right - to - left to decide on the sequence of _ mix - split _ steps , i.e. , whether the sample or the buffer droplet is to be mixed with the most recently produced droplet . as an example , any path from the root to a leaf node in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsung ] represents an execution sequence of the _ bs _ method .",
    "however , it produces one _ waste _ droplet at each _ mix - split _ step except the last one . in order to achieve a target @xmath1 with a maximum error of @xmath19 ,",
    "the dilution process is to be repeated through at most @xmath11 _ mix - split _ steps .",
    "thus , depending on the required accuracy level of the target concentration , the value of @xmath11 is chosen .",
    "the _ dmrw _",
    "method @xcite generates a single dilution of a sample using a binary search method that reduces the number of _ waste _ droplets significantly compared to the _ bs _ method by reusing the intermediate droplets . recently , a reagent - saving mixing algorithm for preparing multiple target concentrations was proposed by hsieh et al .",
    "for example , the dilution tree for the target set @xmath20 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsung ] , where the a black dot represents an available droplet ( output or waste ) @xcite .",
    "recently , another method for generating droplets with multiple @xmath1s without using any intermediate storage is reported by mitra et al .",
    "based on de bruijn graphs @xcite .",
    "method was generalized for producing multiple @xmath1s with reduced _ mix - split _ and _ waste _ droplets @xcite .",
    "if multiple target droplets with the same @xmath1 are required in a protocol , a dilution engine can be used @xcite .",
    "a reactant minimizing multiple dilution sample preparation algorithm was reported by huang et al .",
    "gradients play essential roles in studying many biochemical phenomena in - vitro , including the growth of pathogens and efficacy of drugs . among various types of dilution profiles ,",
    "linear gradient is most widely used for biochemical analysis .",
    "several sample preparation methods are available that can be used for generating specified gradients .    motivated by an example described by brassard et al .",
    "@xcite , we present an algorithm for producing any arbitrary linear dilution gradient with minimum wastage ( reagent consumption is minimum ) . to illustrate the proposed algorithm we assume that the two boundary concentrations ( first and last @xmath1s of the target sequence ) are available .",
    "if droplets with the two boundary @xmath1s are not supplied , we can prepare them by diluting the original @xmath21 sample with a buffer @xmath3 following an earlier algorithm @xcite , @xcite . a simple observation that motivates us to design the proposed linear gradient generator is the following : mixing two non - consecutive @xmath1s , which are separated by an odd number of elements of the gradient sequence , produces the median of the two concentrations .",
    "this special property follows from the simple fact that the @xmath1 values in the linear gradient sequence are in arithmetic progression .",
    "this property is used to design our algorithm for producing the gradient with no wastage . moreover ,",
    "only the concentrations that are elements of the gradient set will be generated during this process .",
    "the problem of linear dilution sample preparation can be formulated as follows .",
    "let @xmath22 be a linear gradient of targets to be generated from @xmath23 and @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "our objective is to generate all @xmath1 values of @xmath26 without generating any waste droplets ; we assume that a sufficient supply of boundary concentrations ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) is available .",
    "the process of generating the target @xmath1s satisfying a linear dilution gradient can be envisaged as a tree structure called linear dilution tree ( ldt ) , as described below .",
    "return @xmath29    a linear dilution tree ( _ ldt _ ) is a complete binary search tree having @xmath30 nodes , where each node represents a @xmath1 value in the target set @xmath26 , where @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the tree will have a depth of @xmath31 , where the root is assumed to be at depth @xmath32 .",
    "algorithm 1 builds _ ldt _ from the input target set , on which algorithm 2 described below , will be run to produce the droplets in the target set @xmath26 .",

    "<S> digital microfluidic ( dmf ) biochips are now being extensively used to automate several biochemical laboratory protocols such as clinical analysis , point - of - care diagnostics , and polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) . in many biological assays , e.g. , in bacterial susceptibility tests , samples and reagents </S>",
    "<S> are required in multiple concentration ( or dilution ) factors , satisfying certain  gradient \" patterns such as linear , exponential , or parabolic . </S>",
    "<S> dilution gradients are usually prepared with continuous - flow microfluidic devices ; however , they suffer from inflexibility , non - programmability , and from large requirement of costly stock solutions . </S>",
    "<S> dmf biochips , on the other hand , are shown to produce , more efficiently , a set of random dilution factors . however , all existing algorithms fail to optimize the cost or performance when a certain gradient pattern is required . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we present an algorithm to generate any arbitrary linear gradient , on - chip , with minimum wastage , while satisfying a required accuracy in the concentration factor . </S>",
    "<S> we present new theoretical results on the number of _ mix - split _ operations and _ waste _ computation , and prove an upper bound on the storage requirement . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding layout design of the biochip is also proposed . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results on different linear gradients show a significant improvement in sample cost over three earlier algorithms used for the generation of multiple concentrations . </S>"
