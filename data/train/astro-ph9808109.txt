    "observations of co and dust at high redshift are , hence , important for constraining the early evolution of galaxies .    despite considerable observational effort , there are still only a few known high  redshift co sources . these include iras f10214 + 4724 ( brown & vanden bout 1991 ; solomon , downes , & radford 1992 ) , the cloverleaf quasar h1413 + 117 ( barvainis et al . 1994 ) , br1202 - 0725 ( ohta et al . 1996 ; omont et al .",

    ", we report the detection of co(3@xmath02 ) emission in submillimeter source smm023990136 , hereafter smm02399 .",
    "the galaxy smm02399 is the brightest submillimeter source discovered during a survey through rich , lensing clusters ( smail et al . 1997 ) .",
    "follow  up optical work places smm02399 at a redshift of @xmath6 , indicating that the source is gravitationally amplified by the foreground cluster by a factor of 2.5 ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ; hereafter i98 ) .",
    "the optical data show the presence of a bright compact source ( l1 ) containing a narrow  line agn , with an unknown contribution due to star formation , and a diffuse companion ( l2 ) thought to be interacting or merging with l1 ( i98 ) .",
    "the submillimeter data are consistent with thermal dust emission and suggest a massive dust reservoir of order @xmath7 ( i98 ) .",
    "smm02399 was observed using the owens valley millimeter array in two configurations of six 10.4 m telescopes .",
    "a total of 54.7 hours of usable integration time on source was obtained between january 1998 and may 1998 .",
    "the phase center for the radio observations was the position of the brightest optical component of the smm02399 system ( l1 ) ; ra(j2000)=@xmath8 ; dec(j2000)=@xmath9 ( i98 ) .",
    "the co(3@xmath02 ) line was observed using a digital correlator configured with @xmath10  mhz channels .",
    "the receivers were initially tuned to 90.927 ghz , corresponding to co(3@xmath02 ) emission at the optical redshift of @xmath11 .",
    "the co line was placed in the lower side  band ( lsb ) for which the receivers were optimized .",
    "typical lsb system temperatures were approximately 300 k , corrected for telescope losses and the atmosphere .",
    "in addition to the co line data , we recorded the 3 mm continuum data with a 1 ghz bandwidth measured in both the lower and upper side  bands .",
    "the nearby quasar 0238084 was observed every 25 minutes for gain and phase calibration .",
    "absolute flux calibration was determined from observations of uranus and neptune , resulting in a calibration uncertainty of about 15% for smm02399 .",
    "figure 1a shows the co(3@xmath02 ) spectrum for the data taken from 01 january to 17 april ( 38.3 hr ) .",
    "these data suggest that the co emission is centered on a slightly higher redshift ( @xmath12 ) than the optical redshift .",
    "we obtained follow  up observations from 28 april to 21 may ( 16.4 hr ) with the spectrometer shifted to a central frequency of 90.815 ghz in order to obtain a complete profile for the co emission line ( fig .",
    "both data sets were combined to produce the cumulative co(3@xmath02 ) spectrum in figure 1c . to produce the spectra ,",
    "naturally  weighted image cubes were made by averaging the data over independent 24 mhz ( 79 @xmath13 ) channels .",
    "the resulting data cubes were then hanning smoothed , and a continuum level of 0.5 mjy ( i.e. , a dc offset ) was subtracted from the data .",
    "all spectra were taken along the frequency axis of the image cubes at the position of the co emission ( table  1 ) .",
    "although the spectral  line data may suggest a weak continuum level , we lack the sensitivity to detect continuum emission from smm02399 . in the lsb continuum data",
    "we find a flux density of @xmath14 mjy which is consistent with only the co emission averaged over the 1 ghz continuum bandwidth . from the upper  side band continuum data ( line ",
    "free ) , we achieve an upper limit of s(3 mm ) @xmath15 mjy ( @xmath16 ) . for the remaining of the paper ,",
    "we adopt the expected continuum level of 0.3 mjy , derived from extrapolating the previous submillimeter observations of thermal dust emission ( i98 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the naturally  weighted channel maps averaged over independent 112 mhz channels .",
    "as stated earlier , the data were taken at two different frequencies .",
    "the rms noise level is higher for end channels a&e , since these contain less integration time than the central three channels .",
    "we detect co emission at the optical position of smm02399 in channels c&d . by averaging the data in channels c&d ( 224 mhz , 740@xmath13 ) ,",
    "we achieve an 8@xmath17 detection ( fig .",
    "we obtain an integrated flux of @xmath18 and determine the co source position ( table  1 ) by fitting a gaussian to the peak in the integrated map . after subtracting the expected continuum level of 0.3 mjy ,",
    "the resulting co(3@xmath02 ) line flux is @xmath19 . by assuming a lensing amplification factor of 2.5 , the observed co(3@xmath02 ) line flux implies intrinsic line luminosities of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath23 is related to the mass of molecular gas ( including he ) by @xmath24 .",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath25 , which is similar to the galactic value ( e.g. , sanders , scoville , & soifer 1991 ) , and infer a molecular gas mass of @xmath26 . the appropriate value for @xmath27",
    "is uncertain within a factor of 23 .",
    "it has been argued that the galactic value may overestimate the amount of molecular gas in ultraluminous galaxies ( solomon et al .",
    "1997 ) , while other factors such as sub  solar metallicities ( wilson 1995 ) and @xmath28 brightness temperature ratios less than unity ( devereux et al . 1994 ) lead to underestimates of the molecular gas mass .",
    "the co emission seen in figure  2 is unresolved . by varying the ( u , v ) weighting schemes and using deconvolution techniques",
    ", we find an upper  limit for the co source size of @xmath29 .",
    "this angular limit corresponds to a maximum linear diameter of @xmath30 kpc at @xmath1 , or @xmath31 kpc after correcting for lensing .",
    "we can use this limit to constrain the dynamical mass in smm02399 .",
    "the dynamical mass within the co emission regions is @xmath32)^2/g$ ] , where @xmath33 is the observed line width of @xmath34 .",
    "the inclination is unknown .",
    "we find @xmath35 .",
    "these results indicate a gas fraction of @xmath36 , which is consistent with a gas  rich young starburst .",
    "the co emission is positionally coincident with the scuba source smm02399 and the compact optical counterpart ( l1 ) within the uncertainties of the data sets ( fig .",
    "the central frequency of the co emission is slightly redshifted with respect to the mean redshift of the optical lines ( @xmath37 ) , but such offsets have been noted previously for low redshift luminous galaxies ( mirabel & sanders 1988 ) .",
    "these offsets have been interpreted as a signature of outflows in the optically emitting gas where the receding emission is obscured by dust ( mirabel & sanders 1988 ) .",
    "the co emission is unresolved ( @xmath38 ) , unlike the ly@xmath27 emission and the 20 cm radio continuum emission which are @xmath39 in extent ( i98 ) . since it is common for ultraluminous merger systems to be compact co sources ( downes & solomon 1998 ) , it is not surprising that the co emission for smm02399 is unresolved .",
    "in addition , the broad co line , with an apparent double peak profile , is consistent with the suspected merger scenario for the system ( i98 ) .",
    "the derived molecular gas mass of approximately @xmath40 for smm02399 is about 50 times higher than the milky way ( solomon & rivolo 1989 ) and is a few times more massive than the most luminous low redshift infrared galaxies ( sanders et al .",
    "the high molecular gas mass observed in smm02399 is not unique for high  redshift systems .",
    "other high  redshift co sources have similarly large molecular gas masses ( e.g. , guilloteau et al .",
    "1997 ) , and this may indicate evolution in @xmath41 .",
    "such increases are expected in simple theoretical models ( frayer & brown 1997 ) . however , given the uncertainties in @xmath27 ( solomon et al .",
    "1997 ) , the lensing uncertainties , and the small number of high  redshift co sources , the possibility of evolution is only a suggestion at the present time .",
    "we derive a gas to dust ratio of @xmath42700 for smm02399 , assuming a range of dust temperatures of 3070  k. this gas to dust ratio is similar that found for other high  redshift co sources and is also similar to that observed in nearby galaxies ( devereux & young 1990 ) .",
    "this consistency suggests that the high  redshift co sources are already significantly chemically evolved .",
    "based on the deficient co luminosities observed in metal  poor galaxies ( e.g. , sage et al .",
    "1992 ) , the @xmath43 luminosity ratios for the high  redshift co sources are consistent with metallicities of @xmath44 .",
    "the scuba measurements indicate that smm02399 is a hyperluminous infrared galaxy ( hylig , as defined by sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , and the optical data suggest the presence of both a dust  enshrouded agn and starburst activity ( i98 ) .",
    "an important unanswered question is which mechanism is responsible for the majority of its immense infrared luminosity .",
    "the relative importance of agn and starburst activity seen in even the nearest ultraluminous galaxies is still uncertain ( e.g. , scoville , yun , & bryant 1997b ; downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "based on observations using the infrared space observatory , genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that about 25% of ultraluminous galaxies are powered by agns , while the remaining 75% are dominated by star formation .",
    "it is not clear if this trend will hold for the hyligs .",
    "the detection of co in smm02399 suggests the importance of star formation by showing the presence of a massive reservoir of molecular gas from which stars are formed .",
    "other hylig galaxies which do not show co have extremely high @xmath45 ratios and are thought to be dominated by agn activity ( evans et al .",
    "the @xmath45 ratio for smm02399 , on the other hand , is roughly consistent with that found for luminous starbursts ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . after correcting for the lensing of smm02399",
    ", we find a far  infrared ( fir ) luminosity ( helou et al . 1988 ) of @xmath46 and a ratio of @xmath47 .",
    "for comparison , the ultraluminous putative starburst galaxy arp 220 has a @xmath48 ratio which is only about a factor of 2 lower .    the starburst nature of smm02399 is further supported by the far  infrared to 4.85 ghz radio flux ratio parameter @xmath49 ( condon , frayer , & broderick 1991 ) parameter based on the 4.85 ghz radio flux densities instead of the more often cited @xmath49 parameter based on a radio frequency 1.4 ghz , since the radio rest ",
    "frame frequency observed for smm02399 is 5.3 ghz ( i98 ) . ] .",
    "for smm02399 we find @xmath50 which is similar to , but lower than , the mean value of @xmath51 observed in nearby starburst galaxies ( condon et al .",
    "although the data for smm02399 show the importance of star formation , the data also suggest that the agn activity is not negligible . for pure star formation , we would expect a higher @xmath49 value and a lower @xmath52 ratio . in summary ,",
    "the current data are consistent with @xmath53% of the infrared luminosity being powered by star formation , with the remaining fraction due to the agn .",
    "assuming that half of the infrared luminosity of smm02399 is powered by star formation , the implied star formation rate for massive stars is sfr@xmath54 , using the relationship given by condon ( 1992 ) . including low mass stars",
    ", we expect a total sfr of order @xmath55 , depending on the details of the imf .",
    "although high , this sfr is below the maximum allowable rate permitted for the observed co line width ( lehnert & heckman 1996 ) .",
    "we report the first detection of co in a distant galaxy , smm02399 , discovered during the recent deep surveys of the submillimeter sky .",
    "the co emission is coincident in position and redshift with the optical counterpart of smm02399 .",
    "the co observations indicate the presence of @xmath56 of molecular gas .",
    "comparison of the properties of smm02399 with local starbursts suggests that star formation accounts for approximately 2575% of its immense infrared luminosity , with remaining contribution coming from an agn . the derived star ",
    "formation rate is of order @xmath55 .",
    "similar observations of other high  redshift submillimeter sources will test whether the properties of smm02399 are representative of the general faint submillimeter population , as well as placing limits on the contribution of dust  enshrouded agn to the extragalactic submillimeter background .    we thank our colleagues at the owens valley millimeter array who have helped make these observations possible .",
