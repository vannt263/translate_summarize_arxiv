    "galaxy clusters provide important laboratories for studies of galaxy evolution . key aspects of our knowledge concerning the evolution of massive early - type galaxies are derived from the study of rich galaxy clusters at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "cluster studies also provide an important tool for gauging the growth of structure and probing the density of the underlying dark matter and energy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "clusters at @xmath6 provide strong leverage in addressing both issues and thus there is considerable interest in find clusters and groups of galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "a variety of survey techniques have proven effective at identifying galaxy clusters to @xmath8 and beyond .",
    "x - ray selected samples at @xmath9 , while relatively small , sample the most massive and dynamically relaxed systems ( e.g. rosatti et al .",
    "1998 ; stanford et al . 1998 ) .",
    "large area multi - color surveys , such as the red sequence surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) have produced large samples of systems in a range of evolutionary stages .",
    "the mid - ir imaging camera on the spitzer space telescope ( hereafter spitzer ) has extended the range and power of multi - color surveys and a number of programs are producing confirmed and candidate clusters at @xmath9 @xcite . in this short report",
    "we present the discovery of one of the most distant clusters to date .",
    "deep hst and spitzer images of a massive , passively evolving galaxy identified in the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ; @xcite ) has led to the detection of a very compact cluster or group of massive red galaxies at of @xmath0 .",
    "ultra - deep spectroscopy with gemini and deep multi - band photometry has allowed us to obtain a firm redshift for a group of galaxies beyond the reach of most spectroscopic studies .",
    "in  2 we present the observations of the galaxy gdds-12 - 5869 and its surroundings . in section  3 we will discuss the properties of the surrounding galaxies and in section  4 we will briefly discuss the implications for the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . at @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 corresponds to 8.54  kpc .",
    "much of the basic observational data used in this current work has been presented in previous papers related to the gdds . in paper",
    "i @xcite , the visible spectroscopy and supporting optical and near - ir imaging data are described . the optical imaging and early , ground - based near - ir photometry are discussed in more detail in papers describing the parent sample drawn from the las campanas infrared survey @xcite . in gdds paper iv @xcite , we analyzed spectra of passively evolving galaxies with @xmath15 .",
    "one of these objects is gdds-12 - 5869 , a galaxy at @xmath3 with k(vega)@xmath16 and a moderately red color of @xmath17 mag .",
    "our spectrum of this object is shown in fig . 1 of paper iv .",
    "in the classification scheme of paper i , this object has a high confidence redshift and a spectrum consistent with no recent or ongoing star formation .",
    "approximately 60% of the 120 arcmin@xmath18 gdds survey area was imaged with the wide field camera of acs on the hst .",
    "the details of the observations are given in paper viii @xcite .",
    "the 12-hour gdds field was observed for 14,640 seconds in the f814w band ( hereafter @xmath19 ) .",
    "the observations were dithered in non - integer pixel steps and a mosaic was constructed using the standard `` multidrizzle '' package ( koekemoer et al .",
    "the mosaic is @xmath20 in extent , and gdds-12 - 5869 lies @xmath21 from the southern edge of the field .",
    "ten passively evolving galaxies with @xmath22 drawn from the sample in paper iv were observed using nicmos @xcite camera 3 in the f160w band ( hereafter @xmath23 ) .",
    "each field was observed for a total of 3 orbits , and each orbit was split into three dithered exposures .",
    "the images reduced by the hst on - the - fly - reduction ( otfr ) pipeline were retrieved from the data archive , and were corrected for various systematics such as pedestal effects , non - linearity , residual patterns , etc .",
    "these processed images were then combined into mosaics using the iraf `` drizzle '' task that implements the `` drizzle '' algorithm of @xcite .",
    "further details of this data set will be provided in a subsequent paper ( mccarthy et al . in prep ) .",
    "three of the gdds fields were imaged with irac @xcite as part of a guest observer program .",
    "these fields were observed in all four irac channels , and each field was exposed for 10,842 seconds in each channel .",
    "the `` basic calibrated data '' ( bcd ) products of our observations were retrieved from the _ spitzer _ data archive , and were further processed to carefully remove varying backgrounds and residual patterns .",
    "these re - processed images then were combined using the mopex package provided by the _",
    "spitzer _ science center .",
    "in fig . 1 we show the nicmos image of the field around gdds-12 - 5869 .",
    "in addition to the central luminous galaxies , the image reveals a large number of faint galaxies concentrated around them .",
    "the likely cluster members are labeled in order of increasing @xmath23 magnitude . the surface density in a @xmath24 radius circle to a limiting magnitude of @xmath25 ( ab ) in our image is 275  arcmin@xmath26 .",
    "the mean surface density of galaxies to this limit in large area random pointings is @xmath4 60  arcmin@xmath26 ( e.g. yan et al . 1999 ) .",
    "thus the nicmos imaging alone reveals a @xmath27 overdensity in this field .      in figure 2",
    "we present a color image of this field , which dramatically illustrates the compact grouping of very red galaxies in the vicinity of gdds-12 - 5869 .",
    "there are ten or more galaxies with very red optical - to - near - ir and optical - to - mid - ir colors within a circle of 128 kpc ( @xmath28 ) radius as illustrated by the white circle in figure 2 .",
    "as we will show below , these galaxies all have similar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and thus are all likely cluster / group members .",
    "a number of other galaxies with similar colors appear throughout the field , several of which are also consistent with being at the same redshift .",
    "the nature of this group of red galaxies is illuminated by the irac images at longer wavelengths .",
    "the central group of @xmath29 red galaxies are clearly detected in channel 3 ( @xmath30 m ) , and most are also seen in the channel 4 ( @xmath31 m ) .",
    "this clearly shows that they are at high redshift ; the foreground of @xmath32 galaxies drop out of the channel 3 and 4 images as these bands sample rest - frame wavelengths beyond the @xmath33 peak of the sed .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3 where we show the irac channel 3 image along side the r image .    in figure 4",
    ", we show a @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for the area around gdds-12 - 5869 . only galaxies within a 300 kpc ( @xmath36 ) radius of the gdds galaxy",
    "are shown .",
    "the dashed line is the locus of the coma cluster color - magnitude relation @xcite transformed to @xmath3 using a model with a simple stellar population ( ssp ) formed at @xmath37 .",
    "the locus for a non - evolving model is @xmath38 magnitudes redder .",
    "the cmd shows that the most luminous objects , the central four to five galaxies , have colors that lie close to the expected cluster red sequence at @xmath3 .",
    "the bright galaxies in this cmd are at most a few tenths of a magnitude bluer than the pure passive evolution line , suggesting that significant star formation ceased one gyr or more before the epoch of observation .      in order to further determine which galaxies are likely at the same redshift as gdds-12 - 5869 and to constrain their properties , we fit a range of population synthesis models of @xcite to the observed seds of the galaxies in this field .",
    "the seds were constructed using 12-band photometry obtained in ground - based @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath35 , nicmos @xmath23 , and irac channels 1 to 4 .",
    "we adopted a chabrier initial mass function @xcite , and confined ourselves to single components with solar abundance and exponentially declining star formation histories .",
    "the stellar mass , age , star formation time scale , and reddening were left as free parameters .",
    "we first treated the redshift as a free parameter as well , and allowed it to change at a step - size of @xmath45 .",
    "the photometric redshifts ( @xmath46 ) thus derived for the central red galaxies varied somewhat .",
    "two of them ( including gdds-12 - 5869 ) yielded best - fit @xmath47 , consistent with the spectroscopic redshift of gdds-12 - 5869 .",
    "the best - fit @xmath46 values for the others were mixed with some as low as @xmath48 .",
    "nevertheless , a redshift of 1.5 was still among the acceptable solutions for most of these objects .",
    "we then fit each of the bright red galaxies again , but forced the models to be at @xmath49 . for 12 galaxies we obtained best - fits with reduced chi - square ( @xmath50 ) values near unity .",
    "these galaxies are thus considered as candidate cluster members .",
    "table 1 lists their best - fit model parameters obtained at a fixed redshift of @xmath49 , together with their measured properties .",
    "several of the galaxies outside the central @xmath24 radius circle had fits that were significantly worse at @xmath13 than at sufficiently different redshifts ( @xmath51 ) , and thus are unlikely to be cluster members .",
    "the total stellar mass in the 7 well measured galaxies in the central @xmath52 is @xmath53m@xmath54 and all of these appear to be primarily passively evolving objects at the same redshift as the gdds galaxy .",

    "our deep @xmath23 image shows that there are many more faint galaxies in this system than detected in the shallower _ spitzer _ images .",
