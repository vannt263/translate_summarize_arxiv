    "emission lines involving transitions in siii are important diagnostics for astrophysical plasmas , with several intensity ratios being sensitive to temperature and density variations @xcite . over the past 40 years",
    "there have been many calculations of siii transition probabilities and electron impact excitation rates by several authors , which have been subsequently employed in modelling codes to predict theoretical line intensities for different types of plasma .",
    "however , discrepancies between observation and theory found in early studies of the sun and other late - type stars remain unresolved .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated the 3s@xmath23p @xmath2p@xmath33s3p@xmath2 @xmath4p@xmath5 intercombination multiplet at @xmath62335  in the skylab spectra of the sun and international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) observations of several late - type stars .",
    "they noted that , in previous studies , observed line ratios involving these lines lay well outside the range of theoretical values , and indeed beyond the high density limit .",
    "this limit depends on the transition probabilities rather than the collisional rates , and hence @xcite suggested that the discrepancies must be due to errors in the former . although the transition probabilities calculated by dufton et al .",
    "improved agreement between theory and observation , significant discrepancies remained .",
    "similarly , @xcite undertook an observational study of siii emission line intensity ratios in a range of astronomical sources , including the sun , several late - type stars and the slow nova rr telescopii .",
    "in particular , they analysed a high signal - to - noise , high resolution spectrum of @xmath1 tau , obtained with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "these authors once again found discrepancies between theory and observation for line ratios involving the 2335  multiplet , which they attributed in part to blending of the siii lines with niii transitions .",
    "however , they also suggested that the discrepancies may be partly due to errors in the adopted electron impact excitation rates , in contrast to the findings of @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we use recent calculations of atomic data for siii by @xcite in the modelling code cloudy @xcite to analyse emission lines in a representative set of ultraviolet spectra of late - type stars and the sun , to investigate if the discrepancies between theory and observation can be resolved .",
    "specifically , we examine very high quality datasets for three cool stars , @xmath0 geminorum ( @xmath0 gem ) , @xmath1 centauri a ( @xmath1 cen a ) and b ( @xmath1 cen b ) , obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on hst as part of the astral hst large treasury project ( ayres 2013 ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a description of the observations , while section 3 discusses how we have updated the cloudy database with the most recent siii atomic physics calculations . in section 4",
    "we compare the observations with both cloudy simulations and also those generated with chianti , and summarise our conclusions .",
    "the main focus of our study are the three cool stars @xmath0 gem , @xmath1 cen a and b from the astral hst large treasury project @xcite .",
    "this project is aimed at collecting high signal - to - noise , high spectral resolution ultraviolet spectra for a representative sample of late - type ( and subsequently early - type ) stars .",
    "observations were obtained with stis , covering both the fuv ( 11501700 ) and nuv ( 16003100 ) prime grating settings , at a resolution of r = 100,000 , apart from the 17002150  region which is at r = 30,000 . for comparison",
    ", we note that the resolution of the hst / ghrs spectrum of @xmath1 tau analysed by @xcite was only r = 24,000 .",
    "our choice of these stars for the siiianalysis is due to the fact that they show comparatively narrow unblended emission lines , suitable for the accurate determination and investigation of line fluxes .",
    "a detailed description of the astral data processing and calibration may be found in @xcite , while further information on the project is available at its website.ayres/astral/ ]    we also study some previously published siii measurements , namely those for the quiet sun obtained by the hrts experiment during a sounding rocket flight , which recorded the 11851730  solar spectral region on photographic emulsion at a resolution of r @xmath7 30,000 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we re - examine the hst / ghrs spectra of the k5iii star @xmath1 tau , originally analysed by @xcite , which spans the 23202368  region at a resolution of r = 24,000 .",
    "further details of the solar and @xmath1 tau observations may be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in table",
    "[ table : si2 ] we list the siiitransitions investigated , where we note that vacuum wavelengths are employed throughout this paper as the hst data are processed using these to avoid a discontinuity at 2000  between vacuum and air wavelengths . after fitting the local continuum with a polynomial",
    ", we have used a gaussian profile to model the emission lines . in most cases",
    "a gaussian provides a good fit to the emission feature , but in some instances ( particularly shortward of 1800 ) the siii lines show central reversals .",
    "these can arise due to chromospheric absorption from the same star or from the intervening interstellar medium .",
    "in figures [ fig:1260]-[fig:2350 ] we plot portions of the @xmath0 gem spectrum containing siiiemission lines , along with the best - fit gaussian profiles to the observations , to illustrate the quality of the observational data . as noted above , in some instances there are reversals in the line cores , resulting in an intensity dip . in these cases",
    "we fitted the dip in the line profile with an inverted gaussian as well as the standard one to correct for the reduction in line intensity arising from the dip .",
    "the results of the line profile fitting , including measured line wavelengths , widths and intensities , are summarised in tables [ table : beta - gem ] and [ table : alpha ] .",
    "however , for conciseness we only provide wavelengths and widths for @xmath0 gem ( in table 2 ) .",
    "the errors in the line intensities listed in tables 2 and 3 were derived from a monte - carlo simulation of the measurement process given the assigned photometric error , and are hence lower limits to the true uncertainties . in some cases , such as for the siii 2344.92  line in @xmath0 gem , the error may be dominated by systematic uncertainties , for example how to treat local blending . we note that for @xmath1 cen a , intensities are only reported for siiifeatures shortward of 1800 , because the photospheric continuum emission overwhelms weak lines ( including those of siii ) at longer wavelengths .",
    "below we discuss each of the siiimultiplets separately .",
    "* 1260 : ( figure [ fig:1260 ] ) .",
    "there are three emission lines observed in this multiplet ( 1260.42 , 1264.73 , 1265.02 ) , all of which show central reversals and have complex profiles .",
    "the intensity of 1260.42  has been measured by numerical integration of the blue half of the line profile ( which is least affected by central reversal ) , and then doubled to obtain the total line flux . in figure [ fig:1260 ]",
    "we plot the 1260.42  feature fitted with two gaussian profiles , where the negative gaussian models the central reversal .",
    "the lines at 1264.73 and 1265.02  are blended , and we have used two gaussian profiles to model these , with the central reversal in the former fitted using a negative gaussian . * 1304 : ( figure [ fig:1304 ] ) .",
    "both the lines in this multiplet ( 1304.37 , 1309.28 ) are slightly broader than the instrument resolution .",
    "there is a very strong oi line at 1304.87 .",
    "the siiiline at 1309.28  shows prominent central reversal which was modelled using a negative gaussian profile .",
    "* 1526 : ( figure [ fig:1526 ] ) . both the lines in this multiplet ( 1526.70 , 1533.40 ) are broader than the instrument resolution .",
    "* 1808 : ( figure [ fig:1808 ] ) .",
    "the three lines observed in this multiplet ( 1808.01 , 1816.93 , 1817.45 ) are narrow and unblended .",
    "* 2335 : ( figures [ fig:2334 ] and [ fig:2350 ] ) .",
    "there are four observed lines in this multiplet ( 2335.12 , 2335.32 , 2344.92 , 2350.89 ) , with the 2329.23  transition not detected due to its very small a - value and hence predicted intensity .",
    "the siii2335.32  line is blended with niii2335.30 .",
    "however , @xcite note that the niiiline is in fact radiatively pumped by the siiitransition , as fluorescence emission is detected in another niiifeature at 2416.87 . hence ,",
    "as noted by @xcite , the photons observed in the niii2416.87  line must actually be siiiphotons and the intensities of the niiiand siiitransitions need to be added .",
    "furthermore , @xcite pointed out that the pumped niiilevel also gives rise to additional lines at 2084.31 , 2125.79 and 2161.89 .",
    "unfortunately , the spectra analysed by @xcite could not observe these three lines as they were outside the wavelength range of the hst / ghrs observations , and the iue detectors were insensitive at these wavelengths .",
    "these authors hence had to calculate their contribution to the siii2335.32  line flux .",
    "however , the stis spectra for our cool star sample do contain these niiifeatures , along with the 2416.87  line , as may be seen in figures 710 for @xmath0 gem .",
    "their measured wavelengths , widths and intensities are summarised in table 2 for @xmath0 gem , while line intensities are listed for @xmath1 cen b in table 3 . we note that judge et al . calculate the ratio of the total intensity of the three additional niii lines to that of the 2416.87  feature to be 1.1 , while from our stis observations we find this ratio to be 1.1 for @xmath0 gem and 0.48 for @xmath1 cen b.    the resultant siiiline intensity ratios from the @xmath0 gem ,",
    "@xmath1 cen a and b observations are listed in table [ table : ratio1 ] , where we note that the niiiline fluxes have been added to that for siii2335.32  in the determination of the 2335.32/2350.89 ratio . in table [ table : ratio2 ] we provide some additional measurements of siiiline ratios for @xmath1tau from the hst / ghrs observations of @xcite , and hrts quiet sun data from @xcite .",
    "we have undertaken several siiiline intensity ratio calculations using the cloudy modelling code with two sets of atomic data , to investigate the importance of adopting different atomic physics parameters on the theoretical results .",
    "all three cloudy models generated consist of the energetically - lowest 148 fine - structure levels , with the energies taken from the nist database as at 2015 august 8 .",
    "the first atomic model , denoted cloudy1 , employs the experimental a - values of @xcite for the 3s@xmath23p @xmath2p@xmath33s3p@xmath2 @xmath4p@xmath5 intercombination lines , and the calculations of @xcite for the remaining transitions , plus the new siii electron impact effective collision strengths ( ecs ) of @xcite , which are not too different from the ecs data of @xcite adopted in earlier versions of cloudy . in the second atomic model , cloudy2 ,",
    "the a - values for transitions among the lowest 56 fine - structure levels are replaced by the calculations of @xcite , which in many instances show large discrepancies with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated siii line ratios with the chianti atomic database version 7.1.4 , which employs the a - value calculations of tayal ( 2007 ) , nahar ( 1998 ) and nussbaumer ( 1977 ) , plus ecs from @xcite .",
    "the calamai et al . , tayal ( 2008 ) , nahar and aggarwal & keenan atomic data for the siii lines discussed in the present paper are summarised in table 1 for comparison purposes .",
    "the cloudy1 , cloudy2 and chianti models were calculated for optically thin plasma conditions , and hence for completeness we have produced an additional cloudy model , cloudy3 , which uses the same atomic data as cloudy2 but calculates line ratios for an optically thick plasma , specifically a uniform slab with a total hydrogen column density of 10@xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "in table [ table : ratio1 ] we summarise the observed siiiemission line intensity ratios for @xmath0 gem , @xmath1 cen a and b , along with theoretical optically thin values from the chianti , cloudy1 and cloudy2 models calculated at an electron temperature t@xmath10 = 7000k and density n@xmath10 = 10@xmath11@xmath12 , typical of the physical conditions found in the line - forming regions of chromospheres in late - type giant stars @xcite . for the cloudy2 model",
    "we also list theoretical ratios at n@xmath10 = 10@xmath13 and 10@xmath14@xmath12 , to show their sensitivity to the adopted electron density .",
    "( we note that the ratios do not vary significantly with temperature ) .",
    "in addition , results are presented for an optically thick plasma ( cloudy3 model ) to allow the effect of opacity on the results to be assessed , in particular for ratios involving strong allowed lines .",
    "similarly , in table [ table : ratio2 ] we list observed line ratios for @xmath1tau from the hst / ghrs observations of @xcite , plus hrts quiet sun data from @xcite .",
    "in addition we provide chianti , cloudy1 , cloudy2 and cloudy3 model results , calculated at the same plasma parameters for @xmath1tau as for the other cool stars , i.e. t@xmath10 = 7000k and n@xmath10 = 10@xmath11@xmath12 , as the former is also a late - type giant . for the quiet sun",
    "we have generated theoretical ratios at t@xmath10 = 7000k and n@xmath10 = 10@xmath15@xmath12 ( dufton & kingston 1983 ) , but note that the ratios considered in table [ table : ratio2 ] are insensitive to the adopted plasma parameters .",
    "the first point to note from an inspection of tables [ table : ratio1 ] and [ table : ratio2 ] is that the theoretical line ratios from the chianti and cloudy1 models do not in general differ significantly , with discrepancies of typically only 11% .",
    "as the major difference between these models is the adoption of the new @xcite ecs in the cloudy1 calculations , we can state that use of the @xcite data does not significantly change the resultant siii line ratios , at least for those involving the ultraviolet transitions considered in the present paper .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , as the @xcite ecs are in generally good agreement with previous results , as shown in table [ table : si2 ] for the @xcite data .",
    "however , the situation is very different when the new a - value calculations of @xcite are incorporated in plasma models , with the cloudy2 line ratios showing large discrepancies in some instances with the chianti and cloudy1 results . in particular , the 1808.01/1817.45 ratio ( 3s@xmath163p @xmath16p3s3p@xmath16 @xmath16d transitions ) and those involving the intercombination multiplet lines around @xmath62335  ( 3s@xmath163p @xmath16p3s3p@xmath16 @xmath17p ) in the cloudy2 calculations are up to a factor of 7 smaller than the chianti and cloudy1 data .",
    "this is due to the a - values of @xcite for the corresponding transitions similarly being much lower than those of @xcite , by more than an order of magnitude in some cases ( see table 1 ) .",
    "aggarwal & keenan discuss their calculations in great detail , and compare these with previous results .",
    "they estimate their a - values to be generally accurate to @xmath18  20% , although this only applies to strong allowed transitions . for weaker ones , such as the 1808 and 2335  multiplet lines , the errors are likely to be larger and are very difficult to quantify , as discussed by aggarwal & keenan .",
    "it is unclear why there are large discrepancies between the aggarwal & keenan data and the theoretical work of @xcite , and more importantly between the former and the experimental values of @xcite for the 3s@xmath163p @xmath16p@xmath193s3p@xmath16 @xmath17p@xmath20 intercombination lines .",
    "however , we point out that the a - values for the 3s@xmath163p @xmath16p3s3p@xmath16 @xmath16d lines are up to three orders of magnitude smaller than those for the 3s@xmath163p @xmath16p3s3p@xmath16 @xmath16p allowed transitions ( see table 3 of aggarwal & keenan ) . as noted by the referee , since a large part of the matrix element for the 3s@xmath163p @xmath16p@xmath193s3p@xmath16 @xmath17p@xmath20 intercombination transitions arises from fine - structure interactions between the 3s3p@xmath16 @xmath17p@xmath19 and @xmath16d@xmath19 levels , these becomes very sensitive because of the smaller size of the latter .",
    "consequently , the a - values for the 1808 and 2335  multiplets are connected and very difficult to calculate .",
    "we hence strongly recommend further work on the determination of a - values for si ii , and in particular new measurements for the intercombination multiplet .",
    "given the discrepancies between the @xcite results and previous theoretical and experimental data for a - values , it would be understandable to assume that the former must be in error .",
    "however , an inspection of tables [ table : ratio1 ] and [ table : ratio2 ] reveal that the cloudy2 line ratio calculations , which include the @xcite a - values , are in mostly better agreement with the observations than the chianti and cloudy1 results . in particular , the long - standing discrepancies between theory and observation for the intercombination line ratios ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) are removed .",
    "similarly , there is a significant improvement in the agreement between experimental values of the 1808.01/1817.45 line ratio and the theoretical results .",
    "this may be a coincidence , but we believe it is unlikely that the a - values for the components of the 3s@xmath23p @xmath2p@xmath33s3p@xmath2 @xmath4p@xmath5 intercombination multiplet and the 3s@xmath23p @xmath2p@xmath33s3p@xmath2 @xmath2d@xmath5 allowed lines would both be in error by the precise amounts required to provide good agreement between theory and observation , as they are different types of transition , albeit interconnected as noted above .",
    "in addition , the @xcite a - values for other siii transitions are in agreement with previous work , with the resultant cloudy2 ratios similar to those generated by chianti and cloudy1 , which in turn generally agree with the observations .",
    "if the @xcite data were in error , we might expect other transitions to be similarly affected . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xcite results imply that not only are previous calculations in error , but so are the measurements for the siii intercombination lines by @xcite , by up to a factor of 8 , which seems unlikely . as noted above , new experimental determinations of the siii a - values are urgently required to investigate if the previous data are in error . if not , then the discrepancies between theory and observation for the intercombination lines remain , and will need further investigation .    in the cases of the 2329.23/2350.89 and 2335.32/2350.89 ratios in table [ table : ratio2 ] for @xmath1tau , the cloudy2 values are in poorer agreement with observations than the chianti and cloudy1 results .",
    "however , as noted previously the 2335.32  line intensity needs to be added to those for niii features which are pumped by siii emission .",
    "although we have identified and measured line intensities for all four niii transitions in the spectrum of @xmath0 gem and for three of the lines in @xmath1 cen b ( as 2084.31  was not detected in this star , @xcite could only determine the intensity for niii 2416.87  and had to calculate fluxes for the others .",
    "hence their estimate for the 2335.32  line intensity may not be reliable .",
    "similarly , the 2329.23  feature is weak in the hst / ghrs spectrum of @xmath1tau ( it was not detected in the higher quality hst / stis data for the other stars ) and hence may also not be well determined .",
    "we note that although the 1260.42/(1264.73 + 1265.02 ) ratio for the quiet sun in table [ table : ratio2 ] agrees with all the theoretical optically thin values , the cool stars measurements for 1260.42/1264.73 in table [ table : ratio1 ] are somewhat smaller than predicted",
    ". this can not be due to optical depth effects , as the cloudy3 calculation for an optically thick plasma shows an even larger discrepancy with observation .",
    "the most likely explanation for the disagreement would be blending in the 1264.73  line , but a synthetic spectrum generated with chianti reveals no likely candidate . for the other ratios involving allowed lines , the cloudy3 results indicate that at least some of the transitions must be subject to significant opacity , as the observations are in better agreement with these than with the optically thin chianti , cloudy1 and cloudy2 theoretical ratios , one example being 1526.70/1533.40 in the three cool stars plus the quiet sun .    to summarise , siiiline intensity ratios measured from the ultraviolet spectra of cool stars and the sun are found to be in generally good agreement with theoretical results generated with the cloudy modelling code which include the radiative rate calculations of @xcite . in particular , adopting their a - values removes discrepancies previously found between theory and observation for ratios involving the 3s@xmath23p @xmath2p@xmath33s3p@xmath2 @xmath4p@xmath5 intercombination transitions at @xmath62335",
    ". however , these a - values are significantly different ( by up to a factor of 8) from both previous calculations and experimental determinations .",
    "new measurements of the intercombination line a - values are hence urgently required to investigate if the existing experimental data are wrong . if not ,",
    "then the good agreement found between theory and observation in the present paper is simply a coincidence .",
