    "brane - world scenarios @xcite provide a new motivation for studying energy relations associated with gravitational collapse . in these scenarios , instanton transitions @xcite on the brane can be viewed as transport of the topological charge through the brane , much like a change of magnetic flux through a superconducting ring can be viewed as transport of vortices through the ring . in this picture , a @xmath0-vacuum @xcite corresponds to a steady flow of the topological charge into extra dimensions , and preventing such a flow amounts to a solution to the strong cp problem . the simplest mechanism that can achieve that is an energy cost @xcite .",
    "indeed , while in the 4-dimensional chromodynamics instantons connect states that are exactly degenerate in energy ( a consequence of the symmetry with respect to the `` large '' gauge transformations @xcite ) , in the presence of extra dimensions that need not be so @xcite .    in one version of the scenario , energy accumulates in an extra - dimensional black hole @xcite . however , it is not clear from the outset what is the appropriate definition of energy in this case .",
    "should we be talking about the usual mass of a black hole , as defined by the spatial asymptotics of the metric , or is there a different `` free energy '' associated with late stages of gravitational collapse ?",
    "evolution of a quantum state on the brane is determined by @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the action of matter and gravity ( including those in the bulk ) .",
    "based on this , in the present work , we explore properties of the following quantity f(t ) = - , [ f ] i.e. , minus the lagrangian computed on the collapsing solution . in a brane - world scenario , there is a preferred time coordinate  the proper time of an observer on the brane , and it is this time that we use in the definition ( [ f ] ) .",
    "we consider evolution of an instanton `` particle '' in the 5-dimensional ( 5d ) @xmath3 yang - mills ( ym ) theory coupled to gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "although this asymptotically flat case is not a realistic braneworld ( gravity and the gauge field are not localized on the brane ) , the question about time - dependence of @xmath4 can still be asked ; by a `` brane '' in this case we mean a sphere at large radius .",
    "note that the derivative in ( [ f ] ) is a full derivative , rather than a partial one taken at fixed endpoint values of the canonical coordinates ; the partial derivative would give us the mass @xmath5 of the black hole .",
    "we refer to @xmath4 as the free energy ( of a classical black hole ) , for the following reason .",
    "suppose at late times @xmath6 becomes a constant , i.e. , the action becomes a linear function of time .",
    "such a function can be analytically continued to the euclidean time @xmath7 , so that the euclidean action is @xmath8 .",
    "since we are dealing with just a single classical trajectory , the partition sum reduces to @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the hawking temperature @xcite ) , which means that @xmath4 is the free energy .",
    "interpretation of the euclidean lagrangian as a thermodynamic potential is known in the literature @xcite , and , as we will see , our result agrees with the corresponding thermal expression , eq .",
    "( [ thermo ] ) below .",
    "however , this agreement is by no means obvious a priori : the thermal result is obtained by considering the stationary vacuum exterior alone , while our result corresponds to a time - dependent metric of collapsing matter . moreover , during collapse , @xmath6 is expected to change , and a priori it is not even clear if it will approach _ any _ constant value at late times .",
    "the latter point , however , can be checked directly in the case of spherical symmetry , when collapse can be simulated numerically . in this paper , we present results of such a simulation .",
    "gravitational instability of an initially static instanton particle in the 5d pure ym theory follows directly from the classical scale invariance of the corresponding 4d theory and had been discussed previously @xcite . here",
    ", we discuss the process of gravitational collapse of such objects ( we have considered both static and nonstatic initial configurations ) .",
    "we observe formation of a black hole ( of some energy @xmath5 ) and find that soon after that @xmath4 reaches a nearly constant value @xmath11 .",
    "we interpret the factor @xmath12 as follows . for a 5d schwarzschild black hole , the hawking temperature , computed by the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the gravitational radius : r_0 ^ 2= g_5 e , [ r_0 ] and @xmath15 is 5d newton s constant ( our choice of the radial coordinate @xmath16 will become apparent shortly ) .",
    "the entropy @xcite is @xmath17 .",
    "then , by standard thermodynamics , the free energy is f_thermo = e - st = e .",
    "[ thermo ] note that , while @xmath10 and @xmath18 each contain a power of the planck constant @xmath19 , the product @xmath20 does not and so has a finite classical limit .",
    "we see that the value ( [ thermo ] ) agrees with the value of @xmath4 reached in the course of our classical simulation .    for the schwarzschild exterior alone , eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) would give @xmath21 .",
    "we find that the difference @xmath22 comes from a thin shell near the horizon .",
    "it may seem , then , that @xmath4 being nearly constant at large times is simply a consequence of the slowing down ( redshift ) of the near - horizon dynamics as seen by a distant observer . if the near - horizon evolution were to stop entirely , however , we would again have @xmath21 .",
    "( this relation holds for any static configuration , vacuum or not ) .",
    "this not being the case means that the fields continue to change , and their time dependence significantly contributes to @xmath4 .",
    "the situation is similar to ordinary statistical equilibrium : macroscopically nothing changes , but there is still motion on the microscopic scale .    in the remainder of the paper , we describe various technical details of our approach .",
    "we conclude with some comments on the quantum behavior of the system .",
    "we use the isotropic coordinates , in which a spherically - symmetric metric takes the form [ isometric ] ds^2 = -n^2(t , r ) d t^2 + ^2(t , r)(d r^2 + r^2 d _ 3 ^ 2 ) .",
    "these are convenient for numerical studies of gravitational collapse because of the absence of singularities in the metric functions : formation of a black hole is reflected in vanishing of the lapse function @xmath23 at some point , while the conformal factor @xmath24 remains finite everywhere .",
    "this observation was used previously in ref .",
    "@xcite for studying the evolution of metric perturbations after inflation .",
    "the 5d schwarzschild geometry in the isotropic coordinates has the form [ schwarziso ] ds^2= - d t^2 + ( 1 + ) ^2 ( d r^2 + r^2 d _ 3 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath14 is the gravitational radius .",
    "note that @xmath24 does not stay finite in the `` white - hole '' region of this geometry  there is a singularity at @xmath25 .",
    "we find , however , that , while the exterior metric of black holes that we obtain numerically well matches the @xmath26 region of the metric ( [ schwarziso ] ) , the interiors are quite different , and in our case @xmath24 stays finite .    when the metric is asymptotically flat , the total energy ( adm mass @xcite ) of the spacetime is = - r^3 . _",
    "r |_r = r , [ etot ] where @xmath27 is some large radius . in the limit @xmath28",
    ", @xmath29 will be conserved .",
    "one should keep in mind , though , that , for a general initial state , only part of the mass will collapse to form a black hole , while the rest will be radiated away in the form of matter waves . the expression ( [ etot ] ) is the total and does not , in general , coincide with the mass @xmath5 of the black hole .",
    "related to the isotropic coordinates are cartesian coordinates @xmath30 , @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 . in these",
    "cartesian coordinates , our ansatz for the @xmath3 gauge field is [ gaugeansatz ] a_^a = ( 0 , ^a_ijn_j ) , where @xmath33 ; @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is the unit radial vector , @xmath36 are the thooft symbols @xcite , and @xmath37 is the dynamical variable .",
    "note that @xmath38 at all times , which is consistent with the equations of motion .    for a gauge field of the form ( [ gaugeansatz ] ) , the topological charge q=- d^4 x ^ijklf^a _  ijf^a _  kl ( @xmath39 is the field strength ) becomes q=- f(f-2)f dr = - ( f^3 - 3f^2 ) dr .",
    "so , any configuration that interpolates between @xmath40 at @xmath25 and @xmath41 at large @xmath16 has unit topological charge .",
    "an example is the bpst instanton @xcite , [ selfdual ] f_0(r ) = , where @xmath42 is an arbitrary scale parameter .",
    "the part of the einstein - ym equations that are evolution equations can be written in the hamiltonian form [ eom1 ] & = & , + [ eom2 ] & = & f++f - , + [ eom3 ] & = & - , + & = & + 43 ^2 - 8v -4(+2r ) -4(+1r ) .",
    "[ eom4 ] here @xmath43 , dots and primes denote temporal and spatial derivatives , respectively , v= , and [ gaugeenergy ] = ( 12 + 12 f^2 + v ) .",
    "@xmath44 can be thought of as a potential for the gauge field , and @xmath45 as the field s energy density .",
    "the instanton ( [ selfdual ] ) is then a `` kink '' , which interpolates between two degenerate minima of @xmath44 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we see that @xmath46 ( the trace of the extrinsic curvature ) and @xmath47 can be regarded as conjugate momenta of @xmath24 and @xmath48 .",
    "the lapse function @xmath23 , on the other hand , has zero conjugate momentum , i.e. , it is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "the einstein equation for it is an ordinary differential equation that has to be solved at each moment of time [ eqn ] ( )  + 2() = ( + 2 f^2 - 4v ) .",
    "the remaining einstein equations are constraints : the energy constraint [ energyconstr ] -3 = ^2 - k^2 , where @xmath49 is the flat - space laplacian , and the momentum constraint [ momentumconstr ] 14 k = pf . if these are satisfied at the initial time slice , the evolution equations together with eq .",
    "( [ eqn ] ) ensure that they are satisfied at all times .    eqs .",
    "( [ eom2 ] ) and ( [ eom4 ] ) require boundary conditions at @xmath50 .",
    "we choose [ bcr ] k(t , r ) = p(t , r ) = 0 .",
    "although this does not automatically enforce the momentum constraint ( [ momentumconstr ] ) at @xmath50 , for a large enough @xmath27 the constraint holds there to a sufficient accuracy .",
    "regularity of the gauge field at @xmath25 implies that @xmath51 and @xmath52 at all times . using these in the momentum constraint ( [ momentumconstr ] ) , we find [ bc0 ] k(t , 0 ) = f(t , 0 ) = 0 . together with eq .",
    "( [ bcr ] ) , this provides enough boundary conditions for the evolution equations .",
    "we still need boundary conditions for eq .",
    "( [ eqn ] ) . the metric ansatz ( [ isometric ] ) leaves us the freedom of a global ( @xmath16-independent ) redefinition of time .",
    "we use this freedom to set @xmath53 . if the boundary is far away from any matter , @xmath23 at large @xmath16 is close to its newtonian limit , for which [ newt ] n(t , r ) = - . for large enough @xmath27 ,",
    "the difference of this from zero is inessential , and the data presented here have been obtained with [ bcn ] n(t , r ) = 0 .    finally , we list a convenient integrated form of the energy constraint = 2 ^ 2 _ 0^r ( - k^2 ) ^3 r^3 dr .",
    "[ eneint ] the constraints are not involved in the evolution algorithm but are used to monitor the accuracy of the simulation .",

    "f^a ) + i_b , [ iorig ] where @xmath54 is the boundary term chosen so as to remove the second derivatives of the metric functions @xcite .",
    "just as we did for the energy , we need to distinguish between the total action ( [ iorig ] ) and the part of it , which we call @xmath2 , that corresponds to the black hole alone .",
    "this is possible at sufficiently late times , when the black hole and the outgoing radiation become well separated .",
    "when computed on our spherically - symmetric ansatz , the total action becomes = dt _ 0^r dr l , [ itot ] where & l= & ( -12 + 6^2nr^3 + 6nr^3 ) + & & - n r(6f^2 -6 + 12v ) .",
    "[ l ] a _ static _ configuration is one for which @xmath55 and @xmath56 at a given instant vanish . for any such configuration",
    ", one can integrate by parts the term with @xmath57 in ( [ itot ] ) and use the energy constraint ( [ energyconstr ] ) to bring the lagrangian to the form = r^3 .",
    "n  |_r = r .",
    "[ lstatic ] in the asymptotically flat case , @xmath23 and @xmath24 approach unity at large @xmath16 , and the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lstatic ] ) becomes minus the energy ( [ etot ] ) .",
    "this is an expected result .",
    "indeed , for static configurations the total and partial derivatives of the action coincide , so the lagrangian equals minus the hamiltonian .",
    "in general , an initial state is an arbitrary solution of the constraints ( [ energyconstr ] ) and ( [ momentumconstr ] ) .",
    "one class of such states are static states , for which the momenta vanish identically , so the momentum constraint is trivially satisfied .",
    "to solve the energy constraint for such states , we pick a function @xmath58 for which gravity is weak and solve the constraint equation - ^2 = ( f^2 + v ) [ ec_static ] by a formal expansion in the parameter @xmath59 .",
    "the actual expansion parameter is @xmath60 , where @xmath42 is the spatial size of the configuration .",
    "for example , if @xmath58 is taken to be the instanton ( [ selfdual ] ) , the first three terms in the expansion are = 1 + -+  .",
    "[ psi ] retaining a sufficient number of terms allows us to solve the constraint to any required accuracy .    using a large static instanton as the initial condition offers certain advantages for numerical work .",
    "these are related to the fact that such an instanton is nearly a classical solution ( it is destabilized only by gravity , which for large @xmath42 is weak ) .",
    "we find that in this case collapse generates relatively little of an outgoing wave , and the total action @xmath61 nearly coincides with the action of the black hole , @xmath62 .",
    "this simplifies the measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "[ in general , @xmath2 has to be obtained by integrating over @xmath16 in ( [ itot ] ) not from @xmath63 to @xmath27 but from @xmath63 to some intermediate radius , so that the outgoing wave is left out . ]",
    "initial stages of the collapse of an instanton with a large @xmath42 can be studied analytically , since at large @xmath42 the system is in the newtonian limit .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eom1])([eom2 ] ) in this limit combine into = f  + + f - . [ eqf ] we search for a solution in the form f(t , r ) = + ^2 h_1(r , ) + h_2(r , ) .",
    "[ solf ] this describes the slow motion of the instanton size ( `` modulus '' ) @xmath42 , together with small deformations of the instanton shape that this motion causes .",
    "now , in terms of the parameter @xmath64 introduced above , @xmath65 is @xmath66 , while @xmath67 is @xmath68 .",

    "[ fig : stot ] shows where the free energy is accumulated .",
    "the growth from @xmath94 to @xmath92 in the region outside the horizon is the contribution to @xmath95 from the static schwarzschild exterior and , as expected , closely matches the energy of the black hole .",
    "note that while an outgoing wave with a crest at @xmath96 is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f ] , it practically does not contribute to @xmath95 .",

    "the counting of powers of @xmath19 , described in the introduction , shows that , unlike the temperature or entropy , the free energy of a black hole remains finite in the classical limit and so may have a purely classical interpretation .",

    "( [ f ] ) . at present , our evidence for this is purely numerical and confined to a specific type of black hole in a specific 5d theory .",

    "we conclude with a remark on the quantum theory of the system described by the action ( [ itot ] ) . in spherical symmetry ,",
    "quantization of gravity is straightforward : gravity has no independent degrees of freedom and simply follows quantized matter . as we have seen , in the newtonian limit , gravitational collapse of an instanton is described by the ordinary differential equation ( [ eql ] ) for the modulus @xmath42 .",
