    "disorder , in the form of quenched impurities in a sample , is likely to modify various measurements .",
    "however , from a theoretical point of view , characterizing the behavior of disordered systems has proven difficult , making this one of the most challenging and controversial fields of statistical mechanics .",
    "the directed polymer in a random medium ( dprm ) is one of the rare cases of a disorder - dominated system whose statistical properties can be determined in great detail both analytically and numerically @xcite , and thus serves as a prototype for other such systems .",
    "furthermore , its behavior is related to a plethora of other problems in statistical mechanics , such as the kinetic roughening of surfaces @xcite , the hydrodynamics of the burger s equations @xcite , and surprisingly the biological sequence - alignment problem for genes and proteins @xcite .",
    "the dprm is directly relevant to vortex lines in superconductors with point impurities .",
    "most research on the vortex phases in these systems has focused on the structural properties of the flux lattice in a sample containing many vortices .",
    "recently , the statistics of single vortex lines was studied experimentally on a two dimensional flux line lattice oriented parallel to a thin micrometer - sized film of 2h - nbse@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "magnetic response measurements show interesting sample dependent fine structure in the constitutive relation @xmath1 , providing a fingerprint of the underlying random pinning landscape .",
    "more generally , the random potential is expected to modify the measurement of various thermodynamic and structural quantities , making it desirable to characterize the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the outcome . at one extreme ,",
    "microscopic quantities such as two - point correlation functions are quite sensitive to randomness , inducing in some cases complicated multiscaling behavior of their pdfs @xcite . on the other hand , the free energy and other macroscopic quantities are expected to have simpler self - averaging behavior , while non - trivial finite - size effects are still present in their corresponding pdfs .    to date",
    ", the pdf of the free energy is known exactly only for a single line , the dprm @xcite . however , as in superconductors , in most cases elastic lines appear at a finite density , leading to novel effects resulting from a competition between randomness and line interactions .",
    "similar line lattice structures occur in domain walls in the incommensurate phase of charge - density - waves , in monolayers adsorbed on crystal surfaces , and in the form of steps on the vicinal surface of a crystal @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by de gennes in the context of polymers @xcite , and later on by pokrovsky and talapov for domain walls in incommensurate phases @xcite , the statistical mechanics of a _ pure _ two - dimensional line lattice maps onto one - dimensional free fermions if the repulsive line interactions are replaced by non - crossing constraints .",
    "applying the same constraint , kardar used the replica method to show that the line lattice in a random potential maps onto one - dimensional @xmath2 fermions with an attractive interaction @xcite . calculating the ground state energy of this quantum system for integer @xmath3 by bethe ansatz , and analytically continuing to @xmath4 , the quench - averaged free energy was calculated in this reference .",
    "although the pdf was not calculated explicitly , a scaling ansatz for the replica free energy was proposed based on dimensional arguments .",
    "following up on this mapping , there have been attempts @xcite to calculate the density correlations of the line lattice from the excitation spectrum of the @xmath2 fermions by bethe ansatz , leading to different results .    in this paper",
    "we examine the analogy between the replicated line lattice and @xmath2 fermions further .",
    "a considerable difficulty in the replica approach is the need for analytical continuation to small @xmath3 of the results obtained for integer @xmath3 .",
    "analyticity is usually assumed in replica theories , since it can not be proved in most cases .",
    "here we develop a new method for analytical continuation in the line lattice problem which is based on euler s gamma function , the natural continuation of the factorial to real valued arguments .",
    "this technique provides an analytic expression for the replica free energy of the line lattice at small @xmath3 in terms of an integral equation , which in general has to be solved numerically .",
    "interestingly , in the dilute limit of the line lattice , the analytically continued bethe ansatz equations are identical to that of the 1d bose gas with delta - function repulsions .",
    "this novel mapping allows us to obtain exact expressions for the free energy cumulants of the line lattice , and to reveal new relations between density correlations in the 1d bose gas and the replica theory of the line lattice , respectively .",
    "the scaling predictions for the replica free energy proposed in @xcite , and used in @xcite in a wider context of disordered systems , are strikingly confirmed .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . using the replica method and the analogy between elastic lines and world - line of quantum particles ,",
    "we first show that the random line system is described by a quantum problem of `` colored '' fermions , which interact upon contact .",
    "this analogy is explained in detail in section 2 .",
    "exact solutions for the ground state energy of this colored fermion model in the thermodynamic limit are then obtained via the series of nested bethe anstze introduced by yang @xcite . for an integer number @xmath3 of colors ,",
    "the resulting sets of bethe ansatz equations can be reduced to a single set of equations by considering @xmath3-clusters of fermions , as showed by takahashi @xcite and kardar @xcite .",
    "these integer @xmath3 equations are derived in subsection 3.1 . in the following subsection 3.2",
    ", we develop a new technique to continue the discrete bethe ansatz equations directly to continuous @xmath3 .",
    "we find that for small @xmath3 , and in the limit of low line density , the complex @xmath3-color fermion problem can be mapped onto the well - studied one - dimensional bose gas with delta - function repulsions @xcite ( see section 4 ) .",
    "it turns out that the bose gas interaction strength is proportional to the number @xmath3 of replicas , thus mapping the interesting regime @xmath5 into the weak coupling limit of the bose gas .",
    "therefore , the problem of calculating disorder averaged cumulants of the free energy of the line system becomes equivalent to a perturbative expansion of the ground state energy of the one - dimensional bose gas in the weak coupling limit .",
    "the exact results for the cumulants of the free energy are presented in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 we apply our novel mapping to the question of what can be learned about the density - density correlation function of the line lattice from the known results for corresponding correlation functions of the 1d bose gas .",
    "configurations of directed elastic lines can be regarded as the world lines of quantum particles , where the coordinate along the line plays the role of time . to develop a concrete picture of this analogy",
    ", we consider the canonical partition sum @xmath6 of a @xmath7 dimensional lattice of @xmath8 interacting lines in a random environment of lateral length @xmath9 . to simplify the sum over all configurations of the lines ,",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions in the direction parallel to the lines .",
    "this is justified since the statistical mechanics of the line lattice is insensitive to the particular choice of boundary conditions in the limit where @xmath9 is much larger then the spacing between line collisions @xcite .",

    "but there is an additional restriction for the configurations of elastic lines compared to the boson world lines .",

    "this attraction can be understood as follows . in the original random system",
    "the lines prefer to wander through regions of favorable values of the random potential @xmath15 .",

    "the explicit distinction between lines in the same or different replicas has disappeared from the hamiltonian , but is hidden in the required transformation properties of the wave function under particle permutations .",

    "( ii ) @xmath52 must be _ symmetric _ if two of the @xmath3 _ different _ replica ( colored ) particles corresponding to the same line are exchanged since replicas are equivalent .",
    "due to its antisymmetry , @xmath52 tends to zero if two particles of the same color approach each other and the attractive delta - function potential becomes inactive .",
    "this guarantees automatically that the impurity averaging results effectively in an attractive interaction on contact between particles of _ different _ color only .",
