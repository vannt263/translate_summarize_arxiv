    "the main goal of the heavy - ion collision ( hic ) program is to understand strong force and extended systems governed by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "developments over the last two decades allowed the creation and investigation of new forms of qcd matter characterized by high parton densities .",
    "one major achievement in hic was the discovery that qcd matter at energy densities greater than 1 gev/@xmath2 acts like a strongly interacting plasma of quarks and gluons .",
    "indeed , the fast ( local ) thermalization time and the good agreement of the data at rhic with ideal relativistic hydrodynamics models ( which admit a fluid evolution with zero viscosity ) are evidences that the matter formed at rhic is a strongly interacting plasma of quarks and gluons @xcite , as confirmed by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) data @xcite .    since in hic the expansion of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is accepted to be a hydrodynamic expansion of an ideal fluid , it will nearly follow trajectories of constant entropy , the so - called isentropes . due to the conservation of the baryon number ,",
    "the isentropic trajectories are lines of constant entropy per baryon ( @xmath3 ) in the ( @xmath4 ) space with zero strange quark density , @xmath5 , which contain important information on the adiabatic evolution of the system . for ags , sps , and rhic the values of @xmath3 are 30 , 45 , and 300 , respectively @xcite .",
    "lattice results for the isentropic ( 2 + 1 ) flavors equation of state ( eos ) at these values of @xmath3 are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed that the presence of a critical end point ( cep ) in the qcd phase diagram deforms the trajectories describing the evolution of the expanding fireball .",
    "this will have important consequences on the search for the cep , because modifications of the expansion trajectory may lead to observable effects in the hadron spectra ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the possible existence of the cep and its implications to the qcd phase diagram is a very timely topic that has drawn the attention of the physics community . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the location of the cep has been intensively investigated by using lattice qcd calculations ( despite the fermion sign problem , extrapolation methods have been used to access the region of small chemical potentials and look for the cep @xcite ) , and more recently by using dyson - schwinger equations @xcite . also , effective models such as the nambu@xmath0jona - lasinio ( njl ) model and its extensions , like the njl model with eight - quark interactions and the polyakov@xmath0nambu@xmath0jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model , have been used to study critical properties around the cep @xcite .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", the location of the cep is one major goal of several hic programs , but so far , no definitive results have been found about its location , and even its existence remains a mystery .",
    "since 2010 , the beam energy scan ( bes - i ) program at rhic has been searching for the experimental signatures of the first - order phase transition and the cep by colliding au ions at several energies @xcite . in the near future it is expected that , if the cep exists at a baryonic chemical potential below 400 mev , the upcoming bes - ii program can provide data on fluctuation and flow observables which should yield quantitative evidence for the presence of the cep . also , at rhic , the star collaboration is looking for the cep , but no definitive conclusions were possible from their measurements of the moments of net - charge multiplicity distributions .",
    "future measurements with high statistics data will be needed @xcite .",
    "the na49 program at cern sps has also investigated the cep s location in nuclear collisions at 158@xmath6 gev by analyzing @xmath7 pairs with an invariant mass very close to the two - pion threshold , looking for critical fluctuations of the sigma component in a hadronic medium @xcite .",
    "sizable effects of @xmath8 pair fluctuations with critical characteristics were found in si + si collisions , but these effects could not be directly related to the presence of the cep .",
    "presently , the na61/shine program is dedicated to looking for the cep and investigating the properties of the onset of deconfinement in light and heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "recently , new possible hints on the cep were given :    * in @xcite a finite - size scaling analysis of non - monotonic excitation functions for the gaussian emission source radii difference obtained from two - pion interferometry measurements in au+au ( @xmath9 gev ) and pb+pb ( @xmath10 tev ) collisions suggests a second order phase transition with the estimated location of the cep at @xmath11 mev and @xmath12 mev ; * in @xcite it was observed a sharp peak in the trace - anomaly and a local minimum of the generalized specific volume at a laboratory energy of 11.6 agev which can provide a signal for the formation of a mixed phase between the quark - gluon plasma and the hadron phase ; * in @xcite it is argued that the observed collapse of directed flow of protons and pions at mid - rapidity at 9 gev @xmath13 gev is the evidence for the softening of the qcd equation of state ( eos ) , possibly caused by a first - order phase transition .",
    "if these results are confirmed , i.e. , an unambiguous experimental identification of a first - order phase transition from the hadronic phase to the deconfined phase , and having in mind that lattice qcd calculations at zero baryon chemical potential show an analytic crossover for the transition from hadrons to quarks and gluons @xcite , the existence of the cep gains a strong foothold .    as a matter of fact",
    ", it might be easier to detect the first - order phase - coexistence region than the cep : when the expanding matter created in a hic eventually crosses a first - order phase transition line the system probably will spend sufficient time in this region to develop measurable signals .",
    "possible observables of this transition are based on the clumping of the system due to spinodal phase decomposition .",
    "this could lead to enhanced fluctuations of observables like the strangeness : the enhancement of the kaon - to - pion fluctuations can be the result of the enhancement of fluctuations in the strangeness sector ( for a review , see ref .",
    "these fluctuations caused by spinodal instabilities are a generic phenomenon of first - order phase transitions and may be less suppressed by the short lifetime and the finite size of the system , as compared to critical fluctuations needed to detect the cep .",
    "the experience acquired in theoretical and experimental investigations concerning the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition can be very useful to the study of deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in relativistic hic @xcite .",
    "indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spinodal instabilities as a signal of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition have been successfully identified in nuclear multifragmentation .    in the next several years ,",
    "planned experiments at fair ( gsi ) and at nica ( jinr ) will strengthen the search for the cep ( and the first - order transition of the qcd phase diagram ) by exploring regions of higher baryonic chemical potentials , and definitive conclusions concerning its possible existence and location are expected ( a review on the experimental search of the cep can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is also important to point out that the location of the cep is affected by several conditions like the isospin or strangeness content of the medium @xcite , the role of the vector interaction in the medium @xcite or the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the possible location of the cep will allow us to set stricter constraints on effective models .",
    "considering all that has been mentioned above , together with its relevance for the understanding of the qcd phase diagram , in the present work we investigate the isentropic trajectories crossing the chiral phase transition around the cep in both the crossover and first - order transition regions .",
    "we consider different scenarios of interest for the phase diagram obtained by choosing different values of the isospin and the strangeness chemical potentials .",
    "finally , we explore the effects of the vector interaction and of an external magnetic field on the isentropic trajectories around the cep .",
    "to investigate quark matter subject to strong magnetic fields , we will use the pnjl model @xcite with 2 + 1 flavors and a vector interaction .",

    "other potentials were proposed in literature ( see for example ref .",
    "however , a new and consistent polyakov - loop potential fitted to the latest lattice data that are continuum extrapolated and cover a large temperature range is needed .",

    "we next analyze how the isentropic trajectories near the cep are affected by the influence of a repulsive vector interaction and by the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "we start with the case where the vector coupling is absent at zero magnetic field and use the results as benchmarks to discuss the effects of the vector interaction and of the presence of a magnetic field on the isentropes .",
    "we will neglect the effect of the soft - mode fluctuations around the cep .",

    "_ case _ ii@xmath0 equal @xmath70 and @xmath71 quark chemical potentials ( @xmath72 ) and zero strange quark chemical potential ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "it corresponds to zero charge ( isospin ) chemical potential , @xmath74 , and the strangeness chemical potential is one third of the total baryonic chemical potential , @xmath75 .",
    "this is the relevant scenario to simulate matter created by ultra relativistic hic . indeed , since thermalization is reached within @xmath76 sec ( 10 - 20 fm / c ) , the time scale of the strong interaction , the system is far from @xmath1-equilibrium .",
    "the net strange quark number should be zero before the beginning of hadronization in the expansion stage @xcite so , the strange quark density must be set to zero , @xmath77 .",
    "iii@xmath0 @xmath1-equilibrium matter corresponding to @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "next , we present our results for isentropic trajectories close to the cep . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we plot the isentropic trajectories in the @xmath81 ( left panel ) and in the @xmath82 ( right panel ) planes for _ case _ i. the cep is located at ( @xmath83 155 mev , @xmath84 291 mev ) ( see table [ table : cep ] ) . at zero temperature ,",
    "the phase diagram presents a first - order phase transition with @xmath85 mev being the critical chemical potential where the transition takes place @xcite . at @xmath86 , both chiral and deconfinement",
    "transitions are crossovers , being the respective pseudocritical temperatures at @xmath87 mev and @xmath88 mev @xcite .",
    ".temperature , quark chemical potential and baryonic density for the cep in the different scenarios considered ( @xmath89 @xmath90 ) .",
    "[ table : cep ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to investigate the influence of the magnetic field on the behavior of isentropic trajectories we take @xmath91 gev@xmath92 , a relatively small magnetic field , and @xmath93 gev@xmath92 ( a magnetic field that could occur at lhc experiments , even if the magnetic field can only be produced for a short period of time in hic ) , which are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] , respectively .",
    "no imc effects on the location of cep will be considered . from the panels of both figures ,",
    "we conclude that as the magnetic field increases , the spinodal region is enlarged , especially for @xmath94 gev@xmath95 : the extension of the spinodal region at @xmath96 goes from @xmath97 mev for @xmath98 to @xmath99 mev for @xmath94 gev@xmath95 .",
    "a complete study of the effect of the magnetic field intensities on the eos at @xmath96 was performed in refs .",
    "as pointed out , for some ranges of the magnetic field , several first - order phase transitions occur which disappear when the temperature is slightly increased , so they will not influence the behavior of the chosen isentropic trajectories .",
    "in fact , like in our case for @xmath100 gev@xmath95 , the filling of the landau levels originates haas  van alphen oscillations ( the effect of landau quantization of charged particles energy ) .",
    "larger values of @xmath22 increase the amplitude of the fluctuations and reduce their number , because fewer landau levels are involved @xcite .",
    "the consequence is that the larger the intensity of the magnetic field , the greater the difficulty in restoring chiral symmetry . on the other hand , by increasing the temperature , thermal energy can become of the order of the level spacing and washes out these landau quantization effects .",
    "nevertheless , at sufficiently low temperatures , landau quantization still manifests itself by the appearance of oscillations in physical quantities like the pressure .",
    "the investigated isentropic trajectories are quite affected by the growth of the spinodal region as would be expected : there is an entrainment of the isentropes to higher temperatures within this region as it grows , due to the increasing of the magnetic field , as can be seen by comparing the left panels of figs .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] .",
    "together with the shift of the cep ( see table [ table : cep_eb ] ) to higher ( lower ) temperatures ( chemical potentials ) by increasing magnetic fields ( making the spinodal region bigger ) , also the isentropic trajectories are pushed to higher temperatures in the transition region , especially when @xmath93 gev@xmath95 .    however , outside of the spinodal region and for high chemical potentials , the isentropes have almost the same temperature as those with @xmath98 , in particular for @xmath91 gev@xmath95 .",
    "this can be understood by considering the fact that at high temperatures and chemical potentials , the restoration of chiral symmetry already took place and the magnetic catalysis effect is almost suppressed : due to the increasing temperature , more landau levels will be filled , when compared with low temperatures , being the system less affected by the magnetic field . for lower temperatures isentropes with @xmath101 , at @xmath94 gev@xmath95 , are more affected by the magnetic field ( as can be seen in left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) , where they can decrease as @xmath102 is increased .    as in the previous sections ,",
    "no focusing of isentropic trajectories towards the cep is seen with increased magnetic field but only smooth trajectories , as with the results obtained in the model su ( 2 ) .    finally , from the right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] , it is seen that the baryonic density area of the transition region increases as the magnetic field increases .",
    "this is the result of the strengthening of the first - order transition due to the magnetic field .",
    "as already mentioned , stronger magnetic fields induce larger spacing between the landau levels , and consequently , it is more difficult to restore chiral symmetry . on the other hand , for high magnetic fields",
    ", the lower - density spinodal line is pulled to very small densities , and some isentropes ( see the case for @xmath103 in the right panel of fig . [ fig:5 ] ) can reach the spinodal region for small values of the density . with this behavior",
    ", it is expected that the enhancement of fluctuations of observables caused by spinodal instabilities , like strangeness , will be more easily detected in the presence of strong magnetic fields .",
    "in the present work we have investigated the isentropic trajectories around the cep .",
    "the isentropic trajectories are very interesting because the hydrodynamical expansion of a hic fireball nearly follows trajectories of constant entropy .",
    "new insights about the qcd phase diagram can be obtained by investigating these possible paths for the hydrodynamic evolution of a thermal medium created in the collisions .",
    "an unambiguous experimental identification of a first - order phase transition ( if it exists ) from the hadronic phase to the deconfined phase is one important goal of hic experiments at present and future facilities .",
    "however , the first - order transition can be affected by the isospin or strangeness content of the medium , by the role of the vector interaction in the medium , or by external conditions , like the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "we considered different scenarios of interest for the phase diagram by choosing matter with different content of strangeness and isospin ( the @xmath1-equilibrium case having the largest isospin asymmetry ) .",
    "we also explored the effects of the vector interaction and of an external magnetic field on the isentropic trajectories around the cep .",
    "more asymmetric matter weakens the first - order transition : the cep for matter in @xmath1-equilibrium occurs at lower temperatures and densities than the symmetric cases ( @xmath104 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) ; at @xmath96 the spinodal region is also smaller for matter in @xmath1-equilibrium .",
    "concerning the isentropic trajectories , the behavior is qualitatively similar for all cases investigated , but for the same values of @xmath3 , the isentropic trajectories occur at lower temperatures for matter in @xmath1-equilibrium .    when a vector interaction is introduced , the first - order transition becomes even weaker , which is reflected in the cep location ( it can even disappear in the @xmath102 axis ) and in an increasingly smaller area of instability as @xmath105 grows . in the high chemical potential region",
    "the isentropic trajectories behave similarly to the case without vector interaction once the chiral symmetry is already restored for all scenarios and the influence of vector interaction fades out .    on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of a strong magnetic field on the phase diagram is reflected in the strengthening of the first - order transition with the respective enlargement of the spinodal region and the displacement of the cep to higher temperatures and lower chemical potentials .",
    "the isentropic trajectories are entrained for higher temperatures , and the ones with lower values of @xmath3 at lower temperatures are more affected by the magnetic field , especially for higher values of @xmath22 . for high magnetic fields ,",
    "the lower - density spinodal line is pulled to small densities , and some isentropes can reach the spinodal region for small values of the density .",
    "it is then expected that there will be an enhancement of fluctuations of observables caused by spinodal instabilities in the presence of strong magnetic fields at lower densities .",
