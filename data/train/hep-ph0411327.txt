    "hence , it is necessary to eliminate the dependence of @xmath69 on one of these parameters . here in the present work ,",
    "we eliminate @xmath100 dependence of @xmath69 by performing integration over @xmath100 in the kinematically allowed region .",
    "the averaging of @xmath69 over @xmath100 is defined as [ e6826 ] p_ij = the reason why we study the dependence of @xmath101 on new wilson coefficients is that in doing so we directly establish new physics beyond the sm , if the value of @xmath101 turns out to be different compared to that predicted by the sm .    in figs .",
    "( 1)(8 ) we present the dependence of the averaged double ",
    "lepton polarization asymmetries on the new wilson coefficients . from these figures",
    "we get the following results :    * @xmath102 exhibits very strong dependence on scalar , tensor interactions as well as on the vector interaction with coefficient @xmath103 .",
    "when scalar interaction coefficients vary in the region @xmath104 the value of @xmath102 is positive ; in the region @xmath105 it gets negative value and when it varies in the region @xmath106 it again gets positive values . we should remind that in the sm @xmath102 is negative and its magnitude is @xmath107 .",
    "similar situation holds for tensor interaction with the coefficient @xmath29 , as can easily be seen in fig .",
    "our analysis shows that @xmath108 depends more strongly on scalar and tensor interactions , as is the case for @xmath102 .",
    "therefore we can conclude that measurement of the sign and magnitude of @xmath109 and @xmath108 can give essential information about the existence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "* @xmath110 is very sensitive to the existence of the scaler interaction only . more essential than that",
    ", @xmath110 changes its sign when scalar interaction coefficients vary in the allowed region .",
    "such behavior can serve as a good test for establishing new type of scalar interaction .",
    "* @xmath111 , and both are quite sensitive to the existence of tensor and scalar interactions , and to the vector interaction with coefficient @xmath23 . in the presence of tensor , scalar and vector interactions the values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 can exceed the sm results 6 , 5 and 2.5 times , respectively .",
    "moreover , when scalar interaction coefficients @xmath114 is negative , then the value of @xmath112 is positive ( negative ) .",
    "when @xmath114 is positive , @xmath112 becomes negative ( positive ) .",
    "for the case when vector interaction coefficient @xmath23 is negative , @xmath112 is also negative , while , when @xmath23 changes sign and becomes positive , @xmath112 turns out to be positive as well .",
    "therefore determination of the sign and magnitude of @xmath115 and @xmath112 can give unambiguous information about the existence of scalar and vector interactions .",
    "departure of @xmath116 and @xmath117 from sm results is of not considerable importance , and hence we do not present their dependence on @xmath13 .    depicted in figs .",
    "( 4)(7 ) are the dependence of @xmath101 on the new wilson coefficients for the @xmath118 decay . similar to the @xmath119 decay",
    ", we observe that several of the double  lepton polarization asymmetries are very sensitive to the existence of new physics .",
    "more precisely , we can briefly summarize the results as follows :    \\i ) except @xmath22 , @xmath102 is very sensitive to the existence of all new wilson coefficients .",
    "\\ii ) @xmath108 and @xmath110 exhibit strong dependence on all wilson coefficients , except the vector interactions @xmath22 and @xmath120 .",
    "these quantities show very strong dependence , especially , on all types of scalar interactions , vector interactions with coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath103 , and tensor interaction with coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "\\iii ) @xmath121 are very sensitive to the existence of scalar interactions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , when these coefficients are both positive . more important than that ,",
    "@xmath122 change their sign when scalar coefficients vary in the region @xmath123 .",
    "\\iv ) @xmath124 are both strongly dependent only on the tensor interaction with coefficient @xmath29 . for all other new",
    "wilson coefficients the values of @xmath125 are very close to the sm prediction , i.e. , to zero . furthermore ,",
    "when @xmath29 is negative ( positive ) , these quantities get positive ( negative ) values , with a considerable departure from the sm about @xmath126 . therefore",
    ", determination of the sign and and magnitude of @xmath127 and @xmath128 can give direct information solely about the existence of the tensor interaction .",
    "\\v ) similar situation holds for the double  lepton polarization asymmetry @xmath129 as well , i.e. , @xmath129 shows strong dependence only on the tensor interaction with coefficient @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath29 is negative ( positive ) , @xmath129 gets negative ( positive ) values .",
    "hence , departure from the sm prediction ( in sm @xmath130 ) can reach to @xmath131 .",
    "therefore analysis of @xmath132 can serve as a good test for establishing the presence of tensor interactions .",
    "the values of @xmath133 is negligibly small ( maximum departure from the sm is being about @xmath134 ) and for this reason we do not present its dependence on @xmath13 .    at the end of this section ,",
    "let us discuss the possibility of measurement of the lepton polarization asymmetries in experiments .",
    "experimentally , to measure an asymmetry @xmath135 of the decay with the branching ratio @xmath136 at @xmath137 level , the required number of events ( i.e. , the number of @xmath138 pair ) are determined by the following expression =  , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the efficiencies of the leptons .",
    "efficiency of the @xmath141 lepton is practically equal to one , and typical values of the efficiency of the @xmath142 lepton ranges from @xmath143 to @xmath144 for the various decay modes @xcite .    from the expression for @xmath145",
    "we see that , in order to obtain the double  lepton polarization asymmetries in @xmath8 decays at @xmath146 level , the minimum number of required events are ( for the efficiency of @xmath142lepton we take @xmath147 ) :    * for the @xmath119 decay = \\ { + ll ~10 ^ 9 & p_ll  , + ~7 10 ^ 10 & p_tt  , + ~3 10 ^ 10 & p_nn p_lt p_tl  , + . which yields that , for detecting @xmath129 , @xmath133 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , more than @xmath148 @xmath149 pairs are required . * for @xmath118 decay = \\ { + ll ~10 ^ 10 & p_ll , p_tt ,  p_nn  , + ~310 ^ 11 & p_lt = p_tl  , + > 10 ^ 13 & p_ln , p_nl , p_tn , p_nt  . + .",
    "the number of @xmath149 pairs that will be produced at lhc is around @xmath150 . as a result of a comparison of this number of @xmath149 pairs with that of @xmath145",
    ", we conclude that @xmath109 , @xmath112 , @xmath128 , @xmath110 and @xmath151 in @xmath119 decay , and @xmath152 , @xmath112 and @xmath128 in @xmath118 decay can be detectable in future experiments at lhc .",
    "note that for calculation of the branching ratio , we take its sm result , i.e. , @xmath153 and @xmath154 . in obtaining these values , minimal value for the photon energy",
    "is taken to be @xmath155 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we calculate nine double  lepton polarization asymmetries using the most general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian including all possible form of interactions .",
    "the sensitivity of the averaged double  lepton polarization asymmetries to the new wilson coefficients are studied .",
