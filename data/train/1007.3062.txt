    "there have been a number of recent studies concerned with spin wave mode structure @xcite and linewidths @xcite in the in - plane magnetized configuration for such dipole coupled arrays .",
    "there have also been experimental studies conducted for disc arrays in the perpendicularly magnetized state , with characterization achieved by cavity ferromagnetic resonance @xcite ( cavity fmr ) and magnetic resonance force microscopy @xcite ( mrfm ) .",
    "the mode structure in the perpendicularly magnetized geometry can be modelled more easily than in the tangentially magnetized case , because of the cylindrical symmetry of the disc in the axial direction .    in the cited studies of perpendicularly magnetized arrays",
    "the measured spin wave spectra matched well with theoretical predictions , but due to the experimental techniques used this comparison could only take place over limited frequency ranges .",
    "in addition , only in one of the studies was there an investigation into the effect of array packing on the fmr mode structure . in ref . ,",
    "variation of the pitch along one direction of the square array was found to affect the absolute field positions of the peaks in the spectrum , but not the relative field positions of individual peaks . additionally , none of the studies cited deal with the effect of array packing density on the fmr linewidth in the perpendicularly magnetized geometry .    in this study ,",
    "vector network analyzer fmr ( vna - fmr ) was used to study the perpendicularly magnetized spin wave mode structure and linewidth of a series of four disc array samples with varying degrees of array ordering , over a wide range of excitation frequencies .",
    "these arrays have been previously studied in the tangentially magnetized state , and details of their production and characterization can be found in ref . .",
    "each of the four array samples consisted of a locally trigonal array of permalloy discs , with each array distinguished from the others by a different degree of long - range ordering .",
    "the long - range ordering was quantified with a parameter @xmath0 , the average amount of variation in the lattice angle in degrees per millimeter .",

    "all discs had thickness @xmath3 nm . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the same arrays magnetized in the plane of the substrate , the intrinsic damping parameter @xmath4 extracted from equation [ silvafwhmeqn ] has been observed to be slightly higher for patterned films than for unpatterned films , but uncorrelated to array ordering .",
    "@xcite it is not clear whether the assumption that the inhomogeneous damping @xmath5 is independent of field and frequency holds in such patterned systems , that is , it is not clear that equation [ silvafwhmeqn ] holds .",
    "if it does not , then the fitted value of @xmath4 and the real value of the intrinsic damping parameter may be different .",
    "furthermore , it must be acknowledged that the uncertainties accompanying the linear increases in figure [ alphavsphi ] are large , especially for the second radial mode .",
    "the value of @xmath4 in the patterned films appears to be unrelated to the value from the parent continuous films , perhaps because of the differing mode structures .",
    "however , no convincing explanation as to why @xmath4 should increase with increasing array disorder can be conjectured at this time .",

    "the standing spin wave mode structure and linewidth broadening in a series of trigonal sub - micron diameter disc arrays in the perpendicularly magnetized state was investigated using vector network analyzer ferromagnetic resonance .",
    "comparison to theory of measurements over a wide range of frequencies allowed deviations of the mode structure from that of an isolated disc to be identified .",
    "these deviations revealed the importance of array ordering to the absolute size of the demagnetizing factors .",
    "deviations from expected frequency differences between modes suggested that the standing spin wave modes were influenced by dynamic dipole coupling between discs .",
    "the relative values of demagnetizing fields for successive modes were essentially unaffected by changes to the array symmetry , and the relative mode structure was consequently unaffected by increasing disorder in the the arrays .",
    "anomalously large linewidth broadenings were observed close to the out - of - plane demagnetizing fields of the arrays , and conjectured to be caused by differing local magnetization directions due to dipole coupling between disordered discs . at sufficiently high applied fields ,",
    "the linewidth increased linearly with excitation frequency , with a gradient that increased with increasing array disorder .",
    "the physical origins of these changes to the as - fitted intrinsic damping parameter in both this perpendicularly magnetized geometry and those already reported for the tangentially magnetized geometry @xcite remain unknown .",
    "it is thus unclear whether these phenomena are related .",
    "there appears to be a common conclusion from the ferromagnetic resonance studies of the close - packed trigonal disc arrays in both magnetization geometries : that linewidth is affected by the lack of preservation of the long - range symmetry of the array , but resonance frequency is not . since it is known that increasing the diameter - to - pitch ratio of a square array of discs affects the in - plane magnetized resonance field , @xcite this in turn suggests that the changes in ferromagnetic linewidth resonance observed in this study were the product of changes in the array symmetry itself , rather than of the slightly lower packing fractions that come as a consequence of that reduction in symmetry .",
