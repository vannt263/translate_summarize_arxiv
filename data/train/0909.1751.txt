    "bose condensates of atoms with nonzero total spin @xmath2 show various phases combining magnetic and superfluid order . when the magnetic symmetry is broken spontaneously , as can occur when the atoms are confined in a spin - independent optical trap , condensates are classified as `` polar '' ( for antiferromagnetic interactions ) or `` ferromagnetic '' .",
    "most theoretical studies of these spinor bose condensates neglect the long - range interaction between atomic magnetic moments , and this neglect is justified for many experimental conditions .",
    "however , recent experiments  @xcite investigating ordering in a nearly two - dimensional condensate have shown complex magnetic behavior in the ferromagnetically interacting @xmath3 spinor bose gas of @xmath0rb .",
    "the most surprising feature of these experiments , which image the spin distribution in real space , is a long - lived phase that appears to have the broken global @xmath1 invariance of a superfluid along with possible breaking of the continuous translational symmetry in one or two directions , i.e. , with stripe - like or checkerboard - like order .",
    "a possible supersolid phase has recently also been suggested in the superfluid of @xmath4he .",
    "@xcite many theoretical papers have been written about the properties of @xmath4he and whether a supersolid phase can exist in the absence of disorder .",
    "only recently have theoretical studies been done to explain the observed supersolid - like behavior in a @xmath0rb spinor condensate .",
    "@xcite the earlier studies of @xmath0rb concentrated on magnetic properties arising from the weak spin - dependent local interaction and the quadratic zeeman shift .",
    "more recent experiments  @xcite indicates that the long range dipole interaction also plays an important role in the formation of the magnetic phases in spatially large systems and with this addition a supersolid state might be possible . +   + most previous studies of this system concern dynamical properties : the leading instability when the hamiltonian is changed to favor ferromagnetic order can be stripe - like or checkerboard - like depending on parameters .",
    "@xcite in this paper , our goal is to determine the static ground - state phase diagram .",
    "we start from the phases that are well established at low temperatures  @xcite for a spin-1 gas with no dipole interaction and quadratic zeeman effect .",
    "( low temperatures mean below the superfluid and magnetic transitions , where all the studies in this paper will take place . ) we then add the dipole interaction to see how it changes the phases as well as the location of the boundary between them .",
    "we do this in a quasi - two - dimensional geometry as in the experiments .",
    "@xcite we investigate both an infinite and a finite square planar geometry . after observing the formation of two kinds of stripe order in a monte carlo simulation",
    ", we developed an analytical approach to explain the results , based upon smallness of the dipolar coupling at short distances .",
    "that analytical approach is presented first in order to prepare the groundwork for the simulation results .",
    "we show that all boundaries in the phase diagram , except between the two polar phases , are moved when the dipole interaction is added , some in a non - intuitive way .",
    "the magnetic dipole interaction prefers a ferromagnetic state , but the confinement makes a ferromagnetic state out of the plane energetically unfavorable .",
    "moreover , the spin precession make the in - plane perpendicular ferromagnetic state unfavorable , since the spin rotates out of the plane .",
    "both ferromagnetic phases can get modulated in one direction .",
    "the phase parallel to the external fields needs a strong dipole interaction or a system much wider than its length to become modulated .",
    "this modulation appears as fully magnetized stripes with sharp domain walls between them .",
    "the phase perpendicular to the external fields gets modulated , from the very lowest dipole strengths , into a helical configuration around the field .",
    "the wavelength of the helix is inversely proportional to the dipole strength . for @xmath0rb",
    "the wavelength is @xmath5 and should be observable in experiments .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "in the following section , we review the basic physics of spinor condensates without the dipole interaction . in section iii",
    "we introduce the dipole interaction and put it into a form that is convenient for numerical simulations .",
    "section iv presents analytical results in the limit of weak dipole interaction , and section v contains the results of our monte carlo simulations of the problem .",
    "the final section summarizes the relationship between our results and those of other theoretical papers and suggests how future experiments could be designed to observe clearly the metastable supersolid phase found in our simulations .",

    "the length scale in the experiment is smaller than the pitch of the helical modulation we describe above by a factor 10 , roughly , for typical parameters .",
    "cherng and demler  @xcite find a dynamical instability at a scale nearer that seen in experiment .",
    "that picture would suggest that even if the phase diagram obtained here describes the system at long times , the experimental system might instead reach a long - lived metastable state . as explained in section v above ,",
    "while we do see metastable states in some parts of the phase diagram , we do not see metastable checkerboard states in the region probed by current experiments , but this could be because the metropolis dynamics of our simulation is not the actual dynamics of the condensate , even if their thermodynamics are the same .",
    "one challenge for this dynamical scenario is that in experiments , an imposed helical configuration with pitch @xmath210  @xcite quickly evolves into a state modulated at a smaller scale , again roughly ten times smaller than the stable , or at least metastable , supersolid state we predict .",
    "@xcite this suggests that effects we have not taken into account prevent the current experimental system from finding this minimum . as an example",
    ", it is known that the dipole interaction makes the larmor precession unstable , according to lamacraft  @xcite ; as a result , the larmor - averaged energy that is the main focus of the present work might not be an accurate description for long times .    in order to observe the predicted supersolid clearly , our results suggest that the key is to suppress this larmor instability while at the same time preserving the conservation of total magnetization in the field direction .",
    "the larmor instability  @xcite grows exponentially from thermal excitation of an initial perturbation at the larmor frequency @xmath211 .",
    "hence the time scale to reach a fixed final size of the instability is proportional to @xmath212 and can be increased either by increasing the magnetic field or decreasing the temperature . at the same time , an experiment should be designed to preserve the magnetization along the field direction for as long as possible , which requires a high degree of trap uniformity .",
    "one motivation for continued exploration of this system is that our results show that the larmor - averaged system does have a supersolid ground state for a wide range of parameters .",
    "_ note added _ : as this work was being prepared for submission , two e - prints appeared investigating the same experiment by slightly different approaches .",
    "@xcite the first , by j.  zhang and t .- l .  ho , also investigates the static properties of @xmath0rb using a deterministic numerical method and also gets the @xmath98 state and a modulated @xmath213 state .",
    "the main difference between their results and ours appears to be that they find a stripe phase rather than a helix for the phase with spins perpendicular to the applied magnetic field .",
    "they find arrays of elliptical and hyperbolic mermin - ho vortices , as a meta - stable dynamical state , between the stripes for the @xmath98 state for all q. however , they are smaller than the spin healing length and hence unobservable in our simulation , although we do see them close to the transition to the @xmath214 state . the second",

    "we need the dimensionally reduced form of the coulomb part expressed in a rotating frame . ignoring the contact term in @xmath219 and performing two partial integrations we find    @xmath220[\\partial_{y ' } \\rho(y')]}{|{\\mathbf}{x}-{\\mathbf}{x}'|}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath221 is an effective surface charge density .",
