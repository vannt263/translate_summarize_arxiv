    "security is an important issue in wireless systems due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions . in a pioneering work ,",
    "wyner in @xcite addressed the security problem from an information - theoretic point of view and considered a wire - tap channel model .",
    "he proved that secure transmission of confidential messages to a destination in the presence of a degraded wire - tapper can be achieved , and he established the secrecy capacity which is defined as the highest rate of reliable communication from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver while keeping the wire - tapper completely ignorant of the transmitted messages .",
    "recently , there has been numerous studies addressing information theoretic security .",
    "for instance , the impact of fading has been investigated in @xcite , where it has been shown that a non - zero secrecy capacity can be achieved even when the eavesdropper channel is better than the main channel on average .",
    "the secrecy capacity region of the fading broadcast channel with confidential messages and associated optimal power control policies have been identified in @xcite , where it is shown that the transmitter allocates more power as the strength of the main channel increases with respect to that of the eavesdropper channel .",
    "in addition to security issues , providing acceptable performance and quality is vital to many applications .",
    "for instance , voice over ip ( voip ) and interactive - video ( e.g , .",
    "videoconferencing ) systems are required to satisfy certain buffer or delay constraints . in this paper",
    ", we consider statistical qos constraints in the form of limitations on the buffer length , and incorporate the concept of effective capacity @xcite , which can be seen as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given time - varying service process can support while satisfying statistical qos guarantees .",
    "the analysis and application of effective capacity in various settings have attracted much interest recently ( see e.g. , @xcite@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we define the _ effective secure throughput _ as the maximum constant arrival rate that can be supported while keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of these messages in the presence of qos constraints .",
    "we assume that the csi of the main channel is available at the transmitter side .",
    "then , we derive the optimal power control policies that maximize the effective secure throughput under different assumptions on the availability of the csi of the eavesdropper channel . through this analysis",
    ", we find that due to the introduction of qos constraints , the transmitter can not reserve its power for times at which the main channel is much stronger than the eavesdropper channel .",
    "also , we note that the csi of the eavesdropper provides little help when qos constraints become more stringent .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly describes the system model and the necessary preliminaries on statistical qos constraints and effective capacity . in section iii",
    ", we present our results for both full and only main csi scenarios .",
    "finally , section iv concludes the paper .",
    "the system model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : systemmodel ] .",
    "it is assumed that the transmitter generates data sequences which are divided into frames of duration @xmath0 .",
    "these data frames are initially stored in the buffer before they are transmitted over the wireless channel .",

    "the additive gaussian noise samples @xmath17\\}$ ] are assumed to form an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) sequence .",
    "we denote the average transmitted signal to noise ratio with respect to receiver 1 as @xmath18 .",
    "we also denote @xmath19 $ ] as the instantaneous transmit power in the @xmath2th frame .",
    "now , the instantaneous transmitted snr level for receiver 1 can be expressed as @xmath20=\\frac{p[i]}{n_1 b}$ ] .",
    "then , the average power constraint is equivalent to the average snr constraint @xmath21\\}\\le { { \\text{\\footnotesize{snr}}}}$ ] for receiver 1 . if we denote the ratio between the noise power of the two channels as @xmath22 , the instantaneous transmitted snr level for receiver 2 becomes @xmath23=\\gamma\\mu^1[i]$ ] .      in @xcite , wu and",
    "negi defined the effective capacity as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given service process can support in order to guarantee a statistical qos requirement specified by the qos exponent @xmath24 .",
    "if we define @xmath25 as the stationary queue length , then @xmath24 is the decay rate of the tail of the distribution of the queue length @xmath25 : @xmath26 therefore , for large @xmath27 , we have the following approximation for the buffer violation probability : @xmath28 .",
    "hence , while larger @xmath24 corresponds to more strict qos constraints , smaller @xmath24 implies looser qos guarantees .",
    "similarly , if @xmath29 denotes the steady - state delay experienced in the buffer , then @xmath30 for large @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is determined by the arrival and service processes @xcite .",

    "we define the effective capacity obtained when the service rate is confined by the secrecy capacity as the _ effective secure throughput_.    in this paper , in order to simplify the analysis while considering general fading distributions , we assume that the fading coefficients stay constant over the frame duration @xmath0 and vary independently for each frame and each user . in this scenario ,",

    "( [ eq : effectivedefirate ] ) is obtained using the fact that instantaneous rates @xmath41\\}$ ] vary independently over different frames . the _ effective secure throughput",
    "_ normalized by bandwidth @xmath13 is @xmath42",
    "gopala _ et al . _ in @xcite investigated the secrecy capacity in ergodic fading channels without delay constraints .",
    "they considered two cases : full csi at the transmitter and only main csi at the transmitter . in this section",
    ", we also consider these two cases but in the presence of statistical qos constraints .      in this part",
    ", we assume that the perfect csi of the main channel and the eavesdropper channel is available at the transmitter .",
    "the transmitter is able to adapt the transmitted power according to the instantaneous values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 only when @xmath43 .",
    "the secrecy capacity is then given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the optimal power allocated when @xmath10 and @xmath11 are known at the transmitter .    in the presence of qos constraints , the optimal power allocation policy in general depends on the qos exponent @xmath24 to denote the power allocation policy under qos constraints . ] .",
    "hence , the secure throughput can be expressed as    @xmath46    note that the first term in the @xmath47 function is a constant , and @xmath47 is a monotonically increasing function .",
    "the maximization problem in ( [ eq : fullcsimaxp ] ) is equivalent to the following minimization problem @xmath48 it is easy to check that when @xmath43 @xmath49 is a convex function in @xmath50 . according to @xcite , non - negative integral preserves convexity ,",
    "hence the objective function is convex in @xmath50 .",
    "then , we can form the following lagrangian function , denoted as @xmath51 :    @xmath52    taking the derivative of the lagrangian function over @xmath53 , we get the following optimality condition : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the lagrange multiplier whose value is chosen to satisfy the average power constraint with equality . for any channel state pairs @xmath56 , @xmath53 can be obtained from the above condition .",
    "whenever the value of @xmath53 is negative , it follows from the convexity of the objective function with respect to @xmath53 that the optimal value of @xmath53 is 0 .",
    "there is no closed - form solution to ( [ eq : fullcsioptcond ] ) .",
    "however , since the left - hand side of ( [ eq : fullcsioptcond ] ) is a monotonically increasing concave function , numerical techniques such as bisection search method can be efficiently adopted to derive the solution .",
    "the secure throughput can be determined by substituting the optimal power control policy for @xmath53 in ( [ eq : fullcsimaxp ] ) . exploiting the optimality condition in ( [ eq : fullcsioptcond ] ) , we can notice that when @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath59 thus , we must have @xmath60 for @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath57 if @xmath62 .",
    "hence , we can write the secure throughput as @xmath63 where @xmath53 is the derived optimal power control policy .      in this section , we assume that the transmitter has only the csi of the main channel ( the channel between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver ) . under this assumption ,",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the secrecy rate for a specific channel state pair becomes @xmath64^+\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the optimal power allocated when only @xmath10 is known at the transmitter .    in this case , the secure throughput can be expressed as    @xmath66    similar to the discussion in section [ sec : fullcsi ] , we get the following equivalent minimization problem : @xmath67 the objective function in this case is convex , and with a similar lagrangian optimization method , we can get the following optimality condition : @xmath68 where @xmath55 is a constant chosen to satisfy the average power constraint with equality .",
    "if the obtained power level @xmath69 is negative , then the optimal value of @xmath69 becomes 0 according to the convexity of the objective function in ( [ eq : maincsimaxprev ] ) .",
    "now that non - negative integral does not change the concavity , the lhs of ( [ eq : maincsioptcond ] ) is still a monotonic increasing concave function of @xmath69 .     in rayleigh channel with @xmath70 .",

    "considering that @xmath74 we must have @xmath75 for @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath77 if @xmath78 . hence , we can write the secure throughput as @xmath79 where @xmath69 is the derived optimal power control policy .      in fig .",

    "[ fig : fixedsnr ] , we plot the effective secure throughput as @xmath80 varies for @xmath81 .",
    "not surprisingly , we observe that the availability of the csi of the eavesdropper channel at the transmitter does not provide much gains in terms of increasing the effective secure throughput in the large @xmath80 regime .",
    "also , as qos constraints becomes more strict , we similarly note that having the csi of the eavesdropper channel does not increase the rate of secure transmission much even at medium @xmath80 levels .     in rayleigh channel with @xmath70 .",

    ", we see that for both values of @xmath24 , no power is allocated for transmission when @xmath85 which is expected under the assumption of equal noise powers , i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "we note that when @xmath87 and hence there are no buffer constraints , opportunistic transmission policy is employed .",

    "when @xmath88 is small , transmission occurs at a small rate with small power .",
    "however , this strategy is clearly not optimal in the presence of buffer constraints because waiting to transmit at high rate until the main channel becomes much stronger than the eavesdropper channel can lead to buildup in the buffer and incur large delays .",
