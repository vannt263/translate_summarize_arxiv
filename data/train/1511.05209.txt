    "over the last years the existence of exotic hadrons has been firmly established @xcite and now the next step is to determine their structure . among the proposed configurations the meson molecule and the tetraquark are the",
    "most often discussed .",
    "so far almost all the experimental information about these states comes from their production in b decays .",
    "the production of exotic particles in proton proton collisions is one of the most promising testing grounds for our ideas about the structure of the new states .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that it is extremely difficult to produce molecules in p p collisions . in the molecular approach the estimated cross section for @xmath0",
    "production is two orders of magnitude smaller than the measured one .",
    "the present challenge for theorists is to show that these data can be explained by the tetraquark model . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this has not been done so far . in this work",
    "we give a step in this direction , considering the production of the @xmath0 and of the @xmath1 , a state composed by two charm quark pairs : @xmath2 .    in recent high energy collisions at the lhc , it became relatively easy to produce @xcite four charm quarks ( @xmath2 ) in the same event .",
    "events with four heavy quarks can be treated as a particular case of @xmath4 correction to the standard single gluon - gluon scattering , in which an extra @xmath5 pair is produced , i.e. , the process @xmath6 .",
    "this is usually called single parton scattering ( sps ) . another possible way to produce @xmath2",
    "is by two independent leading order gluon - gluon scatterings , i.e. two times the reaction @xmath7 .",
    "this is usually called double parton scattering ( dps ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , apart from @xmath2 , dps events may generate many other different final states , such as four jets , a @xmath8 pair plus two jets , etc . for our purposes ,",
    "the other relevant dps process is the production of a @xmath8 pair plus a light quark pair , @xmath9 , which will hadronize and form the @xmath0 .",
    "since dps events are in the realm of perturbative physics , the light quark pair must be produced with large invariant mass and the final state @xmath0 will carry large transverse momentum .",
    "this seems to be appropriate to describe the cms data @xcite , where the @xmath0 was observed with a transverse momentum lying in the range @xmath10 gev . in @xcite it has been shown that dps charm production is already comparable to sps production at lhc energies .",
    "dps grows faster with the energy because it is proportional to @xmath11 while sps is proportional to @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the gluon density in the proton as a function of the gluon fractional momentum @xmath14 and of the scale @xmath15 and it grows quickly with increasing collision energies . in the present work we shall consider the dps events with the production of the two @xmath5 pairs and also with a @xmath5 and a light quark @xmath16 pair .",
    "once we have generated all the quarks and antiquarks needed to form the @xmath0 or the @xmath1 in dps events , we need to bind them together . to this end we shall use the main ideas of the color evaporation model ( cem ) @xcite of charmonium production , where the @xmath8 is `` kinematically bound '' , i.e. , the charm pair sticks together because it does not have an invariant mass large enough to produce anything else .",
    "we shall use the cem ideas to study @xmath1 and @xmath0 production in dps events . in the cem",
    "formalism one parton from the hadron target scatters with one parton from the hadron projectile forming a charmonium state , which can absorb ( emit ) additional gluons from ( to ) the hadronic color field to become color neutral .",
    "this is the usual ( sps ) @xmath5 production . at high energies",
    "the gluon density in the proton is much bigger than the sea quark density and hence , in what follows , we shall consider particle production only from gluon - gluon collisions .",
    "now we are going to extend the cem to the case where two gluons from the hadron target scatter independently with two gluons from the hadron projectile as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we show dps production of @xmath1 . in the figure",
    "two gluons collide and form a @xmath5 state with mass @xmath17 , while other two gluons collide and form a second @xmath5 state with mass @xmath18 .",
    "the two objects bind to each other forming the @xmath1 .",
    "additional gluon exchanges with the environment are not shown in the figure .",
    "replacing one @xmath5 pair by a light quark pair , @xmath16 , the diagram would describe the production of @xmath0 .",
    "the main difference between a tetraquark and a meson molecule is that the former is compact and the interaction between the constituents occurs through color exchange forces whereas the latter is an extended object and the interaction between its constituents happens through meson exchange forces . in what was said above no explicit mention to size or color",
    "however when we speak about the initial gluon fusion and about the final color neutralization through gluon emission or absorption it is understood that all this must happen within the confinement scale @xmath19 fm .",
    "for this reason we believe that our model is suitable to describe tetraquark production .",
    "although not explicitly excluded , it seems very unlikely that the clusters with masses @xmath17 and @xmath18 will form color singlets interacting through meson exchange .    . the `` gluon 1 '' scatters with `` gluon 2 '' , making the state @xmath17 .",
    "an analogous process occurs with gluons 3 and 4 .",
    "finally @xmath17 and @xmath18 merge and form the @xmath1 with mass @xmath20 . ]      working with the usual cem one - dimensional kinematics , the rapidities of the objects @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively : @xmath21 and their invariant masses are @xmath22 in terms of these variables and in the low @xmath23 regime , the invariant mass of the @xmath2 system is then given by : @xmath24 the @xmath25 function grows very rapidly with the argument and hence even a modest rapidity difference between the two clusters with @xmath17 and @xmath18 will significantly increase the value of @xmath20 .",
    "we will then assume that both clusters move with equal rapidity , i.e. @xmath26 , and become bound to each other , forming a system with mass : @xmath27 finally , in order to produce the final tetraquark state with right mass , @xmath28 , the cluster with mass @xmath20 emits or absorbs gluons carrying an energy @xmath29 , which will be discussed below .",
    "we have thus : @xmath30 a remarkable difference between the standard cem for charmonium production and the model developed here is in the role played by the limits of the integral over the squared invariant mass @xmath31 . in the case of the usual @xmath32 production it goes from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "this ensures that the @xmath35 can never decay into open charm , not forming the charmonium state , because it does not have enough invariant mass . the case of the tetraquark",
    "@xmath0 is different .",
    "suppose , for example , that we have the four - quark system with an invariant mass of @xmath36 mev . while this system can only form the @xmath37 resonance by absorbing some gluons ( carrying energy @xmath29 ) from the target or from the projectile , it has sufficient mass to decay immediately into a @xmath38 pair and not form the resonance . moreover , since the energy @xmath29 is carried by an undefined number of gluons , this decay is not hindered by parity ( or charge conjugation ) conservation .",
    "therefore , in our case , the integration over @xmath31 must be changed becoming more restrictive : @xmath39 where the left side refers to the usual cem and the right side refers to tetraquark states .",
    "we will use this restriction in sec .",
    "the @xmath1 state was first discussed long time ago by iwasaky @xcite . in the eighties and early nineties ,",
    "many authors @xcite addressed the subject arriving at different conclusions concerning the existence of a @xmath2 bound state .",
    "more recently , with the revival of charmonium spectroscopy , lloyd and vary @xcite investigated the four - body @xmath2 system obtaining several close - lying bound states .",
    "they found that deeply bound ( @xmath40 mev ) states may exist with masses around @xmath41 gev . in ref .",
    "@xcite the existence of @xmath2 states was discussed in the framework of the hyperspherical harmonic formalism .",
    "the results suggested the possible existence of three four - quark bound states with quantum numbers @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 and masses of the order of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 gev .",
    "more recently , using the bethe - salpeter approach , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found an all - charm tetraquark with @xmath48 and mass @xmath49 gev .",
    "this mass is considerably lower than the @xmath50 gev obtained in the previous model calculations @xcite .",
    "it is also much lower than the @xmath51 threshold .",
    "potential decay channels into d mesons and pairs of light mesons necessarily involve internal gluon lines",
    ". the resulting decay width may therefore be rather small .",
    "on the other hand , preliminary lattice qcd calculations @xcite seem to disfavor the existence of a deeply bound @xmath2 state , being more compatible with a loosely bound @xmath51 molecular state . in the works @xcite @xmath1 production was studied in sps events .",
    "the cross section of the process shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] can be calculated with the schematic dps `` pocket '' formula : @xmath52 where @xmath53 mb is a constant extracted from data analysis and @xmath54 is the standard qcd parton model formula , i. e. , the convolution of parton densities with partonic cross sections . to be more precise",
    "we expand the above formula showing the kinematical constraints introduced to study tetraquark production .",
    "it reads : @xmath55 \\nonumber \\\\    & \\times & \\,\\ ,   \\left [   \\int _ 0 ^ 1 dx_3 \\int _ 0 ^ 1 dx_4 \\,\\ , g(x_3,\\mu^2 ) \\ , g(x_4,\\mu^2 ) \\ , \\sigma _",

    "the step functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 enforce momentum conservation in the projectile and in the target . the step functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 guarantee that the invariant masses of the gluon pairs 12 and 34 are large enough to produce two charm quark pairs .",
    "the delta function implements the `` binding condition '' and @xmath63 is a constant , analogous to the one appearing in the cem formula , which represents the probability of the four - quark system to evolve to a particular tetraquark state .    in the above formula",
    ", all the variables depend on the momentum fractions @xmath64 ... @xmath65 . because of the delta function",
    ", we know that the two clusters shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] are `` flying together '' and that they form a system with mass @xmath66 , which can take any value . in order to improve our kinematical description of this bound state",
    ", we can impose constraints on the values of @xmath20 , such as ( [ redef ] ) .",
    "this can be best done rewritting ( [ sigtot ] ) and changing variables from @xmath64 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath65 to @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath71 \\nonumber \\\\    & \\times & \\,\\ , \\left [ \\frac{1}{s } \\int   dy_{34 } \\int   dm_{34}^2 \\,\\ , g(\\bar{x_3},\\mu^2 ) \\ , g(\\bar{x_4},\\mu^2 ) \\ , \\sigma _ { g_3 g_4 \\to c\\bar{c } } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\    & \\times & \\,\\ , \\theta ( 1- \\bar{x_1 } - \\bar{x_3 } ) \\,\\,\\theta ( 1- \\bar{x_2 } - \\bar{x_4 } ) \\,\\ , \\theta ( m_{12}^2 - 4m_c^2 ) \\,\\ , \\theta ( m_{34}^2 - 4m_c^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\,\\ , \\delta(y_{34 } - y_{12 } ) \\label{sigtotym}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and consequently @xmath73 from the above expressions it is easy to see that when @xmath74 , then ( [ msum ] ) holds and the theta functions give lower and upper limits for the integration in @xmath75 : @xmath76 the upper limit of @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be fixed imposing constraints on their sum , @xmath20 . in the case of the @xmath0 we already know the mass of the state that we want to produce . in principle",
    "we could just use ( [ msum ] ) with a fixed value of @xmath20 .",
    "however , following the spirit of the cem , we will assume that when the system with mass @xmath66 goes to the final state with mass @xmath28 it can absorb or emit soft gluons to neutralize color .",
    "these gluons carry an energy going from almost zero to the qcd scale , given by @xmath77 .",
    "then , from ( [ msum ] ) and ( [ msumt ] ) we have : @xmath78 and @xmath79 from these equations we can see that , knowing the mass of the tetraquark state and fixing the amount of energy which can be exchanged in the formation of the final state , we constrain the limits in the integrations over @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the symmetric case of @xmath1 production @xmath80 , @xmath81 , ( [ minf ] ) and ( [ msup ] ) completely fix these limits . in the case of the @xmath0",
    ", we may have different choices for @xmath82 and @xmath83 but they will be correlated .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we take the production cross section of the @xmath1 as a baseline because it is heavy , and hence treatable in pqcd , and also to make some contact with the production of @xmath2 in dps . in this subsection",
    "we discuss the numerical results obtained for @xmath1 .",
    "then in the following subsection , after only a few changes we calculate the cross section for @xmath0 production .",
    "we now evaluate equation ( [ sigtotym ] ) replacing @xmath13 by the mrst gluon distribution @xcite and @xmath84 by the standard leading order qcd result @xcite : @xmath85 \\ , - \\ , \\frac{1}{4 } ( 7 + \\frac{31 m^2_c}{m^2 } )   \\beta } \\right\\ } \\label{sigramona}\\ ] ] with @xmath86^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is equal to @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "a difficulty in our calculation is the uncertainty in the normalization of the cross section .",
    "whereas in the case of charmonium production in the cem we have experimental information , which can be used to fix the nonperturbative constant @xmath90 , in the case of the @xmath1 nothing is known . for the time being we can only try to make a simple estimate .    in the usual cem it is assumed that the nonperturbative probability for the @xmath91 pair to evolve into a quarkonium state h is given by a constant @xmath92 that is energy - momentum and process independent . once @xmath92 has been fixed by comparison with the measured total cross section for the production of the quarkonium h at one given energy ,",
    "the cem can predict , with no additional free parameters , the energy dependence of the production cross section and the momentum distribution of the produced quarkonium . following the cem strategy we shall adjust @xmath93 connecting it to the experimentally measured cross section of @xmath0 production at one single energy and",
    "then make predictions for higher energies .",
    "we know that the production cross section of @xmath1 must be smaller than the one for @xmath0 production and the latter has been measured by the cms collaboration @xcite at @xmath94 tev . moreover , assuming that the binding mechanism is the same , the only difference is that we must replace the light quark pair ( which is in the @xmath0 ) by the @xmath5 pair , which is much more difficult to produce .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the cross section for producing the @xmath1 , we must multiply the @xmath0 production cross section , @xmath95 , by a penalty factor : @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the cross sections for the production of @xmath2 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "these cross sections can be measured in double parton scattering events . in the above expression , after using the factorization hypothesis , @xmath100 cancels out and the ratio @xmath101 can be inferred from data @xcite , which at @xmath102 tev yield @xmath103 .",
    "all the required numbers are collected in table i. finally , using the value of @xmath104 nb @xcite , we have : @xmath105 having fixed the numbers we plot the cross section for @xmath1 production as a function of the energy in fig . [ fig2 ] . in order to obtain an estimate of the theoretical error we vary the parameters trying to scan the most relevant region in the parameter space .",
    "we choose @xmath106 mev and we assume that the @xmath1 mass is given by @xmath107 gev , as obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . with these two parameters fixed",
    "we can choose different values for the charm mass @xmath108 .",
    "however there is an upper limit for @xmath108 , which can not be bigger than @xmath109 . substituting @xmath29 and @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ minf ] ) we find that @xmath111 gev , consequently the maximum value for @xmath108 is @xmath112 gev . in fig .",

    "the star in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] corresponds to the central value at @xmath94 tev . here",
    "the constant @xmath63 was chosen so as to reproduce ( [ sigtf ] ) .",
    "once all the parameters are fixed at @xmath94 tev , the energy dependence of the cross section is completely determined by the model . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the cross represents the central value of our prediction for the energy @xmath115 tev : @xmath116 the main feature of the curves is the rapid rise with @xmath3 , which might render the @xmath1 observable already at 14 tev .",
    "this same fast growing trend was observed in other estimates with dps @xcite .    .@xmath0 and @xmath1 production cross sections at @xmath117 tev and @xmath118 tev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]",
    "production as a function of the energy .",
    ", width=340 ]      we now turn to the production cross section of @xmath0 .",
    "we use the same parton densities as in the previous subsection and also the elementary cross section for heavy quark production ( [ sigramona ] ) . note that we use this expression even for light quark production @xmath119 , which appears now in the second line of ( [ sigtot ] ) or ( [ sigtotym ] ) .",
    "since this expression only holds for heavy enough quarks , its use here is questionable . in spite of this uncertainty ,",
    "the existing experience in the literature is encouraging . in @xcite",
    "the authors used ( [ sigramona ] ) to compute the cross section of strange particle production and calculated the asymmetries in the production of @xmath120 , @xmath121 , ... etc .",
    "they have used the convolution formula of the parton model and have taken the strange quark mass to be @xmath122 mev .",
    "they could reproduce well the existing data on asymmetries . in our case",
    "the invariant mass @xmath18 defines the perturbative qcd scale and hence we must have @xmath123 gev .",
    "this can be achieved with the light quarks having masses close to zero and transverse momenta in the few gev region .",
    "since we are using the one - dimensional version of the cem , instead of transverse momentum we will assign an effective mass to the light quarks , @xmath124 gev , which garantees that @xmath125 gev .",
    "moreover , choosing @xmath126 and @xmath127 mev , we have typically : @xmath128 although we may expect significant corrections , this number is still small enough for perturbation theory to make sense . as in the previous subsection , after fixing these parameters and knowing the tetraquark mass @xmath129 mev the only remaining free parameters are the charm mass and the constant @xmath130 .",
    "we show our results in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the upper line corresponds to @xmath113 gev and the lower line corresponds to @xmath114 gev .",
    "the constant @xmath130 was adjusted so that the central value of the cross section at @xmath94 tev ( shown with a star ) corresponds to @xmath131 nb . with all the numbers fixed at the lower energy the energy dependence is given by the model . at @xmath115 tev",
    ", the cross indicates the central value of our prediction : @xmath132     production cross section as a function of the energy.,width=340 ]    the error in the number given above is relatively large but , at least we can predicit the order of magnitude of the cross section . as a first estimate with dps",
    ", we think that the result is satisfactory .",
    "the model presented here can be improved in several aspects .",
    "probably the most relevant one is the prescription to form the resonance , i.e. , the hadronization of the multiquark system .",
    "progress in this direction would also benefit the sps calculations of this process .",
    "our prescription , based mostly on the kinematical aspects and using only the rapidities and invariant masses , is not accurate enough and is the largest source of uncertainties .",
    "work along this line is in progress .",
    "the other sources of uncertainties are , as usual , the choice of parton densities , the choice of the energy scale at which they are computed , the choice of the scale at which @xmath133 is computed , the choice of @xmath134 , and the charm and light quark masses .",
    "we have developed a model for tetraquark production which combines double parton scattering and the basic ideas of the color evaporation model .",
    "we have made predictions for the @xmath0 production cross section , which may be confronted with the forthcoming lhc data taken at @xmath115 tev .",
    "the results presented above contain some uncertainties : i ) they do not include tetraquark production in sps events , which can be larger than the dps cross section .",
    "the calculation of the sps cross section requires some fragmentation function which is not known . ;",
    "ii ) the binding mechanism is probably too simple and insensitive to the quantum numbers of the involved particles ; iii ) in the case of @xmath0 production , the use of formula ( [ sigramona ] ) for light quark production is questionable .",
    "this problem may be circunvented using the next - to - leading order version of the cem , in which the transverse momentum is included . in this case",
