    "a clear understanding of many - body entanglement is centrally important for the fundamental description of microscopic systems . within the framework of quantum information science , entanglement",
    "may be viewed as a resource for the processing of information in ways not permitted by classical logic @xcite .",
    "this has stimulated an intense research effort aimed at studying the properties of multipartite entanglement , and in turn , experience gained from such studies is providing fruitful insights into the complex behaviour of condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "however , the characterisation and quantification of multipartite entanglement remains an open problem ; a full classification has only been achieved for small numbers of qubits @xcite and the extension to larger systems represents a formidable challenge .",
    "the _ experimental generation _ and investigation of multipartite entangled states is therefore a highly desirable tool for the future characterisation of many - body entanglement . in this regard ,",
    "an interesting class of such states are the _ dicke states _ , @xmath1 , in which @xmath2 excitations are distributed evenly amongst @xmath3 parties in an equal coherent superposition @xcite : @xmath4 here , the symmetrization operator , @xmath5 creates an ( un - normalised ) equal superposition of all distinct permutations of the @xmath3 qubits , which number .",
    "dicke states exhibit genuine multi - body entanglement @xcite and are also robust against particle loss and measurement @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the entanglement contained in such states can not be destroyed by local operations performed on any constituent particle @xcite , making them interesting from the point of view of quantum communication between many participants .",
    "the notation @xmath1 emphasises that the dicke states represent a generalisation to @xmath2 excitations of the more ubiquitous w - states , in which a single excitation is shared evenly between @xmath3 sites .",
    "we note that while w - states of up to eight ions have been created experimentally in ion traps @xcite , the extension to higher numbers of excitations represents a major challenge , both from a theoretical and experimental perspective .",
    "this is because the dimension of the relevant hilbert space , @xmath6 , grows very rapidly with the number of excitations involved .",
    "theoretical proposals exist for the generation of dicke states in a number of physical systems , including ensembles of neutral atoms @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , quantum dots @xcite and using linear optics @xcite .",
    "ion traps are perhaps the best suited of these for the manipulation of entanglement in matter systems since they offer an unparalleled level of experimental control ; the state of individual qubits can be initialised , manipulated and read out with @xmath7 precision , and information can be stored without loss for times many orders of magnitude longer than typical gate operation times . by using",
    "carefully chosen laser pulses , the ions internal and motional degrees of freedom can be coupled , and allowing different ions to interact with a common vibrational mode ( the ` bus - mode ' ) then creates an effective interaction between the ions through which entanglement can be generated @xcite . in this manner ,",
    "entangling gates have been performed with high fidelity @xcite , and complex multipartite entangled states have been created @xcite .",
    "the generation of large coherent superpositions in contemporary ion - trap quantum information science is limited by two major sources of decoherence .",
    "these are : as the ions decay from high - lying energy states , occupied transiently during internal transitions ; caused by coupling between the ions and fluctuating patch potentials on the surface of the electrodes used to trap the ions ; this has the effect of adding or removing vibrational quanta from the system at random .",
    "various techniques have been proposed with the aim of limiting the effects of spontaneous emission .",
    "of particular note is the technique for robust transfer of population between internal levels of a single particle @xcite which has recently been applied to coherent population transfer in a _",
    "single _ ion with over @xmath8 fidelity @xcite . here , a _ dark state _ of the system is utilised",
    ", in which higher - energy levels always remain unoccupied . in the adiabatic limit (",
    "whereby the system remains in the dark state at all times ) , the technique is therefore decoherence - free with respect to spontaneous emission .",
    "recently , it has been suggested to use variants of the traditional process in order to implement two - ion quantum gates @xcite and to generate arbitrary entangled states of a two - spin system @xcite .    regarding the second source of decoherence mentioned above",
    ", motional heating of the ion chain by its environment appears to be unavoidable in traditional multiple - step techniques , and the degradation to the state that this causes grows with the time taken for the state preparation .",
    "therefore the ( traditional ) approach of using many sequential steps , each of which addresses an individual ion , appears unsuitable for the creation of large entangled states ; the hilbert space dimension and hence the number of steps required by an individual addressing approach increases extremely rapidly with both the number of ions and the number of quanta involved .    a promising route to limiting the number of interaction steps is to address all of the ions simultaneously using common laser pulses ( a technique known as _ global addressing _ ) .",
    "in this way , the time required , and hence the effects of heating , can be dramatically reduced .",
    "several global addressing schemes have been proposed @xcite and experimentally implemented @xcite for the generation of entanglement in trapped ion systems .",
    "an alternative route to limiting the effects of heating is to look for schemes which do not require the number of motional quanta to be controlled precisely @xcite . in this",
    "situation , modest vibrational heating can be tolerated and spontaneous emission is then the dominant source of decoherence .    to date , it has not been possible to find an approach to entangled state generation which integrates the advantages of insensitivity to vibrational heating alongside a robustness against spontaneous emission .",
    "below , we present a scheme which goes some way towards this aim , by being fully immune to spontaneous emission and largely insensitive to heating effects .",
    "we propose to generate dicke states of _ arbitrary size _ in a chain of trapped ions using global addressing by two pairs of overlapping , counter - intuitively ordered laser pulses . with an appropriate choice of the laser parameters , it is possible to navigate through the overall hilbert space and into the target state whilst remaining in the multi - ion dark state at all times . because the technique presented in this article is very rapid , the destructive effects of heating are largely circumvented , while the use of a multi - ion dark state means that spontaneous emission can be avoided completely in the adiabatic limit .",
    "consequently , the fidelity of the state preparation using our technique can be extremely high .",
    "moreover , the implementation is appealingly simple : it requires only two pairs of sufficiently intense and suitably delayed laser pulses , rather than sophisticated sequences of great number of pulses of precise areas , as in traditional approaches .",
    "the remainder of this article is organised as follows : in section [ model ] , a hamiltonian is introduced to describe a chain of @xmath3 ions interacting with a pair of common laser pulses , tuned on resonance with the first red motional sideband .",
    "two important properties possessed by this hamiltonian are considered in section [ symmetries ] , and by exploiting the symmetry of the chosen system , it is shown in subsection [ dark_state ] that the system possesses a unique multi - ion dark state which is immune to spontaneous emission . in section [ generation ] , we show that , remarkably , dicke states of arbitrary size can be generated robustly and efficiently in two steps , by adiabatic transfer along this dark - state . during the transfer process",
    ", the dark - state evolves through a network of increasingly complex @xmath3-particle entangled states .",
    "the net phase acquired during the state preparation is identically zero .",
    "section [ numerical ] discusses the conditions required for adiabatic following of the dark state , since this is important to the success of our technique .",
    "other sources of decoherence , such as vibrational heating and parameter fluctuations are considered in section [ technical ] , and it is found that the method presented in the current paper is robust against these types of decoherence also . in section [ conclusions ] , we summarise our findings .",
    "we consider a chain of @xmath3 identical ions trapped in a linear array and cooled to their ground state .",
    "each ion has three relevant internal levels , as shown in fig .",
    "[ three_level_ion ] .",
    "the computational basis states , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are encoded in two hyperfine or zeeman sub - levels in the electronic ground state of the ion and typically have very good coherence properties @xcite . coupling between these two internal states is achieved by a two - photon raman process , via the upper - level , @xmath11 using only a single pair of pulses ( labelled @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , each of which addresses the entire chain .",
    "overall , the laser - frequencies , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are tuned to the first red motional sideband of the centre - of - mass mode for the transition , while @xmath14 is tuned near to the first red sideband for the transition , i.e.    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the bohr frequencies of the transitions @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , @xmath21 is the trap frequency and @xmath22 is a constant single - photon detuning .",
    "we note that in contrast to existing raman - coupled schemes in ion traps @xcite , the technique proposed below , does _ not _ require adiabatic elimination of the state @xmath11 in order to limit spontaneous emission and in fact we choose @xmath23 . in this limit [ and because ultimately there will be no decay from @xmath11 ] , the sideband structure on the @xmath19 transition can be resolved . in the lamb - dicke limit and after making the rotating - wave approximation , the hamiltonian for this system ( with @xmath25 throughout this paper ) is : @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\ + & \\omega_{b}(t)\\big[\\vert{}e\\rangle_{j}\\langle{}1\\vert_{j}\\exp\\left(i\\delta{}t - i\\phi^{b}_{j}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\    + & \\vert{}1\\rangle_{j}\\langle{}e\\vert_{j}\\exp\\left(-i\\delta{}t+i\\phi^{b}_{j}\\right)\\big]\\bigg\\}. \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] above , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the creation and annihilation operators for centre - of - mass phonons and @xmath29 is an effective rabi frequency , defined by , which describes the coupling between the motional and internal states of the ions @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are the ( real - valued ) bare rabi frequencies for each laser pulse .",
    "the single - ion lamb - dicke parameter for pulse @xmath12 is , with @xmath32 being the laser wave - number and @xmath33 the angle between the trap axis and beam direction for laser beam @xmath12 , and @xmath34 the mass of one ion .",
    "equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) applies in the lamb - dicke limit , for which @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of phonons in the centre - of - mass vibrational mode .",
    "also , the trap frequency @xmath21 must satisfy @xmath37 because the ions in a paul trap are spaced unevenly along the trap axis , there will always be some nonzero phases    @xmath38    where @xmath39 are the equilibrium positions of the ions and @xmath40 the laser phases at the trap centre at @xmath41 .",
    "however , by performing a time dependent phase - transformation : @xmath42 with @xmath43 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\;\\times   \\exp\\left[i\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(\\phi^{b}_{j}-\\phi^{a}_{j})\\vert{}1\\rangle_{j}\\langle{}1\\vert_{j}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be put into the following simpler form , in which each laser couples equally to all ions : @xmath44 \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{\\omega_{b}(t)}{2}\\big[\\vert{}1\\rangle_{j}\\langle{}e\\vert_{j }   + \\vert{}e\\rangle_{j}\\langle{}1\\vert_{j}\\big ] + \\delta\\vert{}e\\rangle_{j}\\langle{}e\\vert_{j}\\bigg\\}. \\label{hamiltonian_no_phases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for clarity , we shall first treat the case of equal couplings , given by ( [ hamiltonian_no_phases ] ) , and choose to postpone discussion of the effects of the phase - factors , @xmath45 until section [ technical ] , where several other technical considerations are also addressed .",
    "and @xmath46 are hyperfine or zeeman sub - levels of the ion s ground state and have very good coherence properties .",
    "by contrast , decay from the excited state @xmath11 is typically a significant source of decoherence in modern ion - trap quantum information processing experiments @xcite . ]",
    "while the two computational basis states can have very long coherence times [ up to several minutes @xcite ] , decay from the upper state @xmath11 often has a significant effect on the dynamics and in current experiments can even dominate the error budget for entangling gates @xcite .",
    "therefore , leaving aside for the moment vibrational heating of the centre - of - mass mode [ we shall return to this issue in section [ technical ] ] , the overall dissipative dynamics is governed by the following master equation : @xmath47 + \\widehat{\\mathcal{l}}\\hat{\\rho}(t ) . \\label{liouville}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath48 is a liouvillian super - operator corresponding to spontaneous emission from the state @xmath11 into either the computational basis states , or other levels , at rate @xmath49 .",
    "if the upper state @xmath11 is occupied , even transiently during the state preparation , the overall fidelity will decrease , due to the dissipative term , @xmath50 .",
    "by contrast , if the state @xmath11 remains unoccupied at all times , then this dissipative term has no effect on the dynamics , and equation ( [ liouville ] ) can be replaced by the schrdinger equation for a pure state , @xmath51 .",
    "below , we shall describe a method for creating dicke states using global addressing , for which the evolution takes place along a multi - ion dark state . in the adiabatic limit ,",
    "the coupling between this dark state and all other states in the hilbert space is small enough that spontaneous emission from the level @xmath11 can be neglected .",
    "we therefore expect spontaneous emission to have only a perturbative effect on the dynamics and so choose to work in terms of a state vector , @xmath52 , and the schrdinger equation , rather than a density operator and equation ( [ liouville ] ) .",
    "the effects of emission from state @xmath11 can still be included , simply by making the following replacement : @xmath53 the above replacement is computationally simpler than solving the full master equation , ( [ liouville ] ) , and is physically equivalent to the assumption that all spontaneous emission from @xmath11 takes place into ionic levels other than @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we note that the norm of the state - vector calculated using ( [ complex_delta ] ) is not constant , since after introducing a complex detuning , the hamiltonian is no longer hermitian .",
    "the effects of spontaneous emission are therefore manifest through a reduction in the norm of @xmath51 . by making the replacement ( [ complex_delta ] )",
    "we are taking a conservative approach in the sense that the fidelity calculated using this reduced - norm state vector is always less than or equal to the true fidelity calculated using ( [ liouville ] ) .",
    "the above hamiltonian , ( [ hamiltonian_no_phases ] ) , possesses two important properties .",
    "the first is that the total number of excitations , @xmath54 commutes with @xmath55 and is therefore a conserved quantity .",
    "if the system is prepared in a state with a specific number of quanta , @xmath2 , then the subspace of states containing @xmath2 quanta is closed upon evolution under the schrdinger equation .",
    "however even when the system is restricted to the subspace containing exactly @xmath2 quanta , the dimension of this subspace is still , which grows rapidly with both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "a brute - force approach to solving the dynamics is clearly impractical .",
    "fortunately however , @xmath55 possesses a symmetry that permits a further simplification of the dynamics  the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_no_phases ] ) is invariant under interchange of any two ions . providing that the system begins in a symmetric state , it will always evolve through symmetric states at later times and with an appropriate choice of basis , the dynamics is confined to a closed @xmath56-dimensional subspace of @xmath6 .",

    "clearly , such an eigenstate can not involve the state @xmath11 in any of the ions and therefore in the interaction - picture defined by @xmath55 , a dark state has zero eigenvalue , i.e. @xmath73 here @xmath74 are the elements of the dark - state vector , @xmath75 and the index @xmath76 runs over all states defined in equation ( [ considered_states ] ) .",

    "each state is only coupled to states in neighbouring horizontal manifolds and the coupling always links states with a different value of @xmath59 . as in other figures ,",
    "the red couplings are proportional to @xmath78 and the blue couplings are proportional to @xmath79 . ]    to facilitate the derivation of @xmath72 , we choose to group the states @xmath57 into horizontal manifolds according to @xmath59 , i.e. the number of ions in state @xmath11 .",
    "the other ions are found in either state @xmath9 or @xmath10 , and all distinct permutations of the ions states with an appropriate number of excitations are to be included .",
    "the reason that we have chosen to express the level scheme in this way is as follows . by definition , a dark state can only involve the states in the lowest ( @xmath80 ) manifold , since all other states can decay by spontaneous emission . therefore only this manifold and the states which are directly coupled to this manifold are relevant .",

    "the reason that these are the ` relevant ' states is that the other manifolds are all ( i ) unoccupied and ( ii ) only coupled to unoccupied manifolds .",
    "therefore , we automatically have :    @xmath82    and so eq . ( [ dark_state_condition ] ) reduces to the much simpler condition @xmath83    therefore , if a dark state exists , the couplings to and between states that lie outside of @xmath81 are irrelevant , and can be neglected , as shown in fig .",

    "furthermore , after noting that the only states that are ever involved in the dark state are dicke states , we may revert to the simpler notation introduced in eq .",
