    "an increasingly relevant aspect of proton - proton collisions at high energies is double parton scattering ( dps ) , where two partons from each proton interact in two separate hard subprocesses .",
    "dps contributes to many final states of interest at the lhc .",
    "they constitute relevant backgrounds to precise higgs boson coupling measurements and searchers for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "our knowledge of dps is fragmentary , and improvements are needed at both conceptual and quantitative level ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "schematically the dps cross section can be expressed as @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents hard subprocess @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a combinatorial factor equal to two ( one ) if the partonic subprocesses are ( not ) identical and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) labels the double parton distribution of the proton with momentum @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the dpds depend on the longitudinal momentum fractions of the two partons @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and the distance between them @xmath10 .",
    "implicit in this expression are the labels for the different flavors , colors , fermion numbers and spins of the four partons .",
    "this quantum - number structure is significantly more complicated in dps compared to the case with only one hard interaction , because of the possibility of interference between the two hard interactions and correlations between the two partons inside each proton .",
    "the correlations can be of kinematical type ( between @xmath8 s and @xmath11 ) , or between the quantum numbers of the two partons . while the kinematical type affects dependence of the dpds on the kinematical variables , the quantum - number correlations lead to a large number of different dpds .",
    "the dpds depend on long distance , non - perturbative physics and can thus not be calculated in perturbative qcd .",
    "including all the correlations and their dpds in phenomenological calculations is cumbersome , and extracting all of them experimentally is unfeasible .",
    "an effective way of reducing the number of dpds of experimental relevance is studying the scale evolution of the dpds and the correlations they describe .",
    "for example , it has been demonstrated for quark and antiquark dpds that color interference terms is suppressed by sudakov factors at large scales @xcite , which when combined with positivity bounds constraining the size of the correlations at low scales @xcite set limits on the scale at which these correlations can be of experimental relevance .",
    "the scale evolution of the dpds are described by generalizations of the usual dglap evolution equations .",
    "two versions of this have been discussed in the literature : a homogeneous equation describing the separate evolution of each of the two partons and an inhomogeneous including also the splitting of one parent parton into the two partons that undergo hard scattering @xcite .",
    "which version is adequate for the description of dps processes remains controversial in the literature @xcite .",
    "these proceedings reviews our study of the effects scale evolution has on dps correlations @xcite . for the numerical results presented in these proceedings we have used the homogeneous evolution equation . to solve the evolution equations numerically , we use a modified version of the code originally described in @xcite .",
    "a number of arguments suggest an interplay between the dependence of dpds on the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath14 @xmath15 of the partons , as well as between their momentum fractions and their relative transverse distance @xmath10 @xcite .    in this section",
    "we study the impact of evolution on the correlations between the momentum fractions and the interparton distance , for this purpose we need a model for the dpds at the starting scale of evolution .",

    "we next investigate the evolution of spin correlations between two partons inside a proton . for this purpose we assume a multiplicative @xmath13 dependence of the dpds , @xmath44 as our focus is on the degree of parton polarization rather than on the absolute size of the dpds , we set @xmath45 . for the unpolarized dpds",
    "we take a simple factorizing ansatz at the starting scale ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 the single parton densities used will be either of the two lo sets mstw 2008 @xcite and gjr 08 @xcite .    to model the polarized dpds is more difficult .",
    "there is no reason to believe that a decomposition of a polarized dpd , which describes the spin correlations between two partons , into polarized pdfs , describing the spin correlations between the proton and a parton , should be suitable even as a starting point .",
    "instead in the scenario presented in these proceedings , we make use of the positivity bounds for dpds derived in @xcite . at the starting scale @xmath34 of evolution ,",

    "they do not mix with gluons under evolution , nor with quarks or antiquarks of different flavors .",
    "figure  [ fig : trans - u - max ] shows the dpd for transversely polarized up quarks and antiquarks . there is a small decrease of the dpd with @xmath39 over the entire @xmath8 range , but the suppression of the degree of polarization is mainly due to the increase in the unpolarized distributions .",
    "the evolution of the degree of polarization is similar to the case of longitudinal polarization , with a somewhat faster decrease . at intermediate and large @xmath8 values ,",
    "the degree of polarization decreases slowly .",

    "gluons can be polarized longitudinally or linearly .",
    "the unpolarized ( single or double ) gluon density increases rapidly at small momentum fractions due to the @xmath56 behavior of the gluon splitting kernel .",
    "the absence of this low-@xmath29 enhancement in the polarized gluon splitting kernels lead us to expect that the degree of gluon polarization will vanish rapidly in the small @xmath29 region .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : long - ggjr - max ] for longitudinally polarized gluons , this is indeed the case .",
    "the distribution @xmath57 does increase with evolution scale , but at a much lower rate than @xmath58 .",
    "evolution quickly suppresses the degree of longitudinal gluon polarization in the small @xmath8 region .",
    "the degree of polarization at at @xmath52 amounts to a degree of polarization equal to 30% and almost 20% at @xmath53 for @xmath54 , with a very weak dependence on @xmath49 .",
    "our knowledge of the single gluon distribution at the low scale remains poor , and using as an alternative to the gjr distributions the mstw set the degree of polarization is reduced to around half the size or below .",
    "linearly polarized gluons give rise to azimuthal asymmetries in dps cross sections @xcite .",
    "the effect of evolution on the distribution of two linearly polarized gluons is shown in figure  [ fig : lin - g - max ] .",
    "we see that even the polarized distribution @xmath59 itself decreases with the scale .",
    "together with the rapid increase of the unpolarized two - gluon dpd this results in a rapid decrease of the degree of linear polarization , especially at small @xmath8 . as in the case of longitudinal gluon polarization , using the mstw distributions at the starting scale results in an even faster suppression . in that case",
    "the degree of polarization is tiny already at @xmath52 .",
    "we conclude that the correlation between two linearly polarized gluons is quickly washed out by evolution and can only be relevant at rather large @xmath8 or rather low scales .",
