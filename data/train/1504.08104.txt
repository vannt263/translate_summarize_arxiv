    "the two symmetry reductions are likely to couple .",

    "[ aboveandbelow ] shows the fourier transforms of the oscillations above and below the putative spin - flop transition , for the narrow angle range over which oscillations were observed on both sides of the transition . on the high - field side of the transition ,",
    "the oscillations have lower amplitudes and the main peak a higher frequency .",
    "( the reduction in amplitude may not be immediately apparent in the figure , but normally quantum oscillation amplitudes grow rapidly as the field is increased , and the reduction in amplitude is very clear in the raw data . )      we now give further details on the reconstruction .",
    "the first step is to determine the misalignment , if any , between the sample and the field angle sensor mounted on the rotator platform .",
    "this misalignment is determined , for sample # 1 , by comparison of the observed @xmath34 frequencies and the scaled pdcoo@xmath0 frequencies , shown in fig .",
    "[ frequencies ] .",
    "the best match is obtained when a @xmath77 offset is added to the measured field angle .",
    "this is our misalignment , and correction for it is incorporated into all plots of sample # 1 frequencies presented in this paper .",
    "we take the nonmagnetic fermi surface to be the parametrised pdcoo@xmath0 fermi surface that was determined in ref .",
    "the parameters specifying the fermi surface are the radius of a circular , cylindrical base fermi surface , @xmath78 , and then the amplitudes of the corrugations on this base .",
    "@xmath79 , for example , is the amplitude of the hexagonal distortion .",
    "@xmath80 sets the difference between the radii of the neck and belly orbits .",
    "a thorough description of this system of parametrization is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we allow three parameters to be adjusted , within small ranges that are consistent with experiment , to match the overall levels of the observed pdcro@xmath0 frequencies .",
    "we emphasize that this adjustment only tunes the overall levels , and does not substantially alter any of the substructure .",
    "these parameters are : ( 1 ) the overall size of the fermi surface ( @xmath78 ) , ( 2 ) the magnitude of the hexagonal distortion ( @xmath79 ) , and ( 3 ) the in - plane lattice constant , @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath16-dependent fermi surface corrugations ( @xmath80 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 ) are left fixed at the amplitudes found for pdcoo@xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath79 is adjusted , the higher - order amplitudes @xmath84 and @xmath85 are adjusted by hand in response , to smooth the faces and sharpen the corners of the fermi surface so as to match the fermi surfaces observed by arpes .",
    "@xcite    the best match is found with @xmath86  @xmath87 , @xmath88  @xmath87 , and @xmath89   .",
    "further refinement ( for example by allowing a low - temperature lattice distortion , or modification of the @xmath16-dependent corrugations , or finite avoided crossings ) might yield slightly different results the obtained lattice parameter , for example , is not precisely in line with expectations , as it has been measured to be 2.923   at room temperature and some thermal contraction is expected .",
    "@xcite but these fitting parameters are within bounds permitted by experiment and are adequate to model the angle dependence .",
    "in addition to the reconstruction shown in the main text , we tested two further possibilities .",
    "the first is the same reconstruction but with the other possible orientation relative to the field rotation plane , that the glide plane is rotated from the field rotation plane by @xmath13 .",
    "the second tests a hypothetical magnetic zone with vertical side walls , that would preserve the @xmath90 symmetry of the nonmagnetic lattice .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ matchingthefrequencies_appendix ] .",
    "the rotated reconstruction , shown in the left - hand panels in fig .  [ matchingthefrequencies_appendix ] , gives a reasonable match to the data , but not as good as with the glide and rotation planes aligned : it yields the wrong sign on the slope of @xmath45 against @xmath37 , and too low an amplitude on the substructure of the @xmath46 frequencies .",
    "the @xmath19 reconstruction gives a worse match : although it reproduces the @xmath48 and @xmath45 frequencies reasonably well , it does not reproduce the structure on @xmath46 at all .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the magnetic reconstruction illustrated in figs .",
    "[ 3dreconstruction ] and [ matchingthefrequencies ] is the correct one ."

    "<S> we report quantum oscillation data on the metallic triangular antiferromagnet pdcro@xmath0 . we find that , to very high accuracy , the observed frequencies of pdcro@xmath0 can be reproduced by reconstruction of the ( nonmagnetic ) pdcoo@xmath0 fermi surface into a reduced zone . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced zone corresponds to a magnetic cell containing six chromium sites , giving a @xmath1 in - plane reconstruction , and @xmath2 interplane reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> the interplane ordering represents a reduction in lattice symmetry , possibly to monoclinic , and an associated lattice distortion is expected . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we report a magnetic transition under an applied in - plane field that is probably equivalent to the spin - flop transition reported for cucro@xmath0 , and present data on its field - angle dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we also report measurements of the resistivity of pdcro@xmath0 up to 500  k.    magnetic ions coordinated on a triangular lattice often yield interesting magnetic properties . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent example is the insulating cro@xmath0 sheet , stabilised in materials like licro@xmath0 and pdcro@xmath0 . in these compounds , </S>",
    "<S> the cr formal charge is @xmath3 , and its configuration is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal field at the cr sites is nearly octahedral , inducing a gap between the quasi-@xmath5 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) and quasi-@xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) bands . </S>",
    "<S> the quasi-@xmath5 levels are therefore half - filled , and the cro@xmath0 sheet is a mott insulator : strong hund s rule coupling aligns the spins on each cr site , giving a total spin on each cr site of nearly @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the cro@xmath0 sheet is a heisenberg system , that orders at low temperatures into the @xmath13 triangular nel phase .    of materials containing such a cro@xmath0 sheet , agcro@xmath0 , cucro@xmath0 , and pdcro@xmath0 have the delafossite crystal structure , while licro@xmath0 , nacro@xmath0 , and kcro@xmath0 have the closely - related ordered rock salt structure . </S>",
    "<S> all of these systems show @xmath13 order , with the nel temperature depending strongly on the cr - cr spacing . </S>",
    "<S> the ordered rock salt structure gives substantially smaller interplane spacings than the delafossite structure , and somewhat higher nel temperatures .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the interlayer order is a more subtle problem than the intralayer order : in all of these systems the cr sheets are stacked rhombohedrally , so the molecular fields from first- and second - neighbouring layers cancel . </S>",
    "<S> however the interlayer order has observable consequences : agcro@xmath0 and cucro@xmath0 show spin - driven ferroelectricity , while nacro@xmath0 and licro@xmath0 do not .  @xcite agcro@xmath0 and cucro@xmath0 have the delafossite structure and nacro@xmath0 and licro@xmath0 the ordered rock salt structure , but the more essential difference appears to be the interlayer order : in agcro@xmath0  @xcite and cucro@xmath0  @xcite , the interlayer ordering is ferroic , in that the vector chirality , the rotational sense of the spin helices that comprise the @xmath13 phase , is the same in all layers . in licro@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , neutron scattering data suggest that the vector chirality alternates from layer to layer  @xcite , while the interplane order of nacro@xmath0 is not clear .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    this paper focuses on pdcro@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the nel temperature of pdcro@xmath0 is @xmath14  k , and , like licro@xmath0 , the vector chirality probably alternates from layer to layer ,  @xcite so this feature is not restricted to the ordered rock salt structure .    whereas the other compounds discussed above are insulators , pdcro@xmath0 is a metal , due to @xmath15 conduction in the pd sheets . </S>",
    "<S> the isostructural , nonmagnetic compound pdcoo@xmath0 also has these pd sheets , and its carrier mobility was found to exceed that of copper .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite pdcro@xmath0 therefore is an interesting system , comprised of highly - conducting sheets interleaved with mott insulating spacer layers </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to determine whether the metallic pd conduction has any effect on the magnetic order .    </S>",
    "<S> what is certainly true is that the pd conduction can be used as a probe of the magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> quantum oscillation  @xcite and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite studies have shown that the pdcro@xmath0 fermi surfaces result from reconstruction of the pdcoo@xmath0 fermi surface into the magnetic zone . </S>",
    "<S> observation of an unconventional anomalous hall effect in pdcro@xmath0 indicates further that the cr spins are not co - planar .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in this paper we present measurements of quantum oscillations in pdcro@xmath0 , and confirm the overall frequencies reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we add greater resolution and a careful comparison with the nonmagnetic pdcoo@xmath0 fermi surface : we show that reconstruction of the pdcoo@xmath0 fermi surface reproduces most of the observed oscillation frequencies to very high accuracy ; the pdcro@xmath0 frequencies can be analyzed in detail without recourse to density functional theory calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the magnetic coupling is @xmath16-dependent : it is much weaker at @xmath17 than at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> also , the dominant magnetic scattering vectors are those corresponding to a 6-cr magnetic unit cell giving a @xmath2 interplane reconstruction in addition to the @xmath1 in - plane reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> the interplane order represents a reduction in lattice symmetry , from @xmath19 ( rhombohedral ) to , in the highest - symmetry case , @xmath20 ( monoclinic ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we also report a magnetic transition under applied field , at a similar field to a spin flop transition reported in cucro@xmath0 , that was observed in the course of measurement of the oscillations . finally , we present measurements of the resistivity of pdcro@xmath0 to high temperatures . </S>"
