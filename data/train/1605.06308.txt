    "the mathematical models which describe the diffusion of technological innovations belong to a category of diffusion and contagion models applicable to several phenomena and to different social structures .",
    "frequent applications are , for instance , epidemics ( of real diseases or computer viruses ) , spreading of information and rumors , opinion dynamics , marketing strategies for consumer products which take into account positive and negative word of mouth , etc .",
    "these models typically consider a society composed by individuals who interact and communicate in various possible ways and can be in different `` states '' with respect to the diffusing phenomenon , while certain probabilities are assigned to pass from each state to another state . in the case of an epidemic , for instance",
    ", each individual can be assumed to be sound , infected or recovered / immunized ; in the case of information diffusion each individual can be ignorant or informed , and informed people can act either as spreaders or as `` stiflers '' ( persons who are informed but , for some reason , are not willing to pass the information on ) .",
    "usually the variables of the phenomenon are the normalized populations of the states , to be investigated as functions of time .",
    "the populations obey systems of differential equations ; one is interested into the solutions of these equations at finite time ( with characteristic evolution timescales which are often relevant to the problem ) , or into the `` asymptotic '' solutions at large time .",
    "less frequently , periodic solutions are of interest , like for instance in the case of epidemics with cyclical outbursts .",
    "the differential equations are typically non - linear , because they need to include interaction terms describing the encounters between individuals , whose probabilities are proportional to both the populations of the respective states .",
    "the main established tool for a mathematical description of the diffusion of technological innovations is the so - called bass differential equation @xcite .",
    "using this equation in conjunction with large empirical databases of statistical parameters , the experts of marketing and technology are able to make predictions about innovation processes in different kinds of markets .",
    "in particular , the diffusion rate of an innovation and the peak number of adoptions can be estimated with good accuracy .",
    "the advantage of this method lies in its power and flexibility , also due to the fact that it is based on a differential equation and not on agent - based simulations .",
    "also mathematical methods , however , need to be constantly improved , in order to reflect the evolving global features of the technology market , the development of new information channels and the fragmentation of society into several sectors which are more or less open to innovation .",
    "in fact , several improved versions of the bass equation have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the application of these techniques to the study of the diffusion of innovations has been historically accompanied by a wide qualitative and empirical literature , which includes subjects ranging from marketing strategy and industrial organization , to the sociological / medical studies concerning the diffusion of medical practices , contraception and prevention , introduction of innovative legislation , new didactic methods etc . @xcite .",
    "classical works like those by rogers @xcite also contain ample reference to agricultural practices , diffusion of new sort of crops or farming machines , with adoption at the level of the single individuals or of entire organizations .",
    "concepts which have been introduced more recently include the distinction between `` sustaining innovations '' and `` disruptive innovations '' @xcite , and the idea of `` indigenous innovation '' @xcite as compared to the science - driven innovation theorized by schumpeter .    already in the 1990 s seminal papers like",
    "@xcite have highlighted the role of networks in the diffusion of innovation and information .",
    "these works , however , did not take advantage of the progress in network theory which took place a few years later .",
    "an important reference point for our work is the theoretical framework developed by vespignani et al . for the statistical description of networks @xcite .",
    "these methods have been originally employed to analyze the diffusion of epidemics , and thus with a focus on different aspects , but then have found applications also for diffusion of information and innovation @xcite .",
    "a recent influential work is that by watts and dodds @xcite .",
    "they studied the effect on diffusion of a category of individuals called `` influencers '' , who do not belong to the media business or other organizations , but are simply well - connected and able to influence ( in some more or less well - defined sense ) the choices of others .",
    "watts and dodds apply agent - based simulations running specific diffusion models ( including the bass model ) to the structure of some real social networks .",
    "our approach is different and more theoretical .",
    "we write ( large ) systems of differential equations which generalize the bass model to various networks with power - law degree distribution , on the assumption , based on empirical work ( see for instance di matteo et al . @xcite and the references therein ) , that the social networks involved in the diffusion of innovation are of this kind .    in the next section",
    "we shall discuss the characterization of the diffusion curve as an `` s - curve '' with variable steepness .",
    "a general parametrization of s - curves has been given by ghanbarnejad et al .",
    "in the context of linguistic innovation @xcite . among the recent works on diffusion on networks ,",
    "particularly significant are the exact solutions by gleeson @xcite and the methods of mccullen et al .",
    "rahmandad and sterman @xcite offer a detailed comparison between agent - based and differential equation models and argue that differential equation models are typically unsuitable for the representation of heterogeneous agents ; our method represents a progress under this respect .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sect .  [ structure ]",
    "we introduce our general framework for the formulation of the bass equation on a generic network through the statistical link density @xmath5 and the correlation functions @xmath6 .",
    "we define the partial cumulative adoption function referred to the single link classes and replace the homogeneous imitation term of the original bass equation with a sum of terms describing the imitation between individuals belonging to different link classes .",
    "we take into account the correlation functions and the condition of constant average connectivity , in order to allow comparison with different networks and with the original bass model ( to which , for brevity , we also refer throughout the paper as to the homogeneous model ) . in sect .",
    "[ steep ] we introduce a parameter which measures the steepness of the s - curve @xmath7 through the ratio between height and width at half - height of the graph of its derivative @xmath8 . in sect .",
    "[ results ] we discuss the results of numerical solutions with uncorrelated networks ( obtained with standard runge - kutta methods ) , in particular the dependence of the peak time @xmath9 on the power - law exponent @xmath2 and its relation to the peak time @xmath10 of the most connected individuals . in sect .  [ ad ] we consider networks with assortative and disassortative correlations .",
    "we develop a method for the explicit construction of the corresponding correlation matrices and discuss its applicability .",
    "results of the numerical solutions are compared to those for uncorrelated networks . in sect .",
    "[ pvariabile ] we introduce link - dependent publicity terms @xmath11 , weighted in such a way that the advertising is targeted on the hubs , with the same total cost .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations are compared to those with homogeneous advertising .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ conc ] comprises our conclusions and a summary of the main results .",
    "the bass equation has the form @xmath12\\left [ { p + qf(t ) } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the cumulative fraction of adopters at the time @xmath13 , measured in years .",
    "for instance , if at @xmath14 we have @xmath15 , this means that after 4 years 70% of the potential adopters have actually adopted the innovation .",
    "the function @xmath16 has a characteristic `` leaning s '' shape and approaches 1 at large times .",
    "the derivative @xmath17 is the adoption probability in an interval of one year .",
    "its graph exhibits a maximum called the peak of innovation diffusion .",
    "producers of the innovation are clearly interested into forecasts of this peak .",
    "the `` publicity '' parameter @xmath18 gives the probability per year of adoptions entirely due to the effect of advertising , while the `` imitation parameter '' @xmath19 , multiplied by the fraction @xmath16 of actual adopters , gives the conditioned probability per year of adoptions due to word - of - mouth effects . in the example above , if @xmath20 , in the 5th year the equation predicts the adoption rate due to imitation to be 8.4% of the potential adopters .",
    "a possible improvement of the bass model is the introduction of classes of individuals who have more or less numerous links with others , with a corresponding dynamics on a network .    in order to introduce a network structure",
    "we proceed at first by analogy with the equations for the diffusion of epidemics and rumors .",
    "the first step is a statistical / probabilistic characterization of the network .",
    "this clearly has some limitations in comparison with a complete characterization through the adiacency matrix @xmath21 ( for which the indices run over all nodes of the network )",
    ". we shall discuss later whether the information about the higher - order correlations contained in @xmath21 can be inserted into the differential equations ; until now , this has only been done for linear equations or for agent - based models . on the other hand , the statistical description of the network allows to summarize its mean features in a relatively small number of parameters , namely the link density @xmath5 ( the fraction of nodes having @xmath22 links , where @xmath23 and @xmath3 is the maximum number of links one node can have ) , and the correlation functions @xmath24 , which give the conditioned probability that an individual with @xmath25 links is connected to one with @xmath22 links .    in the quadratic imitation term of the bass equation ,",
    "an homogeneous mixing is understood , i.e. , each individual is supposed to have the same probability to meet any other individual . in the context of statistical mechanics ,",
    "this is also called the `` molecular chaos hypothesis '' . in a real society",
    "the probability of the encounters depends on the network of social relationships , which in turn defines the matrices @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the imitation term will become in the @xmath25-th equation a sum of the form @xmath27 , where we have supposed that the total population is subdivided into @xmath3 `` link classes '' indexed by @xmath28 , with populations @xmath29 .",
    "in other words , @xmath29 denotes the fraction of the total population composed by individuals with @xmath25 links to other individuals , who at the time @xmath13 have adopted the innovation . admitting that , in the end , all individuals will adopt",
    ", we will have @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "it is convenient to define the quantities @xmath32 , representing the fraction of potential adopters with @xmath25 links that at the time @xmath13 have actually adopted the innovation .",
    "it is worth recalling here that the strategy of generalizing the evolution equations of some system by considering variables which group nodes with the same degree is referred to in the recent literature as  heterogeneous mean - field approach \" @xcite .",
    "let us give a simple numerical example .",
    "suppose there are only 4 link classes , with number of links equal to 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , respectively , and assume a link density of the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a normalization constant ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "it is immediate to see that @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "now , if at the time @xmath13 we have for instance @xmath40 , @xmath41 , this means that at that time 50% of the individuals with 1 link ( corresponding to 24% of the total population ) have adopted , and 75% of the individuals with 2 links ( corresponding to 18% of the total population ) have adopted .    with these notations the network bass equation becomes a system of non - linear first order differential equations @xmath42\\left [ { p + iq\\sum\\limits_{h = 1}^n { p(h|i){g_h}(t ) } } \\right ] \\qquad",
    "i=1, ... ,n \\label{bassnet}\\ ] ] with initial conditions @xmath43 .",
    "the factor @xmath44 on the r.h.s .",
    "shows that the asymptotic value of the functions @xmath45 will be @xmath46 , as expected .",
    "we can easily solve these equations numerically and plot the solutions , after fixing the link density @xmath47 and the correlations @xmath48 .",
    "in the plots we re - introduce the quantities @xmath29 , @xmath49 , for a more direct comparison with the original bass equation .",
    "note that the matrices @xmath47 , @xmath48 must obey the network closure condition ( ncc ) @xmath50 further conditions are normalizations @xmath51 , @xmath52 and positivity @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "a first interesting check is the dependence of the diffusion phenomenon on the exponent @xmath2 for a network with link density @xmath55 .",
    "this can be a meaningful check only if the average number of links per individual is kept fixed as @xmath2 varies .",
    "a proper question is , for instance : if in a certain network individuals have , on average , 2 links , is the diffusion faster when everyone has exactly or almost exactly 2 links , like in a random network with distribution sharply centered around @xmath25=2 ? or is the diffusion faster when there are a few individuals with many more than 2 links , and a lot of individuals with just 1 link ?",
    "networks with link density of the form @xmath55 , where @xmath1 have been the object during the last few decades of intense investigation ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "due to an invariance property of their degree distribution , they are also known as scale - free networks , even if this terminology is most frequently reserved for those of them which have exponent in the range @xmath56 , which are frequently occurring in the real world .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 of a network with power - law degree distribution gives a measure of this inequality : when @xmath2 is large , the number of hubs is very small .",
    "the average number of links per node in a network is @xmath57 therefore , in order to compare the results obtained with different @xmath2 we must normalize the @xmath19-coefficient in the network bass equation ( [ bassnet ] ) with this factor . the simplest way to assign",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath48 is to consider at first uncorrelated networks , for which @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath48 is independent from @xmath25 .",
    "this matrix @xmath48 satisfies automatically the ncc condition for any @xmath2",
    ". we shall consider later the case of correlated networks of the assortative or disassortative kind .",
    "now we solve the equation system ( [ bassnet ] ) for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "we choose as single parameter characterizing the diffusion process the time @xmath9 of the peak in the diffusion rate ( the peak of the sales , in marketing applications ) .",
    "this is the maximum of the function @xmath60 which gives the total rate of new adoptions summed over all link classes .      the bass density function @xmath8 describing the number of new adoptions in the unity of time is @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the adoption peak occurs at the time @xmath64 , with @xmath65 .",
    "denoting by @xmath66 and @xmath67 the instants when @xmath68 , one obtains @xmath69 let us denote by @xmath70 the ratio between the height of the peak and its width at half - height .",
    "we find @xmath71 this ratio depends , of course , on the time unity ( the standard unit is years , in the bass model ) .    for comparison recall that , for instance , in the sequence of approximations of the dirac delta @xmath72 ( derivatives of the smoothed step functions @xmath73 ) one has @xmath74 , @xmath75 and therefore @xmath76 .",
    "in our case , the values of @xmath9 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 are obtained numerically with the desired approximation by sampling the numerical solution for @xmath79 .     as a function of time ( blue curve ) , for an uncorrelated network with density proportional to @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , with @xmath82 .",
    "the violet curve is the simple bass function with the same @xmath19 and @xmath18 ( @xmath20 , @xmath83 ) .",
    "the function @xmath84 peaks approx .  at @xmath85 , while the simple bass function peaks approx .  at @xmath86.,width=377,height=226 ]    .",
    "the function which has the largest value at @xmath87 is @xmath88 , representing the adoptions of individuals with only 1 link .",
    "the function @xmath89 , which represents the adoptions of the most connected individuals , peaks approx .  at @xmath90.,width=377,height=226 ]      as shown in tab .",
    "[ peaks ] , the peak time @xmath9 of the new adoptions decreases when the exponent @xmath2 grows , that is , when the network contains less hubs with more links . for @xmath81 , @xmath9 is about 2/3 of the diffusion peak time of the homogeneous bass curve with the same average connectivity .",
    "therefore the network structure has a considerable acceleration effect on the diffusion process .",
    "this effect appears to reverse , however , when @xmath2 reaches the values 5/2 .",
    ".time of adoption peak for different values of the power - law exponent @xmath2 in the case of uncorrelated networks .",
    "@xmath9 is the total adoption time , @xmath10 is the partial adoption time of the most connected individuals , belonging to the class with @xmath3 links . here",
    "@xmath70 is the peak steepness , namely the ratio between its height and its width at half - height . the homogeneous bass function with the same @xmath19 and @xmath18 ( @xmath20 , @xmath83 ) peaks approx .",
    "at @xmath86 and has steepness @xmath91 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that although the criterion of inverse proportionality @xmath92 allows to leave the total advertising cost unchanged , this is not the only possible choice .",
    "one could as well look for strategies allowing a diminution of advertising cost with an acceptable slowing down of diffusion , or viceversa , in some cases it may be preferable to spend more in advertising in order to obtain a faster diffusion .",
    "the advantage of an analytical model is that these parameters can easily be tuned and their effect immediately checked , see in this connection the fig .",
    "[ t_of - gamma ] . also the parameters describing the diffusion process can be chosen in a different way ; the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath70 can be replaced by other measures of diffusion , like for instance diffusion percentiles etc .     of the total diffusion peak time @xmath9 and of the partial diffusion peak time @xmath93 ( for individuals with 50 links ) in a network with largest degree @xmath4 , in the uncorrelated and assortative case .",
    "the peak time @xmath93 has been chosen as indicator of the anticipated diffusion in the hubs , instead of @xmath94 , because in these networks the hubs with 100 links are a very small fraction of the total population , and thus are not significant for statistical monitoring . nevertheless , the anticipation effect is clearly very strong , especially for the assortative networks : for @xmath81 , @xmath93 is approx . 20% of @xmath9 , and for @xmath95 it is approx .",
    "10 % of @xmath9 .",
    "note that for uncorrelated networks the total diffusion time is smaller , but the anticipation effect is weaker .",
    "the dependence @xmath96 in the case of variable @xmath18 coefficients is also shown.,width=491,height=188 ]",
    "in this work we have developed a network version of the bass diffusion equation in the statistical network formalism introduced by boguna et al .",
    "@xcite for the study of epidemics on scale - free networks .",
    "the main technical aspects of our approach are the following :    1 .   an appropriate definition of link classes and relative adoption rates , with normalization of the average connectivity for comparison to the homogeneous bass equation ; 2 .   the definition of a measure of the steepness of the s - curve of diffusion , to be employed in conjunction with the diffusion peak time in the analysis of numerical solutions ; 3 .   a generalization of the imitation term , obtained through the consideration of the probabilities of encounters between members of the link classes , expressed by the correlation coefficients @xmath6 ; 4 .   the explicit construction of correlation matrices of the assortative and disassortative type in any dimension , addressed to allow comparisons between the assortative , disassortative and uncorrelated case ; 5 .   a generalization of the publicity term achieved by considering the possibility of a `` weighted '' advertising campaign aimed at accelerating diffusion among the hubs and consequently among the entire population",
    "the main results which can be inferred from the numerical solutions of the model are the following :    1 .   in the uncorrelated case ,",
    "the peak time of the total adoptions decreases steadily when the power - law exponent @xmath2 of the network grows from 1/4 ( almost - homogeneous network ) to 2 ( network with few , much connected hubs ) ; then the peak time grows in the interval @xmath97 .",
    "the peak time in the adoptions of the hubs decreases in the whole interval @xmath98 .",
    "this means that by monitoring the hubs it is always possible , in principle , to predict the peak of the total adoptions .",
    "also , this can be done more effectively when the hubs are few and much connected .",
    "the prediction requires the numerical solution of the differential equations and the previous knowledge of the parameter @xmath2 ; this is , however , a statistical parameter , which can be estimated without a complete mapping of the network .",
    "3 .   the presence of assortative correlations may accelerate diffusion , while the presence of disassortative correlations , where applicable , slows it down . specifically , with reference to large networks ( @xmath4 ) in the scale - free range @xmath99 ( fig .",
    "[ t_of - gamma ] ) , the numerical solutions show that the total diffusion time is larger ( with respect to uncorrelated networks ) , but the anticipation effect is stronger .",
    "the presence of advertising targeted on the hubs may further accelerate diffusion and improve the monitoring functions of the hubs .",
    "for instance , with @xmath100 the diffusion peak time of the hubs is less than 40% of the total peak time ( in a case with @xmath82 , @xmath20 , @xmath83 ) .",
    "however , for large networks in the scale - free range @xmath99 the  anticipation \" effect of the hubs is absent and when @xmath2 approaches 3 , targeted advertising becomes less efficient than homogeneous advertising ( fig .",
    "[ t_of - gamma ] ) .    finally , we point out that the best set of real data presently available for a comparison with our model is reported by goldenberg et al .",
    "@xcite who have analyzed the diffusion of some online services in a large korean social network with @xmath101 million users . after identifying the network hubs and finding a scale - free degree distribution , the authors of @xcite measured several quantities related to the total speed of the adoption process , to hub and non - hub adoption timing and to hub adoption as predictor of total adoption timing .",
    "the results are generally in agreement with the dynamics predicted by our model . a simple regression analysis and comparison with the homogeneous bass model is also given in @xcite .",
    "the main focus of the work , however , is on marketing aspects .",
    "a more detailed comparison of our model with real data would require a dedicated data collection , which is among our future plans .",
