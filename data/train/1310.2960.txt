    "a mimo radar array system employs multiple transmit antennas for emitting orthogonal waveforms and multiple receive antennas for receiving the echoes reflected by the targets @xcite and can exploit the waveform diversity to form a virtual array with increased degrees of freedom ( dofs ) and a larger aperture compared to the traditional phased - array radar .",
    "it has been shown that mimo radar can provide enhanced spatial resolution , achieve better target detection performance , and significantly improve the system s parameter identifiability @xcite .",
    "many techniques have been proposed for angle estimation in mimo radar using traditional direction of arrival ( doa ) algorithms , such as music @xcite and esprit  @xcite , by assuming perfect knowledge of the array manifold .",
    "however , these algorithms are sensitive to uncertainties in the array manifold , and their performance will degrade significantly in the presence of array model errors  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is time - consuming and expensive to calibrate the system in the case of large or time - varying arrays @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is observed that in practice , even after initial calibration , antenna gain and phase errors still exist due to environmental changes and other factors @xcite . to cope with the problem , in @xcite ,",
    "a music - based doa estimation method in the presence of gain and phase errors was introduced . a subspace - based method for estimating the errors was proposed in @xcite .",
    "other methods were also proposed based on partially calibrated arrays @xcite .",
    "additionally , blind calibration is possible for non - gaussian signals by using higher - order statistics @xcite , although with a very high computational complexity .    in this work ,",
    "we address the problem of joint doa and array manifold estimation with a multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) array configuration  @xcite , where only two transmit antennas are fully calibrated , while the receive antennas are uncalibrated  @xcite .",
    "since the two transmit antennas transmit orthogonal waveforms , we can extract the received data associated with each transmit antenna .",
    "with the two transmit antennas well calibrated , a rotational invariance property between the two sets of data can still be maintained without any knowledge of the array manifold of the uncalibrated side ; then the esprit algorithm can be used to find the initial doas of the targets .",
    "starting with the initial doa estimates , the antenna gains and phases can then be estimated through an appropriate modification of the music algorithm introduced in @xcite .",
    "the estimated antenna gains and phases will be used in the more accurate estimation of doas via the music algorithm .",
    "this procedure will be repeated until some convergence criterion is met .",
    "the advantage of the scheme is that only two calibrated antennas are needed for high resolution doa estimation and no specific requirement is imposed on the uncalibrated antennas . to our best knowledge",
    ", none of the existing doa estimation methods for mimo arrays has considered the joint doa and array manifold estimation problem .",

    "consider a mimo system with a uniform linear array ( ula ) of @xmath0 antennas used for both transmitting and receiving .",
    "for simplicity of notation and without loss of generality , we assume that the first two antennas are perfectly calibrated .",

    "let @xmath31 be the subset of @xmath25 , which relates to the first to the @xmath32-th transmit antennas , and @xmath33 be the subset of @xmath25 , which relates to the second to the @xmath0-th transmit antennas .",
    "we then have the following relationship @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an unknown nonsingular matrix and @xmath36 is a diagonal matrix , with its @xmath11th main diagonal element being @xmath37 .",

    "@xmath25 have a relationship determined by a unique nonsingular matrix @xmath45 as @xmath46    define @xmath47 and @xmath48 as the first and second @xmath0 rows of @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "we have @xmath49 then , @xmath50 now using the traditional esprit technique , the main diagonal elements of @xmath43 can be obtained via eigendecomposition of @xmath51 .",
    "since the two transmit antennas have been well calibrated , @xmath52 can be obtained easily from @xmath43 .",
    "note that the rotational invariance property exploited here depends only on the two calibrated transmit antennas and is not related to the uncalibrated part .",
    "thus , the initial doas can be estimated accurately without any knowledge of array model errors .",
    "additionally , in this initial doa estimation , the proposed esprit - based method imposes less constraints on the spacing of the uncalibrated part , which can be arranged to be much larger than a half - wavelength for a high - resolution doa estimation .        using the estimates ( [ eq15 ] )",
    ", the doas can be estimated from the @xmath8 highest peaks of the following function : @xmath73[\\bar{\\textbf{a}}(\\theta)\\otimes\\bar{\\textbf{a}}(\\theta)]\\big]^h\\textbf{u}_n\\textbf{u}_{n}^h\\big[\\mathrm{diag}[\\delta][\\bar{\\textbf{a}}(\\theta)\\otimes\\bar{\\textbf{a}}(\\theta)]\\big ] }        \\label{eq16}.\\ ] ] since a set of initial doa estimates has already been obtained , we can search for each doa estimate over a small doa region corresponding to each initial doa estimate .",
    "thus , the inter - element spacing of the uncalibrated array does not have to be smaller than half wavelength to avoid estimation ambiguity .",
    "actually , we can increase the inter - element spacing of the uncalibrated array to improve the accuracy of estimation .",
    "the proposed joint doa and array manifold estimation scheme is summarized as follows :    \\1 ) estimate the initial doas using the esprit algorithm .",
    "\\2 ) estimate the array manifold using ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "\\3 ) use the results in step 2 to find updated doas by local searching through ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "\\4 ) repeat steps 2 and 3 until some convergence criterion is satisfied .",
    "one such a criterion could be the difference between the estimation results of the last round and the current one .",
    "when this difference is smaller than a pre - set threshold value , we can then stop the iteration .",
    "note that we have assumed implicitly that the antenna positions have been calibrated , and we consider the fixed uncalibrated gain and phase errors only .",
    "this is because the calibration of array position is more convenient than the calibration of gain and phase which may vary due to environmental changes . on the other hand",
    ", the position error can be transformed into phase errors . however , the phase errors caused by position errors are not fixed for the targets because the targets have different doas . in such a case ,",
    "a simple way is to obtain the gain and phase errors corresponding to each target , i.e. we should estimate the gain and phase errors when obtaining one target s doa other than all the doas .      to estimate the sample covariance matrix , a computational complexity of @xmath74",
    "is needed .",
    "the eigendecomposition operation needs a computational complexity of @xmath75 .",
    "the proposed esprit requires a computational complexity of @xmath76 . in the estimation of array manifold ,",
    "the computational complexity of @xmath77 is needed , where @xmath78 is the iteration number .",
