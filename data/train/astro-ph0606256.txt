    "chandra x - ray observatory and hubble space telescope observations have established that x - ray and optical emission from kpc - scale radio jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are common ( e.g. stawarz 2003 ) . in quasars , the x - rays are widely interpreted as inverse compton ( ic ) scattered emission off the cmb by electrons in the jet emitting synchrotron radiation at very low radio frequencies ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ; celotti et al . 2001 ) .",
    "if this is the dominant x - ray production mechanism , it implies quasar jets have large bulk velocities ( lorentz factors , @xmath0@xmath1315 ) on the observed 10 s  100 s kpc - scale , so that the electrons in the jet frame see a sufficiently boosted source of seed photons to explain the x - rays .",
    "a natural consequence of the ic / cmb model is that high - z quasars should have prominent x - ray jets ( schwartz 2002a ) because of the strong dependence of the cmb energy density on redshift : @xmath2 u@xmath3@xmath4(1+z)@xmath5 .",
    "the recent detection of a bright x - ray jet in the z=4.3 quasar gb  1508 + 5714 ( yuan et al .",
    "2003 , siemiginowska et al .",
    "2003 ) , with only a faint radio counterpart (   2 ) , lends support to this scenario .",
    "this jet sees 12 orders of magnitude times greater energy density from the cmb than jets at lower redshift ( z@xmath62 ) , so its extreme redshift may account , to first order , for its large x - ray to radio luminosity ratio ( cheung 2004 ) . in the framework of the ic / cmb model , variations in @xmath7 and jet doppler factor , @xmath8 , can cause significant spread in the observed @xmath9 ( both along a given jet , and source - to - source ) , and would smear the possible relation with redshift if only a limited redshift - range is studied .",
    "it is important to identify more jets in high - redshift quasars to observe with both chandra and the vla in order to compare with lower - redshift examples .",
    "observations of these systems could help to distinguish between the different models proposed to account for the x - ray emission ",
    "one would not , for instance , expect a z - dependence in the synchrotron x - ray jets .",
    "unfortunately , very little is known about the extended radio structure of high - redshift quasars .",
    "recent chandra imaging of a number of z@xmath104 radio loud quasars do not reveal significant extended x - ray emission ( bassett et al .",
    "2004 ; lopez et al .",
    "2004 ) , although there is no pre - existing information on possible radio structures in these samples .",
    "we recently began a program to search for and study kpc - scale radio jets in high - redshift quasars .",
    "the overall goal of our work is to compile a comparison sample to the x - ray jet detections at lower - redshift to test for a bulk redshift dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "we do not aim for our sample to be a complete one since the lower - z detections are inhomogenous  we require only that our high - z sample be comparable in radio luminosity and that the jets are beamed ( i.e. are flat - spectrum core - dominated quasars ) . ongoing work from this program",
    "is discussed .",
    "the chandra detection of an extended x - ray feature @xmath12.5  from the z=4.3 quasar gb  1508 + 5714 ( hook et al .",
    "1995 ) was reported independently by two groups : siemiginowska et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and yuan et al .",
    "subsequently , a faint radio counterpart ( 1.2 mjy at 1.4 ghz ) to the extended x - ray feature was found ( cheung 2004 ) , supporting the previous authors interpretation of the emission as from a jet associated with the quasar .",
    "this makes gb  1508 + 5714 the most distant quasar with a _ kiloparsec - scale _ jet detected at any wavelength .",
    "the jet knot in gb  1508 + 5714 shows an extremely high monochromatic x - ray to radio luminosity ratio ( @xmath11/@xmath12=158 ) .",
    "this is large in comparison to x - ray jets detected in lower redshift , z@xmath62 core - dominated quasars ( range of @xmath10.250 ) . since this observed ratio is strongly dependent on redshift in the ic / cmb model ( e.g. schwartz 2002a )",
    ", it suggests that this is an important and presumably a dominant x - ray production mechanism in kiloparsec - scale quasar jets ( see cheung 2004 ) .",
    "we have since obtained exploratory time vla b - configuration observations of gb  1508 + 5714 at 4.9 and 8.4 ghz ( program ac728 ) .",
    "a total of @xmath130 minutes integration per frequency was obtained , and the measured off - source rms in the self - calibrated images are within 10@xmath13 of the theoretical noise level of 0.03 mjy / bm .",
    "we measured an inverted radio spectrum ( @xmath14=0.5 @xmath150.1 ; @xmath16 ) for the radio core between 4.98.4 ghz at our observation epoch ( january 2 , 2004 ) .",
    "the extended @xmath12.5  radio feature is confirmed at 5 ghz , where we found a very faint counterpart ( 0.2 @xmath150.04 mjy , a 5@xmath17 detection ; figure  1 ) . with the previous 1.4 ghz detection ,",
    "the 1.45 ghz radio spectral index is 1.4@xmath150.2 , which is very steep in comparison to other radio jet features ( e.g. bridle & perley 1984 ) . extrapolating this spectrum to 8.4 ghz ,",
    "the expected flux density is @xmath10.1 mjy , consistent with our previous limit at this frequency from archival data ( cheung 2004 ) , and non - detection in the new observation ( 5@xmath17=0.2 mjy at the position of the jet ) .",
    "the steep observed radio spectrum is probably due to the fact that we are sampling both higher rest - frame energies ( up to 44 ghz for the 8.4 ghz limit ) and the increased efficiency of radiative losses due to inverse compton scattering on the cosmic microwave background at this high - redshift .",
    "our new measurement of the jet radio spectrum allow us to rule out a single power - law extrapolation of the radio data into the x - ray band , since @xmath18 ( = 0.73 ) , as would be expected in canonical synchrotron models .",
    "if we assume the radio and x - ray emission are produced co - spatially , we can apply a `` one - zone '' synchrotron ( radio ) and ic / cmb ( x - ray ) model ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ) as done previously for this jet ( @xmath19[gb1508 ] ) .",
    "assuming also equipartition between the relativistic particles and magnetic field , we can solve for the doppler factor , @xmath204 , and magnetic field , @xmath2125 @xmath22 g assuming @xmath14=0.9 , the measured x - ray spectral index ( cheung 2004 ) .",
    "this interpretation then demands that we ( or allows us to , depending on one s vantage point ) reconstruct the underlying electron energy spectrum in some detail as follows :    @xmath23 the radio spectrum is steeper than the x - ray one ( @xmath240.9@xmath150.3 ; siemiginowska et al .",
    "2003 , yuan et al .",
    "2003 ) implying a break in the electron energy spectrum of @xmath10.5@xmath150.4 .",
    "@xmath23 the detected ic / cmb x - ray emission is produced by electrons with energy @xmath25 100 - 1000 ( 0.35 kev ) which emit synchrotron radiation at ( unobservable ) radio frequencies of 40 mhz and below .",
    "@xmath23 the x - ray spectral index of 0.9 reveals the intrinsic index of the relativistic electron population before the spectrum drops steeply in the cm - band ( @xmath25 6@xmath2610@xmath27 to 10@xmath5 for 1.4 and 5 ghz ) .",
    "the overall picture is that electrons with energies @xmath25 100 to at least @xmath28 are present , and a break in the spectrum occurs between @xmath2510006000 .",
    "this has important implications for prospects of future multi - wavelength studies of kpc - scale jets :    @xmath23 the lowest energy electrons comptonize cmb photons into the optical band ( @xmath2510 ) .",
    "these electrons dominate the total energy density in the jet and deep hst observations offer a possible probe of their emission which would otherwise be unobservable at sub - mhz frequencies .",
    "@xmath23 the expected flux density of the jet at low radio frequencies ",
    "e.g. 74 mhz  is 17 mjy ( if the spectrum breaks at 1.4 ghz ) and up to 74 mjy ( break at or below 74 mhz ) .",
    "this level of emission will be detectable by the proposed long wavelength array ( lwa ) which will offer arcsecond - resolution at mhz frequencies ( harris 2005 ) .",
    "current vla 74 mhz observations provide an integrated flux limit from gb  1508 + 5714 of @xmath1100 mjy ( 1@xmath17 ) measured from the fits map obtained by the vlss survey ( cohen et al .",
    "the integrated low - frequency radio emission may well be dominated by the kpc - scale jet as radio core spectra are typically flat or inverted ( @xmath19  [ radiospec ] ) , and its emission is expected to be mostly self - absorbed in the lwa - bands . if there is `` contaminating '' emission from the radio core and/or sub - arcsecond scale jet , astrometric uncertainties of order 1  or less in the lwa observations are then necessary to distinguish emission from the different components .",
    "@xmath23 the break in the electron spectrum constrains the peak of the compton component to a narrow range ( formally between 5 and 160 kev ) .",
    "the steep cm - wave spectrum we have measured implies that ic / cmb emission from the highest - redshift jets may be minimal in the glast bands ( @xmath1010 mev ) .",
    "if these steep cm - wave spectra persist in other high - z jets , glast studies of ic / cmb x - ray jets may be restricted to lower - redshift targets with detected optical synchrotron jets ( e.g. sambruna et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the one - zone synchrotron+ic / cmb model invokes relativistic motion on the observed kpc - scales in order to preserve equipartition ( i.e. avoid very large total energies ) .",
    "this appears at odds with previous radio jet asymmetry studies which set upper limits on the jet speed of order @xmath293 ( bridle et al .",
    "1994 ; wardle & aaron 1997 ; hardcastle et al . 1999 ) .",
    "although the bulk beaming factor necessary to explain the level of x - ray emission in the gb  1508 + 5714 jet is not very large , other known examples show that @xmath0 s up to @xmath125 are necessary ( e.g. harris & krawcynski 2002 ; kataoka & stawarz 2005 ) .",
    "one way to relax the speeds invoked is to assume that kpc - scale quasar jets are not in equipartition as discussed recently in kataoka & stawarz ( 2005 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the jets are characterized by sub - equipartition field and are particle dominated .",
    "this leads to quite unfavorably larger total energy requirements and synchrotron models may provide a better solution ( e.g. atoyan & dermer 2004 ) .      to maintain both equipartition and to accommodate radio studies which inferred slower jet speeds than in the one - zone synchrotron+ic / cmb model",
    ", one can invoke additional structure in the jet .",
    "such `` two - fluid '' jet models have in fact been discussed for some time .",
    "early radio studies advocated `` transverse '' velocity structures with the observed radio emission originating from a slower moving outer sheath which hides emission from a faster moving spine ( see summary by bridle 1996 ) .",
    "in powerful radio - galaxies and lobe - dominated quasars , we are preferentially viewing the slower - moving outer radio - emitting jet layer whose beaming cone is wide . in this case , the ic / cmb x - rays viewed by us originate predominantly from the same observed radio emission and the one - zone synchrotron+ic / cmb model is a good approximation ",
    "chandra / radio observations of these jets may truly be telling us about their physical conditions .    in this picture , the x - rays `` reveal '' the faster jet spine in the core - dominated quasars which is responsible for most , if not all of the ic / cmb emission ( celotti et al .",
    "2001 ) . with additional transverse velocity structures come naturally other sources of high - energy emission such as turbulent interactions between the spine - sheath layers ( stawarz & ostrowski 2002 ) . in the ic / cmb scenario ,",
    "the outer portion of the jet producing most of the observed radio emission will certainly emit ic / cmb radiation also , especially at high - redshift .",
    "the key is not whether there are ic / cmb x - rays , it is to consider also how much is being produced by the hypothetical fast spine - layer ( jorstad & marscher 2004 ) , and if its radio luminosity is only a fraction of the observed , how do we use the x - rays observations to tell us something useful about its physical properties ?    in several kpc - scale jets in core - dominated quasars ,",
    "the x - ray emission terminates abruptly , while the radio emission continues on for 10 s kpc or more ( e.g. 0827 + 243 , jorstad & marscher 2004 ; pks  0605085 , pks  1510089 , and 1642 + 690 , sambruna et al .",
    "do these mark the decollimation points of the fast spines ?",
    "one can indeed find other core - dominated quasars where there is roughly 1 - 1 correspondence between the radio and x - ray emissions throughout the jets ( e.g. sambruna et al .",
    "2004 ; marshall et al .",
    "2005 ) , and lobe - dominated quasars whose x - ray jets do not persist to the terminal radio features ( e.g. pks  1136135 , sambruna et al .",
    "this may be a resolution dependent effect , as two of the largest angular - size jets ( @xmath130  ) show multi - wavelength offsets in the terminal features ( pks  1127145 , siemiginowska et al .",
    "2002 ; pks  1354 + 195 , sambruna et al .",
    "2004 ) with the x - rays leading the radio .",
    "how fast can the spine - beams be ?",
    "presumably from the observed x - ray emission , one can deduce physical properties of the spines with the usual machinery ( section 2.2 ) , as a function of fraction , @xmath30 , of the detected radio emission . as an analog to past studies of jet interaction with the accretion disk photon field ( e.g. phinney 1987 , melia & knigl 1989 )",
    ", the implied beaming factors should not be so high as to avoid compton drag by the cmb photons , although this may be a way to explain the widely observed declining x - ray to radio flux ratios observed in many jets , which can be interpreted as jet - deceleration on the observed kpc - scales ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2004 ) . if also the beaming cones are made too narrow ( @xmath11/@xmath0 )",
    ", one has to explain why we are finding x - ray emission from the majority of prominent radio jets in core - dominated quasars .",
    "most chandra studies of quasar jets have so far targeted _ known _ arcsecond - scale radio jets ( e.g. sambruna et al . 2004 , marshall et al .",
    "2005 ) , and most are found at z@xmath312 ( liu & zhang 2002 ) .",
    "in fact , not many z@xmath102 radio jets ( kpc - scale ) are known .",
    "the most extensive radio imaging studies of high - redshift quasars to date are vla snapshot observations ( few min .",
    "scans ) of quasars at redshifts of up to only @xmath13 ( taylor et al .",
    "1996 ; barthel et al .",
    "2000 , and refs . therein ) . from these studies ,",
    "only a handful of arcsecond - scale jets are extended enough to be imaged with chandra .    the majority of z@xmath103 flat - spectrum radio quasars have only been discovered over the last few years from large surveys ( e.g. hook et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) , and systematic radio imaging studies have yet been carried out  we are aiming to remedy this deficiency with a vla imaging survey .    .",
    "the beam is 2.41 @xmath26 1.03  at a pa of 0.2 deg .",
    ", width=226 ]      we used ned to help compile a sample to search for extended radio jets with the vla with the aim of followup chandra imaging . for an initial sample , we selected objects with redshifts of 3.4 and greater , and radio fluxes 100 mjy at 1.4 and/or 5 ghz .",
    "we excluded known radio galaxies and steep spectrum sources ( e.g. van breugel et al .",
    "1999 ; de breuck et al . 2001 ) and focused on the flat - spectrum ones ( a first order proxy for high beaming ) to facilitate a comparison with the known z@xmath62 x - ray jets in core - dominated quasars .",
    "our goal was to compile the best candidates to be imaged with the vla in order to determine how common large - scale jets are at high - redshift , rather than to create a complete sample .",
    "imaging the fainter objects and extending to lower redshifts ( z@xmath133.4 ) are obvious extensions to our work and this is planned .",
    "we then performed a literature and vla archive search of the 43 sources in our final sample ( z=3.44.8 ) : 9 have known radio structures ( jets , gravitational lenses ) , or have sufficient archival vla data ( table  1 ) .",
    "our final targets were drawn from the remaining 34 objects which did not have suitable vla data available .",
    "six objects are at declinations of @xmath32 , so may explain why so little archival vla data are available for them ( see below ) .",
    "over nine observing runs in 2004 oct and dec , we observed 26 targets with the vla - a configuration at 1.4 and 5 ghz ( resolution 1 and 0.4 arcsec ) .",
    "since the main goal of this survey was to find jets , we only obtained short snapshots at 5 ghz to estimate spectra relative to the deeper 1.4 ghz images .",
    "archival vla data exist for a handful of other sources satisfying our criteria and these have been analyzed also .",
    "this led to the discovery of a 3.6  long radio jet in one quasar , pks  2000330 ( figure  2 ) .",
    "archival chandra data were available for the z=3.9 quasar 1745 + 624 , which revealed an x - ray counterpart ( figure  3 ) to its known radio jet ( becker et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the details of this survey will be presented elsewhere . in summary ,",
    "extended radio features are detected in @xmath150@xmath13 of the sample , although only a handful are extended enough in the z 3.4 sample to be imaged with chandra s @xmath1arcsecond resolution .",
    "the most distant object we found with a jet is the z=4.72 quasar gb  1428 + 4217 ( fabian et al .",
    "proposed x - ray observations will allow us to determine the relative importance of ic / cmb versus synchrotron x - ray emissions at the highest - redshifts , leading to an important test of expectations between the x - ray emission models .",
    "jets are common features of radio - loud agn , at radio and x - ray wavelengths , at least locally ( z@xmath62 ) . our work suggests that this may be true also at high - redshift ( out to z=4.7 ) at radio wavelengths . proposed chandra observations will tell us if this is true also at x - rays . extending studies to these",
