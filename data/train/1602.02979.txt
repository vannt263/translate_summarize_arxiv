    "the large ground state degeneracy which is the hallmark of geometrically frustrated magnets @xcite can give rise to emergent phenomena governed by degrees of freedom that are quite distinct from those of the underlying spin system . an exotic phase that is particularly sought after in frustrated magnets is the famous spin liquid state which was first proposed as a possible ground state for the triangular lattice heisenberg model @xcite and has been found e.g. in a charge - transfer salt , adjacent to a superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "the study of frustrated magnetism is plagued in many cases by the sign problem which makes quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations infeasible , while an exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian for sufficiently large systems is impossible due to the exponential increase of the hilbert space with system size .",
    "therefore the idea of a quantum simulator has been put forward @xcite , i.e. using a well - controlled physical system to emulate another physical system , adding complexity step by step .    in reference",
    "@xcite a penning trap quantum simulator is described which is expected to simulate a transverse field ising model with hamiltonian @xmath3 with tunable long - range interactions .",
    "we summarize the setup in the following : when a collection of ions is laser - cooled in a penning trap , below a certain temperature the ions undergo a structural phase transition from a plasma to a wigner crystal that is stabilized by their mutual coulomb repulsion . for a strong trapping potential in z - direction",
    "the system becomes two - dimensional and the corresponding wigner crystal is a triangular lattice . the number of trapped ions in a penning trap ranges from a few to a few millions ; in @xcite the creation of a triangular wigner crystal with @xmath4 300 @xmath5 ions was reported .",
    "there , the valence electron of each ion serves as a qubit , which is represented by the spin-@xmath6 operators @xmath7 in eq . .",
    "it can be driven by applying microwave radiation , which corresponds to an effective magnetic field that can be tuned to have both transverse and longitudinal components .",
    "the use of a spin - dependent optical dipole force allows to engineer a long - range ising - type spin - spin interaction @xmath8 between the internal two - level systems of the ions @xcite , where the exponent @xmath0 can be continuously varied between 0 and 3 ( dipolar decay ) by adjusting a laser detuning parameter .",
    "the mechanism by which this interaction arises is naturally long - range and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) if the direction of the spin - dependent optical dipole - force is perpendicular to the @xmath9 coulomb crystal so that ions with opposite spin move away from each other in the @xmath10-direction thereby minimizing their coulomb repulsion .",
    "ferromagnetic ( fm ) interactions can be generated by additionally adjusting a detuning from the eigenfrequencies of normal modes of the coulomb crystal .",
    "the goal of this paper is to map out the ground state phase diagram of this effective spin model as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath11 for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions , which may help to benchmark such a potential quantum simulator .    _",
    "long - range interactions : _ long - range systems are interesting as they exhibit a number of thermodynamic and dynamical peculiarities @xcite . while all ground states of gapped short - range hamiltonians obey the `` area law '' for the entanglement entropy , a violation thereof was recently found in the long - range transverse - field ising chain @xcite along with algebraically decaying correlation functions in a gapped phase ( see also @xcite for this last point ) .",
    "furthermore , apart from ion traps , one of the best realizations of the transverse - field ising model , the ising ferromagnet lihof@xmath12 @xcite , is actually long - range with a dipolar decay of the interactions .",
    "few works have dealt with the competition of long - range and afm interactions in 2d quantum spin models @xcite . on a bipartite lattice ,",
    "long - range afm interactions induce only weak frustration .",
    "the triangular lattice , on the other hand , is already frustrated , giving rise , in the case of the short - range ising afm , to a disordered classical ground state manifold with the long - range interactions leading - in principle - to additional frustration .",
    "the minimum energy configurations of the classical model with @xmath13 on the triangular lattice may depend sensitively on @xmath0 and computing them may amount to a difficult optimization problem . to the best of our knowledge the classical phase diagram of as a function of decay exponent @xmath0 is not known .",
    "it will be shown in the following that including quantum fluctuations through a transverse field , however , stabilizes a phase that extends over a range of decay exponents @xmath0 , thus merging potentially different classical ground states .    _",
    "order by disorder : _ let us first summarize the known results for the short - range case , starting from the classical triangular ising antiferromagnet and moving on to ferromangetically stacked layers of antiferromagnets , which - by virtue of a quantum - to - classical mapping - corresponds to a transverse field quantum ising model , which is the main subject of our interest .",
    "the phase diagram of the classical triangular ising antiferromagnet , which is obtained by setting @xmath14 in equation , is well - known from the work of wannier @xcite and stephenson @xcite : it is disordered at all temperatures with a macroscopic ground state degeneracy @xcite and critical spin - spin correlations at @xmath15 where @xmath16 decreases asymtotically as @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the ground state degeneracy can be explained by looking at the fourier transformation , @xmath18 , of the ising interactions on the triangular lattice and taking into account the nature of the ising spins . while @xmath19\\ ] ] has minima of @xmath20 at the corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone , at @xmath21 and equivalent points , such ordering vectors are not compatible with the hard - spin constraint of classical ising spins @xcite .",
    "the lowest possible energy per frustrated triangle can be realized in a multitude of ways so that a macroscopic ground state degeneracy arises .",
    "the situation changes for stacked triangular antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "if several triangular layers are stacked ferromagnetically on top of each other , chains of spins in the stacking direction can be combined to form an averaged macrospin .",
    "then , for finite temperature , the spins , which are coupled ferromagnetically within a chain , fluctuate and the averaging removes the hard - spin constraint so that the 2d system of chains can settle into the minima at ordering vectors @xmath22 .",
    "this is the classical , i.e. finite - temperature induced version of the phenomenon `` order by disorder '' .",
    "the transverse field quantum ising model can be mapped by the trotter - suzuki formalism to a ferromagnetically stacked classical ising model so that the statements made above for stacked triangular magnets carry over to the @xmath9 transverse field ising model on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "the mechanism that is responsible for the appearance of clock order in a transverse field is the quantum version of `` order by disorder '' : quantum fluctuations induced by the transverse field stabilize those states from the classical ground state manifold which can lower their energy the most by resonance processes .",
    "thus , the exponential degeneracy of the ground state manifold is lifted and - since the favoured states tend to be regularly structured spin configurations - an ordered state emerges .",
    "which resonance processes are possible within the ground state manifold ( and to which order in @xmath11 ) is determined by the lattice structure and the interactions @xcite . for fully frustrated systems , the action of the transverse field to lowest order within the ground state manifold is equivalent to @xmath23 because one always needs to flip two spins in order to get back to the ground state manifold .",
    "_ xy order parameter : _ the ordering vectors @xmath24 of the critical modes correspond to inequivalent points in the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "this implies a two - component order parameter .",
    "a landau - ginzburg - wilson analysis @xcite found an xy action with an xy symmetry breaking clock anisotropy term @xmath25    which , depending on the sign of the coefficient @xmath26 , selects between two different three - sublattice ordered states according to @xcite , namely a ferrimagnetic state @xmath27 for @xmath28 and a partially disordered antiferromagnetic state @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "both states are six - fold degenerate , which can be seen by relabeling the sublattices and by making use of spin - inversion symmetry .",
    "monte carlo simulations @xcite showed that at intermediate temperatures the stacked triangular antiferromagnet orders according to @xmath29 and at low temperatures approximately according to @xmath27 with possibly unsaturated magnetization .",
    "however , the nature of the low - temperature phase has been the subject of controversy @xcite .",
    "the fact that the frustration on the triangular lattice generates an xy order parameter has several consequences : with the clock term in being dangerously irrelevant , the transition from the paramagnetic to the clock ordered phase is believed to be in the 3d xy universality class @xcite .",
    "the location of this quantum critical point was determined to be at @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless transition from a clock - ordered phase with sublattice magnetization @xmath29 to a paramagnetic phase via an extended critical phase , which occurs as a consequence of a finite - temperature induced dimensional crossover in the @xmath32-dimensional quantum system , was also investigated in ref .",
    "the possibility of a kosterlitz - thouless transition at finite temperature in the long - range system is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 gives a mean - field analysis of both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic problem in a transverse field . in section 3",
    "we briefly discuss the variant of the stochastic series expansion qmc method that we have used .",
    "section 4 contains results on the long - range ferromagnet and antiferromagnet , respectively .",
    "the main results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "it is well - known that for the infinitely coordinated ising model , that is with weak constant interactions @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of sites , the saddle point approximation , which maps the system to a mean - field problem , becomes exact .",
    "it is intuitively clear that for long - range systems mean - field theory provides a good description .",
    "however , this is only true for fm interactions since long - range afm interactions lead to additional frustration .",
    "we start from the hamiltonian    @xmath35    where for the sake of completeness we have added a longitudinal field @xmath36 . writing the spin operator in terms of small fluctuations around an average value , @xmath37 , and neglecting second - order fluctuations , a mean - field hamiltonian can be obtained @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fourier transform of the interactions .",
    "thus , dropping an overall constant , the thermodynamics reduces to that of paramagnetic spins in a longitudinal and transverse field . the single - spin hamiltonian can easily be diagonalized with eigenenergies @xmath40 and eigenvectors @xmath41 with @xmath42 so that the self - consistency condition for the thermal average ( with @xmath43 ) is given by @xmath44    in the limit @xmath45 this reduces to the well - known mean - field equation for an ising ferromagnet in a longitudinal field . in the following we consider @xmath46 so that the only contribution to the longitudinal field is the mean field coming from the interaction with other spins .",
    "taking the limit @xmath47 gives the phase boundary @xmath48 with a zero - temperature critical point at @xmath49 and a critical point a zero field at @xmath50 . at @xmath15 the order parameter increases as @xmath51 , as is typical of mean - field solutions .",
    "thus , in this admittedly very simple model the extent of the ordered phase scales with the interaction sum @xmath52 , which - as will be shown below - provides already qualitatively correct predictions of the phase boundary for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic long - range interactions . for a mean - field treatment of the antiferromagnet",
    "we assume that the magnetic unit cell consists of three sites .",
    "then , the self - consistency equation for each of the sublattices a , b and c reads @xmath53 with the longitudinal mean field @xmath54 acting at sites @xmath55 .",
    "the equations for @xmath56 and @xmath57 are obtained by cyclic permutation of the indices @xmath58 .",
    "the interaction sum @xmath59 gives the interaction of a spin in sublattice @xmath60 with all other spins in the same sublattice .",
    "@xmath61 is the interaction of a spin in sublattice @xmath60 with all spins in either of the other two sublattices @xmath62 or @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . with the reasonable assumption that the total magnetization has to be zero , @xmath65 , the mean field simplifies to @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the mean - field phase boundary of the antiferromagnet is the same as that of the ferromagnet , except that it is scaled by the interaction sum @xmath67 .",
