    "macroscopic quantum coherence has a long history that may date back to the famous schrdinger s cat paradox @xcite .",
    "although current research in quantum mechanics does not impose a strict boundary between quantum and classical realms , realising reliable microscopic - macroscopic entanglement is still a challenge due to the so - called decoherence processes which are especially severe for a macroscopic object .",
    "this explains that entanglement is most commonly observed in the microscopic world . in recent years , several attempts in establishing entanglement in the macroscopic or mesoscopic systems",
    "have been made @xcite . in the same spirit ,",
    "quantum entanglement between a microscopic object and a macroscopic object is expected to be a useful resource for the emerging quantum technology such as quantum information processing and quantum computing .",
    "in addition , a deeper understanding of the micro - macro entanglement and its decoherence process may be important for a better understanding of transition from classical to quantum realms @xcite .",
    "apart from the motivation from the theoretical research activities , the latest developments in experimental entanglement generation , control and manipulation have provided a direct impetus for further explorations of this important setting based on optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "the radiation pressure in an optical cavity is capable of producing entanglement between the quantized cavity modes ( microscopic system ) and a movable mirror @xcite .",
    "when the mass of the mirror is in the macroscopic scale , such an optomichanical system provides a natural testing bed for macroscopic quantum mechanical phenomena @xcite .",
    "theoretically , markov langevin equations or the corresponding master equations may be used to deal with an optomechanical system when the environmental noises can be treated as a weak perturbation and the noisy memory effect can be ignored @xcite .",
    "however , it becomes clear that , from both theoretical and experimental viewpoint , the memory effects plays a pivotal role in micro - macro entanglement dynamics in non - markovian regimes @xcite .",
    "notably , a recent experimental observation @xcite has explicitly shown that the heat bath coupled to the optomechanical system is in non - markovian regimes . moreover ,",
    "the non - markovian properties are shown to be useful in preserving optomechanical entanglement @xcite .",
    "in addition , an environmental engineering technique for a non - markovian bath demonstrated in an optical experiment @xcite has suggested a promising future in manipulating non - markovian environments to control quantum dynamics of the system of interest .",
    "hence , it is highly desirable to develop a systematic approach to investigate the dynamics of optomechanical system in non - markovian regime .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the entanglement between the light field in a fabry - prot cavity and one movable reflection mirror of the cavity ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the movable mirror is assumed to be embedded in a non - markovian environment modeled by a bosonic bath .",
    "we shall begin our discussion with an exact quantum description of the optomechanical system consisting of cavity modes and the movable mirror .",
    "the advantage of the exact treatment is that the memory effect in this model can be treated in a systematic way without introducing any d hoc parameters to represent the environmental noises .",
    "we shall use the non - markovian quantum state diffusion ( nmqsd ) equation to solve quantum open systems coupled to a non - markovian bosonic or fermionic environment @xcite .",
    "such a stochastic approach provides a very powerful tool in both analytical treatments and numerical simulations , especially in dealing with the non - markovian perturbation and solving the corresponding master equation for the open quantum systems . with our approach ,",
    "the model considered in this paper can be solved efficiently to exhibit the non - markovian properties that affect the dynamics of optomechanical entanglement .",
    "more specifically , our results show that the environmental memory can significantly alter the speed of the optomechanical entanglement generation between the cavity field and the movable mirror .",
    "our approach can also incorporate importantly the high frequency back reaction of the environment , which will be shown to significantly preserve the generated entanglement .",
    "furthermore , we show that a proper choice of effective detuning is also crucial for optimizing the optomechanical entanglement .",

    "[ sec : numerical - results - and ] analyzes in detail the environmental memory effects on the entanglement between the mechanical mode and the intracavity mode .",
    "in particular , we show how the effective environment central frequency can be used to modulate the optomechanical entanglement .",
    "in addition , we show that the maximum entanglement may be achieved by properly choosing the effective detuning which is significantly dependent on the strength of the memory effect of the environment .",
