    "plasmas , in their full generality , make up a highly complex class of physical systems , from classical tenuous plasmas , in e.g.  fluorescent lighting , to dense , strongly coupled systems , such as qcd plasmas .",
    "the large span of plasma systems implies that a wide variety of theoretical methods have been developed for their treatment .",
    "even so , there are general principles that remain as common features between the different plasma systems .",
    "therefore , methods used for one plasma system can in some cases be transferred to another plasma type , sometimes leading to new insights .",
    "one such example is the transferal of techniques for treating nonlinearities in classical plasmas to quantum mechanical plasmas .",
    "the latter , often termed quantum plasmas ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "pines , manfredi , melrose , shukla - eliasson ) , to lowest order contains corrections due to the classical regime in terms of nonlocal terms , related to the tunneling aspects of the electron ( in quantum plasmas , the ions are most often treated classically ) .",
    "such tunneling effects can be incorporated in both kinetic and fluid descriptions of the collective electron motion @xcite .",
    "such collective tunneling effects may , e.g. , lead to nanoscale limitations in plasmonic devices @xcite and bound states near moving test charges in plasmas @xcite .",
    "another mean - field effect that may be added to the dynamics of classical plasmas concerns the electron spin , i.e. the possibility of large - scale magnetization of plasmas @xcite .",
    "such magnetization switching is known to be able to give new non - trivial features , such as metamaterial properties , allowing for , e.g. , new soliton modes pendry , brodin - marklund . moreover , the inclusion of the electron spin into the collective dynamics can be done either through a fluid or a kinetic approach @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of spin into the dynamics of a quantum plasma points in the direction of relativistic effects in such plasma systems , e.g. collective spin - orbit coupling .",
    "it is the intention of the present work to extend previous work into the weakly relativistic regime .",
    "as indicated above , the dynamics of plasmas under extreme conditions is an important and integral part at many current and up - coming experimental facilities , and such investigations therefore constitutes a highly active research field . in particular ,",
    "laboratory plasmas , such as laser generated plasmas , are currently presenting the possibility of studying previously unattainable plasma density regimes .",
    "it is well - known that in the high - density regime @xcite quantum effects start to play a role for , e.g. , the dispersive properties of plasma waves neumayer , fustlin , glenzer . in nature",
    ", such dense relativistic plasmas can be found in planetary interiors and in stars @xcite .",
    "moreover , relativistic contributions to such plasma dynamics are under many circumstances very important @xcite .",
    "thus , when the parameters takes values characteristic for the quantum relativistic regime , one needs to consider more complex dynamical models in order to obtain accurate descriptions of a host of phenomena . a canonical starting point for dealing with high - density effects in a perturbative relativistic regime",
    "is offered by the quantum kinetic approach , here based on the dirac description .",
    "effects that can be included in such a perturbative model includes , e.g. , spin dynamics , spin - orbit coupling , and zitterbewegung .",
    "these examples have close connections to the nonperturbative relativistic quantum regime , in which e.g. pair production nerush - etal , hebenstreit - etal1,hebenstreit - etal2,elkina - etal and other nonlinear quantum vacuum effects @xcite become pronounced    dense plasmas , and in particular short - time scale phenomena therein , have been successfully studied using green s functions techniques , such as the kadanoff - baym kinetic equations @xcite ( see also refs .  zwanzig , prigogine , barwinkel , klimontovich for similar approaches , and ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview and examples from femtosecond laser physics ) .",
    "although the kadanoff - baym equations and similar indeed gives ample opportunity to treat a wide variety of systems , their generality also makes simplifying assumptions necessary , and under certain circumstances a mean - field model , that still retains memory effects and non - local structures , can be an adequate approximation @xcite .",
    "in particular the mean - field approach is well suited outside the regime of strong coupling effects . here , we will be interested in phenomena in plasmas that are not strongly coupled , but still in regimes where a classical plasma descriptions is not fully adequate .",
    "here we stress that a large number of different dimensionless parameters ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for more complete discussions ) is needed to give a thorough description of  various plasma regimes .",
    "however , much insight can be gained by considering a simple density - temperature plot . in figure",
    "[ fig : regimes ] a schematic view of the parameter regime of interest for our study is presented , adopted from ref .",
    "@xcite    in section [ 1 ] we recall the foldy - wouthuysen transformation for particles in external fields and as a result we obtain a semi - relativistic hamiltonian .",
    "we then go on to define the scalar quasi - distribution function for spin-1/2 particles in section [ 2 ] .",
    "in section iv we then derive the corresponding evolution equation for the distribution function .",
    "the evolution equation clearly depicts the importance of the different terms of the relativistic expansion .",
    "a comparison of our results to previous studies is made , and we discuss the applicability of our equation as well as the interpretation of the variables involved . in section v our theory is illustrated by means of two examples from linearized theory , and finally , in section vi , our main conclusions are summarized .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath1 where we have the _ even _ ( @xmath2 ) operator @xmath3 and the _ odd _ ( @xmath4 ) operator @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the @xmath8 dirac matrices , @xmath9 is the electron mass , @xmath10 is the charge ( @xmath11 for an electron ) , @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath13 is the momentum operator and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the scalar and vector potential , respectively .",
    "the odd operators in the dirac hamiltonian couples the positive and negative energy states of the dirac bi - spinor . for the purpose of obtaining a perturbative expansion in the parameter @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the typical energy associated with the second and third term in ( [ eq : form ] ) , we assume that the first term in ( [ eq : form ] ) is large compared to these terms . the consecutive application of the unitary foldy  wouthuysen ( fw ) @xcite transformation @xmath18 yields a new hamiltonian of the form ( [ eq : form ] ) in which the new odd operators are of the order @xmath19 . performing this transformation",
    "@xmath20 times yields terms up to order @xmath21 .",
    "this gives a separation of the positive and negative energy states up to an arbitrary order @xmath20 in @xmath19 .",
    "applying this transformation four times gives the following hamiltonian for positive energy states with only even operators @xcite @xmath22 -\\frac{i\\hbar ^{2}q}{8m^{2}c^{2}}\\bm{\\sigma}\\cdot \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{e }   \\notag \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{8m^{3}c^{2}}\\left ( \\hat{\\mathbf{p}}-\\frac{q}{c}\\mathbf{a}\\right ) ^{4 }   \\label{eq : pos}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath23 here denotes a vector containing the @xmath24 pauli matrices , @xmath25 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath10 is the charge , @xmath9 is the mass , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the magnetic and electric field and @xmath28 and @xmath15 are the corresponding potentials in the coulomb gauge .",
    "we see that the first four terms constitute the pauli hamiltonian , while the remaining terms are higher order corrections .",
    "in particular , the sixth and seventh terms together gives thomas precession and spin - orbit coupling , while the fifth and eight terms are the darwin term and the so called mass - velocity correction term , respectively .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pos ] ) as well as in the dirac theory we started from , the value of the spin @xmath29-factor is exactly 2 . when applying the resulting theory , in section v , we will use the qed corrected value of @xmath30 , however . in spite of the smallness of the modification it turns out that this correction is important , as the applications of our theory are very sensitive to the exact value of the @xmath29-factor",
    "in fact , the sensitivity of the kinetic theory to the value of @xmath29 was seen already in ref .",
    "this may suggest that for consistency , the hamiltonian for qed - corrections should be added to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pos ] ) .",
    "such an approach would indeed modify the @xmath29-value to the desired one in the theory presented below , but the augmented hamiltonian would also add several new terms in the evolution equation for the electrons .",
    "those extra terms are at least smaller than those kept by a factor of the order @xmath31 , however .",
    "thus the main effect from qed in the regime of study is the modification of the value of the @xmath29-factor as compared to the dirac theory . as a consequence , the contributions from qed ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for qed - corrections to the dirac hamiltonian ) besides modifying the @xmath29-value will not be included here .",

    "the wigner - stratonovich transform has the property that it must to be taken separately for each component of the 2-by-2 density matrix .",
    "different approaches to construct a kinetic theory from the wigner - stratonovich transformation are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . following this reference",
    "we here define a scalar distribution function @xmath44 in the extended phase - space phase - space - note where @xmath45 is a vector of unit length .",
    "this distribution function satisfies that @xmath46gives the probability to find the particle at position @xmath47 with spin - up in the direction of @xmath45 , and @xmath48gives the probability to find the particle with momentum @xmath49 with spin - up in the direction of @xmath45 . using the wigner - stratonovich transformation ,",
    "the scalar distribution function will be defined as zamanian @xmath50where @xmath51 denotes the trace over the spin indices .",
    "we recall that the expectation value polarization density is now given by @xmath52=3\\int d^{3}pd^{2}sf(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{p},% \\mathbf{s},t)\\mathbf{s } ,   \\label{spint - calc}\\]]where we stress the need for the factor 3 .",
    "this follows from the form of the transformation and is needed to compensate for the quantum mechanical smearing of the distribution function in spin space .",
    "furthermore , it should be stressed that the independent spin variable @xmath45 constructed in ( [ spintrans ] ) generates the rest frame expression for the spin . in our theory , which is only weakly relativistic , this has limited consequences .",
    "the relation between the rest frame spin @xmath45 , and the spatial part of a the spin four - vector @xmath53 is given by @xmath54(\\mathbf{v\\cdot s)v/}c^{2}$ ] @xcite , where the kinematic quantities ( i.e. the gamma factor @xmath55 and the velocity @xmath56 ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath45 ( see below ) . since",
    "our weakly relativistic theory presented here is only concerned with spin - dependent terms up to order @xmath57 , the difference between @xmath53 and @xmath45 may be overlooked for the most part , e.g. when computing the magnetization current density .",
    "using the above formalism we obtain a fully gauge invariant vlasov - like evolution equation for charged particles .",
    "one of the most basic quantum effects is the tendency for the wave function to spread out . in the non - relativistic version of the theory",
    "@xcite this effect end up in operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 acting on the fields and the distribution function , where the operators can be defined through the trigonometric taylor - expansions @xcite . in our present theory we will view the spatial gradient operator @xmath60 as a small parameter , and drop terms of order @xmath61 or smaller , which means dropping particle dispersive effects , that are smaller by a factor of the order @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the characteristic de broglie wavelength over the macroscopic scale length .",
    "the other approximation made is to only account for weakly relativistic effects , as described above .",
    "this implies that only terms up to first order in the velocity is kept , and that the gamma factor is put to unity .",
    "the evolution equation is found using the transformations and on the evolution equation , which together with the above given approximations results in @xmath64where @xmath49 is the momentum ( which is related to the velocity through the spin ; see below ) and @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) .",
    "the evolution equation has three new effects compared to the equation in ref .",
    "@xcite for spin-@xmath0 particles .",
    "the first one is the thomas precession effect where the previous theory @xcite is extended by the substitution @xmath67 in the fourth and fifth terms of eq . .",
    "this effect comes from the spin - orbit coupling contribution in hamiltonian and , therefore , it is directly coupled with the evolution of the spin .",
    "the second new effect is the last term which is associated to the darwin term .",
    "this term introduces the zitterbewegung effect of the electron , and is the only contribution proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "the third effect is seen in the velocity - momentum relation , which is highlighted in the second and third terms . in eq .",
    "the term in @xmath69 brackets resembles a velocity which has been modified by the spin , which will be discussed in some detail below .",
    "finally , we point out that the factor in front of @xmath70 in the third term is indeed given by @xmath71 @xcite , i.e. the _ laboratory rate of change _ of the _ rest frame value _ of the spin .",
    "thus we note that eq .",
    "( [ vlasovc ] ) is consistent with the interpretation of @xmath45 as the rest frame variable for the spin .",
    "next we consider the relation between the velocity and momentum . in order to relate this variables we use the heisenberg equation of motion for the velocity operator@xmath72.\\]]for the hamiltonian we then get @xmath73where we have neglected the last term in the hamiltonian to simplify the equation slightly ,",
    "( see the discussion about the mass correction below ) .",
    "we now recall that the wigner transformation for an operator is multiplied by a factor @xmath74 , as compared to the the wigner transformation for the density matrix .",
    "similarly , for the spin transformation , the transformation for operators comes with a factor 3 .",
    "taking this into account and calculating the wigner and q transformation of the operator above gives the final relation @xmath75this is the function in extended phase space , which can be used to calculate the average velocity and the current density of the plasma .",
    "an important question that arises is whether the current density based on the velocity ( [ velocity ] ) will give the _ free current density _ or if correspond to some other physical quantity , e.g. the total current density .",
    "this question is addressed below , where we calculate the energy conservation law of our system , which confirms that the velocity in eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) is indeed the variable corresponding to the free current density .    in a more general context",
    ", the relationship between the momentum and the velocity is nontrivial .",
    "e.g. the spin orbit coupling has been shown to arise as a berry phase term @xcite .",
    "for further discussion of this interesting topic see e.g. @xcite .    when obtaining the evolution equation , we have not considered the effect of the mass - velocity correction term in order to get a more transparent formalism .",
    "this term will only produce a correction of the form @xmath76 in the second term .",
    "although this term is of the same order in an expansion in @xmath77 , as compared to other terms that have been kept , we will not consider it as the classical relativistic terms are already well - known .",
    "instead we focus on the new effects introduced by the spin and the zitterbewegung .",
    "the dynamics of the distribution function given by the vlasov equation is in the mean field approximation coupled to the maxwell equations in the form @xmath78where the total charge density and total current density are given by @xmath79 in the above expressions , the free charge density is @xmath80where @xmath81 is the integration measure performed over the three velocity variables and the two spin degrees of freedom . the spin vector has a fixed unity length and it is thus convenient to use spherical coordinates @xmath82 do describe it .",
    "the free current density is given by @xmath83with these charge and current densities , the conservation of charge is obtained as from to be @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore the magnetization @xmath85 and the polarization @xmath86 are both due to the spin and they are calculated respectively as @xmath87and @xmath88    the system of maxwell s equations with the magnetization ( [ magnetization ] ) and polarization ( [ polarization ] ) and free current density ( free - current ) , together with our main equation ( [ vlasovc ] ) , satisfies an energy conservation law of the form @xmath89here the total energy density @xmath90 is given by @xmath91and the energy flux vector @xmath92 is given by @xmath93apparently the first terms in ( [ energy - density ] ) constitute the electromagnetic field energy density , and the integral term is the combined kinetic and magnetic dipole energy density .",
    "the first term of ( energy - flux ) is the poynting vector , whereas the latter represents the combined flux of kinetic energy density and magnetic dipole energy .",
    "this energy conservation equation is a generalization of previous results for semi - classical theories for spin-1/2 plasmas @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that although the theory presented here contains approximation , e.g. due to the weakly relativistic assumptions , the conservation law ( energy - conservation ) is an exact property of the presented model .",
    "in the present section , we are going to study the influence of the spin - orbit coupling and of the darwin term on linear wave propagation . for this purpose",
    "we linearize the evolution equation , where the variables are separated into equilibrium and perturbed quantities ( using the subindices @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , to denote them ) .",
    "thus , the distribution function will be @xmath96 , and the electric and magnetic field could be written as @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively .",

    "firstly we want to focus on the effect associated with zitterbewegung .",
    "the zitterbewegung is a rapid oscillatory motion of the electron which implies that if an instantaneous measurement of its velocity is performed , the result is the speed of light .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillatory motion is @xmath102 @xcite , which means that the electron can not be localized , but is rapidly oscillating in a volume of the order of the cube of the compton wavelength .",
    "the zitterbewegung is a quantum relativistic effect and it is related to particle - antiparticle nature of the dirac theory and to the nature of the spin . at the present ,",
    "there is a growing interest in the detection of effects as the zitterbewegung @xcite .",
    "the effect of the zitterbewegung of the electron is introduced in the last term of eq . , the darwin contribution , which represents the smeared out electrostatic potential field that the electron sees when it fluctuates over a distance @xmath103 .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we examine the dispersion relation of langmuir waves in an unmagnetized plasma . in order to focus on the effects of the darwin contribution",
    ", we consider a one - dimensional unperturbed momentum distribution and let @xmath104 @xmath105 ( for a more realistic 3d - momentum distribution , even the electrostatic unmagnetized case couple to the spin terms , as we will see in the next section ) .",
    "the total distribution function will then have the form of @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the equilibrium and the perturbed distribution functions respectively .",
    "furthermore , we consider a homogeneous plasma an neglect the motion of the heavy ions .",

    "the landau damping term has been dropped , since the resonance is assumed to lie in the tail of the distribution .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath119 is the zitterbewegung contribution to electrostatic modes . for not too large wave - numbers it is more significant than quantum contributions from the bohm potential manfredi that scales as @xmath120",
    ". provided the wave - numbers are small , @xmath121 , and the dispersion relation can be further approximated as @xmath122where @xmath123 can be understood as a velocity response of the plasma @xmath124 to the rapid oscillations of the zitterbewegung motion .",
    "the term @xmath125 comes from the fact that the electron sees a smeared out electrostatic potential , and therefore , a gradient of the electric field and a force of the order @xmath126 .",
    "similar to the effects of the fermi pressure ( which gives a non - zero @xmath127 even when the temperature goes to zero ) this implies a non - zero group velocity of the electron plasma waves even in the cold case ( see also fig . 2 for a comparison between the fermi statistics and the zitterbewegung , relevant for eq . ( [ 31 ] ) when @xmath128 ) .",
    "we note that the effect of the darwin term related to zitterbewegung becomes important for high - density plasmas when @xmath129 is not too much smaller than unity .",
    "the spin - orbit effect of hamiltonian appears as the thomas precession correction ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) of the magnetic field in the fourth and fifth terms of eq . .",

    "we consider again longitudinal electrostatic modes @xmath130 , but now propagating along an external magnetic field @xmath131 .",
    "as will be seen below , this will give an illustrative example of how the spin - orbit coupling modifies the usual dispersion relation .",

    "however , it should be noted that the present wave mode is quite different from that previously found . in particular , the field is now completely electrostatic ( whereas it was found to be completely electromagnetic in the previous case ) , and the present wave mode exists in the long wavelength regime , whereas the former wave mode brodin was dependent on a short wavelength , i.e. of the order of the electron gyroradius or shorter .",
    "finally we note that even in the absence of an external magnetic field , a finite contribution from the electron spin remains , together with the darwin contribution . in the absence of resonances",
    "we note that both these quantum contributions require a very high plasma density to be significant .",
    "the starting point for our theory is the fw - transformation , applied on the dirac equation , which is used to pick out the positive energy states . using the wigner - stratonovich transformation ( [ wstrans ] ) on the density matrix , together with a q - transformation @xcite",
    "a scalar distribution function ( [ spintrans ] ) can be defined . in the weakly relativistic limit",
    ", the evolution equation is given by ( [ vlasovc ] ) to leading order in the expansion parameters @xmath172 and @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is a characteristic macroscopic scale length , @xmath175 a characteristic momentum of particles , and @xmath176 a characteristic magnitude of the magnetic field .",
    "in addition to the magnetic dipole force and spin precession @xcite , which is included already in the pauli hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ vlasovc ] ) ) also contains spin - orbit interaction , including the thomas factor , and also the contribution from the darwin term .",
    "a complication in the ( weakly ) relativistic theory that should be noted is the relation between momentum and velocity ( [ velocity ] ) , which now is dependent on the spin variable .",
    "moreover , when closing the system , the polarization ( [ polarization ] ) associated with the spin must be included in the current and charge density ( [ tcurrent ] ) , and the expression for the free current density ( [ free - current ] ) is affected due to the aforementioned relation ( [ velocity ] ) .",
    "it should also be stressed that the spin variable used to define @xmath177 refers to the rest - frame spin , which is convenient , as two spherical angles for the spin variables is sufficient .    in order to illustrate the theory ,",
    "we have presented examples of electrostatic interaction in magnetized and non - magnetized plasmas . by picking a 1-d unperturbed distribution function ,",
    "the influence of the darwin term , which is associated with zitterbewegung , is highlighted in the case of a non - magnetized plasma .",
    "for a magnetized plasma , the spin - orbit terms leads to new types of resonances for electrostatic waves , which involve the combined effect of orbital and spin - precession motion .",
    "the theory presented here is of most interest for systems where at least one of the parameters @xmath178 or @xmath173 are not too small .",
    "examples include e.g. laser - plasma interactions , astrophysical objects ( e.g. white dwarf stars ) , solid state plasmas and strongly magnetized systems .",
    "the present paper is a first step to reach a fully relativistic quantum theory of plasmas .",
