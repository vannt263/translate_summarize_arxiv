    "we suggest estimating wncr as a linear function of target colour , rather than as a constant value .",
    "this will reduce errors , and will make the measurement procedure more objective .",
    "the errors described above can bias the results of a study of a class of galaxies by systematically underestimating or overestimating the emission - line flux .",
    "cosmic sf rate measurements at low redshifts may also be biased by this effect .",
