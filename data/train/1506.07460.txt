    "the accurate computation of thermal quantum rates is a major challenge in theoretical chemistry , as a purely classical description of the kinetics fails to capture zero - point energy , tunnelling , and phase effects@xcite .",
    "exact solutions using correlation functions , developed by yamamoto , miller , and others@xcite are only tractable for small or model systems , as the difficulty of computation scales exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "consequently , numerous approximate treatments have been developed , which can be broadly classed as those seeking an accurate description of the quantum statistics without direct calculation of the dynamics , and those which also seek to use an approximate quantum dynamics .",
    "methods in the first category include instanton theory@xcite , `` quantum instanton''@xcite , and various transition - state theory ( tst ) approaches@xcite .",
    "of many approximate quantum dynamics methods , particularly successful ones include the linearized semiclassical initial - value representation ( lsc - ivr ) @xcite , centroid molecular dynamics ( cmd)@xcite , and ring polymer molecular dynamics ( rpmd)@xcite .",
    "rpmd has been very successful for the computation of thermal quantum rates in condensed - phase processes , due to the possibility of implementation in complex systems such as ( proton - coupled ) electron transfer reaction dynamics or enzyme catalysis,@xcite and especially in small gas - phase systems@xcite where comparison with exact quantum rates and experimental data has demonstrated that rpmd rate theory is a consistent and reliable approach with a high level of accuracy .",
    "these numerical results have shown that rpmd rate theory is exact in the high - temperature limit ( which can also be shown algebraically@xcite ) , reliable at intermediate temperatures , and more accurate than other approximate methods in the deep tunnelling regime ( see eq .",
    "below ) , where it is within a factor of 23 of the exact quantum result .",
    "rpmd also captures zero - point energy effects,@xcite and provides very accurate estimates for barrierless reactions@xcite .",
    "it has been found to systematically overestimate thermal rates for asymmetric reactions and underestimate them for symmetric ( and quasisymmetric ) reactions in the deep tunnelling regime ( note that zero - point energy effects along the reaction coordinate must be taken into account when assigning the reaction symmetry.)@xcite recently a general code for rpmd calculations ( rpmdrate ) has been developed.@xcite    another appealing feature of rpmd rate theory is its rigorous independence to the location of the dividing surface between products and reactants@xcite , a property shared by classical rate theory and the exact quantum rate@xcite , but not by many transition - state theory approaches .",
    "the @xmath2 , tst limit of rpmd ( rpmd - tst ) is identical to true qtst : the instantaneous thermal quantum flux through a position - space dividing surface which is equal to the exact quantum rate in the absence of recrossing@xcite .",
    "a corollary of this is that rpmd will be exact for a parabolic barrier ( where there is no recrossing of the optimal dividing surface by rpmd dynamics or quantum dynamics , and qtst is therefore also exact)@xcite .    when the centroid is used as the dividing surface ( see eq .",
    "below ) , rpmd - tst reduces to the earlier theory of centroid - tst@xcite , which is a good approximation for symmetric barriers but significantly overestimates the rate for asymmetric barriers at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "this effect is attributable to the centroid being a poor dividing surface beneath the ` crossover ' temperature into deep tunnelling@xcite . in this ` deep tunnelling ' regime , rpmd - tst has a close relationship to semiclassical `` i m f '' instanton theory@xcite , which has been very successful for calculating rates beneath the crossover temperature , though has no first - principles derivation@xcite and was recently shown to be less accurate than qtst when applied to realistic multidimensional reactions@xcite .    very recently , both cmd and rpmd have been obtained from the exact quantum kubo - transformed@xcite time - correlation function ( with explicit error terms ) via a boltzmann - conserving `` matsubara dynamics''@xcite which considers evolution of the low - frequency , smooth `` matsubara '' modes of the path integral@xcite .",
    "matsubara dynamics suffers from the sign problem and is not presently amenable to computation on large systems .",
    "however , by taking a mean - field approximation to the centroid dynamics , such that fluctuations around the centroid are discarded , one obtains cmd.@xcite alternatively , if the momentum contour is moved into the complex plane in order to make the quantum boltzmann distribution real , a complex liouvillian arises , the imaginary part of which only affects the higher , non - centroid , normal modes . discarding the imaginary liouvillian leads to spurious springs in the dynamics and gives rpmd.@xcite consequently",
    ", rpmd will be a reasonable approximation to matsubara dynamics , provided that the timescale over which the resultant dynamics is required ( the timescale of ` falling off ' the barrier in rate theory ) is shorter than the timescale over which the springs ` contaminate ' the dynamics of interest ( in rate theory , this is usually coupling of the springs in the higher normal modes to the motion of the centroid dividing surface via anharmonicity in the potential ) .",
    "both rpmd and cmd are inaccurate for the computation of multidimensional spectra : the neglect of fluctuations in cmd leads to the `` curvature problem '' where the spectrum is red - shifted and broadened , whereas in rpmd the springs couple to the external potential leading to `` spurious resonances''@xcite . recently",
    ", this problem has been solved by attaching a langevin thermostat@xcite to the internal modes of the ring polymer@xcite ( which had previously been used for the computation of statistical properties@xcite ) , and the resulting thermostatted rpmd ( trpmd ) had neither the curvature nor resonance problem .",
    "the success of rpmd for rate calculation , and the attachment of a thermostat for improving its computation of spectra , naturally motivates studying whether trpmd will be superior for the computation of thermal quantum rates to rpmd ( and other approximate theories)@xcite , which this article investigates . given that rpmd is one of the most accurate approximate methods for systems where the quantum rates are available for comparison , further improvements would be of considerable benefit to the field .",
    "we firstly review trpmd dynamics in section [ ssec : trpmd ] , followed by developing trpmd rate theory in section  [ ssec : rate ] .",
    "to predict the behaviour of the rpmd rate compared to the trpmd rate , we apply one - dimensional kramers theory@xcite to the ring - polymer potential energy surface in section  [ ssec : kram ] . numerical results in section  [ sec : num ]",

    ".   holds regardless of the value of the friction matrix @xmath17 and that recrossing of individual ( stochastic ) trajectories can only reduce the trpmd rate from the qtst value , and hence qtst is an upper bound to the long - time trpmd rate .    in the following calculations we use a friction matrix which corresponds to damping of the free ring polymer vibrational frequencies , and which has been used in previous studies of trpmd for spectra.@xcite for an orthogonal transformation matrix @xmath52 such that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the spring matrix in eq",
    "@xmath55 , the friction matrix is given by @xmath56 here @xmath57 is an adjustable parameter , with @xmath58 giving critical damping of the free ring polymer vibrations , @xmath59 corresponding to optimal sampling of the free ring polymer potential energy , and @xmath60 corresponding to zero friction ( i.e.  rpmd).@xcite a crucial consequence of this choice of friction matrix is that the centroid of the ring polymer is unthermostatted , and the short - time error of trpmd from exact quantum dynamics is therefore @xmath61 , the same as rpmd.@xcite      to provide a qualitative description of the effect of friction on the trpmd transmission coefficient , we apply classical kramers theory@xcite in the extended @xmath62-dimensional ring polymer space , governed by dynamics on the ( temperature - dependent ) ring - polymer potential energy surface in eq .  .",
    "since the short - time limit of trpmd rate theory is equal to qtst , and its long - time limit invariant to the location of the dividing surface , trpmd will give the qtst rate through the optimal dividing surface ( defined as the surface which minimises @xmath63)@xcite , weighted by any recrossings of that dividing surface by the respective dynamics .",

    "rpmd is well - known to overestimate the quantum rate for this system at low temperatures.@xcite fig .",
    "[ fig : hch4 ] shows that above the crossover temperature ( 500k ) the friction parameter has a negligible effect on the rate .",
    "as the temperature is decreased below the crossover temperature ( 300k and 250k ) , the friction induces more recrossings of the dividing surface and , as a result , the trpmd rate approaches the exact quantum rate with increasing the friction parameter .",
    "reaction with a crossover temperature of 264k.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ fig : fhh ]    thus far , kramers theory has been surprisingly successful at qualitatively explaining the behaviour of the trpmd rate with increasing friction .",
    "present results would suggest that trpmd would therefore improve upon rpmd for all asymmetric reactions , where rpmd generally overestimates the rate beneath crossover@xcite .",
    "we then examine another prototypical asymmetric reaction , f+h@xmath0 , with a low crossover temperature of 264k .",
    "[ fig : fhh ] shows that at 500k and 300k , the trpmd rate is in good agreement with the quantum result , but increases very slightly with @xmath57 causing a spurious small negative value of @xmath96 in table  [ tab : tar ] . beneath crossover , at 200k the rate is virtually independent of lambda , apart from a very slight increase around @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , trpmd fares no better than rpmd for this system , contrary to the h+ch@xmath1 results and the predictions of kramers theory .",
    "this is likely attributable to a highly anharmonic and exothermic energy profile , and a very flat saddle point in ring - polymer space@xcite .    as can be seen from the graphs ,",
    "the simple kramers prediction is in surprisingly good qualitative agreement with the numerical results ( apart from f+h@xmath0 beneath crossover ) , even for the multidimensional cases , which is probably attributable to those reactions being dominated by a significant thermal barrier which appears parabolic on the ring - polymer potential energy surface , meaning that the one - dimensional kramers model is adequate for capturing the friction - induced recrossing . in table  [",
    "tab : tar ] the @xmath96 values , fitted to the numerical data , show that for a given reaction @xmath146 above the crossover temperature , and beneath the crossover temperature @xmath96 increases as the temperature is decreased .",
    "this can be qualitatively explained as the optimal dividing surface becoming more dependent on the thermostatted higher normal modes as the temperature is lowered@xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the highest value of @xmath96 is observed for the highly quantum mechanical d+muh reaction at 200k with @xmath147 .",
    "this is beneath one quarter of the crossover temperature , and one would therefore expect that friction would have a very significant effect on the rate .",
    "in this paper we have , for the first time , applied thermostatted ring polymer molecular dynamics ( trpmd ) to reaction rate theory .",
    "regardless of the applied friction , the long - time limit of the trpmd flux - side time - correlation function ( and therefore the trpmd rate ) is independent of the location of the dividing surface , and its short - time limit is equal to rigorous qtst@xcite . in section  [ ssec : kram ]",
    "we use kramers theory @xcite to predict that , above the crossover temperature , the rpmd and trpmd rates will be similar , and beneath crossover the trpmd rate for asymmetric systems will decrease with @xmath57 , and the same effect should be observed for symmetric systems beneath half the crossover temperature .",
    "trpmd rate theory has then been applied to the standard one - dimensional model systems of the symmetric and asymmetric eckart barriers , followed by the bimolecular reactions h+h@xmath0 , d+muh , h+ch@xmath1 and f+h@xmath0 . for all reactions considered , above the crossover temperature",
    "the trpmd rate is virtually invariant to the value of @xmath57 and therefore almost equal to rpmd , as predicted by kramers theory . beneath the crossover temperature ,",
    "most asymmetric reactions show a decrease in the trpmd rate as @xmath57 is increased , and in qualitative agreement with the kramers prediction in eq .  .",
    "a similar trend is observed for symmetric reactions , which also show some diminution in the rate with increasing friction above half the crossover temperature ( @xmath148 ) , probably due to the skewed ring - polymer pes causing a breakdown in the one - dimensional assumption of kramers theory . for the asymmetric and anharmonic case of f+h@xmath0 , beneath the crossover temperature",
    "there is no significant decrease in the rate with increased friction , illustrating the limitations of kramers theory .",
    "these results mean that beneath the crossover temperature trpmd will be a worse approximation to the quantum result than rpmd for symmetric and quasisymmetrical systems ( where rpmd underestimates the rate@xcite ) , and trpmd will be closer to the quantum rate for asymmetric potentials ( where rpmd overestimates the rate ) .",
    "however , the apparent increase in accuracy for asymmetric systems appears to be a cancellation of errors from the overestimation of the quantum rate by rpmd which is then decreased by the friction in the non - centroid normal modes of trpmd , and there is no a priori reason to suppose that one effect should equal the other for any given value of @xmath57 .",
    "although the above results do not advocate the use of trpmd rate theory as generally being more accurate than rpmd , trpmd rate calculation above the crossover temperature may be computationally advantageous in complex systems due to more efficient sampling of the ring - polymer phase space by trpmd trajectories than rpmd trajectories .",
    "trpmd may therefore provide the same accuracy as rpmd rate calculation at a lower computational cost , and testing this in high - dimensional systems where rpmd has been successful , such as complex - forming reactions@xcite , surface dynamics@xcite , and enzyme catalysis@xcite would be a useful avenue of future research .    future work could also include non - adiabatic systems@xcite , applying a thermostat to the centroid to model a bath system@xcite , and generalizations to non - markovian friction using grote - hynes theory@xcite .    in closing , present results suggest that trpmd can be used above the crossover temperature for thermally activated reactions , and beneath crossover further testing is required to assess its utility for asymmetric systems .",
