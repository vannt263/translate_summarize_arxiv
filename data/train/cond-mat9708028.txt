    "an existence of local excitations caused by crystal defects is a well - known phenomenon in solid state physics @xcite",
    ". a single point - like defect can give rise to new states localized in the vicinity of a defect with frequencies outside the bands of extended states of a host crystal .",
    "these states and their interaction with electromagnetic waves ( ir absorption , raman scattering ) were extensively studied since the early forties following pioneering works by lifshitz @xcite . in all these studies electromagnetic field was considered as an external field , which excites vibrational states .",
    "the feedback effect of the vibrations upon electromagnetic field was neglected . however , in ionic crystals in the region of frequencies closed to the crossing point of phonon and photon dispersion curves one has to take this effect into account because the coupling between electromagnetic waves and vibrations becomes so strong that the new kind of excitations  polaritons  emerges . in this situation the analyses of local vibrations and their interaction with electromagnetic field has to be done more carefully with taking the polariton effects into account . for the first time",
    "such a consideration was carried out in ref.@xcite where a novel kind of local excitations was discovered .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that if the polariton spectrum of a crystal exhibits a gap between polariton branches , where the density of states of a host material is equal to zero , a defect embedded in the crystal gives rise to local states with frequencies within the gap .",
    "these states are a mix of electromagnetic field and excitations of a host material .",
    "their properties appeared to be quite different from those of known local phonon states .",
    "unlike pure phonon systems , in the case of isotropic materials there is no minimum critical value of the `` strength '' of the impurity for local polariton states to appear .",
    "this feature was shown to be caused by a negative dispersion of optical phonons resulting in a non - monotonic dispersion of polaritons .",
    "a general analysis made in ref.@xcite refers to arbitrary `` polarization waves . ''",
    "it is applicable to a variety of excitations , such as phonon - polaritons , exciton - polaritons , etc .",
    "concerning a particular case of phonon - polaritons the model of a dipole interaction between scalar electromagnetic and polarization waves , used in ref.@xcite , needs to be extended to account for a vector nature of the excitations .",
    "moreover , the analysis of non - isotope impurities , affecting the elastic bonds around a defect , is not consistent within the scalar model .    in the present paper we take into account the vector nature of electromagnetic waves interacting with vibrations in crystals with cubic symmetry .",
    "we assumed that an impurity atom in addition to having a different mass can locally change elastic constants .",
    "the anisotropy of the crystal is assumed to be weak and is neglected in the long wavelength limit .",
    "we obtained two series of local states which differ in parity .",
    "in agreement with results of ref.@xcite , all these states appear first at the bottom of the polariton gap for infinitesimally small variations of impurity parameters .",
    "this is shown to be caused by a singularity of the density of states in the lower polariton band .",
    "this singularity also provides that the localization of transverse polaritons is most effective near the lower boundary of the gap .",
    "we show that the local polariton states , unlike usual transverse extended states are affected by the interaction with the longitudinal phonon modes .",
    "this interaction narrows the frequency range available for the local polariton states .",
    "we consider below a body centered cubic ( bcc ) dielectric crystal with two oppositely charged ions per each elementary cell .",
    "the interaction between ions is assumed to be a central one . denoting masses of the positive and negative ions as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and their displacements as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 belongs to the positive or negative sublattice , we can write down the equations of stationary lattice vibrations coupled to a coherent electric field , @xmath4 : @xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 denotes an ion charge , @xmath7 is the frequency .    the right - hand side of eq .",

    "when the dispersion of optical phonons is neglected , both polariton branches are monotonic and the spectral gap is between the transverse and longitudinal frequencies , @xmath75  and  @xmath76    it turns out that accounting for the phonon dispersion causes a _ qualitative _ change of this picture .",

    "when a host ion at the site @xmath86 of the positive sublattice is replaced by an impurity ion with the same charge , it causes a local deviation of the crystal density and a local change of elastic constants . to account for these facts we need to add extra forces to the right hand side of eq .",
