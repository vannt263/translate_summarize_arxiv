    "water , the most commonly encountered liquid , exerts both chemical and physical influences on aqueous molecular processes .",
    "hydration effects are often divided into hydrophobic and hydrophilic categories .",
    "hydrophilic solutes are typically ionic or polar species and may participate in chemical interactions with the water solvent . because of the long range of the electrostatic interactions and their strength relative to @xmath0 , hydrophilic hydration presents distinctive conceptual and practical issues for understanding and predicting the influence of hydration on chemical and biochemical events in water .",
    "a principal and long - standing technical issue is the treatment of infinitely long - ranged interactions in the context of a sample of finite size.@xcite recent work has helped to resolve this problem . one algorithmic approach to treatment of long - ranged interactions is the use of ewald interactions within the conventional periodic boundary conditions.@xcite we argue here that _",
    "the ewald approach is an easy way to get correct hydration free energies _ from molecular calculations , that is , to achieve well characterized results appropriate to the thermodynamic limit in which the system size tends to infinity for given densities and temperature .",
    "what is more : molecular simulations with ewald interactions and periodic boundary conditions can also be more efficient than rougher approximations that are often employed to compute hydration free energies for molecularly well - defined problems .",
    "we anticipate results below by noting that we obtain accurate , thermodynamic limiting results for the hydration free energy of imidazole with as few as 16 water molecules included in the simulation .",
    "the price to be paid for this accuracy and efficiency is additional effort in understanding ewald calculations from a physical viewpoint and in implementing ewald interactions,@xcite its equivalents,@xcite and alternatives.@xcite    the physical issues motivating simulation calculations of this type revolve around dielectric continuum models of hydration of ionic and polar solutes.@xcite it is natural and common for a simplified approximation to provide a conceptual baseline for considering more accurate theoretical results .",
    "but the converse comparison is foremost for this work .",
    "the theoretical efforts over recent years have provided sharper tests of the validity of the continuum approach than merely : is an empirically correct hydration free energy obtained ?",
    "recent work has clarified that the dielectric models are simple implementations of thermodynamic perturbation theory through second - order in electrostatic coupling parameters such as solute charges;@xcite dielectric models can also be considered a simple implementation of an _ ansatz _ that electrostatic potential fluctuations are distributed according to a gaussian probability density,@xcite or they can be considered a simplified linear response theory.@xcite    second - order perturbation theory was found to be satisfactory for some solutes such as alkali ions,@xcite but unsatisfactory for water@xcite and anions.@xcite in the latter cases , of course , an _ a posteriori _ adjustment of cavity radii could still produce the correct hydration free energies.@xcite however , the more ambitious molecular theory ties the values of radii parameters to molecular properties that depend on the thermodynamic state of the system ( temperature , pressure , and composition of the solvent ) and to non - electrostatic characteristics of the solute - solvent interactions .",
    "the radii are not separately adjustable when viewed from that deeper level of molecular theory",
    ". however , the radii can be well - defined and are _ not _ properties of the solutes alone but incorporate information about the solvent and thermodynamic state .    for water as a solvent , the case of exclusive concern here ,",
    "the most prominent failings of second - order perturbation theory are associated with solvent proton conformations that lead to non - gaussian fluctuations of electrostatic potentials.@xcite thus , the most favorable cases for the second - order perturbation theories are classic positive ions . in such cases , oxygen - hydrogen bonds of water",
    "are oriented away from the ion .",
    "neutral , polar molecules that may form specific hydrogen bonds with the solvent are more challenging for these theories , though the hydration free energies sought are smaller in magnitude than for typical ions .",
    "negative molecular ions are expected to offer further complications because now the problematic proton interactions with the solute will be strong .",
    "however , we have less experience with realistic negative ions partly because the molecular models used for simulation are less well developed than for other cases .",
    "the appreciation of the different possibilities for fluctuations has led to new theories of electrostatic hydration free energies.@xcite these theories analyze electrostatic distributions more broadly , still using gaussian models at crucial steps ; but now several gaussian distributions are derived from an analysis of the first shell environment of the solute . for the important case of hydration of a water molecule , this extension repairs the breakdown of a single gaussian theory .",
    "negative ions can still be problematic but the multiple gaussian approach has also motivated development of quasi - chemical theories@xcite that are based , in principle , on full information about the thermal motion of the first hydration shell . though experience with the quasi - chemical theories is limited,@xcite we anticipate that they should provide better descriptions of the hydration free energies , in addition to providing a reasonable pathway to carry - out solution phase electronic structure calculations on hydrated negative ions , calculations that would be difficult particularly in the absence of hydration effects .    in the following section",
    ", we will first introduce the model solute imidazole , which was chosen as a molecular solute to exemplify , combine , and extend aspects of ionic and polar solutes studied previously.@xcite results for imidazole and imidazolium will be used throughout the manuscript to illustrate the theoretical issues .",
    "we will discuss the ewald treatment of electrostatic interactions , motivating it in various ways .",
    "subsequently , finite - size effects will be studied .",
    "the correction for the typically large finite - size effects is essential for accurate calculations of solvation free energies of polar and charged solutes . we distinguish between electrostatic finite - size effects that are independent of the thermodynamic state and the characteristics of the solute , and the remaining thermodynamic finite - size effects .",
    "we will then introduce perturbative methods for calculating solvation free energies that are based on the approximately gaussian character of the electrostatic potential fluctuations .",
    "non - gaussian behavior and its accurate treatment using multistate gaussian and quasi - chemical models will be the focus of the last section .",
    "to illustrate the various issues arising in calculations of solvation free energies of charged and polar molecules , we present new calculations of the hydration of imidazole and imidazolium .",
    "we choose this example because recent interest in these problems has focused on predicting acid - base equilibria of biochemical relevance .",
    "we will calculate the charging free energies of the protonated imidazolium and the neutral , polar imidazole ( figure [ fig : imidazole - scheme ] ) .",
    "imidazole in water provides a rich example : the polar imidazole molecule can be protonated at the n@xmath1 position to form a molecular cation , imidazolium .",
    "this protonation reaction has a p@xmath2 of about 7.@xcite it provides a basis for p@xmath2 calculations of ionizable residues of proteins .",
    "imidazole is the building block of histidine , one of the most active amino acids enzymatically and ubiquitous in the active sites of enzymes that operate at room temperature and neutral ph.@xcite    the protonation of imidazole has been studied previously using combinations of dielectric , quantum mechanical , and computer simulation methods.@xcite here , we will focus on the solvation contribution to the protonation equilibrium and reserve quantum mechanical intramolecular effects for subsequent treatment .",
    "the imidazole / imidazolium system is more complex than the systems we have studied before using explicit solvent models : mono- and divalent ions,@xcite water in water,@xcite and tetramethylammonium.@xcite the analysis below should also illustrate how the calculation of solvation free energies using the ewald method and equilibrium fluctuations of electrostatic potentials can be extended to proteins , in particular the calculation of p@xmath2 s of amino acids .    * monte carlo computer simulations of imidazole in water*. we studied the solvation of imidazole [ im(p ) ] and imidazolium [ im(+ ) ] in water using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in the canonical ensemble . for the im(p ) and im(+ ) molecules , we used the partial charges and geometry of topol et al.,@xcite as compiled in table [ tab : imidazole ] . for water , we used the spc / e model.@xcite the temperature was 298 k. the ewald method was used for the long - range electrostatic interactions with a real - space screening factor of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the length of the periodically replicated cubic box .",
    "a cutoff of @xmath5 was applied in fourier space , resulting in @xmath6 @xmath7 vectors being considered .",
    "a cutoff of @xmath8 was applied to the lennard - jones and real - space electrostatic interactions based on atoms .",
    "the background dielectric constant in the ewald method was corrected from infinity to 80.@xcite the partial molar volume of the imidazole was chosen as two times that of bulk water at a density of 997.07 kg / m@xmath9 , such that the pressure@xcite was about one atmosphere .",
    "the metropolis mc method was used to sample configurational space in the simulations.@xcite the translational and rotational move widths of water were chosen to give about 40 % acceptance ratios .",
    "the solute was allowed to move as well .",
    "simulations started from random configurations or configurations of previous runs with different charges , equilibrated for at least 100,000 and 50,000 mc passes , respectively , where one pass is one attempted move for each of the particles .",
    "electrostatic potentials at solute atom positions and binding energies of the solute were calculated after every pass using the ewald method in simulations extending over 200,000 mc passes each .",
    "simulations were performed for the uncharged , half - charged , and fully charged im(p ) and im(+ ) in their respective geometries .",
    "the equilibrium simulations were performed with 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , and 512 water molecules to study finite size effects .    to complete the thermodynamic cycle and",
    "check for consistency , two runs of slow growth thermodynamic integration were used to calculate the free energy of converting the geometry from the uncharged im(p ) to the uncharged im(+ ) conformation within 150,000 mc passes .",
    "six runs of 200,000 mc passes were used to calculate the free energy of converting the polar im(p ) into an im(+ ) cation , starting from different equilibrated configurations and averaging three charging and three uncharging runs .",
    "the thermodynamic integrations were carried out with 256 water molecules .",
    "we will discuss the results of these calculations as they come - up in the theoretical narrative .",
    "however , before considering more subtle issues we can make a direct comparison of the average electrostatic potential exerted by the solvent observed during the simulation with the corresponding predictions of dielectric models .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare ] shows that comparison for several sets of radii in current use .",
    "such a comparison illustrates the basic issue of sensitivity of thermodynamic results to the radii parameters and whether extant empirically adjusted radii are transferable to slightly different cases .",
    "viewed from an historical perspective , the most appropriate treatment of electrostatic interactions for simulation calculations has been a contentious issue . in this setting",
    "it is helpful to note some broad , and non - technical , characteristics of ewald treatments that might be typically overlooked .",
    "we preface these observations by noting that simulation calculations treat finite systems .",
    "most commonly , periodic ( or born - von karman ) boundary conditions @xcite are utilized for the exterior boundary of the finite system considered .",
    "the theoretical issues engendered by these boundary conditions with finite - ranged@xcite and long - ranged interactions are reasonably well understood .",
    "of course , simulation calculations need not address issues of what is happening outside the simulation cell .",
    "we note that it is possible to compute the ewald potential  and in more than one way  without consideration of image charges outside the simulation cell .",
    "so intuitive arguments based upon image charges can be avoided completely .",
    "it is convenient to express the ewald electrostatic energy of a system of partial charges @xmath10 at positions @xmath11 on molecules @xmath12 as a sum of effective pair interactions and self terms , @xmath13\\nonumber\\\\ & &   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i }    \\sum_{\\alpha } { q_{i\\alpha}}^2 \\lim_{{\\bf r}\\rightarrow 0 }    \\left[\\varphi({\\bf r})-\\frac{1}{|{\\bf r}|}\\right]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 .",

    "the ewald potential @xmath16 is the solution of the poisson equation that is periodic with the fundamental period of the simulation cell*.@xcite a periodic solution of the poisson equation requires that the surface integral of the electric field normal to the surface of the simulation cell be zero .",
    "this means that the material in the simulation cell must have zero net electric charge .",
    "if the physical system of interest is non - neutral , a uniform background distribution of charge is included to neutralize the non - zero charge of the physical system .",
    "consider an elementary charge . because the ewald potential is periodic",
    ", we can consider the ewald electrostatic potential implied by centering the simulation cell on this elementary charge . by symmetry",
    "the ewald normal electric field is zero on the cell boundary .",
    "the ewald potential can thus be considered to be that of a cut - off on the cell boundary  the cut - off at the maximum distances achievable  with zero normal derivative analogous to a shifted - force correction .",
    "* the ewald potential pushes the electrostatic boundary outward as far as possible but still retains smoothness on the boundary*. the minimum image cut - off shares with the ewald treatment the property that the electrostatic potential is not cut - off in any region of the simulation volume , the largest volume that must be physically considered .",
    "however , as demonstrated above , the ewald potential is smooth on that boundary since it is the periodic solution of the poisson equation .",
    "this is an important technical advantage that facilitates investigation of system size dependence of computed properties , _",
    "i.e. _ , the variation of system properties with variations of the cell boundaries . in those cases where the physical system of interest is non - neutral it is a helpful point of view that the background charge density is a simple device that permits smoothness of the computed potential on the system boundary .",
    "we emphasize that the effect of the neutralizing background charge disappears as the thermodynamic limit is approached , in which the background charge density disappears .",
    "* reaction field potentials are ewald potentials for different background charges .",
    "* reaction field methods@xcite are computationally efficient alternatives to ewald summation .",
    "the effective potentials of the site - site reaction field ( ssrf ) method@xcite and the generalized reaction field ( grf ) method@xcite can be viewed as ewald potentials for a non - homogeneous background charge .",
    "the ssrf and grf potentials are the solutions to the poisson equation for a source charge and a compensating background . the background charge densities in the ssrf and grf method are that of a homogeneous sphere and a radially symmetric charge distribution centered around the source charge , respectively .",
    "the ssrf and grf method have a finite range because of the radially symmetric background charge densities that exactly compensate the source charge when the cut - off distance is reached .",
    "* comparison of ewald potentials from simulation of water to electrostatic potentials in isolated water droplets*. it is interesting to make some simple numerical comparisons between the ewald potentials that are experienced in simulation of water with periodic boundary conditions to the corresponding electrostatic potentials in water droplets .",
    "such a comparison is simplified if we locate a distinguished solute at the origin of our cartesian coordinate system . for a spherical lennard - jones solute ,",
    "figure  [ fig : cluster ] shows a typical variation of the electrostatic potential at the solute center with inclusion of the charge density in progressively larger spherical volumes of radius @xmath32 around the solute .",
    "notice the substantial variation of the electrostatic potential with inclusion of the solvation shells near the solute .",
    "however , after about three shells the net electrostatic potential oscillates about the ewald asymptotic value before the ball penetrates the physical interface of the droplet .",
    "thereafter , the net electrostatic potential displays the effects of the surface polarization of the droplet as it makes a transition to the very different value that characterizes the whole droplet .",
    "it is clear in this case that the ewald potential faithfully captures this interior potential while avoiding detailed considerations of the droplet interface .    * single ion hydration",
    "free energies are well - defined within molecular simulations*. electrostatic potentials can be defined unambiguously as solutions of the poisson equation with specified charge densities and boundary conditions .",
    "electrostatic potentials are computed throughout simulations of aqueous solutions even if charge densities and boundary conditions may not be specified explicitly .",
    "if the system of interest is non - neutral , these issues deserve emphasis because single ion free energies are typically not measured experimentally .    on a molecular scale ,",
    "dependences on specifics of the boundary conditions in the definition of single ion hydration free energies can be avoided .",
    "this is accomplished by spherically integrating the electrostatic potential over the charge density around a charge site up to a distance where that potential saturates .",
    "using ewald interactions corresponds to such a spherical integration.@xcite figure  [ fig : cluster ] shows results for electrostatic potentials obtained using two different choices for the boundary conditions  a solute - water cluster and a periodic system .",

    "computer simulations are performed for a finite system of molecules . in most applications , the properties of the thermodynamic - limit , infinite system are sought . in coulombic systems , pronounced finite - size effects are ubiquitous due to the long range of the interactions .",
    "we can separate finite - size effects in coulombic systems into two categories : ( 1 ) those caused purely by the long - range electrostatics independent of the thermodynamic state ; and ( 2 ) finite size effects that depend on the thermodynamic state ( temperature , pressure , etc . ) .",
    "the electrostatic finite - size effects in the ewald treatment of coulomb interactions arise from self - interactions and interactions with the neutralizing background essential for non - neutral systems under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "electrostatic finite - size effects can be treated exactly by including the second and third sum in the electrostatic energy @xmath28 of the solute eq  [ eq : uew_sol ] , which account for self - interactions of the solute.@xcite for an ion of charge @xmath33 , the resulting correction to the solvation chemical potential is@xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the chemical potential for charging the ion from zero charge to net charge @xmath33 calculated from the ewald interactions with the solvent excluding self - interactions ( _ i.e. _ , including only the first sum in eq  [ eq : uew_sol ] ) ; @xmath36 includes the self - interactions ; and @xmath37 is the ionic self - term . for a cubic box of length @xmath4 , we have @xmath38 .",

    "figure  [ fig : df ] illustrates the finite size effects for the free energies of charging im(p ) and im(+ ) after correction for ewald self - interactions .",
    "free energies were calculated from sixth - order integration formulas with corrected means and variances from table  [ tab : im_ave_var ] that include the electrostatic@xcite but not the thermodynamic finite - size correction .",
    "the free energy is plotted as a function of @xmath49 where @xmath4 is the box length .",
    "we find that the free energy of charging the polar im(p ) is independent of the system size within the statistical errors of about 1 kj / mol for @xmath50 to @xmath51 water molecules .",
    "however , the free energy of charging the im(+ ) cation shows a system size dependence proportional to @xmath49 , as would be expected from our finite size analysis.@xcite rather than using a more realistic shape of the molecule in the dielectric model of ref  , we fit the observed free energies to to the spherical born model eq  [ eq : born ] with an effective radius @xmath52 nm and an infinite dielectric constant which reproduces the data over the whole range of system sizes of @xmath53 water molecules .    to further illustrate the power of the finite - size corrections , figure  [ fig : collapse ] shows the probability distributions of electrostatic interaction energies @xmath28 of the imidazolium cation im(+ ) with the @xmath54 water molecules eq  [ eq : uew_sol ] .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : collapse ] are the corresponding gaussian distributions , which nicely reproduce the calculated histograms of @xmath28 .",
    "however , we observe a strong system size dependence : small systems have narrower distributions of @xmath28 with less negative averages compared to large systems .",
    "when we apply the electrostatic and thermodynamic finite size corrections for the mean and average , the gaussian distributions `` collapse '' to a single distribution corresponding to the limit of an infinite system size .",
    "we note that the finite - size correction is large : for @xmath50 water molecules , the average @xmath28 changes by about @xmath55 kj / mol ( 250 @xmath0 ) .",

    "however , changing conditions may result in reweighting of slightly accessible basins or the opening of new basins .",
    "the gaussian or dielectric models may fail to describe these possibilities well .",
    "this picture is physically better defined than the commonly nonspecific discussions of electrostriction and dielectric saturation .",
    "a corresponding `` multistate gaussian model '' was developed in ref  .",
    "attention is directed to the thermal probability distribution of electrostatic potential energies of the solute . rather than approximating this distribution as a single gaussian distribution , perhaps with perturbative corrections , we discriminate hydration structure on the basis of simple parameters diagnostic of hydration substates .",
    "we assume that the probability distribution of electrostatic potential energies is gaussian for each substate .",
    "therefore the full distribution is a superposition of gaussian distributions for the various substates .",
    "thus we attempt to represent the observed complicating features of @xmath63 by a combination of simpler states : @xmath84 with weights @xmath85 and normalized densities @xmath86 .",
    "we will seek @xmath87 s of gaussian form , representing the overall system as a linear combination of gaussian subsystems , each showing linear response to electrostatic interactions .",
    "representing @xmath63 by a sum of gaussian densities can give nontrivial results for the chemical potential , as can be seen by substituting eq  [ eq : expansion ] into eq  [ eq : mu_exp ] , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the mean and variance of the gaussian @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "the non - gaussian fluctuations of the electrostatic potential in liquid water are associated with changes in the conformations of protons that make hydrogen bonds to the solute .",
    "if those fluctuations could be tempered , a gaussian model might become more accurate .",
    "thus , suitable substate diagnostic parameters are the number of hydrogen bonds made to the solute .",
    "explicit calculations have shown that this approach eliminates most of the detailed numerical inaccuracies of the gaussian fluctuation models for hydration of a water molecule in liquid water.@xcite the markedly non - gaussian @xmath63 was accurately represented as the sum of gaussian distributions implied by this definition of a hydration substate .",
    "we found @xmath92 for @xmath93 with 3.64 being the average number of neighbors and @xmath94 the most probable number of neighbors .",
    "the calculated change of the chemical potential upon change of the charge state of a solute water molecule is correct to within 5 % .",
    "this is a remarkable result because @xmath59 is non - quadratic , requiring an eighth - order polynomial to fit the simulation data for chemical - potential derivatives.@xcite this shows that sufficient information can be extracted from the simulation to describe the distribution @xmath63 helpfully ; and that such an approach can be successful even for perturbations involving changes of the chemical potential as large as 14  @xmath0 .",
    "similar behavior can be anticipated for hydration of other neutral , polar solutes such as the imidazole example studied here .",
    "figure  [ fig : taylor ] ( inset ) shows the results of the multistate gaussian model applied to charging and uncharging the polar imidazole im(p ) .",
    "fluctuation data were collected from a simulation of the uncharged and charged im(p ) in @xmath95 water molecules , extending over @xmath96 mc passes to allow for error estimates . instead of determining the overall mean and variance of the electrostatic potential for a second - order perturbation expansion , we calculate the means and variances for several gaussian distributions from structures sorted according to the number of hydrogen bonds",
    ". inspection of the radial distribution functions of water oxygen and hydrogen around imidazole sites shows one strong hydrogen bond donor , h1 , and one acceptor , n3 . as a criterion for the formation of a water - imidazole hydrogen bond",
    ", we used that the distance between the acceptor ( nitrogen n3 or water oxygen ) and the donor hydrogen has to be smaller than 0.23 nm .",
    "we can then sort structures according to the numbers of hydrogen bonds accepted and donated by the solute . with this simple criterion , we find that six and two gaussian distributions contribute to the expansions about the charged and uncharged state of im(p ) , respectively .",
    "this multistate gaussian model greatly improves the quality of the expansions , both about the charged and uncharged state .",
    "the reference free energy is now within the statistical errors of the two multistate gaussian models over the whole range @xmath97 .",
    "* quasi - chemical theories*. those more difficult anionic cases mentioned above can be attacked more directly .",
    "the local neighborhood is again used to discriminate structural possibilities .",
    "but , in addition , the consequences for the hydration free energy of the molecular interactions within that neighborhood are treated fully .",
    "this reserves the longer - ranged interactions for simple approximations , _",
    "e.g. _ with gaussian models .",
    "these theoretical developments arose from recent molecular calculations@xcite that suggested how a chemical perspective can be helpful in computing thermodynamic properties of water and aqueous solutions .",
    "that calculation used electronic structure results on the fe(h@xmath98o)@xmath99 cluster and simple , physical estimates of further solvation effects .",
    "the results were organized according to the pattern of a simple chemical reaction and a surprisingly accurate evaluation of the hydration free energy was obtained . despite this recent motivation , the theories developed are akin to good approximations of historical and pedagogical importance in the areas of cooperative phenomena and phase transitions.@xcite in those areas , similar approximations are called guggenheim , quasi - chemical , or bethe approximations .    these quasi - chemical theories@xcite are constructed by considering a geometric volume fixed on the solute molecule and performing a calculation analogous to the evaluation of a grand canonical partition function for that volume .",
    "all the possibilities for occupancy of that volume by solvent or other solution species must be considered eventually .",
    "the final result can be described by reference to simple patterns of chemical equilibria such as : @xmath100 the solute of interest is denoted here generically as @xmath101 ; a star - type cluster of that solute with @xmath102 water ( w ) molecules is considered as the product .",
    "for such a cluster , call it an m - cluster , we could calculate the equilibrium ratio @xmath103 for a dilute gas phase .",
    "note that @xmath104 is dimensionless and this observation resolves standard state issues .",
    "the factors denoted by @xmath105 , where @xmath106 indicates either a water molecule or the m - cluster , carry information about solvation free energy of the species involved .",
    "for the species other than the cluster this is the familiar widom factor . for the cluster ,",
    "this factor requires slight additional restriction but can be verbally defined by saying that it is the average of the boltzmann factor for cluster - solution interactions over the thermal motion of the cluster and solution under the condition that the only interactions between these subsystems rigidly exclude additional solvent molecules from the cluster volume for the complex .",
    "this restriction enforces a constraint required to preserve simple enumerations that underlie these results .",
    "the theoretical structure is designed so that simple approximations such as dielectric models might be used for the factors @xmath105 . but",
    "more detailed techniques might be applied to the calculation of @xmath103 .",
    "finally , we compile @xmath107^n } ~. \\label{k - tilde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , this @xmath108 is built on the pattern of the chemical equilibrium eq [ equilibrium ] but without a ` solvation factor ' for the ` bare ' solute .",
    "now consider all possibilities for clusters .",
    "a thermodynamic implication of this information is : @xmath109 - kt \\ln [ p_0 \\sum_{m } { \\tilde k}_m \\rho_w{}^n ] .",
    "\\label{answer6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath110 is the probability that the clustering volume would be observed to be _ empty _ in the equilibrium solution ; thus @xmath111 is the free energy for formation of a cavity for the clustering volume in the solution .",
    "the sum is over all clusters with zero or more ligands .",
    "the product of the densities involved with each term includes a density factor for each ligand .",
    "this formula makes the conventional separation between the contributions of intermolecular interactions and the non - interaction ( ideal ) terms ; @xmath112 is the partition function of the bare solute in the absence of interactions with any other species and @xmath113 is the density of the solute . as an example , for an atomic ion such as the chloride ion cl@xmath114 we would put @xmath115 with @xmath116 the volume of the system and @xmath117 the thermal debroglie wavelength of the chloride ion .",
    "this formula becomes approximate when approximate models are adopted for @xmath110 , for @xmath103 , and for the solvation factors .",
    "those quantities depend on definition of the clustering volume .",
    "but , since the physical problem is independent of those parameters , the theory should be insensitive to them .",
    "the motivation of this approach is the fact that a substantial but intricate part of the free energy sought is to be found in @xmath103 .",
    "the number of possibilities for ligand populations will be small for molecular scale clustering volumes . so a limited number of terms must be considered .",
    "because the clusters will be small systems , elaborate computational methods can be applied to the prediction of the @xmath103 , including current electronic structure techniques . with the complicated chemical interactions separated for individual treatment",
    "the remaining hydration contributions should be simpler and the required theories better controlled .",
    "equation [ answer6 ] should be compared with eq  [ eq : mu_gn ] .",
    "one difference is that eq [ answer6 ] attempts to provide the whole hydration free energy , not just the part due to electrostatic interactions . that explains the presence of @xmath110 in eq [ answer6 ] .",
    "beyond that , the structures of these formulas are similar .",
    "the presence of more than one term in the sum of eq [ answer6 ] is an expression of an entropy contribution associated with the possibilities for different ligand populations .",
    "finally , the complete calculation of the @xmath103 includes non - gaussian statistical possibilities not anticipated by eq  [ eq : mu_gn ] .",
    "recent calculations of the hydration free energy due to electrostatic interactions between charged and polar solutes in water have obtained high accuracy results for the simple molecular models that are the basis of most simulation calculations .",
    "an important step in securing those high accuracy results has been a careful consideration of treatment of long - ranged interactions .",
    "that work suggests that _ the ewald method is an easy way to get correct hydration free energies _ from molecular calculations , that is , to achieve well characterized results appropriate to the thermodynamic limit in which the system size tends to infinity for given densities and temperature .",
    "additionally , it suggests that molecular simulations with ewald potentials and periodic boundary conditions can have efficiencies comparable to rougher approximations that are often employed to compute hydration free energies for molecularly well - defined problems.@xcite and furthermore , this has produced a simple , effective , and clear understanding of how to extrapolate electrostatic hydration free energies to the thermodynamic limit ; an accurate evaluation of the hydration free energies of imidazole and imidazolium can be obtained with as few as 16 water molecules included in the simulation .",
    "these high accuracy results for well - defined models permitted careful testing of simple theories of electrostatic hydration free energies .",
    "the simplest theories , dielectric continuum models , have been found to be rough despite the fact that they can always be adjusted to reproduce an empirical answer given _ a priori .",
    "_ such a conclusion has surely been widely expected .",
    "however , the testing has led to new theories , the multistate gaussian and quasi - chemical theories , that should permit more revealing molecular scale calculations .",
    "the quasi - chemical approaches seem to provide the most natural way to utilize current electronic structure packages to study electronic structure issues for solution species .",
    "this should be particularly helpful for treatment of basic , molecular anions that are ubiquitous in aqueous solution chemistry .",
    "physical conclusions more specifically are that the most prominent failings of the simplest theories are associated with solvent proton conformations that lead to non - gaussian fluctuations of electrostatic potentials . thus , the most favorable cases for the second - order perturbation theories are monoatomic positive ions . in such cases ,",
    "oxygen - hydrogen bonds are oriented away from the ion , placing those protons as far out as possible .",
    "neutral , polar molecules that may form specific hydrogen bonds with the solvent are more difficult for these theories , though the hydration free energies sought are smaller in magnitude .",
    "negative molecular ions are expected to offer further complications because now the problematic proton motions occur close to the solute and the hydration effects will be larger for anionic species .",
    "this work was supported by the ldrd program at los alamos .",
