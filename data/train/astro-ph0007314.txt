    "the h   region abundances provide important observational constraints to test models of stellar evolution , models of the chemical evolution of galaxies , and models of the evolution of the universe as a whole .",
    "reviews on the abundances of galactic and extragalactic h   regions have been presented before ( e. g. , @xcite ; ) .",
    "from emission line spectra of galactic and extragalactic h   regions it is possible to determine abundance ratios , good quality spectra usually permit to derive electron temperatures like @xmath3(o  ) and @xmath3(n  ) from the [ o  ] 4363/5007 and [ n  ] 5755/6584 line ratios .",
    "often only @xmath3(o  ) is available and to estimate the temperature of the regions of low degree of ionization photoionization models have been used .",
    "for example , to determine @xmath3(o  ) , , and have used the models by that provide a @xmath3(o  ) versus @xmath3(o  ) relationship .",
    "photoionization models have been used also to estimate the ionization correction factor for those elements that have not been observed in all the stages of ionization present in the nebulae .",
    "there are other methods to determine the electron temperature , like : the ratio of the balmer continuum to a balmer line , the ratio of he  /h   lines , and the ratio of recombination lines of c   and o   to forbidden lines of [ c  ] and [ o  ] ; these other methods usually yield electron temperatures substantially smaller than those provided by @xmath3(o  ) ( e.g. ; , @xcite ; ) .",
    "several explanations have been proposed for the @xmath3 differences , the main ones are : temperature variations , density variations , and chemical inhomogeneities ( e.g. , @xcite ; ; ; ) .",
    "recent discussions on this subject have been presented by , @xcite ( @xcite ) , and .",
    "detailed photoionization models of i  zw  18 , ngc  2363 , and ngc  346 yield @xmath3(o  ) values from 10% to 15% smaller than observed , probably indicating that there are additional heating sources not considered by the models , like the deposition of mechanical energy (; ; ) .",
    "the differences in @xmath3 should be taken into account to derive accurate abundance ratios .",
    "to derive accurate he / h abundance ratios it is necessary to use accurate temperatures and densities . due to the collisional contribution to the he   line intensities the higher the density the lower",
    "the computed he / h ratio . due to the density variations present in h   regions",
    "it is well known that @xmath4(rms ) is smaller than the densities derived from the ratio of two forbidden lines , in general it can be shown that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the filling factor and for giant extragalactic h   regions is typically of the order of 0.01 .",
    "consequently the use of @xmath4(rms ) yields a higher limit to the he / h ratio .    for some objects",
    "only the @xmath4 derived from the [ s  ] lines is available and therefore the @xmath4(s  ) density has been used to determine the he / h ratio . pointed out that the region where the [ s  ] lines originate is not representative of the region where the he   lines originate , and proposed to determine self consistently the density from five of the best observed he   lines , adopting @xmath3(o  ) as the representative temperature for the regions where the he   and h   lines originate .",
    "most he / h determinations have been made by adopting @xmath3(o  ) .",
    "@xmath3(o  ) provides us with an upper limit to @xmath3(he  ) for the two following reasons : a ) for metal poor h   regions @xmath3(o  @xmath7(o  ) , and the he   lines originate both in the o   and the o   zones , b ) even if the [ o  ] and the he   lines originate in the same zone , in the presence of temperature variations it can be shown that @xmath3(o  @xmath7(he  ) .    from nine he   lines of ngc  346 , the brightest h   region in the small magellanic cloud , derived self - consistently @xmath4(he  ) , he / h , and @xmath3(he  ) .",
    "they derived a @xmath3(he  ) value 9% smaller than @xmath3(o  ) .",
    "the maximum likelihood method implies that the lower the temperature the higher the density and the lower the derived he / h ratio , this is a systematic effect and implies that the he / h ratios derived from @xmath3(o  ) are upper limits to the real he / h value . from photoionization models of giant h   regions based on cloudy @xcite",
    "it is found that @xmath3(he  ) is from 3% to 12% smaller than @xmath3(o  ) @xcite .",
    "the abundances of the sun and the orion nebula have been used as probes of galactic chemical evolution and as standards for stars and gaseous nebulae of the solar vicinity .",
    "therefore it is important to compare them since they have been derived using different methods .",
    "a decade ago the o / h difference between the sun and the orion nebula in the literature amounted to 0.44dex , at present the difference is only of 0.11dex ( see table  [ to / h ] ) .",
    "the change is due to two recent results for orion and one for the sun : a ) the 0.15dex increase in the o / h value derived from recombination lines ( which implies a @xmath8 ) relative to that derived from forbidden lines under the assumption of @xmath9 , b ) the increase of 0.08dex due to the fraction of oxygen embedded in dust grains , and c ) the decrease of 0.10dex due to a new solar determination .",
