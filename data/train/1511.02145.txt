    "structures and relations in algebra and representation theory are sometimes `` explained '' by geometric or topological facts , frequently by facts concerning a category of low - dimensional geometric or topological objects .",
    "as a first illustration , consider the following well - known example of an algebraic relation .",
    "let @xmath0 be a set .",
    "a map @xmath1 is called _ associative _ if for any integer @xmath2 and any given @xmath3-tuple @xmath4 , every way of putting brackets in the expression @xmath5 gives , upon applying @xmath6 repeatedly according to the chosen bracketing , one and the same element of @xmath0 .",
    "this is not the typical the textbook definition of associativity ; the latter is rather based on the    a map @xmath1 is associative if and only if the equality @xmath7 holds for all triples @xmath8 .",
    "it should be appreciated that this is really an assertion about binary trees with a finite number of leaves .",
    "indeed , any bracketing of @xmath3 elements corresponds to a binary tree with @xmath3 leaves .",
    "the statement then follows from the observation that any two binary trees can be transformed into each other by applying repeatedly a move that amounts to the associativity relation . in this sense , a combinatorial property of the collection of all binary trees `` explains '' the textbook definition of associativity .    to give an example of",
    "a structure `` explained '' or , rather , justified , by facts from geometry and related to quantum field theory , consider the symmetric monoidal category @xmath9 of smooth oriented cobordisms .",
    "the objects of @xmath9 are finite disjoint unions of oriented circles @xmath10 , and its morphisms are diffeomorphism classes of smooth oriented surfaces with boundary . one way to learn more about the category @xmath9 is to _ represent _ it on a symmetric monoidal category @xmath11 , i.e.  to study symmetric monoidal functors @xmath12 .",
    "( an important example is @xmath13 , the category of vector spaces over a field @xmath14 . )",
    "such a representation @xmath15 of the category @xmath9 is called a ( 2,1)-dimensional topological field theory .    for the rest of this section",
    "we restrict our attention to @xmath14-linear representations , with @xmath14 a field , i.e  to the case of @xmath13 .",
    "representations can be constructed using generators and relations for the object to be represented .",
    "the category @xmath9 admits such a description in terms of generators and relations , given by the pair - of - pants decomposition of riemann surfaces with boundary . as a consequence , it suffices to know the vector space @xmath16 associated to the circle together with the linear maps @xmath17 and @xmath18@xmath19 that are obtained from the three - punctured sphere regarded as a cobordism @xmath20 and as @xmath21 , respectively , as well as the maps @xmath22 and @xmath23 obtained from the disk , seen as a cobordism @xmath24 and as @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g.  the textbook @xcite ) that the relations in the pair - of - pants decompositions imply that @xmath26 is a commutative frobenius algebra over @xmath14 . in this sense ,",
    "the structure of @xmath9 together with the idea , inspired from quantum field theory , to study representations of @xmath9 , enforce on us the algebraic notion of a commutative frobenius algebra ( which was , of course , a known structure long before the advent of topological field theory ) .",
    "the result amounts to a classification of topological field theories , which are objects in the functor category @xmath27 :    the evaluation on the circle provides an equivalence @xmath28 of categories , where @xmath29 is the groupoid of commutative frobenius algebras over the field @xmath14 .",
    "non - commutative frobenius algebras and their representation categories can be obtained in a similar spirit when one allows for a larger geometric category @xmath30 that has as objects disjoint unions of circles as well as intervals .",
    "one then obtains a so - called open / closed topological field theory . for details",
    ", we refer to @xcite .    in the sequel we will present a small , and strongly biased by personal taste , digest of instances in which the interplay of geometric and algebraic structures has lead to a mathematical insight .",
    "all those instances are , in some way , related to the priority programme `` representation theory '' .",
    "next we present a more recent example for how topological field theory can `` explain '' a classical fact from algebra .",
    "the following statements about a finite - dimensional hopf algebra @xmath33 over a field @xmath14 can be found in any textbook on hopf algebras .",
    "the hopf algebra @xmath33 has a one - dimensional subspace @xmath34 of left integrals , with @xmath35 the counit of @xmath33 . by associativity , for @xmath36 and any @xmath37 ,",
    "the element @xmath38 is again a left integral of @xmath33 .",
    "since the space of integrals is one - dimensional , this in turn implies the existence of a linear form @xmath39 satisfying @xmath40 for any @xmath41 .",
    "this linear form is a morphism of algebras and thus a group - like element of @xmath42 . by applying the same reasoning to the dual hopf algebra @xmath42",
    "one finds analogously a distinguished group - like element @xmath43 . a classical result by radford is    let @xmath33 be a finite - dimensional hopf algebra over a field @xmath14 , and let @xmath43 and @xmath39 be the distinguished group - like elements .",
    "then the fourth power of the antipode @xmath44 of @xmath33 satisfies @xmath45 for all @xmath46 .",
    "here the symbol @xmath47 denotes the left action of @xmath42 on @xmath33 which , using the sweedler notation @xmath48 for the coproduct of @xmath33 , is given by @xmath49 , and analogously @xmath50 is the right @xmath42-action on @xmath33 .",
    "there is a purely algebraic proof for the purely algebraic statement in theorem 2.1 .",
    "the statement admits a categorical reformulation . consider a finite tensor category @xmath51 , i.e.  an abelian rigid tensor category over a field @xmath14 in which the monoidal unit is simple and which obeys several finiteness conditions ( finite - dimensional morphism spaces , finite jordan - hlder length for any object , and finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects each of which has a projective cover ) . as an example , take the rigid monoidal category @xmath52-mod of finite - dimensional modules over a finite - dimensional hopf algebra @xmath33 .",
    "the group - like element @xmath53 is a morphism of algebras and thus defines an invertible object @xmath54 in @xmath52-mod .",
    "such an invertible object can be introduced for any finite tensor category ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma2.9 ) . taking into account that the left dual of a module @xmath55-mod is given by @xmath56 and the right dual of @xmath57 by @xmath58 , radford",
    "s theorem amounts to a relation between the double duals @xmath59 and @xmath60 in @xmath52-mod .",
    "indeed , the assertion in theorem 2.1 generalizes @xcite to the following purely categorical statement :    let @xmath51 be a finite tensor category . then there is a natural isomorphism @xmath61 of monoidal functors .",
    "a proof of this statement can be given entirely in a category theoretic setting , see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect.5.2 ) .",
    "we now outline how the theorem can be `` understood '' in the framework of topological field theories .",
    "the definition of a topological field theory as a symmetric monoidal functor can be extended to other cobordism categories , and to higher - categorical versions of cobordism categories . in a rather general framework",
    "one can consider an @xmath62-category @xmath63 of @xmath3-dimensional framed cobordisms , with objects being @xmath3-framed points , 1-morphisms @xmath3-framed 1-manifolds with boundary , 2-morphisms @xmath3-framed 2-manifolds with corners , etc .",
    "for @xmath64 , all @xmath65-morphisms are invertible .",
    "a topological field theory with values in @xmath11 is then a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath66 , with @xmath11 a symmetric monoidal @xmath62-category .",
    "the same reasoning that shows that the vector space carries additional structure can be used to see that @xmath67 , the object assigned to a point , has special properties . the cobordism theorem @xcite states that @xmath67 is a fully dualizable object in @xmath11 and that any such object determines a framed topological field theory .",
    "there is an equivalence @xmath68\\ ] ] of @xmath69-groupoids generalizing ( [ frobequiv ] ) , where on the right hand side the symbol @xmath65 indicates that one discards all non - invertible morphisms in the full subcategory of fully dualizable objects of @xmath11 .",
    "we now focus on three - dimensional topological field theories .",
    "an important target @xmath11 is then the symmetric monoidal 3-category @xmath70 which has finite tensor categories as objects , bimodule categories over finite tensor categories as 1-morphisms , and bimodule functors and bimodule natural transformations as 2- and 3-morphisms , respectively .",
    "a fusion category , i.e.  a semisimple finite tensor category , is a fully dualizable object in @xmath70 and thus determines a framed three - dimensional topological field theory .",
    "now by change of framing , the orthogonal group @xmath71 acts on @xmath72 and thus on the functor category @xmath73 .",
    "this translates into a homotopy action of @xmath71 on the fully dualizable objects , i.e.  on fusion categories : points in @xmath71 give self - equivalences @xmath74 \\,{\\to}\\ , k[\\mathcal bimod^{\\mathrm{f.d.}}]$ ] , paths in @xmath71 give natural transformations between self - equivalences , etc .",
    "the homotopy groups of the lie group @xmath71 are well - known : the group of connected components is @xmath75 ; the non - trivial component acts on monoidal categories as @xmath76 .",
    "the fundamental group is @xmath77 ; its non - trivial element acts on fusion categories as an autoequivalence , which turns out @xcite to be given by the bidual @xmath78 .",
    "thus from the group - theoretical fact that the non - trivial element of @xmath77 has order 2 one concludes that the quadruple dual @xmath79 is trivial , which in turn can be seen to imply radford s theorem for fusion categories .",
    "( further , there are weakenings on the side of topological field theories which allow one to make statements about the quadruple dual of finite tensor categories , see @xcite . ) in this way , topological field theory provides a highly surprising connection between homotopy groups of lie groups and radford s @xmath31-theorem for finite - dimensional hopf algebras .",
    "in the previous section we used topological field theories in three dimensions that are fully extended , i.e.  down to the point . in the sequel we study a different variant of three - dimensional topological field theories , which is only extended down to one - dimensional manifolds .",
    "it is of independent interest for representation theory .",
    "consider the symmetric monoidal bicategory @xmath80 whose objects are closed oriented smooth one - dimensional manifolds , 1-morphisms are oriented surfaces with boundary and 2-morphisms are oriented three - manifolds with corners . to represent this bicategory ,",
    "consider a symmetric monoidal 2-functor @xmath81@xmath82 with values in a symmetric monoidal bicategory @xmath11 : this is a called a 3 - 2 - 1-extended topological field theory .",
    "one possible , and particularly important , choice for @xmath11 is the symmetric monoidal bicategory @xmath83-@xmath84 of so - called 2-vector spaces , which has finite semisimple @xmath14-linear abelian categories as objects , @xmath14-linear functors as 1-morphisms and natural transformations as 2-morphisms .    in analogy to the situation with @xmath9 , the category @xmath85",
    "is endowed with additional algebraic structure , and that structure should determine the three - dimensional topological field theory . analyzing this structure on @xmath85 with the help of a presentation of @xmath80 in terms of generators and relations @xcite , the category @xmath85 turns out to be a modular tensor category , i.e.   a braided monoidal semisimple category , together with dualities and a ribbon twist , with non - degenerate braiding .",
    "the non - degeneracy condition on the braiding can be formulated in several equivalent ways . a converse statement , that a modular tensor category determines a 3 - 2 - 1-extended topological field theory ,",
    "has already been established long ago @xcite .",
    "topological field theory thus suggests to regard modular tensor categories as a categorified notion of ( semisimple ) commutative frobenius algebras .",
    "this is indeed a fruitful point of view .",
    "there are several representation - theoretic sources of modular tensor categories : +    * left modules over a connected factorizable ribbon weak hopf algebra with haar integral over an algebraically closed field @xcite . * local sectors of a net of von neumann algebras on @xmath86 that has finite @xmath87-index and is strongly additive and split @xcite .",
    "* representations of a selfdual @xmath88-cofinite vertex algebra with an additional finiteness condition on the homogeneous components and with semisimple representation category @xcite .     + ( the last two items constitute different mathematical formalizations of chiral conformal field theories . ) despite these many sources , modular tensor categories are `` rare '' objects . as a potential further source of modular tensor categories , crossed modules of finite groups have been proposed @xcite some time ago .",
    "a crossed module consists of two finite groups @xmath89 and @xmath90 , an action of @xmath90 on @xmath89 by group automorphisms , and a group homomorphism @xmath91 such that @xmath92 for all @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "these data determine a braided monoidal category @xmath95 whose objects are @xmath89-graded finite - dimensional vector spaces carrying an action of @xmath90 such that @xmath96 , with the braiding given by @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 homogeneous elements of degree @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "the category @xmath95 is a premodular tensor category , i.e.  has all the properties of a modular tensor category except that the braiding may be degenerate .",
    "it is modular if and only if @xmath101 is an isomorphism , in which case one obtains the representation category of the double of a finite group , i.e.  an already known type of modular tensor category . in the general case",
    "the category can be modularized according to a standard procedure @xcite .",
    "somewhat disappointingly , also this modularization turns out to be braided equivalent to the representation category of the drinfeld double of a finite group .",
    "the modularization leads to a category with a certain weak group action , suggesting that it is actually the neutral part of an equivariant modular category @xcite . to find equivariant extensions of a given modular tensor category @xmath51",
    "is an interesting algebraic problem with deep links to the brauer - picard group @xcite of @xmath51 .",
    "again topological field theory , in this case a twisted version of dijkgraaf - witten theories , provides one solution to this algebraic problem .    as a simplifying assumption ,",
    "let us suppose that the group homomorphism @xmath91 appearing in the crossed module of finite groups is an injective group homomorphism , so that the group @xmath89 is a normal subgroup of @xmath90 .",
    "the corresponding sequence @xmath102 of groups is not necessarily split .",
    "but still the group @xmath103 acts weakly on @xmath89 , which can be seen as follows .",

    "a combination of field - theoretic and geometric arguments allows one to recover pure algebraic results @xcite on module categories over the fusion category of finite - dimensional vector spaces that are graded by a finite group .",
    "the program , initiated by andruskiewitsch and schneider , of classifying finite - dimensional pointed hopf algebras over a field has grown into one of the more remarkable recent developments in algebra ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "one of the surprises that were encountered in the realization of this program is a close connection between pointed hopf algebras and lie theory .",
    "the crucial ingredient of this connection is the theory of weyl groupoids ( see @xcite , as well as @xcite ) .    in this groupoid",
    "a construction is central that , while being purely algebraic , turns out to have important ramifications in topological field theory . in the form",
    "introduced originally @xcite , this construction makes extensive use of smash products ; a convenient formulation in the framework of braided monoidal categories proceeds as follows .",
    "we first summarize a few facts that are needed in the construction @xcite :    * the notions of a hopf algebra @xmath0 , of a hopf pairing @xmath133 , and of the category @xmath134 of yetter - drinfeld modules over @xmath0 make sense in any braided category @xmath51 .",

    "a partial dualization datum @xmath139 gives rise to a new hopf algebra @xmath142 in @xmath51 as follows .",
