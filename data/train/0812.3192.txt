    "one of the most challenging problems in strong interaction dynamics is to understand the interactions and composition of hadrons in terms of the fundamental quark and gluon degrees of freedom of the qcd lagrangian . because of the strong - coupling of qcd in the infrared domain",
    ", it has been difficult to find analytic solutions for the wavefunctions of hadrons or to make precise predictions for hadronic properties outside of the perturbative regime .",
    "thus an important theoretical goal is to find an initial approximation to bound - state problems in qcd which is analytically tractable and which can be systematically improved . the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite between string states in anti  de sitter ( ads ) space and conformal field theories in physical space - time , modified for color confinement , has led to a semiclassical model for strongly - coupled qcd which provides analytical insights into its inherently non - perturbative nature , including hadronic spectra , decay constants , and wavefunctions .",
    "as we have recently shown  @xcite , there is a remarkable correspondence between the ads description of hadrons and the hamiltonian formulation of qcd in physical space - time quantized on the light front .",
    "a key feature is `` light - front holography '' which allows one to precisely map the @xmath2 solutions @xmath3 for hadron amplitudes in the fifth dimensional variable @xmath0 to light - front wavefunctions @xmath4 of hadrons in the light - front coordinate @xmath1 in physical space - time  @xcite , thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons in qcd at the amplitude level . for two particles @xmath5 which is conjugate to the invariant mass squared @xmath6 of the pair and also their light - front kinetic energy @xmath7 one can derive this connection by showing that one obtains the identical holographic mapping using the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current and the energy - momentum tensor  @xcite ; this gives an important consistency test and verification of holographic mapping from ads to physical observables defined on the light front .",
    "the mathematical consistency of light - front holography for both the electromagnetic and gravitational  @xcite hadronic transition matrix elements demonstrates that the mapping between the ads holographic variable @xmath0 and the transverse light - front variable @xmath8 which is a function of the multi - dimensional coordinates of the partons in a given light - front fock state @xmath9 at fixed light - front time @xmath10 is a general principle .",
    "our analysis follows from recent developments in light - front qcd  @xcite which have been inspired by the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite between string states in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space and conformal field theories ( cft ) in physical space - time .",
    "conformal symmetry is broken in physical qcd by quantum effects and quark masses .",
    "the application of ads space and conformal methods to qcd can be motivated from the empirical evidence  @xcite and theoretical arguments  @xcite that the qcd coupling @xmath11 has an infrared fixed point at small @xmath12 in particular , a new extraction of the effective strong coupling constant @xmath13 from clas spin structure function data in an extended @xmath14 region using the bjorken sum rule @xmath15  @xcite , indicates the lack of @xmath14 dependence of @xmath16 in the low @xmath14 limit .",
    "one can understand this physically : in a confining theory where gluons have an effective mass  @xcite or the quarks and gluons have maximal wavelength  @xcite , all vacuum polarization corrections to the gluon self - energy decouple at long wavelength .",
    "thus an infrared fixed point appears to be a natural consequence of confinement .",
    "furthermore , if one considers a semiclassical approximation to qcd with massless quarks and without particle creation or absorption , then the resulting @xmath17 function is zero , the coupling is constant , and the approximate theory is scale and conformal invariant  @xcite .",
    "one can then use conformal symmetry as a _ template _ , systematically correcting for its nonzero @xmath17 function as well as higher - twist effects  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we can use the mapping of the group of poincare and conformal generators @xmath18 to the isometries of @xmath19 space . the fact that gluons have maximum wavelengths and hence minimum",
    "momenta provides an explanation for why multiple emission of soft gluons with large couplings does not spoil the appelquist - politzer argument for the narrowness of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; the explanation is that such emission is kinematically forbidden  @xcite .    in this lecture",
    "we review some of the features of the `` hard - wall ''  @xcite and `` soft - wall ''  @xcite ads / qcd models  @xcite which provide an initial approximation to qcd . in our approach",
    "the holographic mapping is carried out in the strongly coupled regime where qcd is almost conformal , but in contrast with the ads / qcd framework described in  @xcite quark and gluon degrees of freedom are explicitly introduced in the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "consequently , the identification of orbital angular momentum of the constituents becomes a key element in the description of the internal structure of hadrons using holographic principles . to this end",
    ", we also will discuss a procedure based on the light - front hamiltonian of qcd  @xcite which in principle allows the model to be systematically improved .",
    "some of the important features of light - front ads / qcd include :    \\(1 ) effective frame - independent single - particle schdinger and dirac equations for meson and baryon wave equations in both @xmath0 and @xmath22 for example , the meson eigenvalue equation is @xmath23\\phi(z ) = { \\cal m}^2\\phi(z).\\ ] ] where the soft - wall potential has the form of a harmonic oscillator @xmath24    \\(2 ) the mass spectra formula for mesons at zero quark mass in the soft - wall model is @xmath25 which agrees with conventional regge phenomenology . as in the nambu string model based on a rotating flux tube ,",
    "the regge slope is the same for both the principal quantum number @xmath26 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath27 .",
    "the ads / qcd correspondence thus builds in a remarkable connection between the string mass @xmath28 in the string theory underlying an effective gravity theory in the fifth dimension with the orbital angular momentum of hadrons in physical space - time .",
    "\\(3 ) the pion is massless at zero quark mass in agreement with general arguments based on chiral symmetry .",
    "\\(4 ) the predicted form factors for the pion and nucleons agree well with experiment .",
    "the nucleon lfwfs have both @xmath29 and @xmath30 wave - components allowing one to compute both the dirac and pauli form factors . in general the ads",
    "/ qcd form factors fall off in momentum transfer squared @xmath31 with a leading power predicted by the dimensional counting rules and the leading twist of the hadron s dominant interpolating operator at short distances .",
    "the short - distance behavior of a hadronic state is characterized by its twist ( dimension minus spin ) @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the sum over the constituent s spin @xmath34 .",
    "twist is also equal to the number of partons @xmath35 if @xmath36 under conformal transformations the interpolating operators transform according to their twist , and consequently the ads isometries map the twist scaling dimensions into the ads modes  @xcite .",
    "light - front holography thus provide a simple semiclassical approximation to qcd which has both constituent counting rule behavior  @xcite at short distances and confinement at large distances  @xcite .",
    "\\(5 ) the timelike form factors of hadrons exhibit poles in the @xmath37 vector meson channels , an analytic feature which arises from the dressed electromagnetic current in ads / qcd  @xcite .",
    "\\(6 ) the form of the nonperturbative pion distribution amplitude @xmath38 obtained from integrating the @xmath39 valence lfwf @xmath40 over @xmath41 , has a quite different @xmath42-behavior than the asymptotic distribution amplitude predicted from the erbl pqcd evolution  @xcite of the pion distribution amplitude .",
    "the ads prediction @xmath43 has a broader distribution than expected from solving the erbl evolution equation in perturbative qcd .",
    "this observation appears to be consistent with the results of the fermilab diffractive dijet experiment  @xcite , the moments obtained from lattice qcd  @xcite and pion form factor data  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important theoretical tools in atomic physics is the schrdinger equation , which describes the quantum - mechanical structure of atomic systems at the amplitude level .",
    "light - front wavefunctions ( lfwfs ) play a similar role in quantum chromodynamics , providing a fundamental description of the structure and internal dynamics of hadrons in terms of their constituent quarks and gluons .",
    "the light - front wavefunctions of bound states in qcd are relativistic generalizations of the schrdinger wavefunctions of atomic physics , but they are determined at fixed light - cone time @xmath44  the `` front form '' introduced by dirac  @xcite  rather than at fixed ordinary time @xmath45 . a remarkable feature of lfwfs is the fact that they are frame independent ; i.e. , the form of the lfwf is independent of the hadron s total momentum @xmath46 and @xmath47    when a flash from a camera illuminates a scene , each object is illuminated along the light - front of the flash ; i.e. , at a given @xmath48 . similarly , when a sample is illuminated by an x - ray source such as the linac coherent light source , each element of the target is struck at a given @xmath49 in contrast , setting the initial condition using conventional instant time @xmath45 requires simultaneous scattering of photons on each constituent .",
    "thus it is natural to set boundary conditions at fixed @xmath48 and then evolve the system using the light - front hamiltonian @xmath50 the invariant hamiltonian @xmath51 then has eigenvalues @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the physical mass .",
    "its eigenfunctions are the light - front eigenstates whose fock state projections define the light - front wavefunctions .",
    "light - front quantization is the ideal framework to describe the structure of hadrons in terms of their quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "the simple structure of the light - front vacuum allows an unambiguous definition of the partonic content of a hadron .",
    "given the lfwfs , one can compute observables such as hadronic form factors and structure functions , as well as the generalized parton distributions and distribution amplitudes which underly hard exclusive reactions . the constituent spin and orbital angular momentum properties of the hadrons",
    "are also encoded in the lfwfs .",
    "a key step in the analysis of an atomic system such as positronium is the introduction of the spherical coordinates @xmath54 which separates the dynamics of coulomb binding from the kinematical effects of the quantized orbital angular momentum @xmath27 .",
    "the essential dynamics of the atom is specified by the radial schrdinger equation whose eigensolutions @xmath55 determine the bound - state wavefunction and eigenspectrum . in this paper , we show that there is an analogous invariant light - front coordinate @xmath1 which allows one to separate the essential dynamics of quark and gluon binding from the kinematical physics of constituent spin and internal orbital angular momentum .",
    "the result is a single - variable light - front schrdinger equation for qcd which determines the eigenspectrum and the light - front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "light - front holography can be derived by observing the correspondence between matrix elements obtained in ads / cft with the corresponding formula using the lf representation  @xcite .",
    "the light - front electromagnetic form factor in impact space  @xcite can be written as a sum of overlap of light - front wave functions of the @xmath56 spectator constituents : @xmath57 the formula is exact if the sum is over all fock states @xmath26 .",
    "for definiteness we shall consider a two - quark @xmath58 valence fock state @xmath59 with charges @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath62 , there are two terms which contribute to the @xmath63-sum in ( [ eq : ffb ] ) . exchanging @xmath64 in the second integral we find ( @xmath65 = 1 ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "notice that by performing an identical calculation for the @xmath69 meson the result is @xmath70 for any value of @xmath63 , as expected from @xmath71-charge conjugation invariance .",
    "we now compare this result with the electromagnetic form - factor in ads space  @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 . using the integral representation of @xmath74 @xmath75 we can write the ads electromagnetic form - factor as @xmath76 comparing with the light - front qcd form factor ( [ eq : piffb ] ) for arbitrary values of @xmath77 @xmath78 where we identify the transverse light - front variable @xmath1 , @xmath79 , with the holographic variable @xmath0 .",
    "matrix elements of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath80 which define the gravitational form factors play an important role in hadron physics .",
    "since one can define @xmath81 for each parton , one can identify the momentum fraction and contribution to the orbital angular momentum of each quark flavor and gluon of a hadron .",
    "for example , the spin - flip form factor @xmath82 , which is the analog of the pauli form factor @xmath83 of a nucleon , provides a measure of the orbital angular momentum carried by each quark and gluon constituent of a hadron at @xmath84 similarly , the spin - conserving form factor @xmath85 , the analog of the dirac form factor @xmath86 , allows one to measure the momentum fractions carried by each constituent .",
    "this is the underlying physics of ji s sum rule  @xcite : @xmath87 $ ] , which has prompted much of the current interest in the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) measured in deeply virtual compton scattering .",
    "measurements of the gdp s are of particular relevance for determining the distribution of partons in the transverse impact plane , and thus could be confronted with ads / qcd predictions which follow from the mapping of ads modes to the transverse impact representation  @xcite .",
    "an important constraint is @xmath88 ; i.e. the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of a hadron vanishes when summed over all the constituents @xmath89 .",
    "this was originally derived from the equivalence principle of gravity  @xcite .",
    "the explicit verification of these relations , fock state by fock state , can be obtained in the light - front quantization of qcd in light - cone gauge  @xcite .",
    "physically @xmath90 corresponds to the fact that the sum of the @xmath26 orbital angular momenta @xmath27 in an @xmath26-parton fock state must vanish since there are only @xmath91 independent orbital angular momenta .",
    "the light - front expression for the helicity - conserving gravitational form factor in impact space is  @xcite @xmath92 which includes the contribution of each struck parton with longitudinal momentum @xmath93 and corresponds to a change of transverse momentum @xmath94 for each of the @xmath95 spectators . for @xmath62 , there are two terms which contribute to the @xmath96-sum in ( [ eq : ab ] ) . exchanging @xmath64 in the second integral we find @xmath97 where @xmath67 .",

    "recently we have presented  @xcite a new perspective on the nature of qcd condensates @xmath198 and @xmath199 , particularly where they have spatial and temporal support .",
    "their spatial support is restricted to the interior of hadrons , since these condensates arise due to the interactions of quarks and gluons which are confined within hadrons .",

    "the change in the ( dynamical ) mass of the light quark in this bound state is somewhat reminiscent of the energy shift of an electron in the lamb shift , in that both are consequences of the fermion being in a bound state rather than propagating freely .",
    "similarly , it is important to use the equations of motion for confined quarks and gluon fields when analyzing current correlators in qcd , not free propagators , as has often been done in traditional analyses of operator products .",

    "the @xmath204 orders of magnitude conflict of qcd with the observed value of the cosmological condensate is thus removed  @xcite . a new perspective on the nature of quark and gluon condensates in quantum chromodynamics is thus obtained :  @xcite the spatial support of qcd condensates is restricted to the interior of hadrons , since they arise due to the interactions of confined quarks and gluons . in the lf theory , the condensate physics is replaced by the dynamics of higher non - valence fock states . in particular , chiral symmetry is broken in a limited domain of size @xmath205 , in analogy to the limited physical extent of superconductor phases .",

    "the wavefunction of a stable eigenstate is real ; thus the static structure functions can not describe diffractive deep inelastic scattering nor the single - spin asymmetries since such phenomena involves the complex phase structure of the @xmath220 amplitude .",

    "it should be emphasized that the shadowing of nuclear structure functions is due to the destructive interference between multi - nucleon amplitudes involving diffractive dis and on - shell intermediate states with a complex phase .",

    "it allows one to project the functional dependence of the wavefunction @xmath3 computed in the ads fifth dimension to the hadronic frame - independent light - front wavefunction @xmath221 in @xmath222 physical space - time .",
    "the variable @xmath223 maps to @xmath224 . to prove this , we have shown that there exists a correspondence between the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current and the energy - momentum tensor of the fundamental hadronic constituents in qcd with the corresponding transition amplitudes describing the interaction of string modes in anti - de sitter space with the external sources which propagate in the ads interior .",
    "the agreement of the results for both electromagnetic and gravitational hadronic transition amplitudes provides an important consistency test and verification of holographic mapping from ads to physical observables defined on the light - front .",
    "the transverse coordinate @xmath1 is closely related to the invariant mass squared of the constituents in the lfwf and its off - shellness in the light - front kinetic energy , and it is thus the natural variable to characterize the hadronic wavefunction .",
    "in fact @xmath1 is the only variable to appear in the light - front schrdinger equations predicted from ads / qcd .",
    "the use of the invariant coordinate @xmath1 in light - front qcd allows the separation of the dynamics of quark and gluon binding from the kinematics of constituent spin and internal orbital angular momentum .",
    "the result is a single - variable lf schrdinger equation which determines the spectrum and lfwfs of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "this lf wave equation serves as a first approximation to qcd and is equivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of spin-@xmath225 modes on ads  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to establish a gauge / gravity correspondence between an effective gravity theory on ads@xmath226 and light front qcd .",
    "the ads / lf equations correspond to the kinetic energy terms of the partons inside a hadron , whereas the interaction terms build confinement . since there are no interactions up to the confining scale in this approximation , there are no anomalous dimensions .",
    "the eigenvalues of these equations for both meson and baryons give a good representation of the observed hadronic spectrum , especially in the case of the soft - wall model . in the hard - wall model",
    "the orbital angular momentum decouples from the hadronic spin @xmath225 and thus the lf excitation spectrum of hadrons depends only on orbital and principal quantum numbers . in the hard - wall model",
    "the dependence is linear : @xmath227 . in the soft - wall model the usual regge behavior",
    "is found @xmath228 .",
    "both models predict the same multiplicity of states for mesons and baryons observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the predicted lfwfs have excellent phenomenological features , including predictions for the electromagnetic form factors and decay constants .",
    "this may explain the experimental success of power - law scaling in hard exclusive reactions where there are no indications of the effects of anomalous dimensions .",
    "nonzero quark masses are naturally incorporated into the ads / lf predictions  @xcite by including them explicitly in the lf kinetic energy @xmath229 . given the nonpertubative lfwfs one can predict many interesting phenomenological quantities such as heavy quark decays , generalized parton distributions and parton structure functions .",
    "we also note the distinction between between static structure functions such as the probability distributions computed from the square of the light - front wavefunctions versus dynamical structure functions which include the effects of rescattering .",
    "we have also shown that the lf hamiltonian formulation of quantum field theory provides a natural formalism to compute hadronization at the amplitude level .",
    "the ads / qcd model is semiclassical , and thus it only predicts the lowest valence fock state structure of the hadron lfwf .",
    "one can systematically improve the holographic approximation by diagonalizing the qcd lf hamiltonian on the ads / qcd basis , or by generalizing the variational and other systematic methods used in chemistry and nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "the action of the non - diagonal terms in the qcd interaction hamiltonian also generates the form of the higher fock state structure of hadronic lfwfs .",
    "in contrast with the original ads / cft correspondence , the large @xmath230 limit is not required to connect light - front qcd to an effective dual gravity approximation .",
