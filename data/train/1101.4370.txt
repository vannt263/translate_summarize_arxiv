    "in this paper , we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the meixner polynomials .",
    "these polynomials have many applications in statistical physics .",
    "for instance , they are used in the study of the shape fluctuations in a certain two dimensional random growth model ; see @xcite and the references therein .    for @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the meixner polynomials are given by @xmath3 they satisfy the discrete orthogonality relation @xmath4 this notation is adopted in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath5 10.24 ) and also in @xcite .",
    "using probabilistic arguments , maejima and van assche @xcite have given an asymptotic formula for @xmath6 when @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a positive integer .",
    "their result is in terms of elementary functions . by using the steepest - descent method for integrals , jin and",
    "wong @xcite have derived two infinite asymptotic expansions for @xmath6 ; one holds uniformly for @xmath9 , and the other holds uniformly for @xmath10 .",
    "both expansions involve the parabolic cylinder function and its derivative .    in view of gauss s",
    "contiguous relations for hypergeometric functions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath5 15.2 ) and the connection formula [ 8 ] @xmath11 we may restrict our study to the case @xmath12 and @xmath2 . fixing @xmath2 and @xmath12 , we intend to investigate the large-@xmath13 behavior of @xmath14 for @xmath0 in the whole complex plane , including neighborhood of the origin and regions extending to infinity .",
    "our approach is based on the steepest - descent method for oscillatory riemann - hilbert problems , first introduced by deift and zhou @xcite for nonlinear partial differential equations , later developed in @xcite for orthogonal polynomials with respect to exponential weights , and further extended in @xcite to a general class of discrete orthogonal polynomials .    a direct application of the method in @xcite would , however , only give local asymptotics .",
    "for instance , in the case of meixner polynomials , one would have to divide the complex plane into at least six regions ( one near the origin , two near the two turning points and three in between , including an unbounded one ) , and give correspondingly six different asymptotic formulas . to reduce the number of these regions",
    ", we shall make some modifications to the method in [ 2,@xmath153 ] .",
    "our approach is motivated by the previous work in [ 4 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 18 ] , and the main idea is to extend , as large as possible , the two regions of validity of the two asymptotic formulas near the two turning points .",
    "there have already been several examples in which we only need two regions with appropriate asymptotic formulas to cover the entire plane ; the hermite polynomial [ 17 ] is one of such examples .",
    "however , for discrete orthogonal polynomials , there might be cuts starting from the finite endpoints of the intervals of orthogonality .",
    "for instance , in the case of krawtchouk polynomials considered in [ 4 ] , there are two cuts @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 where no asymptotic formulas are given . in the present paper , we shall give two asymptotic formulas for the meixner polynomial @xmath18 , one valid inside a rectangle with two vertical boundary lines passimg through @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the other valid outside the rectangle .",
    "both formulas can be extended slightly beyond the boundary of the rectangle , and they are asymptotically equal to each other in the overlapping region . the material in this paper is arranged as follows . in section 2 , we use a standard method to relate the meixner polynomials to a riemann - hilbert problem for a matrix - valued function .",
    "the motivation and details of this standard procedure can be found in @xcite and the reference given there . in section 3 , we introduce some auxiliary functions which will be used in section 4 for the construction of our parametrix . in section 4 , we also prove that this parametrix is asymptotically equal to the solution of the riemann - hilbert problem formulated in section 2 . in section 5 ,",
    "we state our main result and make the remark that our formulas agree with the ones already existing in the literature .",
    "from ( [ meixner ] ) , we note that the leading coefficient of @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the monic meixner polynomials are given by @xmath23 for convenience , in ( 2.1 ) we have suppressed the dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath25 and @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , throughout the paper we shall fix the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
