    "the elastic stress response of living cells and tissues is governed by the viscoelasticity of complex networks of filamentous proteins such as the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix  @xcite .",
    "this property of such biological gels not only makes living cells and tissues stiff enough to maintain shape and transmit forces under mechanical stress , but also provides them the compliance to alter their morphology needed for cell motion and internal reorganization . unlike ordinary polymer gels and other materials with rubber - like elastic properties however , biological gels behave nonlinearly in response to deformation .",
    "one classic feature is strain stiffening , where a moderately increasing deformation leads to a rapid increase in stress within the material .",
    "such is observed in gels of cytoskeletal and extracellular fibers @xcite and in soft human tissues @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of elastic nonlinearity is the so - called negative normal stress .",
    "most solid materials exhibit what is known as the poynting effect @xcite where the response is to expand in a direction normal to an externally applied shear stress .",
    "this effect explains why metal wires increase in length under torsional strain .",
    "by contrast , cross - linked biopolymer gels exhibit the opposite response to shear deformation , which can be understood either in terms of the inherent asymmetry in the extension - compression response of thermal semiflexible polymers or non - affine deformations in athermal fiber networks @xcite .",
    "research on the elastic properties of fiber networks often aimed to elucidate the microscopic origins of viscoelasticity has generated significant progress , making way for models that highlight the importance and interplay of semiflexible filaments , cross - link connectivity , network geometry , and disorder .",
    "an important consideration when modeling the elastic response of biological gels with fiber networks is the inherent instability of the underlying geometry with respect to stretching . whether intracellular or extracellular biopolymer networks",
    "are studied , the constituent fibers usually form either cross - linked or branched architectures  @xcite , corresponding to an average connectivity below the maxwell isostatic criterion for marginal stability of spring networks with only stretching response .",
    "such systems , however , can be stabilized by a variety of additional interactions , such as fiber bending rigidity @xcite , thermal fluctuations @xcite , internal stresses generated by molecular motors @xcite , boundary stresses @xcite , or even strain @xcite .",
    "these stabilizing fields give rise to interesting linear and nonlinear elastic behavior",
    ".    detailed analytical and computational work on the linear elastic response of networked systems reveal two distinct regimes : an affine regime dominated by extension / compression of the fibers and a cross - over to a non - affine one dominated by fiber bending @xcite .",
    "in addition to fiber elasticity , these linear regimes are also found to be dictated by network structure and disorder and can exhibit rich zero - temperature critical behavior , including a cross - over to a mixed regime @xcite .",
    "such linear regimes in turn have important consequences to the nonlinear response where large deformations are involved .",
    "in particular , large stresses applied to a network initially dominated by filament bending would lead to a strong strain - induced stiffening response @xcite , which coincides with the onset of negative normal stress @xcite .",
    "in general , the variety of computational models to understand certain specific aspects of linear or nonlinear network elasticity can either be based on off - lattice @xcite or lattice structures @xcite , which can also be combined with a mean - field approach @xcite .",
    "indeed , much has been done with lattices to understand linear elasticity , in contrast to nonlinear elasticity often studied on random networks .",
    "the advantage of lattice models is the computational efficiency as well as the relative ease with which one can generate increasingly larger network sizes . we intend to study nonlinear elasticity using a lattice based model and compare with results on a random network .",
    "we begin with a detailed description of the disordered phantom network used to study the elastic stress response of passive networks with permanent cross - links @xcite .",
    "this model allows independent control of filament rigidity , network geometry and cross - link connectivity .",
    "we present our results in the nonlinear elastic regime , focusing on shear stiffening and negative normal stress .",
    "finally we conclude with implications when using lattice - based models to understand nonlinear elasticity of stiff fiber networks .",
    "biopolymers can form either cross - linked or branched network structures that have average connectivity somewhere between three - fold ( @xmath0 ) at branch points and four - fold ( @xmath1 ) at cross - links  @xcite . if these nodes interact only via central forces such as tension or compression of springs , the network rigidity vanishes and and the resulting networks are inherently unstable  @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that these sub - isostatic systems can be stabilized by other effects such as the bending of rigid fibers @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we describe a minimal model of a sub - isostatic network in which the the constituent fibers are modeled as an elastic beam whose rigidity is governed by pure enthalpic contributions .",
    "we generate a disordered phantom network  @xcite by arranging fibers into a @xmath2-dimensional space - filling regular lattice of size @xmath3 .",
    "periodic boundaries are imposed to reduce edge effects .",
    "freely - hinged cross - links bind the intersections of fiber segments permanently at the vertices , which are separated by a uniform spacing @xmath4 .",
    "since a full lattice has a fixed connectivity of either @xmath5 ( 2d ) or @xmath6 ( 3d ) , we randomly detach binary cross - links ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) at each vertex . thus far , all fibers span the system size which leads to unphysical stretching contributions to the macroscopic elasticity .",
    "we therefore cut at least one bond on each spanning fiber .",
    "finally , to reduce the average connectivity we _ dilute _ the lattice by cutting random bonds with probability any remaining dangling ends are further removed .",
    "the lattice - based network thus generated is sub - isostatic with average connectivity @xmath7 , average fiber length @xmath8 and average distance between cross - links      when the network is deformed , any point on every fiber undergoes a displacement which induces a local change in length @xmath9 and a local curvature @xmath10 .",

    "these parameters can be absorbed into a _ bending length scale _ @xmath16 .",
    "one can normalize @xmath17 by the geometric length @xmath18 to obtain a dimensionless fiber rigidity @xmath19 , or @xmath20    in our network of straight fibers with discrete segments , a midpoint node is introduced on every segment to capture at least the first bending mode over the smallest length scale @xmath18 .",

    "we derive @xmath74 using only geometric arguments and demonstrate that for bend - dominated networks , our expression is in excellent agreement with the simulations . in a bend dominated network , with increasing strain , the bend amplitude increases . the increase in bend amplitude",
    "is coupled to the longitudinal contraction of the filament along its backbone .",
    "when these two displacements , namely the contraction along the backbone and the bend amplitude become comparable , nonlinear stiffening sets in such that any further strain induces stretching of filaments in addition to bending .",
    "we also demonstrate that the above geometric argument immediately leads to normal stress becoming comparable to the shear stress at @xmath74 .",
    "obtaining @xmath74 as the strain at which normal and shear stress become equal provides an unambiguous definition of the onset of stiffening .",
    "our derivation of @xmath74 is purely geometrical and can be considered to hold only in the limit of vanishing bending rigidity .",
    "we derive an expression for the stiffening strain for finite bending rigidity and show that it can accurately describe the onset of stiffening for even those networks which are not bend - dominated in the linear regime .",
    "the onset of stiffening strain , as expected , reduces to @xmath74 in the limit of vanishing bending rigidity . experimental determination of @xmath74",
    "is based on an arbitrary criterion such as the strain at which the differential modulus becomes 3 times the linear modulus  @xcite .",
    "however , the advantage of defining @xmath74 based on stress could be nullified in experiments due to normal stress .",
    "any prestress in the network would offset the normal stresses generated in the network under strain .",
    "in the nonlinear regime , for @xmath201 both bending and stretching energies increase faster than a quadratic dependence on the strain which manifests itself in a rapid increase in the modulus with strain . at a certain strain @xmath202 , the two energies become comparable to each other . the nonlinear mechanics in the range @xmath203",
    "are controlled by normal stress in the network .",
    "we show that the elastic modulus increases in proportion to the normal stress .",
    "the observation that the modulus scales linearly with the normal stress is reminiscent of the stabilization of floppy networks under normal stress .",
    "fiber networks , in absence of bending interactions , are floppy and can be stabilized by several fields  @xcite including normal stress .",
    "the normal stress can be generated internally by molecular motors  @xcite or externally by subjecting network to a global deformation  @xcite .",
    "independent of the origin of the normal stress , the linear modulus of an initially unstable network ( in absence of normal stress ) scales linearly with the normal stress . here",
    ", we generalize the idea of stabilization by normal stress to an initially stable network ( finite bending interactions ) in the nonlinear regime , where the normal stress become the dominant stress in the network and control the stiffening .",
    "we present a scaling argument which yields a linear relation between the nonlinear modulus and the normal stress in the stiffening regime .",
    "the modulus and the normal stress are related via the network susceptibility to the latter .",
    "we show that the susceptibility is fully governed by the underlying geometry of the network .",
    "in fact , the susceptibility scales as the inverse @xmath74 . to further test the role of normal stress in stiffening regime",
    ", we consider a scenario in which normal stress is always relaxed to zero for any imposed shear strain by allowing the shear boundaries to retract along the normal direction .",
    "we observe that there is no stiffening in the absence of normal stress .",
    "the modulus remains clamped to the linear modulus in the regime @xmath204 .",
    "expriments on collagen networks have shown that over a wide range of collagen concentration , @xmath53 scales linearly with the shear stress @xmath69",
    "we show that such dependence of @xmath53 on the shear stress follows naturally from our hypothesis of normal stress induced stiffening . over a significant range of bending rigidity which",
    "is directly related to protein concentration  @xcite , we find that the shear stress scales approximately linearly with the normal stress",
    ". it follows that stiffening can be understood in terms of normal stresses .    in summary , we study the mechanics of athermal fiber networks .",

    "<S> athermal models of disordered fibrous networks are highly useful for studying the mechanics of elastic networks composed of stiff biopolymers . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying network architecture is a key aspect that can affect the elastic properties of these systems , which include rich linear and nonlinear elasticity . </S>",
    "<S> existing computational approaches have focused on both lattice - based and off - lattice networks obtained from the random placement of rods . </S>",
    "<S> it is not obvious , a priori , whether the two architectures have fundamentally similar or different mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> if they are different , it is not clear which of these represents a better model for biological networks . here , we show that both approaches are essentially equivalent for the same network connectivity , provided the networks are sub - isostatic with respect to central force interactions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for a given sub - isostatic connectivity , we even find that lattice - based networks in both 2d and 3d exhibit nearly identical nonlinear elastic response . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a description of the linear mechanics for both architectures in terms of a scaling function . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the nonlinear regime is dominated by fiber bending and that stiffening originates from the stabilization of sub - isostatic networks by stress . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a generalized relation for this regime in terms of the self - generated normal stresses that develop under deformation . </S>",
    "<S> different network architectures have different susceptibilities to the normal stress , but essentially exhibit the same nonlinear mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> such stiffening mechanism has been shown to successfully capture the nonlinear mechanics of collagen networks . </S>"
