    "a staged program of neutrino oscillation experiments is forseen using a new beam line facility , the `` neutrinos at the main injector '' ( numi ) @xcite , at the fermi national accelerator laboratory .",
    "the first experiment , minos @xcite , will perform definitive spectrum measurements which demonstrate the effect of @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "the experiment has run since early 2005 and published a first result @xcite based upon @xmath3  protons - on - target , approximately 1/10@xmath4 the eventual exposure of the experiment .",
    "the second , no@xmath1a @xcite , has been approved to explore the phenomenon of cp violation in the transition @xmath2 and possibly resolve the mass heirarchy of neutrinos .",
    "a third , miner@xmath1a @xcite , is an experiment 1 km from the numi target to perform neutrino cross section measurements essential for long - baseline neutrino oscillation searches .",
    "numi is a tertiary beam resulting from the decays of pion and kaon secondaries produced in the numi target .",
    "protons of 120 gev are fast - extracted ( spill duration @xmath5sec ) from the main injector ( mi ) accelerator and bent downward by 58  mrad toward soudan , mn ( see figure  [ fig : numi ] ) .",
    "the beam line is designed to accept @xmath6  protons - per - pulse  ( ppp ) .",
    "the beam line can be flexibly configured to achieve a variety of neutrino energies @xcite . to date",
    ", the average ( peak ) beam power has been 230  kw ( 310  kw ) , and a three - phase plan has been approved to upgrade the accelerator complex and numi line to increase this intensity to 430  kw by 2009 , then 700  kw by 2012 , then 1200  kw by 2013 .",
    "the mi is fed multiple batches from the 8  gev booster accelerator .",
    "the booster can deliver @xmath7/batch . during normal operations ,",
    "the mi beam is shared : 2 of 7 accelerated booster batches are extracted to make antiprotons for the tevatron collider , while the remaining 5 are extracted to the numi target .",
    "the first phase of the intensity upgrades takes advantage of the fast ( 67  ms ) cycle time to the booster to inject as many as 11 batches of protons into the mi .",
    "pairs of batches will be coalesced by a process of `` slip - stacking '' @xcite into 6 double - batches around the mi circumference , and this beam accelerated to 120  gev .",
    "already , minos has received a 20% increase in beam power by slip - stacking of 2 batches and accelerating these along with 5 other single batches , and tests of 11-batch stacking have achieved as much as 3@xmath8  ppp , which will improve as the coalescing and capture process is better understood .",
    "this phase should be fully - implemented in 2007 and achieve 430  kw .",
    "the second phase will use the 8  gev recycler ring in the mi tunnel as a pre - injector .",
    "the recycler , which has the same circumference as the mi , will be used to pre - load and slip - stack 11 booster batches , then perform a fast transfer to the mi for acceleration .",
    "this reduces the mi cycle time from 2.2  sec . to 1.3  sec . , increasing the beam power to numi to 700  kw ( see table  [ table : power ] ) .",
    "this phase is to be implemented at the end - of - tevatron shutdown in 2009 , and has been approved by the laboratory .",
    "the third phase , which is still in its conceptual stages , calls for use of the accumulator , currently utilized for antiproton beam accumulation , as a proton beam accumulator which will permit 3 booster batches to be coalesced in one booster - equivalent circumference .",
    "six such accumulator batches can be injected into the recycler , then the main injector .",
    "the plan calls for new injection and extraction lines to be built for the accumulator ( see figure  [ fig : accum ] ) .",
    "as shown in table  [ table : power ] , the anticipated beam power to numi is then 1.2  mw .",
    "phases ii and iii require upgrades to the numi line .",
    "these include the substitution of a graphite target with alternative water cooling schemes capable of withstanding the higher beam power and also additional cooling in the target station , decay tunnel , and beam stop .",
    "the new target design is facilitated by the fact that in the future the numi beam will operate at higher on - axis neutrino energy ( which will obtain an ideal 1.8  gev off - axis for the no@xmath1a experiment , see below ) and the target will no longer be cantilevered inside the first focusing horn .

    "minos is a two - detector experiment , with a 980  ton detector located 1  km from the numi target on site at fnal ( see figure  [ fig : numi ] ) to measure the neutrio flux directly , and a second , 5400  ton detector located in the soudan mine in minnesota , at a distance 735  km . the spectrum of neutrinos arriving in the far detector is studied to investigate whether neutrinos oscillate , decay , or otherwise disappear in flight .",

    "the results of the first 1.2@xmath10  pot are shown in figure  [ fig : minos - result ] . following commissioning of the beam line , the experiment acquired several data samples at different neutrino energies to study the beam spectrum and neutrino interactions in the near detector .",
    "having thus tested the calculated spectrum of the neutrino flux , the monte carlo could be better trusted to describe any differences in the neutrino energy spectra in the near and far detectors .",
    "the energy spectrum observed in the near detector was multiplied by an extrapolation factor @xcite which corrects the near spectrum to the expected spectrum ( in the absence of oscillations ) at the far detector .",
    "a deficit of @xmath0 s with @xmath11  gev of @xmath12 is observed .",
    "if interpreted as neutrino oscillations , the data indicate    @xmath13    with the mixing angle consistent with maximal mixing : @xmath14 .",

    "it features 196 alternating planes of @xmath20 and @xmath21 strips , with each strip consisting of @xmath22 triangular solid extruded scintillator read out into a multi - anode pmt via scintillating fiber .",
    "the finer pitch , overlapping triangular strips gives excellent position resolution to reconstruct final states in neutrino - nucleus interactions .",
    "a coarse outer calorimeter is used for shower containment , and muon momentum analysis is performed in the downstream minos near detector .",
    "the ability of the detector to perform detailed analyses of neutrino final states may be seen in figure  [ fig : minerva - events ] .    a detector : ( left ) quasielastic scattering , ( right ) resonant production , with the @xmath23 visible in the detector . , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "-0.5 cm    uncertainties in neutrino cross sections are substantial at low energy . of particular note are the large uncertainties in the minos oscillation result due to such cross section uncertainties @xcite : pion reabsorption by the struck nucleus can alter the apparent final state multiplicity and visible energy .",

    "this arises due to the matter effect , and results in an asymmetry even in the absence of cp violation .",
    "this fact makes the no@xmath1a experiment quite complementary to the jparc t2k experiment , which will operate at lower @xmath26 and shorter baseline : jparc will measure the transition probability for @xmath2 , which measures the mixing angle @xmath28 in the neutrino mixing matrix , and the no@xmath1a experiment could study both the @xmath1 and @xmath29 process to understand the mass heirarchy of the neutrino states , and possibly also measure the cp phase @xmath18 .",

    "the challenge for the experiment will be the reduction of neutral current @xmath0 interactions , which can mimic the showers of charged - current @xmath24 events .    to reduce neutral current backgrounds , the no@xmath1a detector is a fine - grained totally - active segmented calorimeter , consisting of alternating horizontally- and vertically - oriented planes of scintillator strips , 15.7  m in length and 6  cm in depth by 3.9  cm transverse width .",
    "the scintillator strips are made using extruded pvc shells filled with liquid scintillator .",
    "the two ends of a looped scintillating fiber which runs the 15.7  m length of the strip brings the light out to an apd .",
    "the light output for a minimum ionizing particle is 20  photo - electrons , to be compared with 2  photo - electrons noise from the apd .",
    "the detector will have 1654 planes of 384 strips , for a total mass of 25  kton .",
    "figure  [ fig : nova - sensitivity ] shows the capability of the no@xmath1a experiment to observe the @xmath2 transition with 3@xmath17 significance after an exposure of @xmath30  pot ( equivalent to 7  years of phase - iii running ) .",
    "the curves are calculated using values derived from a full simulation of neutrino interactions in the no@xmath1a detector , namely 23% efficiency for identifying a @xmath24 charged current interaction , as well as a rejection factor of 7@xmath31 ( 1.3@xmath32 ) for charged current ( neutral current ) @xmath0 s .",
    "running the numi beam in both @xmath1 and @xmath29 mode makes the discovery potential of the experiment less dependent upon the cp phase and mass heirarchy .",
    "two longer - term design studies are underway in the u.s",
    ". the first would consider the feasibility of building a high - resolution liquid argon detector of order 50  kton to study @xmath2 transitions in the numi beam @xcite .",
    "the design would build upon previous lar experience , housing the detector in a massive cryogenic system as is used for liquid natural gas .",
    "the second is a bnl - fnal study @xcite to send a neutrino beam to dusel .",
    "if the beam were initiated at fnal , the main injector complex could serve as its source , but a new neutrino line would have to be built which points in the direction of dusel . the proposal is for an on - axis wide - band neutrino beam . at the fnal site , such a beam line could be at most 400  m in length .",
    "neutrino physics in the u.s . has enjoyed a renaissance with the commissioning of the numi line at fnal .",
