    "the average length of matter traversed by a parton depends on its azimuth  @xcite , which results in azimuthally dependent two - particle correlations  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we give for the first time a unified presentation of these phenomena , which have so far been discussed separately . in all cases , analyzing azimuthally dependent correlations involves two distinct operations : 1 ) measuring the distribution of a pair of particles with respect to the reaction plane ; 2 ) isolating the `` true '' correlation from the uncorrelated part .",

    "in particular , it will clearly appear that any method used to measure the single - particle anisotropic flow can also be used to analyze azimuthally sensitive correlations , modulo minor modifications . in that view , we recall in appendix  [ s : appendix ] the main features of existing methods for analyzing one - particle flow , and we introduce the changes necessary to measure pair flow . while existing methods all require to estimate the reaction plane on an event - by - event basis  @xcite ( see for instance refs .",

    "@xcite and to resolve an inconsistency of present analyses : on the one hand , one studies a correlation ( between decay products , due to quantum statistics , from jet fragmentation ) which is essentially a `` nonflow '' correlation ; on the other hand , one uses the event - plane method which relies on the assumption that all correlations between particles are due to flow  @xcite .    the second operation is discussed in sec .",

    "the fourier coefficients @xmath16 have by now become familiar in the study of anisotropic flow in ( ultra)relativistic heavy - ion collisions . nevertheless , it is instructive to recall why they are the proper tools to parameterize azimuthal anisotropies .",
    "the key feature is that even though the reaction plane @xmath6 is unknown on an event - by - event basis , the first fourier coefficients @xmath16 can be accurately reconstructed from a statistical analysis of azimuthal correlations between outgoing particles ( see appendix  [ s : methods1 ] for a review of the methods for analyzing single - particle flow ) .",

    "[ fig : angles ] ]    the above definitions can readily be generalized to the distribution of particle _ pairs _ with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "a pair of particles of given species is characterized by 6 kinematic variables @xmath22 .",
    "it is convenient to combine @xmath23 and @xmath18 into the relative angle @xmath24 ( or any similar observable that does not depend on the overall orientation of the pair in the transverse plane , as e.g. the invariant mass ) and a `` pair angle '' @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",

    "checking that measured values of the coefficients possess these properties then provides a way to evaluate the errors affecting the measurement .    in experimental analyses ,",

    "let us emphasize that the new characterization of azimuthally - sensitive two - particle correlations which we propose , with pair - flow fourier coefficients , represents in our view an improvement over previous parameterizations , in the same way as @xmath16 is an improvement over older observables for anisotropic flow .",
    "the reason is simply that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are model - independent and detector - independent observables .",
    "subtracting the `` trivial '' uncorrelated part in order to isolate the `` true '' correlation is far from trivial . in this section",
    ", we discuss this issue in as simple and general a way as possible . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we start with the case when there is no anisotropic flow . in sec .  [ s : correlationa ] , we explain why the subtraction always involves some degree of arbitrariness , most often in the form of an arbitrary constant .",
    "although this is to some degree well - known , at least to those who actually perform correlation analyses , we think it is worth recalling , since the literature on the subject is rather confusing . in sec .",
    "[ s : correlationb ] , we recall the various ways of normalizing the correlation , depending on the observable under study .    in practice , however , anisotropic flow is most often present , and makes the background subtraction more difficult in heavy ion collisions than in elementary collisions .",
    "note that this applies to all correlation analyses , not only to the azimuthally - dependent ones : the correlation of single particles with the reaction plane induces a correlation between them , which must be always subtracted , at least in principle , in order to isolate other effects ( see for instance @xcite ) . in sec .",
    "[ s : correlationc ] , we explain how this can be done , and show that this subtraction implies further approximations .      in a given event ,",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the numbers of particles in two phase - space bins , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . to simplify the discussion , we assume that the two bins are separated .",
    "if they overlap , one need only replace @xmath54 by the number of pairs in what follows .",
    "the simplest definition of the correlation between the two bins is @xmath55 where angular brackets mean an average over many events . , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the one- and two - particle inclusive cross - sections , divided by the total inelastic nucleus - nucleus cross - section . ]",
    "such a definition is not satisfactory in practice because the sample of events used in the analysis always contains events with different centralities : in particular , the total multiplicity may have sizeable fluctuations within the sample of events considered , and these fluctuations alone induce a correlation between any two phase - space bins .",
    "this correlation is of a rather trivial nature , but it may well overwhelm the interesting ones  @xcite . a simple way out of this problem would be to normalize the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ defcorr1 ] ) by the total number of pairs of correlated and uncorrelated particles , respectively , that is , to define instead the correlation as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of particles in a large enough phase - space bin ( typically , the total number of charged pions seen in the detector for interferometry analyses ) .",
    "this definition is also unsatisfactory for two reasons : first , it obviously introduces some degree of arbitrariness in the definition of the correlation , depending on the choice of the phase space for @xmath59 ; second , part of the fluctuations in @xmath59 may be meaningful for the correlation analysis , as in the case of bose  einstein correlations  @xcite , so that there is no point in subtracting them .    in actual analyses ,",
    "the correlation is rather defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is some free coefficient .",
    "this coefficient is kept constant throughout the correlation analysis ( which typically involves varying the invariant mass , the relative momentum , or the relative azimuth between the two particles ) .",
    "it is then fitted in such a way that the correlation @xmath62 vanishes when it is expected to : at large relative momentum in hbt analyses  @xcite , in some range of @xmath20 in correlations between high-@xmath1 particles  @xcite . in addition , as mentioned above , the background subtraction is often complicated by the existence of anisotropic flow , as we shall discuss in sec .",
    "[ s : correlationc ] .",
    "there are essentially three ways of normalizing yields of particle pairs in azimuthally - independent analyses , depending on the observable under study .    1 .",
    "one simply computes the average number of pairs per event , @xmath63 .",
    "for instance , in order to measure @xmath0 production , one plots the number of @xmath64 pairs per event as a function of the invariant mass @xmath65 of the pair .",
    "the number of pairs in the peak around the @xmath0 mass gives the yield of @xmath0 baryons , modulo acceptance corrections .",
    "2 .   one divides the number of pairs @xmath63 by the number of uncorrelated pairs , @xmath66 .",
    "this is the standard observable for bose ",
    "einstein correlations , where the ratio varies ideally between 2 and 1 as the relative momentum of the pair increases .",
    "3 .   the third , intermediate choice is to divide the number of pairs @xmath63 by the number of `` trigger particles '' @xmath67  @xcite . after subtraction of the uncorrelated part @xmath68 ,",
    "one thus obtains the mean number of particles @xmath51 correlated with a trigger particle , which is independent of the system size ( i.e. , the same for a nucleus - nucleus and for a proton - proton collision ) if there is no final - state interaction .",
    "when the particles in the pair are individually correlated with the reaction plane @xmath6 , this induces a trivial correlation between them , which must also be subtracted .",
    "this subtraction is easy in principle : one simply repeats the operations of secs .",
    "[ s : correlationa ] and [ s : correlationb ] for a fixed orientation of the reaction plane @xmath6 .",
    "then , the following substitutions hold @xmath69 in these equations , @xmath57 , @xmath70 and @xmath56 denote quantities averaged over @xmath6 ; @xmath71 is the distribution of the pair angle , defined in eq .",
    "( [ 2p - dist2 ] ) , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 denote the single - particle azimuthal distributions of each particle , defined as in eq .",
    "( [ 1p - dist2 ] ) .",
    "once the azimuthal distributions of pairs and single particles with respect to the _ true _ reaction plane have been properly reconstructed , extracting the correlation , and its azimuthal dependence , is straightforward .",
    "strictly speaking , however , the one- and two - particle probabilities @xmath9 and @xmath71 at a specific azimuth relative to the reaction plane can not be reconstructed . as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ s : definitions ] , only the first few fourier coefficients @xmath16 or @xmath37 can be reconstructed , due to larger absolute uncertainties on higher - order coefficients . on the other hand ,",
    "the fourier coefficients of a smooth function of @xmath74 are expected to decrease quickly as the order increases ( this expectation is supported by recent experimental single - particle flow data @xcite ) , so that one can reasonably truncate the series , keeping only the measured coefficients . this truncation is always required in order to estimate the correlation from anisotropic flow  @xcite . at rhic , for instance , the error on the azimuthal distribution at midrapidity is likely to be dominated by the error on the fourth harmonic @xmath75 , and one can take @xmath76 as the error on @xmath9 .",
    "we shall now discuss specific applications , with emphasis on the details of the experimental procedure .",
    "let us begin with the measurement of the anisotropic flow of particles that are seen through their decay products , such as @xmath77  @xcite , @xmath78 , @xmath79  @xcite , @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "we shall illustrate the recipe by discussing the flow of @xmath0 baryons .    for each event ,",
    "one sorts @xmath81 pairs into bins of invariant masses @xmath65 .",
    "the first step is then to analyze the total @xmath0 yield : following the standard procedure , one counts the number of pairs in each invariant - mass bin , irrespective of the pair azimuth ; let @xmath82 denote this number .",
    "one then separates this distribution into an uncorrelated part [ the background @xmath83 and a correlated part [ the peak @xmath84 , centered around the expected @xmath0 mass ] : @xmath85 the integral of the correlated part @xmath84 over @xmath65 is the @xmath0 yield .    in most cases ,",
    "the peak is well above the background : to perform the above decomposition , one need not go through the whole procedure of the previous section : instead , one simply assumes that the background @xmath86 is a smooth function of @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "please note that the anisotropic flow of @xmath87 and @xmath88 correlates their azimuthal angles , and therefore distorts the background .",
    "however , the distorted background remains smooth , so that this effect need not be taken into account .",
    "next , one defines the azimuthal angle of the pair , @xmath19 , as the azimuthal angle of the total transverse momentum @xmath30 , and one analyzes the pair flow coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath90 in each bin .",
    "one then performs a decomposition similar to eq .",

    "this identity can be used in order to check the accuracy of the experimental procedure , as in the case of single - particle flow  @xcite .",
    "if the background consists of uncorrelated particles , one also has @xmath95 .    in most analyses",

    "( [ background ] ) and ( [ backgroundflow ] ) .",
    "when the peak / background ratio is low , finally , mixed events can be used to define the background  @xcite .",
    "however , the above - mentioned distortion of the background due to anisotropic flow must then be taken into account , as we shall see in more detail in sec .",
    "[ s : hbt ] .",
    "azimuthally dependent bose ",
    "einstein ( or , more generally , short - range ) correlations are analyzed in two steps .",
    "the first step is to perform a fourier expansion of the pair yield with respect to the reaction plane , for each relative momentum @xmath98  @xcite . as explained in sec .",
    "[ s : definitions ] , any method of flow analysis can be used to extract the fourier coefficients @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "even with the event - plane method , no binning in @xmath96 is required , in contrast to present analyses  @xcite . once the coefficients are known , one easily builds the distribution of pairs relative to the reaction plane ( up to truncation issue mentioned in sec .",

    "[ s : correlationb ] . for a fixed orientation of the reaction plane @xmath6 ,",
    "this number depends on @xmath6 ( see sec .  [",

    "the @xmath6-dependent part , however , involves the ( first ) flow coefficients @xmath16 of both particles in the pair .    to avoid this complication ,",
    "the procedure suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite is to used mixed events with _ aligned event planes_. this procedure , however , is only approximate , because one mixes events with different _ reaction _ planes , although the estimated planes are the same . to be specific ,",

    "typical values of the correction factors for the star experiment at rhic are @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "besides the systematic uncertainty we just discussed , the price to pay for aligned mixed events is that one must essentially perform the whole correlation analysis for fixed values of both the pair angle @xmath19 _ and _ the estimated reaction plane @xmath97 .",
    "we suggest instead the following method :    1 .",

    "( [ subst ] ) , build the azimuthal dependence of the correlation function .",
    "one then eventually extracts azimuthally - dependent hbt radii using standard techniques ( in particular , including correction for coulomb effects ) which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "two - particle azimuthal correlations at large transverse momentum are under intense investigation in ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions , since it has been realized that they yield direct evidence for hard scattering  @xcite . in that case , one correlates a high-@xmath1 particle , the `` trigger '' particle , hereafter labeled 1 , with a lower-@xmath1 particle , hereafter labeled 2 . we assume for simplicity that particles 1 and 2 belong to separate @xmath1 intervals .",

    "@xcite : these authors show how to analyze correlations in- and out of an event plane , which is not exactly the reaction plane . since the event - plane resolution is a detector - dependent quantity , this prevents quantitative comparisons between different experiments .",

    "the long arrows represent the momenta of trigger particles , while the shorter arrows represent the momenta of associated particles .",

    "[ fig : jetquenching ] ]    the standard interpretation of the modification of the correlation function in nucleus - nucleus collisions , compared to proton - proton collisions  @xcite , is that the associated parton loses energy on its way through nuclear matter .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then for a given @xmath20 the number of pairs per trigger particle depends only on the path followed by the associated particle .",
    "symmetry with respect to the reaction plane implies that it is unchanged if @xmath121 is changed into its opposite . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetquenching ] , this symmetry is by no means trivial since the path followed by the trigger particle is now different .",
    "this gives us , for arbitrary @xmath121 and @xmath20 , the prediction @xmath122 if the only nonvanishing fourier harmonic in the single - particle and pair azimuthal distributions is @xmath103 , a simple calculation shows that the previous identity is equivalent to @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the elliptic flow for the trigger particle , and the pair - flow coefficients @xmath125 and @xmath126 have been defined in sec .",

    "these observables , namely the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution ( [ 2p - dist2 ] ) of the pair - angle @xmath19 that characterizes ( together with the relative azimuth ) particle pairs , generalize in a natural way the fourier coefficients @xmath16 for single - particle anisotropic flow . as the latter , the pair - flow coefficients can easily be measured in experiments , using any `` usual '' method of flow analysis ( modulo minor modifications for the measurement of the sine terms , @xmath49 ) : event - plane , two - particle correlations , cumulants , lee - yang zeroes can equally be applied .",
    "we however recommend the last two , when possible , in order to disentangle flow from non - flow effects .",
    "a main point of this paper is that these observables should replace , in future analyses , quantities that are defined for a given azimuth relative to the event plane .",
    "much in the same way , the fourier coefficients @xmath16 have now replaced earlier observables such as the `` flow angle '' , the `` squeeze - out ratio '' in most , if not all analyses of single - particle flow .",
    "the reason is that the event plane is not exactly the reaction plane , and the dispersion varies from one experiment to the other .",
    "therefore , observables defined with respect to an event plane only yield a qualitative information .",
    "the @xmath37 , on the other hand , allow studies of azimuthally - sensitive correlations to enter the quantitative era .",
    "in a second part , we have briefly shown how to relate our observables to physical quantities of interest in three different cases : anisotropic flow of decaying particles , interferometry , and azimuthal correlations of high - momentum particles .",
    "it is important to stress that , unlike the measurement of the pair - flow coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 , this second step does depend on the underlying physical picture .",

    "a striking difference with usual studies of anisotropic flow is the general occurrence of sine terms in the fourier series expansion .",
    "the relevance of such sine terms was already discussed in the context of single - particle flow @xcite and azimuthally sensitive hbt  @xcite . here ,",
    "we have shown for the first time that in the case of correlations between high-@xmath1 particles , jet quenching would result in a specific value for the sine term , given by eq .",
    "( [ predictionsinus ] ) .",
    "azimuthally - sensitive correlations are among the subtlest analyses in our field , and have already given valuable insight on the physics of high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "we hope that the observables and methods introduced in this paper will help to improve future analyses .",
    "thanks to the high statistics now available at rhic , or that one can anticipate at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , new measurements will become possible , for instance the azimuthal dependence of non - identical - particle interferometry or the anisotropic flow of various `` new '' particle types , while probing new regions of phase space .    we thank javier castillo , kirill filimonov , franois gelis , roy lacey , mike lisa , paul sorensen and raju venugopalan for enlightening discussions , and grzegorz stefanek for useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "as stated in sec .  [ s : definitions ] , the measurement of the pair - flow coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 involves the same methods of analysis as for single - particle flow coefficients @xmath16 ( modulo a small modification when measuring @xmath49 ) .",
    "this prompts us to recall briefly the various methods that have been proposed in the literature , indicating the modification necessary to measure the sine coefficient .",
    "the most employed method of flow analysis at ( ultra)relativistic energies is the event - plane method  @xcite , which relies on the event - by - event determination of an estimate of the reaction plane , the so - called `` event plane . ''",
    "once the latter has been estimated ( and various procedures to correct for acceptance issues have been performed ) , one correlates its azimuth with that of each outgoing particle , assuming that _ all _ correlations between the event plane and a given particle ( that is , actually , all two - particle correlations ) are due to flow",
    ". eventually one must correct for the event - plane dispersion ( computed with the help of `` subevents '' ) on a statistical basis : @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath97 , and @xmath6 respectively denote the azimuths of the particle under study , the event plane , and the real reaction plane , while the denominator measures the event - plane dispersion .    beside this first method",
    ", it has long been known that anisotropic flow can be analyzed with two - particle azimuthal correlations  @xcite , without having to estimate the reaction plane in each event .",
    "the procedure consists in building a two - particle correlator , similar to that employed in interferometry studies  @xcite , by forming the ratio of the number of `` real '' pairs ( of particles in a same event ) with relative angle @xmath20 over the number of `` background '' pairs ( mixing particles from different events ) with @xmath20 : @xmath129 as usual , dividing by `` mixed events '' automatically corrects for acceptance anisotropies , so that one can even work with a detector having only limited azimuthal coverage  @xcite , while the event - plane method requires an almost perfect azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the key point in constructing @xmath130 is that its fourier coefficients , which can be deduced by fitting the function , are precisely @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "letting first both particles in the pair run over the whole phase space covered by the detector , one obtains an estimate of `` integrated flow '' , @xmath16 , corresponding to some ( detector - dependent ) average of the coefficient . restricting then one , and only one , of the particles in the pair",
    "( whose azimuth will be denoted by @xmath128 ) to some definite particle type , transverse momentum @xmath1 and rapidity @xmath3 , while letting the other ( azimuth @xmath4 ) be any particle in the event , one constructs a correlator whose fourier coefficients are    @xmath133    the second identity reflects the evenness of @xmath134 ( when parity is conserved ) , while the first yields the `` differential flow '' @xmath135 .",
    "please note that since only one particle per pair belongs to a small phase space bin while it is correlated to all other particles in the event , it follows that statistical errors are the same as with the event - plane method . finally , the bias from `` nonflow '' effects  @xcite is of the same order of magnitude within both event - plane and two - particle correlation methods , but it is easier to subtract , when it is possible , in the latter , as exemplified in the case of unwanted correlations due to global momentum conservation in ref .  @xcite .    as already stated , the main limitation of both the event - plane and the two - particle methods is their relying on the assumption that all azimuthal correlations between particles result from their correlation with the reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "in other words , they neglect nonflow correlations , whose magnitude is known to be large at ultrarelativistic energies  @xcite .",
    "one may try to subtract part of the nonflow effects by performing cuts in phase space , correlating together only particles that are widely separated ( which certainly accounts for short - range correlations ) , but this results in larger statistical errors , while not removing entirely all unwanted effects . the only systematic way to remedy the problem of nonflow correlations in the flow analysis is to apply improved methods of analysis , based on multiparticle correlations  @xcite , which have been implemented at the cern super proton synchrotron  @xcite and at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the essence of these methods is that the relative magnitude of nonflow effects decreases , while that of collective anisotropic flow grows , when one considers the cumulants of correlations between an increasing number of particles .",
    "measuring cumulants of four- , six - particle correlations , one thus minimizes the systematic error due to nonflow effects , the ultimate case being the use of lee  yang zeroes  @xcite , equivalent to `` infinite - order cumulants , '' which isolate _ collective _ behaviors in the system , i.e. , flow effects .",
    "the price to pay is an increase in statistical uncertainties , but the latter is moderate at rhic and lhc energies , especially if one uses all detected particles in the analysis .    in practical analyses ,",
    "these improved methods necessitate the computation of a generating function of multiparticle correlations , @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a complex variable ( see eq .",
    "( 5 ) in ref .  @xcite or eqs .",
    "( 3),(5 ) in ref .",
    "one then derives estimates of integrated flow : in the cumulant approach , by extracting the successive derivatives of @xmath138 at @xmath139 and identifying them with the corresponding derivatives of @xmath140  @xcite ; when using lee  yang zeroes , simply by looking for the location of the first zero of @xmath136 in the complex plane ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "once estimates of integrated flow have been obtained , they are used to compute values of differential flow @xmath135 for particles in a small @xmath141 bin , whose azimuthal angle we shall denote by @xmath128 .",
    "this is done by correlating @xmath128 to the generating function ( see eq .  ( 26 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite or eq .",
    "( 9 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      any of the methods recalled in the previous section can also be employed to measure the anisotropic flow of pairs as well , modulo small modifications .",
    "whatever the method , the first step is strictly the same , namely the construction of the event plane ( and the computation of its statistical dispersion ) in the event - plane method , or the measurement of estimates of integrated flow in the two - particle and multiparticle methods .",
    "we shall now describe the changes that must be made to the measurement of differential single - particle flow in order to analyze the coefficients @xmath48 , @xmath49 . in short ,",
    "the first necessary modification is the obvious replacement of @xmath128 ( the azimuth of `` differential '' particles ) by the pair angle @xmath19 ; then no further change is needed to obtain the cosine coefficient @xmath48 , whose measurement strictly parallels that of @xmath135 , while for @xmath49 one should replace the `` @xmath142 '' term that is correlated to either the event plane or the other particles or a generating function with a `` @xmath143 '' term .",
    "let us be more explicit :    * in the event - plane method , the pair - flow fourier coefficients are given by the averages + @xmath144 + where @xmath97 is the event - plane azimuthal angle and the averages run over pairs and events .",
    "note the analogy between eqs .",
    "( [ vn - std ] ) and ( [ vnc - std ] ) .",
    "* when using two - particle correlations , one builds a two - point correlator @xmath145 , where @xmath4 is any particle in the same event as those involved in the pair , with the trivial exception of the pair particles to avoid autocorrelations . in opposition to the correlator used in single - particle flow studies , @xmath145 is no longer an even function , so that its fourier expansion has nonvanishing both cosine and sine coefficients which are related to the pair - flow coefficients , namely + @xmath146 + where @xmath16 is the integrated flow while the averages run over all @xmath147 in each event , then over events . once again , eq .",
    "( [ vnc-2cor ] ) is reminiscent of eq .",
    "( [ vn-2cor ] ) , while the difference between eqs .",
    "( [ vn-2corbis ] ) and ( [ vns-2cor ] ) is due to the fact that whereas single - particle emission is symmetric with respect to the reaction plane , pair emission , on the other hand , is not symmetric , see sec .",
    "[ s : definitions ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : angles ] . * to measure the fourier coefficient @xmath49 in the lee - yang zeroes method , one should replace @xmath148 by @xmath149 in the numerator of eq .",

    "@xcite ( resp . ref .",
    "takes the value 1 in the cited equations .",
    "values @xmath150 correspond to higher harmonics , for which the same modifications apply .",
    "] * finally , in the cumulant method , the relevant cumulants when measuring @xmath49 are the _ imaginary _ parts in the power - series expansion of eq .",
    "( 26 - 27 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the real parts are needed for the analysis of single - particle differential flow @xmath135 or of the cosine coefficients @xmath48 . as a result ,",

    "@xcite ) , modulo the replacement @xmath151 , where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are still given by eq .  ( b6 ) in ref .  @xcite .",
    "even if every method of single - particle flow analysis can in principle also be used to measure pair flow , modulo the modifications we described above , there exists a clear difference between the two - particle methods ( both event - plane and two - particle correlation methods ) on the one hand , and the multiparticle approaches on the other hand . as a matter of fact",
    ", we already mentioned that both two - particle methods rely on the assumption that all correlations between two arbitrary particles are due to anisotropic flow ; in other words , that other sources of two - particle correlations are absent , or at most weak  @xcite .",
    "now , if the purpose of using one of these methods is precisely to measure some azimuthally - dependent two - particle effect , the procedure is somehow self - contradictory",
    ". such an inconsistency does not affect the measurement of pair flow through multiparticle methods , since the latter do not assume that two - particle correlations are inexistent , they merely minimize their effect .",
    "in this appendix , we list a few mathematical properties of the pair - flow coefficients @xmath37 for the sake of completeness .",
    "the invariance of the two - particle distribution under the transformation @xmath154 translates into the ( pseudo)periodicity property @xmath155 where @xmath29 has been defined in eq .",
