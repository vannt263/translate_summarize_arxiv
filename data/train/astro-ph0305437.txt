    "nearly half of the bolometric luminosity of the local universe is channeled through the mid- and far - infrared emission of galaxies ; this spectral region directly probes the youngest star - forming regions and their associated interstellar gas and dust .",
    "however , existing infrared ( ir ) instruments have only begun to probe the full ranges in star formation rates , interstellar medium ( ism ) properties , and dynamical environments found in external galaxies .",
    "the sirtf nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) is designed to characterize the infrared emission of present - day galaxies and probe the full range of star formation environments found locally , including regions that until now have been inaccessible at infrared wavelengths .",
    "the observations include imaging and low - resolution spectroscopy of 75 nearby galaxies ( @xmath2 mpc ) , and high - resolution spectroscopy of their centers and a representative set of extranuclear infrared - emitting regions .",
    "these data will be supplemented with an extensive library of ground- and space - based data at other wavelengths .",
    "the primary scientific objective of sings is to use observations of these galaxies at infrared , visible , and ultraviolet wavelengths to obtain complete maps of the current star formation , that are free of most physical biases imposed by interstellar dust .",
    "these will be used in turn to robustly model the extinction , heating , and infrared emission of the dust , and carry out a critical comparison and integration of ultraviolet , h@xmath1 , and infrared - based estimates of star formation rates ( sfrs ) in galaxies .",
    "the infrared spectra will provide spectral diagnostics of the ionized , neutral , molecular , and dusty ism phases of individual star - forming regions , and will probe the interactions between young stars and their surrounding ism over a much wider range of physical and dynamical environments than can be probed in the galaxy .",
    "in addition , sings will provide an archive of spatially - resolved images and spectra of nearby galaxies that will enable a rich set of follow - up investigations of star formation and the ism .",
    "the galaxy sample and observing strategy are designed to maximize the long - term scientific return of the data for the sirtf user community as a whole .",
    "the multi - wavelength archive , which will include sirtf observations as well as a set of @xmath0 , h@xmath1 , paschen-@xmath1 , ultraviolet , far - infrared and submillimeter , x - ray , co , hi , and radio continuum data , will provide a foundation of data and comparison samples for future sirtf general observer ( go ) observing projects by other investigators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the core science program for sings , and highlight some of the many archival applications of the data set . in ",
    "3 we describe the design and the properties of the galaxy sample , and  4 describes the sirtf observations themselves .",
    "the ancillary data being obtained by our team and by other groups are described in  5 . as with all sirtf legacy projects the pipeline data products will be available immediately , with no proprietary period .",
    "however , the sings team will also produce a set of enhanced value data products ( e.g. , mosaicked images , spectral data cubes ) , and software tools , and these are described in  6 . for a general description of sirtf and its instruments",
    "we refer the reader to gallagher , irace , & werner ( 2002 ) .",
    "information on the large - scale distribution of star formation in galaxies , and its coupling to the underlying properties of the ism is critical to a host of larger astrophysical problems the physical nature and origin of the hubble sequence , the structure and phase balance of the ism , the interpretation of observations of the high - redshift universe , the nature and triggering of starbursts and as a lynchpin for the physical understanding and modeling of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "nearby galaxies offer the unique opportunity to study this sfr ",
    "ism coupling on a spatially - resolved basis , over large dynamic ranges in gas density and pressure , metallicity , dust content , and other physically relevant parameters .",
    "sirtf s unique contribution derives from its ability to probe the flow of energy from stars into the ism on scales ranging from the immediate environs of star - forming molecular clouds to the radiative transfer of diffuse radiation on kiloparsec scales ( helou 2000 ) . within star - forming regions , stellar radiation shining on the surrounding gas produces a series of ism components ,",
    "all of which are probed in the infrared .",
    "( figure 1 ) .",
    "ionizing radiation produces an hii  region that is traced by a suite of mid - infrared fine structure lines from species covering a wide range of ionization states . outside of the ionization front",
    "the gas becomes optically thick to hydrogen - ionizing photons , but ultraviolet photons in the range 6 ev @xmath3 13.6 ev dissociate molecules , ionize atoms like c , si , and fe , and heat the gas via grain photoelectric heating to form a photodissociation region or pdr ( hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) .",
    "deeper within the clouds , the warm molecular interface is directly observable via the pure rotational transitions of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath4 ) .",
    "dust grains are present throughout these phases and provide diagnostics of the physical conditions in the star - forming regions , through the thermal continuum emission and the aromatic emission bands .",
    "much of this emission arises from dust grains in hii regions and pdrs , but dust in ambient clouds illuminated by the general interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) can also be important ( lonsdale & helou 1987 ) .",
    "another energy channel  mechanical energy transfer  can be traced via shock - sensitive features such as h@xmath4 , [ siii ] , and [ feii ] .",
    "in contrast to the study of the formation of individual stars , which has advanced dramatically over the past two decades , our theoretical understanding of star formation on galactic scales remains relatively immature .",
    "the limitations begin at the very foundation , with our limited ability to measure and map the large - scale star formation rates ( sfrs ) in galaxies .",
    "ground - based observations using h@xmath1  and other nebular recombination lines and direct observations of the ultraviolet continua of galaxies from space have provided high - resolution maps of star formation in hundreds of nearby galaxies ( kennicutt 1998a and references therein ) .",
    "however the interpretation of these data is limited by interstellar dust , which absorbs roughly half of the emitted ultraviolet ( uv ) and visible radiation of typical star - forming galaxies , and more than 90% in extreme cases such as infrared - luminous starburst galaxies ( e.g. , calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ; wang & heckman 1996 ; buat et al . 1999 , 2002 ;",
    "sullivan et al .",
    "2000 ; bell & kennicutt 2001 , calzetti 2001 ; goldader et al .",
    "2002 ) . since the intensity of the star formation itself",
    "is strongly correlated with the column densities of gas and dust ( kennicutt 1998b ) , the most extincted regions preferentially occur in the regions with highest sfr density . thus our picture of galactic star formation based on visible - uv observations alone is both incomplete and physically biased",
    ". this bias may be even more important at high redshift , where intense and compact starbursts associated with the formation of galactic spheroids are prevalent ( e.g. , barger et al .",
    "2000 ; giavalisco 2002 ) .",
    "a similar physical dichotomy between uv - bright and ir - bright regions is seen on the scale of individual star - forming regions ( kennicutt 1998a , b ) .",
    "the giant ob / hii associations in disks which dominate the visible star formation have mean emitting gas densities of order 10100 @xmath5 , neutral @xmath6 molecular column densities of order @xmath7 @xmath8 and visual extinctions of 03 magnitudes .",
    "by contrast the regions that contain the bulk of star formation in ir - luminous starburst galaxies are located in circumnuclear environments , with typical densities of order @xmath9 @xmath5 , molecular column densities of @xmath10 @xmath8 , and visual extinctions of 51000 magnitudes ( kennicutt 1998a ) .",
    "visible and uv diagnostics can not be applied reliably in these regions , and instead most of our information comes from ir and radio recombination and fine - structure lines . because of this observational segregation between the physical regimes that have been ( in)accessible in the uv  visible and ir , the two sets of spectral diagnostics have not been fully tested against each other , and questions remain about whether we are interpreting the respective sets of spectra in a consistent manner .",
    "the long - standing controversy over whether the initial mass function ( imf ) of young stars in ir - luminous starbursts is radically different from that observed in optically - selected star - forming regions is a prime example of this ambiguity ( e.g. rieke et al . 1993 ; lutz 2000 ; alonso - herrero et al .",
    "an important step toward breaking this impasse is to apply a homogeneous set of ir spectral diagnostics across the entire range of star - forming regions , ranging from the most dust - obscured nuclear regions to objects in the disk that have traditionally been studied using optical spectra .",
    "the infrared astrononical satellite ( iras ) survey detected the integrated dust emission from tens of thousands of nearby galaxies , and revealed a new class of infrared - luminous starburst galaxies ( soifer , neugebauer , & houck 1987 ) . since that time several groups have combined iras data for nearby galaxies with uv and/or h@xmath1  fluxes , to test the reliability of the far - infrared ( fir )",
    "luminosity of a galaxy as a quantitative sfr tracer , and to quantitatively assess the effects of extinction on the uv and optical sfr tracers ( e.g. , helou 1986 ; lonsdale & helou 1987 ; rowan - robinson & crawford 1989 ; devereux & young 1990 ; sauvage & thuan 1992 ; buat & xu 1996 ; walterbos & greenawalt 1996 ; bell & kennicutt 2001 ; buat et al .  2002 ; dopita et al .  2002 ; kewley et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the fir has proven to be a uniquely powerful tracer of the sfr in galaxies dominated by young stars and with high dust optical depths , where the infrared continuum provides a near - bolometric measurement of the stellar radiation output and sfr ( kennicutt 1998b ) .    interpreting this emission in normal galaxies",
    "has proven to be more difficult , however . there",
    "the dust can also be heated by older stars , and the fractional contribution of this  cirrus \" component to the total fir emission is a strong function of galaxy properties and the sfr itself ( helou 1986 ; lonsdale & helou 1987 ; rowan - robinson & crawford 1989 ; walterbos & greenawalt 1996 ) . moreover",
    ", the infrared emission may under - represent the output of regions with low dust content . despite these concerns recent work comparing the reddening - corrected h@xmath1-based and fir - derived",
    "sfrs show a surprisingly good agreement over a wide range of galaxy types and sfrs , which suggests that at least for normal galaxies the effects of older stars and dust opacity on the fir are less serious than anticipated ( e.g. , dopita et al .  2002 ; kewley et al .",
    "unfortunately it is difficult to model the effects of dust extinction and dust heating in a realistic way , because of the complex geometry of the dust and heating sources , and the absence of high - quality fir data .",
    "the best spatial resolution achievable in the far - infrared iras images is of the order of an arcminute , and for all but the nearest galaxies this is insufficient to robustly model the dust heating and radiation reprocessing .",
    "major inroads into addressing these problems have come from the the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , which provided higher - resolution imaging as well as spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the 3200  range ( kessler et al .",
    "several surveys directed at nearby normal galaxies were carried out , including the iso key project on the interstellar medium of normal galaxies ( helou et al .",
    "1996 ) , which obtained comprehensive imaging and spectroscopy for a sample of 60 galaxies with a wide range of infrared and optical properties ( dale et al .  2001",
    "; malhotra et al .  2001 ; lu et al .  2003 ) .",
    "other major programs included an imaging survey of 77 shapley - ames spiral and s0 galaxies ( bendo et al .",
    "2002a , b , 2003 ) , surveys of the virgo cluster ( boselli et al .  1998 ; tuffs et al .  2002 ;",
    "popescu & tuffs 2002 ; popescu et al .",
    "2002 ) , and an imaging and spectroscopic survey of normal and barred spiral galaxies ( roussel et al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "the superior spatial resolution of iso relative to iras provided valuable new information on the distribution of emitting dust and the associated star formation in galaxies , but this advantage was mainly limited to wavelengths shortward of 15 @xmath11 m , where the dust emission is dominated by band emission from small aromatic hydrocarbon dust grains ( e.g. , cesarsky et al .  1996 ;",
    "helou et al .",
    "2000 ; sturm et al .",
    "2000 ; hunter et al .  2001 ; roussel et al .  2001a , b ) .",
    "an example is shown in figure  2 , which compares an iso map of the nearby galaxy ngc  6946 ( a member of the sings sample ) with a groundbased h@xmath1  image ( dale et al .",
    "it is clear that in the outer disk the h@xmath1emission and dust emission trace the same general star formation component .",
    "however there are large local variations in the infrared / h@xmath1  intensity ratio , which are due to changes in dust opacity , radiation field intensity , and differences in the ages of the star - forming regions .",
    "the emission from the central starburst is much stronger in the infrared ( relative to the visible ) , because of the much higher optical depth of dust in that region . because the local intensity of star formation itself tends to correlate with gas and dust column density ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998b ;",
    "also see fig .",
    "4 ) , the infrared emission provides a probe of the most intense starbursts that is virtually inaccessible in the visible and ultraviolet .",
    "iso has also made a major contribution by producing mid- and far - infrared spectra for a sample of infrared - luminous galaxies , and for a few lower - extinction star - forming regions in disks ( e.g. sturm et al .",
    "2000 ; thornley et al .",
    "2000 ; helou et al .",
    "2000 ; malhotra et al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ) .",
    "the richness of emission - line and emission - band diagnostics in this region of the spectrum is illustrated in figure  3 , which shows iso sws spectra of m82 and the circinus galaxy with the principal diagnostic lines labeled .",
    "these include ionized tracers of stellar photoionized hii regions ( e.g. , [ neii ]  12.8@xmath11 m , [ neiii ]  15.6@xmath11 m , [ siii ]  18.7 ,  33.5@xmath11 m , [ siv ]  10.5@xmath11 m ) , high - ionization tracers for application to agns , shocks , and very hot stars ( e.g. , [ oiv ]  25.9@xmath11 m , [ nev ]  14.3@xmath11 m ) , low - ionization tracers of shocks and pdr regions ( [ feii ]  26.0@xmath11 m , [ siii ]  34.8@xmath11 m ) , the s(0 ) and s(1 ) molecular rotational lines of h@xmath4 ( 17 and 28 @xmath11 m ) , and the pah dust bands in the 514  region .",
    "spectroscopy of [ cii ]  158  in normal star - forming galaxies has provided insight into the microphysics of the ism .",
    "galaxies with warmer far - infrared colors ( larger 60/100  @xmath11 m  flux ratios ) show a smooth decline in the [ cii]/fir ratio ( malhotra et al .",
    "2001 ) , which has been attributed to less efficient photo - ejection of electrons from increasingly charged small grains in more actively star forming regions .",
    "this interpretation is supported by a strong correlation between [ cii ] line emission and 510  dust emission in star - forming galaxies ( helou et al .",
    "2001 ) , because the latter is a measure of the small grain photoelectric heating rate .    in terms of iso continuum spectroscopy",
    ", we have learned that the mid - ir spectrum ( @xmath12 ) is nearly shape - invariant on the scale of galaxies , as a consequence of the single - photon heating nature of the pah dust ( draine & li 2001 ) .",
    "the shape of the complete infrared spectrum can be parametrized by a single variable , the 60/100  @xmath11 m  flux ratio ( helou et al.2000 ; dale & helou 2002 ; lu et al . 2003 ) . both of these discoveries bode well for interpreting high - z galaxies using ir spectral templates based on nearby galaxies .",
    "sirtf promises a breakthrough in this field , because it will produce spatially - resolved infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies with sufficient angular and spectral resolution to separate individual dust emission and heating components .",
    "the sirtf images have sufficient sensitivity to map the thermal dust emission over most or all of the optical extent of spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "likewise the spectroscopic sensitivity of sirtf makes it possible to apply a consistent set of diagnostics across the local populations of galaxies and star - forming regions .    to contribute optimally to these investigations",
    ", sirtf must be used in a manner that is best adapted to its finite angular resolution .",
    "we have therefore adopted a two - part strategy .",
    "in the first part , 75 galaxies will be imaged completely with irac and mips , and partially mapped with low - resolution spectroscopy , to characterize the global infrared and star - forming properties of nearby galaxies , and explore their dependencies on type and other integrated properties . in the second part , we will use complete spectroscopic observations to physically characterize a set of discrete infrared - emitting sources .",
    "these include the nuclear regions of each of the 75 galaxies , and observations of 75 extranuclear regions in @xmath1320 of the galaxies , divided between visible star - forming regions and infrared - bright objects discovered with our sirtf images , chosen to contain the complete range of physical characteristics .",
    "the combination of these two data sets will fully characterize the infrared properties of normal galaxies , and enable a broad set of astrophysical applications .",
    "a major focus of our analysis will be to test and develop improved diagnostics of sfrs in galaxies , based on a critical comparison of the ultraviolet , h@xmath1 , and infrared data ( e.g. , popescu et al.2000 ; roussel et al .",
    "2001a ; bell et al .",
    "the key to breaking the degeneracies that currently limit the modeling of extinction and dust heating is to map the re - radiated dust emission on angular scales that are comparable to those of individual infrared - emitting ( and star - forming ) regions . in most star - forming galaxies",
    "the bulk of the dust radiation is emitted in the far - infrared , with a peak between 50 and 150 ( figure  1 and dale et al .",
    "2000 ; dale & helou 2002 ; bendo et al .",
    "hence a central element of our program is imaging of the sings galaxies at 24160  with mips , and sed mapping at 1099  with irs and mips . at the shorter wavelengths these maps will possess comparable or superior resolution to the isocam 15  maps illustrated in figure 2 , and even at the longest wavelengths we will obtain images with over 200 resolution elements for a median - size galaxy in our sample ( @xmath14 10 , where @xmath15 denotes the isophotal diameter from the rc3 : de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the irac camera on sirtf will allow us to measure the mid - infrared dust emission at @xmath132  resolution .",
    "although this spectral region ( 58 ) is roughly a factor of ten shortward of the thermal dust emission peak , and the radiation is dominated by band emission from molecular aggregates or small grains , studies with iso reveal a surprisingly good correlation between the dust emissivity at these wavelengths and the sfr , over an extended range of physical conditions and spatial scales ( roussel et al .",
    "we will test the reliability of the mid - infrared emission as a quantitative sfr tracer , as it offers the tantalizing prospect of mapping star formation in galaxies on arcsecond angular scales .",
    "the products of this analysis will be maps of the total star formation , as well as maps of the uv  visible extinction and separate distributions for the uv - bright and dust - obscured star formation .",
    "these will allow us to delineate the broad trends in sfr as functions of local and global galaxy properties , and they will reveal any systematic differences between the distribution and amounts of obscured _ vs. _ unobscured star formation that may be present , as functions of radial location , metallicity , galaxy type , or dynamical environment ( e.g. , kennicutt 1983 , 1998a ; roussel et al .",
    "since the infrared - bright regions preferentially trace the densest and youngest star - forming environments , such patterns must be present .",
    "another area of investigation will be the combination of the sfr distributions with spatially - resolved co and hi maps to probe the form of the star formation law over the full range of ism environments found in nearby galaxies .",
    "the potential of such an analysis is illustrated in figure 4 ( taken from kennicutt 1998b ) , which compares the disk - averaged sfrs and gas densities in normal galaxies ( symbol ) and infrared - selected starburst galaxies ( symbol ) .",
    "there appears to be a single schmidt law ( index n @xmath13 1.4  1.5 ) which reproduces the sfrs across this range of regimes .",
    "we will combine the spatially - resolved sfrs maps with gas density data from the berkeley illinois millimeter array survey of nearby galaxies ( bima song ) project ( helfer et al .",
    "2003 ) and high - resolution hi maps ( see   5.5 ) to test whether this law holds on a point - by - point basis .",
    "any such application is limited by the validity of the co emissivity as a molecular gas tracer , of course , and the dust masses derived from the sirtf sed maps should enable us to place some useful limits on the variability of the co / h@xmath4 conversion factor .",
    "other applications will include direct mapping of the dust density and temperature distributions ( e.g. , dale et al .",
    "2000 ; li & draine 2002 ) , construction of an improved radiative transfer model for dust in galaxies using the dirty code ( gordon et al .  2001 ; misselt et al .",
    "2001 ) , and use of the unprecendented sensitivity of sirtf to search for dust in gas - poor galaxies , metal - poor objects , and in the halos of galaxies .",
    "sirtf will also allow us for the first time to apply the powerful suite of mid - infrared spectral diagnostics to galactic ir - emitting components that span the full range of metallicities , densities , extinctions , and radiation field properties found in normal galaxies .",
    "these observations provide the link between the observed infrared spectra of galaxies and the physical conditions in the emitting gas and dust , and are crucial inputs for interpreting the integrated seds and spectra of high - redshift objects and more luminous starburst galaxies .",
    "they will also allow us to study the dependence of the physical and chemical properties of the dust ( e.g. , size distribution , composition ) on environmental conditions such as metal abundance and sfr .    as a quantitative illustration of the sensitivity of sirtf for these applications",
    ", we can apply the nominal pre - launch instrumental sensitivity estimates for a few applications of interest . for a galaxy at a fiducial distance of 3.5mpc ( the distance of the m81 group , a primary component of our sample ) , the spatial resolution of the telescope projects to linear dimensions ranging from 40pc ( 2 pixels , 2.58@xmath11 m ) to 100 , 300 , and 700pc ( @xmath16/d respectively at 24 , 70 , and 160@xmath11 m ) . at this distance a 10s set of mips integrations at 24 , 70 , and 160@xmath11 m  will detect with 10-@xmath17 significance a star forming region with sfr = @xmath18  yr@xmath19 ( comparable to the orion core ) , with a typical cloud mass ( gas @xmath6 dust ) of order @xmath20m@xmath21 . likewise a 10s integration set with irac can detect the dust emission from @xmath1310@xmath22  m@xmath21  of ism illuminated by the average isrf .",
    "these cloud masses correspond to limiting gas column densities over the respective resolution elements of order a few times @xmath23 to @xmath24 h  @xmath8 , with deeper limits achievable with longer integration times . for high - resolution spectroscopy , irs would measure the [ neii ]  12.8  @xmath11memission line from a orion - luminosity region at 10-@xmath17 significance in a 30s integration , or the h@xmath4 emission from the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines at 17 and 28  @xmath11 m  of a @xmath25 m@xmath21  cloud at 100  k in 500s ( again at 10@xmath17 significance ) .",
    "these numbers serve to illustrate the wide range of applications that will be possible either with the sings archive or follow - up go observations . when the irs spectra are combined with the ir seds and uv - visible spectra we will be able to carry out powerful cross - checks on the sfr and dust properties of the regions as diagnosed by the independent tracers .",
    "specific investigations will include the use of the aromatic features in emission ( afe s ) to constrain dust heating and radiative transfer models ( e.g. , boselli et al .",
    "1998 ; helou et al .",
    "2000 , li & draine 2001 , 2002 ) , and as possible direct indicators of the sfr , as described earlier .",
    "spectra of the ionized regions will be used to constrain systematic variations in the stellar temperatures and imfs in the galaxies , and to test the strong mid - infrared lines as quantitative sfr tracers ( e.g. , roche et al .",
    "observations of the low - ionization lines ( e.g. , [ siii ]  34.8@xmath11 m , [ feii ]  26.0@xmath11 m ) and h@xmath4 rotational lines will be used to test for systematic differences in the physical conditions in the environments of circumnuclear and disk star - forming regions , and to test shock , hii  region , and photodissociation diagostics based on these lines , over a much larger range of physical conditions than can be probed in the galaxy .      as with all of the sirtf legacy science projects ,",
    "the target samples and observing strategy were designed to support a wide range of scientific applications beyond the core program described in the previous section .",
    "a comprehensive description of the types of archival applications of the sings data is beyond the scope of this paper , but a few examples will serve to illustrate the variety of potential applications .",
    "one of our primary data products will be a complete galaxy sed library , including broadband integrated seds covering 0.4160@xmath11 m , and eventually with extended coverage over 0.15  850  for many objects , when our seds are integrated with observations from galex and jcmt ( see  5 ) .",
    "a spectral library of the 150 discrete sources ( circumnuclear regions , extranuclear hii regions , extranuclear ir sources ) will also be produced , covering the 537  range , and with matching optical spectra or emission - line fluxes over the 0.360.7  range for most regions .",
    "these data should be especially useful for interpreting data from other legacy programs ( e.g. , goods , swire ) , for interpreting submillimeter surveys of distant galaxies , and for planning future facilities such as alma , herschel , and safir .",
    "the same data should be useful for modeling the composite emission from ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , and by helping to identifying the truly unique physical attributes of these objects ( not represented in the normal galaxies in our sample ) , and thus constrain their origins and evolutionary paths .",
    "the irac images at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath11 m , when combined with groundbased near - infrared images , and correcting for hot dust emission at these wavelengths , can provide constraints on the stellar mass distributions in galaxies , and these are relevant to a wide range of problems including bar structures , spiral density waves , and better constraining the dark matter properties of galaxies , e.g. , by modeling the stellar mass  to  light ratio . the wide range of inclinations in the sample can also be used to study the extinction properties of disks as a function of wavelengths , and address the long - standing debate over the opacities of galactic disks at visible and near - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , valentijn 1994 ; giovanelli et al .",
    "1994 ; burstein 1994 ) .",
    "the sings data will also provide several means of studying the spatial distribution of hot and cold dust in galaxies ( e.g. , lu et al .",
    "the irac bandpasses have been selected to allow separation of aromatic emission band features from ( largely ) continuum regions , and thus it will be possible to construct high - resolution emission maps of the warm dust . at longer wavelengths",
    "sirtf will offer unprecendented sensitivity to emission from the cold  cirrus \" component of dust , and these can be used to test for the presence of dust halos , streamers , or clouds around nearby galaxies ( e.g. , nelson et al .",

    "1998 , trewhella et al .",
    "2000 , stickel et al .",
    "the mips images can also be used to place strong limits on the total ism ( gas + dust ) contents of early - type galaxies .",
    "although it is not a main component of the sings core science program , the connection between agn activity and circumnuclear star formation activity can be explored in detail with these data .",
    "the sample contains the full range of nuclear types , including hii region , liner , and seyfert nuclei .",
    "the availability of high - resolution spectra in the 1037  region ( and low resolution at 514 ) will make it possible to compare the physical conditions and ionization properties of the regions from fine - structure line diagnostics with those derived from optical spectra .",
    "the centers of the sings galaxies will be spectroscopically mapped at 15 positions (  4 ) , providing some separation of nuclear and circumnuclear emission , within the limitations imposed by the spatial resolution of sirtf ( @xmath1329  fwhm at 537 ) .    as a final example",
    ", a wide range of gasdynamical processes , including large - scale shocks produced by bars , spiral density waves , and interactions are manifested in the mid - ir continuum and the shock sensitive [ siii ] , [ feii ] , and h@xmath4 features .",
    "the irac imaging and low - resolution irs sed strips should isolate examples of these shocks , which can be followed up with pointed spectroscopy as part of the sirtf go program .",
    "in order to maximize the archival value of the sings dataset , and to incorporate as diverse a population of galaxies and infrared emitting regions as possible , we adopted a physically - based approach to defining the samples .",
    "these address the needs of the scientific program described in the previous section , and also provide representative samples for other astrophysical applications , as well as reference and control samples for future go observing programs .      in order to achieve the scientific goals described above and at the same time to maximize the archival value of survey , we decided from the outset to observe as diverse a set of local _ normal _ galaxies as possible .",
    "the size and precise nature of the sample , however , was heavily influenced by a set of technical considerations .",
    "the principal limiting factor in the performance of sirtf for this type of science is its angular resolution , which ranges from about 2  with irac to 40 in the 160  imaging channel of mips . to maximize the linear resolution we need to study nearby objects .",
    "we found that most of the range of normal galaxy properties could be covered by a sample with a maximum distance of 30 mpc ; the median distance of the sample is 9.5mpc ( for h@xmath26 = 70kms@xmath19mpc@xmath19 ) .",
    "most of the irac and mips imaging channels cover a field of 5  square , so to make efficient use of the observing time we selected most of our galaxies to have sizes in the 515  range ( a few smaller galaxies were included in order to cover the full physical parameter space described below ) .",
    "finally , the sample size was dictated by a balance between achieving a representative range of galaxy properties and practical limitations in observing time .",
    "this led to a sample of 75 galaxies , requiring 512 hours of sirtf time .    to construct a sample of candidate galaxies we adopted a methodology used in the iso key project ( helou et al .",
    "1996 ) , and considered a 3-dimensional parameter space of physical properties : morphological type ( which also correlates with bulge / disk structure , gas fraction , and sfr per unit mass ) , luminosity ( which also correlates with galaxy mass , internal velocity , and mean metallicity ) , and fir / optical luminosity ratio ( which also correlates with the dust optical depth , dust temperature , and inclination ) .",
    "we examined the distribution of nearby galaxies in this 3-dimensional space and selected objects that cover the full range of properties that ought to be detectable with sirtf .",
    "specifically , we chose roughly a dozen galaxies in each rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) type ( e  s0 , sa ",
    "i0 ) , which covered the full combination of luminosity and infrared / optical ratio .",
    "figure 5 shows the distribution of sings galaxies in this parameter space .",
    "the sample is very diverse , covering a factor of @xmath20 in infrared luminosity and @xmath27 in l@xmath28/l@xmath29 .    when constructing the sample we also took pains to cover a representative range of other galaxy properties , including nuclear activity ( quiescent , starburst , liner , seyfert ) , inclination , surface brightness , co / hi ratio , bar structure , spiral arm structure ( grand - design vs flocculent ) , and environment ( i.e. , isolated galaxies , interacting galaxies , group members , and cluster members ) . our goal was not to cover a representative range of all of these secondary properties ( impossible with a sample of only 75 galaxies ) , but rather to avoid introducing an unintended bias into the sample with respect to any of these properties .",
    "the final selection of galaxies also took into account practical factors such as galactic and ecliptic latitude .",
    "we excluded most galaxies near the galactic plane to avoid high background at long wavelengths ( from interstellar cirrus emission ) , and to avoid a high density of foreground stars at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "we also avoided concentrating too much of the program near the ecliptic equator , where the zodiacal background is high and scheduling of observations is more constrained . however",
    "some important regions lie near the ecliptic equator ( e.g. , virgo cluster , leo groups ) , so some observations in this region were unavoidable .",
    "table  1 summarizes the range of properties in the sings sample , and table  2 gives a complete listing of the galaxies and some of their relevant properties .",
    "although our sample comprises representative cross section of galaxies found in the local supercluster , it does not include the absolute extremes in properties that can be found over larger local volumes . for example , we did not include any examples of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) , luminous agns , cd galaxies , dwarf spheroidal galaxies , the most extreme metal - poor dwarf galaxies , or luminous low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "this was either because the objects would not be spatially resolved at the longest wavelengths measured by sirtf ( e.g. , uligs ) , or because ample samples of such galaxies already are included as reserved observations in the guaranteed time observers ( gto ) program . in order to maximize the science return on the sirtf observing time we chose to avoid duplication , in favor of eventually integrating any needed gto data into future analyses .",
    "the deliberate emphasis on constructing a physically diverse sample also means that sings should not be regarded as a representative , randomly drawn sample of the local universe , in either a volume - limited or flux - limited sense .",
    "this point in illustrated in figure  6 , which compares the distribution of 60  luminosities of the sings galaxies with the local infrared luminosity function from strauss & huchra ( 1988 ) .",
    "we deliberately constructed the sings sample to sample roughly equal logarithmic bins in luminosity , and this is reflected in the flat distribution in figure  6 . as a result",
    "the number of ir - faint galaxies ( mostly dwarfs ) is underrepresented relative to their actual space densities .",
    "likewise the sample lacks any ultraluminous objects , as mentioned earlier .",
    "this selection should be borne in mind when interpreting results from the sings sample as a whole , and particularly when using the survey as a control sample for follow - up go studies .",
    "nevertheless the sample covers the range of galaxy types and star formation environments that are responsible for @xmath3095% of the total infrared emission in the local universe ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "although it was impractical to construct a fully volume - representative sample for sings , we decided to incorporate one complete luminosity - limited subsample into the survey , namely the m81 group ( tully 1987 ; karachentsev et al .",
    "our sample includes including m81 , m82 , ngc  2403 , ngc  2976 , ngc  4236 , ic  2574 , ho  i , ho  ii , ho  ix , ddo  53 , ddo  165 , m81 dwa , and m81 dwb .",
    "four other group members , ngc  2366 , ngc  3077 , ugc  4486 , and vii zw 403 are already in the reserved observation catalog , and those data eventually will be available to complete coverage of the group .",
    "the m81 group offers the advantages of proximity ( d @xmath31 3.5 mpc ) , high visibility for sirtf , and a diverse galaxy population , ranging from extreme dwarfs ( @xmath32 for m81  dwb ) to a large spiral ( m81 ) and the nearest example of an infrared - luminous starburst galaxy ( m82 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic sample is comprised of the nuclear regions of 74 of the 75 sings galaxies ( the center of m82 is a reserved target , to be mapped by the irs instrument team ) , and 75 extra - nuclear regions .",
    "the extranuclear targets are divided between @xmath1340 optically - selected ob / hii regions and @xmath1335 infrared - selected regions , most of which will be chosen from the sings images themselves .    a similar physically - based approach has been used to define the extra - nuclear target sample .",
    "the optically - selected hii  regions are located in nine of the nearest sings galaxies , and were chosen to span wide ranges in metal abundance ( 0.1  3 @xmath33 ) , extinction - corrected ionizing luminosity ( q@xmath34 photons",
    "s@xmath19 ) , visual extinction ( 04 mag ) , radiation field intensity ( 100-fold range ) , ionizing stellar temperature ( @xmath35 = 35  55 kk ) , and local h@xmath4/hi  ratio ( @xmath360.1 to @xmath3010 ) , as inferred from co and 21  cm maps .",
    "we have restricted the optically - selected hii  regions to those with extinction - corrected @xmath37 w m@xmath38 ( corresponding to @xmath39 w m@xmath38 ) , to ensure adequate detection of the main fine - structure lines in a reasonable exposure time .",
    "table 3 lists the current candidate spectroscopic targets along with their relevant physical properties .",
    "optically - selected hii  regions cover only part of the full population of bright star - forming regions and infrared sources , so it is important to independently select a subsample of extranuclear targets from infrared maps .",
    "we have used published isocam mid - infrared maps to select some of the target regions listed in table 3 , and will select at least 30 additional targets from the sings images , on the basis of infrared luminosity , mid - infrared colors , and infrared - optical flux ratios .",
    "this will ensure a fully representative sampling of the sings extranuclear source population as a whole , including totally optically - obscurred objects that would never have been selected at other wavelengths .",
    "in addition a number of infrared - bright circumnuclear regions will be included in the sings observations of the centers of these galaxies .",
    "in keeping with the archival design of the sings observing program , we chose to maximize the homogeneity of the imaging and spectroscopic dataset across the 75 galaxy sample .",
    "our basic observing strategy is depicted in figure 7 , which shows an isocam image of a sings target , ngc  6946 , on three scales with the footprints of the mips , irac , and irs observations overlaid . for each galaxy full - coverage imaging",
    "( to @xmath40 ) will be obtained at all 7 irac and mips channels ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.5 , 24 , 70 , 160 ) , with sufficient additional sky coverage to allow for a robust background subtraction .",
    "the coarse spectral sampling of the broadband mips and irac maps by themselves is insufficient to constrain the infrared sed shapes of galaxies , much less diagnose the temperature distributions and properties of the emitting grains , as illustrated in figure 8 .",
    "therefore we are supplementing our imaging with irs 1440@xmath11mspectral maps and mips 5299@xmath11 m  sed mode strip scans in all 75 galaxies .",
    "these will permit robust modeling of the dust continuum and heating over a several square arcminute slice of each galaxy , and with the images help constrain the spectral shapes throughout the disks .",
    "additional spectral maps will be obtained at 514  and 1037(at high resolution ) for the centers of every galaxy except m82 , and for the 75 extra - nuclear regions described earlier .",
    "the remainder of this section describes the sings observing strategy in detail .",
    "this information is provided in part for the benefit of prospective sirtf proposers , who may find it useful for planning their own imaging or spectroscopic observations of nearby galaxies or other bright extended sources .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table  4 ; readers who are only interested in the data products may wish to skip the detailed discussion .",
    "a majority of our galaxies are larger than the 5  format of the irac detectors , so we will construct mosaics from multiple pointings to provide the necessary field coverage . a generous overlap ( 50% ) between adjacent exposures will provide robust cross - registration of the images , determination of bias drifts , and cosmic ray rejection .",
    "after one series of exposures we will have observed all locations in the central part of the mosaic four times . because the four irac detectors map two non - overlapping fields of view , mosaics of the larger galaxies will include regions above and below which are only observed in two of the four channels .",
    "these regions are located well outside of the galaxies , and will be used to measure the sky background level .",
    "the sensitivity of irac is sufficiently high to saturate the detectors in the inner regions and in bright spiral arms , where 7  surface brightnesses of up to hundreds of mjy  sr@xmath19 are expected ( dale et al .",
    "1999 ) . to address this problem",
    "we will observe the sings galaxies in a high dynamic range mode , in which an additional short exposure ( 12s ) is obtained .",
    "this will allow us to correct for any saturated pixels in the longer exposures .",
    "we will image in all four irac bandpasses ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0  ) to at least the full optical radii ( @xmath41 ) of the galaxies .",
    "the four 256@xmath42256 element detectors observe adjacent regions of the sky simultaneously , each covers a region of 5@xmath425with 12 pixels .",
    "galaxies with @xmath43  will be observed in a pair of four - position dithered exposure sets .",
    "dithered exposures will enable us to recover somewhat more spatial information in the reconstructed images , as described in  6.1 . in order to facilitate the detection and removal of asteroids ( a significant contamimation for targets near the ecliptic ) , our observations",
    "will be carried out in two sets of exposures separated by 124h .",
    "a majority of our galaxies are larger than the 5  format of the irac detectors , so we will construct mosaics from multiple pointings to provide the necessary field coverage . a generous overlap ( 50% ) between adjacent exposures will provide robust cross - registration of the images , determination of bias drifts , and cosmic ray rejection .",
    "after one series of exposures we will have observed all locations in the central part of the mosaic four times . because the four irac detectors map two non - overlapping fields of view , mosaics of the galaxies will include regions above and below which are only observed in two of the four channels .",
    "these regions are located well outside of the galaxies , and will be used to measure the sky background level . like the smaller galaxies , each mosaiced galaxy will be observed twice to allow for the detection of asteroids .",
    "so there will be a total of eight exposures for all locations in the central part of the mosaic .    in keeping with the overall design strategy of the sings project we will obtain uniform exposure times ( per detector field ) across the galaxy sample ,",
    "apart from small variations within individual mosaics depending on how many times a given region of sky is covered by a particular detector .",
    "the baseline integration time per pointing ( 30s ) was chosen as a compromise between providing acceptable signal / noise across the galaxies and keeping the total observing time to a practical level ( 45h ) .",
    "for moderate zodiacal backgrounds ( the dominant source at these wavelengths ) we expect a limiting 1-@xmath17 sensitivity of 0.04  mjy  sr@xmath19 , which is comparable to the expected average 7  surface brightness of a typical sings galaxy at r@xmath44 ( dale et al .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio improves at smaller radii and shorter wavelengths .",
    "for example , we expect to get a signal - to - noise ratio per pixel of @xmath135 for detecting stellar photospheres at r@xmath44 .",
    "since the zodiacal background varies by factors of several over the sky , the limiting sensitivities are expected to vary by about @xmath454050%  across the sample",
    ". however these variations will be small in comparison to the intrinsic variations in infrared emission among the galaxies themselves .",
    "the sensitivity of irac is sufficiently high to saturate the detectors in the inner regions and in bright spiral arms , where 7  surface brightnesses of up to hundreds of mjy  sr@xmath19 are expected ( dale et al .",
    "1999 ) . to address this problem",
    "we will observe the sings galaxies in a high dynamic range mode , in which an additional short exposure ( 12s ) is obtained .",
    "this will allow us to correct for any saturated pixels in the longer exposures .",
    "each galaxy in the sample will be imaged in all 3 mips bands ( 24 , 70 , and 160  ) .",
    "we set as a goal a minimum s / n = 3 at r@xmath44 in all three bandpasses .",
    "to estimate the surface brightness levels required , we used the radial profiles of 11 nearby , face - on galaxies observed with the iras satellite , and processed with the hires algorithm to provide maximum spatial resolution ( auman , fowler , & melnick 1990 ; kerton & martin 2001 ) .",
    "these profiles were then used to determine the 25  and 60surface brightness at @xmath41 in each galaxy .",
    "this exercise yielded average values of 0.21  mjy  sr@xmath19 at 25  and 0.51  mjy  sr@xmath19 at 60 , in very good agreement with the mid - infrared estimates above , when extrapolated to longer wavelengths using typical galaxy seds ( dale et al .",
    "we adopted these values as the 3@xmath17 sensitivity goals at 24  and 70 .",
    "typical galaxy surface brightnesses at 160  are comparable to or greater than those at 60  ( engargiola 1991 ; bendo et al .",
    "2002a ) , so we also set a sensitivity goal of 0.51  mjy  sr@xmath19 at 160 .",
    "the 3@xmath17 goals above are equivalent to @xmath46 point - source sensitivities of @xmath47jy , 1.9  mjy , and 6.1  mjy , respectively . as with the irac observations , variations in zodiacal background ( at 24 ) and interstellar background ( at 70 and 160 ) will affect the actual results , but even in the high background regions we expect to achieve these sensitivity targets within a factor of two .",
    "observations of galaxies at 70  and 160  impose special challenges for observations and data processing with mips , because of the extended low surface brightness structure in the sources , the difficulty of separating physical structures from transient features in the ge : ga detectors , and foreground structures such as interstellar cirrus in the milky way galaxy .",
    "for that reason we describe the design of our observing and data analysis strategies in some detail , in hopes that it may aid future sirtf users in designing their observing programs .    at the wavelengths covered by mips our observations",
    "will be confusion limited , and the sensitivity of the detectors is sufficient to detect most regions in exposure times of seconds .",
    "consequently we have chosen to use short integration times ( 34  s ) , and multiple integrations on each region , to minimize saturation effects and ensure a high level of redundancy in the data . for expected average background levels ( young et al .",
    "1998 ) , the nominal sensitivities given above are achieved in 1 photometry cycle at 70 and 160  , and is within 10% of being achieved after 4 cycles at 24  .",
    "multiple photometry cycles ( 23 , depending on wavelength ) will be obtained to ensure sufficient redundancy for removal of detector transients , meet the sensitivity goals , enable super - resolution capability ( 160  ) , and produce consistently high - quality images . as with the irac imaging the observations",
    "will be divided into two sets offset by 1.5 160  pixels , and separated by at least 3  h to detect asteroids .",
    "the mips instrument enables imaging to be obtained either in a conventional  photometry \" mode , or in a ",
    "scan map \" mode , in which a scanning mirror allows for continuous integration over large areas of sky .",
    "we will use the small - field photometry modes for sources smaller than about d@xmath48 , and large - field photometry modes for sources up to d@xmath49 .",
    "larger galaxies will be imaged using the mips scan map mode . to improve sampling and mitigate the effects of bad pixels at 160   each scan leg",
    "will be offset from the previous one by one - half the array width , using the @xmath50 cross - scan step in both the forward and reverse directions .",
    "this imaging strategy ensures that each point on the sky will be observed by at least 40 ( 4 at 160  ) independent pixels . due to the ge",
    ": ga transient behavior , we feel that 4 observations are the minimum required to generate high - quality data .",
    "we will perform a small raster of sed mode observations ( 5299  ) in a radial strip in each galaxy , designed to overlap with the irs low - resolution strip scans ( below ) . in most galaxies ( d@xmath51 ) , this raster will consist of 7 positions , overlapped by half the slit width to cover in full a @xmath52 region . in galaxies larger than 10 , a second , similar set of sed observations will be added to produce a @xmath131@xmath53 map .",
    "scheduling constraints are used to ensure that these strips be oriented as closely as possible to the irs spectral maps , so we will cover the same regions in the galaxies at 1440  and 5299  .",
    "we used the radial profiles of nearby galaxies discussed above to estimate the typical surface brightnesses at r = 24 , and computed the integration times required .",
    "the fainter regions correspond to @xmath131.2  mjy  sr@xmath19 , which implies a @xmath46 sensitivity of 4.5  mjy on a point source to achieve @xmath54 sensitivity at that surface brightness .",
    "this is achieved in 4 cycles of 10  s integrations , so we will perform two cycles at each map position so that the half - slit - width overlaps provide the total integration time required .",
    "the irs observations consist of : ( 1 ) low - resolution radial strip maps of all 75 galaxies in the long - low channel ( 14.240.0@xmath11 m ) ; ( 2 ) targeted spectroscopy of the centers of all 75 galaxies and 75 extranuclear sources in a subset of galaxies , at 5.314.2@xmath11m(low resolution ) , and 10.037.0@xmath11 m  ( high resolution ) .",
    "we will obtain 0.9-wide spectral maps for all galaxies from 14.2 to 40.0@xmath11 m  using the irs low resolution mode , maximally overlapping the mips sed strip .",
    "these irs strips will extend radially to about 0.55@xmath41 , where the average surface brightness is @xmath551  mjy  sr@xmath19 ( dale et al .",
    "2000 ) . to minimize the effects of cosmic rays and bad pixels , we will spatially quadruple - sample by executing half - slit ( length and width ) steps parallel and perpendicular to the long - low slits .",
    "since the irs short - low subslits are about one arcmin long and are almost perpendicular to the long - low slits , we will complement the 1-wide long - low strip maps with short - low maps (   [ sec : targeted_low_res ] ) , to obtain complete wavelength coverage from 5.3 to 40.0 @xmath11 m  in the nuclear regions . again using the @xmath56+_iso_-based spectral model of dale et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we find that exposure times of 30 seconds give s / n @xmath57 for a 15  @xmath11 m  surface brightness of @xmath131  mjy  sr@xmath19 , for the cirrus - like seds in the outer disks .",
    "low - resolution spectral maps from 5.314.2@xmath11 m , nyquist - sampled over a 03@xmath4209 region , will be obtained for the centers of each galaxy and the 75 extranuclear regions .",
    "this region of the spectrum is especially valuable for measuring the aromatic dust emission bands from small grains ( including pah species ) .",
    "since the galaxy centers will also be covered by the 14.240.0@xmath11 m  and 5299@xmath11 m  sed strips , we will have nearly complete spectral coverage of these regions .",
    "moreover , the 55  sub - slit length will enable useful observations of extended sources , and the serendipitous regions simultaneously covered by the other sub - slit will provide data on the local background and quiescent disk regions .",
    "we will use exposures of 14s for the nuclei and 60s for extranuclear regions .",
    "based on the range of observed mid - infrared surface brightnesses for the _ iso _  key project galaxies ( @xmath58  mjy  sr@xmath19 ) , we expect s / n @xmath59 5 in the core of each target .      as for the low - resolution strip maps , we will map targeted regions with high spectral resolution , using a 5@xmath423 grid pattern of half - slit length and half - slit width steps , as shown in the righthand panel in figure  7 .",
    "most of our targets are spatially extended , with significant emission structure over scales comparable to the sizes of the irs short - high aperture . as a result",
    "it would be very difficult to obtain accurate spectrophotometry across the entire wavelength range ( 1037 ) with a single pointing observation , because the size of the point - spread - function ( psf ) varies by so much over this wide spectral range .",
    "our spectral mapping strategy will provide : 1 ) adequate spatial coverage to obtain accurate line ratios over the same physical region in the sources ; 2 ) s / n @xmath57 in the principal diagnostic lines ( below ) ; 3 ) flexible scheduling and roll angle .",
    "high - resolution observations with the irs spectrograph are covered in two echelle modes , a  short - high \" mode at 1019.5  and a  long - high \" mode at 19.337 .",
    "our short - high spectral maps will cover a total area of 157@xmath42236 , while the long - high maps cover an area of 335@xmath42448 .",
    "the larger area in the long - high observation is necessitated by the larger psf at the longer wavelengths .",
    "our basic unit of coverage for the nuclei and hii regions is well - matched to the area covered by the short - high slit .",
    "we expect to achieve 1  @xmath17 noise levels for unresolved emission lines of approximately @xmath60  w  m@xmath38 in the short - high and long - high data , except for the region beyond about 32 @xmath11 m  which may be a factor of 24 noisier .",
    "thus , emission lines at the @xmath61  w  m@xmath38 level , similar to what we expect for [ neii ] and [ siii ] , should be detected at s / n @xmath59 510 over the entire mapped area .",
    "higher s / n is expected in the centers of the mapped regions , where we benefit from aperture oversampling .",
    "the total sings observing program is 512 hr , divided roughly equally between irac and mips imaging , irs and mips low - resolution spectral mapping , and the targeted irs spectroscopy ( table  4 ) .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that all of the legacy observing plans will be re - evaluated after the launch and commissioning phase of sirtf , and are subject to revision should there be significant variances in the flight performance of one or more of the instruments .",

    "imaging and spectra of the sings galaxies in the ultraviolet ( 13002800 ) provide an especially powerful complement to infrared data , because this wavelength region directly traces the photospheric emission of the dominant star - forming and dust - heating population in most galaxies .",

    "will have been observed with the chandra x  ray observatory ( with integration times ranging from 2 to 70ksec ) .",
    "we anticipate that more sings targets will be added to the list in the years to come . as part of sings ,",
    "processed x  ray maps for these galaxies will be made available in various energy bands ( both photon and adaptively smoothed images ) .",
    "chandra s arcsecond resolution will be essential for a detailed comparison of the x  ray data with observations obtained at other wavelengths and for isolating point sources from the underlaying diffuse hot gas .",
    "these x - ray point sources ( such as x  ray binaries and supernova remnants ) provide important clues to the heating mechanisms of the ambient medium . in complementary fashion , the multi ",
    "wavelength sings data will be important to constrain the nature of the chandra point sources .",

    "the sings team is also collaborating on proposals to enlarge the subset of galaxies with high - quality chandra maps .",
    "as with all legacy programs , the sirtf observations are completely non - proprietary .",
    "this means that the pipeline - calibrated data , including calibrated single - pointing images ( and rudimentary mosaic images ) and individual spectra will be available to the public immediately .",
    "these data will enable a wide range of scientific investigations in their own right , and provide invaluable samples of flight data for planning of future go observing programs .",
    "a primary scientific output of the sings project will be added - value data products , including high - fidelity image mosaics , enhanced - resolution dithered images , spatially co - aligned multi - band images , one - dimensional spectral extractions , and full 3d spectroscopic data cubes . a typical image or spectroscopic observation of a sings galaxy",
    "is built from 15815 individual sirtf datasets , so these data products will be the primary source of science - grade data for many users .",
    "we also will deliver user versions of tools for extracting source spectral energy distributions from multi - wavelength sets of images and for building and analyzing spectral data cubes from sets of multiple irs pointings .",
    "we will produce and deliver two sets of irac data products : 1 ) image mosaics in native irac resolution ; 2 ) enhanced mosaics .",
    "the first set of images will possess the native resolution of the instrument , which is limited by the pixel size of the irac detectors ( 12 ) .",
    "since this pixel size undersamples the telescope s point spread function at all wavelengths , we plan to construct a second set of mosaic images that are processed using the drizzle technique ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) to reconstruct the point spread function , and thus provide higher spatial resolution images .",
    "the processing and production of the mosaic images will also include a number of other checks and enhancements to the basic calibrated data .",
    "cross - correlation of the individual pointings will be used to derive spatial offsets between subexposures , and check the pointing reconstruction given in the image headers .",

    "asteroids will be detected by combining the time - separated exposures that are being designed for this purpose .",
    "the mips data products will include 24 , 70 , and 160  mosaicked images and a sed strip spectral cube for each of the 75 sings galaxies .",
    "the initial processing will proceed in similar fashion to irac , with a combination of manual checks on data quality followed by a carefully supervised processing of individual observations to create mosaicked images .",
    "the mips image data products will be delivered in two versions .",
    "the first version will encompass the entire area observed at each wavelength . due to the placement of the three focal plane arrays and their different sizes , this will result in different fields - of - view at each wavelength for both photometry and scan mode observations .",
    "the second version will have images which are background - subtracted ( constant value ) , share a common field - of - view , and have been regridded to a common pixel scale .",

    "the resulting data products will be delivered in two versions as well .",
    "the first will consist of two spectral cubes , one for the object ( without background removal ) and one for the nearby background observations",

    "a program for automated mosaicking of mips images ( named mips_enhancer ) is being developed by the mips instrument team in collaboration with the sings team .",
    "the goal is to use the redundancy inherent in the mips observational strategy to remove residual instrumental signatures in the 70 and 160  data .",
    "the program will be continually improved as knowledge of the detector instrumental signatures increases , and a final delivery of mosaicked images and spectra that incorporate our accumulated knowledge to date will be made at the end of the project .",

    "a single spectral cube will be created for each irs sub - slit ( 6 in total ) used in all nuclear , extra - nuclear and radial strip observations .",
    "the cubes are constructed using a flux - conservative algorithm somewhat related to drizzle ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) , but operating in three dimensions on collections of 2d spectral images .",
    "spatial and spectral smoothing , and other error - correlating operations are avoided by mapping pixels from the raw spectra directly to the spectral cube .",
    "individual single - wavelength spatial samples , consisting of tilted `` pseudo - rectangles '' approximately as long as the slit , and with widths equal to the wavelength sampling interval , are tiled on the detector , and clipped against its pixel grid .",
    "the resulting partial pixels are rotated to match the `` sky grid '' of the final cube , both to remove any intrinsic instrumental spectral line tilt , and to reference all observations to a common position angle of the slit on the sky .",
    "samples collected from different spectral orders which overlap in wavelength , and from adjacent spectrograms within the mapping observation set are combined together in the resultant cube .",
    "the entire set of rotated partial pixels is clipped again against the output sky grid , which is constructed with an adjustable pixel spacing defaulting to the native plate scale of the irs module in use ( none of the irs modules is significantly undersampled ) .",
    "the clipped area for each pixel portion is retained , and in this way an area - conserving mapping of spectrogram pixels to cube pixels is built up , and used to construct the final cube .",
