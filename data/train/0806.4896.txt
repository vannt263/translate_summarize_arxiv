    "we have estimated the cross section for exclusive @xmath0 production not far from the threshold .",
    "we have included both gluon induced diffractive mechanism and the pion - pion exchange contributions .",
    "the first was obtained by extrapolating down the cross section in the khoze - martin - ryskin approach with unintegrated gluon distributions from the literature as well as using two - gluon impact factor approach .",
    "a rather large uncertainties are associated with the diffractive component .",
    "the calculation of mec contribution requires introducing extra vertex form factors which are not extremely well constraint .",
    "this is especially important close to the threshold where rather large @xmath165 and @xmath166 are involved .",
    "the cross section for energies close to the threshold is very sensitive to the functional form and parameters of vertex form factor .",
    "therefore a measurement of @xmath0 close to its production threshold could limit the so - called @xmath153 form factors in the region of exchanged four - momenta never tested before .",
    "we predict the dominance of the pion - pion contribution close to the threshold and diffractive component far from the threshold . taking into account rather large uncertainties these predictions",
    "should be taken with some grain of salt .",
    "clearly an experimental program is required to disantagle the reaction mechanism .",
    "disantangling the mechanism of the exclusive @xmath0 production not far from the meson production threshold would require study of the @xmath145 , @xmath146 processes with panda detector at fair and @xmath167 reaction at j - parc . in the case",
    "the gluonic mechanisms are small and the pion exchange mechanism is a dominant process one expects : @xmath168 . on the other hand if the gluonic components dominate over mec components @xmath169 .    therefore a careful studies of different final channels at fair and j - parc could help to shed light on coupling of ( nonperturbative ) gluons to @xmath0 and therefore would give a new hint on its nature .",
    "such studies are not easy at all as in the @xmath159 decay channel one expects a large continuum .",
    "this continuum requires a better theoretical estimate .",
    "a partial wave @xmath159 analysis may be unavoidable in this context .",
    "the two - pion continuum will be studied in our future work .",
    "a smaller continuum may be expected in the @xmath170 or four - pion @xmath0 decay channel .",
    "this requires , however , a good geometrical ( full solid angle ) coverage and high registration efficiencies .",
    "panda detector seems to fullfil these requirements , but planning real experiment requires a dedicated monte carlo simulation of the apparatus .          c. amsler",
