    "first , it is expected that disorders suppress the high - field superconducting phase , as the fflo state is suppressed .",
    "@xcite the artificial superlattice cecoin@xmath0/ybcoin@xmath0 indeed contains substantial disorders .",
    "second , the number of spacer layers @xmath114 may not be large enough to eliminate the coupling between superconducting multilayers .",
    "inter - multilayer coupling is harmful for the pdw state , and thus it should be decreased by increasing the number of spacer layers .",
    "next , we discuss the tricolor superlattice illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . as we have shown in sec .",
    "iiib , the orbital effect is controlled by the spacing between the outermost layers .",
    "thus , the pdw state may be stabilized in a tricolor superlattice by intercalating the spacer layers into the superconducting layers .",
    "then , the spacing of neighboring superconducting layers is multiplied to @xmath115 with @xmath116 being the number of intercalated spacer layers ( green open circles in fig .  [ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "we assume here that the inter - layer spacing between the spacer layer and the superconducting layer is @xmath23 .",
    "a similar situation in the bilayer @xmath89-doped srtio@xmath1  @xcite has been realized , and superconductivity in the bilayer interface laalo@xmath1/srtio@xmath1/laalo@xmath1 has been studied  @xcite .    multiplying",
    "the inter - layer spacing by @xmath117 is equivalent to increasing the in - plane hopping to @xmath118 while keeping the ratio , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath43 .",
    "for instance , we obtain the same results for the binary superlattice with @xmath96 mev and for the tricolor superlattice with @xmath92 mev and @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the pdw state may be stabilized in the tricolor bilayer superlattice .",
    "however , in reality , the inter - layer hopping @xmath27 between the nearest - neighbor superconducting layers is significantly decreased by intercalating a spacer layer .",
    "for instance , we obtain @xmath123 in the presence of a single spacer layer ( @xmath124 ) , where @xmath125 is the hopping integral between the superconducting layer and the spacer layer and @xmath126 is the potential difference between these layers .",
    "therefore , the stability of the pdw state in the tricolor superlattice should be examined by investigating the superconducting state for small @xmath27 .    , @xmath92 mev , @xmath39 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 .",

    ", width=226 ]    we study here the tricolor bilayer superlattice for simplicity .",
    "the in - plane hopping is set to @xmath92 mev by considering the heavy - fermion superlattice . as we discussed above ,",
    "we obtain the same phase diagram as fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] when @xmath122 and @xmath130 . on the other hand , figs .",
    "[ fig10](a ) and 10(b ) show the phase diagram for @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "since the inter - layer josephson coupling decreases with @xmath119 , the uniform states , namely , the bcs and pdw states , are suppressed .",
    "it is shown that the pdw state is stable at high magnetic fields , but the transition temperature of the pdw state is significantly decreased for @xmath132 .",
    "the pdw state will be furthermore suppressed by further decreasing @xmath119 .",
    "thus , it may be hard to realize the pdw state in a tricolor superlattice by intercalating many spacer layers .",
    "it should be noticed that fig .",
    "[ fig10](b ) is similar to the phase diagram of the binary five - layer superlattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we now understand that the reduced transition temperature of the pdw state in the five - layer system is due to the reduced josephson coupling between the outermost layers . in other words ,",
    "the superconducting inner layers play a role of the spacer layers .",
    "indeed , the pdw state is mainly induced by the outermost layers where the superconductivity is protected against the paramagnetic effect by the rsoc .",
    "for example , we obtain the layer - dependent order parameter @xmath133 in the five - layer pdw state .",
    "finally , we discuss the superconductivity in the bilayer @xmath89-doped srtio@xmath1  @xcite and the bilayer interface laalo@xmath1/srtio@xmath1/laalo@xmath1 .  @xcite the fermi velocity estimated for a carrier density @xmath134 @xmath135 on the basis of the three - orbital tight binding model  @xcite is approximately twice as large as that in our model . since the lattice constant along the @xmath23-axis @xmath136 @xmath25 is nearly half of cecoin@xmath0 , the orbital effect in the srtio@xmath1 heterostructures is comparable to our model .",
    "thus , the bilayer system sandwiching three non - superconducting layers may be a platform of the odd - parity pdw state .",
    "then , the inter - layer coupling between superconducting layers may be small , and therefore , the pdw state may appear in the low temperature region , as shown in fig .",
    "the kink in the upper critical field would be a signature of the pdw state .",
    "topologically non - trivial insulators and scs have evolved into one of the major research topics of modern condensed matter physics recently .",
