    "most likely , all these processes together contribute to form the multiple moving groups seen today in the galaxy , but is there one more effective than the others , should we be seeing more groups produced by intrinsic secular processes than the ones produced by disrupted satellites or clusters , or can we identify clearly what phenomenon produces which particular group ?",
    "hopefully soon , these and many other questions will be better answered with the impending arrival of the great new large surveys ( such as gaia , sloan / apogee , the geneva - copenhagen survey , rave , segue , etc . ) joined to the best theoretical tools to elucidate the different processes .    meanwhile , one of the intricate problems to solve today is the detection of these groups .",
    "some of the best known methods to identify moving groups in the literature are those using kinematic diagrams , such as the bottlinger diagram @xcite in the u , v , w space , and color  magnitude ( cm ) diagrams @xcite .",

    "a method based on the lumpiness in integrals of motion has been employed by @xcite to study the merger history of our galaxy . for a review of methods , see this last reference .",
    "previous work has demonstrated the influence of galactic bars on resonant trapping of orbits on the galactic plane and out of it .",
    "for example particles on bar resonances can exchange or transfer angular momentum to particles in the dark matter halo , driving dynamical evolution ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although n - body simulations will probably be the best test - bed models to produce studies like the one presented here , it is still intricate to extract information from resonant particles because of their lack of resolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we employ in this work a very detailed milky - way steady model that is described in section [ sec : model ] .    assuming that a large fraction of moving groups can be explained by intrinsic properties of the milky way galaxy , such as its nonaxisymmetric potential structure , in this work we analyse the trapping of stars by resonances on the galactic plane produced by these nonaxisymmetric components , and our aim in this and in a second paper is to investigate the possible relation of these trapping regions with some known moving groups in our galaxy . for this purpose ,",
    "we have developed a new straightforward tool to analyse the resonant trapping .",
    "the method requires the computation of stellar orbits in a nonaxisymmetric galactic potential , and makes use of diagrams of a ` characteristic ' orbital energy versus a ` characteristic ' orbital angular momentum , or versus the orbital jacobi constant if the galactic potential employs only the bar in its nonaxisymmetric components .    a sample of halo stars and disc stars in the solar neighbourhood is employed to show how the proposed method works . our galactic potential uses mainly the bar as the nonaxisymmetric component , but results are given showing the additional effect of the spiral arms . an axisymmetric potential is also considered , to compare with the main features that arise in the nonaxisymmetric case .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ catalogo ] ,",
    "the observational stellar sample is described . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , the properties of the three - dimensional galactic potential employed to compute orbits are summarised . in section [",
    "sec : method ] the new method and its technique to analyse resonant trapping is introduced .",
    "section [ periodicas ] gives a study of periodic orbits on the galactic plane obtained in a galactic potential including only the bar in its nonaxisymmetric components ; this study gives the orbital support on which the proposed method is based .",
    "section [ zefec ] shows the important influence that resonant families on the galactic plane can have on stellar orbits at different @xmath1-distances from this plane , which is fundamental for the application of the method to stars in the galactic halo . in section [ fourier ]",
    "this method is complemented by presenting the spectral analysis of the galactic orbits of the sample stars and of the computed periodic orbits . in section [ ejemplo ]",
    "the method is applied to the kapteyn moving group in the galactic halo .",
    "finally , section [ concl ] presents our conclusions .",
    "the sample used in this work consists of 1642 halo and disc stars from the catalogues of @xmath2@xmath3 photometry of high - velocity and metal - poor stars observed at the national astronomical observatory , san pedro mrtir , mxico ( hereafter spm ) @xcite with 711 , 553 , 442 , and 143 stars in each of these catalogues , respectively .",
    "however , not all of these stars have complete kinematic data , and some of these stars have been repeated in more than one catalogue , which has been amended in the final data base as explained in @xcite .",
    "also , about half of the stars in the first catalogue @xcite have been observed at the danish telescopes , la silla , chile , ( hereafter ls ) : 36.0% of the stars in this first catalogue were observed exclusively in the north at spm , those with the note ` n ' in their table viii ; 50.1% exclusively in the south at ls , those with ` s ' ; and 13.8% at both observatories , denoted with ` n / s ' .",
    "the coordinates and proper motions employed in this paper have been taken primarily from : hipparcos @xcite , tycho2 @xcite , and the revised nltt @xcite . for a few stars",
    "other sources have been used for the proper motions , such as the original nltt @xcite , the lhs @xcite , the lowell proper motion survey @xcite , and the ppm star catalogue @xcite . in general",
    "the proper - motion errors range from 0.53.0  mas / yr per component for the best sources , such as hipparcos and tycho2 , to as large as @xmath4  mas / yr per component for the other sources .",
    "the median errors of the proper motions are @xmath5 mas / yr for @xmath6 , and @xmath7 mas / yr for @xmath8 .",
    "the distances were derived from the photometric absolute - magnitude calibration of @xcite and @xcite , or from parallaxes in simbad for stars with errors less than 10% or for stars outside the colour range of the photometric calibration .",
    "the median error of these distances is @xmath9 pc , or @xmath109.6% of the distance .",
    "the radial velocities have been selected from the literature , from a number of sources , such as @xcite and nordstrm ( private communication ) .",
    "simbad has been consulted to obtain the most precise and up - to - date values possible ; about 20% of our radial velocities have been updated from our previous study @xcite .",
    "the errors of these radial velocities range from a few tenths of a km s@xmath11 for the best sources ( carney et al .",

    "in order to construct a comprehensive orbital study of stars in ` moving groups ' in the galactic disc and halo , a detailed , observationally restricted , semi - analytic ( i.e. with some of the functions numerically solved ) , three - dimensional model of the milky way galaxy , composed of axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric potentials , is employed @xcite . in this model ,",
    "some modifications are made on the axisymmetric galactic potential of @xcite .",
    "this axisymmetric potential consists of three components : a disc , a spherical bulge , and a massive spherical halo . the first modifications to build the nonaxisymmetric galactic potential consist in that all the mass in the spherical bulge is employed to build the galactic bar , and a small fraction of the total mass of the disc is employed to build the three - dimensional spiral arms .",
    "therefore , only two axisymmetric components are conserved in the final model , the slightly diminished disc and the spherical halo .",
    "a boxy bar is employed to represent the galactic bar ; its model is described in @xcite .",
    "the model for the three - dimensional spiral arms , called perlas , is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the galactic potential has been rescaled to the sun s galactocentric distance , @xmath14 = 8.3 kpc , and the local rotation velocity , @xmath15 = 239 km s@xmath11 , given by @xcite .",
    "a brief description of the observational / theoretical parameters utilised to restrict the nonaxisymmetric components of the model is presented next and summarised in table [ tab : model ] ( further details on the parameters of the model and restrictions were introduced in @xcite ) .      in @xcite three different models for the galactic bar",
    "were introduced , which approximate the density model of @xcite of cobe / dirbe observations of the galactic centre : a prolate , a triaxial and a triaxial boxy bar .",
    "for the computations in this work , we have adopted the triaxial boxy bar model , that fits better the galactic observations .",

    "we consider @xmath19 = 20@xmath20 for the present - day orientation of the major axis of the galactic bar ; this is the angle between this major axis and the sun - galactic centre line .",

    "@xcite concludes from his review that the most likely range in @xmath21 is 50",

    "the value @xmath21 = 55 @xmath22 is employed , as listed in table [ tab : model ] .",
    "this value is consistent with the recent estimate of @xmath21 given by @xcite : @xmath21 = ( 1.89 @xmath10 0.08)@xmath23 , with @xmath23 the local angular velocity ; in our potential this gives @xmath21 = 54.4 @xmath10 2.3 @xmath22 .",
    "the spiral - arm model employed in this work is the one called perlas @xcite ; it is formed by a three - dimensional bisymmetric steady potential consisting of a superposition of inhomogeneous oblate spheroids along a logarithmic spiral locus , adjustable to better represent the available observations of the galactic spiral arms .",
    "this simulates the main galactic spiral arms as in @xcite and @xcite , based on the spitzer / glimpse database .",
    "the position of the spiral arms at the present time is taken as in figure 1 in @xcite , i.e. the line where these arms emerge at the inner galactic region lags behind the major axis of the bar making an angle of 40@xmath20 with this axis .",
    "the specific parameters of the spiral arms , such as angular velocity , pitch angle , etc . , are provided in table [ tab : model ] and more specific details of the parameters are presented in @xcite . the spiral - arm mass is distributed as an exponential decline along the arms , and their strength is related with their total mass , which is a small fraction of the disc mass . to quantify the strength of the arms , the function @xmath24 @xcite is computed .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath24 over the radial extent of the spiral arms , called @xmath25 , is a measure of the strength of the spiral arms . in agreement with @xcite , and considering that for sbc galaxies , as for our galaxy , @xmath25 is approximately less than 0.25 , the corresponding range in total mass for the spiral arms , calculated from perlas model , is obtained with @xmath26 = 0.04@xmath100.01 .",
    "we have taken the central value 3.9 @xmath16 10@xmath27 m@xmath18 for the mass of the spiral arms .",

    "figure [ figura4 ] shows how the diagram in figure [ figura2 ] changes when the spiral arms are included in the nonaxisymmetric potential .",
    "the difference between both diagrams is negligible for the case of halo stars , i.e. , the spiral arms have little effect on halo stars , unlike the bar , where the effect on the formation of groups is clear , most likely due to its much larger mass ( approximately ten times the mass of the spiral arms in the milky way case ) , and also because the perigalacticons of these stars approach close or within the bar region .",

    "the sense of orbital rotation ( of the corresponding orbit in this frame , which in general will not be periodic ) in these left and right boundaries in figure [ figura6 ] is as follows : in the right boundary , i.e. , higher values of @xmath36 , the orbital rotation is @xmath56 ; in the left boundary , toward the region where the disc component distributes , this rotation is @xmath57 . in figures [ fig : famper1 ] to [ fig : famper11 ] a blue starred point on each curve marks the approximate position where the sense of orbital rotation changes in the @xmath0 frame , from retrograde to prograde and vice versa .",

    "an additional property of a given family of periodic orbits , is that a point on its curve in a diagram as in figure [ figura6 ] , i.e. , characteristic energy versus @xmath36 , is not necessarily associated with a single periodic orbit .",
