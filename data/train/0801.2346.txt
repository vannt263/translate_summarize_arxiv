    "computer resources now allow nuclear density functional theory ( dft ) , also called self - consistent mean field theory , to be applied systematically over the entire nuclear chart .",
    "although it is usually applied to ground states , static dft can be extended to treat excitations .",
    "a number of methods to do so have been developed , and it is not yet clear how accurate any of them is and how they compare to one another . in this paper we apply one of the methods , the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) , to calculate the properties of the first excited states in even - even nuclei . we assess strengths and weaknesses of the method for spherical nuclei and compare results with those of two other systematic studies that used different methods .",
    "we have previously carried out qrpa calculations for several isotope chains leading to the neutron drip line @xcite ; the same theory and codes are used here to cover essentially all known lowest - lying states in spherical nuclei .    among the extensions of static dft ,",
    "the qrpa is one of the best justified theoretically .",
    "it is the adiabatic limit of time - dependent dft and as such may be derived from a variational principle .",
    "time - dependent dft preserves dynamical conservation laws , and in the adiabatic approximation is unambiguously defined by the density functional used for the static properties .",
    "its major shortcoming as an approximation to many - body dynamics is that it works reliably only when ground state is nearly a single slater determinant or a bcs - like condensate .",
    "recently , two other systematic calculations of excitations that use very different approximation schemes @xcite have appeared .",
    "both of these studies constrain dft by applying external quadrupole fields .",
    "this allows one to build a multi - configurational wave function or construct a collective potential - energy surface in deformation space .",
    "reference @xcite , using the sly4 energy - density functional @xcite , treats many constrained configurations together to make a discrete - basis hill - wheeler approximation .",
    "reference @xcite , using the gogny interaction @xcite constructs a collective hamiltonian in the 5-dimensional quadrupole - deformation space via the collective potential energy surface and a local treatment of the kinetic energy operator .",
    "we will refer to both as generator - coordinate method ( gcm ) calculations .",
    "in addition to the approximation scheme , the quality of the energy - density functional also affects accuracy ; most functionals are constructed to optimize their static properties . in this study we can not hope to make better functional , but we can at least compare the quality of those that already exist . here",
    "we will test two skyrme functionals , sly4 @xcite , and skm@xmath3 @xcite , both in conjunction with  volume \" pairing interactions .",
    "the results for sly4 can be directly compared to those of ref .",
    "@xcite , which uses the same functional .",
    "we should note that a relativistic functional has already been applied in the qrpa to a subset of the nuclei we examine here @xcite .",
    "our qrpa and underlying hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations assume spherical symmetry and employ a radial mesh with box boundary conditions .",
    "the hfb orbitals are calculated with a code based on the one described in ref .",
    "for the global survey here , we give the box a radius of 16 fm and a radial mesh size of 0.05 fm .",
    "although we can take the ordinary dft functional from mass fits in the literature , the choice of a pairing functional is less clear cut .",
    "we have chosen to treat pairing through an ordinary contact interaction , @xmath4 .",
    "after truncating the space of single - particle orbits ( see below ) , we make an approximate fit of the pairing strength to experimental data .",
    "the quantities compared are the average hfb pairing gap @xcite and the 3-point difference @xmath5 of the experimental binding energies .",
    "the estimated strengths with the sly4 functional are @xmath6 mev @xmath7 for neutrons and @xmath8 mev @xmath7 for protons . functional are @xmath9 mev-@xmath10 for neutrons and @xmath11 mev-@xmath10 for protons . ]",
    "we use the matrix representation of the qrpa in a two - quasiparticle basis , as described in detail in ref .",
    "we represent the hfb eigenfunctions in the canonical basis , and truncate them through limits on the occupation number ( @xmath12 ) or , if the pairing gap is zero , on the single - quasiparticle energy @xcite .",
    "we then construct the usual @xmath13 and @xmath14 matrices @xcite in the truncated two - quasiparticle basis .",
    "the method was applied to the ca , ni , and sn isotopes for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath0 states in ref .  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply the qrpa to many more nuclei than in ref .",
    "@xcite , but only consider the low - lying @xmath0 states . unlike the @xmath15 and @xmath16 excitations , the @xmath0 states are not affected by spurious modes in spherical nuclei ; we can therefore afford to use a smaller space . in our prior work ,",
    "for example , we used a box radius of at least 20 fm . here",
    "we reduce the radius because the lowest @xmath0 states are well localized , even near the drip line . because we do not have to be as careful about translational symmetry",
    ", we reduce the quasiparticle - energy cutoff in the hfb calculation from 200 mev to 50 mev .",
    "finally , we increase the canonical - basis occupation - number cutoff  the smallest occupation number that canonical states included in the qrpa can have  from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , and reduce the single - particle - energy cutoffs ( used when pairing is absent ) from 100 mev to 30 mev . the only way in which we must extend the basis is by increasing the cutoff in the single - particle angular momentum from 21/2 ( in our previous work ) to 25/2 .",
    "the reason is that we are dealing with heavier nuclei here . with all of these limits in place , our largest qrpa matrix , which we encountered in the very heavy nucleus @xmath19th ,",
    "has dimension 6086 .",
    "the space defined by all the cutoffs is large enough so that energies and @xmath20 strengths do not change when we make it larger still . with the space size fixed",
    ", we then determine the strength @xmath21 of the pairing interaction as described above .",
    "our goal is to evaluate the performance of the qrpa in all the spherical nuclei with @xmath22 for which experimental data have been tabulated in ref .",
    "that reference reports 507 nuclei with measured 2@xmath23 excited states .",
    "we select spherical nuclei as follows : we use the hfb code ev8 @xcite to do constrained calculations on a grid of deformations , and drop the cases in which the lowest - energy configuration has nonzero deformation . for the remainder",
    ", we perform unconstrained calculations , starting from deformation values q= 0 and @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "if any of these configurations evolves to a lower energy than the spherical one , we drop the nucleus .",
    "a final requirement for selection is that the qrpa eigenvector correspond to a physical excitation .",
    "thus , we exclude two nuclei in the sly4 data because the eigenvalues are imaginary . other unphysical excitations are eigenvectors whose predominant components correspond to pair addition or removal , rather than excitation of the ground state .",
    "these components are present because the hfb quasiparticle vacuum does not have a well - defined number of particles .",
    "we exclude eigenvectors that have nearly pure two - particle - transfer character , using as a measure an approximate difference in particle number between the ground and excited states : @xmath26 here @xmath12 is a canonical - basis condensate occupation probability , @xmath27 label the quasiparticles in the two - quasiparticle basis , and @xmath28 are the usual qrpa amplitudes . if @xmath29 is large , we select another excitation or drop the nucleus from the table altogether .",
    "the final tables contain 155 spherical nuclei for the sly4 functional and 178 for the skm * functional .",
    "we note that the two tables have 129 out of a possible 155 nuclei in common .",
    "the imperfect overlap indicates that sphericity is not a very robust property of the dft , unlike strong deformation .",

    "the size of the @xmath41 amplitudes is a good measure of softness .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath42-even transition rates due to the added ground state qrpa correlations is given roughly by the softness parameter @xmath43 this expression is designed to reduce to unity in the absence of the @xmath41 amplitudes and have the basic @xmath44 structure characteristic of qrpa transition rates .",

    "the outlying cases are the isotopes of sn ( @xmath48 ) with neutron numbers @xmath49 ( inverted triangles ) . in this case , the sly4 functional predicts the nuclei to be very soft with respect to quadrupole deformation .",
    "in fact , these 3 nuclei have the highest values of the softness parameter in the data set .",
    "we see that theory tends to overpredict the excitation energy , but the error is systematic and the overall distribution is strongly peaked . to summarize performance in a single number ,",
    "we can use the average @xmath53 for the data set . for spherical sly4 nuclei , @xmath54 , corresponding to a calculated energy about 40% higher than the experimental value .",
