    "the oscillations of neutrinos have been confirmed by a number of experiments.@xcite the usual interpretation of this fact within standard quantum mechanics implies that the quantities @xmath4 must be non - zero , thus the neutrinos ( with the possible exception of the lightest one ) must be massive .",
    "this calls for need of extending the standard model of particles and interactions ( sm ) , in which neutrinos are assumed to be massless .",
    "neutrinos reveal also one more characteristic feature , namely , the particles that take part in weak interactions , like the @xmath5 decay , are not the same particles that propagate through space . in another words ,",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 neutrinos , which are produced in weak processes are said to be in the interaction ( or flavor ) basis , while neutrinos that propagate ( eg . from the sun to earth , from radioactive source to the detector etc . )",
    "are in the physical basis and are labeled by @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the states @xmath9 , @xmath10 , are mass eigenstates , so that one can speak about their masses @xmath11 .",
    "the weak eigenstates @xmath12 , @xmath13 , are linear combinations of @xmath9 , @xmath14 and do not possess definite masses . the neutrino phenomenological mass matrix in the flavor basis , @xmath15 , is usually written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 in eqs . ( [ mgozdz : nu ] ) and ( [ mgozdz : m ] ) is the unitary pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) neutrino mixing matrix . for massive majorana neutrinos",
    "it can be conveniently parameterized by three mixing angles @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , two majorana cp violating phases @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , and one dirac cp violating phase @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "three mixing angles @xmath27 vary between 0 and @xmath28 .",
    "the cp violating phases vary between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the investigation of neutrino oscillations provides pieces of information about the mixing angles and the differences of masses squared @xmath31 .",
    "it gives us , however , no information about the absolute masses and the possible cp phases , which do not affect the oscillation probabilities . to obtain the absolute values of neutrino masses , one has to look for the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath3),@xcite investigate the end - point of the beta decay spectrum in tritium,@xcite or relay on the rather rough cosmological models of supernova explosions , large scale structure of the universe etc.@xcite the aforementioned @xmath3 process is at present",
    "the only one known , capable of distinguishing between majorana and dirac neutrinos , which makes the searches for @xmath3 particularly important .",
    "another problem , which is not resolved by the oscillation experiments , is the hierarchy of masses . from the differences of masses",
    "squared one can not deduce the actual alignment of @xmath11 . in agreement with the present experimental knowledge",
    "are two scenarios :    the so - called normal hierarchy scenario ( nh ) , which is defined by @xmath32    and the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) , in which @xmath33 is the lightest one , @xmath34    at present we have no hint which of the hierarchies is realized in nature , so both of them have to be considered .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay is a second order process , forbidden in the standard model due to lepton number violation ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "it may occur only if the neutrinos are majorana particles and some mechanism of lepton number violation is introduced .",
    "these conditions are fullfilled by many extensions of the sm , like the @xmath36-parity violating mssm and others .",
    "therefore the @xmath3 process , as the possible source of information about the physics beyond sm , is intensively investigated theoretically and searched for in experiments .",
    "the half - life of @xmath3 is proportional to the so - called effective neutrino mass , which is just the @xmath37 element of the neutrino mass matrix eq .",
    "( [ mgozdz : m ] ) .",
    "it is a common belief that the confirmation of neutrino oscillations gives a strong back - up for the @xmath3 decay .",
    "however , in such discussions one usually forgets about the possible cp phases . in the present paper",
    "we show , that the cp phases may in fact completely suppress the @xmath3 process , while still being in agreement with all the oscillation data .",
    "the best - fit neutrino oscillation parameters may be summarized as follows:@xcite @xmath38 for the angle @xmath19 only the upper bound is known . from exclusion plot obtained from the data of the reactor experiment",
    "chooz@xcite we have @xmath39 with zero being the best - fit value .    the elements of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath40 become now a rather complicated functions of the phases .",
    "let us start with the case , in which we take @xmath41 .",
    "now , directly from eqs .",
    "( [ mgozdz : m ] ) and ( [ mgozdz : u ] ) one can obtain the following expressions : @xmath42 the elements @xmath43 are complex so the physically relevant quantities are @xmath44 .",
    "the strategy now is , that we want to find such combination of the lightest neutrino mass ( @xmath45 in nh and @xmath33 in ih ) and cp phases to obtain @xmath46 . because @xmath47^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 stand for real and imaginary parts , respectively , we are looking for solutions of the set of equations : @xmath50 for each element in the case of nh and ih .",
    "our results are presented in tab .",
    "[ mgozdz : tab1 ] .",
    "as one sees , in the case of nh only the element @xmath37 may be zero , and this situation requires a precisely fine - tuned value of @xmath45 . the corresponding phase @xmath21 is given by the condition @xmath51 .",
    "other elements , of less interest for us , has been calculated as well .",
    "it turned out that it is impossible to find zero solutions for the @xmath52 and @xmath53 elements , while for the remaining ones there are solutions in the case of ih only .",
    "one has to bear in mind , that the lower bounds on @xmath33 come out from our calculations but do not take into account other constraints on neutrino masses .",
    "for example the global astrophysical and cosmological limit on the sum of all three masses @xmath54 is roughly given by 1  ev , which means that @xmath33 can not exceed this value .",
    "notice also that , for obvious reasons , it is impossible to have all diagonal elements being zero at one time .    in the case",
    "in which @xmath55 , the expressions for @xmath56 become very complicated functions.@xcite some of them depend simultaneously on all three phases which makes their analysis nearly impossible , also numerically .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath57 element remains relatively simple : @xmath58 assuming the maximal allowed value @xmath59 one obtains the zero solution for nh and @xmath60 one notices that , as expected , this solution contains the one obtained in the simpler case @xmath61 .",
    "the possible values of @xmath62 are depicted on fig .",
    "[ mgozdz : fig1 ] .",
    "we have shown that the popular practice of neglecting cp phases in the neutrino mass matrix may have severe consequences .",
    "in particular , for certain combination of parameters ( phases and the mass of the lightest neutrino ) , weak processes like the neutrinoless double beta decay may be suppressed . however , the inclusion of cp phases in the calculations is a highly non - linear problem , which may be a big obstacle .",
    "it is thus desirable to find a method of determining the possible cp violation in the neutrino sector experimentally .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the obtained values of @xmath45 which give zero solutions for the @xmath37 element are within the range of experimental and theoretical bounds ( roughly speaking they do not exceed the limit of 1 ev ) .",
