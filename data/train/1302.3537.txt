    "the features of sn  2003du from @xmath10  d to @xmath37  d are similar to the features of sn  2009ig at the same phases , but the hvf diminish more rapidly in sn  2003du .",
    "the most extreme phase offset relative to sn  2009ig is found in sn  2011fe , for which the sequence from @xmath58  d to @xmath12  d corresponds to sn  2009ig from @xmath10  d to @xmath11  d. although the first spectrum of sn  2011fe was obtained earlier than the first spectrum of sn  2009ig with respect to @xmath4-max , the spectrum of sn  2011fe corresponds to a phase in the sequence that is after the detached hvf are observed .",
    "there is only a it is possible that even earlier observations of sn  2011fe could have revealed hvf .",
    "previous authors have studied the eccentricities of the  @xmath76355 line profile in sn  ia without directly detecting hvf .",
    "the presence of a hvf component from  @xmath76355 is inferred from unusual line profiles that are wide , square , or triangular .",
    "none of the spectra available before sn  2009ig display separate and distinct high - velocity  features such as found at @xmath2 and @xmath9  d in sn  2009ig and from @xmath2  d to @xmath43  d in sn  2012fr .",
    "@xcite use synow to model early - time spectra of eight sn  ia .",
    "they show that fitting the  @xmath76355 line profile requires a  detached \"  region at 20,00022,000 km  s@xmath1  for seven of the eight sn  ia .",
    "the other sn in their sample requires a detached region at 24,500 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite compare the early spectra of six sn  ia and report that each of the  @xmath76355 line profiles are well fit by a double - gaussian function with separate central wavelengths .",
    "they show that two separate absorption features can be combined to produce flat - bottomed and triangular line profiles .",
    "figure  [ psi6 ] shows that for different sn  ia the characteristic velocities of the hvf and pvf regions can vary by up to 3,000 km  s@xmath1 , but in all cases a gap of at least 5,000 km  s@xmath1  is maintained between the hvf and pvf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite describe the separation between hvf and pvf components to be about 8,000 km  s@xmath1 , the same value as the velocity gap in sn  2009ig .",
    "the correlation of line profiles from pre - maximum spectra of other sn  ia to the spectral sequence of sn  2009ig confirms a suggestion made by @xcite that the `` peculiar '' profiles of  @xmath76355 in early - time spectra of sn  ia can be explained as part of a common evolutionary sequence that includes separate hvf and pvf components .",
    "@xcite also propose that the strength of the hvf components from  and  lines is correlated in sn  ia .",
    "thus , if one of these lines produces strong hvf , then the other will also have a strong hvf component .",
    "the spectra of sn  2009ig confirm this relationship , and they also demonstrate that the presence of strong hvf from  and  may be an indicator for hvf of , , and .",
    "the agreement between the sn  2009ig results and these well - studied sn  ia demonstrates that the behavior of hvf line forming regions in spectra of sn  2009ig is not unique , and in fact is quite common .",
    "the papers discussed in this section identify fifteen sn  ia with spectra obtained at @xmath12  d or earlier .",
    "all fifteen sn display high - velocity  at velocities between 17,000 and 22,000 km  s@xmath1 , and all but sn  2011fe show evidence for separate hvf and pvf absorption components .",
    "the observations of detached hvf in sn  2009ig suggest the presence of a region at 20,00023,000 km  s@xmath1  in the velocity space of the sn with a localized enhancement of element abundance or density , or both .",
    "the proposed line forming region would be the source of hvf for , , and  from @xmath10  d to @xmath16  d.    this simple model is complicated by the fact that hvf are initially detected at a range of even higher velocities . in addition , the hvf velocities of , , and  decline at different rates .",
    "this suggests that the lines may sample different density structures .",
    "although the velocity ranges overlap , the hvf of each line are not even detected in the same region .",
    "figure  [ area4 ] shows that at @xmath2  d ,  @xmath76355 has the narrowest detached hvf with a velocity range from 10,000 to 30,000 km  s@xmath1 . at the same phase ,",
    "the hvf of  and  hvf extend from 10,000 to 50,000 km  s@xmath1 , but they are offset from each other .",
    "absorptions are exceptionally broad in velocity space , with absorption minima that are several thousand km  s@xmath1  higher than the hvf components of other lines . due to the very low excitation potentials of the  lines ( @xmath59 ev ) , they are capable of producing detectable absorptions at much lower abundances than most other lines found in sn  ia",
    ".  lines also have low excitation potentials ( @xmath60 ev ) . in sn  2009ig ,",
    "the hvf from  are nearly as wide and deep as hvf of , with velocities between  and .",
    "the simplest explanation for both the hvf ca and fe observations is that primordial abundances of these elements are sufficient to produce the observed absorptions .",
    "the line profiles can be produced by light from the sn passing through a line forming region that extends from about 10,000 to 50,000 km  s@xmath1  in velocity space .",
    "the observed minima for these features would move to lower velocities with time , as expansion of the sn reduces opacity at high velocities more rapidly than it does at lower velocities .",
    "as the column depth is reduced , the observed minima become nearly constant at velocities near to the inner edge of the line forming region .",
    "if the hvf of  and  are formed in regions of unburned material from the progenitor , it is still a challenge to explain the simultaneous presence of detached hvf for  @xmath76355 ( 8.1 ev ) and  ( 13.7 ev ) . an explanation is also required for the fact that the hvf velocities for all lines , as measured at the absorption minima , eventually converge near 21,500 km  s@xmath1 . since figure  [ area4 ] shows that the line forming materials are distributed through a wide range of velocities , there must be some motivation for the line opacities of , , , , and  to have approximately equal values at the same phases and in a relatively narrow velocity range .",
    "attempts have been made to explain hvf without invoking a separate line forming region .",
    "the flat - bottomed and triangular shapes observed in the  @xmath76355 line profile at early times receive particular attention .",
    "none of the physical models used to generate unusual line profiles survive comparisons with early observations of multiple sn  ia .",
    "hvf from  have also been attributed to opacity effects from recombination , but the time scale of recombination is a day or two and hvf from  are observed from 8 to 15 days in individual sn  ia .",
    "explosion models for sn  ia make predictions for structures that range from spherical to highly asymmetric .",
    "the resulting chemical distributions may be simply stratified by atomic mass , violently mixed between regions of burned material , or contain bubbles of material moving between burning regions .",
    "model results can be tuned to produce specific layering compositions and velocity distributions that may mimic hvf of specific atoms at specific locations .",
    "we are not aware of any explosion models that predict the relative uniformity across a range of absorbing materials that is observed for hvf in sn  2009ig .",
    "one way to increase the local density in high - velocity regions is by interaction between the expanding ejecta and nearby circumstellar material ( csm ; * ? ? ?",
    "the shock front sweeps up csm and a shell is  locked in \" after the shock moves on",
    ". the shell will continue in homologous expansion with the rest of the sn ejecta .",
    "this model satisfies the constraint that the hvf line forming region exist in a narrow , unchanging velocity window and explains the asymmetric line profiles of the  @xmath7  6355 hvf .",
    "three of the recent models have been able to produce variable density structures : symmetric ignitions that generate strong mixing @xcite , gravitationally confined detonations with burning regions on the surface of the wd @xcite , and double - detonation models that produce a high - velocity burning region with a density gap between it and the center of the sn @xcite .",
    "we present a time series of spectra of sn  2009ig obtained between @xmath14  d and @xmath61  d with respect to the time of @xmath4-max .",
    "the two earliest observations in our sample ( @xmath14  d and @xmath15  d ) are the first spectra of a sn  ia to resolve the high - velocity component of  @xmath76355 as a distinctly separate absorption feature .",
    "hvf are identified in the spectra from , , , , and , and we show that the line profiles require a detached hvf line forming region .",
    "simultaneous detections are made for hvf and pvf of the same lines from @xmath10  d to @xmath16  d. velocity measurements demonstrate that the hvf and pvf line forming regions are separated by @xmath62 km  s@xmath1  as long as hvf are detected . using a mean velocity of 21,500 km  s@xmath1  for the hvf layer and 13,000 km  s@xmath1  for the pvf layer",
    ", we show that @xmath63 .",
    "the initial hvf velocities and the velocity decline rates are different for each line . the fact that the hvf velocities eventually converge suggests the presence of a line forming region in sn  20019ig at velocities between 20,000 and 23,000 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "a comparison of the hvf from , , and  by phase in velocity space shows that hvf from different lines are formed in overlapping but not identical regions .",
    "hvf of  and  have strong features that range from 10,000 to 50,000 km  s@xmath1  in the earliest spectra , but the locations of their absorption minima differ by @xmath56 7,000 km  s@xmath1 . at the same phases ,  hvf",
    "are confined to a much narrower region that extends from 10,000 to only 30,000 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we explore the physical conditions that can produce detached hvf , and find that it is challenging for any model to reproduce the observations of sn  2009ig .",
    "the spectra of sn  2009ig form a complete map of the transition from the earliest observations of detached hvf to features with contributions from both hvf and pvf , and finally to phases when all of the absorptions are pvf .",
    "hvf of both  and  are frequent characteristics of sn  ia observed before @xmath12  d , and that allows us to compare our results to observations of several other sn  ia .",
    "all of the line profiles found in early - time spectra of sn  ia can easily be correlated with individual profiles that are part of the development sequence defined by sn  2009ig .",
