    "xte j0421 + 560 was discovered by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on 31.64 march 1998 @xcite as the first bright x - ray transient in several years , reaching almost 2 crabs within a day of the first detection .",
    "corresponding radio emission was detected soon after ( 1.9 april ; @xcite ) .",
    "optical observations @xcite identified the radio and x - ray transient as the star , based on positional coincidence with the radio emission , and a concurrent optical outburst .",
    "it was also detected by the burst and transient source experiment in the low  energy gamma ",
    "rays , reaching a flux of 1.6mcrab in the 2040 kev band @xcite .    is a peculiar bright emission - line star with unusually strong fe  ii lines @xcite , indicating a very hot star or stellar shell .",
    "it also has a near - ir excess @xcite .  has a rich and unusual optical spectrum and",
    "has been identified as a symbiotic star @xcite , a herbig  be star @xcite , a b[e ] star @xcite , and a supergiant b[e ] ( sgb[e ] ) star @xcite .",
    "the recent consensus seems to be that it is either a b[e ] or sgb[e ] star .",
    "if it is an sgb[e ] star it would be the only one identified in our galaxy , all others having been found in the magellanic clouds .",
    "its distance has been estimated to be anything from 1kpc @xcite to 8kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) based on luminosity , spectrum , interstellar absorption , and kinematics .",
    "here we take 5kpc as a reasonable compromise .  was not previously a known radio source , with two 10.7ghz observations in 1973 giving upper limits of 5mjy @xcite .",
    "s x - ray / radio / optical flare puts it into another class , that of x - ray novae .",
    "if  is at a distance greater than 2kpc then its x - ray luminosity indicates that there is probably a compact object ( black hole or neutron star ) in the system ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggests that the outburst was the result of thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a white dwarf , which would require a closer distance .",
    "even with all the different stellar identifications for the optical source , it is clear that  must be a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) .",
    "s x - ray behavior is unique among x - ray binaries .",
    "for instance , unlike other hmxbs ,  does not have persistent highly variable x - ray emission , and has a soft x - ray excess in quiescence @xcite .",
    "the persistent soft x - ray emission can be attributed to the sgb[e ] star and the heavily absorbed harder emission may be an obscured compact object , but this is not certain , since this type of emission is extremely unusual for x - ray transients @xcite .",
    "the flare itself peaked first in the x - ray , then in the optical , and finally at radio wavelengths @xcite , with several short , soft x - ray flares within ten days of the outburst @xcite , and rapid changes in the x - ray absorption column over the first few days @xcite , as well as years afterwards @xcite .",
    "the radio behavior is fairly typical of x - ray transients , with an optically thick rise followed by an optically thin decay @xcite , but with no sign of further flaring activity .",
    "an initial report of a relativistic radio jet @xcite has since been shown to be an artifact due to a bad calibrator @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a radio imaging study of   from a few days to roughly a year after the x - ray outburst , using the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the united kingdom national facility multi - element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ) .",

    "s radio emission is also , for x - ray novae , unusually long - lived , allowing it to be observed many months after the x - ray flare .",

    "is in fact still detected ( 2004 ) at the @xmath10mjy level with the vla ( rupen , in prep ) .",
    "all the vlba observations were phase referenced to the strong vlbi sources j0419 + 5722 and j0422 + 5324 , while the merlin experiment was only referenced to j0419 + 5722 .",
    "both of these sources are less than @xmath11 away from  and are excellent calibrators . for the vlba observations we used a cycle time of 1 minute on j0419 + 5722 , 2.5 minutes on , then 1 minute on j0422 + 5324 .",
    "the observations were reduced in the standard manner using the nrao s astronomical image processing system @xcite . the second epoch was phase and amplitude self - calibrated , but all other epochs were not . during the epoch the total flux smoothly varied by 10% in the 1.7 and 5.0ghz and 20% in the 15.4ghz data .",
    "the variations were flattened by the amplitude self - calibration and did not affect the structures in the images .",
    "the two june epochs were concatenated and imaged together .",
    "evolves slowly enough that this is valid , and it improved the image considerably . on 1  april the vlba observed the estimated x - ray position , which was off by 11.4arcminutes .  was thus at the @xmath12 power point of the vlba antennas at 1.7ghz , so all flux densities for that date",
    "have been multiplied by 1.7 .",
    "since these observations were phase referenced the relative positions between the high frequency the maps are accurate , although the relative positions of the 1.7ghz maps may differ by up to a few milliarcseconds ( mas ) due to the ionosphere .",
    "also note that in these images 1mas@xmath13au ( @xmath14kpc , with @xmath15 the distance to the source ) .",
    "a careful polarization calibration was not done , however we can say that  is not polarized by more than a few percent in any epoch , probably less than that for the second epoch .",
    "figures  [ april1 ] and [ april5 ] show the images from the first and second epochs . on 1  april  1998 ,",
    "during the radio rise , the source was very faint , and still optically thick at 1.7ghz ( see figure  [ lc ] ) .",
    "the map shows a peak of 2mjy / beam ; the faint extension to the southeast ( figure  [ april1 ] ) is probably a noise spike .",
    "may be slightly resolved ( @xmath16 ) along a position angle of @xmath17 , but this is very close to the position angle of the beam ( @xmath18 ) , and so may not be real . by 5",
    "april the turnover frequency between optically thick and optically thin emission was about 5ghz , and the images ( figure  [ april5 ] ) show a much more complicated structure . at 1.7ghz",
    ", the source is resolved but very smooth , extending @xmath012mas in the north - south direction . at optically thin frequencies , 5 and 15ghz ,",
    "breaks up into several condensations with a `` kidney - shaped '' structure to the south .",
    "there are significant differences between the images made at different frequencies on 5  april 1998 : the 1.7ghz image extends further north than the 5 and 15ghz images would lead one to expect , while the western arm of the structure seen at 5ghz is not present in the 15ghz image . some of these differences could easily be instrumental .",
    "interferometers act as spatial filters , effectively measuring different components in the fourier transform of the image .",
    "the fourier component seen by a single baseline of length @xmath19 corresponds to a spatial frequency of @xmath20 .",
    "thus long baselines measure rapid fluctuations of the sky brightness , while short baselines respond to more gradual changes .",
    "the same physical interferometer , used at two different wavelengths , may respond quite differently to the identical source structure .",
    "high - resolution interferometric images for instance may not recover large - scale structures which contain most of the source flux density : one sees the crests of the waves , but not the ocean on which they rest . for",
    "more information see @xcite or @xcite .    for  on 5  april  1998 ,",
    "the 5ghz vlba image recovers @xmath21 of the integrated flux density as measured by the vla ; while at 15ghz the vlba recovers only @xmath22 of that integrated flux density .",
    "this strongly suggests that at least part of the 5ghz structure which is missing from the 15ghz image has been removed by the more extensive spatial filtering operating at 15ghz . to test this idea",
    "we put the clean component model of the 5ghz data through the @xmath23 ( fourier ) coverage at 15ghz , to simulate what the 5ghz source would look like if observed at 15ghz .",
    "this produces an image with a morphology almost identical to that actually observed at 15ghz ( see figure  [ spec62 ] ) , and with a total flux which is 50% less than the same area in the 5ghz image ( i.e. , not including the western arm ) . in other words , even if its intrinsic structure were identical to that seen in the 5ghz image , the 15ghz image would not show the western arm because of the spatial filtering of the 15ghz observation .",
    "in addition , the observed 15ghz flux density would be low by about 50% , in agreement with the actual observations .",
    "the only notable distinction which remains is a @xmath24mjy spur to the northeast of the main emission in the 5ghz image , which is not seen at 15ghz .",
    "the spectral index of this spur must therefore be somewhat steeper than the @xmath25 ( @xmath8 ) which characterizes the rest of the kidney - shaped structure . for comparison , the overall 5/15ghz spectral index on this date , as measured with the vla ( rupen et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ", is @xmath26 .",
    "is significantly more extended at 1.7ghz than at the higher , optically - thin frequencies on 5  april  1998 .",
    "this is evident in figure  [ april5 ] , but is shown more clearly in the super - resolved 1.7ghz image in figure  [ specind]a , where the clean component model is restored with a @xmath27mas beam .",
    "following the same procedure as above , figure  [ specind]b shows the 1.7ghz model put though the 5ghz @xmath23-coverage .",
    "while the southern , kidney - shaped emission is fairly similar , the northern component is seen only at 1.7ghz , implying a very different spectral index .",
    "quantitatively , the spectral index of the southern , kidney shaped component between 1.7 and 5ghz is @xmath28 , while that of the northern component must be steeper than @xmath29 .",
    "this is most readily interpreted as an opacity gradient across the source , with the northern component being much more optically thin .",
    "images from further vlba observations on 14 - 21 june , 2 july , and 10 september 1998 are displayed in figure  [ later ] .",
    "since  does not evolve rapidly the 14 and 21 june data sets were concatenated , significantly improving the resulting image .",
    "figure  [ merlin ] shows a merlin image from 31  january  1999 .",
    "the crosses in these images indicate the position of the peak of the 1.7ghz image from 5  april  1998 .",
    "several results are obvious from these figures .",
    "first , the source does not bear any resemblance to a relativistic jet .",
    "second ,  has significantly expanded , from @xmath012mas on 5 april 1998 , to at least 350mas in the north - south direction on 31  january  1999 , 306 days after outburst .",
    "third , the expansion is roughly symmetric about the center .",
    "fourth , there is significant emission within the source s outer rim ( shell ) . finally , the shell s appearance changes significantly with time , although the position angle of the major axis is constant . in early april ,",
    "the southern part is the brightest ; by june - july the northern portion is brighter , and the structure looks almost like a double ring . in september 1998",
    "the source seems more nearly elliptical , and an area in the south has brightened from 1.9mjy in june to 2.7mjy in september , measured at the same position angle on the source and approximately the same area .",
    "unfortunately , the merlin resolution is not sufficient to see any morphological details , but the west side is brighter than the east , showing that the source remains asymmetric through at least 31  jan .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the position angle of the slightly resolved component in the first epoch ( @xmath17 ) is comparable to that of the major axis in these later images , suggesting that this position angle was established within a day of the outburst .",
    "the radio emission in  must be primarily synchrotron , from relativistic particles spiraling around strong magnetic fields .",
    "this is based on the high brightness temperatures ( up to a few billion kelvin ) seen in the vlba images , and on the radio spectrum at high frequencies , which follows a steeper power law than allowed for thermal emission .",
    "further , any thermal plasma hot and dense enough to produce the observed radio emission at late times would necessarily produce strong x - ray emission as well , at levels well above what is actually observed @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the peak brightness temperature in these resolved , optically - thick images is well below the canonical @xmath30 brightness temperature limit thought to be typical of other synchrotron sources , such as extragalactic jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) and radio supernovae ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "taking the peak of the 5  april  1998 5ghz image as an example , assuming energy equipartition between relativistic electrons and the magnetic fields , and taking the ratio of proton to electron energies as @xmath31 ( as in local cosmic rays ) , the magnetic field is @xmath32 , the total energy in relativistic particles and fields is @xmath33 , and the synchrotron lifetime at 5ghz is @xmath34 .",
    "the energy of the electrons producing synchrotron radiation at a frequency @xmath35 is then @xmath36 .",
    "these values should be taken as indicative rather than definitive .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that , as usual , the energy in relativistic particles and fields is not an important part of the overall energy budget  the total x - ray emission in the flare for instance was @xmath37 , while the total integrated luminosity was a factor @xmath38 higher @xcite .",
    "the rapid radio decay further shows that synchrotron losses do not dominate the observed radio light curve , another not - unexpected result .      at early times",
    "the radio remnant is optically thick , indicating substantial absorption .",
    "the rapid changes in optical depth show that this absorption is associated with the source itself , rather than some unrelated medium .",
    "there are two main processes which are relevant here : synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) by the same relativistic electrons which produce the emission , and free - free absorption by dense ionized gas along the line - of - sight .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field derived above would produce an ssa cutoff frequency of @xmath39 ; below this frequency the emission should be optically thick , with a characteristic @xmath40 spectrum .",
    "this is consistent with the observed 1.7 and 5ghz flux densities on 5  april  1998 , which imply a turnover frequency around 2.4ghz .",
    "the northern component , seen only at 1.7ghz , could easily be optically thin on the same date , since its much lower flux density yields a predicted ssa turnover below 1ghz . at the same time",
    "the emission from the main , southern region must truly be as smooth as it appears in these images : any significant clumping would lead to brightness temperatures above @xmath41 , corresponding to ssa turnover frequencies above 5ghz .",
    "is also known to have a dense stellar wind , which could lead to substantial free - free absorption . to produce unit opacity at 3ghz",
    "requires an emission measure ( @xmath42 ) of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the electron temperature , @xmath45 is the electron number density , and @xmath46 is the line - of - sight path length . taking an @xmath47 wind , assuming cosmic abundances , and taking the inner radius of the absorbing material to be 10au ( corresponding roughly to the size of the 5  april  1998 emission region ) ,",
    "this gives a density at 10au of @xmath48 .",
    "for comparison the modeled density for the wind in the sgb[e ] star hd87643 at 10 stellar radii is @xmath49g@xmath50 and @xmath51g@xmath50 for the hot diffuse and cold dense winds , respectively @xcite .",
    "free - free absorption could thus be quite significant , depending on the relative orientation of the winds and the radio - emitting region , and on the temperature and ionization of the winds . in sum",
    ", synchrotron self - absorption must be important in the early radio remnant , but free - free absorption may also play a role . a detailed analysis of the multi - frequency radio light curve may break this degeneracy .    even without any absorption",
    ", the radio remnant shows significant spectral variations : the northern component seen at 1.7ghz on 5  april 1998 must for instance have an intrinsic emission spectrum ( @xmath52 or steeper ) which is much steeper than the rest of the source ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "such extreme variations have not been seen in other shell - like sources , such as radio supernovae ( bietenholz et al .",
    ", priv.comm . ) and supernova remnants ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the explanation may lie in the very complex environment around , which could plausibly lead to very different densities and magnetic fields in different parts of the circumstellar medium .",
    "the basic appearance of s radio remnant ( edge - brightened , clumpy , shell - like ) strongly suggests a shock plowing into a dense circumstellar medium .",
    "the radio emission from all other x - ray transients has been either unresolved , or consistent with a highly collimated one- or two - sided jet ; but there is certainly no sign of a jet in these images , and the continued brightness of the remnant despite substantial expansion requires on - going particle acceleration .",
    "the relative brightness of various features changes substantially from epoch to epoch , with some parts of the remnant even brightening despite the overall decay ; but the overall shape remains fairly constant ( see below ) .",
    "the basic implication is that we are seeing the evolving results of an explosion inside a dense , clumpy environment , much like a radio supernova .",
    "the changing appearance then corresponds to changes in the local shock strength , the particle acceleration efficiency , or the synchrotron emissivity ; these in turn are presumably functions of the local particle density and magnetic field strength and orientation .    even in our last image ,",
    "the remnant shock is only @xmath54mas ( @xmath55au ) across , and is thus still running into material dominated by s stellar wind .",
    "the highly asymmetric and clumpy radio morphology probably implies a similarly anisotropic and inhomogeneous circumstellar medium ( csm ) , which seems more likely than a severely asymmetric explosion or magnetic field , and is consistent with other indications of a highly anisotropic wind @xcite .",
    "the idea of a dense surrounding medium is also supported by x - ray observations of  in quiescence , which show strong and highly variable absorption @xcite , and by s strong infrared excess @xcite . in this picture",
    "the changing appearance of the remnant reveals the variations in the density of the csm .",
    "the initial bright kidney shaped structure to the south ( figure  [ april5]b and c ) was presumably due to a particularly dense clump on that side , which has been over - run by the time of the june - july images ( figure  [ later]a and b ) ; while the initially fainter emission to the north indicates a lack of dense material on that side . @xcite and @xcite suggest that the outflow from consists of a slow ( @xmath56 ) , dense equatorial wind , and a fast ( @xmath57 ) , less dense polar wind .",
    "the shock seen in the radio emission between 2july1998 and 10september1998 then traces out 250/8200 years of stellar mass loss , during which time the density of the stellar wind changed from most dense in the north - west to most dense in the south - west ; while the similarity between the june and july maps shows that the wind did not vary dramatically on shorter timescales ( 75/2500 years ) .",
    "significant stellar wind variations are not unprecedented",
    ". optical images of icr+10216 , for instance , reveal discrete incomplete rings of dust , which imply that the mass loss rate of the star changes on a hundred year timescale , and is not spherically symmetric @xcite .    despite these changes in brightness across the source ,",
    "the overall structure is quite similar from epoch to epoch : that is , the brightest regions move outward at the same rate as the dim ones .",
    "this suggests that the radio synchrotron emission simply serves to ` light up ' the edges of the shock , while remaining energetically unimportant . by itself",
    "this is not so surprising , as the luminosities are so low , but this further implies that the particle acceleration , and whatever causes it to vary around the source , is also not dynamically important .",
    "this is a common result for shocks .",
    "the radio remnant of sn1993j , for instance , exhibits changing 3:1 brightness asymmetries around a shell which decelerates but remains highly circular @xcite and the supernova remnant sn1006 has huge brightness asymmetries around a similarly circular rim @xcite .      as with most astronomical imaging ,",
    "these data show a two - dimensional projection of a three - dimensional object .",
    "the radio remnant is clearly elongated , so the intrinsic structure must also be asymmetric , either due to an off - center explosion , or to an asymmetry in the surrounding medium .",
    "one puzzle is that the source retains a similar appearance while slowing down considerably ( see below ) .",
    "several possible geometries , which could explain the overall appearance , are shown in figure  [ scheme ] .",
    "an ellipsoid could explain the outer shape of the remnant , with the brighter regions in the middle caused by some minor asymmetry in the particle acceleration / emission process along the line - of - sight to the center .",
    "however , it is difficult to retain the axis ratio of such an ellipsoid over time .",
    "any three - dimensional structure confined by denser material around the ` waist ' would be expected to become more and more elongated over time , as the material in the waist should decelerate more rapidly than that at the poles .",
    "edge - brightened cone rims could result from a shock lighting the densest regions of a dense wind , as in some planetary nebulae , while a pair of spherical bubbles might arise in an explosion in a highly asymmetric environment .",
    "figure  [ fits ] shows a tilted circular ring and a two - sided tilted cone that were fit to the data ; note that the rims of the cone both move outward and expand with time . in both cases the expansion rate is @xmath58 , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the angle between the normal to the titled ring and the line - of - sight is @xmath59 , while the angle between the cone axis and the line - of - sight is @xmath60 .",
    "these fits are illustrative rather than unique .",
    "the two - sided cone seems to fit marginally better as it takes into account the waist of the nebula .",
    "the results for a pair of spherical bubbles would be similar to those for the two - sided cone .",
    "the expansion rate of  can be fit regardless of the model used to explain the morphology , assuming that the source remains self - similar throughout .",
    "figure  [ exp ] shows the results of fitting an ellipse to each image ; the axis ratio is constant at 1.9:1 , and this plot shows the expansion of the major axis as a function of time .",
    "the shock is clearly decelerating , presumably because of material swept up from the wind as the shock expands .",
    "the average radial expansion rate of the major axis between an assumed explosion date of 31.64 march 1998 ( corresponding to the first x - ray detection ) and 5  april 1998 is @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "this means during the 5  april  1998 observations the source expanded by @xmath63 . since the beam is bigger than this for the 1.7 and 5ghz images this would have no effect .",
    "however @xmath63 is comparable to the 15ghz beam and therefore the motion may have smeared the image slightly in the direction of motion .",
    "this is probably insignificant though , since the structures in this image are @xmath64 .",
    "between the first x - ray detection and the merlin image ( january 1999 ) the _ average _ expansion is @xmath65 @xmath66 .",
    "a power - law gives a reasonable fit to the expansion data : @xmath67 , where @xmath2 is the major axis in mas , @xmath3 is the modified julian date ( mjd ) , and the error bars are @xmath68 assuming normally - distributed errors and forcing @xmath69 .",
    "the implied radial velocity is @xmath70 . while only poorly determined , the explosion date is consistent with the beginning of the x - ray flare ( on mjd 50903.64 ) , and the fit is consistent with  being marginally resolved in the first epoch ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "this expansion rate ( @xmath72 ) is much faster in than the classic sedov phase seen in supernovae remnants ( @xmath73 ) , but is consistent with young supernovae ( e.g. , for sn1993j @xmath74 [ @xcite ] ) .    given the density of s circumstellar medium , the initial impulsive energy injection must have been quite strong to produce such a fast shock .",
    "one quantitative estimate comes from the changing x - ray absorption column seen at early times @xcite .",
    "this implies column densities @xmath75 of a few @xmath76 which decline by more than a factor of ten over the first two days .",
    "it seems reasonable to associate this decline with the forcible removal of material by the shock seen in the radio images . by the time the x - ray absorption has decayed away on 2  april @xcite the shock was @xmath77 @xmath78 across , according to the above fit .",
    "the total number of atoms swept up was @xmath79 @xmath80 , giving an average density of @xmath81 , or @xmath82 , assuming an average mass per atom of 1.4 times the mass of a proton .",
    "these values are well within the range implied by spectroscopy during the outburst ( @xmath83 to @xmath84 : @xcite ) , and not inconsistent with models of the winds in sgb[e ] stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the total mass swept up by the shock was then of order @xmath85 , giving a corresponding kinetic energy ( at @xmath86 ) of @xmath87 .",
    "this number is very uncertain , given all the underlying assumptions . even so it is clear that the kinetic energy in the shock could easily match or exceed the integrated luminosity of the outburst across all observed wavelengths ( @xmath88 , @xcite ) .",
    "the continued slow deceleration of the shock can be used to place constraints on the distribution of the circumstellar material via the shock jump conditions , in a manner analogous to @xcite s treatment of the expansion of radio supernovae .",
    "actually what is derived is a relationship between the density structure of the outer regions of the ejecta , and that of the csm . here",
    "the ` ejecta ' should be thought of as the material swept up by the time of the first observation ; while this is the stellar envelope in the case of a supernova , for  it is probably more appropriate to think of dense material surrounding ( accreting onto ? ) the compact object .",
    "the shock between ejecta with outer density profile @xmath89 and a csm with density profile @xmath90 will expand at a rate @xmath91 , with @xmath92 .",
    "the observed @xmath93 is well within the range observed for radio supernovae ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and suggests @xmath94 for an @xmath95 wind profile . more generally one can argue that the observed deceleration implies that the shock has swept up a significant amount of mass , compared to that of the original ejecta .",
    "the factor two drop in velocity at late times implies a factor two to four increase in the mass over the same interval , assuming momentum or energy conservation , respectively .",
    "data taken before the april 1998 outburst showed a stable spectrum dominated by symmetric , single - peaked hydrogen balmer lines , with wings extending to @xmath96 @xcite . during the outburst both  and  lines became much broader and asymmetric , with line wings extending up to @xmath97 in h@xmath98 and on 3  april  1998 , and perhaps out to @xmath99 in the blue wing of h@xmath98 @xcite .",
    "@xcite also see @xmath100 line wings in h and he on 9  april  1998 . while these broad wings faded fairly quickly @xcite , an ultraviolet spectrum taken two years after the outburst showed p cygni profiles with absorption wings extending to @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "it seems natural to associate these broad lines with the outflow imaged at radio wavelengths .",
    "the proper motions from our images correspond to a radial expansion of the major axis at @xmath102 .",
    "the shock velocity was thus @xmath103 on 3  april , and @xmath104 on 9  april  1998 ; extrapolating to two years after the outburst gives an expected velocity of @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding expansion velocities of the minor axis of the fitted ellipse are 60%  of these values .",
    "there are many uncertainties in comparing the radio proper motions with the optical doppler shifts .",
    "first , the source is clearly asymmetric , both from the radio images and from the optical line shapes at early times , which makes the comparison of radial with transverse velocities somewhat suspect .",
    "second , while the radio emission traces the motions of the outer ejecta , the optical lines could be sampling very different regions , with different kinematics .",
    "this is often seen in supernovae ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and is clearly the case for  at later times , when no substantial line wings are seen .",
    "given the difficulties the rough agreement between optical and radio velocities is remarkable , and suggests that the distance to the source is within a factor two of the nominal 5kpc we have adopted .",
    "there are some similarities between the radio morphology of and the radio outflows / nebulae observed in other stars ( e.g. , ag  pegasi [ @xcite ] and hm  sagittiae [ @xcite ] ) , as well as optical outflows around planetary nebulae ( pne ) @xcite and the high mass star eta  carinae @xcite .",
    "the hourglass and double ring structures seen in many pne is thought to be caused by the density structure of the circumstellar material into which the ejected material expands @xcite ; this is very similar to our picture of s remnant .",
    "however , the optical emission from pne has a very different physical origin from the radio synchrotron seen in , as does the radio emission from most stellar outflows ( thermal free - free radiation ) .",
    "the expansion rate in  is also much larger than the 10km / s to 1000km / s seen in other stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the overall structure of the  radio remnant ( a clumpy shell ) ,",
    "its initial expansion speed ( @xmath106 ) , and its gradual deceleration are all very similar to what is seen in radio supernovae ( e.g. , sn1993j : @xcite ) .",
    "there are however two basic differences .",
    "first , the radio shell in  is decidedly asymmetric , while the few resolved radio supernovae are basically circular .",
    "supernova remnants on the other hand are often asymmetric , which ( as in ) is most readily interpreted as the result of a shock running into a severely anisotropic medium .",
    "second , while radio supernovae  and indeed , virtually all resolved , optically - thin radio sources  have rather steep radio spectra ( @xmath107 to @xmath29 ) ,  retains a much flatter @xmath108 for many months .",
    "since the optically - thin spectral index is a direct consequence of the energy distribution of the relativistic electrons , this requires a very unusual ( but also quite stable ) particle acceleration process .      while radio emission is often associated with x - ray transients and binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "is unique in showing a slowly - expanding , two - dimensional remnant . in all other cases ,",
    "any resolved radio emission is dominated either by separable ejecta , or by a collimated jet , often moving at relativistic speeds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this has led to the wide - spread assumption that radio emission from x - ray binaries always indicates the presence of a relativistic jet , and many models now take radio emission as the best unambiguous tracer of jet emission ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".  throws this entire paradigm into doubt .",
    "does this have wider implications for x - ray binaries in general ? or is  truly unique ?",
    "one possibility is that  did indeed produce a fast jet , but this jet was quickly smothered by the dense surrounding material . in this model",
    "the energy in the jet was converted into a less directed outflow , which we see as a shock moving out into the csm .",
    "this is similar to the failed - jet model for supernova explosions in collapsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "quantitatively , one expects a relativistic jet to slow catastrophically when it has swept up an equivalent rest mass energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the energy in the jet , and @xmath111 is the average density within the radius @xmath112 at which the jet slows catastrophically .",
    "this equation is appropriate to a jet which is stopped quickly enough that lateral expansion can rapidly isotropize the energy . for , we know that the remnant is far from jet - like by a radius of 6mas ( @xmath113 ) , and according to the arguments in  [ sec : exp ] the energy in the shock ( in this model derived entirely from the original jets )",
    "is of order @xmath87 .",
    "this gives a lower limit to the mean density required to stop the jets of @xmath114 , well within the plausible range for the wind of a sgb[e ] star .",
    "it is interesting to note that simulations of `` stalled '' jets in the context of @xmath6-ray bursts predict morphologies very similar to what we see in ( see particularly the @xmath115-inclination images in figures 8 and 9 of @xcite ) .    the question arises as to why other jets are not similarly smothered .",
    "most other x - ray transients live in relatively pristine environments , where the jet might more easily escape . in binaries with substantial circumstellar material",
    "the accretion tends to be more continuous ( e.g. , cyg x@xmath1163 and ss433 ) , and the resulting jets are also ` on ' more often , and are thus perhaps capable of sweeping away the csm .",
    "this fits in with @xcite s picture of the  outburst , in which a compact object in a highly eccentric long - period ( @xmath117 ) orbit moves through the dense equatorial wind of its companion star ; the brief period of super - critical accretion , when the compact object is close to the companion , leads to the x - ray flare and the expanding radio shock front .",
    "a long - period orbit is required to explain the lack of previous known flares , which would have been obvious in the optical to historical astronomers .      given that s radio remnant is clearly dominated by a shock , it is natural to ask whether the emission at other wavelengths could also be associated with that shock , rather than with the accretion disk .",
    "extrapolation of the radio synchrotron spectrum to other wavelengths shows that the expected synchrotron emission is far below that observed during the outburst @xcite .",
    "similarly the thermal emission produced by the shock is likely to be quite modest , for three reasons .",
    "first , the shock has not had enough time to become radiative , for any reasonable densities .",
    "second , the characteristic temperature of the forward shock ( @xmath118 for a 10,000km / s shock ) ( a )  lies outside the passband of most available instruments , and ( b )  puts the shocked gas in a regime where cooling is quite slow .",
    "third , while the reverse shock should be slower and hence lead to lower and more easily observable temperatures , the resulting fluxes are likely to be very low ; scaling from the radio / x - ray ratios in observed supernovae for instance ( e.g. , @xcite ) the expected emission is orders of magnitude below the observed flux during the outburst .",
    "the observed soft x - rays , in this as in other x - ray transients , probably arise in and around the accretion disk rather than in the shock .",
    "thus the only obvious signatures of the shock outside the radio remnant are the optical and uv spectral lines .",
    "some of these are doppler broadened by a thousand or more km / s ; others evolve very rapidly , requiring very high densities , as might result from a shock @xcite .",
    "recent spectra ( 2001 - 2002 ) still show many spectral lines at very different strengths than their very stable pre - outburst levels @xcite , which suggests some continued disturbance around the binary .",
    "none of these is really a ` smoking gun , ' indicating that , for an unresolved x - ray transient , a shock and a freely expanding jet may not be distinguishable",
    ".    it does not however seem likely that the radio emission from many other unresolved x - ray binaries can be fully explained by shocks similar to that seen here .",
    "s radio light curve is unusual in showing a single outburst followed by a smooth , steep - spectrum ( @xmath119 ) decay .",
    "outbursts from other sources often lead to multiple radio events , suggesting strong on - going activity more readily associated with the central source than with a single expanding shock wave . there could be a series of shocks of course , but that requires re - furbishing the surrounding medium on rather fast timescales ( days to weeks ) .",
    "on the other hand , this single shock evacuating the surrounding medium may explain why there was only one explosive event , i.e. , the shock got rid of any additional material that could have been accreted by the compact object , and the compact object moved away from the high density region before the stellar wind could replenish the material .",
    "the quasi - steady radio emission seen in the low / hard state is also very different from s optically - thin remnant , and requires a very small and continuously replenished radio source . given these indications of very different power sources , it is quite surprising that  lies nicely on the loose x - ray / radio correlation found for x - ray binaries @xcite , with a scatter typical of other x - ray transients .",
    "it is far from obvious why direct synchrotron emission from jets should have the same efficiency as particle acceleration in an expanding shock .",
    "we have presented evidence that the radio remnant of s 1998 outburst takes the form of a clumpy , decelerating shell , strongly suggesting an expanding shock front , rather than the relativistic jets seen in many other x - ray transients .",
    "we suggest that the reason for this distinction lies in s very dense stellar wind , which could easily convert even quite energetic jets to a quasi - spherical outflow .",
    "the very broad spectral lines seen in optical emission early on , and in the ultraviolet several months later , seem to be the only other unambiguous signatures of this outflow .",
    "associating the radio outflow with those doppler shifts suggests that the adopted distance of 5kpc is probably good to a factor of two . assuming the changing x - ray absorption at early times is due to circumstellar material removed from the line - of - sight by the radio shock",
    ", we estimate the shock energy as @xmath87 , comparable to the total integrated luminosity of the outburst .",
    "if the smothered jet model is correct , this represents one of the very few measurements of a jet s total kinetic energy .",
    "the relativistic jets seen in other x - ray binaries and transients must either be much more powerful , or be expanding through much less dense material .",
    "the radio light curves of most unresolved sources suggest continued emission from a small region , so it also seems unlikely that extended shocks dominate the radio emission for these sources",
    ".  seems to be related to other x - ray transients , as collapsar supernovae are related to @xmath6-ray bursts .",
    "this paper would not have existed without robert hjellming , who provided the drive to observe this source with the vlba even before we knew it was a strong radio source .",
    "he also edited the first 40 days of the gbi data .",
