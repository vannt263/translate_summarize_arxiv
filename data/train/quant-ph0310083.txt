    "<S> the scheme has the feature of being projective , noiseless , and switchable . </S>",
    "<S> this method is illustrated on the superconducting persistent - current qubit , but can be applied to the measurement of a wide variety of solid - state qubits , the * direct * detection of the electromagnetic signals of which gives poor resolution of the qubit states .    </S>",
    "<S> = -10 mm    quantum computation in solid - state systems is a growing field . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite among various physical realizations , solid - state qubits have the advantage of being scalable to large number of qubits and that the quantum states can be engineered by various techniques . </S>",
    "<S> successful implementations of qubits have been achieved in several mesoscopic systems.@xcite    effective measurement of quantum bits is a crucial step in quantum computing . </S>",
    "<S> an ideal measurement of the qubit is a projective measurement@xcite that correlates each state of the quantum bit with a macroscopically resolvable state . in practice , it is often hard to design an experiment that can both projectively measure a solid - state qubit effectively and meanwhile does * not * couple environmental noise to the qubit . often in solid - state systems , </S>",
    "<S> the detector is fabricated onto the same chip as the qubit and couples with qubit all the time . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , noise should not be introduced to the qubit via the coupling with the detector . </S>",
    "<S> this requires that the detector is a quantum system well - isolated from the environment . on the other hand , to correlate the qubit states to macroscopically resolvable states of the detector , the detector should behave as classical system that has strong interaction with the environment , and at the same time interacts with the qubit strongly . </S>",
    "<S> these two aspects contradict each other , hence measurements on solid - state quantum bits are often limited by the trade - off between these two aspects . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the first experiment on the superconducting persistent - current qubit ( pc - qubit)@xcite , the detector is an under - damped dc squid that is well - isolated from the environment and behaves quantum mechanically . </S>",
    "<S> the detected quantity of the qubit  the self - induced flux , is small compared with the width of the detector s wave packet . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the detector has very bad resolution on the qubit states . </S>",
    "<S> this is one of the major problems in the study of the flux - based persistent - current qubits . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    various attempts have been made to solve the measurement problem @xcite and to provide proposals for scalable quantum computer with superconducting qubits@xcite . in a recent experiment on the flux qubit , the measurement efficiency has been greatly improved by optimizing the bias current and coherence oscillation has been observed@xcite . in this paper , we present a new scheme that effectively measures the pc - qubit by an on - chip detector in a `` single - shot '' measurement and does * not * induce extra noise to the qubit until the measurement is switched on . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to make a switchable measurement ( but a fixed detector ) that only induces decoherence during the measurement . during regular qubit operation , although the qubit and the detector are coupled , the detector stays in its ground state and only induces an overall random phase to the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement process is then switched on by resonant microwave pulses . </S>",
    "<S> first we maximally entangle the qubit coherently to a supplementary quantum system </S>",
    "<S> . then we measure the supplementary system to obtain the qubit s information . </S>",
    "<S> this approach of exploiting conditional resonant transitions for signal amplifying is different from other approaches .    in the following discussion , we illustrate this method by applying it to the measurement of the superconducting persistent - current qubit ( pc - qubit ) . in the previous experiment@xcite , the qubit is inductively coupled to the detector  a dc squid . </S>",
    "<S> the flux of the qubit affects the critical current of the squid by an offset @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the flux in the squid loop in units of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this offset is recorded by measuring the switching current distribution of the dc squid , the average of which is offset by @xmath3 as well . due to quantum fluctuation and thermal activation </S>",
    "<S> , the switching current distribution has a finite width that is much larger than @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the two qubit states result in two switching histograms whose separation is much narrower than the width of the histogram . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the histogram is not perfectly correlated with the qubit states and the measurement has to be repeated many times ( @xmath5 times ) to derive the information of the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this problem can be overcome with our method by using an rf squid to be the supplementary system . </S>",
    "<S> our method is not only closely related to the ongoing experiments of the pc - qubit , but also brings a new idea for effectively measuring solid - state qubits with a resonant pulse technique .    </S>",
    "<S> one might worry that coupling the qubit to an rf squid brings to the qubit a new source of noise that couples directly to the rf squid . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our scheme , until the measurement , the coupling between the qubit and the rf squid nearly commutes with the hamiltonian of the rf squid , and the rf squid stays in its ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the rf squid behaves as a poor transmitter of the noise and can not transfer noise to the qubit as we show below . during the entanglement pulse , the rf squid induces decoherence to the qubit in @xmath6 which is much longer than the @xmath7 duration of the entanglement pulse .    </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting persistent - current qubit@xcite is a superconducting loop that has three josephson junctions in series , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure_1 ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit is controlled by the magnetic flux @xmath8 in the loop , where @xmath9 is the flux quantum . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit states of this circuit are nearly localized flux states with opposite circulating currents . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit states are analogous to the states of a @xmath10 spin and is described by the @xmath11 algebra of the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit hamiltonian can be written as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the coherent tunneling between the two localized flux states over potential energy barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the operator for the circulating current is @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> typically , the circulating current of the qubit is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the critical current of the josephson junctions and @xmath18 . with a loop inductance of @xmath19 , the self - induced flux of the qubit is @xmath20 .    to understand what prevents the effective measurement of the pc - qubit in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we analyzed the previous measurement in detail in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering the dc squid as coupled oscillators . the direct coupling between the qubit and the dc squid offsets the origin of the squid oscillator by @xmath21 with typical experimental parameters , where @xmath22 is the mutual inductance between the two circuits . </S>",
    "<S> the overlapping between the shifted oscillator ground states is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the width of the ground state wave packet of the inner oscillator of the squid . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the qubit becomes the detection and the resolution of the overlapping and highly non - orthogonal oscillator states @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the overlapping of the oscillator states limits the efficiency of the previous measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> assume the qubit state is @xmath26 . with the inductive coupling </S>",
    "<S> , the density matrix of the dc squid ( in the previously used method of @xcite ) quickly relaxes to a mixed state of @xmath25 , @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> let the desired measurement accuracy be @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the square root error from the expected value of the measured variable and @xmath30 is the range of the variable @xmath31 . for a von neumann measurement , within @xmath32 measurements , the average time we find @xmath33 is @xmath34 with the deviation @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 repetitions are required to achieve the accuracy @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> for a measurement with overlapping distributions as in the previous discussions , assume each distribution is a gaussian for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> the average of the gaussian functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are slightly different , but much smaller than @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the deviation of the gaussian distributions . given the qubit state , the average of the measured @xmath42 s is @xmath43 , from which we can infer @xmath44 of the qubit state . with a finite number of measurements , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 is described by a gaussian distribution according to the central limit theorem with an average @xmath46 and a deviation @xmath47 ( @xmath32 measurements ) . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy with @xmath32 measurements is @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 repetitions are required to achieve the accuracy @xmath37 . in the previous experiment , @xmath50 , so @xmath51 is required to get satisfactory results .    </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the measurement in @xcite is not an efficient measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum nature of the dc squid ( which is intentionally designed to reduce decoherence ) prevents efficient detection of the qubit s information . to get a more efficient measurement </S>",
    "<S> , we should either encode information in the pc - qubit in some other way or measure the qubit states with another approach .    given the hamiltonian of a qubit , a projective measurement that correlates the eigenstates to distinct macroscopic states </S>",
    "<S> can always be constructed according to neumark s theorem@xcite . however , in experiments , it is not obvious that we can build a measurement apparatus that effectively measures the pc - qubit without introducing extra noise . in the following , we present a new measurement scheme that improves the previous measurement significantly and is both effective and noiseless .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea is that instead of directly detecting the flux of the qubit , we first apply a short microwave pulse to entangle the qubit with a supplementary quantum system that behaves as an effective two - level system ( etls ) . the flux or charge of the etls </S>",
    "<S> is designed to be much larger than that of the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> then the etls whose state exactly reflects the qubit state is measured . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme is a highly effective `` single - shot '' measurement , and meanwhile it avoids transferring extra noise from the detector to the qubit .    </S>",
    "<S> let the pc - qubit interact with this supplementary system via inductive interaction @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the supplementary system is also a current loop with @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the pauli matrix of the etls . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the energy splitting of the etls , and @xmath57 is the inductive interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we design the tunneling @xmath58 to be adjustable . during qubit operation , @xmath59 ; during measurement , @xmath58 is a resonant pulse that flips the etls . </S>",
    "<S> the energy levels are shown in fig.[figure_1 ] ( c ) .    during regular computation , we store the supplementary system in its ground state @xmath60 . due to the interaction the qubit s energy </S>",
    "<S> is modified as @xmath61 and the qubit states are @xmath62^t$ ] and @xmath63^t$ ] with @xmath64 . by applying an external oscillation with this frequency , </S>",
    "<S> single - qubit gates are achieved . in this process </S>",
    "<S> , the etls stays in its ground state and has trivial dynamics . </S>",

    "<S> , the etls is flipped to the state @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath74 , off - resonant transition between the states @xmath75 and @xmath76 is negligible and the dynamics only depends on the resonance properties . </S>",
    "<S> after a @xmath77 pulse that operates as @xmath78 , the etls is maximally entangled with the qubit : @xmath79 , which gives the density matrix of the etls as :    @xmath80 + ( ic_0^*c_1\\langle 0_q\\vert\\bar{1}_q\\rangle\\vert 1_a\\rangle\\langle 0_a\\vert + c.c . ) \\\\ [ 2 mm ] \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the probabilities @xmath82 of the etls are then measured by a detector . </S>",
    "<S> note that the supplementary system does not have to be a qubit and be well isolated from the environment itself . </S>",
    "<S> but it is required that the noise is not transferred back to the qubit during regular qubit operations .    in this design , </S>",
    "<S> we choose an rf squid to be the supplementary system that inductively couples with the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the circuit is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure_1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the detector is a damped dc squid magnetometer . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the parameters in @xcite for the rf squid , where coherent manipulation of the rf squid has been achieved experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> typical numbers are : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the inductance of the rf squid is much larger than that of the qubit , which has two consequences : 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the flux difference between the states localized in the two potential wells of the rf squid is of an order of half a flux quantum and can be resolved by a dc squid magnetometer in a `` single - shot '' detection ; 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between the rf squid and the environmental noise is strong , hence it is harder to keep the coherence of the rf squid and to use the rf squid as a qubit directly . at @xmath87 , </S>",
    "<S> the rf squid has a double - well potential with several eigenstates localized in each well . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> the junction is always made of a squid where @xmath88 is controllable by external flux @xmath89 and hence is @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the potential energy of the rf squid is drawn in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure_1](b ) with the energies of its eigenstates . by adjusting the parameters , two states localized in different wells and indicated by the up and down arrows in fig .  [ figure_1](b ) are chosen as the effective two - level system . </S>",

    "<S> the states are drawn in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure_1 ] ( c ) with their energies labeled beside each level .    </S>",
    "<S> the rf squid is stored in the state @xmath60 as in fig.1 of @xcite by suddenly switching the flux in the loop . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit energy is @xmath97 and single - qubit operation is implemented with microwave pulse at resonant frequency . during qubit operations , </S>",
    "<S> the rf squid has trivial dynamics . in the beginning of a measurement , a microwave pulse with frequency @xmath98 is applied to the rf squid for a @xmath77 rotation . </S>",
    "<S> this pulse flips the squid state when the qubit is in @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> when the qubit is in state @xmath100 , @xmath101 and the applied pulse is not in resonant with rf squid . by controlling the external flux </S>",
    "<S> @xmath89 , a @xmath77 pulse of @xmath7 ( @xmath102 ) flips the rf squid . </S>",
    "<S> the off - resonant transition has probability @xmath103 which is lower than @xmath104 and is irrelevant in this process . </S>",
    "<S> the operation is hence an effective controlled - not ( cnot ) gate on the rf squid . after the entanglement pulse , the rf squid is measured by a magnetometer , such as the dc squid in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure_1 ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> optimized designs besides the simple dc squid configuration can be made for better detection.@xcite    in designing the rf squid , attention should be paid to several issues to successfully implement this measurement scheme . </S>",
    "<S> first , the two - level system should be well separated from other states of the rf squid so that no off - resonant leakage to other levels happens during the entanglement pulse . in our design , </S>",
    "<S> the two states are at least @xmath105 away from all the other states and off - resonant transitions can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> second , a trivial but crucial point , the parameters have to be realistic for sample fabrication . </S>",
    "<S> we base our scheme on existing experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although we chose as an example to couple the qubit inductively to an rf squid in this paper , other supplementary systems can also be used with different interaction mechanisms and different detection technologies .    with the self - generated flux of an order of one flux quantum , </S>",
    "<S> the rf squid is subjected to strong perturbation from the environment , such as randomly trapped flux , impurity spins and nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , however , the noise does not affect the qubit during regular qubit operations . </S>",
    "<S> the flux - like noise adds to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ qubit_etls ] a term @xmath106 which shakes the energy levels of the rf squid up and down randomly . as </S>",
    "<S> the etls stays in its ground state @xmath60 during the qubit operations , this term only contributes an overall phase to the total wave function of the interacting system and does not decohere the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this is true even when the qubit hamiltonian has a nonzero @xmath107 term . for environmental degrees that assume @xmath108 coupling with the rf squid , </S>",
    "<S> the environmental modes with the frequency around @xmath109 can flip the rf squid in principle . </S>",
    "<S> but at the low temperature of @xmath110 , no excitations of these transversal modes exist to excite the rf squid from the ground state to the excited state .    during the entanglement pulse , </S>",
    "<S> the rf squid makes a transition from @xmath60 to @xmath65 , and the flux - like noise affects the dynamics of the qubit - etls system . </S>",
    "<S> it is important for the gate time to be shorter than the decoherence time of the rf squid to maximally entangle the qubit and the etls . in the rotating frame of the hamiltonian @xmath111 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ qubit_etls ] , the hamiltonian during the entanglement is    @xmath112    the first term is the resonant pulse , and the second term is the flux noise to the rf squid which dephases the rf squid . the noise is treated as a classical fluctuation field @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> the decoherence rate is determined by the spectral density @xmath114 . with noise coupling as in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the decoherence time to be between @xmath115 to @xmath116 which is significantly longer than the resonant pulse of @xmath7 .    in conclusion , we presented an effective measurement scheme that increases the measurement efficiency without introducing extra decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrated this method by applying it to the superconducting persistent - current qubit where a supplementary two - level system  an rf squid  was coupled to the persistent - current qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this method improves the previous measurement by avoiding the difficulty of measuring a flux of @xmath117 flux quantum with a quantum detector whose quantum broadening is of @xmath115 flux quantum . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme creates for the solid - state qubits a new measurement scheme that is projective , noiseless and switchable . </S>",
    "<S> more delicate designs based on this idea can be developed to optimize the measurement . </S>"
