    "the history of the `` prediscovery '' of charmed and top quarks through the loop amplitudes may be repeated in the scalar sector .",
    "on the other hand , if this enhancement in @xmath5 disappears with a larger integrated luminosity , it will still constrain the parameter space of various extensions of the sm containing new charged states which should affect this loop amplitude . in this spirit",
    "there is a number of theoretical attempts to match the indicated discrepancy by the effects of an extended higgs sector @xcite .",
    "notable , the @xmath0 decay rate is sensitive on the doubly charged scalar fields such as those existing in higgs triplet model of neutrino mass generation .",
    "these states have been in focus of both the direct searches at the lhc  @xcite and of theoretical investigations  @xcite .",
    "here we go a step further by studying the effects of singly and doubly charged components of a scalar quadruplet contained in our recent tev - scale seesaw model for neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the tev - scale seesaw model at hand .",
    "a detailed study of the scalar potential is presented in section 3 .",
    "we investigate the effects of exotic scalars on the loop - level higgs decays in sections 4 and 5 . possible direct bounds on exotic scalars are discussed in section 6 .",
    "the conclusion is presented in section 7 .",
    "a simple and predictive tev - scale seesaw model  @xcite under consideration belongs to a class of beyond dimension - five seesaw models  @xcite which , on account of introducing higher iso - multiplets , lower the originally high seesaw scale to the tev scale accessible at the lhc . in order to produce the seesaw diagram in the simple model at hand ,",
    "the fermionic hypercharge - zero quintuplets @xmath6 transforming as @xmath7 under the sm gauge group have to be accompanied by a scalar quadruplet @xmath8 transforming as @xmath9 .",
    "the gauge invariant and renormalizable lagrangian involving these new fields reads @xmath10 where the scalar potential contains the mass and the quartic terms for the doublet @xmath11 and the quadruplet @xmath12 fields @xmath13 in the tensor notation the terms in eqs .",

    "let us remind  @xcite that in the regime of comparable and light ( @xmath18 200 gev ) masses for exotic fermions and scalars the tree contribution prevails , while the loop contribution dominates for heavy masses ( @xmath18 500 gev ) and remains a sole contribution if additional discrete @xmath19 symmetry forbids the @xmath16 term in eq .",
    "( [ scalarpot ] ) .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) the neutral components of the scalar fields acquire a vacuum expectation value and read @xmath20 if all couplings in the scalar potential are real the conditions for the minimum of the potential @xmath21 give @xmath22 the electroweak @xmath23 parameter is changed by @xmath24 from the unit value to @xmath25 constraining the ratio @xmath26 to be smaller then 0.015 .",
    "the mixing between singly charged and between neutral components of @xmath11 and @xmath12 multiplets will occur after the ewsb .",
    "let us illustrate this on the @xmath27 mass terms @xmath28 the mass term that mixes @xmath29 and @xmath30 is small because it is proportional either to @xmath24 from @xmath31 terms in eq .",
    "( [ scalarpot ] ) , or to small lepton number violating couplings @xmath32 dictated to be small from considerations of neutrino masses .",
    "therefore we neglect the mixing between the components of @xmath11 and @xmath12 multiplets and we neglect the terms of higher order in @xmath26 whenever possible .    in the approximations given above , the masses of charged components of the quadruplet @xmath12 are @xmath33 their couplings to the higgs boson relevant for the @xmath0 decay are @xmath34 where the newly introduced couplings @xmath35 are expressed in terms of the quartic couplings @xmath36 and @xmath37 which , for simplicity , we assume to be equal in the following .",
    "in our model in addition to the dominant sm contributions from the @xmath38 boson and top quark loops to the @xmath0 decay rate only the charged scalars contribute substantially .",
    "our exotic scalars are colorless so that the higgs boson production through gluon fusion at the lhc is unaffected . also , since the higgs boson total decay width is only marginally affected , a dominant change in @xmath0 event rate comes from the change in higgs boson diphoton partial decay width .",
    "the analytic expression for the diphoton @xmath0 partial width reads  @xcite @xmath39 where the three contributions corresponding to @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) refer to spin-1 ( @xmath38 boson ) , spin-1/2 ( top quark ) and charged spin-0 particles in the loop .",

    "the measurement of the @xmath0 rare decay mode may mark a spectacular onset of a virtual physics at the lhc .",
    "the interaction with virtual particles is essential both for the production and the decay factor in eq .",
    "( [ expt ] ) .",
    "it is in order to discuss the features of additional charged scalars , which determine their possible appearance both in the higgs boson loop decays under consideration and in their direct searches .",
    "now , an essential point is a lack of yukawa couplings of the scalar quadruplet to a pair of sm fermions .",
    "the lack of these yukawa couplings means that a doubly charged @xmath1 does not decay to a pair of charged sm leptons , which has decisive repercussions .",
    "the direct searches for doubly charged scalars through resonance in the invariant mass of a pair of charged leptons at the lhc  @xcite leave the quadruplet scalar states unconstrained .",
    "the strongest bound in the range ( 383 gev , 408 gev ) set in the inclusive search for the cms benchmark points depends on @xmath1 production analysis , and counts all possible final state lepton pairs in br(@xmath81 ) , @xmath82 .",
    "of course , @xmath1 can decay also to @xmath83 final state , but this channel has not been measured yet and does nt constrain the quadruplet scalar mass .    in comparison ,",
    "the studies of @xmath0 enhancement by the doubly charged scalar from the higgs triplet model of neutrino mass generation  @xcite also lead to their rather small masses , which already seem to be excluded by the above mentioned direct searches at the lhc  @xcite . in case that the decay of the doubly charged component of the triplet scalar to @xmath83 were the dominant one , it would invalidate the discussed cms search and no limit on the triplet mass would be placed either .",
    "it is conceivable that the first sign of new physics observed at the lhc may stem from loop effects of new particles additional to the sm content .",
    "we take under scrutiny particular extensions of the sm higgs sector aimed to explain the small masses of neutrinos , which simultaneously provide doubly charged scalars that significantly affect the loop amplitude for the @xmath0 decay . in view of the upper mentioned exclusion of the doubly charged scalars from the higgs triplet model of neutrino masses ,",
    "we find it timely to explore the effect of doubly charged component of the scalar quadruplet existing in our recent simple tev - scale seesaw model for neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "the results which we obtain show that it is easier to obtain an enhancement of the @xmath0 decay rate in our model than in the higgs triplet model .",
    "the higgs quadruplet is devoid of the yukawa couplings to a pair of leptons which play a decisive role in existing lhc exclusion bounds for doubly charged scalars .",
    "therefore our model in the sub - tev mass region , where a significant enhancement in @xmath58 can be obtained , is not excluded .",
    "also , there is a remarkable feature of achieving the biggest effect on @xmath0 decay rate from the doubly charged @xmath1 state at hand .",
    "the essential @xmath56 coupling ensures that @xmath1 is the lightest among the charged @xmath12 components and that it interferes constructively with the dominant sm contribution of the @xmath38 boson . concerning the monitoring @xmath2 decay ,",
    "the effect is smaller and opposite .",
    "there is a moderate suppression of the @xmath2 decay rate in the region of the parameter space where the @xmath0 decay rate is enhanced .",
    "finally , the imposed role on the scalar quadruplet in explaining the smallness of neutrino masses is decisive in keeping the relevant couplings from the scalar potential small so that the mixing between components of @xmath11 and @xmath12 multiplets is negligible . accordingly , the state announced at the lhc  @xcite corresponds in our setup to the sm higgs boson .",
