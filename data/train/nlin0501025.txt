    "the classical effect of well - developed turbulence is observed in the systems with large values of reynolds number @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the characteristic value of the flow velocity , @xmath7 is the characteristic system size , and @xmath8 is kinematic viscosity . in this case",
    "the chaotic motion is generated by the large nonlinear terms in the navier - stokes equation @xcite . in the recently discovered elastic turbulence phenomena the chaotic behaviour is observed at extremely small reynolds numbers @xmath9 , and is due to elastic instabilities of the polymer solution .",
    "the experimental setup in which this effect has been observed looks as following : a swirling flow is generated between two coaxial disks of the radius @xmath10 and with the gap @xmath11 .",
    "the upper disk is being rotated with the angular frequency @xmath12 , while the lower one is stationary . for small frequencies or usual newtonian liquid the following laminar stationary flow",
    "will be generated : @xmath13 here @xmath14 are the usual cylindrical coordinates with the center coinciding with the center of the lower disk . in the dilute polymer solution",
    "a small chaotic component of the velocity field @xmath15 appears after some critical value of @xmath12 ( but still at small reynolds numbers ) . currently existing theoretical works",
    "are unable to describe the statistical properties of such flow .",
    "thus , it is of interest to study this properties experimentally .",
    "one of the experimental possibilities of such study is the observation of dynamics of single long polymer molecule ( such as dna ) .",
    "it should be stressed , that the observed molecules are not related to the polymers , which are dissolved in the liquid , and which generate the chaotic flow .",
    "the concentration of the observed dna molecules is negligibly small , so they can be treated as passive objects . in the following text",
    "we wo nt analyze the origins of the elastic turbulence , and will denote by the polymers the passive observed dna molecules .",
    "for typical polymers the inertial effects can be neglected , and one can assume that the polymer simply follows the lagrangian trajectories of the velocity field . in this case",
    "the velocity field affects the internal polymer dynamics in two ways : firstly the local velocity gradients lead to the polymer stretching and rotation , secondly , if the flow parameters are spatially inhomogeneous ( which happens for example in the experimental setup described above ) , the lagrangian advection can lead to the time dependent local velocity gradients , corresponding to the stationary velocity component . in our analysis",
    "we neglect the second effect . in the case of the elastic turbulence experimental setup described above",
    ", the advection in the radial direction , which leads to the variations of the local shear rate is determined only by the chaotic component which is assumed to be small .",
    "it means the that significant changes of the local shear rate , due to lagrangian advection occur on the time scales , much larger than the characteristic time scales associated with the internal polymer dynamics .",
    "therefore in the adiabatic approximation one can assume the local shear rates , correposding to the regular velocity component to be constant .",
    "polymer extension can be described by the simple dumb - bell model , where the end - to - end separation vector * r * satisfies the following equation @xcite : @xmath16 where the relaxation rate @xmath17 is the function of the absolute value @xmath10 of the vector @xmath18 , the velocity gradient @xmath19 is taken at the molecule position , and @xmath20 is the thermal langevin force .",
    "we assume that velocity field is large - scale , so it can be assumed to be smooth on the polymer size .",
    "this assumption justifies , the linear approximation of the velocity field used in ( [ main ] ) . in this paper",
    "we discuss two different situations .",
    "firstly when the lyapunov exponent , corresponding to the velocity field is larger than the polymer relaxation rate , so the coil - stretch transition has already occurred , the polymer becomes nonlinearly stretched so , one can neglect the thermal forces @xmath20 acting on him @xcite .",
    "one can introduce the polymer direction vector @xmath21 , which is in this case described by the following equation : @xmath22 one can see that the direction evolution is completely decoupled from the dynamics of the polymer size @xmath10 . in the second situation beyond the coil - stretch transition , one can not neglect the thermal force @xmath20 and the dynamics of the polymer direction becomes more complicated .",
    "we will study only the statistics of the polymer size @xmath10 in this case .",
    "if the average polymer size is much smaller than it s nonlinear length , one can assume the relaxation @xmath23 to be constant , in which case the equation ( [ main ] ) becomes constant and can be easily analyzed .",
    "next , it is important to discuss how the chaotic velocity component is modeled .",
    "the statistical properties of the velocity field , observed in the chaotic turbulence are not known neither from the experimental nor theoretical points of view . in this paper",
    "we will study the simplest model when the velocity field consists of the strong stationary shear component and of the weak short correlated chaotic component . under this assumptions",
    "the velocity gradient matrix has the following form : @xmath24 here we assume that the shear flow occurs in the @xmath25 plane ( note that this plane is stationary in the rotating frame , associated with the polymer ) .",
    "the exact form of the correlation function ( [ sigmacorr ] ) assumes the isotropy of velocity component , however as we will see this assumption is not important , because in the case of strong shear component @xmath26 the polymer spends most of the time stretched in the @xmath27 directions , and it s angular dynamics is determined only by the @xmath28 component of the chaotic velocity field .    in order to simplify the equations on the polymer direction we parameterize the vector @xmath29 as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : orient ] . the eq .",
    "( [ direct ] ) acquires the following form @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are zero mean random variables related to chaotic components of the velocity gradient .",
    "the statistics of both @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be obtained from the correlation function ( [ sigmacorr ] ) : @xmath33",
    "it follows from ( [ direct ] ) that for the stretched polymers the angular dynamics is decoupled from the dynamics of the polymer size . in the case of @xmath26",
    "the regular component will play the main role in the evolution of the polymer direction . for vanishing chaotic component @xmath35",
    "the deterministic polymer dynamics can be easily analyzed : there are two semistable equilibrium states @xmath36 , and the polymer direction vector @xmath29 asymptotically approaches one of these points depending on it s initial orientation .",
    "however when the angle between polymer and equilibrium direction becomes sufficiently small , the chaotic components @xmath37 can not be neglected , and the polymer dynamics becomes stochastic . after some time the chaotic component transfers the polymer into instable region , and regular velocity quickly ( on times of order @xmath38 ) transfers it to the opposite equilibrium direction . due to stochastic nature of the chaotic velocity component",
    "one will observe random a - periodic tumbling of polymer .",
    "this phenomena was qualitatively analyzed in @xcite for general velocity statistics . in this work",
    "we focus on the situation where the chaotic flow is short correlated , such that it s characteristic correlation time @xmath39 is small compared to the time scale , associated with the tumbling effect which as we will show can be estimated as @xmath40",
    ". this assumption will allow us to obtain some rigorous results on the stationary and dynamical statistics of polymer .",
    "when the chaotic component is weak enough @xmath41 the polymer spends most of the time in the stochastic regime , close to the equilibrium point , so that it s angles are small @xmath42 ( we will analyze only one equilibrium point , because of the symmetry @xmath43 ) . in this case one can set @xmath44 in the correlation function ( [ phicorr ] ) , so the dynamics of angle @xmath34 becomes decoupled from everything else , and one can write the corresponding fokker - planck equation : @xmath45p(t,\\phi ) = 0\\ ] ] one of the important questions that should be discussed here are the boundary conditions , that should be used with this equation .",
    "the equation is invariant under the transformations @xmath46 .",
    "therefore it would be natural to use periodic boundary conditions @xmath47 . in this case",
    "there will exist an asymptotic stationary solution of ( [ fokker ] ) @xmath48 .",
    "obviously , all angles differing to the value divisible by @xmath49 are identical to each other in this solution .",
    "another possibility is to use traditional boundary conditions @xmath50 . in this case",
    "the angles @xmath34 and @xmath51 are not equivalent , and one can study the statistics of the number of polymer rotations .",
    "the main disadvantage of such approach is that there is no stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation , because the pdf is widening and drifting constantly .",
    "however both of the approaches lead to the same physical results , the following identity holds between two different pdfs : @xmath52 in order to find the stationary pdf @xmath48 we rewrite the fokker - planck equation in the following form : @xmath53\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] trivial integration leads to the following expression for pdf : @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the average rotation frequency of the polymer , which is determined from the normalization condition @xmath56 and is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 . in the most interesting case @xmath59 , the pdf will be localized at small angles @xmath60 and all expressions are significantly simplified : @xmath61\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can see , that the pdf is asymmetric and has wide algebraic tails : @xmath62 where the last asymptotic is valid in the intermediate region @xmath63 the asymptotic @xmath64 corresponds to the non - zero probability flux at @xmath65 which is a manifestation of the described above tumbling effect .",
    "positive value of the average angle @xmath34 shows , that the polymer spends most of the time in the region @xmath66 in agreement with the qualitative analysis presented in the first sections of this paper .",
    "one can see , that the polymer spends most of the time in the region of small angles , therefore the only relevant velocity component @xmath67 .",
    "the assumption of isotropic statistics of chaotic velocity component is not therefore significant for the qualitative results of this paper .      in this section",
    "we will calculate the probability distribution function of the time intervals between consequent tumblings .",
    "such pdf can be directly measured experimentally . for this problem",
    "it is naturally to use the non - stationary pdf @xmath68 .",
    "we will define the tumbling process by a polymer direction `` trajectory '' starting at @xmath69 and reaching @xmath70 at time @xmath71 . in this case",
    "the probability of finding the polymer inside this region is given by @xmath72 where the initial condition is @xmath73 , so @xmath74 .",
    "we substitute @xmath75 . in this case",
    "the evolution of @xmath76 is determined by the one - dimensional schroedinger equation in imaginary time : @xmath77 now it is possible to use the quantum - mechanical analogy .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath78 formally describes a particle in periodic potential with the period @xmath49 .",
    "general solution of this problem looks like @xmath79 where @xmath80 is particle s quasimomentum , and index @xmath81 enumerates the brillouin zone number . in this potential the classical minimums",
    "are separated by large barriers . and",
    "for @xmath26 one can use the tight - binding method @xcite .",
    "the following approximate relations hold for the spectrum : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the spectrum , which is formed near classical minimums , when the tunneling processes are neglected .",
    "@xmath8 is exponentially small band width .",
    "therefore at large times the main asymptotic of @xmath84 will be determined by the ground state energy @xmath85 : @xmath86 one can easily check that this energy is given by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a constant of order unity .",
    "indeed , the classical minima is situated in the region of small angles @xmath89 , so one can use taylor expansions of trigonometric functions . after",
    "the substitution @xmath90 one obtains the hamiltonian @xmath91.\\ ] ] the operator in square brackets contains no dimensionless parameters , and therefore it s eigenvalues will be of order unity . the body of the pdf is also situated in the region of tumbling periods of order @xmath92 .",
    "left tail of tumbling time pdf @xmath93 is determined by rare trajectories , which turn the polymer by angle @xmath49 at small times @xmath71 . in order to find the optimal form of such trajectories we will functional integral representation of the transition probability @xmath94\\ ] ] the integration is taken over trajectories with boundary conditions @xmath95 . for small @xmath96",
    "the probability is determined by the action @xmath97 on the optimal trajectory @xmath98 with exponential accuracy .",
    "variation of the effective action leads to the following equation on instanton : @xmath99 this mechanical problem can be easily solved , and one obtains the following relation between the tumbling time and effective particle energy :    @xmath100^{1/4 }   k\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\sqrt{\\frac{e}{4e+2s^2}}\\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath101 is elliptical integral of the first kind .",
    "the action in this case is given by @xmath102    here we omitted the constant term @xmath103 because it is cancelled by the normalization constant .",
    "because of additional time scale @xmath38 there are two different asymptotes of @xmath84 . in the case of",
    "@xmath104 one has @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in this case @xmath107 in another limiting case @xmath108 the energy is given by @xmath109 and the action has the following form : @xmath110 the intermediate asymptotic ( [ inter ] ) is a function of the product @xmath111 because it is determined by the dynamics in the region of small angles .",
    "therefore it will be universal , in the sense mentioned above . in contrary , the asymptotic at the smallest times ( [ smallest ] ) does not depend on @xmath112 at all , because such small times can be reached only due to very rare fluctuation of chaotic velocity field .",
    "therefore , this asymptotic strongly depends on the assumption of isotropic velocity statistics , and is not universal .      as it was shown in @xcite",
    "there are two contributions to the intermediate right tail of the @xmath113-angle distribution @xmath114 .",
    "the first one is coming from the region of deterministic regions where @xmath115 , where the angular dynamics is determined by the regular terms .",
    "the algebraic tail in this case is proportional to @xmath116 , however there is also a non - universal algebraic part , which comes from the stochastic region of @xmath117 and is determined by the statistical properties of the random velocity field . in this section",
    "we will be interested in this part , and will obtain the connection between the exponent and the entropy function of the random velocity process . in the region @xmath118 the equation ( [ thetaeq ] ) can be easily solved : @xmath119 as we already know the random process @xmath120 is stationary and independent from @xmath121 . in this case",
    "the expression for @xmath113 can be rewritten in the form @xmath122 in order to obtain the pdf @xmath123 we first average over the noise @xmath32 : @xmath124 \\\\   a = 4d \\int_0^\\infty \\mathrm{d}\\tau\\exp[-2\\varrho(\\tau)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath125 is the pdf of @xmath113 for a fixed realization of the process @xmath126 . due to positive value of @xmath127 the body of @xmath123",

    "tails of the pdf are determined by large deviations of negative @xmath126 .",
    "assuming that the process @xmath126 reaches it s most negative value to the time @xmath129 , such that @xmath130 and @xmath131 one can estimate the value of @xmath97 with exponential accuracy as @xmath132 .",
    "the characteristic correlation time of @xmath126 is @xmath133 , so for large @xmath134 one can use the results of large deviations theory @xcite which predict the following scaling for the tails of @xmath135 pdf : @xmath136,\\ ] ] where @xmath137 is the entropy function , which form can not be found analytically in general case .",
    "one can now find the most probable time @xmath129 by maximizing the above probability over @xmath129 .",

    "@xmath179 this equation can not be solved in the case @xmath180 , however for @xmath181 the solution can be easily found . in this case",
    "the main exponential asymptotic at large times is @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the ground state energy . for @xmath181",
    "the main contribution to @xmath183 will be equal to the value of classical minima of the potential .",
    "after some simple algebra we obtain @xmath184 finally we have @xmath185 and the critical value @xmath170 will depend on the dimensionless parameter @xmath186 : @xmath187 the last expression ( [ last ] ) coincides with the value of exponent for pure isotropic chaotic velocity , because in the case @xmath188 large polymer size fluctuations are determined by the rare fluctuations of the chaotic component , when the flow has a strong elongation component with the lyapunov exponent @xmath189 for a long time .",
    "however the result ( [ res ] ) shows that in the case @xmath190 the shear component can significantly broaden the tails of the polymer size pdf .",
    "this fact is nontrivial because the regular shear component itself can not lead to the exponential polymer elongation , and non - trivial exponent comes from the combined effect of chaotic and regular component .",
    "in conclusion we would like to repeat the main results of this paper . a polymer molecule injected in the chaotic flow with the strong mean shear component",
    "becomes strongly stretched in the shear direction and experiences the a - periodic tumbling in the plane of the shear flow .",
    "it is shown , that stationary distribution of the polymer orientation angles has intermediate algebraic asymptotics .",
    "the tails of the @xmath34-angle distribution behave like @xmath191 and correspond to the constant flux solution of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "existence of these asymptotics has been reported in previous papers regarding the dynamics of molecules and small particles in the shear flows @xcite .",
    "however the algebraic asymptotic of the @xmath113-angle distribution has not been reported in any previous papers to our knowledge .",
    "we would like to stress , that in contrary to the pdf of the @xmath34 angle , the asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath113-angle distribution is not universal and depends on the statistical properties of the chaotic velocity component .",
    "therefore in our opinion measurement of the scaling exponent of the @xmath113-angle distribution is a perfect tool for the investigation of the statistical properties of the chaotic velocity .",
    "another quantity which can be measured by direct polymer observations is the pdf of the time periods between consequent polymer tumblings .",
    "the equilibrium direction of the polymer , which is oriented along the shear direction is semistable .",
    "this property leads to frequent polymer tumblings , so that the characteristic time between tumblings is of order @xmath192 .",
    "the situation would be different in the case of vesicles or non - spherical particles in the shear flow @xcite , where the tumbling rate would be exponentially small . in the fourth part of this paper",
    "we make the prediction on the polymer size distribution .",
    "we show , that the existence of the strong shear component leads to the significant broadening of the size distribution compared to the isotropic case , which was considered in @xcite .",
    "this effect is to our opinion rather non - trivial , because the shear component itself can not lead to the exponential elongation of the polymer and the distribution broadening is the combined effect of the chaotic and regular velocity components .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that all results of this paper were obtained under the assumption of isotropic and short - correlated chaotic velocity flow . while the first assumption , as it was discussed throughout the paper is irrelevant for most of the results , the finite correlation time of the velocity flow can lead to the change of some quantitative results of this paper .",
    "however we believe ( see @xcite for the more detailed discussion ) that most qualitative predictions will remain valid if the velocity correlation is smaller or comparable to the characteristic time scale of the polymer dynamics @xmath193 ."
