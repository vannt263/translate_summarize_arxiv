    "many physical processes are interpreted in terms of an oscillator coupled to a thermal bath or to spin systems .",
    "examples abound , mass spectrometry through a nanoelectromechanical oscillator whose resonant frequency decreases as single molecules are added to it @xcite , a spin representing a two - level system is coupled to a boson bath ( the spin - boson system ) to analyze loss of quantum coherence due to the bath @xcite , a classical oscillator coupled to a spin causes wave function collapse thereof @xcite , the classical version of the spin - phonon system describes the collective jahn - teller effect @xcite , large spin systems ( single molecule magnets or nuclear spins ) are coupled to a boson bath @xcite , etc .    in this work , we consider a mechanical degree of freedom represented by a classical harmonic oscillator coupled to a linear chain of @xmath0 ising spins @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the energy of the combined system is equal to the energy of the oscillator alone plus a coupling term proportional to the oscillator position and to @xmath7 .",
    "the spins flip stochastically according to glauber dynamics @xcite . as a consequence of the coupling ,",
    "the oscillator equations of motion become stochastic , and both the position and the momentum of the oscillator become stochastic processes .",
    "the aim of this work is to understand how the equilibrium and the dynamics of the oscillator is affected by the interaction with the spin system ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the oscillator - spin model is described in section [ s2 ] .",
    "its time evolution is governed by newton s second law for the oscillator and the above mentioned glauber dynamics for the spins .",
    "they can be put together in an evolution equation for the joint probability density of finding at time @xmath8 the oscillator at given values of its position and momentum and the ising system at a given configuration .",
    "the canonical distribution at temperature @xmath2 is the equilibrium joint probability density . by summing over all possible spin configurations ,",
    "we obtain the equilibrium probability density for the oscillator .",
    "the latter is a canonical distribution with an effective potential energy which is the sum of the harmonic potential and the free energy of the spin chain for fixed oscillator position .",
    "section [ s3 ] is devoted to analyzing the equilibrium configuration . by finding the minima of the effective potential ,",
    "we show that there is a second order phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath3 , with the stable rest position of the oscillator ( equilibrium ) as its order parameter . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the oscillator equilibrium position is the same as that of the uncoupled oscillator . for @xmath10 ,",
    "two symmetric nonzero equilibrium positions issue forth from zero as in the diagram of a pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "these nonzero equilibrium positions behave as @xmath11 as the number of spins @xmath0 goes to infinity , so that the harmonic contribution to the energy be extensive in the thermodynamic limit . on the other hand , the fluctuations scale as @xmath1 far from the critical temperature . very close to @xmath3",
    ", there is a crossover and equilibrium fluctuations scale as @xmath12 .",
    "although ising spins in the chain are coupled to their nearest neighbours , their coupling constant is proportional to the oscillator position which makes their interaction effectively long range .",
    "similar hidden long - range effective correlations that enable possible 1d phase transitions are present in biophysical systems .",
    "an example is dna melting @xcite which has been modeled by means of modified ising systems @xcite , different from the one considered here .",
    "the dynamics of the system is studied in section [ s4 ] . in the limit of fast relaxation of the spins compared to the natural period of the oscillator",
    ", there is a clear separation of time scales , a fast one associated to the relaxation of the spins and a slow one associated to the oscillator . in this regime",
    ", we find a reduced dynamics of the oscillator with nonlinear friction and a nonlinear force term .",
    "this nonlinear evolution equation is one of the main results of our paper . basically , the spins approach their equilibrium distribution corresponding to the instantaneous value of the oscillator position .",
    "this produces the effective potential ( already found in the equilibrium analysis ) for the oscillator and gives rise to the nonlinear force term in its nonlinear evolution equation . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonlinear friction is a purely dynamical effect that can not be obtained from analyzing the equilibrium distribution of the system .",
    "this friction arises from the slow evolution of the oscillator resulting in a slight deviation of the ising spins from its equilibrium with a fixed position of the oscillator .",
    "the friction term drives the system to equilibrium in the long time limit .",
    "the stationary solutions of the reduced dynamics coincide with the oscillator equilibrium positions at any given temperature .",
    "we also discuss the expected range of validity of the nonlinear dynamical equation . for @xmath9 ( section [ s4a ] ) , we can linearize the oscillator reduced evolution equation about its stable rest state . the solutions",
    "are underdamped oscillations whose frequency decreases as @xmath2 decreases : the oscillator is slowed down by the spins .",
    "there is a narrow region of overdamped oscillations for temperatures very close to @xmath3 .",
    "a similar analysis is carried out in section [ s4b ] , but for @xmath10 .",
    "there is also a very narrow region of overdamped oscillations near @xmath3 . for lower temperatures @xmath10 ,",
    "our theory predicts underdamped oscillations around one of the two nonvanishing stable equilibrium points .    in section [ s5 ]",
    ", we compare numerical simulations for the model with the theoretical results and test the range of validity of the theory .",
    "the numerical simulations show excellent agreement with the theory for sufficiently high temperature @xmath9 and for 1000 or more spins .",
    "as @xmath2 decreases towards @xmath3 , the numerical solutions of our theory and the simulations show the same qualitative trends , i.e. , underdamped oscillations , but these oscillations are shifted by some constant value .",
    "this is an effect due to the initial conditions as reducing the size thereof brings again quantitative agreement between theory and simulations . below the critical temperature , but not very far from it , more spins are necessary to attain good average values and our theory still gives an adequate description of the dynamical evolution of the system . as the temperature",
    "is further lowered , we again need fewer spins to attain good averages over spin indices and trajectories but there are qualitative differences between theory and simulations .",
    "breakdown of the theoretical predictions is expected for sufficiently low temperatures , because of the divergence of the relaxation time of the spins @xcite .",
    "lastly , section [ s6 ] contains final remarks and comments .",
    "we consider a system comprising one dimensional harmonic oscillator ( mass @xmath13 , frequency @xmath14 , position @xmath15 and momentum @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 internal degrees of freedom modeled by ising spins ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the system has an energy @xmath20 in which @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the energy of the uncoupled oscillator and the interaction energy between the oscillator and the spins , respectively .",
    "the latter can also be understood as a nearest neighbour interaction between the spins with a coupling constant @xmath23 which is proportional to the oscillator position @xmath15 , @xmath24 the parameter @xmath25 measures the strength of the coupling between the oscillator and the ising system . because of the sum over spins in ( [ 2.2c ] ) , @xmath25 should decrease with @xmath0 for the system to have a well defined behaviour in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "we will show later that @xmath27 as mentioned in section [ s1 ] .",
    "alternatively , the hamiltonian ( [ 2.2a ] ) can also be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total potential acting on the oscillator .",
    "the dynamics of the system is governed by hamilton s equations of motion for the oscillator , @xmath30 or , equivalently , @xmath31 and by an appropriate stochastic dynamics for the spins ( because they are in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath2 ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the spins will be assumed to evolve with glauber - like one spin flip dynamics . at any time @xmath8 ,",
    "the system may experience a transition from @xmath32 to @xmath33 with a rate given by @xcite @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the configuration obtained from @xmath36 by rotating the @xmath37-th spin . here",

    ".nondimensional units and parameters .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is convenient to render our equations dimensionless before we proceed with their analysis .",

    "the maxima of @xmath48 determine the most likely position and momentum of the oscillator coupled to the ising system , @xmath68 , when the total system is at equilibrium .",
    "these most likely values will be called _ macroscopic equilibrium values _ following van kampen s terminology @xcite . as @xmath69 , the equilibrium mean values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 coincide with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , whereas the corresponding variances tend to zero .",
    "similarly , the equilibrium average value of an smooth function @xmath72 tends to its macroscopic value : @xmath73 as @xmath69 .",
    "thus a macroscopic quantity has negligible fluctuations in the limit of infinitely many oscillators .",
    "let us now calculate @xmath70 and @xmath71 and the corresponding variances .",
    "first , @xmath74 and the oscillator is at rest in equilibrium , as expected .",

    "it is the only solution for @xmath79 , it corresponds to a maximum of @xmath80 and is therefore stable . at @xmath81 two new stable equilibria issue from @xmath77 and exist for @xmath82 .",
    "note that in dimensional units , @xmath83 corresponds to @xmath84 , the critical temperature defined in ( [ 2.15 ] ) .",
    "besides , @xmath3 should be independent of @xmath0 in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "this gives the scaling of @xmath25 with @xmath0 mentioned in the introduction , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , @xmath87 making use of ( [ 2.15 ] ) .",
    "as @xmath88 , we find @xmath89 i.e. the usual scaling at pitchfork bifurcations , latexmath:[$\\widetilde{x}_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize{eq}}}}\\propto    @xmath81 , @xmath91 as @xmath92",
    ". then the derivative of @xmath93 with respect to @xmath2 is also continuous at @xmath94 .",
    "we have found a second order , continuous , phase transition with classical critical exponents .",
    "the equilibrium position @xmath15 can then be considered the order parameter of the transition : its macroscopic value vanishes for @xmath95 and is non - zero for @xmath96 .",
    "why does this second order transition appear ?",
    "at first , it seems surprising to find it in a 1d model with short - ranged interactions . in order to understand the physical reason for this behaviour ,",
    "let us calculate the equilibrium probability @xmath97 of finding the spins in configuration @xmath98 , regardless of the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "then ( [ 3.7 ] ) corresponds to the equilibrium probability of a mean field ising model .",
    "each spin @xmath104 is coupled to the global mean field @xmath105 and an effective long range interaction appears in the model .",
    "it is a well - known result that the 1d mean field ising model has a second order phase transition at a finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic , most probable , value of @xmath106 is given by solutions of the trascendental equation @xcite @xmath107 there appears a second order transition at a critical temperature @xmath81 , which is the same one appearing in eq .",
    "( [ 3.3 ] ) .",
    "the origin of this transition is the _ hidden _ long - range effective coupling between spins ( [ 3.7 ] ) which is produced by the coupling of the glauber spins to the oscillator .",
    "similar hidden long - range effective correlations that enable possible 1d phase transitions are present in biophysical systems .",
    "an example is dna melting @xcite which has been modeled by means of modified ising systems @xcite , different from the one considered here . for dna melting ,",
    "the order of the phase transition has not yet been well established : depending on models and conditions , it has been predicted to be first order @xcite , second order @xcite , or even higher @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of the order parameter @xmath15 can be analyzed from the equilibrium distribution ( [ 2.21 ] ) in the limit @xmath69 .",
    "the average of any function of @xmath15 can be calculated by using the laplace method in integrals involving ( [ 2.21 ] ) , which leads to expanding the effective potential ( [ 2.22 ] ) around the macroscopic value @xmath70 .",

    "therefore , for @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , the fluctuations of @xmath15 are gaussian because higher order terms vanish as @xmath26 .",

    "similarly , @xmath115 .",
    "since @xmath70 is of order one for @xmath17 and @xmath112 , the fluctuation of @xmath15 is much smaller than its average value , which is the expected behaviour of a macroscopic variable .",
    "the average value of @xmath54 at equilibrium verifies @xmath116=\\frac{n}{2}\\omega^2 \\langle \\left ( x-\\widetilde{x}_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize{eq } } } } \\right)^2\\rangle = \\frac{\\theta}{2 } \\ , , \\label{3.12}\\ ] ] for @xmath112 .",
    "the term coming from gaussian fluctuations is subdominant in the thermodynamic limit as compared to the extensive macroscopic contribution @xmath117 .    on the other hand , @xmath118 and therefore @xmath119 in ( [ 3.11 ] ) diverges as @xmath120 : fluctuation divergence is connected to the vanishing of the renormalized frequency @xmath110 .",
    "a very large value of @xmath0 , diverging for @xmath120 , has to be considered in order to be in the `` thermodynamic limit '' for the oscillator position , where @xmath15 is approximately equal to its most probable value @xmath70 and its fluctuactions can be neglected .",
    "what happens for @xmath121 ?",
    "the first three differentials of the effective potential vanish at @xmath81 whereas @xmath122 .",
    "then , as @xmath123 @xmath124 and a similar expression holds as @xmath92 ( replacing @xmath125 in ( [ 3.13 ] ) by @xmath126 ) .",
    "therefore the fluctuations scale is @xmath127 as @xmath69 if @xmath128 ( non - gaussian behaviour , the quadratic term can be neglected in comparison to the quartic term ) and as @xmath129 if @xmath130 dynamics --------    in this section we shall analyze the dynamical equations of motion . equation ( [ 2.16 ] ) is a stochastic differential equation for @xmath15 because the configuration of the spin system @xmath36 is a stochastic process .",
    "let us denote @xmath131 , with @xmath19 and @xmath132 .",
    "of course , @xmath133 for all @xmath37 . by averaging ( [ 2.16 ] ) over the joint probability @xmath134 solution of the liouville - master equation ( [ 2.6 ] ) , we obtain @xmath135 from the liouville - master equation , we can derive the following system of equations for the spin correlations @xmath136 for @xmath137 and @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath138 and @xmath139 are given by ( [ 2.18bis ] ) .",
    "the system of equations ( [ 4.2 ] ) must be solved with the boundary condition @xmath140 and given initial conditions @xmath141 .",
    "as explained in section [ s3 ] , a quantity is called macroscopic if , compared to its mean , its fluctuations are negligible in the limit as @xmath69 . in this section",
    ", we will describe the mean - field ( macroscopic ) dynamics of our oscillator - spin system such that @xmath142 in the limit as @xmath69 for any smooth function @xmath143 . in these equations and for each time",

    "then @xmath146 is independent of @xmath37 and we can write @xmath149 instead of @xmath146 ( or @xmath148 ) in ( [ 4.-1])-([4.4 ] ) . since @xmath150 , we have @xmath151 . ignoring fluctuations according to ( [ 4.0 ] ) , equation ( [ 4.-1 ] ) yields @xmath152 and ( [ 4.2 ] ) simplifies to @xmath153 corresponding to van kampen s macroscopic approximation @xcite .",
    "this approximation is equivalent to separating macroscopic and fluctuating contributions in @xmath15 and @xmath147 : @xmath154 inserting these expressions in ( [ 4.2 ] ) and neglecting all terms containing correlations , such as @xmath155 or @xmath156 , we obtain again ( [ 4.6 ] ) .",
    "the mean - field or macroscopic dynamical behaviour of the oscillator - spin system is found by solving the equations ( [ 4.1 ] ) and ( [ 4.6 ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath157 and appropriate initial conditions .",

    "after this initial layer , we can approximately solve ( [ 4.2 ] ) by means of an expansion in powers of @xmath139 : @xmath163 this yields the boundary conditions @xmath164 , @xmath165 . inserting ( [ 4.7 ] ) into ( [ 4.6 ] ) , we obtain the following system of equations @xmath166 and so on . the solutions of ( [ 4.8 ] ) and ( [ 4.9 ] ) with boundary conditions @xmath167 and @xmath168 are found in [ apa ]",

    "is @xmath77 .",
    "this equilibrium is asymptotically stable due to the presence of the damping term , and therefore @xmath187 for long enough times .",
