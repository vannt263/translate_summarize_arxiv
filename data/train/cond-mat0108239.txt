    "electronic phase segregation in transition metal oxide systems has become an important topic in condensed matter physics.dagotto01,moreo99,rao97,levi98,tranquada95 systems which exhibit colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) , high temperature superconductivity , and other compounds such as the nickelates,@xcite phase segregate into electron - rich and electron - poor regions .",

    "the magnitude of the afm  term decreases and the hyperfine term increases and is nearly the same as the undoped value .",
