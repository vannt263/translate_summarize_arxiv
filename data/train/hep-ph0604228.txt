    "in this talk i want to discuss the special role that the photon linear collider ( plc ) can play when it comes to supersymmetry searches / studies at the future colliders . before doing this ,",
    "let us just briefly recapitulate the basics of supersymmetry ( susy ) , the attractions that the tev scale supersymmetry holds for the particle physics community and the reasons why the searches for susy form a significant part of the physics studies at the colliders : currently running and/or in planning / construction@xcite .",
    "supersymmetry , a symmetry transformation between fermions and bosons , is the only possible extension of the space - time symmetries to particle interactions . in other words",
    "this is the only consistent way to combine space - time symmetries with an internal symmetry .",
    "in addition supersymmetric field theories are the only quantum field theories which remain natural@xcite even in presence of scalars . as a result supersymmetry helps stabilize the ew symmetry breaking scale against radiative corrections .",
    "susy thus provides a solution to the naturalness problem , which is theoretically very attractive and elegant . in these theories ,",
    "associated with every standard model particle there is a supersymmetric partner , the sparticle , differing in spin by 1/2 .",
    "the left panel in    , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] indicates how the sparticle loops help cancel the large self energy corrections , keeping the higgs mass naturally light . as a matter of fact in the limit of perfect supersymmetry , where the particle and sparticle masses are equal",
    ", these corrections will cancel each other exactly .",
    "even if susy is broken , one can show that existence of a tev scale supersymmetry will keep the higgs naturally light .",
    "the experiments of the past few decades , culminating in the high precision measurements at the colliders and the neutrino experiments , have established the correctness of both the gauge sector and the flavour sector of the sm lagrangian given by , @xmath2 only the scalar sector remains without direct evidence .",
    "the tevatron and the lep / slc give indirect bounds on the higgs mass .",
    "analysis of precision measurements from lep in terms of the oblique parameters , @xmath3@xcite , constrain strongly any * nondecoupling new * physics beyond the sm .",
    "the plot in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , taken from the http://lepewwwg.web.cern.ch , illustrates these constraints .",
    "this indirect upper bound on the higgs mass at @xmath4 c.l .",
    "is @xmath5 gev , whereas the direct searches give a lower bound of @xmath6 gev .",
    "thus the precision measurements like a light higgs . as a matter of fact , theorists like a light higgs as well .",
    "if the sm is an effective theory , then we expect @xmath7 gev .",
    "further , in a model independent analysis  @xcite , one can show that if the scale for new physics @xmath8 tev , then one expects , demanding naturalness @xmath9 ; susy being a particular example of the new physics which keeps the higgs naturally light .",
    "these experimental indications of a light higgs make susy theoretically very attractive .",
    "the search for susy is thus the case of experiments chasing a beautiful theoretical idea .",
    "even if it is a symmetry of nature , it is clearly broken .",
    "further , all the experimental searches so far have yielded only negative results , giving only * lower * limits on the sparticle masses .",
    "the only , _ very indirect _ indication for susy at present seems to be the absence of the unification of the three gauge couplings in the sm , whereas in the mssm the three do unify .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    this is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "it is imperative to find direct evidence for susy . as a result",
    ", susy searches have been an important benchmark against which the capabilities and physics potential of the upcoming colliders such as the lhc or the ones in future such as the ilc , have been evaluated .",
    "the sparticle mass spectrum depends on the mechanism responsible for susy breaking and can vary widely , but the sparticle spins and couplings are predicted unambiguously . with the help of the the lhc and the ilc in the @xmath10",
    "@xcite we hope to find the sparticles , measure their masses spins and couplings .",
    "the masses and the couplings of the @xmath11 and the supsesymmetric partners of the third generation of the quarks / leptons , can depend on the susy breaking mechanism and parameters .",
    "the lhc will be able to see the strongly interacting sparticles if the susy breaking scale is tev .",
    "if the sparticle mass is within the kinematic reach of the ilc , we should be able to make accurate mass measurements and spin determination .",
    "the lhc and the ilc together can even help us determine the susy model parameters and hence the susy breaking mechanism  @xcite . on this background",
    "it is important to inquire about the special role , if any , that the plc can play in this context .",
    "there are certain regions in the susy parameter space where the lhc and the ilc in the @xmath1 mode may be blind and or the signal may be lost .",
    "the @xmath12 mode and @xmath13 mode does provide possibilities to search for susy in this case .",
    "however , a more important question to ask is what are the unique possibilities offered by the plc .",
    "almost all of these come in the context of the supersymmetric higgs sector ; especially in the context of higgs sector with cp violation .",
    "plc with its option of having highly polarised photons , offers some unique possibilities .",
    "some of these have already been discussed in the meeting  @xcite . in the next section",
    "we would discuss these one by one .",
    "the plc provides truly unique possibilities in probing the higgs sector in the mssm  @xcite . in supersymmetric theories",
    "there are ( at least ) five scalar states : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 are cp even whereas @xmath17 is cp odd and the @xmath18 is bounded from above . in the decoupling limit",
    "@xmath19 will have properties very similar to a sm higgs .",
    "the mssm parameters relevant for this sector are @xmath20 ( the ratio of vacuum expectation values ) , higgsino mass term @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the special features of a @xmath12 collider that are of special help , are :    1 .",
    "accurate measurements ( @xmath23 ) of the @xmath0 decay width is possible .",
    "polarisation of the laser and as well as that of the @xmath24 beam can be tuned .",
    "the @xmath13 option where polarised electron is scattered off the high energy backscattered photon provides an extra channel .",
    "below i will discuss three examples where the plc can cover regions of susy parameter space which will be inaccessible to the lhc and the ilc in the @xmath1 mode .",
    "studies of the @xmath26 at @xmath1 colliders provide possibilities of the determination of susy parameters , @xmath27 and @xmath20 . however , accuracy of the @xmath20 determination is degraded at large @xmath20 mainly because the observable involves @xmath28 .",
    "a recent suggestion@xcite is to use the @xmath25fusion process @xmath29 ; where @xmath30 denotes the higgs boson .",
    "fusion production rates for @xmath19 and @xmath31 production , along with the background at the plc shown in the left and the right panel respectively .",
    "the peaked photon spectrum is used @xcite.[fig3],title=\"fig : \" ] fusion production rates for @xmath19 and @xmath31 production , along with the background at the plc shown in the left and the right panel respectively .",
    "the peaked photon spectrum is used @xcite.[fig3],title=\"fig : \" ]    plots in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] show that indeed for all the three higgs states , the signal is substantially above the background .",
    "one can see that the process offers a possibility of accurate @xmath20 determination at large @xmath32 .",
    "for example , at @xmath33@xmath34 .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the precision of @xmath35@xmath36 that can be reached at the @xmath1 option  @xcite .",
    "the conclusions of this very interesting study need to be confirmed by simulations .      as is seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , in a plot taken from the tesla - tdr  @xcite , for @xmath37 , @xmath38@xmath39 gev , lhc will see only one spin 0 state and the @xmath40 are not accessible for the first generation ilc .",
    "this region is referred to as the lhc - wedge .",
    "the @xmath12 colliders offer unique possibilities of exploring this region .",
    "since @xmath31 can be produced singly at a @xmath12 collider , the reach in mass extends to @xmath41 at the @xmath12 option compared to the @xmath42 at the @xmath1 option .",
    "@xmath43 of course is the cm energy of the parent @xmath1 collider .",
    "the qed background can be reduced by appropriately choosing the laser photon and the electron helicities . for the larger @xmath32 range",
    ", @xmath44 final state can be utilised effectively .",
    "however , for the smaller @xmath20 values the @xmath45 coupling reduces and the qed background being much higher for the @xmath46 final state ( due to the larger charge of the @xmath47 quark ) , it can not be used effectively either . in this region",
    "decays of @xmath31 into the @xmath48 may be used  @xcite .",
    "a detailed simulation of the @xmath44 final state for this lhc - wedge region has been performed  @xcite .",
    "a summary of their conclusion is that for the light higgs the @xmath12 width can be measured @xmath49 , however in the case of @xmath31 the precision is somewhat worse : @xmath50@xmath51 . as said earlier , one can handle the qed background , by adjusting the helicities of the two photons . for the @xmath52",
    "there were suggestions to separate the two by choosing the polarisation vectors of the two photons to be perpendicular and parallel .",
    "however , in this case the qed background can not be handled easily .",
    "the precise measurement of the the width @xmath0 at the plc can offer a probe of the contribution due to susy particles in the loop to the higgs width  @xcite .",
    "cp violation in susy used to be an embarrassment of riches , as there exist large , number ( 44 to be precise ) of phases of the susy parameters , e.g. @xmath53@xmath54 which can not be rotated away by a simple redefinition of the fields .",
    "these can generate unacceptably large electric dipole moments for fermions and hence one of the solutions normally was to fine tune all the @xmath55 phases in susy to zero .",
    "it has been shown that it is possible for some combination of these phases to be o ( 1 ) and yet satisfy _ all _ the constraints on the edm s provided the first two generation of squarks are heavy  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that such @xmath55 phases can induce cp mixing in the higgs sector of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "this leads to mixing between the cp - even @xmath16 and the cp - odd @xmath17 in the mssm .",
    "the couplings of the three mass eigenstates @xmath56 , ( @xmath57 ) , are modified compared to the cp - conserving case .",
    "in particular , the @xmath58 may develop a large pseudoscalar component , giving @xmath59 and hence @xmath60 .",
    "this is the simplest way in which cp - violation may invalidate the lower limits on the higgs mass obtained by lep .",
    "the lep data can now allow a much lighter higgs with a mass @xmath61@xmath62 gev @xcite due to a reduction in the @xmath63 coupling in the cpx scenario  @xcite .",
    "the latter corresponds to a certain choice of the cp - violating susy parameters , chosen so as to showcase the cp - violation in the higgs sector in this case . in a large portion of this region all the usual search channels of such a light higgs at the lhc",
    "are also not expected to be viable  @xcite due to the simultaneous reduction in the coupling of the higgs to a vector boson pair as well as the @xmath64 pair . as a matter of fact for @xmath65 gev",
    ", there may exist a hole in the susy parameter space in case of cp - violation .",
    "part of this hole can be filled up , by taking advantage of the light @xmath66 which can be produced in the top decay and which in turn has a large branching ratio in the @xmath67 channel  @xcite . even after this , some part of this hole still remains",
    ".    a plc will be able to produce such a neutral higgs in all cases ; independent of whether it is a state with even / odd or indeterminate cp parity .",
    "it is possible to determine the cp mixing , if present , by using the polarisation of the initial state @xmath68 or that of the fermions into which the @xmath69 decays  @xcite .",
    "a unique feature of a plc is that the two photons can form a @xmath70 state with both even and odd cp . as a result",
    "a plc has a similar level of sensitivity for both the cp - odd and cp - even components of a cp - mixed state : @xmath71 \\cdot k_{\\gamma }    = \\omega_{\\gamma } i \\lambda_1(1+\\lambda_1\\lambda_2)/2,\\ ] ] @xmath72 and @xmath73 denoting the energies and helicities of the two photons respectively ; the helicity of the system is equal to @xmath74 .",
    "this contrasts the @xmath1 case , where it is easy to discriminate between cp - even and cp - odd particles but may be difficult to detect small cp - violation effects for a dominantly cp - even higgs boson  @xcite . for the plc , one can form three polarization asymmetries in terms of helicity amplitudes which give a clear measure of cp mixing @xcite .",
    "note however that these require linearly polarised photons in addition to the circularly polarised photons .",
    "one can also use information on the decay products of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 or @xmath78 coming from the higgs decay .",
    "even with just the circular beam polarization almost mass degenerate ( cp - odd ) @xmath17 and ( cp - even ) @xmath79 of the mssm may be separated @xcite .",
    "in the situation that the mass difference between the h and a is less than the sum of their widths , a coupled channel analysis technique  @xcite has to be used . the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite explore this situation whereas the use of decay fermion polarisation for determination of the higgs cp property for a generic choice of the mssm parameters is explored in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the process @xmath80 receives contribution from the process where the @xmath30 is exchanged in the @xmath81channel and thus probes the @xmath82 and @xmath83 couplings : @xmath84 and @xmath85.\\ ] ] @xmath86 depend upon @xmath87 , @xmath88 etc . in",
    "( @xmath89 violating ) mssm .",
    "the helicity amplitudes involve four cp - even and cp - odd combinations of the different form factors , @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the qed background is @xmath91 , @xmath89 and chirality conserving , while the @xmath30 exchange diagram violates these symmetries .",
    "thus nonzero values of @xmath92 indicate existence of chirality flipping interactions as opposed to the chirality conserving qed interactions . as a result",
    "the fermion polarisation can be a probe of the @xmath30 contribution as well as any possible cp - violation in the @xmath82 and @xmath93 coupling .",
    "the polarisation of the initial state @xmath68 can be controlled by adjusting the initial laser and the @xmath94 polarisation .",
    "the @xmath30 contribution is enhanced using the combination @xmath95 .",
    "one can construct observables , with unpolarised and polarised laser and @xmath94 beams : @xmath96 and @xmath97 which are both probes of cp violating interaction , and @xmath98 @xmath99 which are probes of chirality flipping interactions . here",
    "@xmath100 refer in the ( double ) superscripts of @xmath101 refer to the polarisation of the @xmath102 .",
    "left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the predicted value of @xmath103 as a a function of @xmath104 for @xmath105 500 gev and 600 gev , using the ideal back - scattered photons , with @xmath106 .",
    "the peak occurs when the average mass of @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( @xmath109 matches with the @xmath110 value where the backscattered laser photon luminosity peaks .",
    "the right panel shows , the expected values of the cp - violating asymmetry @xmath111 as a function of the two mssm parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113 is adjusted for each point in the scan such that the peak of the photon spectrum matches with scaled mass @xmath109 .",
    "nowhere in this range of the parameters are the two states extremely degenerate , and hence a coupled channel analysis is not required .",
    "we see that even in this case , the size of the expected asymmetries is not too small .",
    "thus in a generic case of cpv mssm the plc can probe this cp - mixing in the higgs sector .",
    "the case of extreme degeneracy has been studied for the plc in  @xcite    ]    fig .",

    "the decay leptons from @xmath47-quark carry information about its polarization .",
    "one can construct asymmetries combining charge of lepton and polarization of the initial state @xmath118 of the plc .",
    "parameterizing the cross - sections as @xmath119 , one can define mixed charge - polarisation asymmetries : @xmath120 @xmath121     polarisation and final state lepton charge  @xcite .",
    "[ fig9 ] ]    fig  [ fig9 ] shows these asymmetries over the @xmath20@xmath104 plane , for cpx scenario , for @xmath112 , for a fixed beam energy .",
    "we see that the size of asymmetries goes as high as @xmath122 and tracks the polarisation asymmetries shown in the earlier figures .",
    "production of the sparticles , at the @xmath12 option  @xcite as well as that at the @xmath94-@xmath68 option  @xcite has been studied .",
    "the interesting thing about charged sparticle production at the @xmath12 colliders is that the cross - sections , to leading order , are entirely determined by their charge and mass , as compared to the case of an @xmath1 collider where the cross - section may depend on the various mixing angles due to the presence of the weak gauge bosons .",
    "this property could provide us complementary information about the models , e.g. , universality of the masses for sleptons and squarks in the 1st and 2nd generations .",
    "it should be emphasized that , as the @xmath123 cross sections involve an @xmath81-wave contribution , they will be much larger than that of @xmath124 if @xmath43 is large compared to the mass threshold . in the @xmath94@xmath68 option , a charged sfermion can be produced in association with a neutral gaugino or vice versa .",
    "if the mass difference between the two is large , then this offers a higher kinematical reach compared to the @xmath1 option .",
    "further , use of polarisation allows to enhance the signal .",
    "again , in this case the dependence of the cross - section on the susy parameters is reduced .",
    "for example , even in the case of ( say ) @xmath125 produced in association with a @xmath126 , the production will involve only the bino component of the @xmath125 .",
    "the threshold dependence of the @xmath127 production may be used for the determination of the sum of the two masses and hence can afford a good determination of the @xmath128 mass  @xcite .",
    "single sneutrino production can be used to study susy at the plc in the r - parity violating scenarios quite effectively  @xcite .",
    "thus we see that a plc can offer a chance of real improvements in the accuracy @xmath129 of @xmath20 measurements at large @xmath20 using @xmath130 fusion .",
    "a plc also provides major gains for the susy higgs sector as it gives a reach for @xmath31 in regions where the lhc does not have any .",
    "further , the @xmath81 channel production mode increases the reach by a factor @xmath131 compared to the @xmath1 option .",
    "the advantages of a @xmath12 collider are even more if cp violation is present .",
    "polarisation asymmetries constructed using initial state photon polarisation and final state fermion polarisations , can be a very good probe of the cp violation in the higgs sector .",
    "lhc / ilc are not very capable when it comes to probing cp - mixing .",
    "the @xmath31 contribution can be probed through mixed polarisation - charge asymmetries , i.e asymmetries in initial state polarisation and final state lepton charge .",
    "if cp violation makes the lightest higgs dominantly pseudoscalar and hence invisible at lep / ilc / lhc then @xmath12 collider is the only place it can be produced for susy searches , @xmath12 and @xmath13 collider can offer some interesting possibilities for sneutrino and gaugino searches ; particularly the production cross - sections are independent of the the different mixing angles for the charged sparticles .",
    "further the high polarisation of the backscattered laser can be put to very good use .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organisers for the wonderful organisation and the atmosphere at the meeting .",

    "<S> in this talk i will begin with a very brief discussion as to why tev scale supersymmetry forms an important subject of the studies at all the current and future colliders . </S>",
    "<S> then , i will give different examples where the photon linear collider , plc , will be able to make unique contributions . </S>",
    "<S> plc s most important role is in the context of higgs physics , due to its ability of accurate determination of @xmath0 as well as the possibilities it offers for the determination of the cp property of the higgs boson and of possible cp mixing in the higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> further , the plc can provide probes of susy in the regions of the susy parameter space , which are either difficult or inaccessible at the lhc and also in the @xmath1 mode of the international linear collider ( ilc ) . </S>"
