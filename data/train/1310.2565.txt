    "at very high temperature and energy density the hadronic matter can turn into a state of deconfined quarks and gluons known as `` quark - gluon plasma '' ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "this state of matter can be created by colliding two large nuclei at ultra - relativistic energies . in such collisions ,",
    "heavy flavours , specially charm and bottom , are produced at the very early stage by the hard scattering and hence can be used to characterize the hot and dense medium .",
    "it is predicted that the production of quarkonia ( charmonia and bottomonia ) in nucleus - nucleus collisions will be suppressed relative to that in proton - proton due to the color - debye screening mechanism  @xcite . in particular , a sequential suppression of quarkonia , depending on their binding energy has been proposed as a thermometer of the deconfined medium  @xcite .    the suppression of quarkonia can be quantified by measuring the nuclear modification factor @xmath6 , which is the ratio of yield in nucleus - nucleus collisions to that in proton - proton collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions .",
    "the suppression of quarkonium states depends on several factors , as the feed - down contributions from higher - mass resonances into the observed quarkonium yield , the b - hadrons decay into charmonium and the quarkonium regeneration due to the q@xmath7 recombination ( expected to be important for c@xmath8 pairs at lhc energies )  @xcite .",
    "other important competing mechanisms are the cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects , such as nuclear shadowing or gluon saturation , which can break the binary scaling even in absence of the qgp .",
    "hence , for the interpretation of results in heavy - ion collisions , data from pa are crucial since they allow to disentangle the cnm effects from those related to the formation of a hot medium . with this goal in mind",
    ", the alice  @xcite collaboration has measured the @xmath0 production in pb - pb collisions at @xmath3 = 2.76  tev and p - pb collisions at @xmath3 = 5.02  tev . for p - pb , data were taken with two beam configurations corresponding to the proton going towards or opposite to the direction of the muon spectrometer ( labelled p - pb and pb - p in the following ) .",
    "a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath9 = 69.2 @xmath10 ( for pb - pb ) , 5.3 @xmath11 ( for p - pb ) and 6.1 @xmath11 ( for pb - p ) have been collected . in pb - pb collisions ,",
    "the measurement of the nuclear modification factor of the inclusive @xmath0 production has been performed in the @xmath12 rapidity range , down to @xmath13 = 0 and in the @xmath14 centrality class at @xmath3 = 2.76  tev .",
    "the integrated @xmath6 value is 0.439@xmath150.065(stat.)@xmath150.028(uncorrelated syst.)@xmath16(correlated syst . ) and implies a significant suppression of inclusive @xmath0 .",

    "fig : raavsnpartandrapidityjpsiandupsilon ] ) .",
    "the interpretation of this observation is not straightforward due to the different amount of feed down from higher mass states and also due to the presence of a recombination contribution for the j/@xmath17 .",

    "our results are also compared with models .",
    "the anisotropic hydro model  @xcite includes feed - down of @xmath0 by higher mass states , but does not include recombination effects nor cold nuclear matter effects .",
