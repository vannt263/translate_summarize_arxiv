    "graph homomorphisms have regained a lot of interest by the recent characterization of grohe of the classes of graphs for which hom@xmath2 is tractable  @xcite . to be precise",
    ", grohe proves that , unless @xmath3 $ ] , deciding whether there is a homomorphism from a graph @xmath4 to some arbitrary graph @xmath1 is polynomial if and only if the graphs in @xmath5 have bounded treewidth modulo homomorphic equivalence .",
    "the treewidth of a graph modulo homomorphic equivalence is defined as the treewidth of its core , ie , a minimal retract .",
    "this , and other recent results ( see eg  @xcite ) , make it desirable to have algorithms that compute cores , or general retracts in graphs .    for any graph @xmath0 ,",
    "all the cores of @xmath0 are isomorphic subgraphs of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , one speaks of _ the core _ of a graph .",
    "however , a fixed copy of the core in @xmath0 is not necessarily a retract .",
    "therefore , when studying retracts or cores one usually assumes that the objective is given as an induced subgraph of @xmath0 .",
    "when restricted to cographs , when @xmath1 is given as an induced subgraph of @xmath0 , it can be determined in linear time whether @xmath1 is a retract .",
    "we prove this is section  [ section partitioned ] .",
    "in the rest of the paper we do not assume that the graph @xmath1 is given as an induced subgraph of @xmath0 . in that case the problem turns out to be np - complete .",
    "we prove that in section  [ section np - c ] .",
    "in this paper we consider the retract problem for cographs .",
    "the related surjective graph homomorphism problem was recently studied in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "it was shown that that the problem to decide whether there is a surjective homomorphism from one connected cograph to another connected cograph is np - complete .",
    "the surjective homomorphism problem is also np - complete if both graphs are unions of complete graphs .",
    "let us mention also the classic result of damaschke , which is that the induced subgraph isomorphism problem is np - complete for cographs  @xcite .",
    "the retract problem for cographs can be perceived as a pattern recognition problem for labeled trees .",
    "many pattern recognition variants have been investigated and classified , see eg ,  @xcite .",
    "this last manuscript @xcite contains references to a lot of the work done on motifs in graphs .",
    "however , the pattern recognition problem that corresponds with the retract problem on cographs seems to have eluded all these investigations  @xcite .",

    "when @xmath1 is a retract of @xmath0 then @xmath1 is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of @xmath0 .",

    "checking if there is a homomorphism @xmath9 is polynomial when @xmath1 is bipartite and it is np - complete otherwise  @xcite .",
    "it follows that , for any graph @xmath1 , checking if a graph @xmath1 is a retract of a graph @xmath0 is np - complete , unless @xmath1 is bipartite .",
    "the problem remains np - complete , even when @xmath1 is an even cycle of length at least six , given as an induced subgraph of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the question whether a graph @xmath0 has a homomorphism to itself which is not the identity is also np - complete  @xcite .",
    "a graph is a cograph if it has no induced @xmath20 , which is the path with four vertices .",
    "since the complement of a @xmath20 is a @xmath20 , cographs are closed under complementation . actually , the class of cographs is the smallest class of graphs which is closed under complementation and taking unions .",
    "a similar characterization of cographs reads as follows .",
    "a graph @xmath0 is a cograph if and only if one of the following holds .    1 .",
    "@xmath0 has only one vertex , or 2 .",
    "@xmath0 is disconnected and every component is a cograph , or 3 .",
    "the complement of @xmath0 , @xmath21 is disconnected and every component of @xmath21 is a cograph .",
    "it follows that cographs have a decomposition tree , called a cotree , defined as follows .",

    "there is a bijection from the leaves of @xmath22 to the vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 has at least two vertices then each internal node of @xmath22 , including the root , is labeled as @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath24 label at a node takes the union of the graphs that correspond with the children of the node .",
    "the @xmath23 label takes the join of the graphs that correspond with the children .    when defined as above , the labels of the internal nodes in any path from the root to a leaf alternate between @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "alternatively , one frequently defines a cotree as a rooted _ binary _ tree , in which each internal node is labeled as @xmath24 and @xmath23 . in this paper ,",
    "when talking about cotrees , we always assume the first type of cotree .",
    "thus , each child of the root corresponds with one component or , with one cocomponent of the graph .",
    "it is well - known that cographs are recognizable in linear time  @xcite .",
    "a cotree has @xmath25 nodes , where @xmath26 , and it can be obtained in linear time .    this paper is organized as follows . in sections  [ section threshold ] and  [ section tp ] we show that the retract problem is polynomial when restricted to the classes of threshold and trivially perfect graphs . in section  [ section np - c ] we show that the problem is np - complete for cographs . in section  [ section",
