    "the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) formalism @xcite was first introduced in condensed - matter physics as a means to systematically set up self - consistent approximations that satisfy conservation laws .",
    "it can be cast in a variational framework where the thermodynamic potential @xmath1 is expressed as a functional of the single - particle green function.@xcite @xmath1 is essentially determined by the luttinger - ward ( lw ) functional @xmath2,@xcite given by the sum of the 2pi feynman diagrams .",
    "@xmath2 is also the generating functional of the self - energy and higher - order 2pi vertices .",
    "the so - called @xmath2-derivable approximations are based on truncations of the diagrammatic expansion of @xmath2 that retain only a finite number or a sub - series of diagrams .",
    "they are thermodynamically consistent and satisfy conservation laws.@xcite while most applications of the 2pi formalism to interacting fermion systems have been limited to the hartree - fock level , recent developments , motivated by the physics of high - temperature superconductors , have incorporated exchange of spin fluctuations within the hubbard model.@xcite following general ideas put forward by wetterich,@xcite the aim of this paper is to discuss a 2pi formulation of the renormalization group ( rg ) approach to interacting fermion systems .    the rg has proven a powerful approach for studying low - dimensional fermion systems , providing a systematic and unbiased method to study competing instabilities in the weak - coupling limit ( refs .  - ) .",
    "one of its main successes has been to explain how unconventional superconductivity can occur at low temperature in systems like organic conductors @xcite or high - temperature superconductors @xcite where the dominant electron - electron interactions are expected to be repulsive and favor antiferromagnetism .",
    "although the rg can be implemented in different ways , most approaches rely on the so - called one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) rg scheme or variants thereof.@xcite the 1pi rg scheme is based on an exact rg equation for the generating functional of 1pi vertices .",
    "the existence of a fermi surface implies that the interaction amplitudes strongly depend on the momenta of the interacting fermions , which leads to functional rg equations for the 1pi vertices .",
    "for this reason , most rg calculations in fermion systems have been limited to one - loop order and are thus restricted to the weak - coupling limit .",
    "another severe limitation of the method comes from the difficulty to access broken - symmetry phases .",
    "long - range order is signaled by a diverging flow of certain 1pi vertices and susceptibilities at a critical energy or temperature scale , below which the rg equations can not be continued .",
    "it has been proposed to circumvent this difficulty by introducing an infinitesimally small symmetry - breaking component in the initial condition of the rg equations,@xcite or combining the rg technique with a mean - field approximation at low energy.@xcite alternatively , one can introduce a partial bosonization of the action yielding a description in terms of both fermionic and collective hubbard - stratonovich fields .",
    "@xcite it will be interesting to further explore the applicability of these new rg schemes in various models .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that broken - symmetry phases can be studied with a rg scheme where the basic quantities are the 2pi vertices rather than their 1pi counterparts . to understand this issue in simple terms ,",

    "theory , this divergence is cured below @xmath10 by the presence of a finite gap in the fermion excitation spectrum . however , in the 1pi rg scheme , it prevents the flow to be straightforwardly@xcite continued into the broken - symmetry phase .",
    "let us now reconsider eq .",
    "( [ ex1 ] ) from a different point of view .",
    "this equation can be seen as a bethe - salpeter equation in the particle - particle channel with the bare interaction @xmath6 as the 2pi vertex @xmath11 ( the reason for this notation will become clear in sec .",

    "the 2pi vertex @xmath11 is therefore not sensitive to the transition into the superconducting phase .",
    "the appearance of long - range order is expected to induce an anomalous ( i.e. symmetry violating ) self - energy below @xmath10 . in more complicated cases , where several types of fluctuations may compete together",
    ", we can not exclude the appearance of singularities in the 2pi vertices .",
    "for instance , in a conductor close to an antiferromagnetic instability , singularities in the particle - particle channel ( i.e. in the particle - particle component of @xmath11 ) may be induced by nearly divergent spin fluctuations .",
    "we shall discuss this point in the concluding section and explain how these singularities can be controlled by a proper parameterization of the vertex .",
    "all these considerations suggest to use a rg scheme where the basic objects are the 2pi vertices .",
