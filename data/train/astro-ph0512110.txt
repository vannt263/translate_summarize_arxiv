    "in the first paper of this series ( * ? ? ? * subsequently referred to as paper i ) we studied the evolution of the circumstellar gas around an isolated 60 @xmath0 star by means of numerical two - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we found that the interaction of the photoionized h region with the stellar wind bubble ( swb ) strongly influences the morphological evolution during the early main - sequence ( ms ) phase of the star . on the one hand ,",
    "the results show that the dynamical interaction processes contribute to the formation of complex structures which can be found in h regions . on the other hand",
    ", these processes also impact on how and to what extent the stellar energy input ( wind and h - ionizing radiation ) is supplied to the interstellar medium ( ism ) , distributed among different forms of energy , and ultimately radiated from the system . while the consideration of the stellar wind strongly enhances the kinetic energy of bulk motion present in the system , ionization energy and the associated thermal energy of warm gas",
    "are generally lowered because the stellar wind intensifies the formation of high - density structures ( clumps ) with shorter hydrogen recombination times and stronger cooling .    with this paper",
    "we continue our numerical analysis of the morphological and energetic influence of massive stars on their ambient ism for a 35 @xmath0 star that evolves from the ms through the red supergiant ( rsg ) and the wolf - rayet ( w - r ) phases until it explodes as a supernova ( sn ) .",
    "the goals of this paper are to examine the combined influence of wind and ionizing radiation on the dynamical evolution of circumstellar matter for this second set of stellar parameters , to compare and contrast the two numerical models we have obtained so far and to compare the model with observations of bubbles around w - r stars that have undergone an rsg phase .",
    "we will complete our little sequence of circumstellar gas models for a 85 @xmath0 star ( d. krger et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) and a 15 @xmath0 star , representing the upper and lower end , respectively , of the stellar mass range that we are investigating .",
    "the remainder of this paper has the following structure : in section [ sec_observations ] we review some recent observations of w - r stars with circumstellar nebulae that are conjectured to be ejected during the rsg phase of the star",
    ". section [ sec_numerics ] briefly reflects on the numerical methods and initial conditions used to produce the results presented in this paper and describes the set of stellar parameters used as time - dependent boundary conditions that drive the evolution .",
    "the results of the model calculations along with a comparison to observations and analytical models are presented in section [ sec_results ] .",
    "we summarize our main results and conclusions in section [ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "from the theoretical point of view , each star that has a supersonic wind with a sufficiently high mass - loss rate should be capable of blowing a swb into the ism .",
    "the crucial indicator for the existence of such swbs is the hot gas produced at the reverse shock",
    ". the x - ray emission of the hot ( @xmath1 ) gas should be detectable if the surface brightness is high enough for the respective telescope in use .",
    "although theory predicts that even massive stars on the ms are supposed to produce swbs , they are expected to be large and diffuse with a low surface brightness in x - rays .",
    "thus , the vicinities of w - r stars seem to be promising candidates for the observation of swbs ( also called w - r bubbles if the central star is in its w - r stage ) . however , only 1/4 to 1/3 of the known galactic w - r stars seem to have associated ring nebulae and only 10 are wind - driven bubbles @xcite , according to the optically derived kinematics of the shell @xcite . up to now only 2 of these swb candidates have actually been detected in x - rays : ngc6888 @xcite and s308 @xcite .",
    "since both central w - r stars are thought to have undergone the ms @xmath2 rsg @xmath2 w - r evolution that we are investigating in this paper , we will briefly review the recent observational work for a careful comparison with our numerical results .",
    "ngc 6888 was among the first galactic ring nebulae whose formation have been attributed to mass ejection and radiation from a w - r star @xcite .",
    "its relative proximity and thus large angular size ( @xmath3 ) has made it to one of the best studied examples of this class of objects . at a distance of 1.45 kpc",
    "@xcite the physical radius of the nebula is 3.8 pc ( major axis ) @xmath4 2.5 pc ( minor axis ) .",
    "the wn6 star hd 192163 (= wr 136 according to the list of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is close to the center of the nebula .",
    "the ellipsoidal shell appears to be geometrically very thin and has a highly filamentary structure . with a mean electron density in the filaments of the nebula of 400 @xmath5 @xcite",
    ", @xcite derived a mass of 5 @xmath0 for the ionized shell and a mean shell thickness of 0.01 pc .",
    "the shell expansion velocity varies among different authors in the range @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is important to distinguish two morphological features that are theoretically expected to evolve during the rsg and w - r stage of the star : a thin and dense `` rsg shell '' forms around the outflowing rsg wind when the reverse shock becomes radiative due to the high density of the wind in this stage .",
    "when the fast w - r wind turns on , the non - radiative reverse shock reestablishes itself and the shocked w - r wind sweeps up the rsg wind in the so - called `` w - r shell '' .",
    "the dynamical age of the w - r shell @xmath7 depends on the expansion velocity and on the assumption of the density profile into which the shell expands .",
    "typically , two cases are considered : a constant ambient density ( @xmath8 according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a @xmath9 density profile ( @xmath10 according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the expansion velocities quoted above , a mean shell radius of 3.2 pc , and the assumption that the optically visible nebula can be associated with the w - r shell , one obtains a minimum value for the dynamical age of ngc 6888 of @xmath11 ( @xmath8 and @xmath12 = @xmath13 ) and a maximum value of @xmath14 ( @xmath10 and @xmath12 = @xmath15 ) .",
    "@xcite used the wfpc2 on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ to examine the filaments of the bright northeast rim of ngc 6888 in the light of the @xmath16 @xmath17 , [ o ] @xmath18 , and [ s ] @xmath19 lines .",
    "they found filament densities of @xmath20 .",
    "the dense shell is enveloped by a skin of emission most evident in [ o ] @xmath18 and it is proposed that this skin arises in a cooling regime behind a radiative shock driven into the medium around the shell . for the low density that is expected in the ms bubble without heat conduction",
    "a forward shock ahead of the nebula shell would not be visible .",
    "thus , the authors propose that a considerable fraction of the approximately 18 @xmath0 rsg wind is possibly present in the ms bubble as a low - density ( @xmath21 ) exterior layer with low @xmath16 surface brightness , visible only in [ o ] @xmath18 postshock emission as the skin engulfing the @xmath16 filaments when it becomes shocked by some combination of nebular shell expansion and the pressure of the postshock w - r wind overtaking the rsg shell . the large discrepancy between the density in the ms bubble of the model and the observed density of the skin",
    "could be explained by thermal evaporation of rsg wind material into the ms bubble .",
    "spectroscopy of the nebular shell shows that the ionized gas is enriched with nitrogen and helium and underabundant in oxygen .",
    "possible explanations might be the transport of chemically enriched material from the core of the star to the outer layers that are ejected during the rsg stage @xcite or the mixing of w - r and rsg wind material @xcite .",
    "the high abundance of nitrogen in the nebula is consistent with the classification of hd 192163 as a wn6 star .",
    "there is some debate on how much neutral gas is present in ngc 6888 .",
    "the answer to this question has implications on the interpretation of the dynamics of the bubble as being either energy or momentum conserving .",
    "@xcite found from _ iras _ observations ( assuming a gas to dust mass ratio of 100 ) a shell of 40 @xmath0 neutral gas directly outside the ionized shell .",
    "the difficulty in the interpretation of the observed data is the correct estimate of the forbidden line contribution in the far infrared .",
    "@xcite concluded that the emission in the _ iras _",
    "60 @xmath22 and 100 @xmath22 bands is predominantly from forbidden [ o ] lines indicating that the continuum emission from the dust and thus the neutral mass would be negligible .",
    "@xcite claims that the flux contribution from forbidden [ o ] and [ n ] lines is only @xmath23% and that the major reason for these deviating results is the higher flux from the nebula which he derived because of a differing background removal procedure .",
    "however , @xcite conclude from their _ hst",
    "_ wfpc2 observations of the nebula that there can not be a significant amount of neutral material close to the optical nebula .",
    "their result for the hydrogen ionizing flux of @xmath24 is in reasonable agreement with the value of @xmath25 from the w - r models of @xcite and does perfectly match the value from @xcite that we use for our calculations presented in this paper , but it is roughly a factor of 50 higher than the lyman continuum flux of @xmath26 which @xcite found as necessary to maintain the observed @xmath16 brightness of the nebula . in other words : only 2% of the ionizing photons from hd 192163 are used to ionize the observable nebular shell of ngc 6888 - it is `` density - bounded '' not `` ionization - bounded '' .",
    "98% would still be available to ionize the neutral parts of the shell . since the shock front ahead of the shell",
    "is partially shadowed from the stellar lyman continuum flux by dense clumps within the shell , it is obvious that there is indeed some neutral material in the shell , but on the other hand the shell is very leaky to lyman continuum photons and it is unlikely that there is as much as 40 @xmath0 neutral gas present directly outside the ionized shell because that would process a larger fraction of the stellar lyman continuum flux into @xmath16 emission .",
    "observational evidence has also been found for the existence of the shell of swept - up ambient ism around the ms bubble .",
    "using highly resolved _ iras _",
    "images @xcite discovered an elliptical shell with average radius of 19 pc ( assuming a distance to hd 192163 of 1.45 kpc ) and mass of @xmath278000  @xmath0 ( assuming a gas to dust mass ratio of 100 ) .",
    "however , this value should be used with some caution since it was obtained with the same techniques that have been applied to produce the controversial result for the amount of neutral mass contained in the w - r bubble .",
    "ngc 6888 was the first swb that has been observed in x - rays @xcite .",
    "the latter authors examined the x - ray emission from ngc 6888 using the pspc detector of the _ rosat _ satellite and found that it is filamentary and concentrated in the brightest optical features of the nebula .",
    "70% of the total x - ray emission originates from only @xmath28 of the bubble volume . with their assumed distance",
    "to ngc 6888 of 1.8 kpc the x - ray luminosity is estimated to be @xmath29 in the energy band @xmath30 kev and the plasma temperature to be @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite also used the hri detector on board the _ rosat _ satellite to obtain x - ray emission maps with higher spatial resolution .",
    "they conclude that approximately half of the total x - ray emission originates from small filaments with typical size of a few tenths of a pc and typical luminosity in the _ rosat _ hri band of several @xmath32 , corresponding to a hydrogen number density in the filaments of a few @xmath5 . @xcite",
    "also examined the possibility that the emission of these filaments is produced by clumps of dense gas which evaporate in the bubble of hot gas .",
    "they find that this explanation could only be consistent with the observations if the bubble gas is sufficiently hot ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "s308 surrounding the wn4 star hd 50896 (= ez cma = wr 6 ) is the second swb that has been observed in x - rays .",
    "the optically visible nebula is characterized by an almost spherically symmetric shell with a remarkable protrusion in the northwest quadrant but otherwise with no hints on the formation of pronounced instabilities .",
    "the distance to s308 and thus all quantities which scale with the distance are somewhat uncertain . @xcite give @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite found that the range from 0.9 to a few kpc is in agreement with the results of their spectral analysis , with a preferred value of 2 kpc .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath35 with an uncertainty of 15% based on their high - resolution observations of the interstellar na d lines in the spectra of hd 50896 and several nearby stars .",
    "measurements with the _ hipparcos _ satellite indicated @xmath36 @xcite , which seems to be unreasonably close , when compared with the other distance - estimate techniques .",
    "the photometric distance to hd 50896 is @xmath37 @xcite and the kinematic distance based on radial velocity information ( of s308 and neighboring h regions ) and galactic rotation is @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we will subsequently use a distance of 1.5 kpc and all the distance - depending values that we quote from other papers are scaled accordingly .",
    "the radius of the optically visible shell is 9 pc and the shell expands with @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the ionized mass of the shell is 54 @xmath0 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* scaled according to the values of radius and expansion velocity used here ) .",
    "the derived average hydrogen number density of the ambient gas that has been swept up is thus @xmath270.6  @xmath5 .",
    "an interesting implication of the distance and position on the sky is that s308 lies approximately 260 pc above the galactic plane , an unusual place for a massive star .",
    "since hd 50896 also has a compact companion , possibly the stellar remnant of a sn explosion , it has been proposed that it is a runaway star @xcite . however , because the location of hd 50896 is almost central within s308 the transverse velocity of hd 50896 with respect to its shell can not be very high . for an adopted dynamical age of the nebula of 0.14 myr",
    "@xcite the star can reach its projected displacement from the center of the bubble with a velocity of less than @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "there is no morphological evidence for supersonic transverse motion of the star + shell system with respect to its local ism .",
    "@xcite used the _ rosat _ pspc detector to examine the x - ray emission from s308 . despite some technical difficulties he found that the observed spectrum can be fitted by a two - temperature emission model , one component at @xmath41 and the second at @xmath42 .",
    "a total luminosity of @xmath43 ( scaled to the distance of @xmath34 ) in the energy band between 0.1 kev and 2.04 kev has been determined .",
    "the emitting volume is probably a thick shell with a ratio of inner to outer radius @xmath270.5 .",
    "one of the major conclusions of @xcite regarding the theoretical models is that s308 can not be described by either the @xcite constant ambient density model or by the two - wind model of @xcite .",
    "a comparable bubble produced within the two - wind framework would have an x - ray luminosity of @xmath44 , which is roughly in agreement with the observed value ( bearing in mind the uncertainty in the determination of the observed x - ray luminosity ) .",
    "the problem is that the stellar wind luminosity which is necessary to reproduce the bubble in the model is only @xmath273% of the stellar wind luminosity that @xcite derived for hd 50896 ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , scaled to the distance of @xmath34 used here ) .",
    "even if the lower clumping - corrected mass - loss rate of @xcite is used to derive the mechanical wind luminosity , the value from the model is still almost an order of magnitude lower .",
    "this is called the `` missing wind problem '' .",
    "moreover , the observed x - ray surface brightness profile of s308 is limb brightened while the theoretical profile is centrally filled .",
    "the result for the classical bubble model according to @xcite is similar : although the stellar wind luminosity needed to reproduce the observed bubble kinematics is higher than in the two - wind model of @xcite , it is still only @xmath278% of the observed value ( @xmath2732% for the clumping - corrected mass - loss rate ) .",
    "@xcite observed the x - ray emission from the northwest quadrant of s308 using the epic ccd cameras of the _ xmm - newton _ satellite .",
    "they found that the x - ray emission is completely interior to the optical shell and reconfirmed the limb brightening .",
    "the brightest x - ray emitting regions are linked to bright optical filaments .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity of s308 , extrapolated from the observed flux from the northwest quadrant , is @xmath47 in the energy band between 0.25 kev and 1.5 kev .",
    "the observed spectrum can be fitted with the emission of an optically thin , nitrogen - enriched plasma of temperature @xmath48 .",
    "this is quite `` cool '' compared to the postshock temperature of order @xmath49 k which is expected for a rare stellar wind with terminal velocity of a few @xmath50 and might indicate that the shocked w - r wind has mixed with cold gas by the processes of thermal evaporation and/or dynamic ablation .",
    "the spectrum is very soft so that there is basically no emission beyond 1 kev .",
    "the existence of a high - temperature gas component that substantially contributes to the observed emission and that has been claimed to be detected by @xcite is ruled out .",
    "less than 6% of the observed x - ray flux ( which corresponds to 1.5% of the unabsorbed x - ray flux ) can be attributed to the emission of a hotter gas component .",
    "the reason for these contradicting results is probably the low signal - to - noise ratio in the _ rosat _ pspc data that @xcite obtained together with a number of point sources which have not been resolved by the pspc detector . since the [ o ] @xmath18 emission of s308 has a sharp rim ,",
    "the nebular shell is probably still surrounded by unaffected rsg wind material .",
    "this rsg material can not extend too much farther out , if the protrusion in the northwest quadrant is interpreted as a first blowout .",
    "there is a gap between the outer rim of the [ o ] @xmath18 emission and the outer edge of the x - ray emission of between 90 arcsec to over 200 arcsec , corresponding to @xmath51 pc .",
    "@xcite interpret this gap as being filled by the w - r shell and probably a transition layer .",
    "this is also indicated by the detection of an interstellar n absorption line toward hd 50896 , which @xcite attribute to the shell of s308 .    the electron density in the x - ray emitting gas is estimated to be @xmath52 or @xmath53 for an assumed hot gas volume filling factor of 0.5 or 0.1 , respectively .",
    "the filling factor is expected to be closer to 0.5 since the limb - brightened x - ray emission profile suggests emission from a thick shell .",
    "the resulting mass of the x - ray emitting gas is @xmath54 or @xmath55 for the two volume filling factors . assuming that the optical emission which has been used to determine the expansion velocity comes from the w - r shell , the age of the w - r phase can be estimated using equation [ eq_t_dyn ] . for @xmath56 = 9 pc , @xmath12 = @xmath57 , and @xmath10 this yields @xmath58 = 0.14 myr .",
    "for a clumping - corrected mass - loss rate of hd 50896 of @xmath59 ( * ? ?",
    "* scaled to the distance used here ) the mass blown into the bubble by the w - r wind is 2 @xmath0 .",
    "this is less than the x - ray emitting gas mass , a fact which in turn supports the idea that rsg material is mixed with the shocked w - r wind in the bubble or that the main source of x - rays is different from the shocked w - r wind .",
    "observations of s308 in the optical waveband furthermore show that besides photoionization there is also shock heating present , indicated by the high [ o ] @xmath18/@xmath60 ratio of 20 @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of ngc 6888 , the [ o ] @xmath18 emission leads the @xmath16 emission by 16 - 20 arcsec @xcite corresponding to @xmath61 pc . furthermore",
    ", s308 is located in an h cavity swept free by the ms wind of hd 50896 @xcite .",
    "the numerical code used to obtain the results presented in this paper is described in @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamical equations are solved together with the transfer of h - ionizing photons on a two - dimensional cylindrical grid .",
    "the time dependent ionization and recombination of hydrogen is calculated each time step and we carefully take stock of all the important energy exchange processes in the system . for a closer description of the algorithm",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we use the same undisturbed background gas layer with hydrogen number density @xmath62 and temperature @xmath63 for the reasons described in @xcite and start our calculations with the sudden turn - on of the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) stellar radiation field and stellar wind .",
    "after @xmath64 the spherical one - dimensional solution is used as initial model for the two - dimensional calculations .      the basic difference between the 60 @xmath0 case described in @xcite and the 35 @xmath0 case is the set of time - dependent stellar parameters .",
    "the mass - loss rate ( @xmath65 ) , terminal velocity of the wind ( @xmath66 ) , effective temperature ( @xmath67 ) , and photon luminosity in the lyman continuum ( @xmath68 ) drive the evolution of the circumstellar gas .",

    "after @xmath72 the calculation stops and the star explodes as a sn .    during the star s",
    "ms phase the mass - loss rate rises approximately from @xmath73 to @xmath74 . with the onset of the rsg phase the mass - loss rate jumps up to almost @xmath75 . in the final w - r phase it is of the order @xmath76",
    "the terminal velocity of the stellar wind on the ms is between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , during the rsg phase it drops below @xmath79 until it again reaches values of @xmath80 in the final w - r phase .",
    "the effective temperature during the ms phase lies in the range of @xmath81 , falls down to a few thousand kelvin in the rsg phase and temporarily reaches more than @xmath82 during the final w - r phase . while the total photon luminosity of the star is relatively constant with values of @xmath83 during the whole evolution of the star , the photon luminosity in the lyman continuum and the mechanical luminosity of the wind reflect the strong changes of mass - loss rate , terminal velocity of the wind and effective temperature .",
    "the lyman continuum luminosity during the ms is in the range of @xmath84 . in the course of the rsg phase it is insignificant due to the strong decrease of the effective temperature .",
    "the inverse situation occurs during the subsequent w - r phase : because of the high effective temperature , most of the radiative power is emitted above the lyman edge and the lyman continuum luminosity reaches almost @xmath85 .",
    "the mechanical wind luminosity ( @xmath86 ) during the ms phase is @xmath87 , drops by approximately one order of magnitude during the rsg phase , and reaches the highest values between @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the final w - r phase .    here , the radius of the `` wind generator region '' is @xmath90 .",

    "the size of the coarsest mesh , representing the size of the computational domain , is @xmath91 .",

    "similar to @xcite we performed a resolution study for the 35 @xmath0 case to ensure that the spatial resolution is high enough and that the numerical results are trustworthy .",
    "the same selection of parameters was calculated with three different resolutions , medium ( 125 cells in each dimension ) , low ( 61 cells in each dimension ) , and high ( 253 cells in each dimension ) .",

    "; the period of time they were present in the stellar wind shell was relatively short .",
    "thus , the shadows in the h region are much less pronounced and the finger - like extensions of the h region are shorter and less numerous than for the 60 @xmath0 case . nevertheless , density fluctuations in the h region of more than an order of magnitude have been produced .",
    "( this may be a lower limit because of restrictions in resolution . )",
    "maximum densities are around @xmath112 and minima around @xmath113 . at these densities , temperatures , and masses",
    "the clumps are not gravitationally bound .",
    "the dissolution of the stellar wind shell can impressively be seen in figure [ ion_uchii_apj230.041.001.3.med.mono.eps ] at @xmath114 .",
    "the expansion of the stellar wind shell has become a 2 pc broad belt of outflow with density @xmath115 from the contact discontinuity at @xmath116 into the h region with about sound speed .",
    "additional processes are triggered by the rarefaction of the gas that previously belonged to the stellar wind shell : because of the increase of hydrogen recombination time with lower density , excess photons are generated which reionize the shadowed regions ( see lower panel of figure [ ion_uchii_apj230.041.001.3.med.mono.eps ] ) and advance the ionization front even further , evaporating additional material from the h region shell of swept - up ambient medium ahead .",
    "this evaporation is visible in the density increase and the disturbed velocity field in the outer parts of the h region close to the ionization front . as a transient phenomenon",
    ", another shell with a density of @xmath117 develops at @xmath118 when the former stellar wind shell gas flowing into the h region collides with the photoevaporated material from this swept - up ambient shell .",
    "together with the relics of denser fragments in the h region , the larger opacity in this dense shell causes once again the formation of small ripples in the ionization front at @xmath119 ( figure [ ion_uchii_apj230.048.002.3.med.mono.eps ] ) . at this time the radius of the hot bubble is about 7.5",
    "pc and the geometrical thickness of the whole h region is about 4 pc .",
    "however , the newly formed shell soon dissolves because of its overpressure with respect to the rest of the h region , and within certain limits it can thus be said that the dissolution of the stellar wind shell leads to a `` rehomogenization '' of the h region .",
    "if we continue our analysis of this case to @xmath120 ( figure [ ion_uchii_apj230.063.002.2.med.mono.eps ] , please note the different scale ) , we see that the hot bubble has grown to almost 10 pc in radius .",
    "the shell - like h region , still expanding into the ambient medium at about @xmath107 , becomes more and more homogeneous .",
    "nevertheless , remaining density fluctuations from the previous formation and destruction processes are still in the range from @xmath121 to @xmath122 .",
    "we compare the morphological characteristics of the circumstellar gas which result from our runs with different resolution after 1 myr in figure [ ion_uchii_apj230.092.002.2.med.mono.eps ] ( high resolution ) and figure [ ion_uchii_apj229.404.001.2.med.mono.eps ] ( medium resolution ) .",
    "as can be expected the overall structure in both runs is the same .",
    "the radius of the shell of swept - up ambient gas around the h region is @xmath2717 pc and it expands at almost @xmath107 .",
    "the geometrical thickness of the h region itself is slightly larger in the high - resolution run , the velocity field in the h region is stronger perturbed than in the medium - resolution run , and some fragments of the photoionized gas protrude and get mixed into the hot gas .",
    "all the latter deviations can be understood in terms of the finer substructures in the h region , which were able to form in the high - resolution run .",
    "however , the trend toward a rehomogenization of the h region continues : the density fluctuations in the h region are only in the range of @xmath123 to @xmath124 , except for very small regions at the inner side of the shell of swept - up ambient gas . here",
    "the density is reduced after neutral clumps from the shell have been evaporated `` explosively '' . subsequently for @xmath125 we consider only the medium - resolution model .",
    "since the stellar parameters vary only very gradually during the ms phase until the star enters the rsg stage ( see figure [ 35msun_input4apj_up.eps ] ) , the basic structure of the swb / h region remains the same during the next 3 myr except that it continues to grow .",
    "thus , we can proceed with our description of the evolution to figure [ ion_uchii_apj229.942.003.1.med.mono.eps ] , which shows the bubble at the age of 4 myr ( please note once again the larger scale ) .",
    "the radius of the hot bubble is now about 27 pc and the h region extends out to @xmath2735 pc .",
    "the hot bubble and the photoionized h region are in pressure equilibrium ; as the pressure of the hot bubble decreases through expansion , the pressure of the h region drops , too . because the temperature in the h region is nearly constant in time",
    ", the density has decreased to @xmath126 .",
    "a few dense clumps are visible in the hot bubble which have detached from the h region .",
    "the thermal pressure of the swb / h region is still @xmath2720 times higher than that of the ambient medium and the whole structure still expands at about @xmath127 . as a result of the additionally swept - up material , the reduced pressure in the h region , and the deceleration of the expansion ,",
    "the geometrical thickness of the outer shell has increased to almost 3 pc while its density has decreased to @xmath128 .",
    "thus , the mass collected in this shell is about @xmath129 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the picture that most of the ambient gas that has been swept up during the expansion since the ionization front turned to d - type is still stored in the outer shell and that only a minor fraction has been evaporated into the h region .    at @xmath130",
    "the star enters the rsg phase .",
    "the effective temperature of the star decreases to a few thousand kelvin and the lyman continuum flux drops by many orders of magnitude .",
    "the mass - loss rate strongly increases and the terminal velocity of the wind decreases ; i.e. , the star blows a dense and slow wind into the hot bubble .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ ion_uchii_apj229.960.017.1.med.mono.eps ] , which depicts the state of the circumstellar gas at @xmath131 . at this time the dense rsg wind fills",
    "the inner 5 pc of the volume and expands at about @xmath132 into the hot bubble extending out to about 30 pc .",
    "although the wind speed during the rsg phase is relatively low ( compared to the ms and w - r phases ) , the material becomes shocked when it is decelerated by the pressure of the ms bubble because the sound speed in the rsg wind is also low .",
    "( the gas is cold and neutral , or even molecular , because the soft stellar radiation field in the rsg phase is incapable of ionizing and heating it . )",
    "since the density of the rsg wind is fairly high , this reverse shock is radiative and forms the very thin and dense rsg shell , which is not completely resolved in our calculation ( compare to * ? ? ?",
    "* the case of the fast rsg wind ) .",
    "because of the reduction of lyman continuum flux , the hydrogen in the former h region between @xmath133 starts to recombine .",
    "the degree of hydrogen ionization drops to @xmath27 0.3 as the gas cools from about 6600 k at @xmath134 to 4800 k. thus , the thermal pressure in the ( former ) h region drops significantly , leading to a further broadening and slowing down of the outer shell of swept - up ambient medium , which at this time has a thickness of about 3 pc and a velocity of @xmath274  @xmath108 .",
    "the transition from the rsg phase of the star to the w - r phase occurs at @xmath135 . in the w - r phase",
    "the mass - loss rate is somewhat lower than in the rsg stage ( see figure [ 35msun_input4apj_up.eps ] ) , but the terminal velocity of the w - r wind is much higher ( a few thousand @xmath108 ) .",
    "the mechanical luminosity of the w - r wind is thus much higher than that of the rsg wind . because of the increase of effective temperature to about @xmath82",
    ", the stellar photon output occurs largely beyond the lyman continuum limit ; the star s lyman continuum luminosity @xmath136 is higher than during the ms phase of the star .",
    "figure [ ion_uchii_apj229.962.006.1.med.mono.eps ] shows the structure of the circumstellar gas at @xmath137 , some @xmath138 after the start of the w - r wind .",

    "the expansion of the hot gas sweeps up the slow rsg wind in the w - r shell .",
    "the expansion velocity of the w - r shell is high , almost @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , a strong shock ahead of the w - r shell heats the rsg wind material and the w - r shell is thick ( of the order 1 pc ) and hot ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "figure [ ion_uchii_apj229.962.006.1.med.mono.eps ] pinpoints the moment when the w - r shell and the rsg shell collide so that only one shell of swept - up rsg wind is visible within the ms bubble ( see * ? ? ?",
    "( the shell distortion at the @xmath141-axis is a result of the dense clump that has been there before . )",
    "stellar lyman continuum photons ionize the rsg wind gas ( before it is shock heated by the w - r shell ) and reionize the former h region , which can be seen by comparison of the lower panels of figures [ ion_uchii_apj229.960.017.1.med.mono.eps ] and [ ion_uchii_apj229.962.006.1.med.mono.eps ] .",
    "as long as the w - r shell moves through the rsg wind material , the thermal pressure of the shocked w - r wind inside the w - r shell is counterbalanced by the ram pressure of the rsg material it sweeps up .",
    "when the shock passes over the boundary between the rsg and ms winds and moves into the lower density medium , it speeds up as a rarefaction wave travels back into the w - r shell .",
    "it is the overpressure of the shocked rarefied w - r gas which is accelerating the much denser w - r shell .",
    "this is the classical case of a rayleigh - taylor unstable configuration and the w - r shell is torn into long filaments as the shocked w - r wind breaks through it .",

    "this value is somewhat uncertain , however , due to the very complex flow pattern .",
    "the freely flowing wind is surrounded by the hot bubble that extends out to @xmath144 pc ( on average 34 pc ) .",
    "the gas density in the hot bubble is @xmath145 .",
    "this is fairly high ( compared to the density at the end of the ms phase of the star ) because some of the rsg / w - r ejecta mixes with the hot bubble gas , enhancing the density significantly and lowering the temperature .",
    "the thickness of the shell - like h region has shrunk to @xmath146 pc with an average of 5.5 pc , after the rsg ejecta hit it and the pressure in the hot bubble has risen .",
    "this also enhances the density in the h region to @xmath147 .",
    "the higher spread is a result of the higher w - r lyman continuum flux ( compared to the ms phase ) , leading to increased photoevaporation of the swept - up ambient material .",
    "finally , the shell of swept - up ambient gas is @xmath148 pc thick and the gas density in the shell is @xmath149 .",
    "the expansion velocity of this shell is @xmath150 and therefore still supersonic with respect to the cold ambient ism .",
    "the outermost shock moving into the ism heats the swept - up ism gas to almost @xmath151 .",
    "thus , the whole structure extends out to a distance of @xmath152 pc from the star at this evolutionary time .",
    "we discuss the energization of the circumstellar gas around the 35 @xmath0 star on the basis of figure [ e_distri229apj_up.eps ] and compare it with its counterpart for the 60 @xmath0 case ( figure 17 in @xcite ) .",
    "the plot shows selected energy contributions in the circumstellar gas as a function of time , namely the kinetic energy of bulk motion in the whole computational domain , the ionization energy ( 13.6 ev per ionized hydrogen atom ) , the thermal energy of cold ( @xmath153 ) , warm ( @xmath154 ) , and hot ( @xmath155 ) gas , respectively .",
    "the ionization energy dominates after several thousand years , when the ionization front reaches the strmgren radius . here",
    ", it attains a value of approximately @xmath156 , which is about half an order of magnitude less than for the 60 @xmath0 case due to the lower lyman continuum luminosity of the 35 @xmath0 star .",
    "the subsequent dip in ionization energy is much less pronounced than for the 60 @xmath0 case , since at that time there is less structure formation in the h region , as is evident in figures [ ion_uchii_apj230.030.001.3.med.mono.eps ] through [ ion_uchii_apj230.048.002.3.med.mono.eps ] .",
    "afterward , the ionization energy rises smoothly to @xmath157 before the star enters the rsg stage . during the rsg stage the ionization energy drops by an order of magnitude since the h - ionizing radiation from the star",
    "is completely switched off and the photoionized gas recombines .",
    "the gas is reionized when the star evolves to the w - r phase ; the ionization energy reaches a global maximum of @xmath158 .",
    "contrary to the 60 @xmath0 case , the ionization energy remains the dominant form of energy in the system for the entire evolution except for a brief period at the end of the rsg phase .    a feature which we already described for the 60 @xmath0 case",
    "can also be seen in the 35 @xmath0 case : the evolution of the thermal energy of warm gas follows that of the ionization energy over the lifetime of the star with a shift of @xmath159 dex due to the fact that for both cases , photoionization is responsible for the bulk production of ionized gas at typically 8000 k. the shift is smaller during the rsg phase of the star because cooling is less efficient in the formerly photoionized regimes when the hydrogen recombines and the plasma becomes neutral .",
    "the evolution of the kinetic energy of bulk motion and the thermal energy of hot gas are also very similar ; they do not deviate from each other by more than 0.2 dex until the star enters the rsg phase . whereas the kinetic energy remains basically constant during the rsg phase , the thermal energy of hot gas decreases as the supply of hot gas by the reverse shock dies off .",
    "the cooling of the hot gas and mixing with cooler gas continues .",
    "both values rise when the non - radiative reverse shock reestablishes itself in the w - r phase . when the calculations are stopped , the kinetic energy is @xmath160 and the thermal energy of hot gas @xmath161 ; the latter value is almost the same as at the end of the 60 @xmath0 calculation at 4.065 myr .",
    "the thermal energy of cold quiescent gas in the entire computational domain at the beginning of the calculation is @xmath162 ( the same energy density as in the 60 @xmath0 case , but with a smaller computational volume ) .",
    "this value grows smoothly during the lifetime of the star as more and more ambient gas becomes swept up and weakly shocked by the outer shell .",
    "the thermal energy of the cold gas at the end of the calculation is @xmath163 ; i.e. , @xmath164 have been added during the evolution .",
    "to study the impact of the stellar wind on the energy transfer in the circumstellar gas , we compare the energy in the system as a function of time for the two cases : 1 ) the standard case with wind and 2 ) the h region evolution without wind ( figure [ e_with_without_wind35apj_up.eps ] , see also figure 18 in @xcite ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of bulk motion is enhanced due to the added kinetic energy of the stellar wind shell . on the other hand ,",
    "the compression of the h region into a shell with higher density reduces the amount of ionization energy stored in the system compared to the windless case .",
    "thus , the ratio of ionization energy for the calculation with wind to that of the windless model is below 1 throughout the lifetime of the star .",
    "both features are well recognized from the 60 @xmath0 case . in general , the deviations of the energies between the models with and without stellar wind are smaller in the 35 @xmath0 case , especially during the ms evolution . for most of the ms time",
    "the ratios are well within the interval @xmath165 .",
    "this difference to the 60 @xmath0 case exists because the ratio of mechanical luminosity to lyman continuum luminosity of the 35 @xmath0 star is smaller than that of the 60 @xmath0 star .",
    "there is a drop in the ratio of the ionization energies with and without wind during the rsg phase of the star . at first glance ,",
    "this is surprising since in the calculation with stellar wind there is additional ionization energy in the hot bubble .",
    "but the density in the hot bubble is very low and although the thermal energy of the hot gas in the bubble is important , there is not much ionization energy involved .",
    "the reason for the drop in the ratio of the ionization energies with and without wind is the fact that in the calculation with wind the h region is compressed into a shell surrounding the hot bubble and the density in this shell is higher than in the spherical h region of the windless simulation . the higher density results in shorter recombination times and thus a faster loss of ionization energy when the lyman continuum radiation of the star ceases at the beginning of the rsg phase .    due to the acceleration of the slow rsg wind by the shocked w - r wind",
    ", there is a strong peak in the ratio of the kinetic energies with and without wind .",
    "this additional kinetic energy is partially dissipated when the accelerated rsg wind material hits the h region . at the end of the simulation the kinetic energy in the calculation with stellar wind",
    "is enhanced by 85% , whereas the ionization energy is reduced by 34% , and the thermal energy that is added to the system during the evolution is increased by 88% compared to the calculation without stellar wind .",
    "one of the goals of this work is to determine the efficiencies with which the stellar input energy is converted into the different forms of energy in the circumstellar medium .",
    "we show these values for the 35 @xmath0 case in figure [ ecompare229apj_up.eps ] ( compare figure 21 in @xcite ) .",
    "we recall here that we define the transfer efficiency as the cumulative fraction of the stellar input energy that has been converted into a particular form of energy in the circumstellar medium up to the time @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the age of the star .",
    "figure [ ecompare229apj_up.eps ] shows the transfer efficiencies into kinetic , ionization , and thermal energy and their sum for the 35 @xmath0 case .",
    "as we have already seen in figure [ e_distri229apj_up.eps ] , the energization of the circumstellar gas occurs fairly smoothly until the star reaches the rsg stage .",
    "the transfer efficiency into kinetic energy reaches @xmath168 before and during the rsg phase and peaks up to @xmath169 when the shocked w - r wind accelerates the rsg wind . at the end of the simulation",
    "it is @xmath170 .",
    "the transfer efficiency into thermal energy is higher than that into kinetic energy by a factor of 2 to 3 during most of the ms time .",
    "it reaches @xmath171 before the rsg phase , drops by almost a factor of 2 during the rsg phase , rises again when the star enters the w - r stage , and ends up at @xmath172 at the end of the simulation .",
    "the transfer efficiency into ionization energy is the highest except during the rsg stage of the star . before the rsg phase it is @xmath173 and at the end of the simulation it is @xmath174 .",
    "the total energy transfer efficiency ( into kinetic , thermal , and ionization energy ) at the end of the simulation is @xmath175 ; i.e. , 1% of the total input energy from the star is transferred to the circumstellar gas .",
    "this is comparable to the net efficiency of the windless simulation .",
    "this result shows that , globally speaking , the role of the stellar wind is less important than for the 60 @xmath0 case where its presence doubled the total energy transfer efficiency at the end of the calculation .",
    "however , the total energy transfer efficiency at the end of the 35 @xmath0 calculation is 2.7 times as high as for the 60 @xmath0 case . since the circumstellar energy in the 35 @xmath0 case",
    "is dominated by ionization energy , a substantial fraction will be lost quickly when the star ultimately turns off . on the other hand ,",
    "the sn will inject a huge amount of additional energy into the circumstellar gas .",
    "both processes are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we summarize the values of the individual energy components ( @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 ) at the end of the 35 @xmath0 simulations with and without stellar wind in table [ table_num_results ] .",
    "the values of the energy transfer efficiency into kinetic energy ( @xmath181 ) , ionization energy ( @xmath182 ) , thermal energy ( @xmath183 ) , and their sum ( @xmath184 ) at the end of the 35 @xmath0 simulations with and without stellar wind are given in table [ table_num_eff ] .",
    "for comparison purposes the corresponding 60 @xmath0 results from @xcite are also given there . during the lifetime of the 35 @xmath0 star , the total energy emitted in the lyman continuum is @xmath185 and the mechanical energy of the stellar wind amounts to @xmath186 .",
    "taking mean values for the relevant stellar parameters over the lifetime of the 35 @xmath0 star , we can calculate the kinetic , ionization , and thermal energy in the system according to the analytical solutions given in  2 of @xcite .",
    "with @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and using @xmath189 as hydrogen recombination coefficient and @xmath190 for the isothermal sound speed in the h region ( corresponding to @xmath191 ) , we obtain for @xmath62 after @xmath192 from equations ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) in @xcite for the 35 @xmath0 case without wind : @xmath193 with the same definition of the energy transfer efficiency according to equation ( 11 ) in @xcite we get the corresponding energy transfer efficiencies in the analytical approach : @xmath194    the analytical value for the transfer efficiency into kinetic energy deviates from the numerical result by less than 2% .",
    "bearing in mind all the approximations which were made in order to obtain the analytical solution , it is clear that the almost perfect correspondence between analytical and numerical result is certainly by chance .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the numerical value for @xmath181 is almost constant during most of the ms and rsg lifetime , but jumps up by @xmath2740% during the final w - r stage .",
    "analytical and numerical results for the transfer efficiency into thermal energy show fairly good correspondence immediately before the rsg phase ( not shown here ) , but since the final w - r stage boosts the thermal energy and thus also the transfer efficiency into thermal energy , the final value deviates from the analytical one by approximately a factor of 2 . the comparison of analytical and numerical results for the transfer efficiency into ionization energy bears similar results .",
    "the values are fairly close to each other before the star turns to the rsg stage , and the deviation at the end of the simulation is also only @xmath2730% .    as we have already discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the comparison of analytical with numerical results is much more difficult in the case of the combined swb / h region calculation because no analytical solution is yet known for energy transfer efficiencies in the case of h regions with stellar winds .",
    "again , we construct an analytical approximation by simply adding up the energy contributions from the h region and the swb , bearing in mind that this is only a rough estimation which actually neglects the mutual interactions . in any case",
    "the analytical energy transfer efficiencies into kinetic and thermal energy are upper limits , since cooling in the hot bubble is not considered in the analytical approach .",
    "equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) from @xcite yield the kinetic and thermal energy for the swb only . inserting the mean value of the mechanical wind luminosity , @xmath195 , and adding up the results for the pure h region , we obtain @xmath196 related to the sum of lyman continuum radiation energy and mechanical wind energy ( which is almost negligible for the 35 @xmath0 star ) , we get the corresponding energy transfer efficiencies according to equation ( 12 ) in @xcite : @xmath197 comparing these values with the results of the analytical solution for the windless case and the simulations with and without wind , one can see that the increase of the kinetic energy deposit from the windless to the combined swb / h region simulation ( almost doubled ) as well as the increase of the thermal energy deposit ( also almost doubled ) is about a factor of 3 below the analytical upper limits .",
    "in section [ sec_observations ] we point out the importance of x - ray observations of the hot gas in swbs to study the physics of swbs .",
    "thus , we have examined the x - ray properties of our numerical model . in figure [ l_x_plot229_0.1 - 2.4kev_s308apj_up.eps ]",
    "we plot the total x - ray luminosity of our model bubble in the energy band @xmath198 kev as a function of time .",
    "the emissivity @xmath199 in each grid cell is calculated with the @xcite program . for temperatures below @xmath82",
    "the emissivity is set to zero .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity at time @xmath200 is calculated as @xmath201 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 are the plasma density and temperature in the grid cell , respectively , @xmath204 is the volume of the grid cell , and @xmath205 the energy of the x - ray photons . for the summation over grid cells the finest grid that is available for the respective coordinates",
    "is always used . as for the calculation of all the other global quantities ,",
    "the grid data are mirrored at the equator .",
    "we assume optically thin emission ; absorption is neglected .",
    "for the set of chemical abundances , @xmath206 , we use the same values which @xcite used for their spectral x - ray fits of s308 and which are based on the abundance determination of @xcite for the optically visible shell .",
    "we assume that the elements not mentioned by @xcite have the same abundance relative to the solar value as oxygen ( 0.13 ) .",
    "thus , for the computation of the x - ray emissivity the following elements are considered : h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , ni with the following abundances relative to the solar values @xcite : 1.0 , 2.1 , 0.1 , 1.6 , 0.13 , 0.22 , 0.13 , 0.13 , 0.13 , 0.13 , 0.13 , 0.13 , 0.13 . this set of elemental abundances is intended to represent the chemistry in the rsg wind .",
    "the composition of the hot gas in the ms bubble may be different because the radiating material is supposed to originate from the ms wind of the star and ( if thermal evaporation or ablation is important ) also from the ambient medium .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity we use the same chemical composition for all the emitting gas during the whole evolution .",
    "we will briefly discuss impacts of this choice below .",
    "the chemical composition employed for this diagnostic purpose is thus inconsistent with the solar chemical composition that is used to calculate the cooling of the gas ( energy sink term in the radiation - hydrodynamical equations ) .",
    "figure [ l_x_plot229_0.1 - 2.4kev_s308apj_up.eps ] shows that the x - ray luminosity assumes the value @xmath207 soon after the turn on of the stellar wind .",
    "it remains remarkably constant during the ms phase and the associated growth of the swb .",
    "the deviation from @xmath207 is less than a factor of 2.5 during this period .",
    "most of the x - ray emission originates at the interface between the hot gas in the swb and the swept - up h shell .",
    "although he and n are overabundant , the strong underabundance of the other metals reduces the x - ray luminosity .",
    "using a solar chemical composition instead of the abundances described above would increase the luminosity in figure [ l_x_plot229_0.1 - 2.4kev_s308apj_up.eps ] by a factor @xmath148 . with the onset of the rsg phase the total x - ray luminosity decreases by a factor of @xmath148 until the star reaches the w - r stage .",
    "this happens because the hot gas ( or more precisely the gas in the interface region close to the shell of swept - up ambient gas ) cools and the supply of the bubble with hot gas ceases during the rsg phase .",
    "the subsequent onset of the fast w - r wind drives up the total x - ray luminosity by approximately 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "it reaches a few times @xmath208 , but varies quite strongly .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this phase almost all of the x - ray emission comes from the w - r shell ( instead of the shocked w - r wind ) . at @xmath209",
    "the radius of this x - ray emitting shell is approximately 10 pc with a thickness of @xmath210 pc .",
    "the temperature drops from @xmath211 behind the shock to @xmath212 at the inside of the shell , the density rises from @xmath213 to @xmath214 and the velocity from 300 to 500 @xmath108 .",
    "the shocked w - r wind has ( from the reverse shock to the contact discontinuity ) a density of @xmath215 to @xmath216 , a temperature of @xmath217 to @xmath218 and a velocity of 1000 @xmath108 to 500 @xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath16 emission comes mostly from the rsg shell .",
    "the density in this shell is @xmath219 , which may be seen as a lower limit since this shell is not completely resolved in our calculations .",
    "the temperature in the shell is @xmath220 , indicating that there is shock heating present in addition to photoionization .",
    "the shell s velocity has slowed to @xmath221 due to its interaction with the ms wind material .",
    "judging by the geometrical extent , the evolutionary state of the w - r bubble at this time is approximately comparable to the currently observable stage of s308 .",
    "the model data show surprisingly good agreement with the x - ray observations of s308 described above .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity of a few times @xmath208 is slightly higher but of the same order of magnitude as the @xmath222 observed by @xcite .",
    "since almost all of the x - ray emission in our model comes from the w - r shell , the temperature range of @xmath223 agrees quite well with the @xmath224 that results from the spectral fit of the observed x - rays .",
    "although the observational proof for the existence of a substantially hotter gas component is still under debate , in our model it could well be identified with the shocked , hot w - r wind which contributes only a small fraction to the total soft x - ray emission .",
    "the average density in the x - ray emitting w - r shell is @xmath225 , which is well within the observationally determined range of @xmath226 for the assumed range @xmath227 of the hot gas volume filling factor @xcite .",
    "the total mass of the w - r shell is approximately 15 @xmath0 ; i.e. , most of the 18.6 @xmath0 rsg wind has already been swept up .",
    "this is at the upper end of the observationally supported range of @xmath54 for an assumed volume filling factor of 0.5 .",
    "the fact that the w - r shell supplies most of the x - ray emission alleviates the necessity to assume that thermal evaporation of rsg wind gas raises the mass of the x - ray emitting shocked w - r wind .",
    "the process of thermal evaporation , which is not implemented in our numerical model , would not be very efficient anyway , since the temperature gradient between the @xmath140 w - r shell and the shocked w - r wind at several times @xmath228 is rather modest .",
    "the conclusion of @xcite that s308 can not be described by the two - wind model seems to be vulnerable because he assumed that the x - ray emission originates from the shocked w - r wind and that the energy in the forward shock ahead of the w - r shell is completely dissipated in a different wavelength range .",
    "consequently , using the formula for the x - ray luminosity of the shocked w - r wind under the impact of conductive evaporation from @xcite in order to reproduce the observed x - ray luminosity , he derived values for the mechanical wind luminosity which are much too low compared to the actually observed values of the central w - r star .",
    "by contrast , the mechanical wind luminosity in our model calculation during the first @xmath229 of the w - r stage is in the range @xmath230 , which is in reasonable agreement with the observed stellar wind luminosity ( scaled to the distance of @xmath34 used here ) of @xmath231 @xcite or @xmath232 for a clumping - corrected mass - loss rate @xcite .    because the x - ray emitting volume is a thick shell ( @xmath210 pc ) , another observational constraint that is well reproduced in our model is the limb brightening of the x - ray emission . in figure [ ix3_ng_100_2400ev_s308_plot_apj_up.eps ]",
    "we display the unabsorbed angle - averaged x - ray intensity profile in the energy range @xmath198 kev at three evolutionary times during the early w - r stage , namely @xmath233 , and @xmath234 , the latter corresponding to the phase discussed above .",
    "we see that the `` background '' intensity produced by the hot gas in the ms bubble is of order @xmath235 .",
    "the intensity for lines of sight through the w - r shell is higher by @xmath236 orders of magnitude .",
    "the limb brightening within the w - r shell can be seen for all three profiles as well as the decrease of the peak intensity with time .",
    "the consideration of absorption would not alter this result because the limb brightening is due to the geometry of the emitting plasma rather than due to varying absorption .",
    "since the shocked w - r wind in our model calculation has not yet swept up the entire rsg wind , the x - ray emitting shell is interior to the optical shell as has been found in the observations .",
    "differing from @xcite , we interpret the gap between the outer rim of the optical emission and the outer edge of the x - ray emission as being the rsg ejecta in front of the w - r shell rather than being the w - r shell itself .",
    "the thickness of the gap in our model at this time is approximately 0.5 pc , which is smaller than the observed gap ( @xmath51 pc ) .",
    "however , this strongly depends on the exact instant of time and on the exact duration of the rsg phase as well as the velocity of the rsg wind .",
    "if our interpretation of the dynamical evolution is true , the age that has been attributed to the w - r bubble is probably significantly overestimated because of the assumption that the observed velocity @xmath57 is the velocity of the w - r shell rather than the velocity of the rsg shell .",
    "based on our model the age of the bubble is @xmath237 for the stage described above , much less than the @xmath238 derived from the observed velocity of @xmath57 .",
    "as the referee pointed out , there is no observational evidence yet of a high - velocity ( @xmath239 ) gas component that we identify as the w - r shell in our numerical results .",
    "the kinematic data obtained from the [ o ] @xmath18 emission line observations of s308 and from the n @xmath240 and c @xmath241 absorption line studies toward hd 50896 @xcite do not show velocities as high as several @xmath79 .",
    "however , if the gas in the w - r shell of our model calculation at @xmath242 has reached collisional ionization equilibrium , oxygen exists mostly as o , nitrogen as n or n , and carbon as c , c , or even completely ionized . thus , there is almost no o , n , or c in the w - r shell whose emission or , respectively , absorption could be observed .",
    "other ionic tracers are needed to find high - velocity gas of that temperature .",
    "the appearance of ngc 6888 is harder to explain within the framework of our model .",
    "the observed geometrical size implies that the nebula is younger than s308 , provided that the temporal evolution of the stellar parameters during the rsg and w - r stage is about the same .",
    "a maximum value of @xmath278000 yr can be derived under the assumptions that the optically visible nebula has not yet been swept up by the expanding w - r bubble and that our stellar model parameters are appropriate for ngc 6888 .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity @xmath29 as well as the emitting plasma temperature @xmath31 @xcite are in reasonable agreement with the model data , but the x - ray emission in the model originates from a thick shell which is more or less homogeneous rather than from small filaments with a volume filling factor of only a few % . although the hot w - r shell is able to `` hide '' mass from optical observations and thus helps to find the yet undetected portion of rsg wind mass , 8000 yr after the onset of the w - r wind it contains only @xmath273 @xmath0 , which is not enough to solve the problem completely ( assuming that the rsg mass loss used in the model is appropriate for ngc 6888 ) .",
    "the biggest difficulty is probably the appearance of the optical shell . in the numerical model",
    "the rsg shell already has a radius greater than 10 pc and the unaffected rsg wind between the w - r shell and the rsg shell contributes significantly to the @xmath16 emission .",
    "this conflicts with the observation of a very thin , filamentary shell with hydrogen number densities as high as @xmath243",
    ".    there may be various reasons for this mismatch between our model and the observations of ngc 6888 .",
    "it is possible that physical effects not yet covered in our model are more important for ngc 6888 or that the resolution applied in our calculations is not yet high enough to allow for the formation of high - density filaments .",
    "another possibility is that the actual mass - loss history of hd 192163 differs from what is expected and used in our calculations .",
    "apart from the detailed comparison , figure [ l_x_plot229_0.1 - 2.4kev_s308apj_up.eps ] illustrates another aspect : the fact that up to now only w - r bubbles have been observed in x - rays is not only by chance .",
    "at least for the ms @xmath2 rsg @xmath2 w - r sequence the x - ray luminosity during the final w - r stage exceeds that of the rest of the stellar lifetime by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , during the early w - r phase the emission comes from a relatively small volume ( compared to most of the ms lifetime ) , resulting in an even higher x - ray surface brightness , which is easier to detect .",
    "the basic difference between the simulations presented in this paper and those of @xcite is the choice of the stellar parameters , which here are chosen to model a 35 @xmath0 star that undergoes the evolution from the ms through the rsg and w - r stages .",
    "the fundamental structures which evolve are basically the same as observed in the 60 @xmath0 case .",
    "they are generally smaller because for most of the time the stellar wind luminosity and the lyman continuum luminosity are lower than in the 60 @xmath0 case . at the end of the simulation",
    "the entire bubble structure has a radius of @xmath2744 pc , which is some 6 pc smaller than the final bubble of the 60 @xmath0 case , although the 35 @xmath0 star lives 0.88 myr longer than the 60 @xmath0 star .",
    "instability - driven structure formation during the early ms phase of the star ( the formation of ionized fingers corrugating the ionization front and the formation of neutral spokes shadowed by dense clumps ) , which we found to be quite prominent in the case of the 60 @xmath0 calculation , is also visible in the calculations presented here , but it is much less pronounced and only short - lived , because of the lower mechanical wind luminosity of the star .",
    "the lower mechanical wind luminosity of the star reduces the thermal pressure of the hot gas in the bubble .",
    "the lower pressure in the hot bubble increases the geometrical thickness of the shell of swept - up h gas , making it less sensitive to thin - shell instabilities that could trigger the formation of the morphological structures described above .",
    "since this behavior better preserves the basic spherical structure , other morphological effects become visible , which might be prohibited in the 60 @xmath0 case by the strong corrugation of the bubble shell : when the swept - up h shell broadens geometrically , the plasma density in the shell decreases .",
    "this rarefaction reduces the rate of lyman continuum photons necessary to sustain the photoionization of the shell and excess photons become available , which drive the ionization front outward and photoevaporate additional material from the neutral shell of swept - up ambient medium .",
    "the inward flow of evaporated material collides with the outward flow of the dissolving swept - up h shell , temporarily forming a new shell of enhanced density .",
    "since all the plasma within the h region is almost isothermal , this density fluctuation vanishes soon .",
    "another consequence of the reduced stellar wind luminosity ( compared to the 60 @xmath0 case ) is the fact that for most of the time the shape of the h region is more or less preserved as a broad shell interior to the thin shell of swept - up ambient material rather than being so thin as in the 60 @xmath0 case where the h region is compressed into the illuminated inner part of the outer shell . nevertheless , the geometrical thickness of the photoionized shell shrinks at the end of the simulation when the stellar wind luminosity reaches its maximum during the final w - r stage .",
    "the morphological impact of the low - velocity mass - loss phase ( the rsg stage ) is more prominent than that of the 60 @xmath0 star ( the lbv stage ) , because the total mass loss during the rsg stage is higher ( @xmath2718.6  @xmath0 ) than during the lbv stage of the 60 @xmath0 star ( @xmath277.3  @xmath0 ) .",
    "the slowly expanding rsg wind material is subsequently swept up and accelerated by the shocked w - r wind so that rayleigh - taylor instabilities break it into filaments .    the final , pre - supernova structure that shows up in the 35 @xmath0 case after 4.945 myr is basically comparable to that of the 60 @xmath0 case at its end . the entire bubble is slightly smaller , the h shell at the inside of the outer neutral swept - up shell is more extended than in the 60 @xmath0 case .",
    "outer shell and h region are less clumpy and show less rippling as a consequence of the different evolutionary scenarios .    the reduced substructure formation during the early ms phase is also reflected in the circumstellar energetics .",
    "the decrease of ionization energy and thermal energy of warm gas ( compared to the respective case without stellar wind ) resulting from the formation of dense photoionized structures with short recombination times is smaller than for the 60 @xmath0 case .",
    "ionization energy dominates the energy in the circumstellar gas for most of the evolution .",
    "the kinetic energy of bulk motion as well as the warm and the hot component of thermal energy stay fairly close together from @xmath244 until the star enters the rsg phase .",
    "the energetic variations during the rsg stage are stronger than those during the lbv stage of the 60 @xmath0 star because , due to the duration of the rsg phase , the ionizing radiation of the star is switched off for a considerable period of time so that the photoionized regions recombine .",
    "in addition , the mass that is ejected during the rsg stage and accelerated during the subsequent w - r stage is about 2.5 times higher than the mass ejected during the lbv stage of the 60 @xmath0 star .    at the end of the 35 @xmath0 simulation",
    "the total energy transfer efficiency is 1% .",
    "this value is about the same as in the corresponding case without stellar wind , but it is 2.7 times higher than the value at the end of the 60 @xmath0 simulation .",
    "54% of the net energy which has been added to the system is then in the form of ionization energy , 36% in thermal energy and 10% in kinetic energy of bulk motion .",
    "the corresponding values at the end of the 60 @xmath0 calculation are 25% , 40% , and 35% , respectively .",
    "this is another indication that the stellar wind plays a more prominent role in the 60 @xmath0 case .",
    "remarkable agreement of the x - ray properties is found when comparing our model calculations during the early w - r phase with observations of s308 .",
    "the order of magnitude of the observed x - ray luminosity as well as the temperature of the emitting plasma and the limb brightening of the intensity profile are well reproduced .",
    "the obvious explanation that our model overcomes the `` missing wind problem '' described in  [ sec_observations ] is that almost the entire x - ray emission during this phase comes from the w - r shell rather than from the shocked w - r wind .",
    "analytical models constructed so far ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assume the w - r shell to be thin and cool so that the energy in the forward shock is completely dissipated in the low - energy wavelength range .",
    "the source of x - rays in these models is the shocked w - r wind and the efficiency of heat conduction and thermal evaporation between the hot gas and the cold w - r shell strongly influences the luminosity and the spectral shape of the x - ray emission .",
    "if heat conduction is efficient enough to cool the hot shocked w - r wind down to the observed temperature and if the w - r wind luminosity in the models is adjusted to reproduce the observed x - ray luminosity , the w - r wind luminosity is usually much lower than observed @xcite .    another factor that reduces",
    "the x - ray luminosity in our model to values roughly comparable with s308 is the assumed set of chemical abundances . although he and n are overabundant according to the observations in the nebula , the underabundance of the other metals reduces the x - ray luminosity by a factor of @xmath148 compared to what can be expected from solar chemical composition .",
    "a further consequence of this interpretation of our results is that the @xmath16 emission originates mostly from the rsg shell .",
    "this is in agreement with the finding of @xcite that the x - ray emission is completely interior to the optical shell .",
    "since the age of s308 ( and other w - r bubbles ) was hitherto derived from the expansion velocity of the optical nebula under the assumption that the nebula is part of the w - r shell , our results imply an age of s308 which is much younger ( @xmath237 ) than assumed so far .",
    "however , the match of our model data and the observations is worse for the case of ngc 6888 . besides numerical or model restrictions",
    ", differences of the mass - loss and luminosity history between the central star of ngc 6888 and our model star might be responsible for the discrepancies .",
