    "predictions of inflation seem to be in excellent agreement with the cmb data  @xcite . however , it is still unclear what is the nature of the field which drives inflation .",
    "historically , a canonical scalar field has been the preferred candidate for inflaton , but in recent years , also a non - canonical scalar field , dubbed as @xmath0-inflaton , was considered as serious alternative mechanisms to drive inflation  @xcite .",
    "both scenarios lead to nearly scale invariant power - spectra with negligible running and hence can not be distinguished ( or ruled out ) from the current cmb data  @xcite . the future missions , including planck  @xcite , hold promise in ruling our either of these two scenarios by looking at the non - gaussianity of the primordial spectra , but quantifying non - gaussianity requires one to go beyond linear order  @xcite .",
    "there are four different approaches in the literature to study cosmological perturbations : 1 )  solving einstein s equations order - by - order  @xcite ; 2 )  the covariant approach based on a general frame vector @xmath1  @xcite ; 3 )  the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) approach based on the normal frame vector @xmath2  @xcite ; 4 )  the reduced action approach  @xcite . in the case of linear perturbations",
    ", it was shown that all of these four approaches lead to identical equations of motion . however , to our knowledge , a complete analysis has not been done in the literature for higher - order perturbations .    in this",
    "talk , to illustrate the problems that may occur at higher - order , and not to get bogged - down with the gauge issues , we consider a simple situation : we freeze all metric perturbations and focus on the perturbations of a minimally - coupled , generalised scalar field @xmath3 , whose lagrangian density is given by  @xcite [ eq : genscal ] = p(x , )  , 2x = ^ _  .",
    "more precisely , we will only consider linear perturbations of the scalar field , [ eq : def - perphi ] ( t , * x*)=__0(t ) + ^(1)(t , * x * )  , about the 4-dimensional frw  background , while expanding all the dependent quantities , like @xmath4 and stress tensor , up to second order , and highlight the main differences in these approaches .",
    "for this purpose , it is convenient to compare the ratio [ eq : cs - def ] c_s^2 =  , in the components of the stress  tensor and related quantities .",
    "since @xmath5 is dimensionally the square of a speed , we will refer to this ratio as the `` speed of propagation '' .",
    "below , we will provide the key results and , for details , we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite .",
    "+ perturbed tensor and adm approach : for an arbitrary scalar field lagrangian , @xmath6 may represent an unstable perturbation ; only under very special conditions , most notably for the canonical scalar field , the _ effective speed of propagation _ of @xmath6 ( and @xmath7 ) are the same as that of the standard definition  @xcite c^2 _ = using  , we can define speeds related with the propagation of density perturbations in the background frame from @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ,    [ eq : cst ] c_0 ^ 2=    , c_^2 = c^2 _ .    note that these velocities become imaginary indicating that the perturbations may be unstable .",
    "the nature of this instability is easily understood in analogy with classical mechanics : when @xmath8 is negative , the system resembles an inverted harmonic oscillator and , no matter how small @xmath9 , it will rapidly run away from the background solution @xmath10 and from the perturbative regime . + covariant approach : in the fluid frame , the energy density exhibits the same kind of instability as the perturbed stress - tensor @xmath6 , also for the canonical scalar field .",
    "in particular , the perturbations turn out to be unstable because of the negative sign of the spatial momentum contribution . only under special conditions , the _ effective speed of propagation _ of the energy density and pressure perturbations are equal . using  ,",
    "the speed of propagation for density and pressure perturbations in the fluid frame are c_^2 = - , c_p^2=c_^2=c_^2  , which differ from eq .  . + symmetry reduced approach : the basic idea here is to perturb the action about the frw  background , up to second ( or higher ) order , and reduce it so that the perturbations are described in terms of a single gauge - invariant variable . the second order canonical hamiltonian is identical to the stress - tensor for the canonical scalar field , but differs for general non - canonical fields",
    "this implies that @xmath6 and the canonical hamiltonian @xmath11 may become unstable under different conditions .",
    "the first question is why the canonical hamiltonian , perturbed stress  tensor and super - hamiltonian coincide for a canonical scalar field , but not for general scalar field lagrangians . to go about answering this question ,",
    "it is necessary to look at the four approaches we have employed from a different perspective . in the first two approaches  perturbed stress  tensor and covariant approach  we perturb the general expression for the scalar field stress  tensor and obtain its second order contribution @xmath6 . in the last two approaches  adm  formulation and symmetry - reduced action  we expand the action to second order in the perturbation and obtain the super-(canonical ) hamiltonian of the corresponding perturbed action . while the super - hamiltonian @xmath12 is identical to @xmath6 , the canonical hamiltonian @xmath11 differs .    under what condition the super - hamiltonian @xmath12 ,",
    "the canonical hamiltonian @xmath11 for non - canonical scalar fields are identical ?",
    "they are all identical provided the time - variation of background quantities ( like @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) can be neglected .",
    "( for the canonical scalar field , these functions are indeed constant and the perturbed quantities therefore coincide . )",
    "although such an approximation may be valid for specific non - canonical fields , they fail for some of the known fields like tachyon , dbi  @xcite .",
