    "one unanticipated discovery of the hk - survey @xcite search for extremely metal - poor stars was the realization that a large fraction of metal - poor objects exhibited large carbon over - abundances , with [ c / fe ] reaching up to 2.0 dex or beyond ( rossi , beers , & sneden 1999 ; rossi et al .",
    "the carbon excesses are most obvious for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 . ]",
    "it is not yet clear whether the mechanism responsible for the enrichment ceased , and only plays a small role at higher metallicity , or whether it continued to operate at a constant absolute level which progressively became insignificant in comparison to the increasing metallicity of the interstellar medium as the young galactic halo was chemically enriched .",
    "the decrease with metallicity of the upper envelope of [ c / fe ] for stars in the rossi et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2005 ) studies is consistent with the latter possibility ( ryan 2003 ) , but as the source of the carbon is not yet known , we can not be certain at present .",
    "estimates of the frequency of carbon - enhanced , metal - poor ( cemp ) stars in ongoing surveys for metal - poor stars ranges between 10% and 25% , depending on how the sample is defined @xcite .",
    "around 70% ( aoki et al . 2003 ) to 80% ( tsangarides 2005 ) of the cemp stars appear also to be rich in @xmath0-process elements .",
    "carbon - rich stars belonging to the halo population , the so - called ch stars ( keenan 1942 ) , have been studied by a number of previous authors .",
    "these stars have relatively low metallicity and large excesses of neutron - capture elements associated with the @xmath0-process ( vanture 1992 ) .",
    "the excesses of both carbon and the @xmath0-process elements suggest a large contribution from agb nucleosynthesis , although these ch stars appear not to be in the agb phase at present .",
    "a clear explanation of their chemical nature was given by mcclure and his colleagues @xcite who found that most , if not all , ch stars are members of binary systems .",
    "this strongly suggested that mass transfer to a surviving companion from an agb star ( which is now evolved to a white dwarf ) is their likely origin .",
    "a similar interpretation can be applied to the more metal - rich ba stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , as well as to subgiant ch stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that this mechanism of carbon enrichment likely operates in both metal - rich and metal - poor binary systems .",
    "one important question is whether this same scenario , based on agb nucleosynthesis and mass - transfer in binary systems , can fully explain the cemp stars found in recent surveys for metal - poor stars . in an effort to uncover the origin(s ) of the carbon excesses , we embarked on a program of high - resolution spectroscopy using the anglo - australian telescope and the subaru telescope .",
    "our intention was to measure element abundance ratios that could be related to various nucleosynthetic environments , and to obtain multi - epoch radial velocity measurements that might identify the possible role of binarity in the formation of these objects .",
    "it soon became clear , based on our work , and that of other groups , that a range of nucleosynthetic signatures existed amongst the cemp stars .",
    "for example , sneden et al . ( 1996 ) identified a strong @xmath7-process signature in cs  22892052 , while norris et al .",
    "( 1997a ) and barbuy et al . (",
    "1997 ) found strong @xmath0-process signatures in four other cemp stars ( two of which were originally discovered outside the hk survey of beers et al . ) , while norris et al .",
    "( 1997b ) and bonifacio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found normal neutron - capture abundances in the cemp star cs  22957027 . despite the excitement that surrounded the discovery of the @xmath7-process - rich star cs  22892052",
    ", no other cemp stars with excesses of r - process elements have been found .",
    "all remaining cemp stars from the hk survey observed to date at high spectroscopic resolution either exhibit @xmath0-process signatures ( cemp - s ) or normal neutron - capture abundances ( cemp - no ) .",
    "a recent summary of the diverse classes of cemp stars can be found in aoki et al .",
    "( 2002a , their figure 8) , where [ ba / fe ] acts as a neutron - capture diagnostic , while [ ( c+n)/fe ] is a measure of the number of c and n nuclei , since the abundances of these species may have been re - distributed by the cn cycle .",
    "aoki et al . proposed that discrete classes of ba - rich and ba - normal stars can be distinguished . in this paper",
    "we examine this proposed separation of the cemp stars into @xmath0-rich and @xmath0-normal classes in more detail , and discuss scenarios for the formation and evolution of these objects based on element and isotopic abundances measured in recently published studies , as well as on the luminosity distributions of the two classes .",
    "cemp stars for which measurements of @xmath2c/@xmath1c , n , which we assume to be pure @xmath3n , and ba have been reported , are listed in table  1 .",
    "figure  1 shows their [ ba / fe ] and [ fe / h ] values superposed on the distribution of [ ba / fe ] for non - cemp stars , using data compiled by norris , ryan & beers ( 2001 ) . for the purposes of this work ,",
    "we define c - rich to mean [ c / fe ] @xmath8 0.5 , and ba - rich to mean [ ba / fe ] @xmath8 0.5 . since the cemp stars were observed without prior knowledge of their neutron - capture - element abundances , the apparently clear division separation into @xmath0-process - rich and @xmath0-process - normal stars seen in figure  1 is not due to any explicit selection criteria .",
    "it should be noted that , even though studies of cemp stars are rapidly increasing , objects for which all of the abundances of c isotopes , n , and ba are determined are still quite limited .",
    "hence , further detailed abundance studies of such objects are strongly desired .",
    "we suspect that further separation of the ba - rich stars into @xmath0-process and @xmath7-process stars , or some combination of the processes , may also be relevant .",
    "most ba - rich objects in table 1 have [ ba / eu ] larger than 0 , indicating that ba principally originates from the @xmath0-process .",
    "there are a few cemp stars that have much lower [ ba / eu ] values than that of the @xmath0-process component in solar system material : e.g. , cs  29497034 ( [ ba / eu]@xmath9 :",
    "hill et al .",
    "2000 ) ; he  21481247 ( [ ba / eu]@xmath10 : cohen et al .",
    "these examples suggest a significant contribution from the @xmath7-process to eu .",
    "( an alternative possibility is a contribution of the @xmath0-process with quite different condition , e.g. , with very high neutron density ; johnson & bolte 2004 ) .",
    "however , the [ ba / eu ] of these objects is still much higher than that of the @xmath7-process element - enhanced stars ( [ ba / eu]@xmath11 ; e.g. , sneden et al . 1996 , 2003 ) . hence , a large contribution of the @xmath0-process to ba should be assumed .",
    "we presume for now that most or all of the ba - rich stars in our sample carry an @xmath0-process signature , and we use the expressions ba - rich and @xmath0-rich interchangeably .",
    "we note that the carbon- and @xmath7-process - element - enhanced star cs  22892052 is not included in our sample , as it seems likely ( given that this is the only star in which both carbon and pure @xmath12process enhancement have been detected to date ) that the carbon enhancement and @xmath12process enhancement may not be causally connected .",
    "figure  2a shows [ c / n ] as a function of @xmath1c/@xmath2c for our sample of cemp stars .",
    "filled circles signify ba - rich stars , while open squares are ba - normal stars . in this figure ,",
    "the equilibrium values of the cn - cycle ( see table  1 ) are shown by the _ cross _ at the lower left .",
    "inspection of this figure suggests that a correlation exists between these two abundance ratios , as ( a ) the @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratio decreases from @xmath1340 to @xmath1310 without large changes in [ c / n ] , and ( b ) the @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratio decreases from @xmath1310 to @xmath133 with declining [ c / n ] . while sequence ( b ) indicates the cn - cycle approaching equilibrium , sequence ( a ) suggests a partial cn - cycle in which @xmath2c burning is limited by the short timescale of the process , or by a limited supply of protons ( see , e.g. , aoki et al .",
    "2002a ) .",
    "whereas figure  2(a ) presents the commonly derived ratio [ c / n ] , a more physically significant ratio is @xmath2c/@xmath3n , since both of these isotopes are produced only in the cn - cycle .",
    "thus , any change in this ratio must reflect cn - cycle activity , whereas [ c / n ] can be influenced by pure @xmath1c production in the triple - alpha process .",
    "we assume here that all of the n is @xmath3n .",
    "the importance of considering isotopes rather than just elements is illustrated by the sun , whose @xmath2c/@xmath3n = 0.04 is within a factor of 4 of the equilibrium value ( 0.01 ) , but whose @xmath1c/@xmath2c = 90 is a factor of 30 from equilibrium ( 3 ) .",
    "it is likely that the pre - solar nebula contained @xmath1c , @xmath2c and @xmath3n produced in a source ( or sources ) that approached cn - cycle equilibrium , and substantially more pure @xmath1c from a triple - alpha source that elevated the @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratio well above the cn - cycle value .",
    "figure  2(b ) shows log@xmath14(@xmath2c/@xmath3n ) vs log@xmath14(@xmath1c/@xmath2c ) .",
    "the sequences ( a ) and ( b ) discussed in connection with [ c / n ] are , as expected , also seen in figure  2(b ) .",
    "the sun no longer sits on the sequence .",
    "the pattern is broadly consistent with the cn - cycle s approach to equilibrium , illustrated for one particular model at 20@xmath15  k by clayton ( 1968 , his figure  5 - 15 ) , where the @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratio approaches equilibrium long before @xmath2c/@xmath3n .",
    "we point out here that the advanced stages of sequence ( b ) seem to be occupied only by the ba - normal stars .",
    "this provides an important first clue to the different origins of the cemp - s stars on the one hand , and the cemp - no stars on the other .",
    "as may be seen in figure  2 , the cemp - s stars all have @xmath2c/@xmath3n ratios close to 1 ( @xmath16 @xmath17 log@xmath14(@xmath2c/@xmath3n ) @xmath4 0.8 ) , whereas the cemp - no stars extend over the full range of values extending down to the cn equilibrium value . a second distinction between the two groups",
    "is found in the h - r diagram .",
    "using spectroscopically - determined surface gravities , we calculate radii for the stars , assuming identical masses of 0.85  m@xmath18 , and combine these with adopted effective temperatures to calculate luminosities ; uncertainties in these values should render @xmath19 accurate to about 0.3 in the logarithm . ] .",
    "the resulting h - r diagram is shown in figure  3 .",
    "it is notable that the cemp - no stars are found only at the highest luminosities , log@xmath14(@xmath19/l@xmath18 ) @xmath20 2.0 , whereas the cemp - s stars are found throughout the post - main - sequence subgiant and giant branches .",
    "it is also worth noting that , despite their strong @xmath0-process signatures , the cemp - s stars clearly are not currently agb stars , whose luminosities would exceed @xmath21/l@xmath18 ) @xmath22 .",
    "combining these two pieces of information suggests a distinction between the origins of these two subclasses of cemp stars , which we consider below .",
    "two of the cemp - no stars ( cs  22949037 and cs  29498043 ) also exhibit over - abundances of oxygen and the @xmath23 elements .",
    "these are first - ascent giants that presumably began their lives with very large @xmath1c abundances .",
    "the low iron - peak - element content suggests that enrichment of the gas benefited from mass loss from a massive stellar envelope , or from a supernova which ejected little of the material from its deepest layers ( e.g. , tsujimoto & shigeyama 2003 ; umeda & nomoto 2003 ) .",
    "this hypothesis requires low - mass star formation from material that was not yet well - mixed in the very early galaxy .",
    "here we examine the interpretation that the cemp - no stars , including the above two objects , formed from c - enriched gas .",
    "( 1)binarity : if the cemp - no stars are congenitally c - rich , then the binary fraction of such stars should be the same as that of non - cemp stars .",
    "table  1 shows that little is currently known about the binary status of this group of stars , but the data that exist presently do not contradict this requirement .",
    "( 2)evolutionary stages : the cemp - no stars are found only at the top of the giant branch ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this could be a sampling effect , and cemp - no stars near the main - sequence may remain to be discovered .",
    "the fraction of stars near the main - sequence turn - off in the full hk sample is about 50% ( beers et al .",
    "1992 ; beers 1999 )",
    ". however , cemp giants have lower temperatures than main - sequence stars , and thus would be more easily identified by the strength of their molecular carbon bands ( such as the ch g - band ) than for main - sequence stars , if a similar level of carbon excess is assumed .",
    "the distribution of cemp - no stars in @xmath24 and in luminosity shows a clear contrast to that of cemp - s stars , which likely arose due to mass accretion from an agb companion ( see next subsection ) .",
    "( 3)c and n abundances : cn - cycling was probably unimportant during their main - sequence evolution , as these are low - mass stars .",
    "their surface chemical abundances would therefore not be modified at that phase . however , during their post - main - sequence phase , the products of the cn - cycle appear at the surface as a result of first dredge - up , in much the same way as they do for conventional ( non - cemp ) low - mass stars . in fact , the evolution of the @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratio as a function of luminosity ( see figure  4 ) appears consistent with that of normal pop .",
    "ii first - ascent giants in the globular cluster m4 and in the field , and might be explained in terms of deeper mixing than standard models predict ( see charbonnel 1995 , her figure 1 ) with @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratios of 3 - 10 for @xmath25(@xmath19/l@xmath18 ) in the range 2 - 3 .",
    "if cs  22949037 is to be viewed in the context of this model , how should we view its high n abundance ?",
    "norris et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) suggested this may originate in n - producing hypernovae , whereas depagne et al .",
    "( 2002 ) associated it with cn - processing subsequent to a low - energy supernova .",
    "the @xmath2c/@xmath3n ratio in cs  22949037 ( see figure  2(b ) ) is certainly consistent with cn - cycling having been active , as suggested by depagne et al . , but whether this occurred after a low - energy supernova that might account for the low iron yield ( relative to magnesium and carbon ) or after a hypernova that produced a high nitrogen yield directly , is not yet settled .    a possible argument _ against _ cs  22949037 being a member of the proposed class of cemp - no stars is its position in the [ c / n ] vs @xmath24 diagram ( figure 12 of aoki et al .",
    "here the star is seen at lower [ c / n ] than other stars at its temperature , as if it does not belong to the same evolutionary sequence .",
    "this may indicate that the high nitrogen abundance of cs  22949037 is not due to internal processes within the star , but rather may originate from a massive progenitor , as pointed out by aoki et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is that internal mixing was more effective in cs  22949037 than in other stars with similar effective temperatures .",
    "the efficiency of internal processes may not only be a function of the effective temperature , but could also be related to stellar rotation , metallicity etc . , and might not easily be predicted for individual objects .    the above facts",
    "at least do not contradict our hypothesis that cemp - no stars formed from c - rich gas , although explicit support of this scenario is still weak , except for the two o and @xmath23 element - enhanced stars .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the abundance peculiarities of such stars occurs at the top of the red giant branch in a mechanism quite different to the congenital one proposed here .",
    "fujimoto et al . ( 2000 ) have calculated that in low - mass , very metal - poor giants , convection will carry c that has been freshly synthesised in the he flash up to the h - rich layers and eventually into the surface convective zone , where @xmath1c- , @xmath2c- and @xmath3n - rich metal - poor post - red - giant branch stars will be produced .",
    "it is not clear whether the luminosities of our stars are appropriate to that phase of evolution , but chemically at least the cemp - no stars are similar to those envisaged by fujimoto et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "cemp - s stars are found to encompass a wide range of evolutionary states , from the main - sequence turnoff to the tip of the red - giant branch .",
    "they exhibit high @xmath0-process abundances and , although @xmath2c/@xmath1c approaches the equilibrium ratio , @xmath2c/@xmath3n does not , although it too is lower in the higher luminosity stars of this type .",
    "these factors , combined with the high @xmath0-process abundances , suggest that most , if not all , of their chemical anomalies are extrinsic to these stars .    it has been proposed that most members of this group of stars formed from `` normal '' ism material , but then later accreted c- and @xmath0-rich gas as ch stars , ba stars and subgiant ch stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this gas apparently had undergone some hydrogen burning to produce @xmath2c , but either on short timescales , or in proton - poor environments that prevented complete evolution of the @xmath2c/@xmath3n ratio toward equilibrium .",
    "comparison of these stars @xmath2c/@xmath3n abundances with the time - tags in clayton s calculation ( see our figure 2(b ) ) would suggest a timescale less than 3@xmath26  yr . one such environment where this might occur is the he - intershell of a thermally - pulsing agb star , which is proton - poor and undergoes nucleosynthesis on much shorter timescales than is required for the @xmath2c/@xmath3n ratio to achieve equilibrium .",
    "this environment is also thought to be the most important site for production of the @xmath0-process elements .",
    "if the element anomalies were purely inherited from a companion , then the isotope ratios would be independent of the evolutionary state of the accretor .",
    "figure  4 shows that even the low - luminosity ba - rich stars have low @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratios , quite unlike normal halo giants .",
    "there is in fact little , if any , change of this ratio with position in the h - r diagram .",
    "we noted above that the luminosity distributions of the cemp - s and cemp - no stars differ considerably .",
    "the fact that the cemp - s stars are not primarily high - luminosity objects may be additional evidence that their abundance properties were accreted .",
    "stars that formed from gas with peculiar abundances will possess that material _ throughout their structure _ , whereas accretors will have abnormal abundances in their _ surface zones _ exclusively .",
    "as the latter objects ascend the giant branch , the surface material will be diluted by normal material as the convective zone deepens .",
    "hence , one might expect accretors to drop out of the sample of c - rich stars as they ascend the giant branch .",
    "this may explain the greater fraction of low - luminosity cemp - s objects compared with the existence of only high - luminosity cemp - no stars in the complete sample of c - rich objects provided ( essentially ) from the hk survey .",
    "if accreted systems do indeed dilute their envelopes as they evolve , the survival of at least some of these objects to high luminosities must reflect the large fractions of the envelope mass accreted .",
    "this discussion seems to be the opposite of the suggestion by @xcite that the excesses of carbon and @xmath0-process elements found in subgiant ch stars are not diluted by the deepening of the convective envelope when the star becomes a red giant ( a ba star ) , and that subgiant ch stars have thick mantles of material accreted from companion agb stars .",
    "however , the average metallicity of cemp stars discussed here is more than _ two dex lower _ than that of subgiant ch stars and ba stars .",
    "the effect of mass transfer from a companion agb star should appear more clearly in metal - poor stars , and objects in which only a small amount of material was accreted might therefore be included amongst our unevolved cemp stars .",
    "a possible weakness with this proposal for the cemp - s stars is that several of them are known to exhibit no detected radial - velocity variation over long periods ( norris et al .",
    "1997a ; preston & sneden 2001 ) , as shown in table 1 .",
    "such stars provide no evidence of a companion that could previously have deposited the @xmath0-process material onto its surface . however , a monte carlo analysis of the observed radial velocity data for a sample of 19 cemp - s stars led lucatello et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to conclude that an observed binary fraction of 68% was consistent with _ all _ cemp - s stars being in multiple systems .",
    "the detection efficiency of such systems was found to be significantly below 100% , because of the finite timespan of extant radial velocity data , the possibly wide range of periods in the parent distribution , inclination effects , and the finite accuracy of the measurements , amongst other factors .",
    "alternatively , preston & sneden ( 2001 ) suggested a path to the carbon - enhanced subgiant stars with no binary interaction to explain these apparently single cemp - s stars .",
    "more troublesome for the mass - transfer scenario are the stars lp  7067 and cs  22898027 , which exhibit high li / h ratios , consistent with the primordial value ( thorburn 1994 ; aoki et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the latter constraint requires either that the matter transferred from an unidentified companion also had the primordial li / h ratio , which is most unlikely for an agb star whose envelope has been mixed with deep layers where he - burning at 10@xmath27 k and the @xmath0-process has occurred , or the star was enriched by almost pure c and @xmath0-process material containing little h to dilute the primordial li / h value .",
    "complete mergers of a binary pair to form the single star seen today would not preserve the primordial li / h ratio either , so a non - binary origin must be found .",
    "nor can we appeal to non - standard , internal mixing scenarios to regenerate a star that has already gone through he - burning to produce excess c , because such objects , if they exist at all , would not preserve the primordial li / h value .",
    "the unavoidable conclusion seems to be that lp  7067 , cs  22898027 , and possibly other apparently single , li - preserving cemp - s stars did not form by the accretion mechanism , and need not be binaries .",
    "of the four apparently single cemp - s stars , two are known to be li - bearing .",
    "it may be that there are two distinct classes of cemp - s stars : li - bearing single stars , and li - poor , mass - transfer binaries .",
    "we have shown that most cemp stars divide cleanly into ba - rich and ba - normal objects , which we refer to as cemp - s and cemp - no stars , respectively .",
    "the isotopic compositions of the two classes and their different luminosity distributions have led us to propose that the two classes have different origins .",
    "we associate the cemp - no sample with stars that formed with abnormally high @xmath1c abundances , which they inherited from the gas clouds from which they formed .",
    "possible mechanisms by which the gas clouds were enriched include supernovae whose mass cut was exterior to most heavier metals , or mass - losing massive stars .",
    "these congenitally c - rich objects have processed the @xmath1c through the cno - cycle during their shell - hydrogen - burning first - ascent red - giant - branch phase , and have dredged @xmath2c and @xmath3n to the surface in much the same way as normal low - mass stars .",
    "we speculate that such stars are found preferentially near the upper end of the red - giant branch with low temperatures , because the enhancement of carbon is identified by the strength of absorption bands of carbon - bearing molecules .",
    "in contrast , the cemp - s sample is found over a wide range of evolutionary stages , and while it possesses a similar @xmath1c/@xmath2c distribution to the @xmath0-normal stars , @xmath3n is not as heavily processed , which we believe may indicate shorter nucleosynthetic timescales and/or proton starvation of the cn - cycle .",
    "we propose that binary stars in this group accreted material enriched in @xmath1c , @xmath2c , a little n , and @xmath0-process elements from a now - extinct agb companion .",
    "as these stars climb the first - ascent giant branch , their accreted layers will be diluted with original envelope material , and in some cases the stars will drop out of the cemp - s class . this could explain why high - luminosity ( low - temperature ) members do not completely dominate this class .",
    "non - binary members of the cemp - s group , on the other hand , may have formed from gas enriched by such objects , i.e. , be congenitally abnormal , especially if they retain significant li abundances , as two out of the four possibly - single cemp - s do .",
    "we believe that the full diversity of cemp stars has yet to be discovered observationally , let alone explained theoretically . hence , continued characterisation and analysis of these objects is surely warranted . some stars , such as lp  7067 , still present challenges to the agb - accretion picture ; we expect additional examples of non - conforming stars to be identified . nevertheless , we are of the view that the distinctions set out in this work , while still incomplete , may shed light on the diverse origins of the cemp stars .",

    "<S> despite the fact that objects in both groups were selected from the same surveys ( primarily the hk survey ) , without _ a - priori _ knowledge of their @xmath0-process element abundances , we identify the following remarkable difference between the two classes : @xmath0-element - rich cemp ( cemp - s ) stars occupy a wide range of evolutionary states , but do not have a strongly evolved @xmath2c/@xmath3n ratio , whereas @xmath0-element - normal cemp stars ( cemp - no ) are found only high up the first - ascent giant branch , and possess @xmath2c/@xmath3n ratios approaching the cn - cycle equilibrium value .    </S>",

    "<S> dilution of transferred surface material as the accretor ascends the giant branch , and its surface convective zone deepens , may reduce the number of such stars whose surfaces remain c - rich at high luminosities . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , a cemp - no star is proposed to have formed from gas that was enriched in @xmath1c from the triple - alpha process in a previous generation of stars , some of which has been converted to @xmath2c and @xmath3n during the present star s giant - branch evolution . </S>",
