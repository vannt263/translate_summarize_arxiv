    "dynamic self - organisation and , in particular , mechanisms of swarming behaviour of microorganisms , cells , and animals remain one of the most intriguing problems at the interface of physics and biology .",
    "numerous physical models of interacting self - propelled particles have been proposed recently to study these phenomena ( see review papers @xcite ) .",
    "all these models capture the essential prerequisites for swarming : out - of - equilibrium state , which is manifested in the self - propulsion of particles or other mechanisms of transforming external energy into directed motion , and aligning or attractive interactions between the particles .",
    "the motion of individuals has been described in the simplest case by particles moving with a constant speed and subjected to angular noise ( the vicsek model @xcite ) .",
    "more advanced presentations of active agents include friction , thrust force , and noise , like , for example , the active brownian particle model ( abp ) @xcite , or even a very detailed mechanics of cell or animal locomotion @xcite .",
    "the interactions required for the transition from individual to collective dynamics have been introduced in a variety of ways . in the vicsek model , the swarming results from the action of a collision - type interaction that aligns the velocity of each actively moving particle in a big ensemble to the average local velocity @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the particles individual direction of motion can be coupled to the mean orientation or position of the swarm @xcite . in some implementations",
    ", the type of many - body interaction depends on the distance between neighbouring particles @xcite .",
    "the active motion and collective behaviour has also been observed in a number of synthetic systems including chemotactic colloidal particles @xcite , brownian machines and ratchets ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "swimming particles with hydrodynamic interactions studied theoretically using simulations or direct solution of the stokes equation also showed an onset of collective dynamics @xcite . because of the microscopic size , their motion is a subject to both passive and active fluctuations , which suggests that the abp model , based on the langevin equation for the velocity , could be more appropriate in these cases than the models assuming constant propulsion speed .",
    "the abp model has received much attention in literature and has been successfully applied to a variety of problems @xcite .",
    "depending on the type of system under study , different types of coupling between the abps have been used .",
    "several realisations of the model assumed only conservative @xcite or chemical interactions @xcite between moving agents .",
    "another development was based on the theory of canonical - dissipative system @xcite .",
    "_ studied the brownian dynamics of a microswimmer and demonstrated its consistency with the abp model @xcite .",
    "erdmann and ebeling studied the active brownian particle model with oseen - type hydrodynamic interactions @xcite and observed several swarming modes .",
    "recently , grossmann et al .",
    "@xcite studied the onset of the collective motion in a system of abps with velocity alignment and both passive and active fluctuations and found not only orientational order - disorder transition but also bistable dynamics states .",
    "the language of hydrodynamics is conceptually well suited for description of the swarm motion .",
    "this relation has been explored already in the early papers by toner and tu @xcite , who introduced a navier - stokes - like continuum model for active materials .",
    "the hydrodynamic behaviour of active swarms can be inferred directly from microscopic description @xcite .",
    "_ derived hydrodynamic equations governing the density and velocity fields from the microscopic dynamics for a gas of self - propelled particles with pairwise interactions @xcite .",
    "one can notice that similar ideas are exploited in the mesoscale methods in fluid modelling such as multi - particle collision dynamics ( mpcd ) @xcite , where a collision operator is used to align particles to the average local flow direction , or the dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) @xcite , where the hydrodynamics comes in through inelastic collisions between the particles . both of these methods designed to respect the momentum transport ( long - wave hydrodynamic modes ) and to suppress the fluctuations ( the high frequency modes ) to achieve the hydrodynamic behaviour at longer time and lengthscales .",
    "obviously , the swarming behaviour can be achieved through mpcd or dpd - like interactions as well .",
    "the possibility to develop the collective dynamics through dissipative interactions has been recently investigated by grossman et al .",
    "@xcite . in their model ,",
    "the system of active particles with spring - dashpot interactions demonstrated a discontinuous transition into the aligned state upon reduction of noise and various types of collective migration or vortex - like motion depending on the confinement .",
    "we are convinced that a system with dissipative interactions can have at least qualitatively similar dynamics to the models with aligning interactions like the vicsek model . in the spirit of these observations",
    ", it is tempting to test whether the quantitative features of the swarming behaviour can be reproduced in a generic dissipative model upon increasing energy influx .    in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamics of such a model and demonstrate that collective motion regimes can be achieved in the same way as in the standard models of swarming , like the vicsek model .",
    "we combine two well - developed approaches : the active brownian particle model , which allows us to introduce the self - propulsion and interactions with the environment in a transparent way , and dissipative interactions for the active particles , so that the collective dynamics would arise from explicit pairwise forces . by analyzing the statistical properties of this hybrid model ,",
    "we show that it has the same universal properties across the order - disorder transition as those reported for the vicsek model . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe the construction of the model , in section [ results ] we show its statistical properties in a wide range of parameters , and calculate the phase boundary for the orientational order - disorder transition .",
    "we discuss the results in section [ discussion ] , and then conclude the paper in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "to study the dynamic self - organisation of active particles we introduce a two level model . at the single particle level",
    "we include the factors determining the particle motion in a viscous medium : temperature and thermal noise / fluctuations , friction , and a motor . at the two - body level",
    ", we introduce dissipative interparticle interactions .",
    "there we also include some noise , whose nature is , however , different from that of the environment .",
    "the noise at the many - body level refers to biomimetic behavioural features like imperfect alignment of particles to their neighbours .",
    "although the noise in the interaction is of non - thermal origin , it can also be characterized by some effective temperature .",
    "we will show that the characteristics of collective behaviour can be associated with these temperatures .      at the single particle level , we follow the abp model @xcite . here",
    ", we consider the motion in two dimensions .",
    "the motion of an individual particle @xmath0 is determined by the langevin equation for the velocity with an added thrust term @xmath1 for simplicity , we will always set the particle mass @xmath2 to unity . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) is the standard langevin friction force . here , @xmath3 is the coefficient of viscous friction , which is set by the properties of the _ environment _ and the particle geometry , @xmath4 is the velocity of particle @xmath0 .",
    "second term is a random force of strength @xmath5 and @xmath6 is representing gaussian white noise with zero - mean and unit variance .",
    "the strength of the noise is set by the fluctuation - dissipation relation at the ambient temperature @xmath7 @xmath8 where the temperature is expressed in energy units @xmath9 . in the following",
    ", we will use energy units for temperature .",
    "we should stress that the fluctuations introduced in eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) act on each particle at all times and depend neither on the particle s speed nor on direction of motion . here ,",
    "as we assume a fixed incoming power , this noise is determined by the characteristics of the environment .",
    "this definition can , however , be generalized to include the fluctuations of the incoming power or thrust force .",
    "such situation can be realized in systems of chemically propelled particles @xcite .",
    "if this power is normally distributed , the behaviour of abp will be qualitatively identical to the model with constant @xmath10 but with a redefined temperature @xmath7 that would reflect the net amount of noise at the single - particle level @xcite .",
    "the thrust term @xmath11 ( eq . ( [ langevin ] ) ) in the depot model has the form @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the constant determining the rate of conversion of internal energy of the active agent into kinetic energy , @xmath14 is the parameter setting the internal energy dissipation rate , and @xmath10 is the constant determining the rate of energy influx from the environment .",
    "the steady state motion of the active particles is characterized by velocity @xmath15 , which is defined through the system s parameters as @xmath16 at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the steady state velocity distribution for various @xmath10 is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : veld_q ] . at @xmath18",
    "we observe the maxwell s distribution of the velocities corresponding to the system s temperature @xmath7 , while at non - zero energy influx rates we see either a broadened distribution centered at zero ( at @xmath19 ) or two bell - like peaks around the stationary velocity @xmath20 with the peak width controlled by the temperature .    , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "_ inset : _ bifurcation diagram for the stationary velocity @xmath23 as a function of @xmath10.,width=268 ]    thus , the model exhibits a transition from dissipative to driven regime upon increase of the energy influx rate @xmath10 @xcite and contains two well known limiting forms : rayleigh ( dissipative regime at low @xmath10 ) and schienbein - gruler ( driven regime at high @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "although the collective dynamics is observed only in the driven regime , we use the most general expression for the thrust term to demonstrate the flexibility of the model .",
    "we also note that the phenomenology of the order - disorder transition is not sensitive to the details of this term .",
    "the collective behaviour is impossible without interactions .",
    "while one can expect some swarming ( particle clustering ) already with isotropic central interactions , the global symmetry breaking and onset of directed transport requires that particle velocities are aligned .",
    "here we should note that a spontaneous transition into a globally aligned state is impossible in an equilibrium system with perfectly elastic collisions and without any dissipation due to conservation of the total linear momentum .",
    "the local alignment can be realised by different means , the best known example being the vicsek model , where particles are aligned to the local mean velocity field @xcite .",
    "another example of the aligning interaction is the hydrodynamic interaction of fluid molecules , solute particles , or swimmers @xcite . at the microscopic level ,",
    "the onset of hydrodynamic behaviour is achieved by suppressing the relative motion of the neighbouring particles with a friction force and preserving the local mean velocity . as a result",
    ", the fluid quickly relaxes to the stationary state .",
    "this idea is realised in a number of mesoscale simulation methods , which are known to produce correct hydrodynamics : lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method @xcite , mpcd , and dpd . in the lb and mpcd implementations ,",
    "the collisions are collective , similar to the vicsek model , while in dpd the friction force is pairwise and is applied to each pair of colliding particles @xcite .",
    "so , the latter method is ideally suited for our purpose as it presents a simple way to control the strength of the aligning interaction and relate it to other system s parameters .    here",
    ", we introduce a dissipative force between the abps in the same way as it is done in the dpd method .",
    "the total force @xmath24 acting on each particle is then given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the force that comes from interactions within the swarm .",
    "@xmath26 consists of three parts : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 represent the conservative , dissipative , and random forces between particles @xmath0 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the conservative force that reflects the excluded volume interactions is defined as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a non - negative ( repulsive ) scalar function determining the distance dependence of the repulsion , @xmath34 is the distance between particles @xmath0 and @xmath31 , @xmath35 is its magnitude , and @xmath36 is the unit vector from @xmath31 to @xmath0 .",
    "we choose @xmath33 to describe a soft repulsion : @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is a parameter determining the maximum repulsion force between the particles , @xmath39 is the radius of the repulsion zone . in the following",
    ", we will assume @xmath40 , so that the radius of repulsion , which can be interpreted as the body size of the active object , sets also a natural lengthscale of the problem .",
    "the dissipative force suppresses the velocity differences between the neighbouring particles and , therefore , provides a mechanism of relaxation of the velocity field toward the stationary state .",
    "we take it in the form of a friction force applied to the component of the motion in the direction of the particle connecting vector , i.e. a speed adjustment for particles moving together in the same direction : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the relative velocity of particles @xmath0 and @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , the friction can be applied to the motion perpendicular to the connecting vector @xcite , in which case it will predominantly act as an aligning interaction . in both cases , the parameter @xmath43 controls the dissipative strength of the interaction and by varying it we can accelerate or delay the alignment .",
    "the non - conservative part of the dpd force can be used as a thermostat @xcite . in this case",
    ", the stochastic force @xmath30 must be set to compensate the loss of kinetic energy due to the dissipative force .",
    "it provides random \" kicks  in the radial direction @xmath44 causing misalignment of particle velocities .",
    "@xmath45 where @xmath46 determines the strength of stochastic contribution to interactions , and @xmath47 is a random variable with a gaussian distribution and unit variance . in hydrodynamic simulations",
    ", it is usually required that the noise @xmath48 is symmetric in @xmath49 , the kicks satisfy newton s third law and conserve total momentum @xcite .",
    "this requirement , however , can be omitted for active particles .",
    "the interactions can involve complex internal mechanisms of reorientation ( like , for instance , contact inhibition of locomotion - rearrangement of actin protrusions of motile cells @xcite ) , which do not conserve linear momentum .",
    "we should stress that in this work we do not enforce the momentum conservation .",
    "moreover , although we study the onset of collective behaviour of the swarm , the interactions between the active particles are not mimicking the long - range hydrodynamic interaction of microswimmers as can be represented , for example , by force dipoles @xcite .    despite the non - thermal nature of the interaction noise defined by eq .",
    "( [ stoch_force ] ) , we can define a swarm temperature , @xmath50 , using the standard fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath51 in eqs .",
    "( [ dis_force])-([stoch_force ] ) , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are weight functions addition of which lets us ensure that the fluctuation - dissipation relation holds @xcite .",
    "for simplicity @xmath52 and @xmath53 are defined as : @xmath54 ^ 2=\\begin{cases } \\left ( 1-\\displaystyle \\frac{r}{r_c } \\right ) ^2 , &   r\\leq r_r \\\\ 0 , &   r_r < r < r_c \\end{cases } } , \\label{weight_f}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the interaction cut - off distance . in this model",
    ", we can regulate the interparticle interaction by changing the effective temperature , @xmath50 , and the friction coefficient , @xmath43 .",
    "this effective temperature determines the average degree of alignment the system can tolerate , while the friction coefficient determines the dissipative strength of a single collision and the speed of relaxation toward the stationary state .",
    "note that in this case the friction and the noise depend on the particle relative position and velocities .",
    "clearly , the global ordering should depend on both types of fluctuations , individual ( coming from the environment or energy influx ) and pairwise , as given by eq .",
    "( [ stoch_force ] ) .",
    "the whole set of the dpd terms thus reflects the behavioural contributions to the motion . for an animal or robotic systems it amounts to respecting the excluded volume and adjusting the motion to the neighbours .",
    "the stochastic term in this context plays a role of angular noise or errors of alignment of the agents to their neighbours direction of motion .",
    "we used a two - dimensional system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the primary box size was fixed at @xmath56 units and we varied the number of particles in the interval from 500 to 50000 to set the required density @xmath57 .",
    "simulations were performed with time step of @xmath58 .",
    "particles were propagated using the verlet algorithm @xcite : @xmath59 the velocities of particles were calculated using strmer - verlet method : @xmath60 total number of time steps in each run was @xmath61 .",
    "the statistics was collected in the steady state and each characteristic of motion was calculated by averaging over 5 independent runs .",
    "all simulations were performed with the following set of key parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 . throughout the paper we also use @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath22 , except where noted otherwise . to set the unit of time in our simulations , we choose a unit speed @xmath69 such that a particle moving at @xmath70 would make a distance @xmath39 per unit time ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : veld_q ] ) . this definition can be reformulated in terms of kinetic energy : our simulation units are such that an active particle moving at a speed of one body radius per unit time would have a kinetic energy @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , a temperature @xmath22 in our settings means that the root - mean - square speed of particles without propulsion ( @xmath18 ) is @xmath72 , i.e. 0.548 body radii per unit time .",
    "other parameters of the abp - dpd model were chosen to make the dynamic features around the order - disorder transition clearer .",
    "we note that qualitatively the dynamic behaviour of the swarms does not change significantly in the wide range of parameters and the only essential requirements are the onset of the driven regime and the presence of aligning interactions .    to characterise the collective motion in our model we use two different velocity correlation functions .",
    "the velocity autocorrelation function is calculated as @xmath73 where @xmath74 stands for the ensemble average .",
    "the two - point velocity correlation function is calculated as @xmath75 where @xmath0 and @xmath31 label particles separated by distance @xmath76 . with this definition , two particles with parallel ( antiparallel ) velocities give a correlation of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the angular brackets denote the ensemble average . to characterise the swarming behaviour of the particles we also perform a cluster analysis .",
    "cluster in our model is defined as a group of particles with a distance between neighbours smaller or equal to the cut - off radius @xmath55 , therefore , particles interacting directly or via neighbouring agents are included into one cluster .",
    "we calculate the number of clusters and mean cluster size .",
    "we characterise the orientational ordering by the polar order parameter , which quantifies the alignment of the particle motion to the average instantaneous velocity vector @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the angle between the velocity of particle @xmath0 and instantaneous average direction of motion of all agents .",
    "this order parameter has been extensively used to describe the orientational ordering in various systems of self - propelled particles @xcite .",
    "it turns zero in the isotropic phase and finite positive values in the ordered phase , which makes it easy to detect the transition .    to locate transition points precisely we also calculated the binder cumulant",
    "@xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 stands for the time average and @xmath83 denotes the value calculated in a system of size @xmath83 .",
    "the most important property of the binder cumulant is a very weak dependence on the system size so @xmath84 takes a universal value at the critical point , which can be found as the intersection of all the curves @xmath84 obtained at different system sizes @xmath83 @xcite at fixed density . to detect the transition points in @xmath85 plane",
    "precisely we plot three curves for different @xmath83 at constant density and find the point where they cross each other .",
    "then , we use those points to construct the phase diagram .",
    "we will illustrate the collective dynamics in our model by sequentially changing one of the two main parameters : the density @xmath57 and the parameter controlling energy influx rate , @xmath10 , which therefore determines the average propulsion speed of the particles . in fig .",

    "indeed , in the main plot we see that the mean order parameter is also growing larger with @xmath43 .    .",

    "[ fig : dif_t ] illustrates the role of the swarm temperature @xmath50 .",
    "the swarm temperature in our model can be defined via a fluctuation - dissipation relation for the parameters of the pairwise interaction , noise , and the friction coefficient , as given by the eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) . in terms of the temperature",
    ", the transition looks completely analogous to what is usually seen in the magnetic systems . at zero temperature ,",
    "the ordering is maximal , while it is suppressed by the fluctuations and vanishes at certain maximal temperature @xmath134 , which is getting higher at the higher input power @xmath10 .",
    "the order parameter approaches zero according to a power law @xmath135 with @xmath136=0.52 for @xmath107 , @xmath137 for @xmath112 , and @xmath138 for @xmath114 , which is in agreement with the critical exponent @xmath136 reported earlier for the vicsek model and other models with aligning interactions @xcite .",
    "( @xmath67 , @xmath105 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the power law fit to the points left of the transition temperatures.,width=260 ]",
    "as we can see from the numerical data , a system of abps with dissipative interactions indeed demonstrates the same qualitative properties as the well studied vicsek model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to most previous approaches , here we have separated two influences on the particle motion : the effect of the environment , which is introduced through the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) , and the effect of the other active agents , where the interactions are set by a separate pairwise dissipative parameter .",
    "both effects can be associated with a temperature , corresponding noise , and a friction parameter that control the rate of dissipation .",
    "note that these two types of noise and dissipation have different influence on the system .",
    "the former one is acting even on single particles , while the latter applies only to pairs and vanishes for single agents . at zero temperature of the environment , @xmath139",
    ", the model reduces to the motion with a constant speed , usually referred to as self - propelled particles , as for instance in the vicsek model .",
    "this regime would correspond in reality to a motion of macroscopic animals such that the thermal fluctuations are negligible . at @xmath68",
    ", we have a system with aligning inelastic collisions but without the corresponding noise in alignment . as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : dif_gamma ] , the pairwise friction that scales the dissipation power in the collisions can be used to regulate the degree of alignment in the system , which is expressed as the mean order parameter .",
    "thus , our model allows one to mix these contributions in different proportions and model different swarming scenarios .",
    "now , we would like to discuss the extent of the differences and similarities of the swarming behaviour in our model to observations from the vicsek model in more detail .",
    "the main difference of the present analysis from the previous studies is that in our simulations we assumed a constant noise , as it is associated with the action of the environment , and followed the phenomenon as a function of the propulsive power of the particles .",
    "this path , however , can also be mapped onto a situation with a fixed particle speed and a variable noise . in static isolated systems ,",
    "the ratio of the characteristic interaction energy to the thermal energy completely determines the equilibrium state . in the swarm of active particles ,",
    "the crucial number is the ratio of the stationary velocity due to propulsion to the characteristic velocity due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "this ratio can be written as @xmath140 where we used the relation between the friction and the relaxation time in the langevin equation , @xmath141 , and the equipartition relation , @xmath142 .",
    "thus , the ratio in question is equivalent to the incoming energy within the characteristic relaxation time , @xmath143 , to the thermal energy . in case",
    "the noise level is fixed by @xmath7 , it is the stationary particle speed that matters .",
    "the mean speed in the abp model at large @xmath10 is given by @xmath144 . at higher temperatures of the environment",
    ", one needs to pump in more energy to produce the same ratio of the characteristic speeds .",
    "this point is confirmed by the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] . in case",
    "the stationary speed is fixed , one needs to reduce the temperature , which is , in the langevin or dpd models , proportional to the fluctuation amplitude @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , the phase diagram in terms of noise amplitude @xmath145 vs density @xmath57 or @xmath7 vs @xmath57 will be inverse of our diagram shown in fig . [",
    "fig : phasediag ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sum of the critical swarm temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dif_t ] , and the ambient temperature @xmath7 is roughly proportional to the energy influx rate . here",
    ", we have @xmath146 for @xmath107 , @xmath147 for @xmath112 , and @xmath148 for @xmath114 .",
    "so , the fluctuations of different nature simply add up to increase the effective swarm s temperature , which can be defined as @xmath149 so that the ratio @xmath150 is about 1.5 in all cases .",
    "this idea is supported also by the phase diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] , where two systems with equal values of @xmath151 demonstrate a transition at nearly the same @xmath10 and @xmath57 . in what regards the meaning of the temperatures entering this relation",
    ", we should note that although we assumed the noise in the langevin equation strictly bound to ambient temperature , i.e. passive in nature , in some systems this term could be a combination of passive and active contributions so that the net magnitude of fluctuations corresponds to some effective temperature @xcite .",
    "finally , we should also note that in this formulation the relation between the swarming phenomenon and spontaneous symmetry breaking in dissipative systems upon increase of the energy influx rate becomes more obvious @xcite .",
    "we hope to explore this relation in more detail in the future .    in simulations ,",
    "we observe aggregation and orientational ordering of abp at sufficiently high densities in presence of sufficiently high propulsive power . at the fixed level of noise and propulsive power",
    ", the cluster size grows with the particle concentration in the same way as we observed previously for the vicsek model @xcite .",
    "thus , the dissipative interactions as well lead to cohesion of active particles .",
    "secondly , they lead to particle alignment as can be seen from the growth of the order parameter with concentration , again , similar to the dependence seen in the vicsek model . the transition into the orientationally ordered phase happens across the line @xmath152 , which is an inverse of the transition line for the vicsek model , where it happens at @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the noise amplitude @xcite .",
    "this power law behaviour seems to be not unique to the vicsek model , but a universal property of systems with global alignment and has been reported also for systems with pairwise aligning interactions ( with an exponent @xmath155 ) @xcite .    in what regards other properties",
    ", we should mention the behaviour of the correlations functions @xmath87 and @xmath91 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : param_q ] and [ fig : param_rho ] ) , which demonstrate the same qualitative features as the vicsek model we studied previously @xcite .",
    "the two - point velocity correlation function changes the shape from exponential to a power law at the critical point and inside the whole region of the ordered behaviour .",
    "the exponent @xmath156 , which describes the decay of @xmath157 in the ordered phase , takes the same values from 0.5 to 0.97 on increasing density and shows the same density dependence as we previously saw in the vicsek - type model @xcite .",
    "it seems to be insensitive to other details of the system and reflects just the symmetry of the system . at the transition point",
    ", the exponent is expected to satisfy the fisher s scaling law : @xmath158 @xcite , where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the critical exponents for isothermal susceptibility and the fluctuation correlation radius . in the limit of low concentrations , where the repulsions are not important ,",
    "we have @xmath161 , thus @xmath162 , which is in agreement with the result for @xmath163 obtained previously for the standard 2d vicsek model @xcite .",
    "moreover , the shape of the cluster size distributions as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : clstat_q ] and [ fig : clstat_rho ] in our model is also identical to that for the vicsek model ranging from @xmath164 to @xmath165 depending on the level of noise and the density @xcite .",
    "although the type of active particle , the interactions and the type of noise differ from those in the vicsek model , the identical values of the exponents suggest that our model belongs to the same universality class @xcite .",
    "we have studied dynamic self - organisation in a model combining the active brownian particles with dissipative particle interactions , which are introduced via inelastic collisions .",
    "we found that the abp - dpd model exhibits an orientational order - disorder transition on increasing energy influx rate or particle number density , which is completely analogous to that in the vicsek model , although the alignment mechanism in our model is completely different and the particle speeds are not constant .",
    "moreover , the abp - dpd system demonstrates the critical behaviour , which is identical to that of the vicsek model .",
    "we have shown that the amount of ordering of such an active system can be characterized by effective temperatures of the environment and of the swarm and the ratio of the characteristic thermal energy to the energy influx per particle .",
