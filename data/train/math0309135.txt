    "figure [ toad ] shows two of the 64 different ways of tiling an order three aztec diamond with dominoes .",
    "aztec diamonds are defined in `` alternating - sign matrices and domino tilings , '' by elkies , kuperberg , larsen , and propp @xcite .",
    "each tiling will be referred to as a toad , a tiling of an aztec diamond . in all of the illustrations",
    ", we have rotated the aztec diamonds and drawn spurs on each corner to simplify later calculations .",
    "an alternating sign matrix ( asm ) is a square matrix whose entries are @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 , such that the entries of each row or column must add up to @xmath1 , and all nonzero entries must alternate in sign .",
    "examples : @xmath3    elkies , kuperberg , larsen , and propp showed that there are @xmath4 tilings of an order @xmath5 aztec diamond with dominoes @xcite . as part of their proof , they used a relationship between toads and pairs of comatable asms . _ compatibility _ of asms was defined by robbins and rumsey in terms of the asms themselves , without reference to domino tilings @xcite .",
    "the interior vertices of an order @xmath5 toad are arranged as a @xmath5-by-@xmath5 square matrix inside an @xmath6-by-@xmath6 matrix .",
    "each interior vertex is connected to two or more of its four nearest neighbors .",
    "for the smaller square assign a @xmath0 to each vertex incident to exactly three edges , a @xmath1 to each vertex incident to exactly two edges , and a @xmath2 to each vertex incident to exactly four edges .",
    "for the larger matrix , do the same thing , but reverse the roles of @xmath1 s and @xmath2 s .",
    "the two above examples of asms come from the aztec diamond in figure [ asmtoad ] .",
    "a pair of asms of order @xmath5 and order @xmath7 is said to be compatible if there is a toad that is related to the pair by the above algorithm .",
    "a pair of compatible asms uniquely determines a toad .",
    "it has been shown that an order @xmath7 asm with @xmath8 @xmath2 s is compatible with @xmath9 order @xmath5 asms .",
    "consequently an asm with no @xmath2 s is only compatible with one smaller asm .",
    "an asm with no @xmath2 s is a permutation matrix .",
    "the study of baxter permutations began outside of the field of combinatorics @xcite , and even though they show up many places , it was surprising to find a connection between domino tilings and baxter permutations .",
    "we will give two definitions of baxter permutations .",
    "the latter follows from the former and is described in terms of permutation matrices .",
    "a permutation @xmath10 of @xmath5 objects is a baxter permutation if for each @xmath11 , there is a @xmath12 such that @xmath13 is between @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( allowing @xmath12 to be @xmath16 but not @xmath17 ) and for every @xmath18 between @xmath14 and @xmath13 ( including @xmath13 ) , @xmath19 , and for every @xmath18 between @xmath13 and @xmath15 ( not including @xmath13 ) , @xmath20 @xcite .    the easiest way to understand this definition is by looking at at a permutation matrix .",
    "let @xmath21 be a permutation matrix . by definition ,",
    "each row and each column of @xmath21 contains exactly one entry that is a 1 : for each @xmath16 , @xmath22 and the rest are zeros .",
    "take any two adjacent rows in @xmath21 , the @xmath16th and @xmath23th . then @xmath24 .",
    "then , we look at the columns between the @xmath14th column and the @xmath15th column",
    ".    if the permutation is baxter then there will be a vertical dividing line between two of these columns , so that every 1 on the @xmath15 side of the line is in a row below the @xmath17th row , and every 1 on the @xmath14 side of the line is in a row above the @xmath16th row .",
    "for example , let us test permutation 45123 between the second and third rows : @xmath25 because there is a place to draw a vertical line between columns 1 and 5 , this matrix passes the test for @xmath26 .",
    "since it passes the test for each of the other rows as well , it is baxter .",
    "now we are ready to present our theorem , which we will prove in section [ proof ] :    [ bpth ] an order @xmath6 asm without @xmath2 s is compatible with an order @xmath5 asm without @xmath2 s if and only if it is a baxter permutation matrix .    as a consequence of this theorem",
    ", we know the number of order @xmath5 toads with the property that vertices corresponding to the smaller asm never have four edges incident to them , and vertices corresponding to the larger asm never have two edges incident to them .",
    "that number is the same as the number of baxter permutations of order @xmath7 , which is given by chung , graham , hoggatt , and kleiman @xcite .",
    "the number of baxter permutations on order @xmath5 is @xmath27",
    "to prove theorem [ bpth ] , we will present an algorithm that will produce the smaller asm that is compatible with a given permutation matrix .",
    "the following lemma is a formal description of the algorithm .",
    "we will use the relationship between asms and aztec diamonds to prove the lemma by the end of section [ sasm ] .",
    "[ alg ] if @xmath21 is an order @xmath7 permutation matrix , and @xmath28 is the order @xmath5 asm that is compatible with @xmath21 , then @xmath29 if and only if @xmath30 or @xmath31 or @xmath32 or @xmath33 . the nonzero elements of @xmath28 alternate between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we will use an example to show how to apply the algorithm .",
    "suppose we are given the permutation 31425 .",
    "first , let us define the matrix @xmath21 which corresponds to our permutation .",
    "@xmath34    now draw the smaller matrix @xmath28 interspersed within @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath35    from the description of the algorithm in lemma [ alg ] , @xmath36 because @xmath37 and @xmath38 because @xmath39 and @xmath40 because @xmath41 .",
    "repeated applications of this method will give : @xmath42 @xmath43 graphically :    @xmath44    lemma [ alg ] tells us that the other elements@xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50are nonzero and alternate between 1 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath51    the proof of lemma [ alg ] comes in two parts .",
    "first we show that entries in @xmath28 that have a certain property are equal to 0 .",
    "second , we show that entries that lack this property are nonzero .",
    "the values of the nonzero entries are given by the definition of an asm .",
    "first let us show that @xmath52 by induction on @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ varprop ] shows a situation where @xmath55 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath56 must be zero . to do this",
    ", we look at the positioning of the dominoes in the toad that corresponds to @xmath28 and @xmath21",
    ". the square located between the vertices of @xmath57 and @xmath58 must be part of a domino .",
    "since it is on the left edge of the aztec diamond , the domino must be pointing northeast or southeast .",
    "figure [ varprop ] shows both cases .",
    "the figure also shows the @xmath57 and @xmath58 vertices with three edges incident to them .",
    "either configuration leads to @xmath59 .    for the induction step choose any @xmath60 such that all of the @xmath61 s and @xmath62 s to the left of @xmath63 are zero .",
    "we assume not only that all of the @xmath64 s to the left of @xmath63 are zero , but also that the zig - zag shape from the far left edge of the aztec diamond has propagated inward towards the @xmath53th column .        since @xmath65 , both of these vertices meets exactly three edges . as figure [ induction ] shows , once we know the shape of the tiling to the left of @xmath63 , and that @xmath65 , we can determine the value of @xmath63 just as we determined the value of @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ prop ] shows that this induction can continue until we encounter a 1 .        in other words , 0",
    "s propagate from the edge of @xmath28 until they hit a nonzero entry in the surrounding rows and columns of @xmath21 .",
    "this proof can also be applied to the top , bottom , and right edges of the asms .",
    "then we have proved half of the lemma .",
    "to finish proving lemma [ alg ] , we will need to look at how the tiling patterns must propagate inside the matrix @xmath28 .",
    "we will concentrate on those elements of @xmath28 whose value is still undetermined . to represent those entries",
    ", we will use the symbol @xmath66 .",
    "we will now look at one individual row of @xmath28 , and look at the two rows of @xmath21 that are above and below it . here is an example : the second and third rows from the permutation 34215 .",
    "@xmath67 notice first that all of the unknown entries on any row in @xmath28 will be between the 1 s in the two closest rows of @xmath21 .",
    "as figure [ direction ] shows , a 0 will show up between the 1 s only if there is a vertical path of zeros from either the top edge or the bottom edge . in this example",
    ", the zero is there because of a path from the bottom edge .",
    "we can say that a @xmath66 arises when the columns of @xmath21 to the immediate left and right of the box have their 1 s in opposite directions , and that if these two columns of @xmath21 have their 1 s in the same direction , there is a 0 .",
    "@xmath68    our next example is the ( non - baxter ) permutation 3142 .",
    "we choose this because the second row of @xmath28 will have three @xmath66s .",
    "@xmath69 looking only at the center row , we can reconstruct where the 1 s are in @xmath21 : @xmath70 it can now be seen that there is an odd number of boxes in each row , because each box always corresponds to a switching in the direction of the 1 s , and the 1 on the left of the leftmost box must be in the direction opposite of the 1 in the column to the right of the rightmost box .",
    "consequently , @xmath66s can be in either of two configurations .",
    "the important thing is the direction of the 1 in the two adjacent rows and two adjacent columns of @xmath21 .",
    "there are only two types of configurations , up to various symmetries , as figure [ windmill ] illustrates .",
    "call the configuration represented by the one on the right _ windmilled _ , and the configuration represented by the one on the left _ non - windmilled_.    @xmath71    it can be seen that the @xmath66s along a row alternate between non - windmilled and windmilled , starting with a non - windmilled @xmath66 . it is claimed that the left configuration will lead to @xmath72 and the windmilled always lead to @xmath73 . to prove this , we will have to look at the tiling patterns between the 1 s in two consecutive rows of @xmath21 .      in this section",
    ", we will assume for a moment that we know the values of each entry in the @xmath16th row of @xmath28 and the @xmath16th and @xmath17th rows of @xmath21 .",
    "the reader might find it useful to generate example rows and try to draw the corresponding tilings .",
    "for example , these rows : @xmath74 will produce this partial tiling :        notice that in the interesting area  between the 1 s in @xmath21the tiling is uniquely determined by these three matrix rows .",
    "we will prove this , and use the machinery of the proof to show that @xmath66s are always non - zero .",
    "here are examples of how the titling patterns propagate from left to right .",
    "the arrows serve to highlight the change that @xmath1 s and @xmath2 s make to the pattern . * ( a ) * and * ( c ) * show configurations that go unchanged when they encounter a 0 in @xmath28 . *",
    "( b ) * and * ( d ) * show how encountering a 1 or a @xmath2 in @xmath28 changes the configuration . ]    figure [ fill ] shows how the tiling patterns that propagate in from the left side of the toad change first when they hit a 1 in @xmath21 and later when they hit 1 s and @xmath2 s in @xmath28 .",
    "notice that in between the two 1 s in @xmath21 , the tiling can take on one of two patterns : one will happen if the next nonzero element to the right in @xmath28 is @xmath1 , and the other will happen if if the next nonzero element to the right is @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ rl ] shows the two patterns .",
    "once we are to the right of a 1 in @xmath21 , the tiling can have two patterns , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath75 corresponds to having the closest non - zero @xmath28 entry on the left being 1 , and @xmath76 corresponds to being on the right of a 1 in @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath76 and @xmath75 fit together one way , there is a @xmath2 in between .",
    "if they are fit together the other way , there is a @xmath1 in between . ]    to help us keep this straight , the components in figures [ fill ] and [ rl ] have an arrow that points to the right if the next nonzero element on the right in @xmath28 is 1 , and to the left if the next nonzero element on the left in @xmath28 is a 1 .",
    "for example , look at this row from an asm , with the arrows filled in .",
    "@xmath77    suppose that this row had been determined by a larger permutation matrix it was compatible with .",
    "here is what might look like :    @xmath78     +        the last picture shows the tiling broken into components . notice that the components between the 1 s in @xmath21 are all the same , up to a rotation .",
    "each rotation corresponds to a nonzero element in the asm @xmath28 that fits between the two components .",
    "this constitutes an algorithm to determine the shape of the local tiling from the two asms .",
    "now we have assembled all of the tools necessary to finish proving lemma [ alg ] .",
    "we know that the @xmath66s alternate between two configurations : windmilled and non - windmilled ; if we were to show that the windmilled boxes can not contain 1 s or 0 s , then the sign - alternation property of @xmath28 would force the non - windmilled boxes to contain 1 s , and the lemma would be proved",
    ".      here is what a windmilled configuration looks like , up to reflection .",
    "@xmath79    let us assume that @xmath80 , and find a contradiction .",
    "the contradiction arises when we try to draw the tiling components that correspond to the arrows that point towards the 1 .",
    "@xmath81 but the next figure shows that the tilings that result from looking at the column and the row do nt match , so we have a contradiction .        let us now assume that @xmath82 , and find a contradiction . if we have a 0 in @xmath28 , then the arrows on either side point in the same direction .",
    "this is true for the arrows in the row and in the column . in the next figure , we have chosen to make the arrows point up and to the left . because of symmetry , we will get the same result for any equivalent configuration . @xmath83",
    "but the next figure shows that the tilings that result from looking at the column and the row do nt match , so we have a contradiction .",
    "this concludes our proof of lemma [ alg ] .",
    "with an algorithm in hand that will produce the unique order @xmath5 asm that is compatible with an order @xmath7 permutation matrix , we are prepared to show that the conditions in the permutation that produce @xmath2 s in the smaller asm are identical to the conditions that would prevent that permutation from being baxter .",
    "first , assume that a permutation @xmath21 is compatible with a smaller asm @xmath28 that contains no @xmath2 s .",
    "if @xmath28 it contains no @xmath2 s then each row of @xmath28 must contain exactly one @xmath66 .",
    "remember that the @xmath66 represents the place where the direction that the 1 s of @xmath21 are located switches from up to down or down to up .",
    "then for each row , the location of the @xmath66 is the natural place to draw a dividing line between the columns to pass the baxter test .",
    "consequently , @xmath21 is baxter .",
    "assume that a permutation @xmath21 is compatible with a smaller asm @xmath28 that contains at least one @xmath2 .",
    "the row of @xmath28 that contains the @xmath2 has at least three @xmath66s , and consequently , has no natural place to draw the dividing line between columns .",
    "let us show that this will keep @xmath21 from being baxter . from our earlier discussion",
    ", it is apparent that @xmath21 contains a windmilled configuration of 1 s .",
    "@xmath84 it is easily checked that a permutation that looks like this is not baxter , because there can be no vertical dividing line between columns that properly segregates the 1 s into two groups .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem [ bpth ] .",
    "i would like to thank james propp for counting pairs of compatible permutation matrices for small values of @xmath5 , for making the conjecture about the connection with baxter permutations , and for bringing the problem to my attention .",
    "the other members of the spatial systems lab at the university of wisconsin - madison also deserve thanks for their help and support with this proof and with this paper , especially dominic johann - berkel for finding out what a baxter permutation was ."
