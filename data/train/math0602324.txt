    "gromov - witten invariants compute `` numbers of pseudo - holomorphic curves '' in a symplectic manifold .",
    "they are rigorously defined as integrals on moduli spaces of stable maps .",
    "therefore it is difficult to calculate gromov - witten invariants directly from the definition .",
    "an alternative method of computation comes from mirror symmetry .",
    "although the mirror symmetry phenomenon is not yet completely understood , it suggests that gromov - witten invariants can be computed in terms of coefficients of power series solutions of certain differential equations .",
    "the most well known example is the quintic hypersurface in @xmath0 ; this is a calabi - yau 3-fold .",
    "fano hypersurfaces are more elementary from the point of view of gromov - witten invariants , and it was established by givental that the gromov - witten invariants in this case are determined by the `` picard - fuchs equation '' . the picard - fuchs equation of the quintic hypersurfaces in @xmath0 is @xmath1 .",
    "a hypersurface @xmath2 of degree @xmath3 in @xmath4 is fano if and only if @xmath5 , and the picard - fuchs equation is @xmath6 before givental s work , partial results on the quantum cohomology of fano hypersurfaces had been obtained by collino - jinzenji ( @xcite ) and beauville ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , jinzenji ( @xcite ) observed that a simple ansatz leads to the correct gromov - witten invariants and he obtained complicated but explicit formulae from this ansatz .",

    ". we shall show ( as a consequence of givental s work ) that this method produces the correct @xmath7-point gromov - witten invariants .    the algorithm for the computation of @xmath7-point gromov - witten invariants from the quantum differential equations",
    "was introduced in @xcite , and applied to flag manifolds in @xcite , and our treatment of hypersurfaces is broadly similar . however , there are some special features in this case , which makes a separate discussion worthwhile . first , the differential equations in this case is are o.d.e .",
    ", rather than p.d.e .",
    ", hence the integrability condition plays no role .",
    "second , the o.d.e . which appears in the birkhoff factorization",
    "can be integrated very explicitly , and this leads to purely algebraic formulae ( whereas the algorithm in @xcite required the solution of large systems of p.d.e . ) .",
    "computationally , our method is similar to jinzenji s method , but considerably simpler . in ",
    "@xmath10 we review the definitions of the gromov - witten invariants , the quantum cohomology ring , and the dubrovin connection . in  @xmath7 we discuss the quantum cohomology of fano hypersurfaces . the quantum differential system and an example of jinzenji s results are discussed in  @xmath11 . in ",
