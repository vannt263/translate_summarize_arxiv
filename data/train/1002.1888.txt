    "the electronic structure of nanoscale graphene has been the subject of intensive research during the last years because of fundamental scientific interest in nanomaterials . with the developments in preparation and synthesis techniques",
    "carbon - based nanostructures have emerged as one of the most promising materials for non silicon electronics .",
    "graphene nanoflakes are either semiconductors or conductors aiming to the geometry of their boundaries @xcite .",
    "several studies have been published on graphene nanoflakes doped with impurities @xcite .",
    "we decided here to compute the @xmath3 and @xmath4 electrons density of states of graphene nanoflakes doped with a small percentage of either @xmath2 atoms or with @xmath1 hybridized @xmath0 atoms .",
    "we show here numerical results on the conductivity of graphene nanoflakes and on the density of states ( mainly the fermi level ) of impurities - doped graphene nanoflakes .",
    "our numerical method allows us to take into account the @xmath3 as well as the @xmath4 for the calculation of the electronic density of states . and",
    "moreover , this method allows one to separate the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 density of states .",
    "let us remind that this is a one electron model , each electron moves in a potential @xmath6 which represents both the nuclei attraction and the repulsion of the other electrons .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath3 electrons are separately treated .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath4 bonds may be written as : @xmath7 where the molecular orbital @xmath4 is given by : @xmath8 with @xmath9 the hybrid @xmath5 orbital ( @xmath10 ) which points from site @xmath11 along the bond @xmath12 ; the energy origin is taken at the vacuum level . @xmath11 and @xmath13 are first neighbours with @xmath14 the average energy : @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the atomic energy levels ; @xmath18 is the usual hopping or resonance integral in the tight binding theory ( interaction between nearest neighbour atoms along the bond ) ; @xmath19 is a promotion integral ( transfer between hybrid orbitals on the same site ) : @xmath20 .    for an infinite three dimensional crystal ( bulk ) , the gap between valence and conduction band ( forbidden band ) is @xmath21 ( for vib elements ) and @xmath22 may be derived from the values of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath3 bonds is : @xmath24 with @xmath25 the @xmath3 orbitals centered on atoms @xmath11 and @xmath26 is the hopping integral for @xmath3 levels .",
    "the @xmath26 value for @xmath0 was chosen in order to get the correct positions for @xmath27 energy levels in comparison to the results of the verhaegen s ab initio calculations @xcite .",
    "we need only three parameters:@xmath18 , @xmath26 and @xmath19 for the homonuclear model which represent in fact the average potential @xmath6 and which take into account the nuclear attraction and the dielectronic attraction @xcite .",
    "the values of these three parameters are given in table i.",
    "we computed the density of states of pure and doped graphene nanoflakes .",
    "the nanoflakes have boundaries represented in figure 1 .",
    "we studied nanoflakes containing 480 , 720 and 960 atoms : we obtained their geometry by reproducing figure 1 in the @xmath28 direction .    in figure 2",
    ", one may see the density of states of nanoflakes of graphene containing 480 atoms .",
    "the nanoflakes are isolated , i.e. they are not connected to any other conducting material or connected to any substrate .",
    "the 3 graphs in figure 2 representing the dos ( density of states ) correspond to : ( a ) pure graphene nanoflake ( b ) 5% of si atoms randomly introduced in the graphene nanoflake and ( c ) 5% of @xmath1 hybridized carbon atoms randomly distributed within the nanoflake .",
    ", 10% , 15% and 20% .",
    "the boundaries of the nanoflakes correspond to the armchair geometry .",
    "figure 3 corresponds to the same nanoflakes ( i.e. pure , with 5% of @xmath2 atoms and with 5% of @xmath1 hybridized carbon atoms ) but in this case for 720 atoms .",
    "figure 4 corresponds also to 3 dos with the same nanoflakes but this time containing 960 atoms .",
    "it is possible to introduce impurities like @xmath2 atoms .",
    "carbon and silicon belong to the same column ivb of the periodic table . however , their structures in the solid states are different .",
    "carbon indeed can be found in several allotropic varieties such as diamond , graphite , graphene whereas silicon is always found in three dimensional systems .    in mixed silicon - carbon @xmath29 nanoclusters , it has been previously pointed out that experimental results show a progressive transition from a carbon type behaviour of si to a silicon type behaviour @xcite as the silicon richness is growing in the clusters @xcite .",
    "this may be transferred in nanoflakes to the percentage of @xmath2 : here we deal with small percentages of @xmath2 surrounded by 95% of @xmath0 at least . from references @xcite we may say that due to the richness in carbon atoms in the studied nanoflakes of graphene , the @xmath2 atoms adopt the carbon behaviour i.e. are in the @xmath30 hybridization .",
    "it is worth noticing that for small and finite size nanoflakes , the dos consists of many discrete levels and instead of fermi level , one should speak of highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) .",
    "however , we retain these terms in a loose sense because the main result when comparing the three figures of dos for the nanoflakes of graphene of different sizes , we observe ( figures 2,3 and 4 ) that the fermi ( or homo ) level of the @xmath3 electrons dos correspond to the dos in the @xmath31 direction in the brillouin zone ( see for that reference @xcite .",
    "the fact is that for 480 atoms and 720 atoms of pure graphene ( figures 2(a ) and 3(a ) ) the dos shows that there is a gap between the @xmath3 fermi level and higher @xmath3 energy levels : this indicates that the nanoflake of pure @xmath0 atoms is semiconducting .",
    "this is in good agreement with the literature showing that with armchair boundaries ( which is the case in our nanoflakes ) semiconducting is generally obtained @xcite .    by doping the nanoflake with either @xmath2 atoms or by @xmath1 carbon atoms ,",
    "one destroys the semiconducting character .",
    "this is due to the fact that impurities remove the degeneracy of the energy levels .",
    "what is also interesting is that the @xmath3 fermi level and the whole fermi level are not superimposed for nanoflakes containing a small number of atoms ( 480 and 720 atoms : fig . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the superimposition only occurs for a larger number of atoms ( here 960 atoms : fig.4 ) . generally in the literature ,",
    "one studies the @xmath3 dos as the major numerical methods used by authors is the tight binding one taking only account of @xmath3 electrons . but here , we deal with @xmath4 and @xmath3 atoms , and when calculating the fermi the @xmath3 and the whole fermi level , these two do not superimpose , at least for a small number of atoms . but @xmath4 electrons do not enter in the conducting or semiconducting character of the sample .",
    "let us summarize the results : doping graphene nanoflakes with armchair boundaries removes the degeneracy of the energy levels in the dos and therefore removes the semiconducting character of graphene nanoflakes with this kind of boundaries ; the @xmath3 fermi level and joint @xmath3 and @xmath4 fermi level do not superimpose for small graphene nanoflakes : but as the @xmath4 electrons do not enter conduction this has no consequence on the electronic features of small graphene nanoflakes ."
