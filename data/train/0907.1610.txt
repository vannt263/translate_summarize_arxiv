    "it is well - known since the mid-1970 s that @xmath0 hyperons produced in unpolarized @xmath6 collisions are to a large degree polarized transversely to the production plane .",
    "there have been many experimental and theoretical investigations aimed at understanding this striking polarization phenomenon , but no consensus has been reached about its origin .",
    "one of the difficulties in interpreting the available ( mostly fixed target ) data is that they are not or only partially in a region where a factorized description of the cross section is expected to be applicable .",
    "high - energy hadron collider data would be very welcome , for instance from rhic , tevatron or lhc , but there the capabilities to measure @xmath0 polarization via the self - analyzing parity violating decay @xmath7 are typically restricted to the midrapidity region , where protons can be identified , but the degree of transverse polarization @xmath8 is expected to be very small . for symmetry reasons @xmath9 at midrapidity in @xmath6 collisions in the center of mass frame .",
    "nevertheless , some interesting @xmath0 polarization studies can be done using the process @xmath10 , where the @xmath0 and jets can be in the midrapidity region without paying a suppression penalty .",
    "it is especially of interest at lhc , where the asymmetry expressions may take a particularly simple form depending on the importance of gluons . also , transverse @xmath0 polarization measurements at forward rapidities at lhc will be discussed below , as it offers a promising way of extracting the @xmath11 dependence of the saturation scale .",
    "these two suggestions will hopefully enhance the interest in @xmath0 polarization measurements at high energy colliders , at lhc in particular .",
    "large asymmetries have been observed in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the main features of the asymmetry are : @xmath13 grows with @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) ; for @xmath16 it becomes flat ( measured up to @xmath17 gev / c ) ; no @xmath18 dependence has been seen . for a comprehensive review of data cf",
    ".  ref .",
    "many qcd - inspired models have been proposed to explain the transverse @xmath0 polarization data .",
    "most models give qualitative descriptions of the data for @xmath19 .",
    "however , @xmath8 stays large at least until the highest measured @xmath20 gev/@xmath21 . for sufficiently large @xmath22 perturbative qcd and collinear factorization should become applicable .",
    "consider for example the @xmath23 subprocess contribution to the @xmath24 cross section in collinear factorization .",
    "it is of the form : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the quark density in proton 1 , @xmath27 is the gluon density in proton 2 , and @xmath28 is the @xmath0 fragmentation function ( ff ) . in a similar way the transverse polarization should be of the form : @xmath29 , involving the unpolarized parton densities and the unpolarized hard partonic subprocess .",
    "the latter because @xmath0 polarization created in the helicity conserving hard partonic scattering is very small , @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the question mark indicates that at leading twist there is no collinear fragmentation function describing @xmath31 for symmetry reasons . in collinear factorization @xmath32",
    "is necessarily power suppressed .",
    "dropping the demand of _ collinear _ factorization , does allow for a leading twist solution : the function    @xmath33 @xcite for @xmath0 s , depicted in fig .",
    "[ d1tperp ] .",
    "it describes a nonperturbative @xmath34 dependence in the fragmentation process , which is allowed by the symmetries ( parity and time reversal ) . as the @xmath0 polarization arises in the fragmentation of an _",
    "unpolarized _ quark , the descriptive name `` polarizing fragmentation function '' was suggested for it @xcite .",
    "currently @xmath35 is expected to be universal , despite its potential color flow dependence @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 has been extracted from fixed target @xmath36 data @xcite .",
    "reasonable functions are obtained : @xmath37 has    opposite signs for @xmath38 versus @xmath39 quarks , and the latter is larger .",
    "this leads to cancellations in order that @xmath40 .",
    "this extraction has been done under the restriction of @xmath41 gev/@xmath21 to exclude the soft regime , but also to retain sufficient data to make a fit to . whether this restriction is sufficiently strict to ensure",
    "the validity of the description is a matter of concern , due to the large @xmath42 factors required to obtain a cross section description .",
    "the validity of the factorized description depends on whether a proper cross section description can be obtained .",
    "this requires data at higher @xmath18 and @xmath44 , but not necessarily also at large @xmath45 if one goes beyond @xmath46 .",
    "if the origin of the transverse @xmath0 polarization is indeed due to polarizing fragmentation , then another related asymmetry could be observed that does not need to vanish at @xmath47 , namely in the process @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the suggestion is to select two - jet events and to measure the jet momenta @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 ) , in addition to the momentum @xmath52 and polarization @xmath53 of the @xmath0 that is part of either of the two jets . a single spin asymmetry proportional to @xmath54",
    "can then arise , which is neither power suppressed , nor needs to be zero at midrapidity . in the center of mass frame of the two jets the asymmetry is of the form : @xmath55 the analyzing power @xmath56 of the asymmetry depends on @xmath37 .",
    "this new @xmath0+jets observable could allow for a more trustworthy extraction of @xmath37 ( for both quarks and gluons ) and subsequent predictions , for instance for semi - inclusive dis @xcite .    at lhc",
    "( and at rhic ) this process @xmath48 can be studied .",
    "for instance , alice with its excellent pid capabilities can measure @xmath0 s over a wide @xmath44 range ( for example , in a typical yearly heavy ion collision run at least up to 16 gev/@xmath21 ) .",
    "the alice rapidity coverage is @xmath57 .",
    "jets can be reconstructed above 30 gev ( up to 250 gev in a typical yearly run ) .",
    "if the jet rapidities ( @xmath58 ) are in this kinematic region and if gluon fragmentation is at least as important as quark fragmentation for both unpolarized and polarized @xmath0 production , then the process is dominated by gluon - gluon ( @xmath59 ) scattering holds throughout .",
    "furthermore , chiral - odd contributions @xcite will not be considered here . ] : @xmath60 because no model or fit for @xmath61 is available yet , no predictions can be made in this case .    if it happens that @xmath62 , then one can use the extracted @xmath63 to obtain an estimate . when gluons still dominate in the denominator ,",
    "one finds for @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) @xmath66 \\frac{\\sum_q f_1^q(x_1)d_{1t}^{\\perp\\,q}(z{,}k_{\\lambda\\,t}^2 ) } { f_1^g(x_1 ) d_1^g(z{,}k_{\\lambda\\,t}^2)}},\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . in the considered rapidity interval",
    "the prefactor @xmath70 is almost @xmath71 independent .    in practice",
    ", it may be that @xmath72 is considerably smaller than @xmath73 . in that case",
    "the @xmath74 subprocess needs to be taken into account in the denominator of the asymmetry too ( not done    l0.6        in @xcite ) . here",
    "we will use the dsv fragmentation functions of ref .",
    "@xcite which indeed has @xmath75 at larger @xmath76 . the asymmetry is given in fig .",
    "[ asymm ] for three different values of the @xmath0 momentum component transverse to the jet direction .",
    "for very low values of this @xmath77 the asymmetry at large @xmath76 exceeds -1 , which is unphysical .",
    "it signals a problem with the @xmath78-dependence of the function @xmath63 for which it was not properly taken into account that for each value of @xmath77 the positivity bound has to be satisfied @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it may be expected that the result at least has the generic shape for negligible @xmath61 .",
    "the asymmetry is quite sensitive to the cancellation between @xmath38 and @xmath39 contributions , like in sidis @xcite , and can even flip its overall sign depending on the amount of @xmath79 breaking in the unpolarized fragmentation functions ( dsv assumes @xmath79 symmetry ) .",
    "more reliable estimates are not possible at this stage .",
    "alice would have most data in the region @xmath80 and would therefore provide valuable information on gluonic contributions to @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath0 polarization is also very interesting in @xmath81 reactions at very high @xmath18 , large @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in that kinematic regime of small @xmath11 , saturation of the gluon density",
    "is expected .",
    "the process @xmath84 is sensitive to saturation and could help to determine properties of this phenomenon .",
    "none of the existing data is in the saturation regime . at high energy colliders , such as rhic and lhc ,",
    "protons often can not be identified in the forward direction , which hampers the measurement of @xmath0 polarization .",
    "although relatively forward @xmath0 s ( @xmath85 ) in @xmath86 collisions have been identified through event topology @xcite , it is not clear whether the polarization can be reconstructed in this way too , despite the self - analyzing decay property .",
    "an alternative may be to use neutral decays @xmath87    ( 50% less frequent than @xmath88 ) . despite being a very challenging measurement ,",
    "@xmath0 polarization at forward rapidities offers a unique direct probe of gluon saturation in both @xmath6 and @xmath89 collisions at lhc .",
    "the saturation scale @xmath90 and even its evolution with @xmath11 could be probed in this way @xcite .",
    "the cross section of forward hadron production in the ( near-)saturation regime is schematically of the form : pdf @xmath91 dipole cross section @xmath91 ff @xcite . since @xmath37 is @xmath92-odd , it essentially probes the derivative of the dipole cross section . at transverse momenta of order",
    "@xmath90 the dipole cross section changes much , which thus leads to a @xmath90-dependent peak in ( strictly speaking minus ) the @xmath0 polarization .",
    "this was first demonstrated in ref.@xcite for the mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite . in this model",
    "@xmath90 is a constant , leading to a peak that is @xmath45 independent . more realistically",
    "the saturation scale is expected to change with the small-@xmath11 values probed : @xmath93 .",
    "models that incorporate this are for instance : the well - known gbw model @xcite , which describes well small-@xmath11 dis data ; the dhj model @xcite , which describes well forward @xmath94 rhic data ; and , the gs model @xcite , which describes well both types of data . in all three models",
    "@xmath95 , as indicated by the dis data . here",
    "we will restrict to the latter two models .",
    "although they have considerable differences ( the gs model is geometrically scaling , the dhj model is not ; the gs model leads to more steeply falling @xmath44 spectra of produced hadrons ) @xcite , both the dhj and gs models lead to the same conclusion about the peak of the @xmath0 polarization : its @xmath45 dependence is to very good approximation the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath90 !",
    "this is shown in fig.[auplot ] for @xmath2 collisions at lhc ( the solid line is the gs model prediction , the dashed line the dhj one ) .    in @xmath6 collisions at lhc @xmath90 and hence the @xmath3 position of the peak is slightly lower . at rhic",
    "unfortunately the peak is likely situated below 1 gev/@xmath21 , where the formalism can not be trusted .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 polarization studies at lhc could prove most interesting .",
