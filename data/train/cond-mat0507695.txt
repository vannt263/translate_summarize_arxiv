    "it has been long appreciated that the low  temperature physics of generic disordered metals is characterized by a subtle interplay of electron  electron interactions and coherent disorder scattering .",
    "while both effects are of crucial importance , their unified treatment still evades a complete theoretical description .",
    "it is useful , thus , to approach them separately .",
    "the limiting case of `` coherence without interactions '' has been studied intensely .",
    "it is well understood that the coherent multiple scattering off impurities leads to anderson localization : in one and two dimensions all states are localized  @xcite . while in homogeneously disordered systems this phenomenon has always to be taken into account , granular systems admit for a parameter regime where the physics is entirely controlled by interaction effects .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to explore the regime of `` interactions without coherence '' accessible in metallic granular arrays .",
    "metallic granular arrays are also of great interest in their own right  @xcite . in particular , strongly coupled arrays ( @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is the dimensionless inter  grain conductance ) have become a subject of increased theoretical attention in recent years  @xcite .",
    "an isolated grain or quantum dot is characterized by three energy scales : the thouless energy @xmath4 , the charging energy @xmath5 , and the mean level spacing @xmath6 .",
    "the tunneling coupling between the grains adds another parameter : the dimensionless conductance @xmath0 of a contact between two neighboring grains . throughout this paper",
    "we focus on the regime , where the thouless energy @xmath4 is the largest energy scale .",
    "this allows one to treat each grain as a zero  dimensional object and disregard the intra  grain in comparison with the inter  grain resistance .",
    "the interaction effects are controlled by the charging energy @xmath5 ( in the simplest model @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the self  capacitance of a grain . ) in our studies it is the next largest energy scale in the system . finally , quantum coherence effects are governed by the energy scale(s ) @xmath9 .",
    "if such a scale is much smaller than all relevant temperatures , one may treat each grain as having a _ continuous _ spectrum .",
    "this assumption allows one to disregard phase coherence .",
    "in essence : an electron exiting a grain is never the same electron that has previously entered it .",
    "the parameter regime specified above justifies the `` interactions without coherence '' program .",
    "it is clear though , that such a simplification can not work down to the very smallest temperatures . at low enough temperature ,",
    "coherent propagation through multiple grains will become important and our approximation is bound to fail .",
    "it is , thus , important to realize that the subject of our considerations is a transient ( though possibly wide ) temperature range . in this range",

    "once they start to overlap , eq .",
    "( [ eq - res ] ) is not valid anymore . in 1d",
    "this happens at @xmath15 , where the conductivity smoothly crosses over to its high  temperature behavior  @xcite @xmath16 . in two dimensions ,",
    "the solitons interact logarithmically over a large range of distances .",
    "this leads to a berezinskii  kosterlitz  thouless ( bkt ) unbinding of soliton  anti - soliton pairs  @xcite at the temperature @xmath17 around this temperature the conductivity undergoes a sharp crossover from the exponentially small value given by @xmath18 , cf .",
    "( [ eq - res ] ) , up to the high  temperature asymptotics , @xmath19 . in the model with only mutual capacitances between neighboring grains",
    "the coulomb interaction is logarithmic at arbitrarily large distances .",
    "this results in a true bkt phase transition with zero conductivity below the transition point .",
    "the @xmath10 version of the latter model was previously considered in refs .",
    "the introduction of on  grain coulomb interactions transforms the transition into a crossover .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath1 the bkt remains sharp even for the pure on  grain ( self  capacitance only ) coulomb interactions .",
    "technically we approach the problem from two complimentary perspectives : the _ phase _ and the _ charge _ representations .",
    "the former is straightforwardly derived from the microscopic fermionic model  @xcite .",
    "it is commonly employed in the study of both homogenous and granular interacting systems .",
    "while being effective in the high  temperature regime , it becomes increasingly difficult to handle at lower temperatures . to treat this latter regime ,",
    "we employ the charge model , introduced previously within the context of quantum dot physics  @xcite .",
    "our main technical achievement is the proof of equivalence of these two approaches over a parametrically wide range of temperatures . for these temperatures ,",
    "both models may be handled in a _ controlled _ way .",
    "we thus conclude that the charge model , although not directly deduced from the microscopic hamiltonian , is indeed the proper description of the low  temperature phase of the system .",
    "the results mentioned above ( as well as others discussed below ) then follow in an almost straightforward manner from the charge description .",
    "the equivalence of the two approaches is based on a very important observation .",
    "the charge discreteness ( crucial in the low  temperature insulating phase ) manifests itself in the phase model through the @xmath20periodicity of the phase field ( the internal space of the field is the circle @xmath21 . )",
    "the latter results in the existence of topologically distinct stationary  point field configurations , classified by the integer winding numbers @xmath22 ( where the vector index @xmath23 numerates the grains on the lattice . ) in strongly connected arrays , @xmath1 , the action cost for configurations with non ",
    "zero winding numbers ( so  called korshunov instantons  @xcite ) is exponentially large .",
    "however , one has to take into account gaussian fluctuations around the topologically non  trivial stationary points , which yield a factor @xmath24 for each winding number mismatch between neighboring grains .",
    "this factor suggests that the instanton configurations are increasingly important at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "summation of the instanton `` gas '' along with the corresponding gaussian fluctuations and the phase  volume factors results exactly in the classical ( low  frequency ) limit of the @xmath25dimensional charge model .",
    "specifically ( see below ) , the instanton expansion of the phase model coincides term by term with the perturbative expansion in back  scattering amplitudes of the charge model .",
    "therefore , we are convinced that the explicit account for instantons in the phase  like models is imperative to restore the charge discreteness and , thus , to describe the insulating phase .",
    "one may justifiably worry about the role of non  gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the latter are known to become large at a low enough temperature @xmath26 , violating the validity of the instanton gas picture .",
    "crucially , however , ( in 1d and 2d ) the corresponding charge model predicts an activation gap which is _ parametrically larger _",
    "( exponential ( in @xmath0 ) in 1d and algebraic in 2d ) than @xmath27 . as a result",
    ", there is a wide range of temperatures , where the fluctuations are well under control , while the physics is completely dominated by the proliferation of instantons .",
    "the latter results in the appearance of the unit  charge extended solitons as low  energy charged excitations and , thus , in activation insulating behavior , eq .  ( [ eq - res ] ) . in 3d , proliferation of instantons and the onset of strong non ",
    "gaussian fluctuations , resp .",
    ", take place at comparable temperatures . as a result the phase ",
    "charge equivalence can not be reliably established .",
    "it seems plausible , however , that the instanton gas  and thus the corresponding charge representation  provide a qualitatively correct description of the 3d insulator as well .",
    "this paper is an extension of two previous shorter publications  [ ] .",
    "its intent is two  fold .",
    "firstly , we present some new results . in particular , we extend calculations beyond the tunneling limit , accounting for arbitrary transmission amplitudes between neighboring grains .",
    "furthermore , in addition to an evaluation of the transport properties , we discuss the behavior of the single  particle density of states ( dos ) .",
    "secondly , we bring out the philosophy of our approach and expose extensive technical details of the calculations .",
    "our main message is that charge quantization is crucial in describing the low  temperature physics of the array  and , therefore , a description in terms of charge degrees of freedom is appropriate .",
    "as mentioned above , this description is obtained by accounting for topologically non  trivial field configurations in the phase picture .",
    "this goes beyond the commonly used perturbative treatment of the phase model . in 1d and 2d arrays ,",
    "the latter completely misses the appearance of a new temperature scale @xmath28 marking the crossover to insulating behavior .",
