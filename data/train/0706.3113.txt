    "galaxy spectra contain a wealth of information on the present and past star formation of galaxies , in the form of stellar continuum shape , stellar and interstellar absorption , and nebular emission lines .",
    "in particular , the region around the 4000  break provides us with powerful diagnostics of the luminosity - weighted mean stellar age and the fraction of stars formed in recent ( @xmath41gyr ) bursts , from the height of the break and the relative strength of the hydrogen balmer absorption lines respectively .",
    "while considerable progress has been made in extracting the global star formation history ( sfh ) of galaxies from their present day integrated optical spectra @xcite , the potential for recovering detailed _ recent _ sfhs from spectra in these large datasets has remained relatively unexplored .",
    "determining the recent ( @xmath5gyr ) star formation history of galaxies has considerable importance for understanding the effects of external and internal physical processes on the evolution of galaxies , since this timescale corresponds to only a few galaxy dynamical times . as a result of such processes",
    ", galaxies are expected to undergo strong fluctuations in their star formation over short timescales , which may in turn be linked to other aspects of galaxy evolution , such as the build - up of stellar bulges .",
    "sharp transitions in the star formation rate of galaxies leave clear imprints on the integrated light of the stellar population , as the balance of light contributed by stars of different masses changes .",
    "spectroscopic research in this area has focussed in particular on so - called e+a ( or k+a ) galaxies  an early type galaxy spectrum and superposed a - type stellar spectrum , resulting in strong balmer absorption lines .",
    "an excess population of a stars results when the corresponding o and b star population , which dominates the light during ongoing star formation , has died out or is not visible .",
    "therefore , the relative fraction of a to o stars provides information on changes in the star formation rate of galaxies over the last @xmath11 - 2gyr .",
    "studied spectroscopically since the early 1980 s , these objects have been suggested to be caused by either a short burst of star formation in the last gyr @xcite , recent truncation of star formation caused by stripping of gas in cluster environments @xcite , or simply obscuration of younger , hotter stars by dust @xcite .",
    "all these scenarios may contribute to the e+a galaxy population ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is generally believed that the objects with very strong balmer absorption lines are incompatible with pure truncation of star formation and are likely to be true `` post - starburst '' objects @xcite .",
    "the e+a phenomena is also often observationally linked with the presence of an agn @xcite , with direct implications for the starburst - agn connection ; it is this question which we primarily aim to address in this paper .",
    "recent numerical simulations have suggested a scenario in which major mergers between galaxies provide the fuel and a disrupted gravitational potential conducive to both the build up of the galaxy bulge through star formation and the fuelling of the central black hole . @xcite and @xcite suggest that triggering by such major mergers can account for the properties of the entire qso population .",
    "direct observational confirmation of this scenario remains elusive however , and the causal connection between starburst and agn activity is still unconstrained .",
    "furthermore , alternative theories for the build up of black hole mass in a less spectacular fashion do exist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to be able to accurately describe the recent sfh of galaxies , in terms of the age and strength of recent starbursts , and to distinguish between truncation of star formation , starbursts or starbursts followed by truncation , will allow such theoretical scenarios to be thoroughly tested .",
    "our ability to measure recent fluctuations in the star formation rate of galaxies has in part been restricted by the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) required of spectra in order to measure the  balmer line with accuracy .",
    "the  line is important as the strongest balmer absorption line not to suffer irreparably from emission line infilling in all but the galaxies with the highest star formation rates .",
    "however , this traditional diagnostic is no longer adequate for our purposes , being unsuitable for detecting all but the strongest post - starburst galaxies in current high redshift spectroscopic surveys , or for detecting small and/or relatively old bursts without employing the stacking spectra to obtain mean results @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic dependence of the  line strength on luminosity weighted mean stellar age also causes populations defined through a simple cut on equivalent width ( ew ) to be biased towards the youngest or the very strongest post - starburst systems . for these reasons",
    "we develop in this paper a new set of spectral indicators specifically designed to quantify the recent star formation of galaxies .",
    "these new indicators are based on a principal component analysis ( pca ) of the spectral region 3750 - 4150  of a set of model galaxies created from the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bc03 ) galaxev spectral synthesis code , a proportion of which have undergone stochastic starbursts .",
    "pca is traditionally used to identify correlations and variance in datasets and has often been applied to galaxy spectra @xcite . by applying pca to spectral data , collections of correlated features , such as the balmer absorption lines , are easily extracted and quantified as a single parameter . allowing all balmer absorption lines to contribute to measuring the balmer absorption strength",
    "greatly improves over the snr obtained from measuring a single line alone .",
    "as we shall show , the first three principal components output from our analysis are easily interpreted as : 1 ) 4000  break strength ( correlated with balmer absorption line strength ) ; 2 ) _ excess _ balmer absorption ; 3 ) _ excess _ ( h&k ) absorption .",
    "previous work has made extensive use of d@xmath6(4000 ) and  line strength to recover underlying physical parameters of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) such as stellar mass and age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the first two principal components simply measure the two features already known to vary most in this spectral region .",
    "the third component , ( h&k ) strength , is used less often as a sfh indicator .",
    "however , it has been identified previously as a powerful diagnostic of a to f star fractions in galaxies @xcite and for breaking the degeneracy between age and strength of a recent starburst @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the method and the qualitative trends of agn properties with recent star formation history of their host bulges . in future papers",
    "we will use the new method to derive quantitative parameters such as starburst strengths and ages .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "sdss ] we introduce the sdss galaxy sample to which we will be applying our new method .",
    "readers with no further interest in the method may skip to section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec : method ] the new method is presented in detail , including details of the input models , the pca method and the physical interpretation of the resulting eigenspectra .",
    "the new indices are applied to the sdss dataset in section [ sec : real ] and related to traditional indices to allow an easy reference point for interpretation .",
    "duplicate observations of sdss galaxies are used to show the improvement of our new indices over the old ones . in section [ sec : models ] we compare bc03 stellar population model tracks to our sample of sdss galaxies and provide a simple toy model with which to visualise the evolution of the galaxies in the principal component planes . in section [ sec : bias ]",
    "the bc03 models are used to investigate potential biases and degeneracies involved in the interpretation of the new indices . in section [ sec : results ] we investigate trends of recent star formation history in the bulges of high surface mass density galaxies with global galaxy morphology , dust content and agn strength .",
    "the contribution of agn hosted by each class of bulge to the overall present day black hole accretion rate is presented .",
    "our results are discussed in section [ sec : disc ] .    where necessary we assume the standard cosmology with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "_ vacuum wavelengths are quoted throughout_.",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectroscopic galaxy catalogue , with more than 500000 spectra in its fourth data release ( dr4 , * ? ? ? * ) , provides the ideal database for a first application and full testing of any new spectral analysis method .",
    "we concentrate on the bulges of low redshift galaxies . with 3  diameter fibres , the sdss spectra probe only the central few kpc of low redshift galaxies : 0.6 - 4kpc diameters for @xmath0 .",
    "we use this `` fibre aperture effect '' to our advantage to allow us to study the recent star formation history of galaxy bulges close to the central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) that is present in many of these systems .",
    "our sample is selected to be spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 .",
    "the upper redshift limit of 0.07 fits well with the characteristic radius of bulge  dominated galaxies in the sdss of @xmath14.4kpc @xcite .",
    "we further restrict the galaxies to have stellar surface mass densities ( @xmath10 ) greater than @xmath11m@xmath12kpc@xmath13 , where m@xmath14 is stellar mass measured by @xcite and r@xmath15 is @xmath16-band half - light petrosian radius .",
    "below this surface density , the disk dominates the light and the measured velocity dispersion within the fibre aperture does not relate to the central velocity dispersion of the stars around the black hole and thus can not be used to determine black hole mass @xcite .",
    "we expect this cut to have minimal impact on our final analysis of total  luminosities of agn hosted by each type of stellar population , as low surface density systems contribute very little to the volume - averaged integrals of black hole mass and accretion rates @xcite . a lower limit on velocity dispersion is set at 70 , because the spectral resolution of the sdss means that reliable velocity dispersions can not be obtained for lower values .",
    "70  corresponds to a black hole mass of @xmath17m@xmath12 using the observed correlation between bulge velocity dispersion and black hole mass of @xcite .",
    "to summarise , our sample contains sdss dr4 main sample galaxies that match the following criteria :    * spectroscopically classified as a galaxy * with matches in the photometric catalogue * zwarning flag @xmath18 * redshift @xmath0 * stellar surface density @xmath19m@xmath12kpc@xmath13 ( m@xmath20 from * ? ? ?",

    "are removed from the sample leaving 33514 galaxies .",
    "photometric properties used in this paper are taken directly from the sdss catalogue ; spectroscopic continuum parameters used , such as  and d@xmath6(4000 ) , are available through the sdss - mpa value added catalogue webpages and described in @xcite .    because we are interested in the average properties of different types of galaxies within our sample , it is important to allow for the fact that the sample is magnitude- and not volume - limited .",
    "we do this by weighting each galaxy contributing to a mean or total quantity by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the maximum volume in which the galaxy may be observed in the spectroscopic survey @xcite .",
    "we use the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bpt ) method to discriminate between narrow emission lines that are primarily caused by ongoing star formation or a central agn , using the flux ratios /  and /.",
    "the sample is divided into four primary subsamples : ` pure agn ' ( 3165 ) , agn including composite objects ( agn+composite , 11751 ) , star forming ( sf , 6357 ) and unclassified objects ( unclass , 15406 ) .",
    "the emission line ratios of pure - agn place them above the stringent theoretical criterion of @xcite : @xmath27/{\\rm h}\\beta ) > 0.61/{\\log([{\\rm n\\,ii}]/{\\rm",

    "the ` agn+composite ' sample has emission lines that lie above the observationally determined demarcation line of @xcite : @xmath27/{\\rm h}\\beta ) > 0.61/{\\log([{\\rm n\\,ii}]/{\\rm",
    "h}\\alpha ) - 0.05}+1.3\\ ] ] or have /  flux ratio greater than @xmath29 .",
    "non - agn have lines that are dominated by star formation .",
    "the remainder are ` unclassified ' , primarily because of non - existent or very weak emission lines .",
    "the emission line measurements are provided on the sdss - mpa webpages and details are given in @xcite ; errors have been rescaled according to the information provided on the website . briefly",
    ", spectral synthesis models are used to fit the stellar continuum , including absorption features , and emission lines are measured from the residual of the data and model fit , thus contamination of the nebular emission lines by stellar absorption is accounted for .",
    "dust attenuation of the emission lines is corrected for when  and  are measured with snr of @xmath22 and the flux in the  line is greater than @xmath30 , using the balmer decrement method .",
    "the latter cut on  flux was placed after investigation of objects with very high balmer decrements , which were often found to have apparently underestimated errors on .",
    "we assume an intrinsic case b ratio of 2.87 @xcite .",
    "we note that a slightly higher ratio of @xmath31 is generally accepted to apply in agn , and this will cause a small systematic overestimate of our dust attenuations where emission lines are dominated by agn ( of @xmath32 at ) .",
    "however , separating the relative contributions of star formation and agn to the lines is a difficult topic and we use a single ratio for simplicity .",
    "the form of the dust attenuation in star forming regions ( birth clouds ) and narrow line regions around agn is not well known , but has a significant impact on our results .",
    "we therefore choose to present our results using two different attenuation corrections .",
    "the first is a single power - law of the form @xmath33 which provides a good fit to the uv to ir continua of starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the attenuation caused by the birth clouds from which the emission lines originate will be more screen like ( less grey ) in form and this is not accounted for in the simple single - power law prescription .",
    "this results in dust - corrected  emission line luminosities in average starforming galaxies that are a factor of several higher than those derived using a standard milky - way like absorption curve .",
    "we therefore introduce a second prescription , designed _ specifically for the purposes of correcting emission lines _ :",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total effective optical depth in the @xmath36-band and @xmath37 is the fraction of total @xmath35 caused by the ambient ism .",
    "we set @xmath38 based on observed relations between uv continuum slope and  to  emission line ratios . although the exponent in the first term is not well constrained by observations of external galaxies , @xmath39 lies between that observed in line - of - sight observations to stars in the milky way , lmc and smc @xcite .",
    "this new dust prescription thus accounts for the attenuation of the emission lines within the birth clouds ( first term ) and the attenuation as the light passes though the ism [ second term , see da cunha et al .",
    "( in preparation ) for further details ] .    due primarily to insufficient snr of the weaker  emission line , it is only possible to correct 26% of our galaxies for dust attenuation of the emission lines .",
    "the majority of the objects without dust attenuation corrections are quiescent systems with little ongoing star formation and thus very weak emission lines ; this accounts for 73% of the galaxies we are unable to calculate corrections for , using the classification of section [ sec : class ] .",
    "these old stellar populations are known to contain very low quantities of dust : we find they have mean @xmath16-band attenuations consistent with zero ( derived from model fits to the stellar continuum by @xcite ) . as the star formation rate of systems increases ,",
    "the percentage that we can correct for dust attenuation rises , as does their mean dust content . for the galaxy - bulges with normal levels of ongoing star formation ( mean log specific star formation within the fibre of -10.26 , see section [ sec : class ] ) , 68% are corrected for dust attenuation and for the starbursting galaxies 98% are corrected .",
    "we therefore believe that the primary results of this paper are not biased by the objects for which dust attenuation correction of the emission lines is not possible .",
    "however , as will be discussed later , there is a population of objects for which it is likely that we are unable to measure  in a large fraction due to extreme dust attenuation .",
    "while this bias has been included in our discussions where appropriate , we note that these systems account for only @xmath11.5% of those for which a balmer decrement is not obtained .",
    "our galaxy sample has been specifically selected to omit broad line ( type 1 ) agn .",
    "this is achieved by an automated spectroscopic classification algorithm within the standard sdss pipeline . uncovering the true stellar populations of broad line agn",
    "is a substantial topic in its own right , due to the contamination of the stellar light by continuum light from the agn .",
    "we have made no attempt in this paper to study broad line agn , and refer the interested reader to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for studies of their stellar populations and contribution to the  luminosity density in the sdss .",
    "within the unified model of agn , type 1 ( broad line , unobscured ) and type 2 ( narrow line , obscured ) agn are expected to differ only in the sightline by which they are viewed . in this scenario",
    "the stellar populations of type 2 agn are expected to be representative of those of type 1 agn with the same  luminosities .",
    "this was the conclusion arrived at by @xcite and , while the precise balance of stellar population classes as derived in this paper of type 1 agn relative to type 2 agn is obviously of great interest , it is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "( 4000 ) is calculated as defined by @xcite ; hashed areas indicate regions from which the  index is calculated @xcite .",
    "the stars are ordered by temperature , from hot to cold ( i.e. shortest to longest main sequence lifetime ) .",
    "the 4000  break strength increases monotonically with decreasing temperature , while  equivalent width decreases for the cooler stars , thus both provide powerful age indicators for young to intermediate age stellar populations .",
    "this paper works with the wavelength region 3750 - 4150 . ]",
    "our primary goal is to improve upon the traditional method of identifying post - starburst galaxies through the strength of absorption and  emission .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the balmer line region of the galaxy continuum , which , in the optical , contains the greatest amount of information on the relative fractions of o to a stars . by selecting a small wavelength region",
    ", we also minimise the effects of internal dust attenuation in the galaxies , and can easily uncover and isolate discrepancies between models and data .    in figure",
    "[ fig : stars ] a selection of stellar spectra are plotted in the wavelength range 3750 - 4200 .",
    "the defining wavelength regions of two indices traditionally applied in this region are indicated and prominent absorption lines marked . with decreasing stellar temperature the 4000  break strength [ as measured by d@xmath6(4000 ) ] increases and",
    "the @xmath404102.9 absorption line first strengthens and then weakens .",
    "a strong uv continuum is evident in the hottest stars .",
    "each stellar type has a characteristic main sequence lifetime , @xmath10.5gyr and 3gyr for a and f stars respectively ; it is these different lifetimes that allow us to study the star formation histories of stellar populations .",
    "( h&k ) strength increases rapidly through a stars to f stars , the ratio of ( h)+  to ( k ) thus provides the decisive fine age indicator for young ( @xmath41gyr ) stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the main principle behind our method is to use all the spectral features in the wavelength region around the 4000  break , to quantify the young stellar content of the galaxy based on continuum shape and absorption line strengths .",
    "we achieve this by searching for patterns of pixels which vary most within a set of model spectra and , from these patterns , defining three new spectral indices . from previous work on galaxy spectra",
    "we expect the main variation in this wavelength range to be the strength of the 4000  break which is well known to be a powerful stellar age indicator .",
    "the second variation is expected to be related to  absorption strength , which gives an additional constraint on the relative amount of any additional young stellar component .",
    "although our original aim was simply to create a high snr replacement for , our procedure also identified  as a clearly interpretable third axis of variation .",
    "the method is based on a principal component analysis ( pca ) , a standard multivariate analysis technique used in many quantitative science fields , and a mathematical introduction is included in appendix [ ap_pca ] .",
    "it is however important for the reader to have a basic visualisation of the process . a spectrum that contains @xmath41 pixels of flux values is normally thought of in terms of a 1-dimensional array",
    "; it can alternatively be imagined as a _",
    "single point _ in an @xmath41 dimensional space .",
    "a collection of spectra then becomes a cloud of points in this space , rather than a 2d array of flux values .",
    "pca searches for the lines of greatest variance in the cloud of points representing the spectra , with each line described by a vector that is called a `` principal component '' or `` eigenspectrum '' .",
    "the principal components are constrained to be orthogonal to one another and placed in order of the amount of variance within the dataset that they account for .",
    "the principal components form a new basis , rotated from the original , upon which the galaxy spectra are projected to obtain the amplitude of the principal components contained within each .",
    "there are several options for creating an input dataset for spectral pca analyses .",
    "arguably one of the more favourable is to use the data themselves , thus avoiding any bias in the final results caused by the limited physics contained within models .",
    "however , while one of the oft quoted ` benefits ' of pca is its ability to identify correlations and variations in datasets without the need for calibration with models and theory , any interpretation of observational results ultimately depends upon some link between theory and data .",
    "although spectral synthesis models contain some limitations that must be kept in mind by observers and modellers alike , they currently provide the framework upon which much of our understanding of galaxy evolution is based .",
    "we must therefore choose at what stage the models and data are to be compared .",
    "for our specific purpose of deriving new high snr indices to describe the stellar continuum and absorption lines of galaxies , there are several disadvantages to preforming the pca on real galaxy spectra .",
    "first and foremost is the contamination of the data by emission line infilling of the balmer series .",
    "as nebular emission varies greatly between galaxies , any pca on a representative population of galaxy spectra primarily describes the emission line strength @xcite , which quantifies current star formation rate and/or agn strength alone .",
    "due to potential agn contamination , we are particularly interested in deriving star formation indices that are independant of emission lines and it was found not to be possible to satisfactorily remove or mask the balmer emission lines that occur in the center of the absorption features in which we are interested .",
    "secondly , we intend our new method to be applicable to many datasets , allowing a direct comparison between datasets just as with traditional indices .",
    "were the pca to be performed on each dataset individually , different principal components would be found and a comparison between the datasets becomes non - trivial .    a second option , and the one chosen in this paper , is to introduce the spectral synthesis models from the start by creating a model galaxy population .",
    "the set of models , based on the bc03 stellar population synthesis code , is similar to that used in @xcite and @xcite , although with more restricted parameter ranges .",
    "6629 stellar populations are created obeying the following criteria :    * time of galaxy formation is distributed uniformly between 0 and 5.7gyr after the big bang , where the age of the universe is assumed to be 13.7gyr .",
    "* the underlying star formation rate is characterised by an exponential decay rate distributed uniformly between @xmath42 * metallicity is distributed linearly in solar units between @xmath43    no metallicity evolution is included in the model galaxies .",
    "top hat bursts are then superposed `` stochastically '' on these underlying sfhs with equal probability at all times .",
    "these are parameterised in terms of @xmath44 , the fraction of stellar mass formed in bursts in the past 2gyr to that formed by the underlying sfh during the total evolution of the galaxy , and the length of the burst .",
    "@xmath44 is distributed logarithmically between 0.0 and 0.1 and the length of the burst is distributed uniformly between 0.03 and 0.3gyr .",
    "finally , the fraction of galaxies with _ ongoing _ starbursts is reduced to 25% of those initially created leaving 6473 model galaxies , 29% of which have experienced a burst in the past 2gyr .",
    "the number of galaxies with ongoing starbursts was reduced because the starburst features were found to overly dominate the principal components for our requirements .",
    "it is important to be clear about the effect of the input sample on any pca .",
    "pca is a non - robust variance based technique : changing the distribution of input galaxies greatly affects the output principal components .",
    "additionally , pca is affected by outliers in the dataset , and if principal components representative of the majority of the dataset are required then such outliers must be removed .",
    "although we set out to recreate a population of early - type galaxies with varying degrees of recent `` bursty '' sfhs , the details of the input sample were selected through trial and error , with the aim of recovering principal components with good power to distinguish the age and strength of recent bursts .",
    "once the components are created , the precise details of the input set become irrelavant , simply affecting the ability of the new indices to measure the physical parameters we are interested in .",
    "we note that a more elegant way to achieve similar results may be through application of a method similar to the moped algorithm of @xcite , to tailor the principal components from the outset to the parameters we wish to extract from the data .",
    "this algorithm has already been used to derive global star formation histories and metallicities from sdss galaxy spectra @xcite . at this stage",
    "however we prefer the more transparent approach of pca , through which it is relativley straightforward to understand our results and isolate imperfections in the theoretical models .",
    "a pca on the sdss data was also performed and , with suitable masking of emission lines , found to produce qualitatively similar first and second principal components .      in this and",
    "the following sections we explicitly refer to the sdss dataset which is studied in this paper ( section [ sec : sdss ] ) , however the procedure may be adapted to any other dataset .",
    "the 3750 - 4150  wavelength range is extracted from the bc03 model galaxy spectra , the spectra are shifted to vacuum wavelengths , rebinned to match the logarithmic sdss wavelength binning , and convolved to have velocity dispersions equal to 150 , the mean value of the dataset to which the new indices will be applied in this paper .",
    "the effect of velocity dispersion on the derived components will be discussed further in section [ sec : bias ] , at this stage it suffices to note that the balmer series lines in which we are particularly interested are strongly pressure broadened in main sequence dwarf stars , and thus in young and intermediate age stellar populations these particular line widths are relatively unaffected by the velocity dispersion of the galaxy .",
    "each model spectrum is normalised to have total flux of unity , the mean spectrum of the input dataset is calculated and subtracted , and the pca is run to produce the principal components , termed eigenspectra from now on , which are to define our new spectral indices .",
    "figure [ fig : espec ] presents the mean spectrum and first four eigenspectra of our input model galaxies .",
    "the mean spectrum is typical for that of an quiescent galaxy ( see figure [ fig : comps ] ) ; the first component shows the 4000  break and corresponding inverse - correlation with balmer line strength ; the second component shows the balmer series and inverse - correlation with the blue continuum shape seen in o and b type stars ; the third component is primarily dominated by the ( h&k ) absorption lines , with ( h ) decorrelated from the broader h@xmath45 at the same wavelength ; the fourth component contains further metallicity information , however , by this stage it becomes more difficult to find simple interpretations for the eigenspectra .",

    "the resulting principal component amplitudes represent the amount of each eigenspectrum present in the galaxy spectrum ; these are our new indices .",
    "often there are regions of a real spectrum which we do not wish to include in the analysis , for example , regions with bad sky line subtraction or regions affected by nebular emission lines .",
    "we mask these pixels with a process called gappy - pca , introduced to spectral analysis in astronomy by @xcite .",
    "this allows pixels to contribute zero weight during the calculation of the principal component amplitudes , although at the price that the independence of the individual components is degraded . in the sdss dataset",
    "bad pixels are identified as those with error set to zero .",
    "additionally we mask 5  either side of the ne  iii@xmath46 line in spectra in which this line is detected at greater than @xmath47 , and the centers of the  through h@xmath48 lines in spectra with equivalent width of  in emission measured to be greater than 1  by @xcite .",
    "the effect of emission line infilling is discussed further in section [ sec : emfilling ] . because the balmer emission lines sit at the center of absorption lines , the resulting flux normalisation is systematically biased by the masking procedure .",
    "a new gappy - pca algorithm has been developed by one of us ( gl ) which allows the flux normalisation as an additional free parameter during the calculation of the principal components .",

    "looking at the starburst tracks in pc1/2 , we can see the familiar degeneracy between the age and the strength of the burst .",
    "the `` post - starburst '' objects in the ` hump ' could be galaxies that have undergone a massive starburst a relatively long time ago , or a smaller starburst more recently .",
    "this degeneracy is also present in d@xmath6(4000 ) vs. .",
    "pc3 allows the degeneracy to be broken however , by making use of the rapidly changing  line strength between a and f stars .    as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , it remains unclear as to whether galaxies with strong balmer absorption lines have indeed experienced a recent burst of star formation in the past ( post - starburst ) , or whether the star formation has simply been shut - off ( truncation ) , for example by interaction between the intracluster medium and the galaxy s interstellar medium as it enters a cluster environment or by feedback associated with the rapid growth of a black hole .",
    "for a single galaxy , distinguishing these scenarios from our stellar continuum measures alone is difficult ; shutting off the star formation in the continous star formation histories , causes galaxies to move upwards in pc2 .",
    "however , taking the population of galaxy - bulges as a whole provides additional constraints .",
    "in particular , the truncation model does not explain the relatively large number of bulges that are undergoing starbursts , while these are the natural progenitors of the post starbursts in our sample .",

    "the same low stellar mass quiescent population has been used for both , and convolved up to the higher velocity dispersion for the dotted tracks .",
    "a small effect is seen on all components .",
    "we note that there is an offset between the exponential star formation history bc03 model galaxies and the sdss data in  vs. , where none was previously apparent ( see figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "this mismatch results from spectrophotometric calibration differences between the sdss dataset and stars in the stelib stellar spectral library , which underpins the bc03 models .",
    "the difference between earlier work and the current analysis is primarily in the spectrophotometric calibration of the sdss spectra between dr1 and dr2 ( abazajian et  al . , 2004 ) .",

    "the effect on the principal component amplitudes of a mismatch in 4000  break strength between models and data is not immediately intuitive .",
    "pc2 is in fact worst affected ,",
    "because the primary variance in the data is the shape of the continuum and it is this that pca concentrates on fitting first .",
    "because of the anti - correlation between 4000  break and balmer line strength , the best fitting first component then has too strong balmer lines and pc2 must be used to counterbalance some of this .",
    "an additional effect , visible in the reconstructions of some starforming spectra , is a subsequent mismatch in the far blue continuum shape .",
    "an offset in pc3 is expected , due to the incorrect amount of  being introduced by the other two components .",
    "we expect the current problem with the spectral synthesis models to be solved in the very near future , however , it is clear that systematic errors on derived parameters from spectral synthesis models may be significantly larger than the statistical errors usually quoted . in this paper",
    "we are uneffected by such problems , as we do not attempt to derive full quantitative solutions of burst parameters for our galaxies . in future papers",
    "it will be important to consider comparison between different spectral synthesis models , such as those based on synthetic stellar libraries @xcite .",
    "one of the most difficult parts of fitting models to the stellar component of a galaxy spectrum is the contamination of the data spectrum by non - stellar light .",
    "nebular emission lines are one such contaminant that we must be particularly cautious of , as they affect the balmer absorption lines in which we are particularly interested .",
    "we selected a subsample of objects with  emission and compared the three principal component amplitudes obtained with and without masking the centers of the  through h@xmath48 absorption lines .",
    "a clear emission line equivalent width limit was found below which the amplitudes remained unbiased . above this limit ( given in section [ sec : real ] )",
    "we mask the centers of the absorption lines before calculating the amplitudes . additionally , the flux normalisation of the spectra is crucial , as the emission lines sit preferentially in the centers of absorption lines , it is thus preferable to leave normalisation as a free parameter when calculating the component amplitudes ( section [ sec : real ] )",
    ".    we note that for strongly star - forming systems , the second principal component primarily fits the overall shape of the continuum i.e. the strong blue emission from the hot stars , rather than the strength of the balmer absorption features .",
    "there is a population of objects which scatter below the star - forming branch of the pc1/2 plane , with weak balmer absorption lines for their 4000  break strength .",
    "further investigation of these spectra show them to be objects with apparently old stellar populations , but some excess blue continua . a proportion of these are weak type 1 agn in which some broad line component is visible in the stronger balmer emission lines .",
    "many others are found to have radio ( first ) and/or soft x - ray ( rass ) counterparts , and are most likely weak bl lacs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to the pca analysis the featureless blue agn continuum looks very similar to the blue continuum of young o and b stars , weakening the balmer series and 4000  break in a similar way ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a stellar population study of these objects from their optical spectra alone is beyond the scope of this initial paper , and we simply treat them as a separate class of objects .",

    "+ @xmath51 using a double power - law dust attenuation correction to account for differing attenuations in the birth clouds and ism ( equation [ eq : dust ] ) .",
    "we now look more quantitatively at the total  luminosity contributed by agn in bulges with different recent star formation histories , splitting the bulge sample into the stellar population subclasses defined in section [ sec : results ] .    in the top panels of figure [ fig : oiii ] the total  luminosity of agn contained in each class of galaxy bulge",
    "is plotted , before and after correcting the  flux for dust attenuation ; the results are also given in table [ tab : oiii ] .",
    "all results are shown for the two dust laws given in section [ sec : dust_correct ] and in the following text results are given first for the single power - law dust attenuation correction , and in brackets for the double power - law correction .",
    "we note that although the general trends in our results are not changed by which dust law we use , the absolute values of the mean luminosities are considerably different .",
    "objects without the requisite lines with which to calculate the dust attenuation are included in the integral without any dust correction ; this will cause a small underestimation of the total dust corrected  luminosity in most classes as discussed in section [ sec : dust_correct ] ( the fraction of objects with dust corrections are given in table [ tab : oiii ] ) .",
    "there are two main results .",
    "firstly we can see that all classes of galaxy bulges are important contributers to the volume - integrated agn  luminosity of our sample , although clearly the ordinary star - forming class dominates the budget . secondly , due to the trend of increasing dust content with increasing star formation _ our perception of the relative importance of agn hosted by each class of bulge is greatly affected by the inclusion of the dust correction_.    in particular the agn hosted in post - starburst bulges are most affected by the dust correction , changing their position in the volume - integrated  budget from relatively unimportant to contributing at a similar level to the other minority classes , despite their small numbers .",
    "careful investigation of the spectral fits shows that this is not caused by a systematic problem with our emission line measures in objects with strong balmer absorption , however we find that more than 30% ( almost 20% for the double power - law dust correction ) of the final dust corrected  luminosity contributed by agn in post - starburst bulges arises from 13 objects with observed  to  flux ratio greater than @xmath18.6 , corresponding to an optical depth in the v - band ( @xmath35 ) of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 for the double power - law dust correction ) . at these attenuations small errors on the balmer decrements",
    "can lead to significant absolute errors on the total luminosities , and the form of the dust law used becomes crucial .",
    "additionally , more than 50% of the post - starburst bulges are not corrected for dust attenuation before being included in the calculation of total  luminosity , primarily due to insufficient snr or flux in the  emission line to accurately determine their balmer decrements .",
    "it is entirely plausible that these would also contribute significantly were we able to measure their dust contents .",
    "ideally , follow - up ir observation is required to identify the true dust contents of these objects , and therefore their true contribution to the global volume - integrated  luminosity of type 2 agn ( see section [ sec : psb ] ) .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ fig : oiii ] show the mean  luminosity arising from agn in each class of bulge .",
    "again , the huge difference in the post - starburst systems before and after dust correction is notable .",
    "it is also notable that _ agn contained within the starburst and post - starburst bulges have the highest mean _  _ luminosity , after dust correction , of the entire sample_. it is important to note that the mean luminosity of the post - starbursts should be taken as lower limits , due to those objects we are unable to correct for dust attenuation , and the mean luminosity of the starbursts should be taken as upper limits , due to contamination by star formation .",
    "the distribution of stellar populations of galaxy bulges in the 2-dimensional space of 4000  break strength and balmer absorption line strength is qualitatively well described by a burst scenario , with a mixture of brief , strong bursts and longer lived or more frequent weak bursts causing about half of the bulges to show signs of ongoing or recent star formation . in the future ,",
    "a full comparison with model galaxy populations will allow us to understand more fully the physical processes and timescales involved .",
    "here we have concentrated on the morphological , dust and agn properties of galaxies in different regions of 4000  break strength and balmer absorption line strength space . in this section",
    "we will firstly review and collate the main observational findings presented in the preceeding sections , focussing on those galaxy bulges with ongoing or recent star formation .",
    "we will then summarise and discuss the main conclusions with respect to the build up of black hole mass in the local universe and the nature of the post - starburst bulges .",
    "finally , we will briefly discuss the possibility of breaking the well known burst age - burst strength degeneracy .",
    "figure [ fig : disc ] summarises the properties of our sample and our results , comparing the distributions of physical properties of galaxies with star - forming , starbursting and post - starburst stellar populations in their bulges .    * the classical indices  and :* the post - starburst class has a similar  distribution to the star - forming class , and therefore would be judged to have similar mean stellar ages using alone .",
    "our classification of objects as `` post - starburst '' is very different to previous studies , as can be seen from the distribution of  ( only objects with  measured with snr@xmath23 are included ) . instead of applying a straight cut on balmer line equivalent width ,",
    "we identify them as having excess balmer absorption for a given , allowing us to identify weaker and older bursts .",
    "luminosity and specific sfr : * the sequence in  is simply a sequence in specific sfr of the galaxy .",
    "those post - starburst galaxies with measured  emission lines have specific star formation rates covering the range of the starforming class .",
    "however , only @xmath140% of the total post - starburst sample are shown in this figure : a large fraction of the remainder can not be corrected for dust attenuation due to very weak  lines .    * stellar mass and stellar surface mass density : * the post - starburst and starforming classes are hosted by galaxies with similar stellar mass distributions , with the starburst class having a slightly lower mean stellar mass enclosed within the fibre .",
    "our sample was defined to have @xmath19m@xmath12kpc@xmath13 , and we can see a tail to higher stellar surface mass densities for post - starburst hosts , implying smaller @xmath16-band radii . this may be an indication of recent major mergers in a proportion of this class : simulations of dissipational ( gas - rich ) mergers suggest that remnants are more compact than the originating galaxies .",
    "* concentration and lopsidedness : * are both global properties measured from sdss photometry .",
    "the starforming and starburst bulges live in galaxies with a similar distribution of mean concentration , although figure [ fig : lops ] does show a trend of decreasing concentration with decreasing pc1 within the starforming class alone .",
    "the `` lopsidedness '' of the light distribution is an important indication of recent gravitational disturbance .",
    "although all the distributions are broad , both the starbursts and post - starbursts show a higher mean lopsidedness in their light distributions .",
    "such effects are expected to be identifiable in merger remnants for of - order a gigayear , in line with the likely ages of our post - starburst stellar populations .",
    "* attenuation by dust of stellar continuum light and nebular emission lines : * it is already well known that both measures of dust content in sdss galaxies are well correlated , although with large scatter , and there is a strong correlation between dust content and star formation rate .",
    "we find strong trends in attenuation of continuum light with stellar population , best viewed in the 2d histogram of figure [ fig : dust]@xmath50 .",
    "the post - starburst galaxy bulges have a much broader distribution of dust contents than the star - forming and star - bursting classes , in particular , a large fraction show very large balmer decrements which impacts greatly on their inferred star formation rates and agn accretion rates .",
    "*  emission luminosity : * while the majority of type 2 agn reside in quiescent galaxies , these are in general the least luminous , with low accretion rates . those with high accretion rates are hosted by galaxies with younger stellar populations . after correcting for attenuation by dust , we find that agn hosted by the post - starburst and starburst bulges have the highest mean  luminosities and , despite their smaller numbers ( 3.5% of the entire agn sample ) , contribute significantly to the total volume - integrated agn luminosity of the local universe ( @xmath11020% depending on the dust correction used ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the strongest accreting black holes are hosted by bulges with all types of recent star formation activity , not just those which lie on the evolution tracks of strong starbursts .",
    "clearly , an outstanding question in astrophysics today is the physical mechanisms responsible for the m-@xmath65 relation for black holes and bulges .",
    "our main conclusions relating to the recent star formation histories of galaxy bulges and the properties of the black holes they contain are as follows :    * due to the trend of increasing dust content with increasing star formation rate , the effect of dust attenuation of the  line impacts significantly on our estimation of which galaxies host the most rapidly growing black holes .",
    "* agn reside in galaxy bulges which have experienced a wide variety of recent star formation histories .",
    "the quiescent host bulges are the most numerous , containing 45% of all agn",
    ". however , these are agn with the lowest mean  luminosities .",
    "the bulges lying on the strong starburst track ( starbursts through post - starbursts , burst mass fractions @xmath661% ) are the least numerous , but have highest mean dust corrected agn luminosities ( fig [ fig : oiii ] ) . * putting these results together , and integrating the rate of black hole growth over our sample , we find that most ( @xmath180% ) of this growth is occurring in bulges with substantial recent or on - going star formation .",
    "however , the majority of this growth occurs in the star - forming class , which show no evidence for recent major changes in their star formation rate . *",
    "at least half of the total volume - integrated agn  luminosity is contributed by 207 bulges ( 0.5% of our total bulge sample ) .",
    "these are found in bulges that lie in the ordinary star - forming region , as well as along the strong starburst track .",
    "they account for 7% of the star - forming bulges , 15% of the post - starburst bulges and 29% of the starbursts . *",
    "we therefore conclude that a strong recent or ongoing central starburst ( possibly fuelled by a tidally - induced inflow of gas ) is a helpful , but not necessary condition for the build up of black holes in the present - day universe .",
    "the coincidence along the strong starburst track of enhanced disturbance of the global morphologies of the galaxies and increased black hole accretion rates , provides strong circumstantial evidence for a merger induced starburst , or post - starburst , agn connection",
    ". a full analysis will be the subject of the future paper .      in this paper",
    "we have developed a specific methodology for recognizing galaxies that are undergoing or have undergone an intense episode of star formation .",
    "our method differs from most of those used in the past . at the close of the paper , we will attempt to put our method and its results into the framework of these previous studies .",
    "some of these previous studies have emphasised the effect that heavy dust attenuation can have on the interpretation of the star formation history of bursty galaxies .",
    "we will examine this issue below .",
    "finally , we will briefly comment on the possibility of breaking the degeneracy between the time since the starburst and its strength .      as with many aspects of astronomy , the different classifications of similar objects used by different authors",
    "can lead to confusion . here",
    "we summarise the different aspects of defining a post - starburst sample , with respect to the results presented in this paper .    all the extant methods for recognizing post - starbursts make use of the unique signature provided by the stellar balmer absorption lines .",
    "the strength of these lines is not a monotonic function of time following a burst of star formation : rather , these lines are strongest in a - type stars which have main sequence lifetimes of @xmath10.1 to 1.0 gigayears . traditionally , this `` chronometer '' has been combined with a measure of the strength of the nebular emission - lines ( typically or ) .",
    "these are excited by o stars , which have a lifetime of only about seven million years .",
    "thus , the traditional definition of a post - starburst ( strong balmer absorption - lines and weak nebular emission - lines ) is quite sensitive to even relatively young post - starbursts .",
    "our classification scheme deliberately selects objects in a different way .",
    "first and foremost , we place no restriction on emission - line strengths , as this would remove all but the weakest emission - line agn from our sample @xcite .",
    "this has paid big dividends .",
    "we have shown that at least 56% of our post - starburst galaxies host agn , and that these are ( on - average ) the most luminous agn in our sample .",
    "preferentially selecting against those galaxies with strong agn will lead to a much reduced sample and potentially different conclusions .",
    "selection based on weak emission lines also prevents the possibility of selecting objects undergoing multiple , relatively closely spaced starbursts .",
    "for example , @xcite found that low mass galaxies classified as post - starbursts based on d4000 vs.  had _ stronger _ emission - lines ( indicating higher current star - formation rates ) .",
    "thus , whole sub - classes of objects undergoing similar processes may be missed by a cut based on weak emission - lines .",
    "it is also important to point out that we do not select strictly on the basis of the balmer absorption - lines .",
    "instead we require that post - starbursts have _ stronger balmer lines than expected based on their 4000  break strength . _",
    "this latter monotonically and slowly increases with time after a burst .",
    "this allows us to retain agn and to select much older post - starbursts , up until the point at which they return to the green - valley / quiescent population at an age of @xmath11 - 2gyr .",
    "in fact , figure [ fig : disc]@xmath51 shows that the post - starburst class exhibits a broad range in .",
    "this figure also clearly shows that the starburst class has a similar ( though narrower ) distribution in  as the post - starbursts .",
    "the difference in our selection method lies in the fact that a straight cut on balmer absorption - line strength preferentially selects young starbursts , while our method is still quite sensitive to older systems .",
    "this can be seen clearly in figure [ fig : diag ] , where a straight cut on  leads to a very different coverage of the burst tracks than our method .",
    "the disadvantage of our scheme of not selecting on emission lines is that it is relatively insensitive to _ young _ post - starbursts .",
    "these lie in the same region of pc1 _ vs. _ pc2 and  _ vs _  as young star - forming galaxies .",
    "thus , it is important to recognise that some of the bulges that we classify as starbursts may actually be young post - starbursts .",
    "an intriguing property of our sample of post - starburst galaxies is their high average balmer decrements , indicating very high dust contents ( see figure [ fig : dust ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : images6 ] presents images of some of the dustiest post - starburst galaxies ; a comparison with figure [ fig : images5 ] gives the impression that they are certainly redder , some with clear dust lanes .",
    "the apparently large amount of dust attenuation makes it difficult to obtain a clear and accurate picture of their true nature using optical data alone , especially given the large uncertainty in the slope of the dust attenuation curve at high optical depths .",
    "strong balmer absorption lines imply an excess of a stars visible relative to the slightly younger and hotter o and b stars",
    ". it does not necessarily imply no o or b stars are present , for example heavily dust enshrouded starbursts have been suggested as an explanation for the strong high - order balmer absorption - lines seen in many galaxies that are luminous in the far - infrared @xcite .",
    "this explanation may at first glance appear to fit well with the high dust contents of our objects .     and counterparts in the iras faint source catalogue .",
    "in regions of low number density , individual points are plotted . to guide the eye ,",
    "the same single weak instantaneous burst track is overplotted as in figure [ fig : number ] .",
    "the filled circles are vlirgs with @xmath67 , the red points would be classified as e(a ) galaxies by @xcite . ]    to test this possibility , we turn to a sample of sdss galaxies detected in the far - infrared ( fir ) with the iras satellite .",
    "note that in this sample , no restriction has been placed on stellar surface mass density of the galaxies , so these results pertain to the stellar populations of the bulges of all fir bright galaxies with optical counterparts in the sdss and in the redshift range @xmath0 .",
    "we use the same matched sample as described in @xcite , but for sdss dr4 , which includes 3008 main dr4 galaxies with @xmath0 , sdss spectral snr@xmath68 and detected 60@xmath37 m flux . a further 56 galaxies are removed during the pca , due to poor quality spectra , leaving a final sample of 2952 galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : iras ] presents the joint pc1/pc2 distribution of the galaxies ; overplotted is the same weak starburst track as in previous figures . according to our classification scheme , we find that the central regions of iras bright galaxies have predominantly starforming and starbursting stellar populations ( 82% ) .",
    "only 5% of them are found in the post - starburst class and only 9% have quiescent or green - valley populations .",
    "we focus in particular on the extreme ir bright objects in our sample , those classified as very luminous infrared galaxies ( vlirgs ) by and @xcite . converting their fir luminosity cut to our cosmology selects 21 objects with @xmath69 , where l@xmath70 is defined in ( * ? ? ?",

    "we have also used the iras faint source catalog to characterise the fir luminosities of our sample of post - starburst bulges . while we find that the fraction of post - starbursts with 60@xmath37 m iras detections increases with increasing balmer decrement ,",
    "the median value for the implied fir luminosity is only @xmath73 l@xmath12 , and only @xmath74 l@xmath12 for the @xmath110% of fir - detected post - starburst bulges with the steepest balmer decrements .",
    "this is significantly lower than the median value of @xmath75 for the vlirgs .",
    "we conclude that our dusty post - starbursts are significantly different from the vlirgs studied by @xcite .",
    "our objects have an older mean age ( less negative values of pc1 ) , a significantly greater excess in the strength of the balmer absorption - lines relative to typical galaxies of this age ( larger pc2 ) , and substantially lower fir luminosities ( lower implied star formation rates ) .",
    "we therefore believe that our objects are bona fide post - starbursts .",
    "the true cause of the high balmer decrements awaits follow - up infra - red observations , combined with detailed modelling of the dust distribution in galaxies , including in particular agb stars .",
    "the first step required to really constrain the causal connection between the central starbursts and the strong agn signatures is to break the degeneracy between the age of the last burst of star formation ( strictly the time since the starburst switched off ) and the mass of stars formed in the burst . in figure",
    "[ fig : diag ] we showed how this may be achieved using our third index , excess ( h&k ) absorption .",
    "these absorption lines have been introduced before by @xcite as a promising age diagnostic of bursts , however due to the snr required for their index , it is not applicable generally to sdss spectra .",
    "taking figure [ fig : diag ] at face value would suggest that there are a number of bulges with strong absorption which must be caused by very old , strong bursts .",
    "tracing the tracks back in pc1/2 would indicate that the progenitors of such systems are not contained within the sdss sample .    however , it is premature to draw such a conclusion for several reasons .",
    "firstly , as discussed in section [ sec : offset ] , the bc03 stellar population models show a systematic offset from the sdss data in 4000  break strength . as explained in section [ sec : offset ] the first pca component contains the primary correlation between 4000  break strength , balmer line strength and  absorption line strength ( see figure [ fig : espec ] : all three spectral features are visible in the first eigenspectrum ) . therefore , on fitting the correct 4000  break strength the first component reproduces the wrong absorption line strengths , forcing the second and third components to compensate .",
    "this could cause a systematic offset in pc3 and lead to the mistaken conclusion that the bursts are stronger than in reality .",
    "secondly , the instantaneous burst model is almost certainly a gross over simplification of the true recent star formation history of the bulges .",
    "we are now reaching the stage in galaxy spectral analysis where models with a physically motivated star formation history are required . by combining",
    "the next generation of accurate spectral synthesis models with numerical simulations of galaxy mergers , bar instabilities and the interaction of galaxies with the intercluster medium , and accurate number counts provided by simulations within a cosmological framework , the analysis of galaxy spectra to determine precise star formation histories will provide strong constraints on the physical processes driving the inflow of gas onto black holes , and the relative importance of star formation and black hole feedback in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the huge number of high quality galaxy spectra now available to us with surveys such as the sdss , allow unprecedented statistical studies of the properties of galaxies .",
    "until relatively recently , both samples and the spectral regions observed were small , making difficult analyses which are now routine , such as measurement of the balmer decrement to correct emission lines for dust attenuation . with such large quantities of high quality data , some form of data compression is necessary in order to cope .",
    "however , the simple extraction of small regions with which we are familiar - such as the lick indices - may be a poor way to make full use of all the information now available to us .",
    "now is the time in which statistical techniques applied to spectra , such as the one presented in this paper , can provide useful additional constraints on the physical processes underlying the galaxy spectra . of course",
    ", as more sensitive techniques are studied new problems will be found with the models , but these are rarely a cause for halting such studies .",
    "we have developed a new set of indices specifically designed for investigating the very recent star formation histories of galaxies , and applied them to the bulges of low redshift galaxies in the sdss .",
    "the indices are general , however , and may easily be applied to other datasets . in this paper",
    ", we have focussed on qualitative trends of global morphology , dust and agn properties with bulge stellar population in the low redshift universe , showing how new trends can be uncovered by simply using more sensitive techniques for measuring stellar populations from galaxy spectra . in the future",
    "we will be able to compare results such as these directly to theoretical models , using spectra calculated during detailed simulations of galaxy mergers and semi - analytic simulations of galaxy populations within the cosmological framework .",
    "such comparisons will allow us to investigate , for example , the relative importance of truncation of star formation and short starbursts in galaxies in clusters , of weak starbursts on the mass build up galaxy bulges , and of the quenching of star formation in bulges due to agn feedback , some of the key questions in galaxy evolution today .",
    "we would like to thank gustavo bruzual for providing invaluable help with the spectral synthesis models , and making available to us the latest versions , elisabete da cunha for providing useful insight into the dust corrections , brent groves and paul hewett for valuable discussions , and timothy beers for providing sdss stellar spectra to help with understanding the nature of the problem with the stellar libraries .",
