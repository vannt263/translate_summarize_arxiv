    "this is a classical problem which appears for instance in finance , where @xmath17 models the risk neutral stock price and @xmath2 denotes the payoff of a ( possibly path dependent ) option , and in the past several concepts have been employed for dealing with it .",
    "a common stochastic approach is to perform a monte carlo simulation of numerical approximations to the solution @xmath17 .",
    "typically , the euler or milstein schemes are used to obtain approximations .",
    "also higher order schemes can be applied provided that samples of iterated it integrals are supplied and the coefficients of the equation are sufficiently regular . in general , the problem is tightly related to _ weak approximation _ which is , for instance , extensively studied in the monograph by kloeden and platen @xcite for diffusions .",
    "essentially , one distinguishes between two cases .",
    "either @xmath18 depends only on the state of @xmath17 at a fixed time or alternatively it depends on the whole trajectory of  @xmath17 . in the former case , extrapolation techniques can often be applied to increase the order of convergence , see @xcite . for lvy - driven stochastic differential equations ,",
    "the euler scheme was analyzed in @xcite under the assumption that the increments of the lvy process are simulatable .",
    "approximate simulations of the lvy increments are considered in @xcite .    in this article , we consider functionals @xmath2 that depend on the whole trajectory .",
    "concerning results for diffusions , we refer the reader to the monograph @xcite . for lvy - driven stochastic differential equations , limit theorems in distribution",
    "are provided in @xcite and @xcite for the discrepancy between the genuine solution and euler approximations .",
    "recently , giles @xcite ( see also @xcite ) introduced the so - called _ multilevel monte carlo method _ to compute @xmath19 .",
    "it is very efficient when @xmath17 is a diffusion .",
    "indeed , it even can be shown that it is  in some sense  optimal , see @xcite . for lvy - driven stochastic differential equations ,",
    "multilevel monte carlo algorithms are first introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "let us explain their findings in terms of the blumenthal ",
    "getoor index ( bg - index ) of the driving lvy process which is an index in @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "it measures the frequency of small jumps , see ( [ eq0826 - 1 ] ) , where a large index corresponds to a process which has small jumps at high frequencies . in particular ,",
    "all lvy processes which have a finite number of jumps has bg - index zero .",
    "whenever the bg - index is smaller or equal to one , the algorithms of @xcite have worst case errors at most of order @xmath21 , when the runtime @xmath6 tends to infinity .",
    "unfortunately , the efficiency decreases significantly for larger blumenthal  getoor indices .",
    "typically , it is not feasible to simulate the increments of the lvy process perfectly , and one needs to work with approximations .",
    "this necessity typically worsens the performance of an algorithm , when the bg - index is larger than one due to the higher frequency of small jumps .",
    "it represents the main bottleneck in the simulation . in this article",
    ", we consider approximative lvy increments that simulate the large jumps and approximate the small ones by a normal distribution ( _ gaussian approximation _ ) in the spirit of asmussen and rosiski @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . whenever the bg - index is larger than one , this approach is superior to the approach taken in @xcite , which neglects small jumps in the simulation of lvy increments",
    ".        to be more precise , we establish a new estimate for the wasserstein metric between an approximative solution with gaussian approximation and the genuine solution , see theorem [ th0310 - 1 ] .",
    "it is based on a consequence of zaitsev s generalization @xcite of the komls  major  tusndy coupling @xcite which might be of its own interest itself , see theorem  [ th0217 - 1 ] . with these new estimates , we analyze a class of multilevel monte carlo algorithms together with a _ cost _ function which measures the computational complexity of the individual algorithms .",
    "we provide upper error bounds for individual algorithms and optimize the error over the parameters under a given cost constraint . when the bg - index is larger than one , appropriately adjusted algorithms lead to significantly smaller _ worst case errors _ over the class of lipschitz functionals than the ones analyzed so far , see theorem  [ th : le ] , corollary  [ cor1 ] and figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "in particular , one always obtains numerical schemes with errors at most of order @xmath22 when the runtime @xmath6 of the algorithm tends to infinity .",
