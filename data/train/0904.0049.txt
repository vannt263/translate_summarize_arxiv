    "one of the most amazing predictions offered by the quantum theory of light is what has been called _ vacuum fluctuations _ : even in absence of photons ( vacuum ) the value of the fluctuations of some observables are different from zero .",
    "these fluctuations can not be removed by improving the experimental instrumental , and hence , they are a source of non - technical noise ( _ quantum noise _ ) which seems to establish a limit for the precision of experiments involving light .    during the late seventies and mid - eighties of the past century ways for overcoming this fundamental limit were predicted and experimentally demonstrated @xcite . in the case of the quadratures of light ( equivalent to the position and momentum of a harmonic oscillator ) , the trick was to eliminate ( _ squeeze _ ) quantum noise from one quadrature at the expense of increasing the noise of its canonically conjugated one , in order to preserve their heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "states with this property are called _ squeezed states _ , and they can be generated by means of nonlinear optical processes .",
    "in particular , the largest levels of squeezing are obtained by using nonlinear resonators operating near threshold , this level being degraded quickly as one moves away from that critical point .    up to date , the best squeezing ever achieved is a 90% of noise reduction with respect to vacuum ( the so - called _ standard quantum limit _ ) @xcite , and _ degenerate optical parametric oscillators _ ( dopos ) have been used to this aim .",
    "a dopo consists on a nonlinear @xmath1 crystal placed inside an optical cavity ; when pumped above some threshold level with a laser beam at frequency @xmath2 , a field oscillating at half that frequency ( _ signal _ frequency ) is generated . a linearized analysis of the dopo s quantum fluctuations reveals that the phase quadrature of the signal field can be perfectly squeezed when pump s power is tuned to the dopo s threshold value @xcite . of course , ideal perfect squeezing can not be real in this case , as it would entail an infinite number of photons in the generated mode , and it can be shown that nonlinear corrections make this squeezing level become finite @xcite .    apart from fundamental reasons , improving",
    "the quality of squeezed light is an important task because of its applications .",
    "for example , in the fields of _ quantum information with continuous variables _ @xcite ( as mixing squeezed beams with beam splitters offers the possibility to generate multipartite entangled beams @xcite ) and _ high _ _ precision measurements _ ( such as beam displacement and pointing * * measurements @xcite  or gravitational wave detection @xcite ) , applications of squeezed light have been theoretically and experimentally proved .",
    "recently , our group has developed a strategy that would lead to the generation of light with high level of squeezing at any pump level above threshold in dopos ( _ non - critically squeezed light _ ) .",
    "the idea is to allow for the existence of several transverse modes at the signal frequency in a dopo possessing some spatial symmetry in the transverse plane ( e.g. , rotational or translational ) ; under some circumstances , a pattern breaking the corresponding spatial symmetry can be generated , and quantum noise can randomly move it along the invariant direction ( i.e. , rotate or translate it in the transverse plane ) .",
    "this can be seen as an indefiniteness in the transverse position of the generated pattern , which invoking now the uncertainty principle , could be accompanied by the perfect determination of its associated momentum ( angular or linear ) .",
    "hence , we could expect noise reduction in the empty pattern coinciding with the momentum of the generated pattern .",
    "moreover , as this is related to the spontaneous symmetry breaking , the perfect squeezing should occur at any pump level above threshold .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the translational symmetry breaking was considered in broad area , planar dopos , where cavity solitons ( css ) , as well as extended patterns , have been predicted to exist @xcite .",
    "it was shown that all the reasoning above is true : the position of the cs diffuses in the transverse plane , and the phase quadrature of the pattern coinciding with its linear momentum ( namely its @xmath3 phase shifted transverse gradient ) is perfectly squeezed ( within the linearized theory ) at any pump level above threshold .",
    "the problem of this model is that it is not too close to current experimental setups and even css have not yet been observed in dopos .",
    "this was one of the reasons why the theory of a simpler system was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite : a rotationally symmetric dopo tuned to the first family of transverse modes at the signal frequency @xcite .",
    "the first transverse - mode family supports laguerre - gauss ( lg ) modes @xmath4 with @xmath5 orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , where @xmath6 are the transverse coordinates .",
    "when pumped with a gaussian mode with zero oam , two signal photons with opposite oam are generated in the @xmath1 crystal .",
    "alternatively , the simultaneous generation of one @xmath7 photon and another @xmath8 one corresponds to the generation of two hermite - gauss ( hg ) tem@xmath0 photons , the orientation of this tem@xmath0 mode ( @xmath9 in fig .",
    "1 ) given by half the phase difference between the subjacent @xmath10 modes . again in this case , we proved our reasoning given above : quantum noise is able to rotate randomly this bright mode , and the phase quadrature of its angular momentum ( its @xmath11 phase shifted angular derivative ) , which corresponds in this case to another hg mode orthogonal to the generated one ( we will refer to it as the dark mode ) , is perfectly squeezed within the linearized theory and at any pump level above threshold @xcite .",
    "in addition we showed that this result is quite robust against deviations from the perfect rotational invariance of the dopo .",
    "dopo.eps + figure 1.- scheme of the 2-transverse - mode dopo .",
    "moreover , a surprising result was found : although the phase quadrature of the dark mode is perfectly squeezed , its corresponding amplitude quadrature has not increased uncertainty , i.e. , the quadratures of this rotating mode do not form a canonical pair .",
    "we intuitively explained this by noting that the excess of noise is transferred not to another quadrature , but to the orientation @xmath9 of the pattern , which actually is the canonical pair of the squeezed quadrature ; in the present article we prove this statement by using the arguments developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "indeed , the study of this rotationally symmetric dopo was carried out under some assumptions whose repercussion will be analyzed in the current article .",
    "first , we supposed that cavity losses at the signal frequency were small as compared with that at the pump frequency , what allowed us to adiabatically eliminate the pump variables .",
    "next , the usual linearization of the nonlinear langevin equations around their classical stationary solution was done . finally , in order to prove the non - critical squeezing we proposed an homodyne detection scheme in which the local oscillator was a tem@xmath0 mode matched to the dark mode at any time",
    ", i.e. , it was following the random rotation of this mode , an ideal situation which is not possible in real experiments .",
    "now , let us summarize what we are going to show in this article , which is divided into four main parts .",
    "in the first one ( section ii ) we describe the dopo tuned to the first transverse family ( the _ 2-transverse - mode dopo _ ) and find its associated quantum langevin equations . in section iii , we study the classical emission of the system , and show how the rotational symmetry is broken by the generated transverse pattern .",
    "section iv is the main section of the article : the quantum properties of the dopo are analyzed by linearizing the langevin equations . here",
    "we will prove the random rotation of the classical pattern , and find the squeezing properties of the bright and dark modes .",
    "in addition , we will show that the quadratures of the dark mode do not form a canonical set , but they are canonically related to the pattern orientation ( where the excess of noise goes ) .",
    "we close this section by analyzing the repercussion of keeping fixed the orientation of the local oscillator , showing that even in this case large levels of squeezing can be obtained . in the last part ( section v )",
    "we show that the approximations considered in the previous sections ( the adiabatic elimination of the pump and the linearization procedure ) are not responsible for the remarkable squeezing properties of the dark mode , as they follow directly from the spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking . at the end ( section vi ) we will give some conclusions . in order to make clearer the physics behind the phenomenon , we have left most of the technical details to appendices .",
    "one of the simplest configurations of the dopo s cavity allowing for the generation of a rotationally asymmetric pattern is the following @xcite : at some phase - matched frequency @xmath2 it is tuned to a fundamental gaussian transverse mode @xmath12 , while at half that frequency , @xmath13 , the first transverse family is resonant . in the first transverse family",
    "two laguerre - gauss modes exist , @xmath4 . the exact expression of the modes in the waist plane of the resonator ( where the @xmath1 crystal is placed ) is given by @xcite@xmath14 where @xmath15 is the coordinate vector in the transverse plane , and @xmath16 is the beam radius at the waist plane , which depends on the cavity geometry and the resonance frequency of the mode ( see appendix a ) .",
    "these transverse modes have @xmath17 and @xmath5 oam respectively , as they are eigenmodes of the oam operator @xmath18 with those eigenvalues .",
    "the field inside the cavity can be written then as@xmath19 with@xmath20 being @xmath21 the refractive index of the crystal and @xmath22 the effective cavity length ( h.c",
    ". stands for hermitian conjugate ) .",
    "the slowly varying envelopes are given by    [ sve]@xmath23 where the boson operators satisfy the usual equal time commutation relations    @xmath24   = \\delta_{mn};\\text { } m , n=0,\\pm1.\\ ] ]    instead of using the lg basis , one can work in the most usual tem@xmath25 ( hg ) basis .",
    "denoting by @xmath26 and @xmath27 a tem@xmath0 mode rotated an angle @xmath28 with respect to the @xmath29 axis and its orthogonal , these are given by    [ hg]@xmath30   \\label{hg10}\\\\ &   = \\sqrt{2}\\left\\vert l_{\\pm1}\\left (   \\mathbf{r}\\right )   \\right\\vert \\cos\\left (   \\phi-\\psi\\right )   \\nonumber\\\\ h_{01}^{\\psi}\\left (   \\mathbf{r}\\right )    &   = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}i}\\left [ e^{-i\\psi}l_{+1}\\left (   \\mathbf{r}\\right )   -e^{i\\psi}l_{-1}\\left ( \\mathbf{r}\\right )   \\right ]   \\label{hg01}\\\\ &   = \\sqrt{2}\\left\\vert l_{\\pm1}\\left (   \\mathbf{r}\\right )   \\right\\vert \\sin\\left (   \\phi-\\psi\\right )   .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can thus define boson operators associated to these modes , whose relation with the lg ones is    [ lgtohg]@xmath31 these relations will be important in order to understand the properties of the system .    finally , note that for any mode @xmath32 , quadrature @xmath33 can be defined as    @xmath34    and quadratures with @xmath35 and @xmath36 are usually called amplitude and phase quadratures , and will be denoted by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "once the structure of the field inside the cavity has been described , we can pass to describe its evolution , and to this aim a hamiltonian must be built .",
    "it has to take into account two processes : the pumping of the coherent , gaussian , resonant laser source at frequency @xmath2 , and the parametric down conversion of the pump photons into signal photons occurring in the @xmath1 crystal . in the interaction picture , this hamiltonian",
    "is given by@xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are proportional to the injected pump amplitude and to the second order nonlinear susceptibility of the nonlinear crystal respectively .",
    "explicit expressions of these parameters in terms of physical quantities are given in appendix a. we take @xmath40 as real , i.e. , we take the phase of the pump laser as the reference phase for all the other fields .",
    "the first part of the hamiltonian is the usual pump hamiltonian @xcite , while the second part is easily justified by energy and oam conservation : from one @xmath2 photon with zero oam , two @xmath42 photons are created with opposite oam , or viceversa .",
    "note that this hamiltonian is equivalent to that for the nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator considered for example in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there exists one more process not taken into account in this hamiltonian : the losses through the cavity mirrors .",
    "this is an irreversible process which can not be described with a hamiltonian formalism that takes into account only the cavity dynamics .",
    "however , assuming that the outer of the cavity consists of a continuum of modes in a vacuum ( or coherent ) state which weakly interact with the internal modes through the partially reflecting mirror , it can be incorporated into the master equation satisfied by the density operator of the system as shown for example in ref .",
    "moreover , the master equation can be converted into a set of stochastic ( langevin ) differential equations by using a positive _ p _ representation for the density operator @xcite . in our case , as is shown in @xcite , the equivalent set of langevin equations is@xmath43",

    "note that these stochastic equations are equal in either the ito or stratonovich forms ( see appendix b ) , and hence we interpret them as stratonovich equations which allow us to apply ordinary calculus .    in order to better visualize the free parameters of the model ,",
    "let us define new rescaled time and amplitudes through@xmath54 and similar expressions for the conjugate fields @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "note that as time is measured in units of @xmath57 , the noises must be rescaled also as@xmath58 and similarly for @xmath59 , if we want to preserve their statistical properties ( [ noisecorr ] ) in terms of the adimensional time @xmath60 .",
    "finally , these changes make langevin equations ( [ langevin ] ) read ( of course , derivatives are respect with the new dimensionless time)@xmath61   ^{\\ast},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which have only the following 3 dimensionless parameters:@xmath62",
    "before analyzing the quantum properties of the system , let us examine the emission of this dopo as predicted by classical optics .",
    "it is possible to retrieve the classical equations of the 2-transverse - mode dopo from the quantum langevin ones ( [ reescaledlangevin ] ) by setting all the noises to zero and making @xmath63 ( @xmath32 refers to any mode of the problem ) .",
    "we are interested in finding the stationary emission , and then set to zero the time derivatives of the amplitudes , arriving to@xmath64    before solving these equations , let us stress that these are invariant under the following transformation@xmath65 and hence the phase difference between opposite oam modes is classically undetermined .    by decomposing into modulus and",
    "phase the amplitudes @xmath66 , it is straightforward to find the solutions of the system ( [ classicaleqs ] ) .",

    "if we substitute the last result for the signal modes in the expression of the corresponding slowly varying envelope ( [ sves ] ) , we find the generated pattern to be@xmath72   = \\sqrt{2}\\rho h_{10}^{\\theta}\\left (   \\mathbf{r}\\right )   \\text{,}\\ ] ] which is a tem@xmath0 mode forming an angle @xmath9 with respect to the @xmath29 axis ( [ hg ] ) as shown in fig . 1 . due to the arbitrariness of @xmath9",
    ", the pattern can arise with any orientation ; this reflects the rotational invariance of the system , wich in turn is broken after the tem@xmath0 mode generation .    in the following ,",
    "we will call @xmath73 the _ bright mode _ ( as it is classically excited ) and its orthogonal mode @xmath74 the _ dark mode _ ( as it is classically empty of photons ) , and will define the collective indices @xmath75 and @xmath76 to simplify the notation .",
    "we are going to discuss the quantum properties of the down converted field by inspection of the quantum langevin equations ( [ reescaledlangevin ] ) in the limit @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 , where the pump variables can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "we will show later ( section v ) that all the important properties found in this limit are valid in general .",
    "one common way of treating the adiabatic elimination of the pump consists on setting @xmath79 in the first two equations of ( [ reescaledlangevin ] ) . however , this method has a problem : the initial langevin equations are equal in either ito or stratonovich forms , but the new langevin equations obtained for the signal modes does nt have this property ( see appendix b ) .",
    "hence it is fair to ask within which interpretation ( ito or stratonovich ) is that procedure correct , if it is correct at all . as proved in @xcite by performing the adiabatic elimination in the fokker - planck equation ( where there are no problems of interpretation )",
    ", the usual method for eliminating the pump is correct within ito s interpretation , and hence the stratonovich form of the stochastic equations satisfied by the signal modes only has an unexpected extra term proportional to @xmath80 ( see appendix b ) and reads:@xmath81   ^{\\ast},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with@xmath82    in order to find analytic predictions from these equations , we assume well above threshold operating conditions , where classical emission dominates , thus allowing for a linearization procedure",
    ". the correct way to perform this was described in @xcite , and relies on the smallness of the @xmath83 parameter ( see appendix a ) . in particular , making a perturbative expansion of the amplitudes in terms of this parameter , it is possible to show that the classical equations are recovered as the @xmath84 order of the expansion in eqs .",
    "( [ adeleqs ] ) , while the linear quantum correction appears in the @xmath85 order ( note that the noise term is already of order @xmath85 ) .",
    "hence , the usual linearization procedure begins by writing the amplitudes as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and treat the fluctuations as order @xmath83 perturbations .",
    "however , as stated in the introduction , in the system we are dealing with we expect that quantum noise rotates the generated tem@xmath0 mode , and hence fluctuations of the fields in an arbitrary direction of phase space could not be small ( i.e. , order @xmath83 )",

    "in addition , expanding the fields in this way allows us to track the evolution of the classical pattern s orientation , as we take @xmath9 as an explicit quantum variable .",

    "_ _ in the introduction we defined squeezed light as that having some quadrature fluctuating below the vacuum level .",
    "hence , in order to find out whether a light beam is in a squeezed state or not , one has to measure its _ quadrature _ _ fluctuations _ and then compare them with the value set by the vacuum state .",
    "the question then is : what quantity accounts for quadrature fluctuations of a light beam ?",
    "of course , in the case of a single mode of light this quantity can be directly the uncertainty of the quadrature .",
    "however , outside the cavity there exists a continuum of modes , and the quantity accounting for these fluctuations has to be adapted to what can be most easily observed in an experiment .    as was first shown in @xcite , the quantity accounting for fluctuations of quadrature @xmath33 outside the cavity ( @xmath32 refers to any signal spatial mode of our 2-transverse - mode dopo ) is@xmath108 with @xmath109 where the factor @xmath110 appears after including our rescaled variables ( [ rescaled ] ) .",
    "we will call @xmath111 the _ noise spectrum _ and @xmath112 the _ squeezing spectrum_. frequency @xmath113 is usually called _ noise frequency _ , and it must not be confused with the optical frequency . in fact , noise frequency @xmath113 has contributions of every pair of modes lying in opposite sidebands around the optical frequency @xmath114 , where @xmath13 is the carrier frequency of the detected beam ( do nt miss that in our case this frequency is measured in units of @xmath47 ) .",
    "@xmath111 can be measured via a balanced homodyne detection experiment : a coherent , intense field ( local oscillator field ) prepared in mode @xmath32 , and with a phase @xmath115 is mixed with the beam exiting the dopo in a 50/50 beam splitter ; it is easy to show that the operator associated to the intensity difference between the two output ports of the beam splitter is proportional to the quadrature @xmath116 of the beam exiting the dopo .",
    "hence , the normalized correlation spectrum of the intensity difference ( which can be measured with a simple spectrum analyzer ) coincides with expression ( [ vout ] ) .",
    "factor 2 in ( [ susual ] ) comes from the relation between the intracavity and the output modes when the input modes ( the pump laser and the outer modes ) are coherent ; this factor is @xmath117 when time ( frequency ) is not normalized to @xmath118(@xmath47 ) .    in the above expression for the squeezing spectrum",
    ", it is assumed that the emission of the dopo reaches a stationary state ( i.e. , the correlation function of @xmath119 at two different times @xmath60 and @xmath120 depends only on the time difference @xmath121 ) and that the observation time , say @xmath122 , is large as compared with the coherence time of @xmath119 . in the 2-transverse - mode dopo",
    "there exists an undamped quantity excited by quantum noise , @xmath9 , and hence , any quantity with explicit dependence on it will not arrive to a stationary state .",
    "thus , under some circumstances we will need the expression of the squeezing spectrum measured when the field is not stationary , which was derived in @xcite . in that reference",
    "it is shown that when the measurement extends during a time interval @xmath122 ( normalized to @xmath118 in our expressions ) the squeezing spectrum reads@xmath123 , \\label{sgen}\\ ] ] which obviously reduces to ( [ susual ] ) if the emission is stationary .",
    "for the vacuum state @xmath124 , hence if @xmath125 for some frequency @xmath126 , we can say that the detected light is in a squeezed state for mode @xmath32 at noise frequency @xmath126 .",
    "finally , let us stress that we will evaluate quantum correlations as those involved in ( [ sgen ] ) via stochastic correlations , as allowed by property ( [ n - st ] ) .",

    "independent quadratures and non critical squeezing . * a first step towards analyzing the squeezing properties of the field within the framework presented above , is identifying a set of independent quadratures .",
    "this is easy in our case , as the eigenmodes @xmath127 give us a set of quadratures with well defined squeezing properties .",
    "in particular , from ( [ linexp ] ) , ( [ lgtohg ] ) , and ( [ quadrature ] ) , it is easy to find the following relations@xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the amplitude and phase quadratures of the bright and dark modes , @xmath131 and @xmath74 , respectively .    the evolution of these quadratures can be found from the equations satisfied by the projections ( [ projlinlan ] ) , which are solved in appendix d ( remember that @xmath132 ) .",
    "in particular , there we show that after some time these projections reach a stationary state , and hence we can evaluate the noise spectrum of the quadratures by using the stationary expression for the squeezing spectrum ( [ susual ] ) . using the results found in appendix d for the correlation spectrum of the projections ( [ cspectrum ] ) ,",
    "it is straightforward to find the following  results    [ noisespectra]@xmath133    we see that the quadratures of the bright mode have the same behavior as those of the single mode dopo : the phase quadrature @xmath134 is perfectly squeezed @xmath135 at zero noise frequency @xmath136 only at the bifurcation @xmath137 .    on the other hand , the dark mode has perfect squeezing in its phase quadrature @xmath138 at zero noise frequency .",
    "what is interesting is that this result is independent of the distance from threshold , and thus , it is a non - critical phenomenon .",
    "this result was first shown in @xcite , and we can understand it by following the reasoning given in the introduction : as the orientation @xmath9 of the classically excited pattern is undetermined in the long - time limit , its oam must be fully determined at low noise frequencies . on the other hand ,",
    "the oam of the bright mode @xmath73 is nothing but its @xmath3 phase shifted orthogonal hg mode , i.e. , @xmath139 , which used as a local oscillator in an homodyne detection experiment would lead to the observation of the @xmath138 quadrature fluctuations .    * on canonical pairs and noise transfer*. although all the results we have discussed up to now were expected to occur after the arguments given in the introduction , a strange unexpected result has appeared in ( [ noisespectra ] ) : the quadratures of the dark mode seem to violate the uncertainty principle as @xmath140 .    moreover , the noise spectrum of an arbitrary quadrature of the dark mode , which can be written in terms of its amplitude and phase quadratures as @xmath141 , is    @xmath142    what shows that all the quadratures of the dark mode ( except its amplitude quadrature ) are squeezed .",
    "thus two orthogonal quadratures can not form a canonical pair as they satisfy the relation @xmath143 in clear violation of the uncertainty principle .",
    "the natural question now is : where does the excess of noise go if it is not transferred from one quadrature to its orthogonal one ?",
    "the answer is that it goes to the pattern orientation , which is actually fully undetermined in the long term as we showed above ( [ theta var ] ) .",
    "this section is devoted to prove this statement .",
    "in particular we will prove that two orthogonal quadratures of the dark mode do not form a canonical pair , while the orientation @xmath9 is the canonical pair of all the squeezed quadratures .",
    "one way to prove this would be to evaluate the commutator between the quantum operators involved .",

    "in conclusion , we have developed in detail the quantum theory of the 2-transverse - mode dopo introduced in @xcite .",
    "we have studied some important features not considered in that reference :    * when pumping with a gaussian mode a rotationally symmetric dopo properly tuned to the first family of transverse modes at the signal frequency , classical emission takes place in a tem@xmath0 mode with an arbitrary orientation in the transverse plane .",
    "hence , once the threshold is crossed , the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken , and we can talk about a bright mode ( the generated one which breaks the symmetry ) and a dark mode ( the mode orthogonal to the generated one ) . *",
    "the symmetry breaking reflects in the appearance of a goldstone mode in the matrix governing the linear evolution of the fluctuations above threshold .",
    "the null eigenvalue of this mode allows quantum noise to change the orientation of the bright mode randomly . though continuously increasing with time",
    ", this rotation of the classically excited pattern is quite slow when working above threshold . * as for the squeezing properties , it has been proved that the bright mode has the same behavior as the single - mode dopo , i.e. , perfect squeezing appears only at threshold ( within the linearized theory ) and degrades fast as pump is moved apart from this level . on the other hand , accompanying the goldstone mode it appears another mode whose associated eigenvalue takes the minimum possible value @xmath261 .",
    "these modes are responsible of the remarkable properties of the dark mode : its phase quadrature is perfectly squeezed at any pump level , while its amplitude quadrature carries only with vacuum fluctuations @xcite ( in apparent violation of the uncertainty principle ) .",
    "a simple explanation of this phenomenon in terms of `` angle - angular momentum '' uncertainty relation appears once one notices that the dark mode coincides ( up to a @xmath3 phase ) with the oam of the generated pattern .",
    "* we have proved that the apparent violation of the uncertainty principle is just that , apparent , as the conjugate pair of the squeezed quadrature is not another quadrature but the orientation of the bright mode , which in fact is completely undetermined in the long term . *",
    "next we have pointed out that in order to measure the quantum properties of the dark mode , one has to use a tem@xmath0 local oscillator that is perfectly matched to the orientation of this mode at any time .",
    "however , the mode is rotating randomly , which seems to make impossible the perfect matching .",
    "for this reason we have studied the situation in which the local oscillator is matched to the dark mode s orientation only at the initial time , remaining fixed during the detection time .",
    "we have shown that arbitrarily large levels of noise reduction can be obtained even in this case if the phase of the local oscillator is exactly @xmath3 .",
    "we then considered phase deviations up to 2@xmath259 ( 1.5@xmath259 seems to be the current experimental limit @xcite ) , comparing the results with that predicted for the single - mode dopo ; similar levels are obtained for both , with the advantage that in the 2-transverse - mode dopo this level is independent of the distance from threshold , and hence , non - critical .",
    "* in the last part of the article we have shown that the assumptions made in order to analytically solve the problem are not the responsible for the quantum properties of the dark mode . in particular , we have shown that when the pump is not adiabatically eliminated , the goldstone mode and its companion with the lowest possible eigenvalue remain unchanged in the matrix governing the linear evolution of the full problem , and hence all the properties derived from them are still present .",
    "finally , we have used numerical simulations to show that the predictions of the linearized equations are in perfect agreement with those of the full nonlinear equations , and hence the perfect , non - critical squeezing of the dark mode is not a by - product of the linearization .",
    "we believe that the analyses presented in this paper ( together with the fact that the properties of the dark mode are not too sensitive to imperfections in the rotational symmetry of the dopo @xcite , and that the phenomenon is present in other kinds of nonlinear resonators @xcite ) show that that the phenomenon of non - critical squeezing induced by spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking is a robust phenomenon .",
