    "advection constitutes a transport mechanism of either a substance or a conserved property by a fluid .",
    "this process originates in the fluid s bulk motion . for instance , the transport of silt in a river by bulk water flowing downstream .",
    "thermodynamic advected quantities are energy and enthalpy .",
    "any substance or conserved , extensive quantity can experience advection by a fluid that contains it .",
    "advection does not include transport by molecular diffusion . in this work",
    "we analyze some features of an evolution equation characterizing the combined effects of i ) advection and ii ) a diffusion process described by fractional partial derivatives .",
    "the ensuing fractional advection - diffusion equation has been recently applied to the study of the transport of energetic particles in the interplanetary environment @xcite .",
    "there is a considerable body of evidence , from data collected by spacecrafts like _ ulysses _ and _ voyager 2 _ , indicating that the transport of energetic particles in the turbulent heliospheric medium is superdiffusive @xcite .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted in recent years to the development of superdiffusive models for the transport of electrons and protons in the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "this kind of transport regime exhibits a power - law growth of the mean square displacement of the diffusing particles , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the special case @xmath2 is called ballistic transport .",
    "the limit case @xmath3 corresponds to normal diffusion , described by the well - known gaussian propagator .",
    "the energetic particles detected by the aforementioned probes are usually associated with violent solar events like solar flares .",
    "these particles diffuse in the solar wind , which is a turbulent environment than can be assumed statistically homogeneous at large enough distances from the sun @xcite .",
    "this implies that the propagator @xmath4 , describing the probability of finding at the space time location @xmath5 a particle that has been injected at @xmath6 , depends solely on the differences @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the superdiffusive regime",
    "the propagator @xmath4 is not gaussian , and exhibits power - law tails .",
    "it arises as solution a non local diffusive process governed by an integral equation that can be recast under the guise of a diffusion equation where the well - known laplacian term is replaced by a term involving fractional derivatives @xcite .",
    "diffusion equations with fractional derivatives have attracted considerable attention recently ( see @xcite and references therein ) and have lots of potential applications @xcite . in particular , the observed distributions of solar cosmic ray particles are often consistent with power - law tails , suggesting that a superdiffusive process is at work .    a proper understanding of the transport of energetic particles in space is a vital ingredient for the analysis of various important phenomena , such as the propagation of particles from the sun to our planet or , more generally , the acceleration and transport of cosmic rays .",
    "the superdiffusion of particles in interplanetary turbulent environments is often modelled using asymptotic expressions for the pertinent non - gaussian propagator , which have a limited range of validity .",
    "a first step towards a more accurate analytical treatment of this problem was recently provided by litvinenko and effenberger ( le ) in @xcite .",
    "le considered solutions of a fractional diffusion - advection equation describing the diffusion of particles emitted at a shock front that propagates at a constant upstream speed @xmath9 in the solar wind rest frame .",
    "the shock front is assumed to be planar , leading to an effectively one - dimensional problem .",
    "each physical quantity depends only on the time @xmath10 and on the spatial coordinate @xmath11 measured along an axis perpendicular to the shock front .    in the present contribution",
    "we re - visit the fractional diffusion - advection equation and provide explicit , exact closed analytical solutions , without approximations .",
    "we also undertake a numerical analysis that shows the these solutions resemble power - laws .",
    "we deal with the equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the distribution function for solar cosmic - rays transport . here",
    "the fractional spatial derivative is defined as @xcite @xmath15 to solve this equation one appeals to the the green function governed by the equation : @xmath16 ) can be expressed as @xmath17 in this work we obtain the solutions of eqs .",

    "we have provided an explicit analytical solution for and advection - diffusion equation involving fractional derivatives in the diffusion term .",
    "this equation governs the diffusion of particles in the solar wind injected at the front of a shock that travels at a constant upstream speed @xmath9 in the solar wind rest frame .",
    "the shock is assumed to have a planar front , leading to a problem with an effective one dimensional geometry , where all the relevant quantities depend solely on time and on the coordinate @xmath11 measured along an axis perpendicular to the front .",
    "we obtained the exact solution of the above mentioned equation in the @xmath11-configuration space ( besides the associated formal solution in the @xmath45-space related to the previous one via a fourier transform ) .",
