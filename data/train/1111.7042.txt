    "the milky way has clearly not finished assembling , as the two magellanic clouds are coalescing into the galaxy . as stochastic satellite infall continues in the galactic halo , it gives us a chance to bootstrap our cosmological theories of structure formation to the local observables . by measuring the signatures of accretion of galactic fragments",
    " manifested in streams of stripped gas and stars  onto the milky way , we can study the galaxy s underlying matter distribution .    of the galactic satellites surviving to date ,",
    "the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy is one of the most massive , third after the lmc and smc ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is however , not going to survive for much longer .",
    "after its discovery by @xcite , it was quickly realized that the sgr dwarf was losing its stars to the galactic tides at a high rate ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it was only when most of the sky was imaged by the 2mass and the sdss surveys that the amount of damage done to sgr became really apparent ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "currently , it is established that the stellar debris torn from the dwarf wraps around the galaxy at least once , i.e. leading and trailing tails can be each seen covering over @xmath1 radians on the sky @xcite .",
    "hundreds of stars in the sgr tails have their radial velocities measured and some of these also have reliable chemical abundances @xcite .",
    "a number of star clusters are believed to have originated in sgr and are now left free - floating in the milky way halo after having been torn from the disrupting galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .    unfortunately , the unbound stars ( and star clusters ) are not simply tagged according to their past sgr membership . instead , objects are typically classified as such based on their proximity to the sgr orbital plane , their heliocentric distances and radial velocities .",
    "models have had some considerable success explaining this data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but difficulties remain . in particular , the virgo over - density @xcite and the `` bifurcation '' of the leading tail @xcite are both examples of substructures that lie close to the sgr plane whose origins remain obscure .",
    "although there were attempts to include these in the picture of sgr disruption ( e.g @xcite ) , it now seems that little progress has been made .    finally , another stream ( the cetus stream ) on a polar orbit has recently been announced to overlap with sgr debris in the southern galactic hemisphere by @xcite .",
    "although this has a different kinematical signature to sgr , it coincides in space and metallicity .",
    "untangling the debris in the south is crucial to an understanding of the cetus stream , as well as the sgr .",
    "this is the first of two observational papers in which we report new insights into the formation of the sgr stream and its neighbouring stellar halo substructures . in a companion paper",

    "where the streams cross stripe 82 , we can take advantage of the coadded photometry  @xcite , which reaches @xmath2 2 magnitudes deeper than the single epoch sdss measurements .",
    "we use photometric metallicities to demonstrate that the two streams have different chemical properties . untangling the substructure",
    "is considerably complicated by the existence of a further stream , already noticed by @xcite and dubbed the cetus stream .",

    "such coordinate systems , whose equator aligns with the stream , have already proved useful in similar studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "using the notation of @xcite , we introduce coordinates ( @xmath18 ) given by their eqn ( 9 ) .",
    "the equator of this spherical cooordinate system coincides with the sgr debris midplane .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fos_dr8 ] shows the data in this coordinate system , with the sgr debris now straddling the equator .",
    "this reveals that , in the new projection , rather than a `` bifurcation '' of the sgr stream ( the somewhat misleading term introduced in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the stellar density appears resolved into two , sometimes superposed , independent streams with seemingly different angular widths and density profiles .",
    "we are led to the conclusion that everywhere where the sgr tidal debris can be detected in sdss there exists at least one additional density component following or over - lapping the sgr stream . in what follows , we will attempt to empirically describe and untangle these structures by examining their density profiles , distances and chemical abundances .",
    "we begin by quantifying the difference in the centroids , widths and density profiles of the streams visible in the south galactic region .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : crosssects ] shows the density of msto stars across the stream in the region ( @xmath19 ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show the density of m giants extracted from the 2 micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , see e.g. , @xcite ) using the cuts from @xcite , namely @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "both profiles show clear evidence for bimodality , though it is unclear whether the two structures are distinct or overlapping .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : crosssects ] shows cross - sections across the stream in different slices .",
    "as we march along the stream , at least in the region @xmath23 , the cross - section remains quite invariant , but the offset of the secondary stream from the main stream changes gently with longitude .",
    "let us assume that the one - dimensional profile of each stream is a gaussian whose centroid and full width at half maximum may vary with longitude .",
    "this simple model of the stellar density in a tidal stream is of course not completely physical , but nevertheless should be sufficient to describe the pieces of the streams in the south .",
    "we now extract the centroids and widths by fitting two gaussians to the starcount data .",
    "figure  [ fig : twogauss ] shows their behavior as a function of longitude @xmath24 along the stream . perhaps unsurprisingly , the tracks of the centers of two streams are not exactly parallel , but they are slightly converging .",
    "nonetheless , it is surprising that the convergence point is not close to the sgr remnant ( marked as a red star ) .",
    "this gap decrease along the stream is already a broad hint that the the two structures seen in figure  [ fig : crosssects ] are separate streams following similar but slightly different orbital paths , as opposed to a single stream with substructure . in table",
    "[ tab : locs ] we provide the data on the centroids of the streams used for figure[fig : crosssects ] .",
    "although @xcite used the term `` bifurcation '' to describe the sgr stream in the north , the new data and analysis suggests that the term is misleading  rather , in both the north and the south , the stellar density appears to be resolved into two independent streams with different angular widths .    of course",
    ", we have made the assumption that the profiles are gaussian .",
    "there is evidence from simulations that stream profiles can be lop - sided @xcite . with the current data , it is not possible to distinguish with absolute certainty between the hypotheses of two streams and a single lopsided stream .",
    "nonetheless , in our opinion , the presence of two peaks in the m giants , the detailed shape of the msto density profile and the behavior of centroids argues in favour of the hypothesis of two streams .",
    "distances to many different parts of the sgr stream have been measured in the past using various stellar tracers : carbon stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , bhbs ( e.g. @xcite ) , sub - giant branch stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , red - clump stars ( e.g. @xcite ) and rr lyrae variables ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , when combined to provide as continuous a coverage of the stream as possible , the results of these methods do not always appear to be fully consistent .",
    "distances to the stream in the south still rely on the comprehensive study of m giants extracted from the 2mass dataset ( e.g. @xcite ) .    here , we will rely on the sdss photometric data and concentrate on the area in the southern galactic hemisphere where the stream is imaged contiguously .",
    "our aim is to construct clean hess diagrams of the two streams so as to analyse their stellar populations .",
    "distances , or more accurately , relative distances along the stream are needed .",
    "if uncorrected for distance gradients , the features in our hess diagrams lose sharpness . here , we will use red clump and subgiant stars as distance indicators .    to construct the hess diagrams , we make use of the fact that the galaxy is , to a good approximation , symmetric about the galactic plane .",
    "the blue dotted line in figure  [ fig : fos_dr8 ] outlines the area in the north corresponding to the main patch of southern sdss data mirrored in the galactic plane . in figure",
    "[ fig : hess ] , we show the hess diagram of the sgr streams in the range @xmath25 and @xmath9 . we have subtracted the equivalent mirrored patch as a proxy for the background region .",
    "the existence of multiple stellar populations is immediately apparent from the richness and thickness of the features in the hess diagram .",
    "we can identify a fattened msto , subgiant and red giant branches , as well as populations of bhbs and bss .",
    "nonetheless , our background subtraction is not perfect and is the cause of some graininess in the figure , especially at brighter magnitudes .",
    "this is particularly troublesome in the region of the red clump stars .",
    "some of the blurring and thickening of features is of course due to the fact that the heliocentric distance is changing along the streams .",
    "our next step is to measure the distance gradient , which we quantify by studying two different tracer populations in figure  [ fig : hess ] .",
    "we select red clump stars by the colour cut ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath26 with a little more effort , we can select subgiant stars using the a linear combination of @xmath15 and @xmath16 colors , namely @xmath27 for both populations , we show 2d histograms of @xmath14 band magnitude versus longitude along the stream @xmath24 in figure  [ fig : distgrad ] .",
    "we see that the gradient is linear to an excellent approximation , and reassuringly the same for both populations . in this area of sky ,",
    "the longitudinal gradient is @xmath20.023 mag deg@xmath17 .",
    "the distances measured along the brighter stream from the the red clump population are shown in the table  [ tab : sgr_dist ] under the assumption that @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "having identified the relative distances of populations along the stream , we can correct for the gradient and obtain cleaner hess diagrams , as shown in figure  [ fig : superhess ] . here",
    ", the left panel refers to the brighter stream @xmath29 ) , while the right panel to the fainter stream @xmath30 .",
    "it is noticeable that the hess diagram of the fainter stream shows much thinner sub - giant and red - branch regions .",
    "furthermore , it does not possess multiple turn - offs and a prominent red - clump like the brighter southern stream . to check that the latter is not an artefact caused by low number statistics in the faint stream , we modelled the ratio of red clump to msto stars using a decomposition of the density profile into two gaussians ( as used for fig .",
    "[ fig : crosssects ] ) . with 95 % confidence ,",
    "this ratio in the fainter stream is smaller than that in the brighter .",
    "this suggests the existence of a simpler and more metal - poor population in the fainter stream , and more complex and more metal - rich population in the brighter stream .    we can confirm this result by making use of the stripe 82 data .",
    "stripe 82 has multi - band and multi - epoch imaging , which @xcite exploited to build a catalogue that reaches @xmath2 2 magnitudes deeper than the single epoch sdss measurements .",
    "we compute photometric metallicities using the formula provided by @xcite and report the results in figure  [ fig : metallicities ] both for stripe 82 ( left panel ) with @xmath31 and for the sgr streams in the north between @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "since stripe 82 crosses the sgr streams at a significant angle , it is important to understand that the left part of the plot corresponds to the @xmath34 region while the right corresponds to @xmath35 , which is much closer to the sgr progenitor . despite this limitation",
    ", figure  [ fig : metallicities ] shows clearly that the brighter stream has significant numbers of high metallicity stars , while the secondary stream has fewer .     and @xmath36 .",

    "of course , there is a long history of use of bhb stars for studying structure in the stellar halo .",
    "the stars are relatively abundant , and they occupy a narrow absolute magnitude range , which makes them valuable distance indicators . however , there has been a slight confusion as to the absolute magnitude of a typical bhb star in the sdss filter system : for example @xcite and @xcite have used @xmath37 , while @xcite advocate the use of @xmath38 .",
    "it also known that the bhb absolute magnitude is also a function of color and metallicity .",
    "fortunately , we do not need to address this issue here , as we will mostly use relative distances .",
    "guided by the photometric properties of the globular cluster bhbs studied by @xcite , we choose to use the following simple color cuts to select candidate bhb stars in the sdss data : @xmath39 . at higher values of @xmath16 ,",
    "the contamination from main sequence stars increases sharply .",
    "of course , this color selection also identifies out the bs stars @xcite .",
    "we therefore might expect that the density distribution along the distance axis typically shows two enhancements corresponding to bhb and bs stars separated by @xmath2 2 magnitudes .",
    "note that the bhbs have a narrow band of intrinsic luminosities and so generate tight structures , whereas the bss are poorer distance indicators and produce more diffuse structures  ( see e.g. , figure 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : bhbs ] shows the density of stars satisfying our colour cut as a function of apparent magnitude and longitude .",
    "there are indeed two evident structures present , but they do not correspond to two roughly parallel density peaks which might be naturally interpreted as bs and bhbs from the same structure . rather the figure forces upon us the interpretation that there are two classes of objects arising from two distinct structures : the thick structure possesses the same longitudinal distance gradient as the subgiant and red clump stars , and this can be identified with bss from the sgr stream .",
    "the other , thinner structure has the opposite distance gradient , and we shall see that these are bhb stars lying in an entirely different structure , namely the cetus stream .",
    "the discovery of the cetus stream was announced by @xcite .",
    "they noticed a stream - like overdensity in low metallicity stars in sdss dr7 that crosses the sgr stream in the south at @xmath40 .",
    "the cetus stream can be distinguished from the sgr on the basis of its markedly lower ratio of bs to bhb stars and its different kinematics .",
    "they also suggested that some bhb stars previously attributed to the sgr stream instead properly belong to the cetus stream .    in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : bsstars ] , we display the density distribution of stars on the sky satisfying the color cuts @xmath41 and @xmath42 together with @xmath43 .",
    "the magnitude cut ensures that these stars are primarily bss , and they do indeed align with the sgr stream along @xmath44 ( following the msto distribution showed on the left panel of figure  [ fig : bsstars ] ) .",
    "there is , however , some patchiness in the stellar distribution ; this seems to be associated with granularity in the extinction .",
    "we show the extinction map of @xcite in the right panel of figure  [ fig : bsstars ] , and there is indeed an anomalous patch of high extinction along the path of the stream at @xmath45 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the cetus stars in figure  [ fig : bhbs ] is not easy to understand as the coordinate system is aligned with the sgr orbit . to reconstruct the orientation of cetus",
    ", we first select the bhbs in the range @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we find the direction of the stream by fitting a gaussian to their magnitudes , allowing the center of the gaussian to vary linearly with @xmath24 and @xmath49 .",
    "the fit yields the magnitude of the bhbs as @xmath50 together with the width of the gaussian as @xmath51 mag .",
    "this allows us to refine our selection of cetus candidate members , as shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : bhbstwo ] .",
    "the arrow shows our measured distance gradient of cetus bhbs , which should lie roughly along the extension of the stream . despite low number statistics , the stream is clearly visible and is at significant angle to the sgr stream . to confirm the orientation of the stream ,",
    "the middle panel shows the distance modulus of bhbs as a function of angular distance along the cetus stream .",
    "this angular distance has been derived as longitude in the rotated coordinate system with the pole at @xmath52 and longitude zero - point at @xmath53 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of bhbs have been derived from g@xmath54r colors using eq .",
    "7 of @xcite .",
    "a narrow structure is visible spanning at least @xmath55 .",
    "the measurement of these distances along the structure is given in table  [ tab : cetus_dist ] .",
    "we can further strengthen the case that most of the bhb stars belong to the cetus stream by studying their kinematics .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : bhbstwo ] shows the bs and bhb stars with well measured velocities ( @xmath56 30 kms@xmath17 ) and @xmath57 b @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "the velocity of cetus stars corrected for galactic rotation , @xmath60 @xcite , while the sun s peculiar velocity is taken from @xcite ] is between @xmath54100 and @xmath5450 kms@xmath17 while sgr stars have velocities between @xmath54200 and @xmath54100 kms@xmath17 ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a clear and clean kinematical separation of the bs and bhb stars belonging to sgr and cetus .",
    "given the distance gradient and radial velocity of cetus , we see that its orbital motion is counter - rotating with respect to that of sgr .",
    "we have studied the sagittarius ( sgr ) stream in the southern galactic hemisphere . in the sdss data release 8 , at most locations along the orbit , an additional stream component can be discerned . as evidenced from the density profiles of main sequence turn - off stars and m giants , as well as the tracks of the components on the sky ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : crosssects ] ) , we think that the most natural interpretation is that there are two streams .",
    "our modelling of the cross - sections of the density suggests the existence of a thicker brighter stream and a thinner fainter stream , offset by @xmath61 .",
    "the streams differ in integrated luminosity by a factor of 510 .",
    "there is also strong evidence that the two streams have different metallicity distribution functions .",
    "we used red clump and subgiant stars to measure the distance gradients along the streams .",
    "this enables us to construct composite hess diagrams to study the stellar populations in the streams .",
    "the brighter stream shows evidence for multiple turn - offs and a prominent red clump , whereas the secondary stream does not .",
    "this suggests that the brighter stream is composed of more than one stellar population , and contains a significant number of metal - rich stars , much like the sgr remnant itself .",
    "by contrast , the fainter stream is dominated by a metal - poor population .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by our photometric metallicities computed for the region where the sgr streams cross the ultra - deep sdss stripe 82 coadded data .",
    "our analysis of the new data allows us to untangle a complicated mix of tidal debris around the south galactic cap , where the sgr streams are crossed by the cetus stream at an angle of @xmath62 .",
    "the sgr and cetus streams have similar distances , though their stellar populations and kinematics are different .",
    "the structures are not part of the same disruption event , as the cetus stream is counterrotating with respect to the sgr . on the basis of their density distribution and kinematics , we have shown that most of the bss belong to the sgr stream , whereas most of the bhbs belong to the cetus stream , in this part of the sky .",
    "the bs to bhb ratio in the two streams is strikingly different , as already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "good spectroscopic coverage of the area is essential to disentangle the multiple overlapping streams with different chemical properties , following different distance gradients .",
    "the work in this paper has extended the ` field of streams '  @xcite to the south .",
    "the new imaging data show that , just as in the north , the sgr stream is accompanied by a fainter stream .",
    "the right - hand panel in fig  [ fig : metallicities ] shows that the population mix in the fainter stream of the `` bifurcation '' around the north galactic cap does not contain as many metal - rich stars as the brighter stream .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the southern faint stream is part of the same structure as the northern faint stream .",
    "recently , two possible scenarios , both in context of the sgr dsph disruption , have shown how to form two almost parallel tidal streams from the debris of one parent galaxy .",
    "although @xcite did not fully match the available data , they did suggest that branches a and b ( see @xcite ) could be reproduced by multiple wraps of the same stream offset on the plane of the sky by small amount of differential precession . in this picture , the fainter stream in the north galactic cap area corresponds to the dynamically old tidal debris in the sgr trailing arm .",
    "however , this mechanism does not produce two distinct streams in the south and now seems to be ruled out .    alternatively , @xcite point out that if the sgr progenitor had a rotating stellar disk misaligned with respect to its orbit , then stripping naturally produces bifurcated debris tracks on the sky .",
    "however , the model seems to be ruled out as it has been difficult to find strong evidence for residual rotation in the remnant of the sgr dwarf @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the scenario of @xcite the two streams are not expected to differ significantly in their stellar populations content .",
    "this prediction is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the new data on the stellar populations of the streams . in some other models",
    "although , such as @xcite the streams that form at consecutive pericentric passages could have somewhat different metallicity distributions , as metal - rich stars could have been torn predominantly later , from deeper within the gravitational potential of the satellite .    finally , it is tempting to suggest that the two streams with different properties have actually originated from two different progenitors .",
    "the infall of satellites in groups is not particular but general , as best illustrated by the recent arrival of the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "cosmological simulations of structure formation also find plenty of evidence for group infall ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the picture painted by the data looks more complex than this and remains a challenge to understand .",
    "although there has been substantial progress in modelling the sgr ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it remains true that there is no explanation of the nature of the two sgr streams ."
