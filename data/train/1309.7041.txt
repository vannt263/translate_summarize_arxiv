    "one of the techniques to register ultra - high energy extensive air showers ( eas ) is measuring strength of radio pulse by antennas . unlike traditional techniques , including optic measurements of air shower propagation radio technique can operate in any atmospheric condition except during thunderstorm conditions for whole observation period , which dramatically increases effective time of air showers registration .",
    "it is easier to use and much cheaper than other ground detectors in existing air showers array .    the yakutsk array measured three components of air shower : the total charged component , the muon component and cherenkov radiation . from these components using average lateral distribution function ( ldf ) the integral characteristics of air shower , the total number of charged particles , the total number of muons and full flux of cherenkov light at the sea level are recovered .",
    "all these shower characteristics are used for further model - free air shower energy estimation as shown in [ 1 ] .",
    "cherenkov light registered at the sea level moreover is used to recover air shower longitudinal distribution and it characteristics , cascade curve and depth of maximum x@xmath4 [ 2][3 ] .",
    "using this , in future is possible to find a relation between the characteristics of the radio emission and characteristics of the eas , including slope of the radio emission ldf with depth of maximum , as shown in [ 4 ] .",
    "for the season 2008 - 2012 were recorded 600 air shower events with radio emission .",
    "showers energy were above 3@xmath010@xmath1 ev , and zenith angle @xmath5 @xmath6 70@xmath7 .",
    "for further analysis were selected only 421 showers , appropriate selection criteria of this paper .",
    "therefore , for analysis at the yakutsk array we use following criteria :    1 .",
    "the shower selected if adc prehistory contains radio pulse with amplitude 5 times more than noise level and pulse is localized within time gate equal to delay of `` master '' from small or large arrays . 2 .",
    "extensive air shower axis must be within perimeter of central array with radius 600 m. zenith angle @xmath5 @xmath6 35@xmath7 .",
    "azimuth angle @xmath8 chosen such a way as to exclude influence of polarization effect .",
    "that is , the amplitude of the crossed antennas were equal or were nt go beyond limit ( 3 - 5 ) @xmath9 .        with selected events",
    ", we plotted dependence of maximum amplitude of radio pulse from zenith angle ( fig .",

    "slowly . from equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we derived formula for calculating energy in individual showers :    10@xmath2 ev , 4.38@xmath010@xmath2 ev and 1.32@xmath010@xmath3 ev.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    @xmath15    with : @xmath5 - zenith angle , r - distance of antennas to the shower axis , e@xmath16 - the primary particle energy .    in fig .",
    "@xmath17 dependence of radio emission ldf from depth of the air shower maximum .",
    "the depth was determined by cherenkov detectors measurements of yakutsk array .",
    "the slopes were determined from the ratio of the amplitudes , taken at 80 and 200 m ( fig .",

    "yakutsk array measurements are showing : a ) there is a correlation between measured maximum amplitude of radio signal and air shower energy determined measurements of the main components at observation level .",
