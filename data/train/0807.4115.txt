    "the total and elastic proton - proton cross sections are usually described in terms of an eikonal model @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using an eikonal framework is that it automatically satisfies @xmath8-channel unitarity , which follows once we include the elastic rescattering of the interacting particles .",
    "furthermore , the good - walker formalism @xcite allows the possibility of excited proton states occurring in the intermediate state . in this way",
    "we include low - mass diffractive dissociation .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that a two - channel eikonal is sufficient to capture the main features of this dissociation ( provided , of course , we are not interested in the production of a particular resonant state ) , see also @xcite .    on the other hand , high - mass ( @xmath9 ) diffractive dissociation is described in terms of the triple - regge formalism , where the differential cross section , @xmath10 , is driven by the triple - regge couplings @xmath11 .",
    "the values of these couplings were determined from the data available in triple - regge domain in the 1970s ; see , for example @xcite .",
    "however , these early analyses did not allow for absorptive corrections , which are sizeable in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "therefore , the old triple - regge couplings must be regarded , not as the bare vertices , but as effective couplings embodying absorptive effects .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the original _ bare _ triple - pomeron vertex may be about three times larger than the _ effective _ coupling which is obtained with the neglect of absorptive corrections . however , absorptive effects are very sensitive to the @xmath12-slope of the triple - reggeon vertices and in the 1970s it was `` impossible to determine the exact values of the _ bare _ triple - pomeron coupling '' @xcite ; the accuracy and energy range covered by the data were insufficient .",
    "so the results of the triple - regge analyses were presented in the form of _ effective _ couplings .",
    "this leads to a problem , since the absorptive effects are not constant factors , but depend on the energy and the type of diffractive process .",
    "since the inelastic cross section expected at the lhc is more than twice as large as that observed at fixed target and cern - isr energies , we can not use the results of the old triple - regge analyses to predict the diffractive effects at the lhc .",
    "it is therefore necessary to perform a new triple - regge analysis that includes the absorptive effects explicitly . here",
    "we present the first analysis of the available diffractive ( and elastic ) data in the cern - isr  tevatron region in which the absorptive corrections are systematically included .",
    "the absorptive corrections are calculated in terms of a two - channel eikonal model fitted to describe the total and elastic differential cross section data for @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering .    at the moment ,",
    "the energy behaviour of the scattering amplitude may be consistently described by two different scenarios for the asymptotic regime @xcite .",
    "one is called the _ weak coupling _ of the pomerons . in this case , at very high energy , the cross sections tend to the universal constant value _ tot  as  s . in order not to violate unitarity ,",
    "the triple - pomeron coupling must vanish with vanishing transverse momentum transferred through the pomeron @xcite g_3p   q^2_t  as  q_t 0 .",
    "[ eq : weak ] another possibility is called the _ strong coupling _",
    "scenario @xcite . here , at a very high energies , the cross sections grows as _",
    "tot^  with   0<2 , and the bare vertex g_3p|_q_t 0  constant .",
    "[ eq : strong ]    the present data are usually described within the froissart - like limit of the second scenario ( with @xmath13 ) .",
    "however to reach asymptotics we need * very * high energy  the energy at which the slope of the elastic amplitude , @xmath14 is dominated by the second term , that is when @xmath15 .",
    "this is far beyond the energies available at present .",
    "another possibility , to distinguish between the _ weak _ and _ strong _ approaches , is to study the @xmath16 dependence of the bare triple - pomeron vertex .",
    "thus , it is important to extract the _ bare _ vertex before its behaviour is affected by absorptive corrections .",
    "this paper is devoted to a detailed analysis of `` soft '' scattering data using , in turn , the _ strong _ and _ weak _ triple - pomeron coupling behaviours . in section 2",
    "we recall the good - walker formalism for the two - channel eikonal model , in section 3 we briefly describe the parametrisation used to calculate the absorptive corrections for the triple - reggeon cross sections and demonstrate that this parametrisation is consistent with the available data on the differential elastic ( @xmath17 ) and total cross sections .",
    "next , in section 4 , we give the formulae for the inclusive cross section , @xmath18 , in the triple - regge region which incorporates the screening corrections caused by the two - channel eikonal .",
    "the results of our triple - regge analyses of @xmath19 and @xmath20 data are presented in section 5 .",
    "we perform fits using both the strong and weak triple - pomeron coupling .",
    "we find that the data favour the former ansatz . in section 6",
    "we discuss the description of the data for inelastic diffractive @xmath21 photoproduction , @xmath22 , obtained at hera .",
    "we find that the @xmath21 hera data again favour the strong triple - pomeron coupling scenario . in section 7",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "first , we briefly recall the relevant features of the single - channel eikonal model .",
    "that is we focus on elastic unitarity .",
    "then `` disc @xmath23 '' is simply the discontinuity of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude @xmath23 across the two - particle @xmath8-channel cut . at high energies we have a sizeable inelastic component .",
    "the @xmath8-channel unitarity relation is diagonal in the impact parameter , @xmath24 , basis , and may be written 2 imt_el(s , b ) = |t_el(s , b)|^2 + g_inel(s , b ) [ eq : a1 ] with _ tot & = & 2d^2b imt_el(s , b ) [ eq : ot ] + _ el & = & d^2b|t_el(s , b)|^2 + _ inel & = & d^2b .",

    "it has an important effect on the local slope , @xmath49 , of the elastic cross section .",
    "for the results that we obtain below for the pomeron trajectory , @xmath50 , it is important to note that expression ( [ eq : a10 ] ) for @xmath48 has been renormalised @xcite , such that [ eq : b10 ] h ( ) = h _ ( ) - h_(0 ) where @xmath51 denotes the full pion - loop contribution",

    "finally , the total opacity is given by the sum of all the allowed regge exchanges  =  _ i = p , r_i .    in the present simplified analysis we neglect the real part of the amplitude , since our goal is to investigate the role of the absorptive effect which is caused essentially by the imaginary part of the amplitude , that is by the real part of the opacity .",

    "each hadronic constituent can undergo scattering and thus destroy the coherence of the fluctuations . as a consequence",
    ", the outgoing superposition of states will be different from the incident particle , and will most likely contain multiparticle states , so we will have _ inelastic _ , as well as elastic , diffraction .    to discuss inelastic diffraction , it is convenient to follow good and walker  @xcite , and to introduce states @xmath55 which diagonalize the @xmath23 matrix .",

    "the problem is that , at present , the @xmath126 dependence of the cross section has not been measured ; only the value integrated over an @xmath126 interval is given .",
    "the large value of the triple - pomeron coupling that was extracted in @xcite assumed that the whole cross section originates from pomeron exchange , and neglected the secondary reggeon contribution .",
    "here we have included the secondary reggeon contribution .",
    "however , if the @xmath126 distribution were to be observed , it would then be possible to separate these contributions using just the @xmath21 photoproduction data , and to give an independent check of the results of our triple - regge analysis",
    ". clearly a dedicated measurement of the process @xmath3 , including especially the @xmath125 and @xmath12 dependence , would be extremely informative .",
    "we have performed a triple - regge analysis of the available @xmath144 and @xmath145 data , in which we account for absorptive effects .",
    "thus , the couplings of the triple - reggeon vertices extracted in this analysis will be much closer to the couplings of the original _ bare _ vertices than those obtained in the old analyses , where the screening corrections were implicitly included in the values of _ effective _ couplings .",
    "the triple - pomeron vertex turns out to be rather large , @xmath146 .",
    "this indicates that , in a more precise description of `` soft '' interactions , we must include more complicated enhanced diagrams and diagrams with the multi - pomeron vertices ( that is with a larger number of pomerons in a vertex ) .",
    "due to the inclusion of the high - energy tevatron data in the analysis , we now obtain a twice larger relative contribution of the @xmath120 term in comparison with the results of the old analyses .",
    "we considered two possible parametrisations of the small @xmath16 behaviour of the triple - pomeron vertex : g_3p = constant   and  g_3p = g^w_3p(0)q^2_texp(-bq^2_t ) , in gev units .",
    "we found that the data prefer the first , the so - called _ strong _ pomeron coupling scenario . in the second , the so - called _ weak _ coupling , case",
    ", we obtained a much poorer description of the high - energy tevatron ( cdf ) data at small @xmath102 and low @xmath147 gev@xmath148 , where the triple - pomeron contribution dominates .",
    "it will be important to measure the inclusive cross section for single diffraction , @xmath99 , at the lhc to confirm this conclusion .",
    "this could be done when the forward detectors are operating at the lhc , even at moderate integrated luminosity @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to study in more detail @xmath21 diffractive production with dissociation of the target proton .",
    "that is , to measure the @xmath149 and @xmath12 dependence of the @xmath150 reaction .",
    "the hera experiments have so far only presented the cross section integrated over @xmath149 up to @xmath151 gev .",
    "however , already these data support the _ strong _ coupling solution .",
    "finally , we note that our analysis of the data prefers zero slopes , corresponding to small size of the bare triple - reggeon vertices . together with the larger values of the @xmath110 and @xmath120 vertices",
    ", this gives hope that there is a smooth matching to the perturbative qcd treatment of the pomeron .",
