    "in a recent paper , balbus ( 2009 , hereafter b09 ) argued that the shape of the isorotation contours in the solar convection zone ( scz ) may be understood as a consequence of a dominant thermal wind balance in the vorticity equation , together with the near coincidence of surfaces of constant specific entropy @xmath0 ( isentropes ) and surfaces of constant angular velocity @xmath1 ( isotachs ) . with @xmath0 a function of @xmath1 , the thermal wind equation ( twe )",
    "may be solved analytically and exactly ; the isorotation contours then explicitly correspond to the characteristics of the twe .",
    "b09 found that the agreement between the characteristics and the observed @xmath1 profile is very good , even under the simplest of assumptions . in this paper , we take a more systematic approach , and find that the agreement is truly remarkable ( cf .",
    "figure [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the quality of the fit is strong evidence not only that thermal wind balance holds in the bulk of the solar convection zone ( as noted previously in many numerical simulations ) , but that there is also some functional relationship between entropy and angular rotation that needs to be understood .",
    "the hope , of course , is that this is telling us something important about the physics of the solar convection zone .",
    "b09 puts forth the case that the scz is in a state of marginal dynamic instability not only against convective instabilities , but against magneto - baroclinic instabilities . to understand why the distinction is important , recall that a weak magnetic field in a differentially rotating gas is a catalyst for destabilization",
    "this effect is well known to the accretion disk community in the form of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , which renders fully turbulent what would otherwise be hydrodynamically stable keplerian disks .",
    "b09 argues that in its magnetobaroclinic guise , this weak field instability can destabilize what would be hydrodynamically stable stratified configurations of the scz , driving the system to a condition of marginal instability .",
    "such a state is reached when constant entropy surfaces and constant angular velocity surfaces nearly coincide , leading to an @xmath2 relationship .    in this paper",
    ", we examine another possible explanation for the striking fit evidenced by figure [ 1 ] in  2 .",
    "we are motivated , in part , by the fact that some purely hydrodynamic calculations are able to reproduce rather well certain noncylindrical features of the solar rotation profile ( miesch , brun , & toomre 2006 , hereafter mbt06 ; miesch et al .",
    "2008 ; miesch & toomre 2009 ) .",
    "those runs show that , provided there are sufficiently large latitudinal entropy gradients at the base of the scz , a very plausible fit to the solar isorotational contours can be found throughout the bulk of this region . in this current paper , we will argue that there may well be a generic hydrodynamical mechanism that explains both the observed helioseismology results and the numerical simulations .",
    "an outline of our paper is as follows . in  2 , we present an improved fit between an explicit solution of the thermal wind equation and the helioseismology data",
    ". we also introduce , following mbt06 , the concept of `` residual entropy '' : the average entropy profile remaining after an underlying radial profile has been removed .",
    "arguments are presented which suggest that convecting fluid elements will tend to move in surfaces of constant residual entropy . in  3 , we further argue that the same fluid elements will also tend to move in surfaces of constant angular velocity , and that these surfaces must therefore coincide with those of residual entropy .",
    "the coincidence of surfaces of residual entropy and angular velocity is necessary in our approach to obtain a solution of the thermal wind equation . in ",
    "4 we conclude with an evaluation and discussion of the relative merits of the hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical approaches .",
    "let @xmath3 be a standard cylindrical coordinate system , and @xmath4 a standard spherical coordinate system .",
    "we consider an equilibrium flow in a state of azimuthal rotation in which the angular velocity @xmath1 is assumed to be independent of @xmath5 , but may depend upon @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the background entropy profile @xmath0 is also a function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "our notation for the other fluid variables is standard : @xmath8 is the velocity , @xmath9 is the gas pressure , and @xmath10 is the mass density . unless otherwise stated , all thermodynamic variables are understood to be @xmath5 independent azimuthal averages .",
    "the velocity @xmath8 will in general contain ( convective ) fluctuating components ; any azimuthal averaging will be treated explicitly .",
    "the scz gravitational field @xmath11 is to a good approximation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the product of the newtonian gravitational constant and a solar mass .",
    "finally , we define a dimensionless entropy function @xmath14 : p^- , where @xmath15 is the adiabatic index .",
    "the thermodynamic entropy is then given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the specific heat at constant pressure .",
    "our starting point is the partial differential equation arising from the assumption of a dominant thermal wind balance in the time averaged ( and thus azimuthally averaged ) vorticity equation ( e.g. kitchatinov & rdiger 1995 , thompson et al .",
    "2003 , miesch 2005 , b09 ) : [ twe ] r ^2z = gr if , for some reason , there is a functional relationship of the form @xmath18 ( the sign of @xmath1 presumably does not matter ) , then the twe may be written in spherical coordinates as [ maineq ] ^2r - ( g f r^2 + r ) ^2 = 0 , where @xmath19 .",
    "notice , however , that exactly the same equation obtains if the functional relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath1 takes the more general form [ gauge ] -_r = f(^2 ) , where @xmath20 will be referred to as residual entropy , and @xmath21 is any function of @xmath22 alone .",
    "we will make important use or this `` gauge freedom '' later in this paper .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ maineq ] ) is that @xmath23 is constant along the characteristic contours ( b09 ) : r^2=r^2 ^ 2= a -br , where @xmath24 is a constant of integration , and b= - 2gm_f(^2 ) .",
    "if we denote by the subscript ` 0 ' the fiducial starting point of the characteristic ( at which @xmath1 is specified ) , then the contour takes the form [ chars ] r^2=r^2 ^ 2= r_0 ^ 2 ^2_0- b ( 1r- 1r_0 )    while @xmath25 is a constant along a given characteristic , its value can change from one characteristic to another depending upon the form of the function @xmath26 .",
    "b09 showed , however , that the simplest parameterizations of @xmath26 ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath27 a global constant or @xmath27 a linear function of @xmath28 ) already give excellent qualitative fits to the helioseismology data .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to do even better .",
    "figure [ 1 ] shows a comparison between isorotational contours ( in black ) from recent gong data and the characteristics of the thermal wind equation ( overlayed in white ) . here ,",
    "we have carried out a more systematic approach than that of b09 : we have integrated each characteristic from an _ interior _ starting point of @xmath29 solar radii ( as opposed to the less accurate surface fitting in b09 ) , and chosen the constant @xmath25 to match the initial slope of the data at the fitting radius .",
    "the new result is remarkably accurate , not just in qualitative form , but in quantitative detail as well .",
    "expected departures of the black and white contours in the surface layers and tachocline are plainly visible , yet in the bulk of the scz the match is excellent .",
    "note the equator and poles , where the curvature of the contours is , perhaps surprisingly , reproduced with great precision . while this _ is _ evidence of the validity of thermal wind balance , the implied functional relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath14 ( or @xmath20 ) is also at least partly a consequence of mathematical symmetry . in the polar neighborhoods @xmath6 gradients are small , and near the equator @xmath7 gradients are small , so that in both regions azimuthally averaged flow quantities will be a function predominantly of spherical @xmath22 .",
    "these quantities must therefore be functionally related .",
    "this functional relationship evidently extends seamlessly into the regions immediately adjacent to the symmetry points , in which the isocontours are not predominantly radial .",
    "one possible explanation for the striking resemblance of the analytic isorotation contours to the solar data was advanced in b09 by invoking a weak magnetic field . in the presence of such a field ,",
    "disturbances associated with magnetobaroclinic modes lead to a condition of marginal instability if @xmath18 .",
    "this is a _ dynamical _ connection between @xmath14 and @xmath1 , indeed an mhd connection .",
    "we will review the merits and shortcomings of this scenario in more detail in  4 . here , we explore a more general connection between @xmath14 and @xmath1 relying neither upon magnetic fields , nor even upon dynamical constraints .",
    "the idea relies instead on the gauge freedom expressed in equation ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "consider a fiducial , nonrotating , spherical , convecting star that maintains a well - defined , long - term average radial entropy profile @xmath21 .",
    "convection continously mixes high and low entropy fluid elements , yet @xmath21 remains fixed .",
    "the reason for this is not mysterious .",
    "the system is heated from below , and this input tries to drive the gas into a state with a considerably steeper entropy profile .",
    "convection counters this , allowing a balance to be struck between the external thermal driving and the heat transport by turbulent fluid elements .",
    "in particular , convective displacements do not need to be within constant entropy surfaces to preserve the long - term @xmath21 profile .",
    "this profile is already being maintained by the external heating .",
    "if we now introduce a small amount of rotation into the problem , we expect coriolis forces to produce a more complex , but still well - defined , long - term entropy profile , @xmath30 .",
    "as before , convection will try its very best to change this profile .",
    "however , in contrast to the spherical case of the previous paragraph , it is very far from clear that radial heating from below can maintain a steady , nonspherical entropy profile .",
    "on the other hand , if the convective velocities @xmath8 on average satisfy the constraint [ conconst ]  = 0 then the entropy profile certainly _ can _ be maintained . in this case , the long term maintenance of the spherically averaged component of the entropy @xmath21 is assured by heating from below , while the residual entropy @xmath20 is preserved because convective displacements will tend on average to occur in surfaces in which this quantity is constant .",
    "thus , the long - term average entropy profile @xmath30 remains intact .",
    "convecting elements move not in constant entropy surfaces ( which would preclude heat transport ! ) , but in surfaces of constant _ residual _ entropy @xmath20 .",
    "some care is needed for the proper interpretation of equation ( [ conconst ] ) .",
    "the poloidal components of @xmath8 ( hereafter @xmath31 ) have a long term average value much smaller than a typical fluctuation amplitude @xmath32 .",
    "( this systematic velocity manifests itself principally as the meridional flow that has been measured at , and near , the surface . )",
    "a time average of equation ( [ conconst ] ) would produce contributions of second order in the fluctuations , including heretofore neglected @xmath20 fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that the `` up - down '' convective velocity fluctuations nearly cancel means that for a given convective cell , there is very little to distinguish these two directions .",
    "( because of rotation , `` upward '' and `` downward '' need not be precisely radial , of course . )",
    "these first order velocity fluctuations in essence establish a well - defined axis relative to which @xmath33 is orthogonal ; the positive and negative sense of the axis is unimportant .",
    "a more precise formulation of equation ( [ conconst ] ) is therefore ( )^2 | ^2| | |^2where the angle brackets @xmath34 denote time averaging .",
    "this is also a more robust formulation , since the quantity on the left is now dominated by the first order velocity contribution @xmath31 , and fluctuations in @xmath20 do not enter .",
    "more physically , simulations and laboratory experiments suggest that convective transport is dominated by long - lived coherent structures .",
    "the updrafts and downward plumes characteristic of these structures are clearly associated with dominant `` first order '' velocity terms , and it is these structures that would exist within and maintain constant @xmath20 surfaces . if it could now be further argued that convecting fluid elements ( or coherent structures ) also lie within constant @xmath1 surfaces , we would arrive at an understanding of why there is a functional relation between @xmath1 and @xmath20 : if elements are simultaneously moving in @xmath35 surfaces of constant @xmath1 and @xmath20 , these must be the same surfaces .",
    "in other words , the two quantities are functionally related . in the next section",
    ", we will see that there is indeed a simple argument leading to the conclusion that displaced fluid elements will inevitably move in constant @xmath1 surfaces .",
    "finally , we reiterate that although the original b09 derivation of the isorotation contours was based on the assumption that @xmath18 , exactly the same contours emerge if the functional relation is @xmath36 .",
    "this very simple gauge invariance of the thermal wind equation allows for a considerably wider , more general class of thermal wind solutions , eliminating the constraint that constant ( total ) entropy and angular velocity surfaces coincide .",
    "support for the line of argument advanced in the previous section can be found in the ( purely hydrodynamical ) mbt06 simulations . in these runs ,",
    "the residual entropy @xmath20 is calculated relative to a background radial profile , corresponding to our @xmath21 . in figure",
    "[ 2 ] , we show time averaged contours of the angular velocity profile @xmath1 from the mbt06 run designated ab3 , of the residual entropy , and of the total entropy @xmath14 .",
    "the agreement between the @xmath1 and @xmath20 contours is apparent , as is the gross disagreement between @xmath1 and @xmath14 .",
    "evidently , there is a functional relation between @xmath20 and @xmath1 , whereas there is no such relation between @xmath1 and @xmath14 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the above discussion .",
    "notice as well the small gradient of @xmath20 near the equator .",
    "this is as expected if @xmath21 represents an angular average of @xmath14 , which would be dominated by @xmath37 values near @xmath38 .",
    "consider the behavior of convective disturbances in a differentially rotating gas @xmath39 .",
    "the disturbances are embedded in this shearing medium , and since they are not propagated as waves , we may think of them as local in character .",
    "but `` local '' refers to the shearing gas , not to an absolute space - time grid , so it is particularly useful to express flow quantities in lagrangian coordinates tied to the shear flow .",
    "we designate these coordinates as the `` primed '' system .",
    "this transformation is given by r=r , ",
    "= -(r , z ) t , z=z , t=t .    for our present purposes ,",
    "we need consider only the equation of mass conservation : ( ) = 0 , where @xmath8 is understood to be the velocity relative to the differential rotation @xmath40 .",
    "the gradients are of course the standard eulerian derivatives taken at fixed time .",
    "we have not written the explicit @xmath10 time derivative , since we are ultimately interested in long term time averaging and the term will disappear . apart from this , the equation is exact ; the mass flux is taken to have a full space time dependence .    transforming to our comoving system , =  r",
    "-t r   , =  z -t z   , and the @xmath5 derivative is unchanged .",
    "more compactly , = ",
    "-(t )   , a relation that holds for all three components .",
    "the embedded mass flux field @xmath41 may be expressed as a superposition of fourier components of the form in which all components of the @xmath42 wave vector are constants .",
    "the above coordinate transformation implies that in the mass conservation equation , the standard eulerian spatial derivatives with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 are replaced respectively by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where k_r(t ) = k_r -mtr ,",
    "k_z(t ) = k_z -mtz henceforth , the time dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 will be understood .",
    "a somewhat similar formalism has been developed for embedded disturbances in shear turbulence , where it is known as _ rapid distortion theory _ (",
    "townsend 1980 ) .",
    "the fourier series for the mass flux is : = ( , ) , where @xmath47 is the amplitude of the indicated wavenumber and frequency .",
    "mass conservation leads immediately to 0= ( ) = ( , ) .",
    "each fourier term is linearly independent of the others , hence for all @xmath42 , @xmath48 , ( -mt ) ( , ) = 0 for nonvanishing @xmath49 , at sufficiently large @xmath50 , ( , ) = 0 .",
    "the mass flux is a superposition of the @xmath51 vectors .",
    "therefore , if the flux is not dominated by an @xmath52 component , it will tend toward surfaces of constant @xmath1 .",
    "note that this statement is restricted neither to linearized displacements , nor to the wkb limit .",
    "finally , it has been noted that this tendency for turbulent convective structures to align with constant @xmath1 surfaces may also be supported on a dynamical basis via the effects of the coriolis force on plumes ( brummell , hurlburt , & toomre 1996 ) .",
    "alignment of embedded structures with constant @xmath1 surfaces is of course seen regularly in accretion disk simulations , where the shear is large and depends only upon @xmath6 .",
    "disks features often appear nearly axisymmetric because of the effect of the shear . in the sun",
    ", the @xmath6 and @xmath7 dependence of @xmath1 leads to a more structured response .",
    "this assumes , of course , that the rotational shear is strong enough to interact with the convective cells over the course of their lifetime .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for the sun , especially if the convection is dominated by long - lived coherent stuctures .",
    "this , in principle , supplies the missing link of the argument of  2.2.1 : the course of a displaced mass element will tend on average to follow a constant @xmath1 surface , essentially because differential rotation wraps the flow into sheets of constant @xmath1 .",
    "since fluid elements move at once in surfaces of constant @xmath1 and constant @xmath20 , these surfaces must in general coincide .",
    "notice how the complete set of three hydrodynamical equations  mass conservation , entropy conservation , and the equation of motion  has been incorporated in our solution . from mass conservation",
    ", we infer that fluid elements move in constant @xmath1 surfaces . from entropy conservation",
    ", we infer that fluid elements move in surfaces of constant @xmath20 . from these two inferences",
    ", it follows that constant @xmath1 and constant @xmath20 surfaces coincide , and this , expressed as a functional dependence , is used in the equation of motion ( thermal wind balance ) to construct the isorotational contours of figure [ 1 ] .",
    "the convective heat transport is w , where @xmath53 represents the difference between the specific enthalpy of a convecting element and its surroundings .",
    "the reasoning we used in the last section shows that [ qq ] 0 , as time progresses . in other words , the heat flux , like the mass flux ,",
    "is predominantly in surfaces of constant @xmath1 .",
    "this offers a very plausible physical basis for what has long been regarded as a puzzling issue : why are the solar rotation contours quasi - radial ?",
    "the answer we suggest is that the rotation contours are also the natural conduits for convective heat transport , and their near radial character simply reflects this property .",
    "the contours represent a compromise between strong radial thermal driving and the dynamical exigencies embodied in the twe .",
    "thus , they are nearly , but not perfectly , radial throughout the bulk of the scz . near the equator and poles , the convective heat flow certainly does _ not _ follow isorotation contours , but as has already been noted in  2.1.1 , these are precisely the regions in which the functional relationship between @xmath20 and @xmath1 is maintained by mathematical symmetry .",
    "it is interesting to speculate on how the isorotation contours would change in rapidly rotating stars .",
    "for example , when a solar - type star first arrives on the main sequence it spins much more rapidly than the sun does now .",
    "the convection pattern is likely to be dominated by coriolis effects , expressed through the taylor - proudman constraint ( busse & simitev 2007 ) .",
    "numerical models confirm that convection takes the form of elongated `` banana cells '' at low latitudes , outside the tangent cylinder that encloses the radiative zone ( ballot , brun & turck - chize 2007 ; brown et al .",
    "in these rapidly rotating stars , the isotachs tend to be roughly cylindrical and there are pole - equator differences in entropy and temperature that are significantly larger than those inferred for the sun . in our model , the @xmath54 scaling of @xmath55 suggests a much smaller value for the @xmath25 parameter in rapid rotators , which does indeed lead to more cylindrical isotachs .",
    "what is novel about our approach is not the use of the thermal wind equation _ per se , _ which has provided important guidance to workers in this field for many years now .",
    "it is the suggestion that there is a functional relationship between the entropy and angular velocity , for it is this that allows an analytic deduction of the shape of the sun s isorotation contours to be made directly from the twe .    as a formal matter",
    ", there is some freedom in choosing the precise form of the entropy  angular velocity relation , a type of gauge invariance .",
    "this is because the twe involves only the @xmath37 derivative of the entropy and the @xmath7 derivative of the angular velocity .",
    "different physical mechanisms for coupling @xmath14 and @xmath1 in principle entail a different choice of gauge .    in b09",
    ", an mhd process was invoked to couple @xmath14 and @xmath1 . that paper noted that baroclinic modes in a weakly magnetized gas become marginally unstable if constant @xmath14 and constant @xmath1 surfaces coincide , i.e. @xmath56 . in that approach , rotation and stratification",
    "are set on an equal footing in determining the dynamical stability of the sun s outer layers .",
    "moreover , in the mhd model , the radial entropy gradient is restricted to be significantly less than the @xmath37 gradient .",
    "this can be readily deduced from figure [ 1 ] , since in the @xmath18 interpretation , the gong data curves are isentropes as well as isorotation contours . whether the actual radial entropy gradient is constrained in this way depends upon the scale of the effective mixing length .",
    "if this length is only a small fraction of the radial extent of the convection zone , the radial entropy gradient could significantly exceed the @xmath37 gradient .",
    "finally , in the mhd model , the goodness of the fit between the theoretical and observed isorotation contours depends upon a very tight functional relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath1 . but were the @xmath14 and @xmath1 surfaces to coincide @xmath57 , convection would be completely cut - off .",
    "conversely , as we have noted above , if very vigorous convection is required , it becomes untenable to maintain a @xmath18 relation .",
    "is the departure between @xmath58 and @xmath59 large enough to allow for vigorous convection , yet small enough to ensure that @xmath18 remains an excellent approximation in the twe ?",
    "the purely hydrodynamical explanation for the solar isorotation contours avoids many of these potential difficulties .",
    "the restriction on the size of the radial entropy gradient is lifted by seeking a functional relationship of the form of equation ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "as the residual entropy @xmath20 can be significantly smaller than @xmath14 , the effects of a potentially large radial entropy gradient can be eliminated from the rotational dynamics of the problem .",
    "the physical basis for this functional form is related to the fact that convection should occur on average in surfaces of constant @xmath20 , so as to maintain a well - defined time averaged @xmath14 ( total entropy ) profile .",
    "the kinematics of differential rotation and simple mass conservation ultimately confine mass motions to surfaces of constant @xmath1 .",
    "together with equation ( [ conconst ] ) , this ensures a relationship of the form @xmath36 , and even suggests why the contours are quasi - radial ( cf .",
    "[ [ qq ] ] ) . without the need to restrict @xmath60",
    ", convection can be as vigorous as needed ( provided that it does not dominate the differential rotation ) , yet not directly affect the twe solution for the isorotation contours .    finally , the `` hydrodynamical '' argument can easily accommodate mhd processes . neither mass conservation nor entropy conservation , the two physical processes central to our argument , change in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the dynamical details , in particular the rotational couplings , may well be altered , but the functional relation between @xmath20 and @xmath1 should remain robust .",
    "we therefore suggest that the simple physical arguments leading to equation ( [ gauge ] ) may prove to be a suitable basis for understanding much of the dynamics that gives rise to the solar isorotation contours .    the theory outlined in this paper",
    "is meant to be a viable alternative to an mhd model , and it is as yet far from complete .",
    "our presentation falls well short of the standards of mathematical proof .",
    "we have relied on `` tendencies '' for the fluid to move in surfaces of constant @xmath1 and @xmath20 to be strong enough to firmly establish the relationship expressed compactly by equation ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "but figure [ 1 ] speaks for itself .",
    "to understand at a deeper level why this approach seems to work so well , a more detailed elucidation of the dynamics is clearly desirable .    to conclude , in this paper we have advanced theoretical arguments to explain the striking correspondence between isentropes and isotachs in azimuthally averaged models of the solar convection zone .",
    "these arguments need to be backed up by directed and detailed computations . to this end",
    ", we are currently developing an anelastic code that can be used to demonstrate explicitly that the relationship of equation ( [ gauge ] ) is valid for a variety of relevant configurations .",
    "our principal aim will be to explore the connection between @xmath1 and @xmath14 ( or @xmath20 ) as the overall rotation rate is varied .",
    "the effects on this relationship of varying the thermal boundary conditions , in order to represent the influence of the solar tachocline ( miesch & toomre 2009 ) , are also of great interest .",
