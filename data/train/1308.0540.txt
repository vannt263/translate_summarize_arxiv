    "after the recent discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite the lhc s next foremost goal is to find evidence for physics beyond the standard model , i.e. , new particles or forces . with a center - of - mass energy of 13  tev , starting in spring 2015 , the lhc experiments can access an unprecedented energy regime , allowing for the production of very heavy resonances .",
    "when heavy tev - scale resonances decay to electroweak - scale particles ( e.g. , top quarks , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and higgs bosons ) , these particles are boosted , and for central production , the particle s transverse momentum @xmath6 exceeds its mass @xmath7 . the decay products of these particles are then collimated in the laboratory frame . due to the large branching ratio of electroweak - scale resonances into jets , it is beneficial , in many measurements and searches , to use jet substructure methods to disentangle the signal from large qcd backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of intermediately ( @xmath8 ) and highly ( @xmath9 ) boosted top quarks was one of the first motivations to study jet substructure techniques  @xcite . for an overview of these so - called ` top - taggers ' see  @xcite .",
    "of the two closest quarks in the top quark decay @xmath0 as a function of the top quark @xmath10.,width=288 ]    some of the most successful taggers are either based on jet - shape observables  @xcite or on sophisticated ways of selecting subjets inside a fat jet and comparing their energy sharing  @xcite .",
    "the separate identification of the decay products of highly boosted top quarks becomes experimentally challenging when the detector granularity does not allow to resolve the individual particle jets .",
    "this is particularly an issue if jets are reconstructed using calorimeter information alone as it is currently done with atlas data .",
    "the cell size of the atlas barrel hadronic calorimeter is @xmath11 in @xmath12 and topological cell clusters are formed around seed cells with an energy @xmath13 by adding the neighboring cells with @xmath14 , and then all surrounding cells  @xcite .",
    "the minimal transverse size for a cluster of hadronic calorimeter cells is therefore @xmath15 and is reached if all significant activity is concentrated in one cell .",
    "two particle jets leave distinguishable clusters if each jet hits only a single cell and the jet axes are separated by at least @xmath16 , so that there is one empty cell between the two seed cells .",
    "if two top quark decay jets are so close that they do not leave separate clusters then top taggers based on identifying the 3-prong decay structure will fail . figure  [ fig : minseparation ] shows the angular separation @xmath17 of the two closest final state quarks in hadronic top quark decay @xmath0 as a function of the top quark @xmath10 . for @xmath18  tev",
    "the separation is @xmath19 and calorimeter resolution issues should become apparent around that @xmath10or even earlier if the particle level jets that correspond to the quarks are not collimated enough to hit only a single cell .",
    "a precise determination of the threshold top quark @xmath10requires the use of the atlas simulation framework and hence has to be carried out by the atlas collaboration .",
    "tracking detectors that measure the trajectories of charged particles can remedy the problem because of the much finer spatial resolution . in this article",
    ", we therefore propose a novel method of reconstructing highly boosted top quarks using a combination of tracks and calorimeter information .",
    "we compare the tagging efficiency of this high-@xmath10top tagger ( hpttoptagger ) with the heptoptagger  @xcite and show that , with the hpttoptagger , the lhc has a discovery reach for heavy resonances , which decay exclusively into top quarks , up to a resonance mass of 3  tev with @xmath20  fb@xmath3 of data taken at @xmath21  tev .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : in section  [ sec : toptag ] we introduce the top - tagging algorithm of the hpttoptagger . in section  [ sec : perf ] we compare the tagging performance of the hpttoptaggerwith that of the heptoptaggerfor highly boosted top quarks . we present the reach of the lhc in discovering very heavy resonances in section  [ sec : res ] and summarize our findings in section  [ sec : outlook ] .",
    "the heptoptaggeruses a mass - drop criterion and adaptive filtering to obtain three subjets that are tested for kinematic compatibility with hadronic top quark decay .",
    "these conditions are formulated in the form of ratios of invariant mass combinations of the subjets .",
    "for example , the mass @xmath22 is defined as the invariant mass of the subleading @xmath10and the sub - subleading @xmath10subjet . for most hadronic top",
    "quark decays , the ratio @xmath23 corresponds to @xmath24 with the @xmath25-jet having the largest @xmath10 .",
    "the invariant masses are determined from the 4-momenta of the subjets which have to be reconstructed precisely .",
    "the atlas collaboration has calculated calibration constants for the heptoptaggersubjets and uncertainties that quantify to which precision the subjet energy scale and energy resolution can be modeled in simulation  @xcite .",
    "these uncertainties are crucial for comparing the data to simulated model predictions and for setting exclusion limits as has been done for example in  @xcite",
    ". calibrations of atlas cambridge / aachen ( @xmath26 ) jets  @xcite are available for radius parameters @xmath27 from 1.2 down to 0.2  @xcite .",
    "jets with a smaller radius parameter approach the minimal hadronic cluster size as discussed in section  [ sec : case ] .",
    "a tracking detector can reconstruct the trajectory of a charged particle and can specify the direction of the particle at any point of the trajectory with a precision much better than the granularity of the calorimeter .",
    "for example , the angular resolution of the atlas inner tracking detector for charged particles with @xmath28  gev and @xmath29 is @xmath30 in @xmath31 and @xmath32  mrad in @xmath33  @xcite with a reconstruction efficiency of @xmath34 for tracks of charged particles with @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the momentum resolution for charged pions is @xmath36 for momenta @xmath37  gev , rising to @xmath38 at @xmath39  gev  @xcite .",
    "prong - based tagging algorithms usually require the reconstruction of the top quark and @xmath4boson masses to identify a fat jet as being initiated by a top quark decay . in a typical proton - proton collision , about @xmath40 of the jet energy is carried by charged hadrons , @xmath41 by photons , produced mainly from @xmath42 decays , and only @xmath43 by neutral hadrons ( mostly neutrons and @xmath44 )  @xcite .",
    "however , these fractions can vary significantly from event to event .",
    "thus , reconstructing the correct resonance mass is a challenging task for a tagging algorithm which is based exclusively on tracks .",
    "fortunately , while no calibrations exist for subjets with @xmath45 , the energy of the fat jet can be calibrated to good precision  @xcite and the inverse of the energy fraction carried by charged tracks    @xmath46    can be measured for each jet individually , thereby eliminating the sensitivity to fluctuations to a large extend .",
    "our tagger for highly boosted top quarks uses elements of the heptoptaggerwhich do not introduce artificial mass scales in background events , i.e. , we do not consider all possible three subjet combinations until we find a top - like structure .",
    "such drastic measures might be necessary when the small boost of the top quark requires to use a very large jet cone to capture all decay products . in the case of a highly boosted top quark",
    ", the decay products are confined to a small area of the detector and the amount of additional radiation inside a @xmath26jet with @xmath47 is usually not excessive .",
    "to reconstruct highly boosted top quarks we propose the following procedure , labeled for later reference as hpttoptagger algorithm :    1 .",
    "define a jet @xmath48 using the c / a algorithm with @xmath47 from calorimeter clusters .",
    "[ step2 ] take the tracks with @xmath49  mev that are associated with @xmath48 and recombine them to a track - based jet @xmath50 .",
    "3 .   calculate @xmath51 of equation  ( [ eq : alpha ] ) using @xmath48 and @xmath50 .",
    "4 .   apply the mass drop procedure introduced in @xcite : undo the last clustering of the track - based jet @xmath50 into two subjets @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "we require @xmath54 to keep @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "if this condition does not hold we keep only @xmath55 .",
    "each subjet @xmath57 we further decompose unless @xmath58 .",
    "the remaining subjets we add to the list of relevant substructures . 5 .",
    "if we find fewer than two remaining subjets we consider the tag to have failed .",
    "else , we take the constituents of all subjets surviving the mass drop procedure and multiply their momenta by @xmath51 each .",
    "[ step6 ] we take all the rescaled constituents and filter them with resolution @xmath59 , in which @xmath60 and @xmath48 run over all remaining subjets after the mass drop procedure .",
    "we recombine all constituents of the 4 hardest filtered subjets and require the resulting invariant mass to be in a mass window around the top quark mass .",
    "we call this object our top candidate . 7 .",
    "[ step7 ] again we follow the heptoptagger and construct exactly three @xmath61 ordered subjets @xmath62 from the top candidate s constituents . if the masses @xmath63 satisfy the so - called a - cut of  @xcite , we consider the top tag to be successful .",
    "one guiding principle of the outlined algorithm is not to bias the mass distribution for the top and @xmath4candidates . particularly at high @xmath61 ,",
    "splittings of massless quarks and gluons can geometrically induce a large jet mass @xmath64 @xcite . depending on the jet @xmath10cut in the event",
    ", the average jet mass can be much bigger than the top quark mass .",
    "therefore , looking explicitly for structures in very hard jets which fulfill simple mass requirements can result in a large fake rate .    the sensitivity to fluctuations in the fraction of charged particles is reduced by scaling the subjet momenta by @xmath51 .",
    "this procedure relies on the assumption that the energy fraction carried by charged particles is similar in all subjets .",
    "figure  [ fig : alpha_subjet ] compares the particle level subjet @xmath65 , i.e. , the inverse of the energy fraction carried by charged particles with @xmath66  mev and @xmath67 inside a subjet , to the particle level @xmath51 calculated from the fat jet .",
    "the events used for this figure contain decays of the @xmath2boson of section  [ sec : res ] to @xmath68 with @xmath69  tev .",
    "the distributions are very similar for @xmath70  tev . for most of the leading @xmath10subjets ( subjets 1 ) , the ratio is @xmath71 , whereas for most of the subjets 2 ( subleading @xmath10subjets ) and subjets 3 , the ratios are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the fat jet quantity @xmath51 is therefore a good approximation to the subjet @xmath65 .",
    "we note that the subjet @xmath65 can not be calculated at the detector level because no calibrations exist for the small calorimeter subjets ( @xmath45 ) we are interested in",
    ".     for the three subjets found by the hpttoptaggerin fat jets in events with @xmath74 decays where @xmath69  tev .",

    ", width=288 ]    in step [ step2 ] we use only tracks for @xmath50 . by including photons measured in a finely grained electromagnetic calorimeter in addition to the tracks , it is possible to obtain a richer jet substructure and a better energy resolution of the rescaled track jet , i.e. , a better mass reconstruction of the top candidate .",
    "this enhancement is currently not implemented because the fast detector simulation we are using applies the same segmentation to the electromagnetic and hadronic parts of the calorimeter . in figure",

    "the distribution is wider in the latter case because of fluctuations in the photon fraction .",
    "the effect on the reconstructed top mass is shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "here the distribution obtained at the particle level when applying the above prescription and using only charged particles in step [ step2 ] is compared to the two cases in which charged particles and photons or all particles are used .",
    "the impact of the fluctuations in the charged - to - neutral particle ratio are already significantly reduced when adding photon information , leading to a narrower mass distribution .",
    "this better top quark momentum reconstruction will also improve the @xmath68resonance mass resolution .",
    "the sensitivity to the charged - to - neutral fluctuations can be reduced by choosing a large enough top quark mass window . with a window from @xmath75 to @xmath76  gev",
    "we see only a small efficiency increase of a couple of percent when adding photons .",
    "it is well known that track - based observables are not infrared safe  @xcite .",
    "therefore non - perturbative contributions have to be taken into account to obtain finite and well - defined results . in full event generators like pythia",
    ", hadronization models including fragmentation functions are used .",
    "these functions are non - perturbative objects following perturbative evolution equations and are usually fitted to lep data .",
    "the fraction of charged particles is unknown within limits imposed by measurements of the jet fragmentation function  @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : perf ] we compare the top quark reconstruction efficiency for the hpttoptagger between herwig++and pythia8 .",
    "although the cone size for highly boosted top quarks does not need to be big , we find that using filtering @xcite in step  [ step6 ] improves the performance of the tagger in separating top jets from qcd jets .",
    "our goal is to achieve a flat tagging efficiency independent of the top quark s transverse momentum .",
    "thus , to decide if a tag was successful we use invariant masses in step  [ step7 ] .",

    "ultimately , at very high top quark @xmath10 , the track reconstruction will struggle to resolve the tracks left by nearby particles .",
    "the limit is reached when the hits are so close that they are part of the same reconstructed track and the track reconstruction efficiency suffers as a consequence .",
    "the atlas tracking efficiency is @xmath78 for @xmath79  mev and rises to @xmath80 for @xmath81  gev  @xcite . to take the close - by effect into account we have used a reduced tracking efficiency of @xmath77 which corresponds to a @xmath43 relative loss of efficiency at high @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that this efficiency is a conservative lower limit and treat it as constant in @xmath10 .",
    "a careful study of the tracking efficiency as a function of @xmath10is needed but can only be done with access to the full detector simulation .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "the smallest simulated calorimeter entities are calorimeter cells , which for @xmath82 have a size @xmath83 in @xmath12 ( and double this @xmath33 size for @xmath84 ) .",
    "no clustering of these cells is performed , leading to smaller calorimeter structures than those that would be available with the real atlas calorimeter .",

    "@xmath26@xmath47 jets with @xmath85  gev are built from calorimeter cells and are required to lie within @xmath67 .",
    "tracks with @xmath66  mev and @xmath67 are matched to these jets using ghost association  @xcite as follows .",
    "a ghost of every track is created by setting the @xmath10to a small value ( @xmath86  ev ) and using the track @xmath31 and @xmath33 at the calorimeter surface .",
    "the energy of the ghost is set to @xmath87 times its momentum to ensure a positive ghost mass .",
    "the ghost tracks are added to the calorimeter jet clustering but do nt change the jet because their energy is negligible .",
    "if the ghost track ends up in the jet then the original track is taken to be associated with the jet .",

    "the calorimeter jet and the track jet serve as inputs @xmath48 and @xmath50 to the hpttoptagger procedure defined in section  [ sec : toptag ] .",
    "the heptoptagger as proposed in  @xcite was designed to work for mildly boosted top quarks , which required a large radius parameter of @xmath88 to geometrically catch the decay products .",
    "for the reconstruction of highly boosted top quarks we use as inputs to the heptoptaggerthe calorimeter @xmath47 jets to compare directly to the hpttoptaggerbut note that the heptoptaggeris optimized to achieve a high rejection of background that is picked up by using the large radius .",
    "we also modify the original algorithm by stopping the mass drop procedure already if the subjet mass is below 50  gev ( originally 30  gev ) because this was the preferred value in  @xcite .",
