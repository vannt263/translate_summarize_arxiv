    "although the type ii ( and ib , ic ) supernovae are generally believed to be associated with gravitational collapses of massive star cores at the end of their life , the explosion mechanism of the collapse - driven supernova has not yet been clarified .",
    "two possible scenarios are so far discussed : the prompt ( wilson 1971 ; hillebrandt 1982 ; arnett 1983 ; hillebrandt , nomoto , & wolff 1984 ; baron , cooperstein , & kahana 1985 ) or delayed ( wilson 1985 ; bethe & wilson 1985 ) explosion . if the prompt explosion obtains , the envelope of progenitor stars is directly expelled on the time scale of @xmath4 10 msec by the shock wave , which is generated by the core bounce when collapse has compressed the inner core of massive stars up to supranuclear densities .",
    "it is known that , however , this mechanism can work only when the progenitor star is relatively small ( @xmath5 ) and equation of state is soft enough , otherwise the shock wave loses its energy by photodissociation of heavy nuclei and neutrino emission behind the shock front , and finally stalls .",
    "therefore the delayed explosion scenario , in which the stalled shock is revived by the heating of neutrinos from the nascent neutron star on the time scale of @xmath4 1 sec , is considered to be likely .",
    "since electromagnetic waves can not convey to us any information of dense and deep region relevant to the explosion mechanism , the detection of a neutrino burst by large underground detectors is almost the only chance to get some observational clues for the explosion mechanism .",
    "supernova neutrinos have already been detected from the supernova sn1987a , which appeared in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , by the two water erenkov detectors , kamiokande ii ( hirata et al .",
    "1987 , 1988 ) and imb ( bionta et al 1987 ; bratton et al .",
    "although these detections were epoch - making events , the small numbers of captured neutrinos ( 11 for kamiokande and 8 for imb ) were unfortunately too small to tell us something about the explosion mechanism .",
    "however , an international network of second - generation neutrino detectors is now emerging on the earth , and a future event in our galaxy or magellanice clouds would give us much more detailed data necessary to understand the explosion mechanism ( see , e.g. , burrows , klein , & gandhi 1992 ) . among such underground detectors ,",
    "the super - kamiokande ( sk ) detector , which is about 15 times larger than the kamiokande , has started its observation and would detect 500010000 @xmath0 s if a supernova appeared in the galactic center ( 10 kpc away from the earth ) ( totsuka 1992 ; nakamura et al .",
    "1994 ) . because the signatures of the explosion mechanism are seen in the time evolution of the neutrino luminosity and spectrum , statistical reconstruction of the time evolution , that requires a large number of events ,",
    "is crucially important . from this viewpoint , the sk ,",
    "to which we confine ourselves in this paper , is the most suitable detector to probe the explosion mechanism because of its largest detector mass and good energy resolution , among the existing or planned detectors .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the signatures of the delayed explosion mechanism which are observable in the time evolution of the @xmath0 luminosity and spectrum at the sk , by using a numerical model of supernova neutrino emission and realistic monte - carlo simulations of the detection by the sk .",
    "the simplest analysis is to set many bins in the time coordinate and estimate the luminosity and average energy in each bin .",
    "however , this analysis is not sufficient to reproduce a smooth evolutionary curve and some information of detection time is also lost .",
    "we propose an analysis method based on the maximum likelihood method and cubic - interpolation , which gives natural and smooth evolution without loss of time information , and test this method by using mc data generated from the numerical supernova model .",
    "because the supernova neutrinos are emitted thermally , the fermi - dirac ( fd ) distribution was generally assumed in previous analyses for the sn1987a data ( loredo & lamb 1989 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , it is known that because the neutrino opacity changes with neutrino energy , the spectrum of neutrinos deviates from the pure fd distribution with zero chemical potential .",
    "the emergent neutrino spectrum can be considered to be a blackbody radiation from a surface whose radius varies with neutrino energy , and deficit in both the low and high energy range compared to the pure fd distribution is seen ( bruenn 1987 ; mayle , wilson , & schramm 1987 ; janka & hillebrandt 1989 ; giovanoni , ellison , & bruenn 1989 ; myra & burrows 1990 ) .",
    "the rich statistics of the sk may allow us to discern this deviation , and if observed , it would provide a verification for the current theoretical picture of supernova explosion and neutrino emission .",
    "hence we also investigate whether we can see this deviation of neutrino spectrum from the fd distribution in future observations .    in  [ section : simulation ] , we describe the numerical model of a supernova explosion used in this paper , and the features of the delayed explosion are discussed .",
    "the properties of the sk detector are summarized in  [ section : sk - mc ] , and monte - calro data generation from the numerical supernova model is also described . statistical analysis for the mc data and its results",
    "are presented in ",
    "[ section : analysis ] , and after some discussions in  [ section : discussion ] , we summarize our results in  [ section : summary ] .",
    "we use a result of neutrino emission based on a numerical simulation of supernova explosion .",
    "the simulation is performed with the numerical codes developed by wilson and mayle ( mayle 1985 ; wilson et al 1986 ; mayle , wilson , & schramm 1987 ) . the simulation is a model of the sn1987a , whose progenitor is a main - sequence star of about 20 @xmath6 .",
    "the stellar configuration from which the explosion calculation started was supplied by woosley and weaver ( 1991 ) .",
    "this one dimensional simulation is performed from the onset of the collapse to 18 seconds after the core bounce in a consistent way , and the total energy emitted by this time is 2.9 @xmath7 erg .",
    "the emitted energy in @xmath0 s is 4.7 @xmath8 erg and the average energy of @xmath0 s is 15.3 mev .",
    "figure [ fig : wm - log ] shows the time evolution of luminosity and average energy of this model , for @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "[ the neutrino luminosity and spectrum of supernova @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ( referred to @xmath10 , hereafter ) are almost the same . ]",
    "figure [ fig : wm - spec ] shows the snapshots of the spectral evolution of supernova @xmath0 s in the form of differential number luminosity .",
    "fd spectra which have the same luminosity and average energy with zero chemical potential are also shown by dashed lines in the figure , and the deficit of both low- and high - energy neutrinos can be seen . in the following analysis ,",
    "fd distributions will be introduced to provide a simple method of analyzing the possible observational data and do not represent any expected spectral shape . for generic features of supernova neutrino emission ,",
    "see , e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .    figure [ fig : mt ] shows the radius of selected mass points as a function of time for the present model .",
    "this model explodes by the delayed explosion mechanism , and its features are stamped onto the early evolution of neutrino luminosity and spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wm - lin ] , in which the evolution of neutrino luminosity and average energy in the first @xmath13 second after the core bounce are shown .",
    "a characteristic of the delayed mechanism is a `` hump '' in the neutrino luminosity curve due to the accretion of matter onto the nascent neutron star .",
    "[ this `` hump '' is the same with the phenomenon previously discussed in burrows et al .",
    "( 1992 ) as `` abrupt drop in luminosity curve '' . ]",
    "the average energy of neutrinos stays low during the hump because of the dense matter above the neutrino sphere which contributes to the neutrino opacity .",
    "the average energy gradually increases during this phase , corresponding to gradual decay of mass accretion before the delayed explosion commences .",
    "therefore this gradual hardening of neutrino spectrum also gives another observable signature of the delayed explosion .",
    "after the accretion decays , the evolution time scale in both the luminosity and average energy becomes much longer than that in the earlier phase .",
    "the time duration of the hump in the delayed explosion is very hard to calculate from first principles so the measurement of this duration is most important for the understanding of the explosion process . on the other hand , if the prompt mechanism were viable , the envelope would be expelled in @xmath14(10 ) msec after the core bounce and there would be no hump in the luminosity curve because of no matter accretion .",
    "the neutrino spectrum would become harder just after the core bounce and explosion , in contrast to the delayed explosion .",
    "this mechanism is likely at work for relatively low mass stars .    in the present model of supernova explosion ,",
    "this hump is clearly discernible corresponding to the matter accretion during the first 0.5 [ sec ] .",
    "we concentrate on these two features , i.e. , the hump in neutrino luminosity and increase in average energy during the first @xmath4 0.5 [ sec ] as the signatures of the delayed explosion .",
    "it should be noted , however , that these features of the delayed explosion generally depend on the mass of initial iron cores or progenitor stars .",
    "the more massive iron cores lead to the more complicated structure in time evolution of neutrino luminosity and spectrum . in some calculations of the delayed explosion (",
    "mayle 1985 ; mayle , wilson , & schramm 1987 ) , oscillatory behavior was observed whose existence may depend on the initial structure of the star .",
    "the super - kamiokande detector ( totsuka 1992 ; nakamura et al .",
    "1994 ) is a water erenkov detector whose fiducial volume for a supernova neutrino burst is 32,000 ton .",
    "we have performed monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations for the detection of supernova neutrinos by this detector , which give a data set of detection time and energy of events .",
    "we use only the time and energy information of electrons or positrons , and do not consider the directional information because positrons are emitted almost isotropically in the dominant @xmath3 reaction .",
    "the following reactions are taken into account : @xmath15 where c.c . and n.c .",
    "referred to charged and neutral current , respectively , and @xmath16 is the threshold energy of neutrinos . for the cross sections of @xmath3 and @xmath17o reactions",
    ", we referred to vogel ( 1984 ) and haxton ( 1987 ) , respectively .",
    "although the cross sections of oxygen reactions are less certain than others , this uncertainty hardly affects the following results because of the much smaller number of events than that of the @xmath3 reaction .",
    "recently langanke , vogel , & kolbe ( 1996 ) pointed out that ( @xmath18 ) and ( @xmath19 ) reactions on @xmath20o constitute significant signals in the observed @xmath21-ray energy range of @xmath22 10 mev , which are not included in our mc code .",
    "the signal would allow a unique identification of @xmath10 , but simultaneously be a serious noise against @xmath3 events , in which we are interested here , because the sk can not distinguish @xmath21-rays and positrons in this energy range . in order to avoid this noise",
    ", we set the threshold energy of positron energy , @xmath23 mev .",
    "because the detection efficiency of the sk is 100 % above @xmath24 8 mev , where @xmath25 is energy of electrons or positrons , we do not have to consider the detection efficiency .",
    "the energy resolution of the sk , 16 @xmath26 ( % ) ( nakamura et al . 1994 ) , is taken into account in our mc codes assuming the gaussian distribution .",
    "[ for details of the mc data generation of water erenkov detectors , see , e.g. , krauss et al .",
    "our mc simulation is basically similar to that of krauss et al . ]    the time - integrated , expected event distribution in positron or electron energy at the sk is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dnde ] for each reaction mode , for the case of a supernova at the galactic center , i.e. , @xmath1 = 10 kpc .",
    "an example of the mc simulation is also shown as a histogram , which includes all reaction modes . because we set @xmath27 = 10 mev",
    ", the contamination of scattering events and oxygen events to @xmath0p events is negligible .",
    "figure [ fig : mc - time ] shows the time histogram of events of this sample data set . the numerical supernova model used here produces about 8300 events in the range of @xmath28 [ sec ] , when @xmath1 = 10 kpc .",
    "most of these events are due to the @xmath3 reaction .",
    "the neutrino - electron scattering reactions produce about 200 events , and the @xmath2 and @xmath0 absorptions into @xmath20o produce about 100 .",
    "since we can not know the exact time of the onset of the collapse , we set the time of the first event to zero .",
    "the neutronization burst , namely , a strong peak in @xmath2 luminosity ( reaching @xmath29 erg / sec after 34 msec after the core bounce ) when the shock wave passes the neutrino sphere has attracted great attention of researchers because its signal could be used for probing the electron neutrino mass or probing the neutrino oscillation such as @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "it is also expected that this signal is more energetic if the delayed explosion mechanism obtains rather than the prompt mechanism ( burrows et al .",
    "1992 ) . however , the burst duration is @xmath4 a few msec and emitted energy as @xmath2 s is therefore only several @xmath32 erg .",
    "in addition , the cross section of @xmath33 scattering is about 12 orders of magnitude lower than that of the @xmath3 reaction , and hence it is doubtful that we can clearly recognize the neutronization burst even in the case of a galactic supernova detected by the sk . during the neutronization burst ,",
    "the average energy of @xmath2 s is @xmath4 11 mev and expected number of scattering events is @xmath34 .",
    "figure [ fig : mc - time - early ] shows an example of the mc simulation for very early events including the neutronization burst ; the solid line is for electron scattering events mainly due to @xmath2 s , while the dashed line is for @xmath3 events .",
    "although the scattering events are strongly forward peaked , it seems difficult to distinguish the neutronization burst from @xmath3 events when we take account of the angular resolution of the sk ( @xmath4 30@xmath35 ) .",
    "in the following part of this paper we consider reconstruction of @xmath0 flux and spectrum from @xmath3 events . in order to seek the signature of the delayed explosion mechanism",
    ", we have to reconstruct the time evolution of @xmath0 luminosity and spectrum during the first 1 sec after the bounce .",
    "the simplest procedure to do this is to divide the time coordinate into many bins and estimate the luminosity and average energy in each time - bin .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 be number of events , width , and average energy of positrons or electrons in the @xmath39-th bin , in the energy range where analysis is performed . as mentioned in ",
    "[ section : sk - mc ] , we take this energy range as @xmath40= 10 mev . in the following analysis , we assume the fermi - dirac distribution with a single temperature and zero chemical potential for the simplicity .",
    "as discussed in introduction , this assumption is clearly oversimplification , but since we are interested in the time evolution of @xmath0 luminosity and average energy , this assumption does not affect the conclusion seriously . note that the analyzed mc data are generated by a numerical simulation of multi - energy - group neutrino diffusion which does not assume any shape of neutrino spectrum .",
    "this makes it possible for us to investigate whether we can see the deviation of the neutrino spectrum from the pure fd distribution by comparing the fd fits to energy distributions of mc data .",
    "we have also tried a fit with time - evolving , nonzero chemical potential in fd distribution , but it is found that we cannnot constrain strongly the chemical potential , if we set a rather high threshold , @xmath27= 10 mev .",
    "we can then easily estimate the luminosity @xmath41 and effective temperature @xmath42 in the @xmath39-th bin by solving the following equations : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the expected event rate per unit time per unit energy , which is generally given in the following form : @xmath45 in the above expression , @xmath46 and @xmath47 run all neutrino types and possible reactions , respectively , and @xmath48 is neutrino energy , @xmath49 differential number flux of neutrinos per unit neutrino energy , @xmath50 differential cross section , @xmath51 total number of target particles in the detector , and @xmath52 the detection efficiency ( 100 % if @xmath40 ) .",
    "although the sample data set generated from the mc code includes all reactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : anue - p])([eq : anue - o ] ) , we analyze the data considering only the dominant @xmath3 reaction for simplicity . in this approximation ,",
    "the differential cross section is ( vogel 1984 ; burrows 1988 ) @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 the axial - vector coupling constant ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 positron momentum , and @xmath58 the neutron - proton mass difference ( 1.294 mev ) .",
    "the weak - magnetism correction , @xmath59 , is approximately @xmath60/mev .",
    "the @xmath0 number flux , @xmath61 , is expressed as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the chemical potential , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , ( the boltzman constant is set to the unity ) and @xmath66 is defined as @xmath67 in the following analysis we set @xmath68 and assume that the distance to the supernova is known .",
    "if the distance is uncertain in practical analysis in the future , the luminosity should be replaced by the bolometric flux , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "we show a result of this time - binning analysis on a sample data set ( @xmath1 = 10 kpc ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : d10-bin ] .",
    "luminosity and average energy of @xmath0 s above @xmath70 , which are calculated from @xmath41 and @xmath42 obtained by solving the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bin1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bin2 ] ) , are shown as the data points .",
    "the time bins are defined so that the event numbers in each bin are the same among the bins .",
    "the number of events in one bin is @xmath4 400 in this figure .",
    "the statistical errors can approximately be estimated as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the observed standard deviation of @xmath25 in the @xmath39-th bin .",
    "the error in luminosity is inferred from poissonian statistics and that in temperature from the statistical 1 @xmath73 error in the observed @xmath74 .",
    "dashed lines are luminosity and average energy of the numerical supernova model above @xmath75 ) .",
    "it should be noted that we can not know the offset time of the first event in a future detection , but for the purpose of comparison , we plot the fitted results in the same time coordinate with the numerical supernova model unless otherwise stated .",
    "the obtained luminosity and average energy well agree with those of the original numerical supernova model .",
    "although the fitted average energy seems systematically lower than the original because of the deviation from the fd distribution or contamination of reactions other than @xmath3 , this systematic error is sufficiently small .",
    "however , it should be noted that significant systematic errors emerge when we extrapolate the obtained neutrino spectrum down to lower energy range below the threshold with the assumed fd distributions .",
    "figure [ fig : d10-bin - whole ] is the same as figure [ fig : d10-bin ] , but for the whole energy range including @xmath76 .",
    "it is clear that an analysis assuming the fd distribution leads to systematic overestimation in luminosity and underestimation in average energy , because the spectrum with obtained @xmath42 significantly overestimates the neutrino flux below the threshold energy .",
    "this comes from the fact that spectrum of numerical supernova models is ` pinched ' , i.e. , deficient in both low- and high - energy range compared to the pure fd distribution .",
    "the features of the delayed mechanism discussed in ",
    "[ section : simulation ] can be seen clearly by this simple analysis .",
    "therefore a supernova at the galactic center is near enough to get information for the explosion mechanism .",
    "now let us consider a case when a supernova is more distant from the earth .",
    "figure [ fig : lmc - bin ] is the same as figure [ fig : d10-bin ] , but for a supernova at the lmc ( @xmath1 = 50 kpc ) .",
    "the event number in each time bin is about 30 .",
    "the statistical errors become larger and the features of the explosion mechanism are obscured by the bin width and statistical errors .",
    "it is difficult to reconstruct a smooth time evolution from these discrete data points .",
    "here we point out that although the time - binning analysis is simple and easy , this method loses some important information and we can reproduce a smooth evolution more efficiently by other methods of analysis . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the information loss in the time - binning analysis and propose a new method which uses a likelihood function and cubic - interpolation .",
    "the time - binning analysis is simple and clear , but it loses some important information in the following two points .",
    "first , the detection time of each event is smoothed out in the time bin in which the event is included .",
    "generally water erenkov detectors have fairly good time resolution ( much better than msec ) , but the time - binning analysis can not extract any information on the time scale shorter than the bin width .",
    "second , the events in a bin are treated independently of those in other bins , and this leads to statistical fluctuation in the obtained results between neighboring bins . if we assume the time evolution is smooth , we can suppress the statistical fluctuation to some extent by smoothing .",
    "we consider here an analysis method which is more effective in the above two points than the time - binning analysis .    in order not to lose any information about detection time of each event",
    ", we use the well - known maximum likelihood analysis , where the likelihood function for the analysis of supernova neutrinos is given as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are detection time and energy of @xmath80-th event , @xmath81 the total number of events , and @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 are the boundaries of the analysis region in the ( @xmath86 , @xmath25 ) space , which can be set arbitrarily . [ for the derivation of this function , see , e.g. , loredo & lamb ( 1989 ) . ] because we are interested in the time evolution , we assume the fd distribution with @xmath68 for energy spectrum .",
    "then expected @xmath87 can be calculated if the time evolution of @xmath88 and @xmath89 is given .",
    "generally this time evolution is modeled by some analytic functions , e.g. , exponential or power - law decay , but the time evolution with which we are concerned can not be modeled with any simple functions .",
    "we therefore set some grid points in the time coordinate , @xmath90 , ( @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are defined as @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "we model @xmath96 and @xmath97 by the natural - cubic - spline interpolation in order to reproduce a smooth evolution .",
    "the merit of use of this interpolation is not only that we can get a smooth time evolution , but the statistical fluctuation is also suppressed .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "most methods for smooth interpolation , including the natural - cubic - spline , are generally unstable to random fluctuation between the neighboring grids , or to a random pattern .",
    "if the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 become unrealistically random , values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 at points between the defined grids will become artificially oscillatory and then the likelihood function evaluated with cubic - spline interpolation will become lower .",
    "therefore this method is expected to suppress unnecessary statistical fluctuation in time evolution .",
    "now we can find the best - fit time evolution in @xmath88 and @xmath89 by searching maximum of @xmath98 in the model parameter space , @xmath99 .",
    "we have adopted this analysis method to the mc data for a supernova at @xmath1 = 10 and 50 kpc , and the results about the luminosity and average energy above the threshold energy ( @xmath100 ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : d10-ncs ] and [ fig : lmc - ncs5 ] .",
    "we set the time grids so that the event numbers per one time grid is @xmath4 800 and @xmath4 60 for @xmath1 = 10 and 50 kpc , respectively , and these grids are expressed as crosses in the figures .",
    "the best - fit curves of both cases ( solid lines ) well reproduce the smooth time evolution of the original numerical supernova model ( dashed lines ) . these results should be compared with those of the time - binning analysis shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : d10-bin ] and [ fig : lmc - bin ] , and it can be seen that this method is useful to reconstruct a smooth and natural time evolution especially when a supernova is distant and available events are fewer . for the @xmath101 kpc case",
    "the difference of the two methods is not so important because of rich statistics , but the initial steep rise of the luminosity curve can better be reproduced by the likelihood analysis than the time - binning analysis . in order to show the statistical uncertainties in the above analysis , we make other five data sets of mc simulation from the same numerical supernova model for the @xmath1 = 50 kpc case , and do the same analysis for all of them .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmc - ncs5 - 5mc ] , and this figure should be compared to the statistical errors in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmc - bin ] .",
    "the number of grid points defined on the time coordinate is crucially important in the above analysis .",
    "we should choose a sufficient number of grids which can resolve the time scale in which we are interested , but it is apparent that if we set too many time grids , the statistical fluctuation per one grid will become larger and obtained results become unstable . in figs .",
    "[ fig : lmc - ncs10 ] and [ fig : lmc - ncs20 ] , we show the result of the same analysis about the @xmath102 kpc data with different number of grids ; the number of grid points is increased by factors of 2 and 4 from that in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmc - ncs5 ] , respectively .",
    "the instability can be seen clearly , and therefore discrimination of the true time evolution from sham evolution due to statistical fluctuation is important . in a practical analysis in the future , we should try various intervals of grids taking account the statistical errors estimated by the time - binning analysis .",
    "the goodness - of - fit test , which we discuss in the next section , will also help us to discriminate a true evolution from statistical fluctuations .",
    "if we get sufficient goodness - of - fit with a given number of grids , the analysis with more grids is unnecessary .",
    "generally a statistical analysis includes the following three procedures : 1 ) find the best fit parameters , 2 ) estimate the statistical errors , and 3 ) check whether the best - fit model is consistent with the observed data . here",
    "we consider the third procedure , a so - called goodness - of - fit ( gof ) test .",
    "if a likelihood function is given with some assumptions about the model , it is rather a straightforward process to find the best - fit parameters .",
    "however , the likelihood analysis itself does not verify the assumed model , and therefore we have to check whether the observed data naturally come out from the assumed model with best - fit parameters .",
    "we use the two - dimensional version of the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test ( peacock 1983 ; fasano & fianceschini 1987 ) as a tool of the gof test .",
    "the ks measure @xmath103 , which is a measure of deviation of the observed data from the best - fit model , is defined as follows .",
    "first , we define the expected and observed fraction of events in the four quadrants of @xmath104 space : @xmath105 and @xmath106 , where @xmath46 (= 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) denotes the four quadrants : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "the quantity @xmath111 is the number of events in the @xmath46-th quadrant , and @xmath112 is the total expected number of events in the whole analysis region .",
    "then @xmath113 is defined as the maximum of the absolute difference of @xmath114 and @xmath115 , i.e. , @xmath116 we can check the consistency between the observed data and the best - fit model by comparing @xmath113 of the observed data and probability distribution of @xmath113 expected from the best - fit model .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath113 is unknown in this two dimensional case , and we have to estimate this by a number of mc simulations .    we have applied this test on the results obtained by the likelihood analysis in the previous section for both the @xmath1 = 10 and 50 kpc cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d10-ncs ] and [ fig : lmc - ncs5 ] ) , by using the probability distribution of @xmath113 obtained by 100 mc simulations .",
    "it is found that the best - fit model and the mc data are statistically consistent for the @xmath1 = 50 kpc case , but inconsistent for the @xmath1 = 10 kpc case with more than 99 % c.l . because the time evolution is considered to be modeled appropriately , this suggests that the inconsistency comes from the assumption of the fd distribution in energy spectrum .",
    "this means that , in other words , we can distinguish the difference of the real spectral shape of supernova @xmath0 s from pure fd distributions when a supernova occurs nearer than 10 kpc . in order to demonstrate this",
    ", we plot the time - integrated energy spectrum of events expected from the best - fit model obtained by the likelihood analysis assuming the fd distribution , by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dnde - d10 ] for the @xmath1 = 10 kpc case .",
    "the histogram is the analyzed mc data and the solid line is the expected spectrum of the numerical model from which the mc data are generated .",
    "the difference of the dashed line from the histogram is clearly discernible ; overestimation at @xmath117 mev and underestimation at @xmath118 mev .",
    "this deviation should be considered as a prediction of a standard picture of neutrino emission from collapse - driven supernovae and can be tested in a future observation .",
    "figure [ fig : dnde - d50 ] is the same as figure [ fig : dnde - d10 ] , but for the @xmath1 = 50 kpc case . in this case",
    "it seems difficult to see the deviation from the fd distribution , and this is consistent with the results of the gof test .",
    "neutrino - driven rayleigh - taylor instabilities between the stalled shock wave and the neutrinospheres are generic feature of collapse - driven supernovae ( bethe 1990 ; herant , benz , & colgate 1992 ; herant et al .",
    "1994 ; burrows , hayes , & fryxell 1995 ; janka & mller 1996 ; mezzacappa et al . 1996 ) .",
    "such instability ineviably leads to convective motion in the energy gain region and asphericity in the dynamics , that should have significant effects on the explosion mechanism ( see , e.g. , burrows 1997 for a review ) .",
    "although the presented 1-d calculation takes account of convective motion by the mixing length theory , there may be some effects that can not be covered by 1-d calculation .",
    "it is interesting to consider the possible signatures of such asymmetry imprinted in neutrino emission , but unfortunately at the present stage the effect of convective motion on the emergent neutrino luminosity or spectrum is poorly known .",
    "furthermore , rotation might tend to wash out otherwise detectable flux variations due to convective motion .",
    "in fact , the crab pulsar rotates at approximately 200 radians / sec , and this rotation will presumably smear out other underlying observable variations .",
    "there are some interesting hints for finite neutrino masses , such as the solar neutrino problem or the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "neutrino oscillations due to these possible masses might significantly change the emergent spectrum of neutrinos .",
    "if the vacuum mixing angle among the three generation of neutrinos is order unity , this leads to the vacuum neutrino oscillation . because supernova neutrinos come out through very dense matter , it is also possible that the msw neutrino oscillation occurs such as @xmath119 ( fuller et al .",
    "1987 ) . under the direct mass hierarchy of neutrinos ( i.e. , @xmath120 ) , the msw matter oscillation is relevant only for neutrinos and not for antineutrinos , but it is also possible that @xmath0 s , which we mainly discussed in this work , experience resonant matter oscillation with @xmath121 or @xmath31 , due to flavor - changing magnetic moment of majorana neutrinos [ spin - flavor precession , see e.g. , totani & sato ( 1996 ) ] .",
    "these phenomena might significantly change the neutrino spectrum , and detectability of these signature will be interesting topics in future work .",
    "we performed a statistical analysis for the future detection of a supernova neutrino burst at @xmath1 = 10 kpc ( the galactic center ) and @xmath1 = 50 kpc ( lmc ) by the super - kamiokande detector , by using a numerical supernova model and realistic monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations of detection .",
    "we mainly discussed the detectability of the signatures of the delayed explosion mechanism in the time evolution of the @xmath0 luminosity and spectrum : a hump during the first @xmath22 0.5 second and following abrupt drop in the @xmath0 luminosity curve , and also corresponding spectral hardening .",
    "[ it should be noted that these signatures generally depend on the mass and internal structure of the progenitor star .",
    "the model used is for sn1987a , i.e. , its progenitor is a @xmath4 20 @xmath122 main - sequence star . ]",
    "the @xmath2 neutronization burst is considered to be more energetic for the delayed explosion and hence could be another clue to the explosion mechanism .",
    "however our simulation of the delayed explosion produces only about 5 scattering events due to neutronization burst when @xmath1 = 10 kpc , and it seems difficult to distinguish clearly the burst from @xmath3 events .",
    "we analyzed mc data generated from the numerical supernova model in the energy range above 10 mev ( to avoid background noise ) , and found the following results .",
    "1 ) the signatures of the delayed explosion in @xmath0 luminosity curve and spectral evolution are clearly discernible for the @xmath1 = 10 kpc case , and moreover , the difference of the real energy spectrum from pure fermi - dirac ( fd ) distribution can also be observable .",
    "2 ) for the @xmath1 = 50 kpc case , the signature of the delayed explosion is still observable , but statistical fluctuation is too large to distinguish the deviation from the fd distribution .",
    "these results suggest that we will be able to distinguish the two proposed explosion mechanisms if a supernova occurs in our galaxy or magellanic cloulds in the near future .",
    "the deviation from the fd distribution would , if observed , provide an important test for the standard picture of neutrino emission from collapse - driven supernovae . the fd fitting leads to significant overestimation of flux in lower energy region ( @xmath22 15 mev ) , and this results in overestimation in luminosity and underestimation in average energy",
    ". we should be careful for this in a future analysis when the obtained results are extrapolated down to the lower energy region below the threshold .",
    "time - binning analysis is the simplest method to reconstruct the time evolution of @xmath0 flux and spectrum , but this method loses some important information and hence is not maximally effective .",
    "therefore we proposed a method for reconstruction of the time evolution , which gives a smoother time evolution and smaller statistical errors than the simple time - binning analysis .",
    "this method is based on the likelihood analysis , and its characteristic is the use of cubic - spline interpolation to express the time evolution of @xmath0 luminosity and effective temperature with some selected grid points on the time coordinate .",
    "the likelihood analysis does not lose any detection time information and the stability of the cubic - spline interpolation to random fluctuation suppresses statistical fluctuations .",
    "this method is useful especially when available number of events is relatively small , e.g. , a supernova in the lmc or smc .",
