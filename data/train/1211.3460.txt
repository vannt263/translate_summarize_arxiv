    ", we consider a dataset from @xcite , comprising 200 patients discharged from an adult intensive care unit ( icu ) .",
    "the data is cross - classified into survival status following hospital discharge ( 0 = lived ; 1 = died ) and type of admission into icu ( 0 = elective ; 1 = emergency ) , as shown in table [ tab : application ] .",
    "along with these two variables , the age of each patient at the time of admission was also recorded .",
    "we are interested in seeing whether and how the association between survival and admission type varies according to age .",
    "more generally , we want to quantify the degree of local association between @xmath0 and @xmath1 conditional on @xmath12 . +",
    "a traditional method for accomplishing this involves discretizing @xmath2 into several levels , and considering the odds ratio in each partial table @xcite .",
    "this technique however does not preserve the continuous nature of @xmath2 ( age ) , resulting in a potential loss of information .",
    "a more commonly applied method is a model - based one , utilizing the odds ratio resulting from the logistic regression model below , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the conditional probability of ` success ' for the i@xmath15 observation .",

    "+ however , since these odds ratios are by - products of generalized linear models ( glms , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they incur the problems associated with parametric regression .",
    "the logit linearity assumption means these measures lack flexibility and risk model mis - specification .",
    "for instance , it is clear from ( [ eqn : logreg ] ) that there is an overly strict demand for the odds ratio to be increasing or decreasing in an exponential manner over @xmath2 .",
    "+ to introduce greater flexibility , a commonplace alternative is to utilize a generalized additive models ( gams , * ? ? ?",

    "equivalently , ( [ eqn : gammodel ] ) can also be regarded as a varying coefficient model @xcite .",
    "in fact , this model nonparametrically fits two separate curves , one for each level of @xmath21 , and the log odds ratio estimate is obtained from the difference of these two curves @xcite . using gams to estimate local odds ratios has been considered before by @xcite amongst others , although their motivation stemmed from a regression context and thus considered @xmath0 as continuous also .",
    "@xcite proposed estimation of odds ratios using gams with unknown link functions , but their developments were again limited to @xmath0 continuous .",

    "we seek a flexible measure of local association that is _ not _ model - based in any sense .",
    "+ in this paper , we propose a fully nonparametric measure of conditional association , formed by extending the global @xmath8 to the local case . by exploiting the flexibility of kernel regression ,",
    "our `` pointwise odds ratio '' permits a continuous @xmath2 , while avoiding the hazards of model mis - specification . using kernel regression to estimate the pointwise odds ratio was first suggested by @xcite , although it was not explored in any depth there .",
    "this idea was also independently proposed by @xcite , although our work explores the problem much more thoroughly . specifically , we propose adjusted estimators of the pointwise log odds ratio which have better statistical properties compared to a basic plug - in approach .",
    "we also develop confidence intervals for these new estimators .",
    "applying these methods to the icu dataset , we are able to gain a more nuanced view of the underlying relationships between age , type of admission , and survival status .",
    "the pointwise odds ratio is an intuitive extension of the global odds ratio defined in ( [ eqn : globalor ] ) , formed using the conditional probabilities @xmath23 , @xmath24 for @xmath5 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : orx ] ) can be broadened to produce a set of pointwise odds ratios for a general @xmath11 table , but we restrict developments here to the simplest case . also for simplicity here , we restrict attention to univariate @xmath2 , with the developments in this work generalizable to the multivariate case . evidently , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 implying conditional independence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at @xmath12 . + for the developments in this paper , the following distributional assumption is made :    [ ass : multinom ] the sample of observations can be described by @xmath27 , which form a sequence of i.i.d .",

    "* ) can be used to estimate @xmath37 for all four cells .",
    "this estimator is a sensible one to choose since , being a locally weighted average , it automatically guarantees estimated probabilities between 0 and 1 , unlike local linear or p - spline estimators for instance .",
    "it also ensures maximum flexibility in the estimation of @xmath38 . for @xmath39",
    ", we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the kernel function and bandwidth respectively . for the latter ,",
    "an optimal @xmath42 is obtained by minimizing the asymptotic mean integrated square error ( amise ) of @xmath43 .",
    "defining @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then from standard kernel regression theory @xcite we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the marginal density of @xmath2 .",
    "although the theory suggests that we should use four different bandwidths , one for each cell , it is argued in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.3 ) that it is more appealing instead to use a single , common @xmath42 for all cells , and this is what we will do here .",
    "then , it was showed in the same paper that , if @xmath50 then @xmath51 for @xmath52 , as suggested by ( [ eqn : hopt ] ) , we have @xmath53 implying the distribution of @xmath54 is not asymptotically centered at 0 . to deal with this undesired feature , we choose a sub - optimal bandwidth @xmath55 ( `` undersmoothing '' ,",
    "the bias is asymptotically negligible and the mean squared error is dominated by the variance ) as suggested among others by @xcite .",
    "a common choice is to take @xmath56 , and indeed in this article our developments will be exposed with this order of @xmath42 in mind .",
    "hence , the bias in the normality statement asymptotically vanishes and one obtains @xmath57 utilizing the conditional multinomial assumption [ ass : multinom ] and the cramr - wold device , a vectorial version is finally obtained for @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes a @xmath61 diagonal matrix with elements equal to the components of @xmath62 . + now , a simple plug - in estimator of @xmath38 is given by simple substitution of the nw conditional probabilities , @xmath63 furthermore , an asymptotic @xmath64 confidence interval ( ci ) for @xmath65 can be obtained via the delta method on ( [ eqn : phatnormalitynobias ] ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the @xmath68 quantile of the standard normal distribution , and @xmath49 is estimated by the standard kernel density estimator @xmath69 for simplicity , we use the same kernel @xmath41 and bandwidth @xmath42 as in @xmath43 , although this does not need to be the case .",
    "although the plug - in estimator and associated ci are easy to calculate , they suffer from two major drawbacks .",
    "first , like its classical unconditional counterpart , @xmath65 may be severely biased in finite samples .",
    "this is confirmed in the simulations of section [ subsec : simcompareest ] .",
    "second , if one or more of the @xmath43 s are close to 0 , then @xmath71 will either be close to 0 also or highly inflated . since ( [ eqn : logorhatci ] )",
    "has asymptotic variance proportional to @xmath72 , a small value for one of the @xmath43 s also significantly enlarges the ( estimated ) variance , making confidence intervals of little use . to remedy these two problems , we propose adding a small deterministic value @xmath73 to each @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to an amended estimator @xmath74 we seek a value of @xmath75 for which @xmath76 has asymptotically smaller bias compared to @xmath65 .",
    "although other methods of bias correcting an odds ratio estimator are available ( see for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* who use bootstrapping ) , these techniques are likely to produce similar statistical improvements compared to simply adding a small @xmath75 , at the cost of greater computational intensity .",
    "also , it is important to recognize that such an approach ( adding a small deterministic value to each probability ) has been taken before for @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , we have the adjusted measure proposed by @xcite @xmath77 as a reduced bias estimator of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite compared several estimators of @xmath8 , and found @xmath78 perform well with regards to bias and mean squared error .",
    "the form of ( [ eqn : globaloradjest ] ) is insightful not only because it is analogous to @xmath79 , but it shows that the adjustment made was @xmath80 i.e. , the variance rate of the parametric estimators @xmath81 .",
    "this suggests it might be appropriate to select @xmath82 in our nonparametric setting i.e. , the variance rate of the kernel based estimators .      by applying a number of taylor expansions and utilizing some standard kernel regression theory results on the moments of the nw estimator",
    ", we derived a general expression for the bias of the amended estimator ( [ eqn : amendedest ] ) , see appendix [ app : proofs ] for relevant assumptions and proof .",
    "it turns out that @xmath83 where @xmath84 is given below ( [ eqn : hopt ] ) . from this , we propose two possible values of @xmath75 which , along with the plug - in estimator ( estimator i , @xmath85 ) , are summarized in table [ tab : threeest ] .",
    "the first one is just @xmath86 , evidently canceling out the second term in ( [ eqn : biaslogortilde ] ) .",
    "the second one attempts to balance the first term also .",
    "note that , with @xmath56 as we suggested in section [ sec : pointwiseor ] , the amendment @xmath86 ( estimator ii in table [ tab : threeest ] ) only simplifies but does not explicitly reduce the asymptotic bias , as the first term in @xmath87 asymptotically dominates the second one in ( [ eqn : biaslogortilde ] ) .",
    "in fact , for this to provide a definite asymptotic bias reduction , we would need @xmath88 , which in turn requires @xmath89 .",
    "demanding such a bandwidth leads to a substantial amount of undersmoothing , to the extent that variance dominates and overwhelms any bias reduction achieved in the first place .",
    "this is to be avoided , and hence we maintain a reasonable amount of undersmoothing , driven by @xmath56 .",
    "+ for @xmath75 to explicitly reduce the asymptotic bias in this case , we need @xmath90 . with @xmath91 ( which is the case with @xmath92 ) , one can then rearrange ( [ eqn : biaslogortilde ] ) to produce the second , more involved amendment , see estimator iii in table [ tab : threeest ] .",
    "we call the amended estimator using this second value of @xmath75 @xmath93 , to distinguish it from the previous one . + despite estimator iii being one which actually produces an asymptotic bias reduction , we instead advocate the simpler amendment @xmath86 , and thus @xmath76 as the preferred estimator of the pointwise log odds ratio .",
    "the reasons for this are four - fold : 1 ) the adjustment @xmath86 has a simple form and interpretation .",
    "intuitively , it is a straight nonparametric analog of the @xmath94 adjustment in ( [ eqn : globaloradjest ] ) ; 2 ) the amendment @xmath86 is very simple to compute .",
    "in contrast , to calculate @xmath93 , one needs to estimate the bias terms @xmath48 .",
    "this could be done by plugging in kernel estimates of the derivatives @xcite , using local cubic smoothing @xcite , or via bootstrapping @xcite , although all of these methods are challenging to implement ; 3 ) unlike with @xmath86 , there is no guarantee of @xmath95 , especially after substituting in the unknown quantities ; 4 ) we demonstrate empirically in section [ subsec : simcompareest ] that , in finite samples , @xmath93 and @xmath76 are similar with regards to bias , but the latter always has lower mean squared error ( mse ) .",
    "+ it is interesting to point out that our discussion of choosing @xmath75 somewhat mirrors discussions regarding the two mainstream methods for dealing with bias in nonparametric regression procedures : undersmoothing @xcite and explicit bias correction @xcite . in estimator iii",
    ", one would be making an explicit bias correction , whereas adopting @xmath86 with @xmath89 is analogous to the approach of undersmoothing . by choosing estimator ii but keeping @xmath56",
    ", we actually promote a hybrid approach which balances the two .",
    "+ as a final note , with the general expression for the bias given by ( [ eqn : biaslogortilde ] ) and the asymptotic variance used for constructing ( [ eqn : logorhatci ] ) , we can derive an expression for the amise of the plug - in estimator @xmath65 .",
    "from there , it can be seen that , for the purpose of estimating the pointwise log odds ratio , the asymptotic optimal bandwidth should be @xmath52 , same as the order of the optimal bandwidth when estimating the functions @xmath9 themselves .",
    "this offers theoretical justification for using a _ single _ undersmoothed bandwidth @xmath56 all over .",
    "we conduct a simulation study to compare the three estimators shown in table [ tab : threeest ] in terms of their bias and mse .",
    "we also compare them to two model - based estimators : 1 ) an estimate of @xmath70 based on the logistic regression of equation ( [ eqn : logreg ] ) , and given by @xmath16 ; 2 ) an estimate based on fitting the gam model ( [ eqn : gammodel ] ) .",
    "the was done using the ` mgcv ` package in ` r ` @xcite .",
    "three simulation models were designed : @xmath96 \\\\ p_{1.}(x ) = 0.07e^{-x^2 } + 0.47   & \\qquad   p_{.1}(x ) = 0.1/(1+e^x ) + 0.45 \\\\",
    "p_{11}(x ) = p_{1.}(x)p_{.1}(x ) + \\delta(x )   & \\qquad   p_{12}(x ) = p_{1.}(x)p_{.2}(x ) - \\delta(x )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the density of a normal distribution with mean @xmath99 and variance @xmath100 .",
    "the above design can be interpreted as follows : if @xmath101 , then @xmath102 and thus @xmath103 .",
    "the delta function controls the degree of local association , as shown in figure [ fig : truesimor ] , which depicts the true log odds ratios curves for the three models .",
    "the design of our models , in particular our choices of @xmath104 , are such that the shapes of @xmath70 are representative of commonly encountered non - linear relative risk functions in epidemiology @xcite , whilst encompassing a realistic range of values .",
    "+ we assessed performance using empirical integrated absolute bias and mse , calculated by first working out the pointwise absolute bias and mse in increments of 0.05 from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , then averaging over all the increments .",
    "it is essential to take the pointwise absolute bias i.e. , ignore the sign , so that when averaging to produce the integrated bias , these values do not cancel each other out due to symmetry . also , even though the full support of @xmath20 is from -2 to 2 , we limit ourselves to the interval ( -1.75,1.75 ) to avoid boundary bias @xcite .",
    "sample sizes @xmath107 were considered , with 4000 simulated datasets for each @xmath108 .",
    "+ for the nonparametric estimators i - iii , a gaussian kernel was used with bandwidth selected via direct plug - in @xcite plus `` manual '' undersmoothing ( multiplying the optimal bandwidth by @xmath109 so as to get a bandwidth proportional to @xmath110 , as it is commonly done ) . strictly speaking ,",

    "estimator i performed poorly at the two smaller sample sizes ( tables [ tab : intbias]-[tab : intmse ] ) . by amending the estimated probabilities as in estimators ii and iii ,",
    "the integrated bias was significantly reduced ( table [ tab : intbias ] ) .",
    "expectedly , estimator iii produced the smallest integrated bias in most configurations , although estimator ii also performed quite competitively .",
    "+ a major problem suffered by estimator iii was that sometimes the estimates of the odds ratio turned out to be negative . in model b at @xmath112",
    ", there were 1361 cases ( out of @xmath113 ) where @xmath114 .",
    "this occurrence of negative values was not resolved at larger sample sizes e.g. , in model c at @xmath115 , there remained 105 cases of invalid estimates .",
    "in contrast , estimator ii can not suffer from this problem , obviously .",
    "+ the shape of the true log odds ratio curves in models b - c ( see figure [ fig : truesimor ] ) meant there was a clear mis - specification of mean structure in fitting ( [ eqn : logreg ] ) .",
    "therefore , the glm - based estimator suffered from inflated bias even at large @xmath108 ( table [ tab : intbias ] ) . in contrast , the flexibility of kernel regression allowed estimators ii and iii to perform much better than its parametric counterpart .",
    "the performance of the gam - based estimator was somewhere in between the glm model and the kernel - based estimators ii and iii .",
    "this is expected , given the ` hybrid ' nature of the gam - based estimator between the purely linear - logistic expression in ( [ eqn : logreg ] ) and the entirely nonparametric kernel - based methods .",
    "+ although its bias was higher compared to estimators ii and iii , the glm - based estimator performed best with regards to mse in model a. we found however that this was largely due to the inadequacy of using the direct plug - in method @xcite to select the bandwidth for nw regression . for relatively flat functions like model",
    "a , direct plug - in often leads to significant undersmoothing @xcite . to investigate this , we re - calculated nonparametric estimators i - iii in model a , using the same 4000 simulated datasets at each @xmath108 , but this time estimating @xmath42 via cross - validation @xcite .",
    "results showed that for all three nonparametric estimators , there was a sizable decrease in integrated mse ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "moreover , the decrease is such that estimator ii actually had a lower integrated mse than both the logistic regression and gam estimators at all four sample sizes . comparing cross - validation and direct plug - in",
    ", we found that the average @xmath42 based on the former was roughly five times larger than for the latter .",
    "+ for models b - c , estimator ii had the lowest mse for all sample sizes ( table [ tab : intmse ] ) .",
    "although estimator iii marginally outperformed ii with regards to integrated bias ( table [ tab : intbias ] ) , the complexity and additional variability resulting from @xmath93 meant that it was the latter which had the lower mse .",
    "+ in conclusion , the simulation results presented here lead us to recommend using @xmath76 as a preferred estimator of the pointwise log odds ratio .",
    "unless stated otherwise , future references to @xmath75 will admit the definition @xmath86 only .",
    "given the strategy of adding that small value @xmath75 to the conditional probabilities , a first attempt at constructing confidence limits based on @xmath76 would be to adjust ( [ eqn : logorhatci ] ) in an analogous manner , @xmath116 the form above is simple to work with , and parallels the variance formula discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1.1 ) for @xmath78 in ( [ eqn : globaloradjest ] ) .",
    "however , although we expect this to work better than ( [ eqn : logorhatci ] ) , the use of resampling methods may offer even further improvements on this asymptotic result in regards to coverage probability and/or interval width @xcite .",
    "therefore we explore this below .",
    "we also recognize that the delta method could have been applied directly to @xmath76 , but we found this led to a very complex formula for the asymptotic variance , and so have avoided it here .",
    "+ to obtain bootstrap based confidence intervals , we propose a new resampling procedure called the multinomial-1 bootstrap , inspired by some ideas in @xcite and developed in @xcite .",

    "two requirements need to be satisfied : 1 ) the bootstrapped response variables @xmath120 must be binary and satisfy @xmath121 ; 2 ) we must capture the conditional nature of the probabilities @xmath122 .",
    "the multinomial-1 bootstrap therefore works by the following : first , estimate @xmath37 with ( [ eqn : phatij ] ) using a pilot bandwidth @xmath123 ( instead of @xmath42 ) to obtain the vector @xmath124 . then for @xmath119",
    ", we simulate a bootstrap response vector @xmath125 from @xmath126 having obtained the bootstrap sample @xmath127 , we re - perform kernel regression using the previous @xmath56 to obtain @xmath128 and hence the vector @xmath129 .",
    "use of an initial oversmoothed @xmath123 is typical when bootstrap is used in nonparametric regression ( see for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is necessary to properly account for the bias inherent in kernel regression .",
    "a pilot bandwidth @xmath130 has been proved to be optimal in that purpose , and this is also what we will use in this work . by extending the theory of @xcite , it may be shown that the multinomial-1 bootstrap produces a consistent estimator of @xmath76 ( see appendix [ app : proofs ] ) .",
    "percentile bootstrap confidence intervals based on @xmath70 are thus obtained by generating a sufficiently large number of bootstrapped datasets , and calculating @xmath131 and @xmath68 quantiles of @xmath132 . denoting these quantiles by @xmath133 and @xmath134",
    "respectively , a @xmath135 bootstrap confidence interval for @xmath70 is given by @xmath136",
    "we compare the three confidence intervals for @xmath70 , as represented by ( [ eqn : logorhatci ] ) , ( [ eqn : logortildeci ] ) and ( [ eqn : bootlogortildeci ] ) , in terms of their empirical coverage probability ( ecp ) and mean length ( on a log scale ) .",
    "ecp is defined as the number of times the true pointwise log odds ratio lies within the generated cis ( nominated level 95% ) , divided by the total number of replications .",
    "we used models a - c established in section [ subsec : simcompareest ] , with @xmath137 and 1000 simulated datasets for each @xmath108 .",

    "the results are shown in table [ tab : ecp ] .",
    "+ for all three models , the delta method procedure based on the plug - in estimator i ( dm - i ) lead to conservative cis i.e. , high ecp for @xmath141 and 100 .",
    "dm - i also had the widest confidence intervals for all sample sizes .",

    "+ applying the delta method to @xmath76 ( dm - ii ) lead to cis with much smaller interval lengths , without any consistent decrease in ecp .",
    "the bootstrap percentile cis ( m1b - ii ) performed best , having almost always the smallest interval lengths with similar ecp . for locations where @xmath70 was substantially different from 0 e.g. , model b @xmath142 and model c at @xmath143 , bootstrap based intervals offered useful decreases in average ci length without being further away from the nominated 95% coverage probability . specifically , while the delta method intervals tended to have ecp @xmath144 95% , the bootstrap cis often have coverage slightly below 95% .",
    "this could be blamed in the name of conservatism , however , the _ absolute _ deviations from the targeted level 95% were very similar between the two methods . for @xmath145 , both dm - ii and m1b - ii performed equally well with regards to ecp and interval width .",
    "we illustrate the application of the methods developed to the icu dataset discussed in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "we are interested in exploring how the strength and direction of the association between patient survival following hospital discharge and type of admission varies with the age of the patients . to begin , a pearson @xmath146 test on table [ tab : application ] provided strong evidence against global independence ( @xmath147-value = 0.001 ) , and the global odds ratio estimate @xmath148 indicated that the odds of dying from an emergency admission was almost 9 times that for an elective admission , and could be as high as 38 times ( 95% wald ci : [ 2.064;38.290 ] ) .",
    "although this conclusion is expected , it should be subject to further investigation , particularly in light of the hypothesis that the strength of this association may be weaker for young adults .",
    "+ we first approached this investigation using logistic regression , with results indicating the main effect of admission type was significant given age ( @xmath147-value @xmath149 0.001 ) .",
    "the interaction term between age and admission type however was not significant in this model ( @xmath147-value = 0.622 ) , meaning the odds ratio , despite being significantly greater than 1 ( @xmath150 ) , did not appear to vary with age . persisting with the interaction model ,",
    "the log odds ratio estimate actually shows a decline with increasing age ( figure [ fig : icu ] - solid line ) .",
    "we also fitted a gam model , with penalized regression splines and penalty chosen via gcv , using the `` ` by ` '' argument available in the ` mgcv ` package @xcite .",
    "the resulting log odds ratio curve closely follows the fit from logistic regression ( figure [ fig : icu ] - dotted line ) . + as an alternative to model - based approaches , we decided to use the pointwise log odds ratio estimated using @xmath76 ( estimator ii in table [ tab : threeest ] ) .",
    "the result plotted as the dashed curve in figure [ fig : icu ] .",
    "from ages 50 and 86 , @xmath76 hovered around 2.5 which , in reasonable agreement with logistic regression , provided strong evidence for the odds of death for patients discharged from an emergency admission being significantly higher than those released from elective admission .",
    "however , for ages less than 50 , @xmath76 drops to become non - significant .",
    "this is in contrast to both the logistic regression and gam models which were not able to provide any notion of this dampening . + to further verify whether this decrease is substantiated , 95% pointwise bootstrap confidence intervals ( @xmath140 ) were calculated at ages 30 , 50 and 70 . at both ages 50 ( ci : [ 1.607;4.157 ] ) and 70 ( ci : [ 0.260;3.076 ] ) the limits were above 0 , and confirmed that for older patients the odds of death was significantly higher for patients admitted for emergency reasons .",
    "however , for age 30 ( ci : [ -1.633;1.394 ] ) the confidence interval contains @xmath103 , and indicated that for younger patients , there is no strong evidence to suggest type of admission into icu affects the odds of survival .",
    "in this paper , we developed a new measure of local association by extending the standard odds ratios using conditional probabilities , and estimating these probabilities nonparametrically using kernel regression to allow maximum flexibility .",
    "three estimators of @xmath70 were proposed , from which we recommend the amended estimator @xmath76 , which is both simple to calculate and has good bias / mse properties .",

    ", there is no single best method of selecting the bandwidth .",
    "the direct plug - in method tends to perform well for estimating the functions @xmath9 in practice in many cases @xcite , which is why we chose it for this work . however , there is no real guarantee that it would perform as well for estimating our pointwise log odds ratio .",
    "consequently , further studies need to be conducted evaluating various approaches of choosing @xmath42 in this very setting . indeed , the results from the first simulation in section [ subsec : simcompareest ] provide clear evidence that a thorough comparison of the various methods in selecting @xmath42 is necessary .",
    "+ in the future , we hope to develop model - free nonparametric association measures beyond the pointwise odds ratio e.g. , pointwise relative risk , pointwise kendall s tau and so on . how confidence intervals can be established for these quantities",
    "is also of interest .",
    "finally , the use of kernel regression means that due to the curse of dimensionality , it is inefficient to produce a pointwise odds ratio which is ` local ' with respect to many covariates .",
    "perhaps the use of semi - parametric methods e.g. , single index models , to estimate the conditional probabilities instead can overcome this problem .",
