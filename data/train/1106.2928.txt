    "recently , great attention has been paid to the investigation of the qcd phase diagram in terms of baryonic as well as isotopic ( isospin ) chemical potentials .",
    "the reason is that dense baryonic matter which can appear in heavy - ion collision experiments has an evident isospin asymmetry .",
    "moreover , the dense hadronic / quark matter inside compact stars is in general also expected to be isotopically asymmetric . to describe the above mentioned realistic situations , i.e.",
    "when the baryonic density is comparatively low , usually different nonperturbative methods or effective theories such as chiral effective lagrangians and especially nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) type models @xcite are employed . in this way",
    "the qcd phase diagram including chiral symmetry restoration @xcite , color superconductivity ( csc ) @xcite , and charged pion condensation ( pc ) phenomena @xcite were investigated under heavy - ion experimental and/or compact star conditions , i.e. in the presence of such external conditions as temperature , chemical potentials and possible external ( chromo)magnetic fields ( see the above references ) .",
    "moreover , it was also realized in the framework of njl - type models that different finite size factors , i.e. curvature or nontrivial spacetime topology as well as a finite spatial volume of a system , can significantly change the properties of both the chiral- and color superconductivity phase transitions .",
    "this conclusion is the result of chiral symmetry breaking investigations in weakly curved spaces @xcite and in spaces with nontrivial topology , where one or more space coordinates are compactified @xcite .",
    "in addition , the properties of finite size normal quark matter droplets in the language of the mit - bag model were considered , e.g. , in the review @xcite .",
    "it was also noted that the position of the chiral critical end point of the qcd phase diagram , which could be investigated in heavy ion collision experiments , depends essentially on the size of a finite system @xcite .",
    "next , the effect of spaces with constant curvature or nontrivial topology on csc was studied in @xcite . in particular , there it was shown that in a restricted region the csc phenomenon might occur much easier than in an infinite one @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the stability of finite size quark matter droplets in the color - flavor locked phase was considered in the framework of a bag model using the so - called multiple expansion method @xcite . however , up to now we have only scarce information about the formation of the pion condensation phase in dense baryonic matter under the influence of finite - size effects ( see below ) .",
    "this fact is partially explained by the complexity of the problem arising from the necessity to introduce an additional isotopic chemical potential for the adequate description of quark matter with isospin asymmetry and , in particular , of the pc phenomenon .    obviously , the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional njl models depend on the cutoff parameter which is typically chosen of the order of one gev , so that the results of their usage are valid only at _ comparatively low energies , temperatures and densities ( chemical potentials)_. besides , there exists also a class of renormalizable theories , the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional chiral gross - neveu ( gn ) type models @xcite , model '' instead of `` chiral gn model '' for ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models with _ a continuous chiral symmetry _ , since the chiral structure of the lagrangian is the same as that of the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional njl model . ] that can be used as a laboratory for the qualitative simulation of specific properties of qcd at _ arbitrary energies_. renormalizability , asymptotic freedom , as well as the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( in vacuum ) are the most fundamental inherent features both for qcd and all gn type models . in addition , the @xmath7 phase diagram is qualitatively the same for the qcd and gn model @xcite ( here @xmath2 is the quark number chemical potential and @xmath8 is the temperature ) . note also that the gn type models are suitable for the description of physics in quasi one - dimensional condensed matter systems like polyacetylene @xcite .",
    "it is currently well understood ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) that the usual no - go theorem @xcite , which generally forbids the spontaneous breaking of any continuous symmetries in two - dimensional spacetime does not work in the limit @xmath9 , where @xmath3 is the number of colored quarks .",
    "this follows from the fact that in the limit of large @xmath3 the quantum fluctuations , which would otherwise destroy a long - range order corresponding to a spontaneous symmetry breaking , are suppressed by @xmath10 factors .",
    "thus , the effects inherent for real dense quark matter , such as color superconductivity ( spontaneous breaking of the continuous color symmetry ) or charged pion condensation ( spontaneous breaking of the continuous isospin symmetry ) might be simulated in terms of a simpler ( 1 + 1)-dimensional gn - type model , though only in the leading order of the large @xmath3 approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "finally , one should recall that both the chiral phase transition @xcite and color superconductivity @xcite were investigated in the framework of gn models with account of the nontrivial @xmath11 spacetime topology .",
    "in general , this paper is devoted to the consideration of the charged pion condensation phenomenon under the influence of finite - size effects .",
    "the problem was partially solved in @xcite , where pc was studied in the framework of the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional njl model in the einstein universe with a constant curvature and finite spatial volume , and in @xcite , where it was considered in the @xmath12 symmetric gn model in spacetime with nontrivial topology , i.e. on the @xmath0 manifold with compactified space coordinate , and in the assumption that @xmath9 . for technical simplifications , in those papers the quark chemical potential @xmath2 was assumed to be zero , i.e. the considerations were performed at nonzero isospin @xmath1 chemical potential only ( this situation corresponds to quark matter with zero baryon density ) .",
    "obviously , the considered problem deserves further , more detailed investigations , this time when both chemical potentials are nonvanishing , @xmath13 .",
    "this is physically motivated by the fact that quark matter , which might be created in heavy - ion collisions , has in general nonzero baryon- and isospin densities and must be investigated in the framework of a theory with nonzero @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , quark - matter lumps occupy a finite volume . hence , in this paper we study , for illustration , the pc phenomenon in a @xmath12 symmetric two - dimensional njl@xmath14 model with @xmath13 , when the spatial coordinate is compactified and @xmath9 . in particular , we shall demonstrate that the finite size of the system promotes the appearance of the pc phenomenon in dense baryonic matter .",
    "we hope that the results of such a study of a renormalizable two - dimensional model may provide an additional stimulus for further investigations of the charged pc phenomenon in more realistic models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive , in the leading order of the large @xmath3-expansion , the expression for the thermodynamic potential of the two - flavored massless njl@xmath14 model with quark number chemical potential @xmath2 and isospin chemical potential @xmath1 for zero temperature in @xmath15- and in @xmath0 spacetimes.then , in section iii the phase structure of the model is investigated both at a finite value of @xmath5 and at @xmath16 , where @xmath5 is the radius of the @xmath6 circumference .",
    "finally , section iv presents a summary and some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional njl@xmath14 model to mimic the phase structure of real dense quark matter with two quark flavors ( u and d quarks ) .",
    "its lagrangian has the form : @xmath17q+\\frac{g}{n_c}\\left[(\\overline{q}q)^2+(\\overline{q}\\mathrm{i}\\gamma^5 \\vec\\tau q)^2 \\right ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where each quark field @xmath18 is a flavor doublet @xmath19 or @xmath20 and color @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , it is a two - component dirac spinor ( in ( [ 2lagrgn1 ] ) the summation over flavor , color , and spinor indices is implied ) ; @xmath22 are pauli matrices .",
    "the quark number chemical potential @xmath2 in ( [ 2lagrgn1 ] ) is responsible for the nonzero baryonic density of quark matter , whereas the isospin chemical potential @xmath1 is taken into account in order to study properties of quark matter at nonzero isospin densities ( in this case the densities of @xmath23 and @xmath24 quarks are different ) .",
    "the dirac gamma matrices in two - dimensional spacetime have the following form : @xmath25    let us consider the symmetries of the lagrangian . if @xmath26 , the lagrangian ( [ 2lagrgn1 ] ) is not only @xmath27 symmetric , but also invariant under transformations of the chiral @xmath28 group .",
    "however , if @xmath29 , the latter symmetry is reduced to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the third component of the isospin operator ( here and above the subscripts @xmath32 mean that the corresponding groups only act on left- and right - handed spinors , respectively ) . obviously , this symmetry can also be presented as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a vector isospin subgroup , and @xmath35 is an axial isospin subgroup .",
    "quarks are transformed under these subgroups as , respectively .    the linearized version of lagrangian ( [ 2lagrgn1 ] ) , which contains composite bosonic fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 , has the following form : @xmath38q-\\frac{n_c}{4g}\\left[\\sigma\\sigma+\\pi_a\\pi_a\\right ] .",

    "furthermore , it is clear from ( [ bosons ] ) that the bosonic fields are transformed under the isospin @xmath40 and axial isospin @xmath41 subgroups in the following manner : @xmath42    to avoid the no - go theorem , which forbids the spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries in the considered case of one space dimension , we restrict the discussion only to the leading order of the large @xmath3 expansion ( i.e. to the case @xmath43 ) , where this theorem is not valid @xcite . in particular , the effective action @xmath44 $ ] can be found in this approximation through the relation : @xmath45}=\\int [ d{\\overline q}][dq ] e^{\\mathrm{i}\\int d^2x { \\mathscr{l}}_{\\sigma,\\pi } } .\\end{split}\\ ] ] carrying out the gaussian - type path integration in ( [ 2seff1 ] ) over fermion fields , we obtain @xmath46}=e^{-\\mathrm{i}\\frac{n_c}{4g}\\int d^2x ( \\sigma^2+\\pi_a^2 ) } \\det \\mathrm{d}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] in ( [ 2seff2 ] ) we have used the notation @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the unit operator in the @xmath3-dimensional color space and @xmath49 then using the general formula @xmath50 and taking the logarithm of ( [ 2seff2 ] ) , one obtains the following expression for the effective action in the leading order of the @xmath10-expansion : @xmath51 where the @xmath52-operator stands for the trace in spinor ( s ) , flavor ( f ) , and two - dimensional coordinate ( x ) spaces , respectively ( the trace in color ( c ) space , obviously , equals @xmath3 ) .",
    "starting from ( [ 2seff3 ] ) , one can define the thermodynamic potential ( tdp ) of the model at zero temperature @xmath53 in the mean - field approximation , i.e. in the leading order of the @xmath10-expansion @xcite : @xmath54 where the mean fields @xmath55 and @xmath56 are @xmath57independent quantities , and in the round brackets of ( [ 2omega1 ] ) just the momentum space representation @xmath58 of the dirac operator @xmath59 appears .- dependent mean fields describing chiral density waves @xcite . for the following investigation of finite - size effects",
    "we restrict us , however , for simplicity , to the case of constant fields .",
    "] obviously , @xmath60 , where summation over all four eigenvalues @xmath61 of the @xmath62 matrix @xmath63 is implied and @xmath64 hence , @xmath65\\times[(p_0+\\mu)^2-\\varepsilon_-^2]\\},\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 it is clear that the tdp @xmath67 is symmetric under the transformations @xmath68 and/or @xmath69 . so it is sufficient to consider only the region @xmath70 , @xmath71 . taking into account this constraint and integrating in ( [ 2omega2 ] ) ,",
    "one obtains the following expression for the tdp of the system : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the heaviside step function . to simplify the task ,",
    "let us note that both the quasiparticle energies ( [ epsilon ] ) and hence the tdp ( [ 2omega3 ] ) depend effectively only on two combinations @xmath74 and @xmath75 of the bosonic fields , which are invariants with respect to the @xmath33 group , as is easily seen from ( [ inv ] ) . in this case , without loss of generality , one can put @xmath76 , and study the thermodynamic potential ( [ 2omega3 ] ) tdp as a function of only two variables , @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    ". then the tdp has the following form : @xmath79 where @xmath80    since we are going to study the phase diagram of the initial njl@xmath14 model , the system of gap equations is needed : @xmath81 the coordinates @xmath82 and @xmath83 of the global minimum point ( gmp ) of the tdp ( [ 2omega4 ] ) provide two order parameters ( gaps ) , which are proportional to the ground state expectation values @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . in this case",
    "the gap @xmath82 is just a dynamical quark mass . obviously , the pair of gaps @xmath82 and @xmath83 is a solution of the system ( [ gapeq ] ) .",
    "so , the gmp of the form @xmath86 corresponds to the phase , in which the initial @xmath87 symmetry remains intact . if @xmath88 in the gmp , then the @xmath89 symmetric phase is realized in the model .",
    "finally , the gmp of the form @xmath90 corresponds to the @xmath91 symmetric phase , where charged pions are condensed and isospin symmetry , @xmath89 , is broken spontaneously .",
    "( note that due to the zero value of the bare quark mass in the lagrangian ( 1 ) , the gmp of the form @xmath92 does not appear for the tdp ( [ 2omega4 ] ) . ) on the basis of the gaps @xmath82 and @xmath83 the following quantities can be introduced , @xmath93 which are the energies of @xmath23- , @xmath24- , @xmath94- , @xmath95-quasiparticles ( quarks ) or one - fermion excitations of the corresponding phase .",
    "the quantities @xmath96 from ( [ displaw ] ) are the energies necessary for creation of @xmath23 and @xmath24 quarks with momentum @xmath97 , whereas @xmath98 are the energies necessary for annihilation of @xmath94 and @xmath99 antiquarks .",
    "it is clear that the tdp ( [ 2omega4 ] ) is an ultraviolet divergent quantity , so one should renormalize it , using a special dependence of the bare quantities , such as the bare coupling constant @xmath100 , on the cutoff parameter @xmath101 ( @xmath101 restricts the integration region in the divergent integrals , @xmath102 ) .",
    "the detailed discussion of this procedure was performed , for example , in papers @xcite .",
    "the main stages of it are the following .",
    "first , we transform the expression for the tdp ( [ 2omega4 ] ) , @xmath103 the integral in the above expression is convergent and @xmath104 looks like @xmath105 second , it is evident that the effective potential ( [ k1 ] ) , is usually called effective potential . ]",
    "is a divergent quantity .",
    "so , to renormalize it we cut the integration region in ( [ k1 ] ) , @xmath102 , and require the bare coupling constant @xmath106 to have the following form @xmath107 then in the limit @xmath108 one can obtain a finite , i.e. renormalized , expression for @xmath104 : @xmath109 . \\end{split}\\ ] ] since @xmath110 might be considered as a free model parameter , it follows from ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 2v01 ] ) that the renormalization procedure of the njl@xmath14 model is accompanied by the dimensional transmutation phenomenon . indeed , in the initial unrenormalized expression ( [ k1 ] ) for @xmath104 the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath111 is present , whereas after renormalization the effective potential ( [ 2v01 ] ) is characterized by a dimensional free model parameter @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , as it is clear from ( [ 2v01 ] ) , the global minimum point of the affective potential @xmath104 lies just at the point @xmath112 .",
    "so in vacuum , the chiral @xmath113 symmetry of the njl@xmath14 model ( 1 ) is always spontaneously broken and the quantity @xmath110 might be treated as a dynamical quark mass ( in vacuum ) .    now , taking into account the expression ( [ 2v01 ] ) for @xmath104 , we see that the tdp ( [ 2omega5 ] ) is a finite renormalization invariant quantity which describes the properties of dense and isotopically asymmetric quark matter in an infinite volume .    for the further analysis",
    "we need also the expressions for the quark number density @xmath114 and isospin density @xmath115 in the phase with gaps @xmath82 and @xmath83 which follow directly from ( [ 2omega5 ] ) , @xmath116      since physical effects generally take place in a restricted space region , in the present paper we are going to study the influence of a finite size of the system ( at zero temperature ) on the thermodynamical properties of dense and isotopically asymmetric quark matter . to simulate a real situation",
    ", we put our ( 1 + 1)-dimensional system with lagrangian ( [ 2lagrgn1 ] ) into a restricted space region of the form @xmath117 ( here @xmath118 is the space coordinate ) .",
    "then a corresponding modification of the tdp ( [ 2omega5 ] ) is needed .",
    "it is well - known that such a constraint on any physical system is equivalent to its investigation in a spacetime with nontrivial topology in which space coordinates are compactified . in our case it means that we can consider the model ( 1 ) in spacetime with the topology @xmath0 and with quantum fields satisfying some boundary conditions of the form @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the length of the circumference @xmath6 , and the variable @xmath118 means the path along it .",
    "below , we shall use only two values of the parameter @xmath121 for a periodic boundary condition and @xmath122 for the antiperiodic one .    as a consequence , to obtain the tdp @xmath123 of the initial system placed in the restricted domain @xmath117 and at nonzero chemical potentials @xmath124 , one must simply replace the integration in ( [ 2omega5 ] ) and ( [ k1 ] ) by an infinite series , according to the rule : @xmath125 as a result , we obtain for the corresponding tdp @xmath126 in the spacetime of the form @xmath11 the following expression @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 . \\label{a9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath131 is the euler constant . the expression ( [ a9 ] ) is the generalization of the vacuum effective potential ( [ 2v01 ] ) in the spacetime with trivial @xmath15-topology to the case of spacetime with nontrivial topology of the form @xmath0 ( the detailed derivation of ( [ a9 ] ) is presented in appendix of @xcite ) . for further discussion",
    ", we need also the expression for the quark number density @xmath132 in the @xmath0 spacetime , which can be easily obtained from the tdp ( [ 2omega6 ] ) , @xmath133 moreover , in what follows it will be convenient to use the dimensionless quantities : @xmath134",
    "in the present section we shall study the phase structure of the njl@xmath14 model ( 1 ) depending on three external parameters , @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( [ not ] ) in the case @xmath53 . in general , this first means that for each fixed values of @xmath135 and @xmath136 we should study the global minimum point of the tdp @xmath137 as a function of @xmath138 ( or dimensionless variables @xmath139 ( [ not ] ) ) and then indicate the symmetry group of this point .",
    "secondly , we must divide the three - dimensional space @xmath140 into regions ( phases ) , where each of them is composed by the points corresponding to the same symmetry group of the tdp global minimum point . since this is a rather difficult problem",
    ", one can use an equivalent way . instead of studying",
    "the above mentioned three - dimensional phase diagram , we will slice it into the planes @xmath141 and then perform the above procedure only in the planes labeled by some values of @xmath136 .",
    "( of course , the more values of @xmath136 are taken into consideration , the more exact is the obtained picture about the phase structure of the model . )",
    "let us begin our study of the @xmath143-phase diagram of the model ( 1 ) starting from the plane @xmath144 ( @xmath4 ) that corresponds to the spacetime of trivial topology @xmath15 .",
    "in this case the numerical investigations of the global minimum point ( gmp ) properties of the tdp ( [ 2omega5 ] ) bring us to the following phase structure of the model shown in fig .",
    "1 . there , in the corresponding ( @xmath145)-plane , one can see four phase regions denoted by pc as well as by the roman figures i , ii and iii , respectively .    in the region denoted by pc ,",
    "i.e. in the charged pion condensation phase , each point @xmath146 corresponds to the gmp of the form @xmath147 .",
    "hence , everywhere in this phase the relation @xmath148 is valid , since @xmath149 . as a result",
    ", we see from ( [ displaw ] ) that all quasiparticles are gapped in the pc phase , i.e. a finite amount of energy is needed to create both @xmath23- and @xmath24-quarks .",
    "moreover , it is easily seen from ( [ density22 ] ) that the quark number density @xmath114 is identically zero in this phase .",
    "in contrast , the isospin density @xmath115 is nonzero and equal to @xmath150 at each of the pc phase points .",
    "then , let us observe the properties of phases denoted by i , ii , iii .",
    "at each point of these phases the gap @xmath151 , but the gap @xmath152 appears only in the phases i and iii . as a result , in regions i and iii the chirally @xmath33-symmetric phase with massless quarks is arranged .",
    "contrary , in the region ii , where the order parameter @xmath153 is nonzero , this symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the isospin @xmath154 subgroup . in this region the order parameter @xmath153 is a smooth function vs @xmath155 and @xmath156 and tends to zero when @xmath155 and @xmath156 tend to infinity ( @xmath157 when @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) .",
    "we call this phase the normal quark matter phase , since here quarks dynamically acquire a mass which is equal to the order parameter @xmath153 ( multiplied by @xmath110 ) , and space parity is not broken .",
    "note also that the upper and lower boundaries of the region ii tend asymptotically to the line @xmath160 from the upper- and lower sides , respectively . in the regions",
    "i and iii , as it follows from ( [ density22 ] ) , the quark number density is @xmath161 and the isospin density is @xmath162 .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the difference between i and iii phases .",
    "it is evident that in phases i and iii the dispersion relations ( [ displaw ] ) for quasiparticles have the following simple form : @xmath163 therefore , it is easy to check that in phase i both @xmath23- and @xmath24- quasiparticles are gapless .",

    "our consideration was performed in the leading order of the large @xmath3-expansion .",
    "recall that the charged pc phenomenon was studied recently in the framework of some qcd - like effective theories such as njl - type models or chiral effective theories in usual ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of the pc phase with _",
    "nonzero baryon ( quark number ) density _ , which we have called the pcd phase , was predicted there without any confidence .",
    "indeed , for some values of model parameters ( the coupling constant @xmath111 and cutoff parameter @xmath101 , etc . ) the pcd phase is allowed by the njl - type models . however , for other physically interesting values of @xmath111 and @xmath101 the pcd phase is forbidden in the framework of these models @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the electric charge neutrality constraint is imposed , the pion condensation phenomenon depends strongly on the bare ( current ) quark mass values .",
    "in particular , it turns out that the pcd phase is forbidden in the framework of the njl - type models if bare quark masses reach the physically acceptable values of @xmath198 mev ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , recent investigations of the charged pion condensation phenomenon in terms of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional massive / massless njl@xmath14 model in @xmath15 spacetime shows that the pcd phase is also absent there @xcite ( see also sec .",
    "[ iiia ] of the present paper ) .    in this paper we have placed the njl@xmath14 system ( 1 ) into a restricted spatial region or , equivalently , in the spacetime with nontrivial topology of the form @xmath0 , where the space coordinate is compactified into a circumference of a finite length @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that at @xmath144 ( @xmath199 ) the @xmath200-phase diagram of the model contains _ the zero quark number density pc phase _ as well as two symmetric phases , where the initial symmetry of the model remains intact , and the phase ii with broken chiral symmetry ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . then , if @xmath184 , we have observed in the @xmath200-phase diagram a more physically interesting situation , since at periodic boundary conditions for quark fields and for rather small values of @xmath1 the pcd phase is realized there ( see figs 2 - 4 ) .",
    "so we may conclude that _ finite size promotes the appearence of the pc phase with nonzero baryonic density _ at least in the framework of the njl@xmath14 model ( 1 ) .",
    "this is one of the main results of our paper and we hope that such an effect also takes place in the more realistic case of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime .",
    "taking into account the fact that cooper pairing of quarks is also significantly facilitated at @xmath201 @xcite , it is reasonable to expect that finite size can affect key properties of any system in comparison with those obtained from the @xmath16 limit ( see , e.g. , the papers @xcite , where this point of view is also supported ) .    among other results of our paper , it is interesting to note that the chirally broken phase ii exists on the @xmath200-phase diagrams only at @xmath202 ( @xmath203 ) in the case of periodic ( antiperiodic ) boundary conditions .",
    "in contrast , the pc phase ( pcd phase in the case of periodic boundary conditions ) is realized at an arbitrary value of @xmath184 .    obviously , it would be also interesting to study the influence of finite - size effects on the existence of chiral density waves and on the pc phenomenon in some qcd - like models in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime .",
