    "significant variability in brightness over a few minutes to several hours ( less than a day ) is commonly known as microvariability , intra - night optical variability ( inov ) or intra - day variability .",
    "optical microvariability is a well known property of radio - loud ( rl ) active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , particularly of its blazar subclass ( e.g. , gupta et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) . over past two decades",
    "there have been rather extensive searches for this phenomenon in blazars , other types of rlqsos , and the far more numerous radio quiet quasars ( rqqsos ) ( e.g. , miller , carini & goodrich 1989 ; carini et al .",
    "1992 , 2007 ; gopal - krishna et al .  1993b , 2000 , 2003 ; de diego et al .  1998",
    "; romero , cellone & combi 1999 ; sagar et al .",
    "2004 ; stalin et al .  2004",
    "; montagni et al .  2006 ; goyal et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the case of blazars these studies have provided useful constraints on the relativistic jet based models that are used to explain the origin of the large variations that help define the category ( e.g. , marscher , gear & travis 1992 ; rani et al .",
    "since rqqsos lack jets of significant power and extent , the microvariability seen in them may arise from processes on the accretion disc itself , and thus could possibly be used to probe the properties of the discs ( e.g. , gopal - krishna , sagar & wiita 1993a ) .",
    "however , so far there has been a lack of systematic effort to exploit microvariability properties to understand the nature of the substantial quasar sub - class with broad absorption lines ( bals ) , the balqsos .",
    "these balqsos are agn characterized by the presence of strong absorption troughs in their optical spectra .",
    "they constitute about 1015 per cent of optically selected quasars ( e.g. , reichard et al .",
    "2003 ; hewett & foltz 2003 ) . the bals are attributed to material flowing outwards from the nucleus with velocities of 5000 to 50000 km s@xmath2 ( green et al .",
    "balqsos are classified mainly into two subclasses based on the material predominantly producing the bal troughs .",
    "high ionization bal quasars ( hibals ) have broad absorption from c iv , si iv , n v and o iv lines .",
    "about 10 per cent of balqsos also show , along with hibal features , broad absorptions from lower ionization lines such as mg ii or al iii ; these are called low - ionization bal quasars ( lobals ) .",
    "any complete model of quasars and agns needs to explain self - consistently a wide range of their observational properties which also include : the presence of other emission / absorption lines , the fraction of quasars showing broad absorption lines and the fraction among them showing continuum variability such as microvariability .",
    "carini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have compiled a sample of 117 radio - quiet objects that have been searched for their microvariability . of these , 47 are classified as seyfert galaxies , 64 as qsos , and 6 as balqsos . in their entire sample 21.4 per cent of the objects were found to exhibit microvariability , but among objects classified as seyfert galaxies , qsos and balqsos , microvariability was seen in 17 per cent , 23 per cent and 50 per cent , respectively ( carini et al .",
    "in addition , rabbette et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have noted that two radio - quiet balqsos displayed short term x - ray variability .",
    "the observed high fraction of microvariations in balqsos suggests that it might be worthwhile to expend more of the observing time devoted to microvariability on the balqso class if one wants to understand physical processes in or near the accretion disc .",
    "clearly , the present sample size of balqsos is very small compared to those of the non - balqso classes , and no useful conclusions about their nature can be drawn from them .",
    "therefore it is important to increase the sample of balqsos , so as to be able to arrive at firmer conclusions about the fraction showing microvariability .",
    "we note that if balqsos do really show a substantially higher duty cycle for microvariability than do non - bal rqqsos , this would shed light on the question of whether or not radio - quiet balqsos are special cases of the rqqsos , especially in terms of their microvariability properties .",
    "for instance , if even weak jets dominate the rapid variability ( e.g. , gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2003 ) then a higher duty cycle for microvariability will give indirect support for the hypothesis that balqsos are viewed at angles nearly perpendicular to their accretion discs ( e.g. , ghosh & punsly 2007 ) .",
    "this is because jet fluctuations originating in relativistic jets pointing close to our line - of - sight are amplified in magnitude and compressed in timescale ( e.g. , gopal - krishna et al .",
    "whereas , if balqsos show only the usual low microvariability duty cycles of normal rqqsos ( around 20 per cent ) and the fluctuations still arise in weak jets , that would provide indirect support for alternative models , such as those where the bal outflows come out closer to the disc plane ( e.g. , elvis 2000 ) . in conjunction with x - ray and optical spectral properties ,",
    "such variation information is very useful in constraining various physical models for the origin of microvariability ( e.g. , czerny et al .",
    "2008 ) and the nature of balqsos itself ( e.g. , weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; elvis et al . 2000 ) . to address these questions ,",
    "we have recently started a pilot program to make an extensive search for optical microvariability of balqsos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the main aspects of our sample selection criteria , while section 3 briefly describes our observations and the data reductions . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we present our analysis and results , respectively .",
    "section 6 gives a discussion and our conclusions .",

    "this master bias frame was subtracted from all the twilight sky flat image frames as well as from the source image frames taken on that night .",
    "the routine step of dark frame subtraction was not performed because the ccds used in our observations were cryogenically cooled to @xmath5120@xmath28 c ; at that temperature the amount of thermal charge deposition is negligible for our brief exposure times .",
    "then the master flat was generated by median combining of several flat frames ( usually more than 5 taken on the twilight sky ) in that passband .",
    "next , the normalized master flat was generated .",
    "each source image frame was flat - fielded by dividing by the normalized master flat in the respective band to remove pixel - to - pixel inhomogeneities .",
    "finally , cosmic ray removal was done from all source image frames using the task _ cosmicrays _ in iraf .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of the comparison stars and the target source are obtained from the data by using dominion astronomical observatory photometry ( daophot ii ) software to perform the concentric circular aperture photometric technique ( stetson 1987 , 1992 ) .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out with four aperture radii , to wit , @xmath0 1@xmath18fwhm , 2@xmath18fwhm , 3@xmath18fwhm and 4@xmath18fwhm .",
    "utmost caution has been taken to deal with the seeing , and we have taken the mean full width at half maximum @xmath29 of 5 fairly bright stars on each ccd frame in order to choose the apertures for the photometry of that individual frame .",
    "the data reduced with different aperture radii were found to be in good agreement .",
    "however , it was noticed that the best s / n was almost always obtained with aperture radii of 2@xmath18fwhm , so we adopted that aperture for our final analysis .",
    "the comparison stars are chosen on the basis of their proximity in both location and magnitude to the quasar .",
    "preference was given to those stars having magnitudes similar to that of the monitored quasar , so that the errors in the differential light curves ( dlcs ) will not be dominated by any faint object ( see sect .",
    "[ subs : stat ] ) .",
    "the locations of the two best comparison stars for each balqso are given in columns 25 of table  [ tab : color ] .",
    "in addition , our atmosphere acts like a colour filter of variable transparency , so the photometry of two stars ( or quasar - star pair ) of different colours will be affected by different amounts because of the changing air - mass during the monitoring ( e.g. , eq .  2 , in stalin et al .",
    "therefore , for ascertaining the variability properties from dlc , the colours of the two objects in the dlc really should be similar .",
    "we list v@xmath5r colour differences for all pairs of objects we observe in columns 911 of table  [ tab : color ] . for most of the quasar - star pairs the v@xmath5r colour differences are smaller than unity , except for seven pairs ( out of a total of 38 ) where the differences are the range of 1.01.20 .",
    "similarly , for the star - star pairs , the colour differences for all pairs are smaller than unity .",
    "stalin et al .  (",
    "2004 ) report a detailed investigation quantifying the effect of colour differences , and they show that the effect of colour differences of this amount on dlcs will be negligible for a specific band ( see also carini et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "we also used the star - star dlcs to identify any spikes in them ( unusually sharp rise or fall of the dlc over a single time bin ) , assuming that the true star - star dlc is overall non - variable or at worst reflects small stellar oscillations .",
    "such spikes may arise from improper removal of cosmic rays , cirrus clouds or some unknown instrumental cause .",
    "such outliers can sometimes significantly alter the nominal statistics on short - term variations , especially when dlcs do not have enough data points .",
    "we typically have @xmath030 individual temporal data points in our sample ; see table  [ tab : res ] , column 2 .",
    "we removed such outliers if they were more than 3@xmath30 from the mean , by applying a mean clip algorithm on the comparison star - star dlcs . in cases where we find any such outliers",
    "we have censored those time bin data points from our analysis of quasar - star dlcs as well .",
    "only dlcs once freed from any such outliers have been used for carrying out our statistical analysis of microvariability .",
    "however , we should stress that such outliers in our comparison star - star dlcs were usually not present and never exceeded two data points .",
    "to quantify microvariation of a dlc , by far the most commonly used statistic is the so - called @xmath31-statistic ( e.g. , jang & miller 1995 ; romero et al .",
    "this technique uses a variability parameter @xmath31 , which is an average of @xmath32 and @xmath33 with    @xmath34    here @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the variance of observational scatters of the differential instrumental magnitudes of the quasar@xmath5star1 , quasar@xmath5s2 and star1@xmath5star2 , respectively . the normally adopted criterion to claim that variability is present is @xmath38 , which corresponds to a nominal confidence level of @xmath39 .      despite the very common use of these @xmath31-statistics , de diego ( 2010 )",
    "has pointed out it has severe problems . because it considers the ratio of two standard deviations rather than of variances it does not describe a normally distributed variable and it is not properly centered with the mean expected value being zero ; hence it is not a good statistic and de deigo ( 2010 ) concludes that the nominal critical value for the presence of variability ( i.e. , 2.576 ) is usually too conservative .    another statistical method that can be used to quantify the presence of microvariability is the @xmath40-test , which has been recently been shown to be a more powerful and reliable tool for detecting microvariability ( de diego 2010 ) .",
    "the @xmath40 value is computed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the variances of the quasar - star1 , quasar - star2 and star1-star2 dlcs , respectively .",
    "these @xmath40 values are then compared individually with the critical @xmath40 value , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the significance level set for the test , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the degrees of freedom of the quasar - star and star - star dlcs , respectively .",
    "the smaller the @xmath46 value , the more improbable that the result is produced by chance",
    ". thus values of @xmath49 0.0001 , 0.001 or 0.01 ( the last assumed in our analysis ) roughly correspond to @xmath50 , 3@xmath30 or a 2.6@xmath30 detections , respectively .",
    "if @xmath40 is larger than the critical value , the null hypothesis ( i.e. , no variability ) is discarded .",
    "here we also note that having two f - values , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , allows us two choices in deciding the presence of variability : ( i ) to take the average of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and compare it with critical @xmath40 value ; ( ii ) to compare @xmath51 and @xmath52 separately with the critical @xmath40 value .",
    "we prefer the latter option , as it serves as further validation for the f - test ; for if one dlc indicates variability and one does nt , these mixed signals bring into question the reality of the putative variability .",
    "although the @xmath40-test is certainly better than the @xmath31-test , it should be noted that for the @xmath40-test to give a truly reliable result the error due to random noise in the quasar ",
    "star and star - star dlcs should be of a similar order , apart from any additional scatter in the quasar - star dlc due to possible qso variability .",
    "for instance , if both comparison stars are either brighter ( fainter ) than the monitored quasar , then a false alarm detection ( non - detection ) is possible due to the very small ( large ) photon noise variance of the star - star dlc compared to the quasar - star dlcs .",
    "this in practice can happen , as sometimes it is difficult to fulfill the desiderata of having non - variable comparison stars within the quasar ccd image frame that are very similar in magnitude to the qso .    in our sample",
    "we have tried to choose non - variable comparison stars in proximity to the magnitude of the quasar ( see sect .",
    "[ subs : stars ] ) , but it was not possible to fulfill this requirement for all quasars .",
    "so sometimes in performing the @xmath40-test we may have to compare the variance of star - star dlcs involving stars substantially brighter than the quasar , where scatter due to photon noise is very small , with the noisier quasar - star dlc .",
    "in such cases , the standard statistics of the @xmath40-test do seem to give too much weight to even very nominal fluctuations in a quasar - star dlc . a sensible way to deal with this real problem is to scale the star - star variance by a factor , @xmath53 , which is proportional to the ratio of the noise in the quasar - star and star - star dlcs .",
    "one logical choice along these lines is to consider the ratio of the average squared error in the quasar - star and star - star dlcs i.e. , @xmath54 \\equiv \\frac{\\langle\\sigma^2(q - s)\\rangle}{\\langle\\sigma^2(s1-s2)\\rangle } , \\label{eq : kappa}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are , respectively , the errors on individual points of the quasar - star and star - star dlcs , as returned by the daophot / iraf routine .",
    "then the scaled f - value , @xmath57 , can be computed as , @xmath58    here scaling the variance of the star - star dlc by @xmath53 basically amounts to normalizing the variance of the dlc by the mean of the squared errors of its individual points ( i.e. , by @xmath59 in eq .  [",
    "eq : kappa ] ) .",
    "this is sensible , as we know that for no intrinsic variability present in a light curve , the variance gives an estimate of the square of the mean errors ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) of the light curve .",
    "these @xmath59s of the light curves depend on the brightnesses of the observed objects , so to remove any effects of brightness on the variances ( used in the standard f - test as var(q@xmath5s1)/var(s1@xmath5s2 ) ) of light curves it should be better to use the variances that have been normalised by their @xmath59 values .    the value of scale factor , @xmath53 , used in the _ scaled _ f - test ( eq .  [ eq.fstest ] ) will be near unity if the quasar and stars are of similar magnitude , and as a result it will give a similar f - value as is given by the standard f - test ( see eq .",
    "[ eq.ftest ] ) . on the other hand , if both comparison stars are either brighter ( fainter ) than the monitored quasar , then @xmath53 will be larger ( smaller ) than unity . as a result",
    ", @xmath53 will reasonably scale the variance of comparison star - star dlcs for any magnitude difference between stars and quasar , and hence avoid the problem with the standard @xmath40-test which does seem to give too much weight to even very nominal fluctuations in a quasar@xmath5star dlc , when it is compared to brighter star@xmath5star dlcs .",
    "other alternatives to the standard f - test are the use of one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) or a @xmath60 test ( e.g. , de diego 2010 ) .",
    "for an appropriate use of anova the number of data points in the dlc needs to be large enough so as to have many points in each subgroup used for the analysis ; however , this is not possible for our observations as we typically have only around 30 data points in our light curves . for the appropriate use of a @xmath60 test ,",
    "the errors of individual data points need to have gaussian distributions and those errors should be accurately estimated .",
    "it has been claimed in the literature that errors returned by photometric reduction routines in iraf and daophot usually are underestimated , often by factors of 1.31.75 ( gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2003 ; sagar et al .",
    "2004 ; bachev et al .",
    "2005 ) , which makes the use of a @xmath60 test less desirable for such real photometric light curves .",
    "however , as our scale factor depends on the ratio of average squared errors , this possible caveat does not affect our scaled @xmath40-test analysis .    in conclusion",
    ", we propose that by applying such scaling to the variance of the star - star dlc we can perform a _ scaled _",
    "@xmath40-test , where our scale factor is designed so that it : ( i ) takes care of the difference in magnitude between the qso and star in quasar - star and star - star dlcs ; ( ii ) retains the requirement that both the variance being compared in a @xmath40-test should have a @xmath60 distribution , which is not the case in @xmath31-statistics ; and ( iii ) cancels out the problem of uncertain error underestimation by daophot / iraf routines reported by many other authors , in that our scaling factors depend on ratios of averaged squared errors .",
    "therefore we report our final results based on this scaled @xmath40-test .",
    "however it is also worthwhile to compute @xmath31-values and standard @xmath40-values to facilitate the comparison of results for variability based on them with those based on our newly proposed _ scaled _",

    "based on the @xmath31-test its dlc with respect to star1 shows it as a probable variable but with star2 as non - variable .",

    "[ fig : s05to10 ] by eye indicates that there is no variation that can defined coherently by more than 2 points .",
    "therefore , to exclude such questionable variability and to be on the conservative side for unambiguous microvariable detection , only those sources should be termed as variable for which both quasar - star1 and quasar - star2 dlcs mark the source as variable ( i.e ` v , v ' in table  [ tab : res ] ) .",
    "probably variable sources are taken as those for which either both the status are of probable variable ( i.e. , ` pv , pv ' in table  [ tab : res ] ) or one quasar - star dlc marks it as a probable variable and the other as a variable ( i.e. , ` pv , v ' or ` pv , v ' in table  [ tab : res ] ) .",
    "sources termed as non - variable ( ` nv ' ) are those for which at least one of the status based on quasar - star1 and quasar - star2 dlc marked them as non - variable ( i.e. , at least one ` nv ' status in table  [ tab : res ] ) .",
    "column ( 9 ) of table  [ tab : res ] indicates that the @xmath31-statistics shows two sources as variable and four as probably variable .",
    "the scaled @xmath40-test shows two sources as variable and six sources as probably variable . as we have discussed above ( in section  [ subsubs : fscaled ] ) , that scaled @xmath40-test is better for our work ( and probably also better in many observations made by others ) than the standard @xmath40-test due to differences between the magnitudes of the quasars and their comparison stars .",
    "this is also evident from column ( 10 ) of table  [ tab : res ] which shows that the standard @xmath40-test would give 13 sources as variable and two as a probably variable , indicating that this test certainly suffers from the problem related to small variances of the brighter star - star dlcs , at least for our sample of balqsos .    although the @xmath31-test and the _ scaled _",
    "@xmath40-test both give two sources as variable , it is not difficult to appreciate the scaled @xmath40-test merits over the @xmath31-test by taking specific examples . for instance , j120051.52@xmath10350831.6 is a balqsos with a @xmath31-value of 3.25 from quasar - star1 dlc and 3.24 from quasar - star2 dlc , which seems to make it a clear case of inov detection , particularly since the @xmath31-statistic is usually conservative .",
    "however , by looking at the dlcs for this source in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : s11to19 ] , it is clear even by eye that : ( i ) there is likely to have been a random fluctuation ( not a coherent one ) for the last 9 points of the dlcs ; and ( ii ) its comparison stars are about 1.5 mag brighter than this quasar , which makes the variance of the star - star dlc very small ( due to small photon noise ) . as a result",
    "the @xmath31-value will be artificially very high , leading to false detections .",
    "this flaw also crops up in the standard @xmath40-test , but is eliminated in the scaled @xmath40-test which termed this balqso as a non - variable source ( not even probably variable ) .",
    "another source , j120924.07@xmath10103612.0 , has a @xmath31-value of 3.37 from the quasar - star1 dlc and 3.06 from the quasar - star2 dlc but these are probably so high because of the @xmath01.2 mag brighter comparison stars ; however , this balqso also shows a coherent variability trend ( even by eye ) , and is also termed as variable by the scaled @xmath40-test .",
    "these empirical examples , and the fact that the scaled @xmath40-test detects two cases of unambiguous variability in comparison to the @xmath31-test which makes only one unambiguous detections ( after eliminating the false positive case mentioned above ) clearly shows that the scaled @xmath40-test , beside being more sensitive than the @xmath31-test to small amplitude variability , is also sufficiently robust to eliminate nearly any false alarm detections .",
    "therefore , finally , we rely on the result given by the scaled @xmath40-test , by which we find two unambiguous detections of microvariability in our sample of 19 balqsos up to an accuracy of 0.01 - 0.02mag ( see columns 9,10 , 11 and 13 of table  [ tab : res ] ) . as a result",
    ", our sample shows that about 10 - 11 per cent of balqsos ( i.e. , 2 out of 19 sources ) certainly showed microvariability ( at a confidence level of 0.99 ) .",
    "as noted in the introduction , there have been rather extensive examinations of the frequency of optical microvariability for rqqsos as well as blazars and other rlqsos .",
    "the typical duty cycle ( dc ) for blazars is 6065 per cent ( e.g. , gupta et al .",
    "2005 ) , while for normal quasars it has been found to be around 2025 per cent ( e.g. , carini et al .",
    "for both these classes the number of sources in each total sample was quite large , so these values should be reasonably reliable , and support the hypothesis that most of these rapid variations arise , or at least are amplified , in the relativistic jets ( e.g. , jang & miller 1995 ; gopal - krishna et al .",
    "the interesting class of radio - quiet balqsos was reported to have a 50 per cent dc but this sample had only 6 members ( carini et al .",
    "2007 ) . therefore ,",
    "one of the reasons for the difference in dc results could be poor statistics in the previous study and better statistics now with a sample about a factor of three larger .",
    "apart from sample size , some of the difference might be due to differences in the typical length of the observation .",
    "as long known , lengthier observations of blazars are more likely to reveal variability ( e.g. , carini 1990 ) , which was also later shown to be the case for rqqsos ( gupta et al .",
    "2005 , carini et al .",
    "carini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that rqqsos that were monitored for about 6 - 7 hr showed the highest fraction of microvariability , typically around 24 per cent . in the 4 hour observation range , which is where most of our observations fall ,",
    "less than 10 percent of sources were found to have microvariability .",
    "therefore the fact that we found about 10 - 11% dc for radio - quiet balqsos is in agreement with the results from the literature for other radio - quiet non - balqsos indicates that the bal nature does not have an effect on the presence of microvariability .",
    "in addition , as we discussed in sections  [ subs : stat ] and [ subsec : resvar ] , this dc fraction also depends on what statistical test has been used to decide on the significance of microvariation ( see de diego 2010 for details ) .",
    "most of these previous studies have used the @xmath31-test , which has been shown recently to be an unreliable and usually too conservative method to detect microvariation , when compared to proper statistics such as the @xmath40-test ( de diego 2010 ) .",
    "so , to allow comparison with earlier results , we also computed duty cycles ( dcs ) of balqsos in our sample using the @xmath31-test , which shows only one out of 19 source as variable ( excluding one false detection , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : resvar ] ) , resulting in a dc of about 5 per cent . as a result the dcs of all classes of agn may increase if their dlcs are analyzed with the scaled @xmath40-test rather than with the usually more conservative @xmath31-test , which , for the 4 hour observation range , were reported at less than 10 percent for rqqsos ( carini et al .",
    "2007 ) . therefore , after taking into account the observation length and the dependence on statistical test used , it seems that the dc of radio - quiet balqsos is likely to be of a similar value to the dc of non - bal rqqsos , but without redoing all past analyzes with the scaled @xmath40-test we can not be certain of this assertion .",
    "apart from this comparison using the @xmath31-test , all our final results and conclusions are based on the more reliable scaled @xmath40-test ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : resvar ] ) , which gives our new result of an approximately 11 per cent dc for radio - quiet balqsos .",
    "the phenomenon of microvariability was first noticed for blazars , and for them microvariability almost certainly arises from a relativistic jet .",
    "however , given the lower dcs for rq agn it is still unclear if the nature of intranight variability is the same in these objects , or if it arises from processes in the accretion disc itself ( e.g. , mangalam & wiita 1993 ; chakrabarti & wiita 1993 ) , and thus could possibly be used to probe the accretion disc ( e.g. , gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "recent modeling suggests that even for rqqsos , jet based models should be the most efficient way to produce microvariability ( e.g. , czerny et al .",
    "such jet - based models should predict a difference in equivalent widths of emission lines of variable and non - variable sources , as they should be smaller in the former , due to its dilution by jet components .",
    "however , recently this hypothesis was shown to be unlikely based on an analysis of spectra of a set of rqqsos that had already been searched for microvariability ( chand et al .",
    "some other possibilities include disc based models where variation can be due to : variable hard radiation from near the disc center that is reprocessed into the uv - optical region ( e.g. , ulrich et al .",
    "1997 ) ; instabilities in the accretion flow itself producing multiple hot - spots ( e.g. , mangalam & wiita 1993 ) ; disco - seismological modes within the disc ( e.g. nowak & wagoner 1991 , 1992 ) . in the first case above the variable hard radiation instead may also come from a hot corona above the accretion disc ( merloni & fabian 2001 ) .",
    "the shortest variability time scale in this scenario can be associated with the light - crossing time , which will be larger for higher central black hole masses ( e.g see bachev et al .",
    "2005 ) . in a scenario with instabilities in an accretion flow ,",
    "if one assumes that the inner part of the flow operates through an optically thin advective mode , then the border between it and outer thin disc may be good candidate for the region where these instabilities may occur ( e.g. , gracia et al .  2003 ; krishan , ramadurai & wiita 2003 ) .",
    "the time scale may also be associated with the much longer accretion time scale .",
    "observational estimation of such variability time scales could possibly be used to distinguish between above various disc based scenarios . however , for luminous qsos such as those in our sample that should have black hole masses in excess of @xmath98 m@xmath99 , even the fastest disc based time scale can be a few hours .",
    "as our monitoring of each source rarely exceeded 4 hours and was sometimes unevenly sampled , it is not possible for us to obtain reliable estimates of the variability time scales for the minority of variable sources .",
    "therefore we are not able to distinguish between the various disc based scenarios mentioned above , nor can we cleanly distinguish between jet based and disc based models .",
    "our larger sample ( a factor of three improvement ) of radio - quiet balqsos , aided by more robust detection criteria , have allowed us to conclude that the fraction of radio - quiet balqso showing microvariability are about 11% for an observation length of about 4 hr . this new dc of 11% is similar to the usual low microvariability fraction of normal rqqsos with observation length similar to our observation , though we note those dcs were obtained using the @xmath31-statistic and not our scaled @xmath40-test .",
    "this similarity in microvariability frequency provides some support for models where radio - quiet balqso do not appear to be a special case of the rqqsos .",
    "further extension this type of study to radio - loud balqsos will be important in obtaining good values for the microvariability percentage for all types of balqsos .",
    "such additional observations will also help in understanding that whether we are viewing balqsos closer to the disc plane or to the perpendicular to the disc .",
    "in the latter case higher dcs are expected assuming that the cause of microvariation is related to the relativistic jet .",
    "in addition , to investigate whether and how x - ray and optical microvariability are correlated in balqsos , it will be useful to carry out future simultaneous multi - color optical and x - ray monitoring observations ( e.g. , ramrez et al .",
    "2010 ) . finally , to ascertain whether or not such microvariation depends on spectral properties , additional optical and x - ray spectral analyses of the balqsos already searched for microvariability could place important constraints on the possible origin of such microvariations",
