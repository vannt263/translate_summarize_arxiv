    "there has been one firmly established class of variable sources in the high - energy @xmath0-ray sky .",
    "the energetic @xmath1-ray experiment telescope ( _ egret _ ) on the compton @xmath1-ray observatory discovered a population of variable @xmath0-ray blazars above 100 mev@xcite .",
    "however , _",
    "egret _ also left the legacy of a large fraction of unidentified sources in the 3eg catalog .",
    "many of these were found at low galactic latitudes and believed to be galactic in nature .",
    "_ egret _ established @xmath0-ray pulsars as a galactic population and these were thought to contribute to the unidentified sources .",
    "several studies found indications of variability in some of the sources along the galactic plane ( gp)@xcite , a behavior not expected of the pulsars , which are steady on these timescales . additionally , no blazar counterpart was identified in several cases .",
    "this suggested the possible existence of a new galactic @xmath0-ray class .",
    "several sources showed both strong variability and a convincing lack of a blazar within the _ egret _ localization errors , like 3egj0241 + 6103 , 3egj1824 - 1514 and groj1834 - 04 .",
    "one of these has emerged as a new type of @xmath0-ray source with the rediscovery of 3egj0241 + 6103 ( cos - b 2cg135 + 01 ) , which was associated , although the position was uncertain , with lsi@xmath2 , a \" prominent radio flaring star system  , high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) system at 2 kpc constituted of a b0ve star and a neutron star orbiting on an excentric orbit with a 26.5 days period .",
    "a daily / monthly variability was seen with _",
    "egret _ , but no periodicity detected@xcite .",
    "a tev source has then been detected by magic and then veritas , at this position , with a periodic signal modulated at the orbital period .",
    "_ fermi _ has detected a @xmath0-ray source , 0fglj0240.36113 , at the position ra=40.076",
    ", dec=61.233 with a 95% error radius of @xmath3 , consistent with the optical counterpart , and with a periodicity of @xmath4days , the emission peaking at the periastron , and a spectrum reminiscent of the pulsars , therefore definitely identifying in the mev - gev domain the first @xmath0-ray binary source with the hmxb system@xcite .",
    "the second interesting source is the case of 3egj1824 - 1514 , detected by _ egret _ , but without modulation , as spatially coincident with ls5039 , an hmxb constituted of a likely neutron star orbiting around an o6.5 star .",
    "hess detected a periodic signal modulated at the orbital period of 3.91 days .",
    "_ fermi _ firmly detected at more than @xmath5 a periodic source , modulated at @xmath6 days , in a complicated region with a very intense galactic diffuse emission .",
    "the most dynamic example from _ egret _ is groj1838 - 04 ( 3egj1837 - 0423 ) , which produced an intense outburst in june 1995@xcite .",
    "the flux above 100mev in a 3.5 day period was found to be a factor of 7 brighter than in later observations of the region .",
    "notably , no blazar counterpart is known within the 99% _ egret _ error contour .",
    "the absence of a flat spectrum radio source at the levels typical of the _ egret _ blazars made this a candidate for a different type of @xmath0-ray emitter .",
    "the proximity of such a unique outburst to the inner galaxy led to speculation of a possible galactic origin .",
    "the question of the progenitor of this activity remains as well as the broader question of the existence of similar sources of this type . as stated in ref .",
    ", `` other unidentified _ egret _ sources near the gp appear to be time variable with v@xmath7 '' in ref .  .",
    "finally , _ fermi _ has recently detected a variable high energy source coinciding with the position of the x - ray binary and microquasar cygnus x-3 , modulated at its short orbital period of 4.8 hours .",
    "cygnus x-3 is an hmxb system located at a distance of @xmath8kpc , with a compact object of nature still matter in the debate , orbiting a wolf - rayet star@xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) is very well suited for monitoring variability in the gev sky .",
    "the large effective area ( @xmath9@xmath10 on axis above 1gev ) , wide field - of - view ( @xmath11sr ) , and excellent angular resolution ( better than @xmath12 above 1gev ) greatly enhance the sensitivity to transient activity in comparison to previous @xmath0-ray instruments in this energy range .",
    "a notable departure from previous observations is that the energy range of the lat ( 20mev to @xmath13gev ) extends above that covered by _ egret_. the combination of the wide field - of - view with the sky scanning observational mode supplies coverage of the sky every @xmath14hours ( 2 orbits ) .",
    "this enables the detection of fainter objects in shorter intervals than previously possible .",
    "also , the localizations for sources above threshold are much better than @xmath12 even on short timescales . these capabilities are critical for triggering rapid multiwavelength follow - up observations of lat transients .",
    "the lat has so far detected three transient events near the gp that have not been associated with blazars . here",
    ", we report on the @xmath0-ray characteristics and the multiwavelength follow - up observations that were triggered shortly after the detections .",
    "all the unidentified transients were first detected by the lat automated science processing ( asp)@xcite . the asp flare search locates and analyzes detected point sources in the lat photon data as these become available for processing on the ground .",
    "the search runs on 6-hour , 1-day , and 1-week intervals .",
    "the latency between the time the data are acquired and when they are available for ground processing is short enough to allow alerts to be communicated and follow - up multi - wavelength observations triggered within a day .",
    "the lat team continuously monitors the output of the automated searches for new source detections and flares from known lat sources .",
    "the automated processing reports candidate locations and flux estimates , a summary is given in weekly reports in _",
    "the transients presented here are high - confidence detections that appeared in multiple 6 hour and daily asp searches .",
    "lat observations on 6 october 2008 revealed a newly detected lat source spatially associated with 3egj0903 - 3531@xcite in the 3eg catalog@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] left panel ) . the preliminary localization ( j2000.0 : ra@xmath15 , dec@xmath16 , @xmath17",
    "; this is a correction to the originally reported atel value ) was based on one day of observations .",
    "additional analysis demonstrated the source was detected ( ts@xmath18 , @xmath19 ) on 5 , 6 , and 7 october 2008 before falling below the daily sensitivity threshold for this region .",
    "the lat flux ( e@xmath20mev ) reported for the flare exceeded @xmath21photons@xmath22s@xmath23 , which is about a factor of 5 greater than the _ egret _ flux , and the source brightened by a factor of 15 in 3 days . despite being bright over several days",
    ", this source did not exceed the @xmath24 criteria for the lat bright source list@xcite , which includes data from 4 august 2008 through 30 october 2008 .",
    "this source was first detected on 15 october 2008@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] middle panel ) .",
    "it appears in the lat bright source list as 0fglj0910.2 - 5044@xcite and is flagged as variable . the preliminary localization , ( j2000.0 : ra , dec@xmath25 , @xmath26 , r68@xmath27 ) , is based on one day of data and only accounts for statistical errors .",
    "the reported flux above 100mev exceeded @xmath21photons@xmath22s@xmath23 .",
    "the bright source list analysis includes three months of observations and uses a more detailed prescription for calculating the 95% error circle that also includes systematic effects ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the preliminary coordinates are consistent with the bright source list position , providing an additional confirmation of the lat capability for consistent localization on relatively short timescales .",
    "the lat detected a new transient @xmath0-ray source in the gp with exhibited an outburst on june 11 , 2009 , with a flux ( e@xmath20mev ) of @xmath28photon.s@xmath23@xmath22 ( statistical)@xcite ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] right panel ) .",
    "the flare had the shortest duration and softest spectrum of the unassociated , low latitude transients making it less significant ( @xmath19 ) over foreground and background emission .",
    "it coincided with a lat source detected in 9-months ( aug 2008 - apr 2009 ) of all - sky monitoring data ( j2000.0 : ra@xmath29 , dec = @xmath30 , with a 95% confidence error circle radius @xmath31 ( statistical ) ) .",
    "the new lat detection increased by a factor of @xmath32 with respect to the source flux level detected during the earlier period .",
    "there is no previously reported _",
    "egret _ @xmath0-ray detection at this location .",
    "following each lat transient detection , we triggered target of opportunity _",
    "swift_@xcite observations designed to search for plausible counterparts .",
    "a pair of snapshot ( 4 - 7ks ) exposures were obtained approximately two to three days after the onset of @xmath0-ray activity for the targets , with a third observation obtained 2 weeks ( 3egj0903 - 3531 ) and 1 month later ( j0910 - 5041 ) in order to search for variability on longer timescales .    within the lat r68 of 3egj0903 - 3531 , there are four @xmath33 x - ray sources from the summed xrt exposure ( fig .",

    "additional arguments based on temporal and spectral characteristics are required to support firm associations .",
