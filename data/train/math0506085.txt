    "due to the specialized nature of this paper we assume that the reader is already familiar with the theory of quasigroups and loops . we therefore omit basic definitions and results ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    in a sense , a nonassociative loop is closest to a group when it contains a subgroup of index two .",

    "a groupoid identity is of _ bol - moufang type _ if it has three distinct variables , two of the variables occur once on each side , the third variable occurs twice on each side , and the variables occur in the same order on both sides .",
    "a loop is of _ bol - moufang type _ if it belongs to a variety of loops defined by a single identity of bol - moufang type .",
    "figure [ fg : bm ] shows all varieties of loops of bol - moufang type and all inclusions among them ( cf . @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some varieties of figure [ fg : bm ] can be defined equivalently by other identities of bol - moufang type .",
    "for instance , moufang loops are equivalently defined by the identity @xmath15 .",

    "we therefore first carefully define what we mean by a construction similar to ( see section [ sc : mult ] ) , and then identify situations in which two given constructions are `` the same '' ( see sections [ sc : red ] , [ sc : same ] , [ sc : loops ] ) .",
