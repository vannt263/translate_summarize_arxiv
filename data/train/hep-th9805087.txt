    "despite of the  unphysical \" properties of coupling a negative cosmological constant to general relativity , anti - de sitter space has a number of good properties .",
    "it has been shown to be stable @xcite , and to possess positive energy representations @xcite ( see @xcite for a review of further properties of anti - de sitter space ) . recently",
    ", anti - de sitter space has appeared in a surprising new context .",
    "maldacena @xcite has conjectured that the large @xmath0 limit of certain super conformal theories are equivalent to a string theory on a background containing the direct product of anti - de sitter space ( in five dimensions ) times a compact manifold .",
    "the conjecture raised in @xcite has been interpreted as an anti - de sitter holography in @xcite by noticing that the boundary of anti - de sitter space is conformal minkowski space . in this sense ,",
    "the relation between conformal field theory in four dimensions and type iib string theory on ads@xmath1 is analog to the relation between three dimensional chern - simons theory and 1 + 1 conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "the relationship between 5d anti - de sitter space and conformal field theory is particularly interesting in the context of quantum black holes .",
    "the reason is that , in 2 + 1 dimensions , the ads / cft correspondence has provided interesting proposals to understand the 2 + 1 black hole entropy @xcite .",
    "one may wonder whether there exists black holes analogous to the 2 + 1 black hole in five dimensions .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "it is now known that identifying point in anti - de sitter space , in any number of dimensions , gives rise to black hole structures .",
    "these black holes , often called  topological black holes \" , were first discussed in three dimensions in @xcite , in four dimensions in @xcite , and in higher dimensions in @xcite .",
    "further properties have been studied in @xcite .",
    "a topological black hole can be defined as a spacetime whose local properties are trivial ( constant curvature , for example ) but its causal global structure is that of a black hole .",
    "the higher dimensional ( @xmath2 ) topological black hole has an interesting causal structure displayed by a @xmath3 kruskal ( or penrose - carter ) diagram , as opposed to the usual 2-dimensional picture @xcite .",
    "indeed , the metric in kruskal coordinates has an explicit @xmath4 invariance , as opposed to the schwarzschild black hole having an @xmath5 invariance .",
    "accordingly , the topology of this black hole is @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the compactified coordinate , and @xmath8 denotes @xmath9dimensional conformal minkowski space . just as for ordinary black holes , in the euclidean formalism",
    "the minkowski factor becomes @xmath10 .",
    "this topology has to be compared with @xmath11 arising in usual situations like the @xmath12-dimensional schwarzschild black hole",
    ".    we shall start ( sec .",
    "ii ) by reviewing the main properties of the four dimensional topological black hole . of particular interest is the euclidean black hole obtained by identifications on euclidean anti - de sitter space .",
    "we shall exhibit in section [ euc/4 ] the explicit relation between the euclidean manifold considered in @xcite , as the euclidean sector of the topological black hole .",
    "we then introduce the five dimensional black hole metric ( sec .",
    "iii ) , and study its embedding in a chern - simons theory in sec .",
    "iv . the black hole has a non - trivial topological structure and its associated holonomies are calculated in sec .",
    "v. finally , we shall consider other possible solutions with exotic topologies following from an ansatz suggested by the topological black hole in @xmath12 dimensions .",
    "we shall start by considering the four dimensional case . for a exhaustive analysis and classification of the properties of anti - de sitter space with identifications see @xcite .",
    "here we shall review and further develop the three dimensional causal structure introduced in @xcite and , in particular , the form of the metric in kruskal coordinates .      in four dimensions anti -",
    "de sitter space is defined as the universal covering of the surface @xmath13 this surface has ten killing vectors or isometries and define the anti - de sitter group .",
    "we shall identify points on this space along the boost @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an arbitrary real constant .",
    "the norm of @xmath16 can be positive , negative or zero .",
    "this is the key property leading to black holes @xcite .",
    "identifications along a rotational killing vector produce the conical singularities discussed in @xcite which do not exhibit horizons .    in order to see graphically the role of the identifications , we plot parametrically the surface ( [ ads4 ] ) in terms of the values of @xmath17 .",
    "[ f1 ] -3 cm    first we consider the surface @xmath18 giving rise to the null surface @xmath19 then we consider the surface @xmath20 which is represented by the hyperboloid @xmath21 in fig .",
    "1 , the ` time ' coordinate @xmath22 is drawn along the z - axis . hence , future directed light cones are oriented upwards .",
    "the cone ( [ cone ] ) has two pointwise connected branches , called @xmath23 and @xmath24 , defined by @xmath25 similarly , the hyperboloid ( [ hyper ] ) has two disconnected branches that we have called @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28    the killing vector @xmath16 is spacelike in the region contained in - between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , it is null at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and it is timelike in the causal future of @xmath26 and in the causal past of @xmath27 .",
    "we now identify points along the orbit of @xmath16 .",
    "the 1-dimensional manifold orthogonal to fig . 1 becomes compact and isomorphic to @xmath7 .",
    "the region where @xmath29 becomes chronologically pathological because the identifications produce timelike curves .",
    "it is thus natural to remove it from the physical spacetime .",
    "the hyperboloid is thus a singularity because timelike geodesics end there . in that sense @xmath26 and @xmath30",
    "represent the future and past singularities , respectively .",
    "once the singularities are identified one can now see that the upper cone @xmath23 defined in ( [ cone ] ) represents the future horizon .",
    "indeed , @xmath23 coincides with the boundary of the causal past of lightlike infinity .",
    "in other words , all particles in the causal future of @xmath23 can only hit the singularity .",
    "because infinity is connected in this geometry , as opposed to the usual schwarzschild black hole having two disconnected asymptotic regions , the lower cone does not represent a horizon in the usual sense .",
    "note , however , that the lower cone does contain relevant invariant information .",
    "for example , all particles in the causal past of @xmath24 come from the past singularity .    in summary",
    ", we have seen that by identifying points in anti - de sitter space one can produce a black hole with an unusual topology .",
    "the causal structure is displayed by a three dimensional penrose diagram ( see fig 2 ) , as opposed to the usual two dimensional picture . since , each point in fig .",
    "1 represents a circle , the topology of this black hole is @xmath31 , where we denote by @xmath8 conformal minkowski space in @xmath32 dimensions .",
    "[ f2 ]      so far we have not displayed any metric .",
    "the @xmath31 black hole can be best described in terms of kruskal coordinates .",
    "let us introduce local coordinates on anti - de sitter space ( in the region @xmath33 ) adapted to the killing vector used to make the identifications .",
    "we introduce the @xmath34 dimensionless local coordinates @xmath35 by @xmath36 with @xmath37 before the identifications are made , the coordinate ranges are @xmath38 and @xmath39 with the restriction @xmath40 .",
    "note that the boundary @xmath41 correspond to the hyperbolic  ball \" @xmath42 .",
    "the induced metric has the kruskal form @xmath43 and the killing vector reads @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the quotient space is thus simply obtained by identifying @xmath46 , and the resulting topology clearly is @xmath47 . with the help of ( [ k ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that the kruskal diagram associated to this geometry is the one shown in fig .",
    "1 . thus , the metric ( [ ds / krus ] ) represents the @xmath31 black hole written in kruskal coordinates .",
    "the metric ( [ ds / krus ] ) has some differences with the usual schwarzschild ",
    "kruskal metric that are worth mentioning .",
    "first of all , infinity is connected .",
    "there is only one asymptotic region with the topology of a cylinder @xmath48 and thus , in particular , only one patch of kruskal coordinates is needed to cover the full black hole spacetime .",
    "second , the metric has an explicit @xmath49 symmetry .",
    "the presence of the @xmath50 factor is a consequence of the three dimensional character of the causal structure .",
    "one could project down the penrose diagram ( fig .",
    "2 ) to a flat diagram , as done in @xcite , but this is not natural and makes the causal structure more complicated .",
    "the issue of trapped surfaces in the four dimensional topological black hole was studied in @xcite where it was proved that there exists a non - trivial apparent horizon .",
    "we would like to point out here that if one defines trapped surfaces as suggested by the three dimensional kruskal diagram , then the apparent horizon is not present .",
    "we shall say that a closed spatial surface is trapped if its evolution along any light like curve diminishes its area .",
    "conversely , we say that the surface is not trapped if there exists at least one light like curve along which the surface increases its area . since every point in fig . 1 represents a circle ,",
    "trapped surfaces are circles in this black hole and not spheres or tori .",
    "the existence of trapped surfaces ( as defined above ) in the black hole geometry can be easily checked using the kruskal coordinates . at each point in fig .",
    "1 labeled by coordinates @xmath51 there is a circle of radius @xmath52 , and inside the region @xmath53 of fig . 1 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . from ( [ r - y ] ) we see that a variation in the coordinates @xmath56 produces the following variation in @xmath57 @xmath58 since we move along a light like curve @xmath59 .",
    "it is then easy to see that the product @xmath60 is negative ( just take a basis where @xmath61 ) . thus in the region which is at the causal future of the horizon",
    "( inside @xmath53 ) the circles are trapped .    in the same way",
    ", one can check that the region outside the horizon has non - trapped surfaces , and the region in the causal past of the past horizon is inversely trapped : all surfaces increase their areas .",
    "we have seen that anti - de sitter spacetime leads naturally to the existence of a @xmath31 black hole , and we have found an explicit form for the metric in kruskal form .",
    "a natural question now is whether one can find a global set of coordinates for which the metric takes schwarzschild form .",
    "we shall now prove that locally one can find such coordinates but they do not cover the full manifold , not even the full outer region . indeed , the black hole spacetime is not static .",
    "this has a close analogy with the schwarzschild black hole situation . in that case , the spherically symmetric coordinates cover the outer manifold and the metric looks static there .",
    "the maximal extension covers the full manifold but it is not static . in our case ,",
    "the maximal extension is not static and covers the full manifold ( and only one patch is necessary because infinity is connected ) .",
    "the spherically symmetric coordinates cover only part of the spacetime ( not even the full outer region ) but the metric looks static .",
    "we introduce local  spherical \" coordinates @xmath62 and @xmath57 in the hyperplane @xmath63 : @xmath64 with @xmath65^{1/2}$ ] and the ranges @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the metric ( [ ds / krus ] ) acquires the schwarzschild form @xmath69 with @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the arc length of a hyperbolic 2-sphere . in these coordinates the horizon is located at @xmath72 , the point where @xmath73 vanishes .    in the coordinates @xmath74",
    ", the metric looks static and has a schwarzschild form , however , they do not cover the full outer region .",
    "indeed , the difference @xmath75 is constrained to be positive in the region covered by these coordinates .",
    "this has to be expected , because it has been proved in @xcite that there are no timelike , globally defined , killing vector in this geometry .",
    "note that @xmath76 is a timelike killing vector of ( [ ds / sch ] ) with norm @xmath77 .",
    "it is also clear that one can not find schwarzschild coordinates interpolating the outer and inner regions . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the metric ( [ ds / sch ] ) changes its signature and therefore it does not represent the interior of the black hole . finally note that the metric in the form ( [ ds / sch ] ) has some similarities with the metric used in @xcite in the ads / cft correspondence , @xmath79 the function @xmath80 is multiplying four coordinates rather than a single one , thus the point @xmath81 , called the horizon , has the higher dimensional structure described above . to pass to the region",
    "@xmath82 one would probably need to make an analytic extension ( kruskal extension ) of ( [ u ] ) .",
    "there is another change of coordinates of ( [ ds / krus ] ) , which has the advantage of covering the entire exterior of the minkowskian black hole geometry : @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "as is clear from the discussion above , the metric in this coordinate frame must show a explicit dependence in time .",
    "in fact , @xmath85 with @xmath86 note that for any constant value of @xmath87 , this metric describes a three dimensional black hole @xcite .",
    "we shall now study the metric in the limit @xmath88 .",
    "since in this limit the killing vector is not well defined , one may wonder whether the vacuum state @xmath89 corresponds to anti - de sitter space , or anti - de sitter space with identified points . in 2 + 1",
    "dimensions the vacuum has identified points and the corresponding killing vector belongs to a different class in the classification of all possible isometries @xcite .",
    "the metric ( [ ds / sch ] ) does not have a smooth limit for @xmath88 . in order to take the limit we need to redefine the coordinate @xmath87 , @xmath90",
    "now we can take the limit @xmath88 in ( [ ds / sch ] ) and , after defining @xmath91 , the metric takes the final form @xmath92 where , in the limit @xmath89 , the range of @xmath93 becomes @xmath94 .    in this form",
    "it is clear that this space represents anti - de sitter with identified points .",
    "locally , ( [ v ] ) is isomorphic the upper - half poincar plane and therefore it does have constant curvature .",
    "however , the rank of @xmath95 is @xmath96 which means that there are identified points .",
    "note that the same conclusions can be obtained if one starts with the kruskal metric ( [ ds / krus ] ) , absorbing @xmath15 in the coordinates @xmath97 , and then letting @xmath88 .",
    "the black hole constructed above has an euclidean sector which can be obtained from euclidean anti - de sitter space with identified points . indeed , consider the surface @xmath98 where we identify points along the boost in the plane @xmath99 .",
    "following the same steps as before one obtains the euclidean kruskal metric , @xmath100 with @xmath101 the ranges are @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "after the identifications are done , the coordinate @xmath95 has the range @xmath104 . the full euclidean manifold is thus mapped into a three dimensional solid ball @xmath105 times @xmath7 .",
    "the boundary is then the 2-sphere @xmath42 times @xmath7 .",
    "the metric ( [ ds / kruse ] ) can be put in a more familiar form by making the change of coordinates @xmath106 : @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "one obtains @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "this metric clearly represents euclidean anti - de sitter space with a  time \" coordinate @xmath111 . actually , since @xmath95 is compact , @xmath112 , ( [ u ] ) should be called thermal anti - de sitter space .",
    "the metric ( [ u ] ) is the four dimensional version of the manifold considered in @xcite .",
    "the fact that we have end up with identified ads is not surprising since this was our starting point .",
    "the metric ( [ u ] ) represents the euclidean sector of our @xmath31 black hole .",
    "we can now look at the black hole from a different point of view .",
    "suppose we start with euclidean anti - de sitter space with metric ( [ u ] ) .",
    "now we ask what is the hyperbolic , or minkowskian sector , associated to this line element . the most natural continuation to minkowski space",
    "is obtained by setting @xmath113 and yields minkowskian anti - de sitter space to imaginary values one is forced to unwrap it in order to eliminate the closed timelike curves . ] .",
    "however , our previous discussion shows that one could keep @xmath95 real and instead make the transformation @xmath114 .",
    "this leads to an incomplete spacetime whose maximal extension give rise to the three dimensional kruskal diagram shown before .",
    "the idea of using the azimuthal coordinate as time was first discussed in @xcite .",
    "the relation between thermal anti - de sitter and the black hole is already present in the three dimensional situation .",
    "indeed , consider the spinless three dimensional black hole @xmath115 with @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the period of @xmath119 is fixed by demanding the absence of conical singularities in the @xmath120 plane and gives @xmath121 .",
    "we shall now prove that there exists a global change of coordinates that maps ( [ btz ] ) into the three dimensional thermal ads space .",
    "first define @xmath122 .",
    "this maps ( [ btz ] ) into @xmath123 since @xmath124 , we can define @xmath125 which has period @xmath126 .",
    "we also define @xmath127 which has the period @xmath128 .",
    "finally we define @xmath129 obtaining @xmath130 with @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the key element in this transformation is the permutation between the angular and time coordinates .",
    "it should be evident that for the minkowskian black hole this transformation is not possible .",
    "the permutation between @xmath119 and @xmath95 can be interpreted as a modular transformation that maps the boundary condition @xmath134 into @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "it is then not a surprise that the black hole had a temperature @xmath136 , while ( [ tads ] ) has a temperature @xmath137 .",
    "indeed , the corresponding modular parameters are related by a modular transformation @xcite . the line elements ( [ btz ] ) and",
    "( [ tads ] ) have recently been investigated in the context of string theory in @xcite .",
    "we have seen in the last section that by identifying points in anti - de sitter space one can produce a black hole with many of the properties of the 2 + 1 black hole .",
    "the topology of the causal structure is however different . in this section",
    "we shall describe how this procedure can be repeated in five dimensions .",
    "actually , the black hole exists for any dimension @xcite but the five dimensional case has some peculiarities that makes it worth of a separate study , specially in the euclidean sector .",
    "we shall not repeat here the geometrical construction of the 5d black hole ( it can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we only quote here the form of the kruskal metric which is a natural generalization of ( [ ds / krus ] ) , @xmath138 where @xmath139 , @xmath140 with @xmath40 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath57 depends on @xmath143 and it is given by @xmath144 this metric represents the non - rotating black hole in kruskal coordinates .",
    "it is clear that the causal structure associated to this black hole is four dimensional .",

    "we shall indeed use this interpretation in the next section to define global charges .    just as in the four dimensional case",

    "note that we can always eliminate the factor @xmath472 in @xmath473 ( but not the sign of @xmath437 ) , redefining the time coordinate .",
    "moreover , we can redefine @xmath57 and eliminate @xmath474 from @xmath475 ( the price we pay here is the redefinition of @xmath415 ) .    for positive mass and negative cosmological constant we have two possibilities depending on the sign of @xmath437 .",
    "when @xmath476 we obtain the generalization of the black hole solutions found in @xcite for any dimension .",
    "again , when @xmath477 , the metric @xmath415 can represent any surface with @xmath478 , which has more solutions than a surface of genus @xmath210 . in @xmath461 , for example this could have the topology @xmath479 .",
    "for positive cosmological constant and @xmath480 we have the generalization of the schwarzschild  de sitter solutions , which have an event horizon and a cosmological horizon . when @xmath481 we have again the same kind of solution , but with surfaces of constant radius of hyperbolic geometry .    during this work",
    "we have benefited from many discussions and useful comments raised by marc henneaux , miguel ortiz , peter peldn , claudio teitelboim and jorge zanelli .",
