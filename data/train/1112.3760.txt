    "marine ecosystems of the eastern boundary upwelling zones are well known for their major contribution to the world ocean productivity .",
    "they are characterized by wind - driven upwelling of cold nutrient - rich waters along the coast that supports elevated plankton and pelagic fish production @xcite .",
    "variability is introduced by strong advection along the shore , physical forcings by local and large scales winds , and high submeso- and meso - scale activities over the continental shelf and beyond , linking the coastal domain with the open ocean .",
    "the benguela upwelling system ( bus ) is one of the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems ( ebus ) of the world .",
    "the coastal area of the benguela ecosystem extends from southern angola ( around 17@xmath0s ) along the west coast of namibia and south africa ( 36@xmath0s ) .",
    "it is surrounded by two boundary currents , the warm angola current in the north , and the temperate agulhas current in the south .",
    "the bus can itself be subdivided into two subdomains by the powerful luderitz upwelling cell @xcite .",
    "most of the biogeochemical activity occurs within the upwelling front and the coast , although it can be extended further offshore toward the open ocean by the numerous filamental structures developing offshore @xcite . in the bus , as in the other major upwelling areas , high mesoscale activity due to eddies and filaments impacts strongly marine planktonic ecosystem over the continental shelf and beyond @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of horizontal stirring on phytoplankton dynamics in the bus within an idealized two dimensional modelling framework .",
    "based on satellite data of the ocean surface , @xcite recently suggested that mesoscale activity has a negative effect on chlorophyll standing stocks in the four ebus .",
    "this was obtained by correlating remote sensed chlorophyll data with a lagrangian measurement of lateral stirring in the surface ocean ( see methods section ) .",
    "this result was unexpected since mesoscale physical structures , particularly mesoscale eddies , have been related to higher planktonic production and stocks in the open ocean @xcite as well as off a major ebus @xcite . a more recent and thorough study performed by @xcite in the california and the canary current systems extended the initial results from @xcite . based on satellite derived estimates of net primary production , of upwelling strength and of eddy kinetic energy ( eke ) as a measure the intensity of mesoscale activity ,",
    "they confirmed the suppressive effect of mesoscale structures on biological production in upwelling areas .",
    "investigating the mechanism behind this observation by means of on 3d eddy - resolving coupled models , @xcite showed that mesoscale eddies tend to export offshore and downward a certain pool of nutrients not being effectively used by the biology in the coastal areas .",
    "this process they called `` nutrients leakage '' is also having a negative feedback by diminishing the pool of deep nutrients available in the surface waters being re - upwelled continuously .",
    "in our work , we focused on the benguela area , being the most contrasting area of all ebus in terms of stirring intensity @xcite .",
    "although the mechanisms studied by @xcite seem to involve 3d dynamics , the initial observation of this suppressive effect was essentially based on two - dimensional ( 2d ) datasets @xcite . in this work",
    "we use 2d numerical analysis in a semi - realistic framework to better understand the effects of a 2d turbulent flow on biological dynamics , apart from the complex 3d bio - physical processes .",
    "the choice of this simple horizontal numerical approach is indeed supported by other theoretical 2d studies that also displayed a negative correlation between stirring and biomass @xcite . meanwhile , since biological productivity in upwelling areas rely on the ( wind - driven ) vertical uplift of nutrients , we introduced in our model a nutrient source term with an intensity and spatial distribution corresponding to the upwelling characteristics . instead of the commonly used eke , which is an eulerian diagnostic tool , we used here a lagrangian measurement of mesoscale stirring that has been demonstrated as a powerful tool to study patchy chlorophyll distributions influenced by dynamical structures at mesoscale , such as upwelling filaments @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian perspective provides a complementary insight to transport phenomena in the ocean with respect to the eulerian one .",
    "in particular , the concept of lagrangian coherent structure may give a global idea of transport in a given area , separating regions with different dynamical behavior , and signaling avenues and barriers to transport , which are of great relevance for the marine biological dynamics .",
    "while the eulerian approach describes the characteristics of the velocity field , the lagrangian one addresses the effects of this field on transported substances , which is clearly more directly related to the biological dynamics .",
    "for example the work by @xcite describes currents in the world ocean having the same level of eddy kinetic energy but having two different stirring characteristics , as quantified by lagrangian tools .",
    "further discussions comparing lagrangian and eulerian diagnostics can be found , for example , in @xcite and the above cited @xcite . to consider velocity fields with different characteristics and to test the effect of the spatial resolution ,",
    "different flow fields are used , one derived from satellite and two produced by numerical simulations at two different spatial resolutions .",

    "[ sec : summary ] , we summed - up our main findings .",
    "we used three different 2d surface velocity fields of the benguela area .",
    "two are obtained from the numerical model regional ocean model system ( roms ) , and the other one from a combined satellite product .",
    "roms is a free surface , hydrostatic , primitive equation model , and we used here an eddy - resolving climatologically forced run provided by @xcite . at each grid point , linear horizontal resolution is the same in both the longitudinal , @xmath1 , and latitudinal , @xmath2 , directions , which leads to angular resolutions @xmath3 and @xmath4 . the numerical model was run onto 2 different grids : a coarse one at spatial resolution of @xmath5 , and a finer one at @xmath6 of spatial resolution . in the following we label the dataset from the coarser resolution run as _",
    "roms1/4 _ , and the finer one as _",
    "roms1/12_. for both runs , vertical resolution is variable with @xmath7 layers in total , while only data from the surface upper layer are used in the following .",
    "since the flows are obtained from climatological forcings , they would represent a mean annual cycle of the typical surface currents of the benguela region .      a velocity field derived from satellite observations",
    "is compared to the simulated fields described previously .",
    "it consists of surface currents computed from a combination of wind - driven ekman currents , at 15 m depth , derived from quickscat wind estimates , and geostrophic currents calculated using time - variable sea surface heights ( ssh ) obtained from satellite @xcite .",
    "these ssh were calculated from mapped altimetric sea level anomalies combined with a mean dynamic topography .",
    "this velocity field , labeled as _",
    "satellite1/4 _ , covers a period from june 2002 to june 2005 with a spatial resolution of @xmath8 in both longitudinal and latitudinal directions .      to validate simulated plankton concentrations",
    ", we use a three - year - long time series , from january 2002 to january 2005 , of ocean color data . phytoplankton pigment concentration ( chlorophyll - a ) is obtained from monthly sea viewing wide field - of - view sensor ( seawifs ) products , generated by the nasa goddard earth science ( ges)/distributed active archive center ( daac ) .",
    "gridded global data were used with a resolution of approximately 9 by 9 km .",
    "fsles @xcite provides a measure of dispersion , and thus of stirring and mixing , as a function of the spatial resolution .",
    "this lagrangian tool allows isolating the different regimes corresponding to different length scales of the oceanic flows , as well as identifying lagrangian coherent structures ( lcss ) present in the data @xcite .",
    "fsle are computed from @xmath9 , the time required for two particles of fluid ( one of them placed at @xmath10 ) to separate from an initial distance of @xmath11 ( at time @xmath12 ) to a final distance of @xmath13 , as @xmath14 it is natural to choose the initial points @xmath10 on the nodes of a grid with lattice spacing coinciding with the initial separation of fluid particles @xmath11 .",
    "then , values of @xmath15 are obtained in a grid with lattice separation @xmath11 . in most of this",
    "work the resolution of the fsle field , @xmath11 , is chosen equal to the resolution of the velocity field , @xmath16 .",
    "other choices of parameter are possible and @xmath11 can take any value , even much smaller than the resolution of the velocity field @xcite .",
    "this opens many possibilities that will not be fully explored in this work ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : lat_mixing ] and [ ape : smooth ] ) . using similar parameters for the fsles computation",
    ", we also investigate the response of the coupled biophysical system to variable resolution of the velocity field , ( see @xcite for further details about the sensitivity and robustness of the fsles ) .",
    "the field of fsles thus depends on the choice of two length scales : the initial , @xmath11 and the final @xmath13 separations . as in previous works",
    "@xcite we focus on transport processes at mesoscale , so that @xmath13 is taken as about 110 @xmath17 , or 1@xmath0 , which is the order of the size of mesoscale eddies at mid latitudes . to compute @xmath15 we need to know the trajectories of the particles , which gives the lagrangian character to this quantity .",
    "the equations of motion that describe the horizontal evolution of particle trajectories in longitudinal and latitudinal spherical coordinates , @xmath18 , are : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the eastwards and northwards components of the surface velocity field , and @xmath22 is the radius of the earth ( 6371 km ) .",
    "the ridges of the fsle field can be used to define the lagrangian coherent structures ( lcss ) @xcite , which are useful to characterize the flow from the lagrangian point of view @xcite .",
    "since we are only interested in the ridges of large fsle values , the ones which significantly affect stirring , lcss can be computed by the high values of fsle which have a line - like shape .",
    "we compute fsles by integrating backwards - in - time the particle trajectories since attracting lcss ( and its associated unstable manifolds ) have a direct physical interpretation @xcite .",
    "tracers , such as temperature and chlorophyll - a , spread along the attracting lcss , thus creating their typical filamental structure @xcite .",
    "the plankton model is similar to the one used in previous studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it describes the interaction of a three - level trophic chain in the mixed layer of the ocean , including phytoplankton @xmath23 , zoo - plankton @xmath24 and dissolved inorganic nutrient @xmath25 , whose concentrations evolve in time according to the following equations :    @xmath26    where the dynamics of the nutrients , eq .",
    "( [ eq.biolo1 ] ) , is determined by nutrient supply due to the vertical transport @xmath27 , its uptake by phytoplankton ( 2@xmath28 term ) and its recycling by bacteria from sinking particles ( remineralization ) ( 3@xmath29 term ) .",
    "vertical mixing which brings subsurface nutrients into the mixed surface layer of the ocean is parameterized in our coupled model ( see below ) , since the hydrodynamical part considers only horizontal 2d transport .",
    "the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq.biolo2 ] ) represent the phytoplankton growth by consumption of @xmath25 ( i.e. primary production @xmath30 ) , the grazing by zooplankton ( @xmath31 ) , and natural mortality of phytoplankton . the last equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq.biolo3 ] ) , represents zooplankton growth by consuming phytoplankton minus zooplankton quadratic mortality .",
    "an important term of our model is the parameterization of the vertical transport of nutrients by coastal upwelling .",
    "assuming constant nutrient concentration @xmath32 below the mixed layer , this term can be expressed as : @xmath33 where the function @xmath34 , which depends on time and space ( on the two dimensional location @xmath10 ) , determines the amplitude and the spatial distribution of vertical mixing in the model , thus specifying the strength of the coastal upwelling .",

    "the areas of more intense horizontal stirring due to mesoscale activity can be identified by large values of temporal averages of backward fsles ( see figure [ fig : mixing ] ) . while there are visible differences between the results from the different velocity fields , especially in the small - scale patterns , the spatial pattern are quantitatively well reproduced .",
