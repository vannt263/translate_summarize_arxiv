    "since their introduction in @xcite _ amplify - and - forward ( af ) _ relay schemes have been studied in the context of _ cooperative communication _ @xcite , estimating the capacity of relay networks @xcite , and _ analog network coding _",
    "for cooperative communication , af schemes provide spatial diversity to fight against fading ; for capacity estimation of relay networks , such schemes provide achievable lower bounds that are known to be optimal in some communication scenarios ; and for analog network coding , given the broadcast nature of the wireless medium that allows the _ mixing _ of the signals in the air , these schemes provide a communication strategy that achieves high throughput with low computational complexity at internal nodes . in this paper , we concern ourselves mostly with the capacity analysis of a general class of gaussian af relay networks . extensions of our method and results to cooperative communication and analog network coding scenarios is part of our future work .    in previous work , while analyzing the performance of af schemes in relay networks one or more of the following assumptions have been made : networks with a small number of nodes @xcite ; networks with simple topologies @xcite ; or relay operation in the high - snr regime , @xcite .",
    "however , for two reasons , we believe that it is important to characterize the performance of the af schemes without such assumptions .",
    "first , we feel that for a scheme such as amplify - and - forward that allows one to exploit the broadcast nature of the wireless medium such assumptions on the size and topology may result in lower achievable performance than otherwise .",
    "second , even in the low - snr regimes amplify - and - forward can be capacity - achieving relay strategy in some scenarios , @xcite .",
    "therefore , a framework to address the performance of af schemes in general wireless relay networks is desired .    however , one major issue with constructing such a framework is the following . in general wireless relay networks with af relaying ,",
    "the resulting input - output channel between the source and the destination is an intersymbol interference ( isi ) channel ( @xmath0@xcite ) with colored noise .",
    "this is because both the source signal and the noise introduced at the relay nodes may reach the destination via multiple paths with differing delays . without the assumptions above , this results in a formidable problem to analyze with the existing methods @xcite .",
    "our main contribution is that we provide a framework to compute the maximum achievable rate with af schemes for a class of general wireless relay networks , namely _",
    "gaussian relay networks_. this framework casts the problem of computing the maximum rate achievable with af relay networks as an optimization problem .",
    "our work shows that amplifying the received signal to the maximum possible value at intermediate nodes might result in sub - optimal end - to - end throughput .",
    "also , we establish the generality of the proposed formulation by showing that it allows us to derive in a unified and simple manner not only the various existing results on the performance of simple af relay networks but also new results for more complex networks that can not be addressed in a straightforward manner with existing methods .",
    "we show through various examples that for a large class of relay networks the af schemes can achieve rates within a constant factor of the cut - set upper - bounds on the capacity of general wireless relay networks .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sysmodel ] we introduce the general class of gaussian af relay networks addressed in this paper . in section  [ sec : achievablerate ] we formulate the problem of maximum rate achievable via af schemes in these networks . in section  [ sec : computinginforate ] we compute the rates achievable via af schemes for two instances of such relay networks under various communication scenarios , and then in section  [ sec : capacity ] we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the gap between these rates and the corresponding upper bounds on the capacity of general wireless relay networks computed there .",

    "if a relay merely amplifies and forwards its received signal in such scenarios then it may be use a significant fraction of its power budget on forwarding the previously forwarded information .",
    "therefore , motivated by some work on analog network coding , such as @xcite , we propose the following relay operation to allow the relays to expend their transmit power in forwarding only the `` new '' information .    * _ relay operation : _ * we assume that each relay node maintains a buffer of signals it forwarded previously .",
