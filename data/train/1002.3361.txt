    "new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) should either be kinematically inaccessible or couple very weakly to the sm in order to have evaded experimental efforts to date .",
    "the first possibility , of heavy new physics , has received the most attention and has pushed us to build ever larger colliders in an attempt to directly probe new energy frontiers  @xcite .",
    "it has also motivated the construction of precise lower - energy probes that search for the indirect effects of heavy new physics  @xcite .",
    "the second possibility , of relatively light new physics which couples very weakly to the sm , has not been explored to the same extent .",
    "such new physics can also be sought in high - energy particle colliders , but in many cases a more promising route is to use lower - energy colliders with an enormous luminosity .",
    "hidden sectors containing new particles coupled very weakly to the sm comprise an interesting class of new physics scenarios that emerge naturally in a number of extensions of the sm .",
    "for example , theories of supersymmetry breaking typically contain a hidden sector where the breaking actually occurs .",
    "this hidden sector only couples to the sm via a set of heavy mediator particles  @xcite and in some cases can give rise to very light states  @xcite .",
    "several recently proposed theories of dark matter , motivated by astrophysical measurements such as pamela  @xcite and fermi  @xcite , also contain light hidden sectors  @xcite .",
    "new gauge groups under which the sm fields are singlets also arise frequently in string - theoretic constructions  @xcite .",
    "if the characteristic mass scale of a hidden sector is at or below a few gev , it can potentially be discovered in current and upcoming fixed - target  @xcite and @xmath1 colliders  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore timely and interesting to study hidden sector models where the gev scale emerges in a ( technically ) natural way .",
    "previous works have shown that the gev scale can arise naturally in supersymmetric models provided supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector is suppressed relative to the sm  @xcite .",
    "similarly , models with composite hidden states can naturally realize a light hidden sector via dimensional transmutation  @xcite , and have been studied in the context of hidden valleys  @xcite and unparticles  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we realize a light abelian hidden sector in an extended randall - sundrum  ( rs ) model  @xcite .",
    "rs models provide a geometric means by which to naturally generate mass hierarchies and can readily realize sub - planckian scales as simple redshifted incarnates of planck scale input parameters .",
    "the specific model we consider consists of the standard bulk rs scenario together with a second hidden bulk space .",
    "the sm propagates exclusively in one of the bulks with the higgs localized on the ir brane to realize the weak / planck hierarchy .",
    "the second hidden bulk shares the same uv brane but has an independent ir scale .",
    "we take the hidden ir scale to be near a gev and , as a minimal scenario , consider a @xmath0 gauge theory propagating in the hidden bulk .",
    "an illustration of the setup appears in figure  [ rshidpic ] .    at energies near a gev",
    "the minimal spectrum consists of the sm along with towers of hidden gev - spaced gauge and gravity kk modes .",
    "the sm couples to the hidden kk vectors primarily via a localized kinetic mixing operator connecting @xmath0 and @xmath2 on the shared uv brane .",
    "this kinetic mixing induces a suppressed coupling between the hidden vectors and sm matter which , for the lightest hidden kk modes , is proportional to sm electric charge  @xcite .",
    "relative to the lightest @xmath0 mode , the higher modes have a coupling that is suppressed , but only by a moderate logarithmic factor .",
    "this can potentially allow the creation of several hidden gauge kk modes at high luminosity low - energy particle colliders .",
    "kinetic mixing also allows these modes to decay back to the sm and we show that such channels can dominate , at least for the first few kk states .",
    "fixed - target experiments and meson factories therefore have the potential to explore the geometry of a warped extra dimension beyond what might be possible at the lhc .    although there is nothing fundamental about our choice of a gev for the hidden ir scale , we feel there is a strong phenomenological motivation to study models of this type .",
    "rs models can be thought of as effective theory frameworks that capture some of the gross features of the warped throats found in string theory .",
    "the simplifications of the rs model include neglecting transverse throat structure and shrinking the rest of the compactification manifold to a single point ( represented by the uv brane ) .",
    "string compactifications can also contain multiple warped throats with distinct characteristic ir scales  @xcite .",
    "this situation can be modeled with multiple rs bulks sharing a common uv brane  @xcite .",
    "the essential point is that if the sm is localized in one throat and has similar couplings to other throats , the throats with the lowest ir scales are typically the easiest to detect .",
    "rs models are also thought to be dual to certain classes of 4d conformal field theories  ( cfts ) with conformal symmetry breaking at energies corresponding to the uv and ir scales  @xcite . in the multi - throat picture",
    "the hidden throats are dual to additional hidden 4d cfts that share a common uv breaking of conformal invariance .",
    "these conformal breaking interactions can induce couplings between the different cfts which are modeled by uv localized operators in the 5d picture .",
    "each of the hidden cfts has an , in principle , independent ir scale at which the conformality of the given cft is broken .",
    "these ir scales set the characteristic scale for low - energy composites of the cfts .",
    "we shall use the language of the 5d multi - throat picture in the present work but one should keep in mind that our investigations also encompass potentially observable effects from a broad class of hidden cfts that couple to the sm . as with multiple warped throats , in a theory with multiple hidden cfts",
    "we typically expect those with light characteristic mass scales to be the most amenable to discovery .",
    "multiple warped bulk spaces have been considered previously in a number of works .",
    "our effective theory description follows that of refs .  @xcite .",
    "various aspects of multi - throat physics from a string - motivated perspective appear in refs .",
    "@xcite , and phenomenological applications can be found in refs .",
    "kinetic mixing in warped spaces was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as in certain string compactifications in refs .",
    "our work also has overlap with several studies of hidden valleys  @xcite , composite dark sectors  @xcite , and unparticles  @xcite .",
    "however , relative to these earlier studies , our specific construction and the application to low - energy probes is new to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we describe the gravitational background of our model .",
    "next , we derive the spectrum of physical vectors and their couplings to sm matter in section  [ sec : gauge ] . in section",
    "[ signals ] we consider the constraints on this scenario and discuss the prospects for new signals in upcoming fixed - target and meson factory experiments .",
    "finally , section  [ conc ] is reserved for our conclusions .",
    "some technical details including the kk graviton spectrum and details of the gauge boson mass diagonalization and couplings appear in the appendix .",
    "the extended rs model that we consider consists of two independent warped bulk spaces , or _",
    "throats _ , sharing a common uv brane .",
    "we use the coordinates @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 , for the extra dimension of the @xmath5-th throat and take the metric in the @xmath5-th throat to be ds^2_i = ( _ dx^dx^ - dz_i^2)= g_mn^i dx^mdx^n , [ bulkmetric ] where @xmath6 is a throat - independent curvature .",
    "the common uv brane , with characteristic mass scale @xmath7 , is located at @xmath8 and ir branes with characteristic scales @xmath9 reside at @xmath10 .",

    "is a solution to the 5d einstein equations  @xcite .",
    "the sm ( hidden sector ) resides in the throat @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) which we refer to as the visible ( hidden ) throat .",
    "the standard bulk rs picture is employed in the visible throat with sm gauge and matter fields propagating in the bulk and the sm higgs localized at @xmath16 .",
    "consistency with precision electroweak bounds requires @xmath17 as per usual in rs models  @xcite . in principle the hidden throat",
    "could have a complicated gauge structure and could contain matter charged under the hidden gauge symmetries .",
    "however , in order to determine the likely low - energy probes of a light hidden sector it suffices to consider a minimal gauge sector .",
    "we therefore assume that the hidden throat contains an abelian @xmath0 gauge group that is broken , either spontaneously by an explicit higgs at @xmath18 or through higgsless ir boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the mass scale on the hidden ir brane is taken to be @xmath19 and the setup is illustrated in figure  [ rshidpic ] .",
    "interactions between the sm and the hidden sector will be mediated by gravity and by local operators on the uv brane . among the set of local operators , we focus primarily on a uv - localized gauge kinetic mixing interaction s_uv - _ uv d^4xg^g^b_x _ , where @xmath20 is the 5d hypercharge gauge field strength",
    ", @xmath21 is the 5d @xmath0 field strength and @xmath22 is the the bulk gravity scale .",
    "this interaction produces the only significant renormalizable coupling between the sm and hidden sector fields in the effective 4d theory and is responsible for the low - energy effects of interest in this work .",
    "the graviton kk spectrum contains a zero mode that extends into both throats and reproduces newtonian gravity in the effective 4d theory .",
    "its coupling is universal and dictated by the effective 4d planck mass , @xmath23 \\simeq \\frac{m_*^3}{k}. \\label{4d_planck}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath24 one has @xmath25 and we also take @xmath26 to ensure the gravitational description can be trusted .",
    "in addition to the zero mode there are massive kk gravitons which split up naturally into a pair of kk towers ; see appendix  [ app : kk_gravity ] for details .",
    "the first ( second ) tower has spacings on the order of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and is strongly localized towards the ir of the hidden ( visible ) throat .",
    "one can show that the gev - spaced kk modes couple extremely weakly to matter on the uv brane and to the sm in the visible throat .",
    "these light kk modes are therefore experimentally viable , which should come as no surprise to those familiar with the viability of gravity in rs2  @xcite ; the kk graviton spectrum here is essentially the rs2 spectrum with the sub - tev modes removed on one side and the sub - gev modes removed on the other .",
    "the gev - scale gravitons do however couple significantly to fields in the hidden bulk with important effects on the phenomenology of the hidden vectors .",
    "metric fluctuations in the throats also give rise to a pair of physical scalar modes ( radions ) , that only acquire mass once a stabilization mechanism is specified .",
    "we will not discuss radius stabilization in this work , but expect that it is straightforward to extend the goldberger - wise mechanism  @xcite to stabilize both throats .",
    "the ratio @xmath29 translates into the rather mild hierarchy of @xmath30 in the non - conformal coordinates , which is easily achieved with small differences in the input parameters . beyond the tuning",
    "required to fix the 4d cosmological constant , the setup is therefore devoid of fine tunings .",
    "in the setup described above the sm is sequestered from the hidden sector , up to gravity and local operators on the common uv brane . for the most part ,",
    "the detailed bulk realization of the sm is not important for the low - energy effects we are interested in .",
    "it will likely require a custodially - extended electroweak gauge sector  @xcite and may include additional flavor symmetries  @xcite .",
    "the one assumption we make is that the hypercharge gauge factor extends to the uv brane , and that it is the only abelian factor to do so .",
    "custodially - extended rs models typically invoke dirichlet boundary conditions on the uv brane , leaving @xmath2 as the only abelian factor to extend to the uv  @xcite .",
    "our assumption is therefore consistent with standard bulk rs constructs .    in what follows",
    "we derive the spectrum of hidden kk vectors and determine their couplings to the sm . as we consider the low - energy physics our results would be qualitatively the same if the sm was simply placed on the uv brane with an alternative mechanism like supersymmetry stabilizing the weak / planck hierarchy  @xcite .      on the hidden side we consider two cases , differentiated by the breaking of the @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "in the first case @xmath0 is broken by the vacuum expectation value  ( vev ) of a hidden higgs @xmath31 confined to the hidden ir brane with @xmath32 .",
    "the second case employs higgsless breaking of @xmath0 via a dirichlet boundary condition on the hidden ir brane  @xcite . increasing @xmath33 towards and above @xmath34 smoothly interpolates between these two cases  @xcite .",
    "neumann boundary conditions are employed for both the sm and the hidden gauge fields on the uv brane , and we treat the kinetic mixing operator as a small perturbation .",
    "the full bulk action for the abelian gauge factors in unitary gauge with @xmath35 is s & & -d^4xdz_1g_1^mag_1^nbb_mnb_ab + & & - d^4xdz_2g_2^mag_2^nbx_mnx_ab + & & - _",

    "these operations induce couplings between sm matter and the hidden vectors and also modify the couplings of the sm @xmath48 boson , thereby providing experimental means by which to explore the present scenario .",
    "we note that despite having motivated the tower of spin - one modes via a warped extra dimension , the methodology we develop in this section is more general and can be employed in any scenario containing a tower of vectors that kinetically mix with sm hypercharge .",

    "we therefore truncate the hidden kk tower at the usual rs kk scale , @xmath57  few tev . for convenience",
    "we define the integer @xmath58 such that @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the sm value of the @xmath48 mass .",

    "consequently the mass mixing angle is suppressed relative to the kinetic mixing parameter , @xmath71 , and in this basis mass mixing effects are subdominant .    with this in mind",
    "the strategy for decoupling the kinetic mixing in eq .   is to always shift the lightest fields and thereby minimize the effects of mass mixing .",

    "a similar discussion follows for the couplings of the kk modes @xmath85 to sm matter , which are given in appendix  [ cov_der_app ] . for modes with @xmath88",
    "the mass suppression of @xmath89 ensures that the dominant coupling of @xmath85 to the sm is via the electromagnetic current @xmath96 .",

    "a warped hidden sector mixing kinetically with the sm can give rise to new signals at the luminosity frontier achieved by fixed - target experiments and meson factories .",
    "since the couplings of hidden kk vectors to the sm are similar , it may be possible to produce multiple kk resonances in relatively low - energy collisions .",

    "the constraints and signals of a warped @xmath0 gauge sector depend sensitively on how the gauge kk modes decay .",

    "however the leading operator of this type has the form @xmath118 and is typically less important than decay channels involving gravitons .",
    "putting these pieces together we see that the lightest gauge kk modes @xmath108 and @xmath119 may potentially decay primarily to pairs of sm fermions . for @xmath112",

    "a hidden higgs may also decay to the sm through gauge kk modes .",
    "the dominance of decays to lower kk modes rather than to the sm coincides with the discussion of unparticles and hidden valleys in refs .",

    "] these higher modes will cascade down to the the lightest hidden kk modes , which will then decay back to the sm producing a high multiplicity of soft final states  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is simply that of the hidden valley paradigm  @xcite .",
    "our scenario extends the vector spectrum of abelian hidden sector models considered previously with an entire kk tower of new kinetically - mixed states .",
    "we present here a preliminary estimate of the current experimental bounds on such a tower , deferring a detailed analysis to a future work  @xcite . for the time being",
    "we assume there is no explicit higgs - like state with mass below the lightest gauge mode for which the bounds can be even stronger  @xcite .",
    "we find that the lightest gauge modes are constrained primarily by low - energy probes .",
    "bounds on heavier kk modes are less strict except for those with masses near the @xmath48 , which as discussed above can have a resonant enhancement in their mixing .",
    "we find that low - energy probes provide the strongest constraints , and the allowed parameter space in minimal models is very similar to that of a single abelian hidden vector .",
    "low - energy probes are typically the most sensitive to the lightest gauge mode for two reasons .",
    "first , eq .",
    "shows that the relative coupling of the higher modes to the sm is somewhat smaller , @xmath128 .",

    "for example , the constraint from the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath129 scales as @xmath130  @xcite , and similarly for bounds from atomic parity violation  @xcite .",
    "bounds from rare meson decays are also weakened by a reduction in the final state phase space  @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , the parameter space in the @xmath131 plane for the full kk tower that is consistent with low - energy tests is nearly identical to that of a single hidden abelian gauge boson with @xmath132 and @xmath133  @xcite . with @xmath134 ,",

    "this is reminiscent of an oblique correction , but we will see that it depends in an essential way on the finite widths of the kk resonances . ignoring initial- and final - state fermion masses , the @xmath48 propagator in the scattering amplitude is modified to , [ zprop ] where @xmath140 is the decay width of @xmath85 .",
    "this correction is enhanced relative to @xmath92 for modes with @xmath137 when @xmath141 , coinciding with the resonant enhancement of the mixing angle found when diagonalizing the full gauge boson mass matrix .",

    "given the precision of the combined electroweak measurements , this is safely small  @xcite .",
    "resonantly enhanced kinetic mixing can also induce non - standard @xmath48 decays .",
    "more precisely , the relevant process is @xmath144 , with the hidden sector states decaying in a cascade down to the lightest hidden kk modes , which subsequently decay to the sm .",
    "this produces a spherical distribution of multiple soft sm final states  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this picture is precisely that of a hidden valley discussed in refs .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from an @xmath145-channel @xmath48 mixing kinetically into an @xmath85 state with @xmath93 , which then decays to lighter graviton and gauge kk modes .",
    "the corresponding `` branching fraction '' , defined as a ratio of rates on the @xmath48-pole , is estimated to go like br(z ) ~ _ n ( ) .",
    "for @xmath143 we find that this fraction is always less than about @xmath146 .",
    "this is at the edge of sensitivity of the lep experiments to exotic @xmath48 decays , and the typical final state consisting of a high multiplicity of soft leptons and pions was not searched for directly  @xcite .",
    "we have argued that a closely - spaced tower of hidden kk modes can be consistent with current bounds for @xmath147 and a mode spacing on the order of or below a gev . for couplings not too much smaller than this ,",

    "the lowest hidden gauge mode will typically be the easiest to find in a fixed - target experiment .",
    "production of this and higher modes will proceed as discussed in refs .",

    "note that it will be possible to reconstruct both resonances provided their mass spacing is not too small .",
    "higher resonances that decay primarily to lighter hidden states will be more challenging to identify in fixed - target experiments . on top of a reduced production rate , the methods proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite rely on using specific geometries tailored to the distribution of signal events to reduce backgrounds .",
    "in a multi - step decay process it will be more difficult to collect all the decay products without increasing the detector acceptance .",
    "on the other hand , the multiple sets of tracks produced in the decay of a higher kk mode could be used to reduce backgrounds .",
    "lower - energy @xmath1 colliders such as babar , belle , and da@xmath150ne may also permit the discovery of one or more light hidden vectors .",
    "searches for a hidden vector based on continuum @xmath151 production at these colliders currently bound @xmath135 for @xmath152  @xcite .",
    "this limit is adapted from a babar search for @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is a light pseudoscalar decaying to @xmath155  @xcite . by expanding the search to include @xmath156 data from belle as well as multi - lepton final states",
    "it will be possible to investigate a significantly larger range of hidden vector models  @xcite , including multiple hidden vector kk modes .",
    "further improvements can also be expected from other low - energy searches such as the kloe experiment at da@xmath150ne  @xcite .",

    "these rates can potentially be significant when the resonant kk vectors are able decay efficiently into lighter hidden - sector modes .",
    "compared to minimal abelian hidden scenarios where the hidden vector is only able to decay to the sm , resonant production in this case is proportional to @xmath160 rather than @xmath161 , and the heavier kk modes can be relatively broad making them more likely to overlap with the center - of - mass energy",
    ". the typical signature of a heavier vector kk mode will be multiple charged tracks with a relatively spherical distribution , and can be similar to non - abelian hidden sectors  @xcite .",

    "light hidden sectors have received attention recently in the context of models of dark matter  ( dm ) motivated by new results from pamela , fermi , and dama .",
    "all three of these experiments observe signals that can potentially be due to dm .",
    "however , the standard picture of a weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) undergoing thermal freeze - out does not appear to explain the data  @xcite .",
    "instead a dm particle with mass above a few hundred gev coupling to a light hidden force with an enhanced annihilation ( or decay ) rate in the local region can account for the signals  @xcite .",
    "this scenario has been realized in the context of supersymmetric hidden sectors  @xcite , and with a few modifications can also apply in the present scenario .",
    "a simple option is for the dm to consist of a dirac fermion confined to the uv brane with a mass near the electroweak scale and charged only under @xmath0 .",
    "this state will annihilate primarily to pairs of @xmath0 zero - mode gauge bosons with a significant rate that depends on the fermion mass and charge , and possibly enhanced at late times through the sommerfeld mechanism .",
    "these gauge bosons will in turn decay to sm states .",
    "this dm candidate will also acquire a direct coupling to the sm @xmath48 through gauge kinetic mixing , although with a strongly suppressed coupling .",
    "let us also point out that to be consistent with bounds from dm direct detection searches , the gauge kinetic mixing must be somewhat small , @xmath162  @xcite .",
    "the primary modification required for this dm picture is in the mechanism to generate the dm density in the early universe . at temperatures well above the hidden ir scale",
    "the five - dimensional rs geometry is replaced by ads - schwarzschild  @xcite .",
    "the transition from this thermal state to the usual truncated ads rs spacetime occurs at temperatures near the ir brane scale .",
    "depending on the mechanism of radius stabilization this transition can be too slow to ever complete in the calculable regime of @xmath125  @xcite .",
    "this possibility will be avoided in the present scenario if primordial inflation never reheated above the hidden ir brane scale , so that the ads - schwarzschild geometry was never realized after inflation .",
    "this is consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis provided the reheating temperature was greater than about @xmath163  @xcite . with even a very low reheating temperature",
    "the dm density could arise non - thermally from inflaton ( or related ) decays  @xcite . at higher reheating temperatures approaching a gev ,",
    "the dm could have partially rethermalized enough to generate a significant relic abundance  @xcite .    if one is willing to give up on explaining the leptonic signals of pamela or fermi with dm , it is also possible to have a light dm state within the hidden sector that is produced thermally  @xcite .",
    "such candidates have been considered as possible explanations for dama  @xcite and the integral @xmath164 line  @xcite .",
    "a simple option is a dirac fermion on the hidden ir brane , but other possibilities exist .",
    "for example , instead of a minimal hidden gauge group of @xmath0 one could consider a larger hidden sector ; one possibility would be a warped implementation of the exact - parity or mirror matter models  @xcite .",
    "if the mirror sector resides in the hidden bulk then the dm may be stabilized by an approximate hidden baryon number symmetry and additional couplings between the two sectors could result  @xcite .",
    "in this work we have investigated a light abelian hidden sector in an extended rs model .",
    "the hidden @xmath0 symmetry propagates in a separate warped bulk and couples to the sm only via localized operators on a common uv brane . with a hidden ir scale of order a gev the low - energy spectrum consists of the sm plus",
    "a tower of gev spaced hidden kk vectors .",
    "the latter acquire a coupling to the sm via uv - localized mixing with sm hypercharge .",
    "relative to the vector zero mode , the couplings of the heavier kk modes are only suppressed by a moderate logarithmic factor suggesting that they too can give rise to observable signals .",
    "although we defer a detailed analysis of the bounds on such a scenario to a future work  @xcite , a preliminary analysis suggests that such a spectrum is consistent with existing constraints .",
    "we find that the lowest kk modes can potentially decay primarily to the sm .",
    "higher modes will decay in a hidden cascade down to the lowest modes , which then decay back to the sm . in principle",
    "the lightest modes can be reconstructed directly as resonances , while the heavier modes can be reconstructed indirectly from their multi - body final states .",
