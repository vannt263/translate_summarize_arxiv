    "information - theoretic properties are used in recent years for the study of quantum mechanical systems @xcite . in the present work",
    "we carry out a systematic study of shannon information @xmath3 , onicescu information energy @xmath4 , order parameter @xmath5 and complexity @xmath6 , in atoms with @xmath7 . in previous work @xcite we proposed a universal property of @xmath3 for density distributions of nuclei , electrons in atoms and valence electrons in atomic clusters .",
    "this property has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of particles of the system and the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 depend on the system under consideration . recently @xcite we have obtained the same form for systems of correlated bosons in a trap . in the present paper",
    "we employ very accurate spin - independent atomic wave functions obtained by bunge et al @xcite , by applying the roothaan - hartree - fock method ( rhf ) to calculate analytical self consistent - field atomic wave functions .",
    "thus we verify the above relation for atoms , which was obtained in the past @xcite employing another set of electron wave functions .",
    "thus we obtain a framework to be used as a basis for further work on information - theoretic properties of atoms .",
    "an interesting question is the effect of the electron - electron correlations on @xmath3 and relation ( [ eq : ini ] ) , which could be answered in future research .",
    "we focus our attention on the problem of similarity index based on the concept of an information distance .",
    "the concept of similarity is an old one and related to the distinction between two or more objects @xcite .",
    "specifically , in our paper we study two candidates connected with the concept of similarity or information distance .",
    "the first one is the kullback - leibler relative entropy @xmath12 ( and also the symmetrized kullback distance @xmath13 ) and the second one is the jensen shannon divergence @xmath14 .",
    "thus we are able to compare various density distributions obtained using various models .",
    "it turns out that @xmath3 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 measures are useful for this purpose .",
    "the framework developed in the present work for @xmath3 together with @xmath15 obtained previously @xcite with rigorous inequalities holding for @xmath3 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 enables us to calculate the so called complexity measure @xmath18 introduced in @xcite .",
    "our procedure leads to the interesting result that complexity as function of @xmath0 shows shell effects at closed shells atoms i.e. for the above atoms complexity decreases with respect to neighboring atoms .",
    "the outline of our paper is the following : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we describe measures of information content of a quantum system together with information distances of two probability distributions and a complexity measure recently proposed . in sec . [ sec:3 ] we present our formalism , while sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] contains our numerical results and discussion .",
    "[ sec:5 ] is a summary of the paper .",
    "finally sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] contains our comments on the importance of our results on complexity .",
    "the shannon information entropy @xcite @xmath16 in position - space may be defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electron density distribution normalized to unity .",
    "the corresponding information entropy @xmath17 in the momentum space representation is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the momentum density distribution normalized to unity studied in @xcite . in position - space @xmath16",
    "determines the extent of electron delocalization , since it tends to a maximum as the distribution flattens out and deviates from this maximum when structure is introduced in @xmath20 . in momentum - space",
    "a maximum in @xmath17 corresponds to a delocalized distribution in momentum - space @xcite .",
    "the total information entropy is given by @xmath23 where @xmath3 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 obey the following rigorous inequalities @xcite    @xmath24    the lower and the upper limits can be written , for density distributions normalized to one @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mean square radius and @xmath27 is the kinetic energy .",
    "another measure of information content of a quantum system is the concept of information energy @xmath4 introduced by onicescu in an attempt to define a finer measure of dispersion distribution than that of shannon information entropy @xcite . for a discrete probability distribution @xmath28",
    ", @xmath4 is defined as @xmath29 which is extended for a continuous density distribution @xmath30 as @xmath31 so far , only the mathematical aspects of the concept have been developed , while the physical aspects have been ignored .",
    "a recent study of @xmath4 for atomic nuclei has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "the meaning of ( [ eq : onicont ] ) can be seen by the following simple argument : for a gaussian distribution of mean value @xmath32 , standard deviation @xmath33 and normalized density @xmath34\\ ] ] relation ( [ eq : onicont ] ) gives @xmath35\\,dx=\\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\ ] ] @xmath4 is maximum if one of the @xmath36 equals 1 and all the others are equal to zero i.e. @xmath37 , while @xmath4 is minimum when @xmath38 , hence @xmath39 ( total disorder ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath4 becomes minimum for equal probabilities ( total disorder ) , by analogy with thermodynamics , it has been called information energy , although it does not have the dimension of energy @xcite .",
    "it is seen from ( [ eq : oninorm ] ) that the greater the information energy , the more concentrated is the probability distribution , while the information content decreases .",
    "thus one can define a measure of information content analogous to shannon s @xmath3 by the relation @xmath40 relation ( [ eq : onicont ] ) is extended for a 3-dimensional spherically symmetric density distribution @xmath41 : @xmath42 in position and momentum space respectively , where @xmath43 is the corresponding density distribution in momentum space .",
    "@xmath44 has dimension of inverse volume , while @xmath45 of volume .",
    "thus the product @xmath46 is dimensionless and can serve as a measure of concentration ( or information content ) of a quantum system .",
    "it is also seen from ( [ eq : oninorm ] ) that @xmath4 increases as @xmath33 decreases ( or concentration increases ) and shannon s information entropy ( or uncertainty ) @xmath3 decreases .",
    "thus @xmath3 and @xmath4 are reciprocal . in order to be able to compare them",
    ", we redefine the quantity @xmath47 by @xmath48 as a measure of the information content of a quantum system in both position and momentum spaces .",
    "landsberg @xcite defined the order parameter @xmath5 ( or disorder @xmath49 ) as @xmath50 where @xmath3 is the information entropy ( actual ) of the system and @xmath15 the maximum entropy accessible to the system .",
    "thus the concepts of entropy and disorder are decoupled and it is possible for the entropy and order to increase simultaneously . it is noted that @xmath51 corresponds to perfect order and predictability , while @xmath52 means complete disorder and randomness .    in @xcite a measure of complexity @xmath18 was defined of the form @xmath53 which is called the `` simple complexity of disorder strength @xmath54 and order strength @xmath55 '' . when @xmath56 and @xmath57 `` complexity '' is an increasing function of `` disorder '' , and we have a measure of category i ( fig.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath58 and @xmath59 , `` complexity '' is an increasing function of `` order '' and we have a measure of category iii .",
    "when both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are nonvanishing and positive ( @xmath57 , @xmath59 ) , `` complexity '' vanishes at zero `` disorder '' and zero `` order '' and has a maximum of @xmath60 at @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this is complexity of category ii according to @xcite .",
    "several cases for both @xmath54 and @xmath55 non - negative are shown in fig.2 of @xcite where @xmath18 is plotted as function of @xmath49 . in the present work we can find @xmath63 or @xmath64 as function of @xmath0 .",
    "thus we are able to plot the dependence of @xmath18 on the atomic number @xmath0 .",
    "the kullback - leibler relative information entropy @xmath12 @xcite for any probability distributions @xmath65 is defined by @xmath66 which for continuous probability distributions is defined as @xmath67 ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq : eq7 ] ) can be easily extended for 3-dimensional systems .",
    "@xmath12 measures the difference of distance of @xmath68 from the reference ( or a priori ) distribution @xmath69 .",
    "it satisfies : @xmath70 for any distributions @xmath71 .",
    "it is a measure which quantifies the distinguishability ( or distance ) of @xmath68 from @xmath69 , employing a well - known concept in standard information theory . in other words",
    "it describes how close is @xmath68 to @xmath69 by carrying out observations or coin tossing , namely trials @xmath72 ( in the sense described in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the distance @xmath12 does not satisfy the triangle inequality and in addition is i ) not symmetric",
    "ii ) unbounded and iii ) not always well defined @xcite . to avoid these difficulties rao and lin @xcite introduced a symmetrized version of @xmath12 @xcite , the jensen - shannon divergence @xmath73 where @xmath74 stands for shannon s entropy",
    "@xmath14 is minimum for @xmath75 and maximum when @xmath76 and @xmath77 are two distinct distributions , when @xmath78 . in our case",
    "@xmath14 can be easily generalized for continuous density distributions .",
    "for @xmath14 minimum the two states represented by @xmath76 and @xmath77 are completely indistinguishable , while for @xmath14 maximum they are completely distinguishable .",
    "the amount of distinguishability can be further examined by using wooters criterion @xcite .",
    "two probability distributions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are distinguishable after @xmath72 trials @xmath79 if and only if @xmath80 .",
    "the present work is a first step to examine the problem of comparison of probability distributions ( for atoms and various models ) which is an area well developed in statistics , known as information geometry @xcite .",
    "the key quantities in our work are the density distribution @xmath81 and the momentum distribution @xmath82 . in general the calculation of @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    "presuppose the knowledge of the one body density matrix @xmath83 which is defined as    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the wave function that describes the system under consideration ( in the present work the atom ) .",
    "@xmath20 is just the diagonal part of the @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 while @xmath22 is the fourier transform of the one - body density matrix i.e. @xmath88 d{\\bf r}_1 ' d{\\bf r}_1\\ ] ] in the framework of the hartree - fock approximation , which is applied in the present work , @xmath85 has the well known form of a slater determinant ( electrons of the atoms consist a system which obeys the fermi - dirac statistics ) .",
    "it is easy to prove that in that case @xmath86 takes the following simple form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the single particle wave function describing the electrons in an atom .",
    "the index @xmath91 runs over all @xmath0 single particle states .",
    "now @xmath81 and @xmath82 are written as @xmath92 @xmath93 where @xmath94 the wave functions @xmath90 and @xmath95 are decomposed in the usual form @xmath96 and @xmath97 the radial momentum wave function @xmath98 is related to the radial wave function in coordinate space through @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a spherical bessel function .    in the present work we consider very accurate spin - independent atomic wave functions obtained by bunge _",
    "et al _ @xcite by applying the roothaan - hartree - fock method to calculate analytical self - consistent - field atomic wave function . in this approach",
    "the radial atomic orbitals @xmath101 are expanded as a finite superposition of primitive radial functions @xmath102 where the normalized primitive basis @xmath103 is taken as a slater - type orbital set , @xmath104 where the normalization factor @xmath105 is given by @xmath106^{1/2 } \\label{}\\ ] ] and @xmath107 is the principal quantum number , @xmath108 is the orbital exponent , and @xmath109 is the azimuthal quantum number .    in general @xmath81 is not spherically symmetric and depends in addition on the angle @xmath110 . in the present work we consider @xmath81 averaged spherically ( the same holds also for @xmath82 ) .",
    "the shannon information entropy in position - space , momentum space and in total are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sr ] ) , ( [ eq : sk ] ) and ( [ eq : stot ] ) respectively .",
    "another quantity which gives information about the localization ( delocalization ) of the atomic systems is the local shannon entropy defined ( in position- and momentum - space respectively ) as follows @xmath111    in order to formulate the concept of the similarity or information distance between two atomic systems with @xmath112 and @xmath113 the corresponding density distributions , the kullback - leibler relative entropy is defined as @xmath114 which may be interpreted as a measure of deviation of @xmath115 from @xmath113 .",
    "the corresponding symmetrized kullback distance @xmath13 is @xmath116 the physical meaning of the kullback distance is very clear . @xmath12 is equal to zero for two identical species and approaches infinity as the difference between @xmath112 and @xmath113 increases . @xmath12 and @xmath13 in momentum space are defined using @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the same way .",
    "the jensen - shannon divergence entropy is defined as follows @xmath119 the physical meaning of @xmath14 is similar to @xmath13 , while the definition in momentum space is defined using @xmath82 in the same way .",
    "another aspect of our work is to compare rhf densities with those of the work @xcite in the framework of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "more specifically we compare the density distributions of the electrons originating from the paper of bunge et.al .",
    "@xcite ( used in the present work ) with the phenomenological one of sagar et.al .",
    "@xcite who employed the phenomenological form @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the first ionization potential of the system .",
    "we also compare rhf densities with those of the well known thomas - fermi model . for the density distribution we use the simple form obtained by sommerfeld @xcite where @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath127 is calculated from the normalization condition @xmath128",
    "in fig .  [ fig:1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) we plot the shannon information entropy both in coordinate - space ( @xmath16 ) and momentum - space ( @xmath17 ) as functions of the electron number @xmath0 . in @xmath16",
    "coexist an average increasing behavior and also an obvious shell effect structure around fully filled shells , such as he , ne , ar , kr where there are minima of the curve @xmath129 .",
    "the physical meaning of that behavior is that @xmath41 for these atoms is the most compact one when compared to the neighboring atoms .",
    "the values of @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) ) show a monotonic increase with @xmath0 .",
    "however there is also in the behavior of @xmath17 a local shell effect .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( a ) we plot the total shannon information entropy @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath3 is a strictly monotonic increasing function of @xmath0 with only two exceptions for ni and pd .",
    "these exceptions are due to the fact that @xmath16 and @xmath17 depend on the arrangement of the electrons in shells .",
    "there is a delicate balance between @xmath16 and @xmath17 resulting in the general rule that @xmath130 is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath0 except in ni and pd where the electron arrangement in shells is such that the decrease of the value of @xmath16 can not be balanced by a corresponding increase of @xmath17 .",
    "thus the monotonicity of @xmath3 is slightly violated .",
    "a shell effect is also obvious in the behavior of @xmath3 i.e. minima at closed shells .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( b ) illustrates the trend of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath131 .",
    "the best linear fit is also plotted in the same figure where @xmath132 .",
    "it is noted that this result is not new but has been already obtained using other wave functions in @xcite . in the present work",
    "we verify this result with rhf electron wave functions @xcite and we employ this framework for new calculations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) we plot the complexity measure @xmath18 in atoms for various values of parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "it is seen that for all sets of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath18 shows qualitatively the same trend as function of @xmath0 i.e. it fluctuates around an average value and shows local minima for atoms with closed shells .",
    "these results compare favorably with intuition i.e. complexity is less at closed shells which can be considered more compact than neighboring nuclei and consequently less complex .",
    "it is noted that this result comes from a procedure which is not trivial i.e. first we calculate @xmath81 and @xmath82 , second we find @xmath130 from the shannon definition and @xmath15 employing rigorous inequalities and third we obtain the complexity measure introduced in @xcite .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( a ) displays the values of the onicescu information content @xmath47 versus @xmath0 .",
    "the first three maxima correspond to the fully closed shells ( he , ne and ar ) where in the case of the next closed shell ( kr ) a local maximum exists . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( b ) we plot in the same footing the onicescu information content @xmath47 and the ionization potential @xmath121 .",
    "it is indicated that @xmath47 and @xmath121 are correlated in the sense that there is a similarity in the trend of values of @xmath47 and @xmath121 as functions of @xmath0 .",
    "this similarity is more obvious in regions of small @xmath0 where linear relations @xmath133 can be extracted for regions li - ne and na - ar .",
    "however , it seems that , there is no universal relation between them .",
    "there are many entropic measures of spread of probability densities e.g. @xmath3 , @xmath4 e.t.c .",
    "but researchers prefer @xmath3 because of its unique properties , while @xmath4 was introduced by onicescu as a sensitive measure of information .",
    "however , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are different functionals of the density and their relation is difficult to find .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( a ) we display the symmetrized kullback distance between the rhf density distributions and the approximate one given by the relation ( [ d - sag-1 ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that the symmetrized kullback distance @xmath13 becomes minimum in the case of the fully closed shells atoms .",
    "this physically means that the approximate @xmath81 ( [ d - sag-1 ] ) works better in closed shell atoms than the open shells .",
    "in addition there is an increasing trend with @xmath0 .",
    "that means that in general @xmath134 ( [ d - sag-1 ] ) fails to describe the structure of heavier atoms .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( b ) displays the jensen - shannon divergence entropy @xmath14 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the behavior is almost similar to @xmath13 and the comments are the same . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( c ) we display @xmath14 versus @xmath13 .",
    "there is a linear relation of the two information distances .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ( a ) we display @xmath13 as an information distance between the rhf density distribution and the thomas - fermi density distribution given by the relation ( [ tf - dd ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the values of @xmath13 decrease with @xmath0 .",
    "this is expected because the thomas - fermi approximation works well in heavier atoms .",
    "so the two distributions are closer in heavier atoms than in the light ones . the local maxima of the values of @xmath13 correspond to the closed shell atoms .",
    "this deviation is due to the absence of shell effect character of the thomas - fermi distribution compared to the realistic rhf density distribution . fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ( b ) displays @xmath14 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the behavior is almost similar to @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ( c ) we display @xmath14 versus @xmath13 .    the local shannon entropy ( [ eq : localshannon ] ) both in position- and momentum - space is presented in fig .  [ fig:7 ] for various atoms .",
    "as it is pointed out in @xcite in systems with density @xmath135 near the nucleus the local shannon entropy in position - space @xmath136 will be negative , thus the contribution to the integral from this region will serve to lower its value ( localization ) while in region where @xmath137 , such as the valence , contribution to the shannon entropy in position - space will be positive which leads to delocalization .",
    "in contrast the local shannon entropy in momentum - space @xmath138 is always positive .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath139 for all @xmath140 .",
    "so , there is no negative contribution to the shannon entropy in momentum - space .",
    "it is worth , discussing the behavior of the momentum distribution and as a consequence the local shannon entropy , to mention that the precise knowledge of the electron momentum distribution is important for atoms used as a dark matter or neutrino detectors .",
    "in such a kind of experiments the single particle wave function in momentum space or in general the momentum density of the electrons are the main ingredient of the relative cross sections .",
    "the trend ( localization , delocalization , etc ) of the electron wave function or momentum distribution affect considerably the values of the cross sections , especially in experiments where the production of electrons in neutralino - nucleus or neutrino - nucleus collisions are investigated @xcite .",
    "finally in table  [ tab:1 ] we tabulate for the sake of reference the quantities @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath3 , @xmath15 , @xmath5 , and @xmath47 for each atom as functions of @xmath0 .",
    "we include the results for hydrogen which are known exactly i.e. @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "in previous works the universal relation @xmath143 was proposed for the information entropy @xmath3 as function of the number of particles @xmath9 in atoms , nuclei , atomic clusters and correlated bosons in a trap i.e. systems of various sizes , with various interactions , obeying different statistics ( fermions and bosons ) . in this paper",
    "we verify the above relation employing rhf electron density distributions for atoms .",
    "thus we construct a basis in order to study some information - theoretic properties of atoms .",
    "specifically , we calculate the symmetrized kullback - leibler relative entropy @xmath13 and the jensen - shannon divergence @xmath14 which serve as measures of information distance of probabilities distributions and are useful to compare electron distributions according to various models .",
    "two examples are given .",
    "we compare rhf density distributions first with an asymptotic density depending on the ionization potential and second with the well - known thomas fermi approximation .",
    "we also obtain onicescu s information energy @xmath4 and its corresponding information measure , which correlates with the ionization potential .",
    "finally , we calculate a recently proposed complexity measure @xmath18 inspired by landsberg s order parameter @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that the function @xmath144 shows the interesting feature that for closed shells atoms is smaller than neighboring ones .",
    "this indicates that closed shells atoms are less complex than neighboring ones , which compares favorably with expectations according to intuition .",
    "there is a long debate in the literature on order , disorder , complexity and organization for physical , biological and other systems .",
    "a generally accepted quantitative definition of complexity does not exist so far .",
    "more work has been carried out in classical systems and much less in quantum ones .",
    "our aim is to contribute in this debate examining complexity in atoms ( for the first time to our knowledge ) adopting a particular definition of complexity measure according to shiner , davison and landsberg @xcite .",
    "the reason for our choice is that we can easily calculate it for atoms ( and we intend to calculate it for other quantum systems as well ) , because our previous experience with information entropy facilitates this .",
    "more work is needed in the future by using the so called statistical measure of complexity of lopez - ruiz , manchini and calbet @xcite    in",
    "@xcite the authors studied disorder and complexity in an ideal fermi gas of electrons .",
    "they observed that for a small number of electrons landsberg s order parameter @xmath5 is small , while @xmath5 increases as one pumps electrons into the system and the energy levels fill up .",
    "this result is in a way counter - intuitive and indicates that as particles are added in a quantum - mechanical system , the system becomes more ordered .",
    "this result was further corroborated in @xcite by calculating @xmath5 as function of the number of particles @xmath9 for realistic quantum systems i.e. atomic nuclei and atomic clusters . in @xcite @xmath145",
    "was obtained for bosonic systems as well ( correlated atoms in a trap ) .",
    "all cases show the same trend for @xmath145 i.e. @xmath5 is an increasing function of @xmath9 . however , if one is interested how complex ( or organized ) is a system , the information entropy @xmath3 ( sometimes used as a measure of disorder ) or the order parameter @xmath5 ( or disorder @xmath146 ) are not suitable measures of complexity or organization .",
    "we note that these terms are interrelated from a semantic point of view",
    ". @xmath18 has the advantage of being a convex measure of order ( or disorder ) i.e. it vanishes for highly ordered and disordered systems . in other words , it satisfies the `` one - hump '' criterion for statistical complexity measures .",
    "thus @xmath18 is obtained by multiplying a measure of `` order '' by a measure of `` disorder '' .",
    "a simple example is a perfect crystal which has perfect order and an ideal gas with complete disorder . both have zero complexity and fit well with the definition of @xmath18 .    in the present paper",
    "we find that complexity is less at closed shell atoms .",
    "this satisfies our intuition , at least does not contradict common sense and indicates that our procedure from electron densities to information entropy and maximum entropy to complexity measure @xmath18 is reasonable . the fact that @xmath18 fluctuates around an average value is new and interesting , because it shows that complexity of atoms does not increase as the atomic number @xmath0 increases . in other words , as one pumps electrons into the atom , the atom has not the ability to grow in complexity .",
    "the question is open what happens if atoms form molecules , molecules form more complex systems e.t.c .",
    "we mention that the question whether physical or biological systems have the ability for organized complexity without the intervention of an external factor or agent is a hot subject in the community of scientists interested in complexity and can be extrapolated even in philosophical questions .",
