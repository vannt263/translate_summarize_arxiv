    "polythiophenes ( t@xmath1 ) and their functional derivatives belong among the most studied compounds among @xmath2-conjugated polymers due to their potential in organic electronics , perepichka:2009,*mishra:2009,*perepichka:2005,*klauk:2006 since they combine remarkable conductivity with excellent thermo- and chemo - stability .",
    "detailed experimental investigations of polythiophenes have shown that their optical properties are closely related to the structure of the polymer backbone : for instance , the @xmath3@xmath3 transition energies are approximately a linear function of @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is the number of thiophene rings in the polymer.@xcite bandgap computations confirmed validity of this semi - empirical rule for short polymers as well as its violation for longer chains.themans:1989,hutchinson:2003,*zade:2006    for a direct comparison with experiments it is , however , crucial to calculate the vibrationally resolved spectra.jacquemin:2012,avilaferrer:2013 here , we therefore determine the vibrationally resolved emission spectra of oligothiophenes t@xmath1 with two to five rings , i.e. , @xmath5 , since the vibrational line shape is changing drastically in this range of @xmath1.@xcite    the cost of computing a vibrationally resolved spectrum is much higher than the cost of vertical transition energy calculations since the spectrum calculation requires the knowledge of the involved potential energy surfaces ( pess ) . as it is often difficult to describe pess accurately in terms of analytical functions , a popular approach , especially for larger molecules is to approximate the pess by harmonic potentials with respect to certain reference structures.biczysko:2011,tatchen:2008,*avillaferrer:2012,*cerezo:2013",
    "the absorption and emission line shapes of dithiophene have been calculated by stendardo  _ _ et al.__@xcite using a double - well potential describing the torsional mode and global harmonic approximation in the remaining degrees of freedom . in order to get a good correspondence with experiment ,",
    "the authors show that an appropriate choice of these reference structures is essential , e.g. , the ground pes reference structure for the emission spectrum calculation is found using symmetry constraints .",
    "alternative strategy employs trajectory - based methods in combination with an on - the - fly ( otf ) _ ab initio _",
    "( ai ) scheme , in which the required potential energies , forces , and hessians are computed with an electronic structure package during the dynamics .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that _ ab initio _ semiclassical dynamics provides a powerful spectroscopic tool useful , e.g. , for evaluating internal conversion rates@xcite or vibrationally resolved spectra.tatchen_pollak:2009,ceotto_aspuruguzik:2009a,*ceotto_aspuruguzik:2009b,*ceotto:2011a,*ceotto:2011b,wong:2011 not only do the evolving trajectories provide an intuitive classical - like picture of the underlying physical and chemical processes , but via interference , they also partially account for the most important nuclear quantum effects .",
    "the overall computational cost , however , restricts almost all of these methods to small systems .    as a result ,",
    "one is forced to strike a balance between physical accuracy and computational efficiency . in this spirit",
    ", otf - ai gaussian wave packet propagation can provide a useful compromise . within the thawed gaussian approximation ( tga ) ,",
    "the nuclear wave packet is guided by a central classical trajectory , which feels the anharmonicity of the potential , while its width is propagated using the local harmonic approximation.heller:1975 hence , the effects of anharmonic or double - well potentials are partially captured by tga ; moreover , the otf - ai framework obviates the need of an a priori knowledge of the landscape of the final pes .",
    "more importantly , due to its moderate computational cost , tga can treat all vibrational degrees of freedom on an equal footing even in large systems , while in smaller systems , it permits using a more accurate electronic structure description .",
    "a well - known shortcoming of the tga is that it captures accurately only the short - time dynamics and , therefore , only describes the broad spectral features.@xcite nevertheless , due to interaction with solvent and other phenomena contributing to spectral broadening , the experimental spectra are also typically not fully vibrationally resolved .",
    "although rewarding , a mere reproduction of an experimental spectrum , no matter how accurate , does not provide a deeper insight into the associated physical and chemical processes ; it is a careful analysis of the simulation that can provide such information .",
    "the extraction of this essential information , which is often omitted , can be as difficult as the simulation itself , especially for larger molecules .",
    "for example , explanation of changes in the vibrational line shape of the spectra due to increasing polymer chain length , which is done here for oligothiophenes , increases drastically the complexity of the analysis .",
    "therefore , in addition to providing an efficient computational protocol for computing vibrationally resolved electronic spectra we also present a systematic approach for extracting the essential information about the underlying dynamics .",
    "in the time - dependent approach pioneered by heller,@xcite the molecular spectrum is determined by the fourier transform of an appropriate correlation function . within the electric dipole approximation , time - dependent perturbation theory , and rotating wave approximation ,",
    "the correlation function required for computing the emission spectrum is @xmath6 .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : c_em_simplified ] ) states@xcite that propagation of the ground vibrational state of @xmath8 on @xmath18 determines the correlation function @xmath19 , and hence the spectrum , which is obtained via a fourier transform @xmath20where @xmath21 for the line shape and @xmath22 for the emission spectrum .",
    "prefactor @xmath23 is a constant factor depending on the type of spectra.lami:2011,biczysko:2011,avilaferrer:2013 since it is constant , in our calculations @xmath23 was chosen so that the spectra are normalized in the @xmath24 norm , i.e. , the highest spectral peak is of unit intensity .",
    "the celebrated _ _ thawed gaussian approximation__heller:1975,lee_heller:1982 of heller belongs among the earliest practical semiclassical approaches to quantum dynamics .",
    "the main idea is exceedingly simple  since a gaussian wave packet ( gwp ) evolving in a globally harmonic potential retains its functional form , one expects that propagating a single thawed gwp using a local harmonic approximation for the potential can provide a reasonable approximation in many applications , especially when the dynamics of interst is ultrafast .",
    "although the accuracy of the single gwp description is clearly limited , it can provide the most important information beyond that contained in static calculations employing globally harmonic approximation for the potential.grossmann:2006,baranger_schellhaass:2001    within tga , the evolving gwp is assumed in the form @xmath25\\bigr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a normalization constant , @xmath27 denotes the gwp s phase - space center , @xmath28 is a real , symmetric width matrix , and @xmath29 represents an overall phase factor .",
    "note that @xmath29 is a time - dependent complex number the imaginary part of which guarantees normalization of @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the key ingredient of the method consists in expressing the potential @xmath32 in the _ local harmonic approximation _ ( lha ) .",

    "the required potential energy surface is generated consecutively at each propagation step by any of the standard electronic structure packages ( see sec .  [",

    "in addition to classical trajectory propagation based only on force evaluation , tga requires to repeatedly evaluate the hessian @xmath36 along the evolving trajectory , since @xmath36 is needed@xcite for propagating the stability matrix @xmath57 .",
    "the evolving gwp is properly defined only in the subspace of the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule of interest .",

    "we illustrate the procedure employed in the numerical calculations on a specific scenario of two , ground and excited pess , where the initial gwp corresponding to the ground vibrational state of the excited electronic pes is subsequently propagated on the ground electronic surface .",

    "the translational modes are projected out easily by shifting the center of mass to the origin of the cartesian frame .",

    "the associated computational costs can be alleviated by employing a hessian update scheme , within which the hessian is evaluated directly only once every @xmath88 steps and approximated at the remaining steps with an extrapolation method requiring gradients .",
    "note that these hessian update schemes are in the context of dynamics typically used for the propagation of the classical trajectory itself , e.g. , within the framework of higher - order predictor - corrector schemes ( see refs .   and and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast , in refs .  , , and as well as in the present work , approximative treatment of the hessian is used only for the propagation of @xmath57 . however , whereas in refs .  , , and the hessian update is based on extrapolation , in this work polynomial interpolation of order @xmath89 is used to obtain the hessian at intermediate steps",
    ". a hessian extrapolation update scheme would be convenient in cases for which analytical _ ab initio _ hessians are not available , e.g. , for absorption spectrum calculation .",

    "the influence of the interpolation procedure with @xmath101 on the gwp evolved with the tga is quantified in terms of fidelity  a quantity introduced by peres@xcite to measure sensitivity of quantum dynamics to perturbations . in our setting , the fidelity is defined as the squared magnitude of the time - dependent overlap of gwps propagated using the tga with and without interpolation : @xmath102 in the t@xmath98 case , e.g. , interpolating every four steps using the second order interpolation ( @xmath103 ) has almost no effect on the propagated gwp , while the otf - ai calculation is accelerated almost four times [ see fig .",

    "first , we decompose the set @xmath104 of all vibrational dofs into mutually disjoint subsets , where the dofs in different subsets can be thought of as approximately dynamically independent .",
    "second , we identify the dynamically most important dofs and then consider only those subsets of @xmath104 which contain at least one of these `` important '' dofs .",
    "to quantify the coupling between various dofs , we utilize the stability matrix to measure the _ information flow _ among individual dofs .",
