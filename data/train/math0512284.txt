    "a classical theme in differential geometry is the investigation of topological conditions that are necessary or sufficient for the existence of a particular kind of geometric structure on a given smooth manifold . in the context of riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature , this question has revealed a strong link between subtle differential topological invariants of smooth manifolds and their geometry . a prominent role in this context",
    "is played by an effective method for constructing metrics of positive scalar curvature described in the seminal work by gromov - lawson @xcite and schoen - yau @xcite : the class of smooth manifolds admitting metrics of positive scalar curvature is closed under surgery in codimension at least three .",
    "based on this principle , the existence question for positive scalar curvature metrics can be translated into a bordism problem that is then discussed with the help of powerful algebraic - topological means .",
    "the effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by the following result , which provides a complete classification of simply connected closed manifolds of dimension at least @xmath3 that admit metrics of positive scalar curvature .",

    "we will investigate the positive scalar curvature question in an equivariant context : given a closed smooth manifold @xmath4 equipped with a smooth action of a compact lie group @xmath10 , does @xmath4 admit a positive scalar curvature metric which is invariant under the @xmath10-action ? even if @xmath4 admits a ( nonequivariant ) metric of positive scalar curvature , this may be a nontrivial problem : brard bergery shows in @xcite , example 9.1 .",
    ", that averaging a positive scalar curvature metric over a group of symmetries may destroy the positivity of the scalar curvature .    if @xmath10 is finite and the action on @xmath4 is free , this problem is equivalent to asking whether @xmath11 , a closed manifold whose fundamental group is a certain extension of @xmath10 ( assuming that @xmath4 is connected ) , admits a metric of positive scalar curvature - and this is a nonequivariant question .",

    "this theorem only states that @xmath4 carries a riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature , but one easily checks that the construction in _ loc .",
    "_  yields a metric which is in fact also @xmath10-invariant .    the proofs of the lawson - yau theorem and of the gromov - lawson and stolz theorems differ in an essential way : the first one yields an explicit metric of positive scalar curvature .",
    "in contrast , the proofs of the latter are based on structure results for the oriented and spin bordism rings which rely on homotopy theoretic considerations . in particular",
    ", they do not provide a direct description of the positive scalar curvature metrics in question .",
    "important aspects of the equivariant positive scalar curvature problem were discussed by brard bergery in @xcite . in this paper",
    "the kazdan - warner trichotomy , the yamabe problem , the index obstruction to positive scalar curvature and the surgery principle for constructing metrics of positive scalar curvature are formulated in an equivariant context .",
    "further elaborations of the index theoretic obstruction in the case of @xmath1-manifolds are carried out by lott in @xcite .",
    "rosenberg - weinberger @xcite provide an ad - hoc discussion of an equivariant bordism principle for constructing metrics of positive scalar curvature on simply connected manifolds which are invariant under spin preserving @xmath12-actions , see theorem 2.3 . in _ loc .",
    "cit_. however , the proof contained in this paper requires more assumptions than stated in the theorem ( see the discussion following corollary [ zetpe ] below ) .",

    "part of the nonequivariant discussion can be translated more or less directly to the equivariant context .",
    "this applies in particular to the surgery principle of gromov - lawson and schoen - yau .",
    "the paper @xcite formulates an equivariant analogue of this fundamental result ( see @xcite , theorem 11.1 ) without proof . in section [ equivgl ] of our work",
    ", we will recapitulate the essential steps of the argument in @xcite and will explain how they translate to an equivariant setting .",
    "the following section [ bordism ] is devoted to a proof of the first main result , a general bordism principle for constructing equivariant positive scalar curvature metrics .",
    "* theorem a*.    let @xmath13 be a compact connected oriented @xmath10-bordism between the closed @xmath10-manifolds @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "assume the following :    * the cohomogeneity of @xmath13 is at least @xmath2 , * the inclusion of maximal orbits @xmath16 is a nonequivariant @xmath0-equivalence ( i.e.  a bijection on @xmath17 , an isomorphism on @xmath18 and a surjection on @xmath19 ) , * each singular stratum of codimension @xmath0 in @xmath13 meets @xmath15 .",
    "then , if @xmath14 admits a @xmath10-invariant metric of positive scalar curvature , the same is true for @xmath15 .",
    "this statement makes clear that the bordism principle for constructing equivariant metrics of positive scalar curvature metrics does definitely not require a strong gap hypothesis as envisaged in @xcite , remark 2.4 , where the authors assume that for any two closed subgroups @xmath20 with @xmath21 , the codimension of each component of @xmath22 contained in the closure of @xmath23 is either @xmath24 or at least @xmath25 in @xmath23 ( here @xmath22 denotes the set of points in @xmath13 whose isotropy groups are conjugate to @xmath26 ) .",
    "our theorem a is almost a direct analogue of the corresponding nonequivariant result ( see @xcite , theorem 3.3 ) .",
    "in particular the dimension restriction i. ) and the connectivity restriction for the inclusion @xmath27 stated in point ii . ) translate to analogous requirements in the nonequivariant setting if @xmath28 . however , if @xmath10 is not trivial , we need an additional assumption on codimension-@xmath0 singular strata .",
    "the plausibility of such an assumption is illustrated in proposition [ illustrate ] : any equivariant handle decomposition of @xmath12-bordisms @xmath13 with codimension-@xmath0 fixed point components disjoint from @xmath15 contain handles of codimension @xmath24 or @xmath0 ( independent of the connectivity of the map @xmath16 ) .",
    "this points towards a fundamental limitation of the method of equivariant handle decompositions to construct equivariant metrics of positive scalar curvature .",
    "theorem a is useful for constructing equivariant metrics of positive scalar curvature only if it can be combined with powerful structure results for geometric equivariant bordism groups , which imply that the manifold @xmath14 in theorem a can be assumed to admit an equivariant positive scalar curvature metric under some general assumptions on the manifold @xmath15 .",
    "two main difficulties occur at this point .",
    "firstly , explicit geometric generators of equivariant bordism groups are known only in a very limited number of cases .",
    "secondly , whereas conditions i. ) and ii . ) in theorem a can be achieved under fairly general assumptions on the manifold @xmath15 ( by performing appropriate surgeries on @xmath29 - cf .",

    ", we shall present a way to avoid the difficulties inherent in condition iii . )",
    "if @xmath30 and the @xmath10-action on @xmath13 is fixed point free . the idea we use is to alter a given bordism @xmath13 by cutting out equivariant tubes connecting @xmath15 with each of the codimension-@xmath0 singular strata in @xmath13 that are disjoint from @xmath15 .",
    "this replaces the bordism @xmath13 and the manifold @xmath15 by other manifolds @xmath31 and @xmath32 so that each codimension-@xmath0 singular stratum in @xmath31 meets @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , theorem a can be applied to @xmath31 ( after some more manipulations of @xmath31 , but we omit these details here ) .",
    "we must now understand how @xmath15 can be recovered from @xmath32 .",
    "a closer inspection of the situation shows that @xmath32 is obtained from @xmath15 by adding certain codimension-@xmath0 singular strata with finite isotropies .",
    "conversely , @xmath15 can be reconstructed from @xmath32 by a dehn - like codimension-@xmath0 surgery process that removes these additional singular strata and puts back free ones instead .",
    "the examination of this surgery step is the content of section [ genial ] . in theorem [ heikel ] of this section",
    "we show by a somewhat involved geometric argument that this surgery step preserves the existence of @xmath1-invariant positive scalar curvature metrics under fairly general assumptions .",
    "roughly speaking , we replace the `` bending outwards '' process in the surgery step due to gromov - lawson and schoen - yau by a `` bending inwards '' process .",
    "we remark that this kind of positive scalar curvature preserving codimension-@xmath0 surgery only works under the additional @xmath1-symmetry .    arguing in this rather roundabout manner , assumption iii . ) of theorem a is no longer a true obstacle against the construction of equivariant positive scalar curvature metrics on fixed point free @xmath1-manifolds . in combination with a classical theorem of ossa @xcite , which states that fixed point free oriented @xmath1-manifolds satisfying condition @xmath33 ( cf .",
    "definition [ conditionce ] ) are oriented @xmath1-boundaries , we get the following equivariant version of the gromov - lawson theorem stated above .",

    "we remark that no additional assumption on codimension-@xmath0 singular strata in @xmath4 is needed in theorem b. it is not clear at present to what extent ossa s theorem can be generalized to the spin case , so that we will not discuss the corresponding @xmath1-equivariant analogue of stolz theorem in this paper .",

    "our proof of this result is based on two observations .",
    "the first one is that we need to cancel only @xmath10-handles in @xmath13 of codimension less than @xmath25 so that the full power of a handle cancelation machinery is not necessary .",
    "the second - lemma [ codestimate ] below - is that the codimensions of @xmath10-handles occurring in @xmath13 are related to the codimensions of the singular strata to which they are attached if the handle decomposition of @xmath13 is induced by a @xmath10-morse function which is special in the sense of @xcite .",
