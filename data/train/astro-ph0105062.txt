    "observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy are reaching maturity . the high signal - to - noise multi - frequency data gathered by the balloon - borne  ( de bernardis 2000 ) and  ( hanany 2000 ) experiments set stringent constraints on the shape of the power spectrum in the broad range of angular scales ranging from @xmath11 down to @xmath12 scales ( corresponding to a range in @xmath13-space from @xmath14 up to @xmath15 for  and from @xmath16 to @xmath17 for .",
    "the measurements firmly established the existence of a peak in the power spectrum at @xmath18 , also suggested by the data from earlier + -0.1truecm observations ( ,  miller 1999 and mauskopf 2000 ) .",
    "because no secondary peaks were indisputably seen , there was no unambiguous evidence for an inflation - like scenario where structure formation is driven by passive adiabatic coherent fluctuations ( but see also results concurrent with ours ",
    "netterfield 2001 , and halverson 2001 ) .",
    "the level of power detected beyond the first peak , on subdegree scales , was found to be somewhat lower than that generally expected for inflation - based `` concordance '' models of pre-2000 ( , ostriker &  steinhardt 1995 , krauss &  turner 1995 ) .",
    "although very good fits to the  and  data could be found within the inflationary family of models ( , jaffe 2001 ) , the most favored values of the baryon density were shown to be higher than that inferred from the standard arguments based on the cosmological ( big bang ) nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , though the latter was found to be within the @xmath4% ( @xmath19% ) confidence limits derived from the  ( + ) measurement .",
    "notwithstanding this fact a number of alternatives / extensions to the standard cosmologies were suggested ( , bouchet 2000 , enqvist , kurki - suonio , &  valiviita , 2000 , peebles , seager , &  hu , 2001 ) .",
    "further high resolution data are required to test these models .",
    "a companion , lee ( 2001 ) , presents a new analysis of the  data that extends the measured power spectrum from the previously published range @xmath20 up to @xmath21 . in this",
    "we discuss the cosmological significance of the new result .",
    "this  is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we look for the signature of acoustic oscillations in our power spectrum , the existence of which is predicted by inflation - motivated scenarios . in section 3 , we discuss the cosmological implications of such a feature and derive constraints on some of the cosmological parameters within the family of standard inflationary cosmological models .",

    "1. angular power spectra of the cmb anisotropy recovered from the high resolution map of the  ( lee 2001 ) .",
    "the shaded rectangles show the ranges of the bins used in our likelihood analysis in section  2 , and the @xmath22% confidence limits on the power level in these bins .",
    "the dashed line shows the best - fit model to the previous low resolution results of  ( hanany 2000 ) , the solid line shows the best - fit model for the new data ( lee 2001 ) , and the dotted line shows the best - fit model , fulfilling the bbn constraint , found within the subfamily of all models considered here .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] 0.25 cm    finally , in section 4 we present our conclusions and comment briefly on the viability of non - standard cosmological models in light of the new data .",
    "lee ( 2001 ) set useful constraints on the cmb anisotropy power spectrum up to @xmath24 corresponding to angular scales down to @xmath25 . in terms of the simple @xmath26 statistics assuming a gaussian distribution rather than the approximately offset - lognormal form used in the explicit likelihood calculations . ] , this power , given as @xmath27 in figure  1 , is consistent with a straight horizontal line for @xmath28 yielding a value @xmath29 for 7 degrees of freedom .",
    "however , not only does such a model have no physical justification , but also the data themselves qualitatively suggest the presence of high power at @xmath0 , in excess of the power level at @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "in fact a feature at @xmath32 , a third acoustic peak , is anticipated within a family of generic inflation - based models which are selected to reproduce a first peak at a position @xmath18 as seen in the data .",
    "a statistically significant detection of such a feature would provide important additional support to this family of models .",
    "statistical and systematic errors and correlations between the spectral bands obscure the statistical significance of the results .",
    "we therefore employ a likelihood approach to assess the statistical importance of the feature at @xmath33 in the  power spectrum .",
    "we work within a three - dimensional parameter space .",
    "the initial parameters are the bin powers @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for bins , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , as shown by the shaded regions in figure  1 .",
    "those are chosen to facilitate the search for the feature at @xmath32 .",
    "such a family of spectrum models includes a flat spectrum as a special case , and in the bayesian spirit our analysis seeks to determine how well such a model represents our data .",

    "the contours correspond to @xmath43% confidence levels computed through integration over the regions enclosed within given contours .",

    "0.25 cm    the likelihood for the three - dimensional parameter space is computed assuming the offset lognormal approximation of bond , jaffe &  knox ( 2000 ) to the probability distribution of the bin powers , denoted hereafter @xmath47 .",
    "the likelihood also depends on `` nuisance '' parameters describing the contribution of systematic effects such as the total calibration uncertainty and the beam and pointing error .",
    "we model all of these as fully correlated between bins and gaussian - distributed with a dispersion depending on @xmath13 as given in lee ( 2001 ) .",
    "we marginalize over these parameters by numerical integration .",
    "the question we first ask is whether the power in the two side bins ( @xmath37 and @xmath41 ) is lower than the power in the middle bin centered at @xmath48 and at what confidence level .",
    "for that reason , we introduce two new parameters , @xmath45 and @xmath49 , which are given by the ratio of power between bins @xmath50 . as a third parameter , describing the overall normalization , we choose the bin power amplitude defined above : @xmath51 .",
    "we adopt flat priors in the bin powers and marginalize over the parameter , @xmath51 , leaving only a two dimensional problem , @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is a jacobian .",
    "the results are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the left panel shows the contours of the two dimensional likelihood @xmath54 as a function of the ratios @xmath45 and @xmath49 .",
    "the contours show @xmath55% confidence levels computed assuming flat priors for both parameters .",
    "the shaded area indicates the region of parameter space favoring excess power in the middle bin relative to its neighbors .",
    "models without excess power can not be rejected at a confidence level higher than `` @xmath56 '' ( @xmath57% ) .",
    "it is also apparent , however , that most of the models preferred by the data , have power in the leftmost bin , @xmath37 , that is lower than that in the central bin , @xmath39 .",
    "this point is addressed in the right panel of figure  2 , showing the one - dimensional likelihoods computed through an explicit marginalization over the other parameter .",
    "we find that @xmath58 and hence it is lower than @xmath59 at the confidence level @xmath2% ( , the value of @xmath45 computed in the next section ) , yielding a `` @xmath60 '' detection of the power rise at @xmath44 over the intermediate-@xmath13-range covered by the @xmath37 bin .",
    "this result remains unchanged if we allow for the presence of the ( uncorrelated ) point - source - like component with the amplitude as expected for the @xmath61 ghz band of  even in the most pessimistic cases ( lee 2001 ) .",
    "it may appear that this high confidence level is largely due to the leftmost point of the spectrum ( at @xmath62 ) included in our ( clearly arbitrary ) definition of @xmath37 .",
    "however , excluding that point lowers the confidence level only to @xmath63% . because of the large uncertainties of the lee results beyond @xmath64 the statistical confidence that the power declines beyond the bin @xmath39 is only @xmath65% .",
    "however , the recent cbi result ( padin 2001 ) constrains the power to @xmath66 at @xmath67 providing extra and independent support to the presence of such a decline . the high power level we see in the  data at @xmath0 ,",
    "therefore can not extend far beyond the right edge of the bin @xmath39 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the amplitude of this excess power is restricted by our data to @xmath69 at @xmath4% c.l . including both statistical and systematic errors .    in the usual family of inflation - based models",
    ", one also expects to find a second peak in the region of @xmath70 .",
    "while a single flat band power provides an excellent fit to all the points within bin @xmath37 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 for 4 ( wider bin ) and 3 ( narrower ) degrees of freedom distribution with so few degrees of freedom ; the quotoed numbers are very close to the maxima of those distributions .",
    "] , the presence of a second peak in that region is still comfortably admissible by the data ( figure  1 ) . with our choice of the range of @xmath37",
    ", this bin is expected to be only a factor @xmath73 wider than a typical feature of the power spectrum ( @xmath74 ) of the standard inflationary model .",
    "if such a peak structure is present in that range , @xmath75 means that the bin power at @xmath44 is higher than the level of power in some subsection of the @xmath76 range .",
    "then our analysis above demonstrates that this happens at a confidence level of _ at least _ @xmath4% and that value is our confidence level of detecting a feature in the power spectrum at @xmath44 .",
    "figure  1 demonstrates that an inflationary model with parameters as determined by fitting to the  power spectrum published by hanany ( 2000 ) provides a very good fit over the entire current range of our new data together with the @xmath3-dmr result .",
    "the total @xmath26 is @xmath77 for 41 data points (  plus dmr ) and @xmath78 for the 13 points of  only .",
    "thus , our new data are consistent with the predictions made on the basis of the relatively narrow class of inflation - motivated models assumed in the previous papers .",
    "such a class of models can be seen as a particular subset of the family of models considered in the previous section .",
    "here we consider a seven - dimensional space of parameters .",
    "the parameters include the amplitude of fluctuations at @xmath79 , @xmath80 , the physical baryon density , @xmath81 , the physical density of cold dark matter , @xmath82 , and the cosmological constant , @xmath83 , the total energy density of the universe , @xmath84 , the spectral index of primordial scalar fluctuations , @xmath7 , and the optical depth of reionization , @xmath8 .",
    "we use the following ranges and sampling : @xmath80 is continuous ; @xmath85 = 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.75 , ... , 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.5 ; @xmath81 = 0.00325 , 0.00625 , 0.01 , 0.015 , 0.02 , 0.0225 , ... , 0.04 , 0.045 , 0.05 , 0.075 , 0.1 ; @xmath82 = 0.03 , 0.06 , 0.12 , 0.17 , 0.22 , 0.27 , 0.33 , 0.40 , 0.55 , 0.8 ; @xmath83 = 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , ... , 1.0 ; @xmath7 = 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.75 , 0.8 , 0.85 , 0.875 , ... , 1.2 , 1.25 , ... , 1.5 ; @xmath8 = 0 , 0.025 , 0.05 , 0.075 , 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 .",
    "the justification of the presented choice of the parameter space can be found in balbi 2000 .",
    "models were computed using a version of cmbfast by tegmark , m. , zaldarriaga , m. , &  hamilton , a. , ( 2001 ) , originally by seljak &  zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) .",
    "we compute the likelihood on the grid for models using an offset lognormal approximation ( bond , jaffe , &  knox 2000 ) , including both statistical and systematic errors in a manner analogous to sect .  2 .",
    "we neglect a subdominant pointing uncertainty ( lee 2001 ) . the likelihood for a subset of parameters",
    "is evaluated by an explicit marginalization over all the remaining parameters , using a top - hat prior in parameters used to define our database .",
    "in addition , we impose top - hat priors for the value of the hubble constant @xmath86 , the matter density , @xmath87 and the age of the universe @xmath88  gyr .",
    "we marginalize over the calibration and beam uncertainty in order to account for remaining systematic uncertainties in our results . to provide an extra large - angular - scale constraint we combine our data with the results from the @xmath3-dmr satellite as provided by grski ( 1996 ) .    within the chosen family of inflationary models we put stringent 95% confidence level constraints on the total density , @xmath89 , baryon density , @xmath90 and power spectrum normalization @xmath91 .",
    "our @xmath4% confidence limit on the cold dark matter density is @xmath92 .",
    "however , this result is mostly determined by the priors defining the database parameter range , as discussed in jaffe ( 2001 ) .",
    "we find a strong degeneracy between the optical depth to the last scattering surface , @xmath93 and the primordial power spectrum index , @xmath7 . in this case",
    ", the degeneracy restricts the parameters to a subspace allowing us to derive a combined constraint : @xmath94 ( @xmath4% c.l . ) , for @xmath10 .",
    "we note that we recover the @xmath4% upper limit ( @xmath95 ) on @xmath8 , derived by griffiths , barbosa , &  liddle ( 1999 ) , if we constrain the spectral index to be @xmath96 as was assumed by those authors .",
    "independent of the value of the optical depth , we can put a very firm @xmath97% lower limit on the spectral index , @xmath98 . assuming no reionization ( @xmath99 )",
    ", we can get both lower and upper limits on the spectral index reading @xmath100 . alternatively , fixing @xmath7 at unity gives us a @xmath4% c.l .",
    "upper limit @xmath101 .",
    "the @xmath26 of the best fit model is @xmath102 for all 41 points used in the fittings , and @xmath103 for the 13 points of  only .",
    "the best fit model parameters @xmath104 are characterized by high matter and low vacuum energy content ( see also balbi 2000 ) . however , due to strong degeneracy between @xmath105 and @xmath83 ( , zaldarriaga , spergel &  seljak 1998 ) we can easily find models comfortably fulfilling both + dmr and supernovae constraints ( see figure  3 ) . these data sets constraint jointly the matter and vacuum energy densities to be : @xmath106 ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "the constraint on @xmath107 mentioned above is compatible with the best determination to date of the baryon density based on measurements of primordial deuterium and calculations of standard bbn ( burles , nollett , &  turner , 2001 , tytler 2000 ) , @xmath108 .",
    "the consistency of the data with bbn becomes even more apparent by constraining our parameter estimation on the bbn value of @xmath109 which we approximate by fixing @xmath107 at the grid value nearest to the bbn prediction ( , @xmath110 ) .",
    "the best fit model then has parameters @xmath111 with @xmath112 for the 13  points only .",
    "this very good fit emphasizes the compatibility of our data with other cosmological measurements .",
    "the spectrum of this model is indicated in figure  1 with a dotted line , and it shows that even in that case , the best fit model has a higher third than second peak , if @xmath113 is plotted versus @xmath13 .",

    "we find that the most likely value of that ratio is @xmath115 at the @xmath4% confidence level , consistent with ( though on average higher than ) our result in sect .  2 ( , figure  2 ) .",
    "inflation - based models provide us with an abundance of excellent fits to the extended power spectrum .",
    "these include the best fit models found by the analysis of the first data sets of  and  ( jaffe 2001 , balbi 2000 ) .",
    "constraints on cosmological parameters using dmr and  confirm the near flatness of the universe and , when combined with recent supernova data ( riess 1998 , perlmutter 1998 ) , support the need for the non - zero vacuum energy density . the most likely baryon density indicated by our data",
    "is found to be somewhat higher than the preferred bbn value , yet the latter is within the @xmath4% confidence range of our determination . moreover , there are excellent fits to the data with the baryon fraction at the bbn value .",
    "our results constrain the power at @xmath0 to be @xmath116 on the @xmath4% confidence level .",
    "they also indicate an increase in the power spectrum between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , yielding the ratio of the corresponding bin powers equal to @xmath119 in a general case , or @xmath120 within the considered family of inflationary models .",
    "we have shown that such constraints can be easily fulfilled by these inflationary models .",
    "however , they impose strong requirements on some non - standard models which were found to better accommodate the first results of the  and  experiments .",
    "those models , by design , have an amplitude of power in the intermediate range of @xmath13 below the typical predictions of the standard inflationary models",
    ". however , they also tend to have lower power at the high @xmath13 end and therefore , to match our new constraint at @xmath0 , they would require even higher baryon abundance than the family of the models considered in sect .",
