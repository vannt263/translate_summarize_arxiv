    "the casimir force , arising from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in vacuum , is a striking manifestation of quantum field theory at the mesoscopic scale .",
    "casimir s computation of the force between two parallel metallic plates @xcite gives the classic demonstration of this phenomenon .",
    "following its experimental confirmation in the past decade @xcite , however , the casimir force is now important to the design of microelectromechanical systems @xcite .",
    "potential practical applications have motivated the development of large - scale numerical methods to compute casimir forces for objects of any shape @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the simplest and most commonly used analytic methods for dealing with complex shapes , such as the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) , rely on pairwise summations , limiting their applicability .",
    "recently we have developed a formalism @xcite that relates the casimir interaction among several objects to the scattering of the electromagnetic field from the objects individually .",
    "this method decomposes the path integral representation of the casimir energy @xcite as a log - determinant @xcite in terms of a multiple scattering expansion , as was done for asymptotic separations in ref .",
    "it can also be regarded as a concrete implementation of the perspective emphasized by schwinger @xcite that the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field can be traced back to charge and current fluctuations on the objects .",
    "( for additional perspectives on the scattering formalism , see also references in @xcite . )",
    "this approach allows us to take advantage of the well - developed machinery of scattering theory .",
    "in particular , the availability of exact scattering amplitudes for simple objects , such as spheres and cylinders , has made it possible to compute the casimir force for two spheres @xcite , a sphere and a plate @xcite , multiple cylinders @xcite , and cases with more than two objects @xcite .",
    "this formalism has also been applied and extended in a number of other situations @xcite .    here",
    "we expand on recent work @xcite that showed how to apply these techniques to _ parabolic _ cylinders , another example where the scattering amplitudes can be computed exactly .",
    "the limiting case when the radius of curvature at the tip vanishes , so that the parabolic cylinder becomes a semi - infinite plate ( a `` knife - edge '' ) , provides a particularly interesting application of this approach .",
    "one can also model the knife - edge as the limit of a wedge of zero opening angle @xcite ; the two approaches are rather complementary as the former is most amenable to _ numerical _ computation , while the latter yields approximate _ analytic _ formulae via a multiple reflection expansion ( which is useful for other sharp geometries , such as the cone @xcite ) .",

    "( [ eq : etheta ] ) . because the overall strength of the casimir effect is weaker for a disk than for a sphere , observing casimir forces in this geometry will require greater sensitivities or shorter separation distances than the sphere - plane case .",
    "as the separation gets smaller , however , the dominant contributions arise from higher - frequency fluctuations , and deviations from the perfect conductor limit can become important .",
    "while the effects of finite conductivity could be captured by an extension of our method , the calculation becomes significantly more difficult in this case because the matrix of scattering amplitudes is no longer diagonal .    to estimate the range of important frequencies , we consider @xmath286 and @xmath138 . in this case , the integrand in eq .",
