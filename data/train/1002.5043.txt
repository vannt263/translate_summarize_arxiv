    "the main motivation to study the thermal evolution of neutron stars is that contrasting theoretical predictions with the thermal emission measured from neutron stars ( nss ) has the potential to provide constraints on their inner structure . in the existing literature ,",
    "several detailed cooling calculations have been compared to the few estimates available for the surface temperatures of neutron stars ( see @xcite for a review and references ) .",
    "these calculations are based on the early passive cooling , which is at first neutrino - dominated . on the contrary",
    ", we focused our study on the late thermal evolution , where the cooling is driven by photon emission at ages greater than @xmath0yr .",
    "several mechanisms can keep nss hot beyond the standard cooling timescale @xmath1yr , among them _",
    "rotochemical heating_. the latter",
    "was first proposed in @xcite and then improved in @xcite by considering the internal structure of non - superfluid neutron stars via realistic equations of state ( eoss ) in the framework of general relativity .",
    "it works as follows .",
    "the reduction of the centrifugal force makes the ns contract .",
    "this perturbs each fluid element , raising the local pressure and originating deviations from beta equilibrium , which are quantified by the chemical imbalances @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , are neutrons and protons respectively , and @xmath5 stands for leptons ( electrons and muons ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the neutrino reactions tend to restore the beta equilibrium , being more efficient as @xmath6 grows . in this sense , the evolution equations for the chemical imbalances have the following form : @xmath7 where the terms @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are constants that depend on the stellar structure , and @xmath13 is the product of the angular velocity and its time derivative ( proportional to the spin - down power ) .",
    "additionally , we have introduced the net reaction rate integrated over the core , defined as @xmath14 .",
    "the evolution of the temperature of the isothermal interior , redshifted to a distant observer , @xmath15 , is given by the thermal balance equation @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total heat capacity of the star , @xmath18 is the total power emitted as neutrinos due to urca reactions , and @xmath19 is the power released as thermal photons .",
    "the heating term @xmath20 produced by each urca - type reaction is defined as @xmath21 .",
    "the most relevant feature of these equations is that , eventually , the system reaches a quasi - steady state where the rate at which spin - down modifies the equilibrium concentrations is the same at which neutrino reactions restore the equilibrium ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this implies a conversion of rotational energy into thermal energy and an enhanced neutrino emission originated by a departure from the beta equilibrium .",
    "thus , this mechanism can keep old millisecond pulsars ( msps ) warm , at temperatures @xmath22 k.      cooling curves usually consider the effects of nucleon superfluidity on the thermal evolution of nss .",
    "superfluidity is produced by cooper pairing of baryons due to the attractive component of their strong interaction , and it is present only when the temperature @xmath23 of the matter falls below a critical temperature @xmath24 . however",
    ", the physics of these interactions is rather uncertain and very model - dependent , and so is the critical temperature obtained from theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an important microscopic effect is that the onset of superfluidity leads to the appearance of a gap @xmath25 in the spectrum of excitations around the fermi surface .",
    "this gap in the spectrum considerably reduces the neutrino reactions and the specific heat involving superfluid species ( neutrons and protons in the core ) @xcite , and therefore , changes the evolution of rotochemical heating .",
    ", the surface temperature @xmath26 and the chemical imbalances @xmath27 , @xmath28 for a star with the parameters fixed to the millisecond pulsar j0437 - 4715 , i.e. a mass of @xmath29 @xcite , built with the a18 + @xmath30 + uix * eos , and a magnetic field @xmath31 g. the initial conditions are @xmath32 k , null chemical imbalances , and an initial period of @xmath33 ms .",
    "the error bar is the @xmath34 confidence level for the surface temperature measured for the millisecond pulsar j0437 - 4715 @xcite at its current spin - down parameters . _",
    "upper panel : _ nonsuperfluid case ( null energy gaps ) .",
    "_ lower panel : _ superfluidity of neutrons with @xmath35 mev ( dashed line).,width=453,height=264 ]",
    "we consider models in which modified urca reactions are the main neutrino emission mechanism : @xmath36 where the subscripts @xmath37 and @xmath38 stand for the initial and final state of the spectator nucleon @xmath39 .    as in @xcite",
    ", we compute the net reaction rate @xmath40 and the neutrino emissivity for these reactions numerically , considering the chemical imbalances @xmath6 , the energy gaps @xmath25 in the energy spectra of the nucleons , and the temperature as free parameters ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "we find that at low temperatures , i.e. @xmath41 , which is the regime of interest in rotochemical heating ( see the upper panel of figure 1 ) , these reactions are almost completely blocked due to the energy gap when @xmath42 .",
    "however , several reactions are opened when @xmath43 .",
    "this is the most important effect of cooper pairing in rotochemical heating since the quasi - steady state will be reached when the restoring mechanism given by the neutrino reactions becomes sufficiently important to conterbalance the effect of the spin - down forcing mechanism .",
    "1 shows that , for the superfluid case , the reactions are blocked until the chemical imbalances overcome the value of the energy gap of the neutrons @xmath44 , as argued above .",
    "these chemical imbalances are higher than those achieved in the non - superfluid case .",
    "this effect lengthens the timescale at which the system reaches the quasi - steady state , and implies that , in the presence of superfluidity , the chemical energy is larger and dissipated later to reheat the star .",
    "this makes it possible to fit the observation of the msp j0437 - 4715 @xcite , unlike the non - superfluid case . finally , for several",
    "eos in which modified urca reactions are the dominant neutrino emission mechanism , this observation constrains the energy gaps to lie in the range @xmath45<\\mbox{min}\\left (   \\delta_n+3\\delta_p,3\\delta_n+\\delta_p \\right)<0.45 [ \\mbox{mev}]$ ] @xcite ."
