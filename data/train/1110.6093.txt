    "prediction of binding energy is a very important task in nuclear physics .",
    "for example , binding energy of the nuclear ground state is one of the most important inputs in the study of astrophysical reactions .",
    "experimental mass measurements are difficult to make in nuclei far from the stability valley .",
    "thus , one has to take recourse to theoretical predictions . in a recent paper@xcite ( hereafter called ref .",
    "i ) a new phenomenological formula for ground state binding energies has been introduced . in the present work ,",
    "we explore a few of the implications of the new formula and also compare our results with the predictions from some other formulas .",
    "the area we concentrate on in the present work is related to the study of proton dripline . as pointed out in ref .",
    "i , the root men square ( r.m.s . ) error in the ground state binding energies is 0.376 mev for 2140 nuclei . near the stability valley , single nucleon separation energy ( proton or neutron ) is of the order of 8 mev .",
    "thus , a small error in binding energy does not influence the results of processes which involve nuclei near this valley .",
    "however , the separation energies of protons and neutrons near the corresponding driplines are actually very small , sometimes comparable to the errors in theoretical predictions .",
    "thus , it should be interesting to study the performance of the formula from ref .",
    "i in predicting the location of the proton dripline .",
    "we also investigate the effect of the mass formula on the rapid proton ( @xmath2 ) process nucleosynthesis beyond @xmath0ni .",
    "this process goes along the @xmath3 line and is dependent on the binding energy of protons near the proton dripline .",
    "for details of the mass formula , we refer the readers to ref i where it was developed .",
    "the present section is divided into two parts . in the first part",
    ", we calculate the location of the proton dripline according to the present formula and compare with experimental observations and a few other predictions . in the second part , we study the effect of the present mass formula in astrophysical @xmath2-process in mass 60 - 80 region .",
    "the proton dripline for a particular neutron number is defined to be the nucleus beyond which the proton separation energy becomes zero or negative . obviously ,",
    "because of the pairing effect , the @xmath4 of the proton dripline nucleus is expected to be even .",
    "studying the nucleon dripline is one of the major activities in nuclear physics .",
    "however , it has been possible to reach the neutron dripline in only very light nuclei .",
    "proton dripline , on the other hand , is more accessible to experiments .",
    "we note that the location of the proton dripline is known for a number of neutron numbers , particularly in mass 100 - 220 region .",
    "nuclei with protons in positive energy continuum show proton radioactivity where protons tunnel through the coulomb barrier .",
    "a number of such nuclei are known in mass 100 - 200 region .",
    ".location of proton dripline .",
    "the columns stand for the following : exp .",
    "- experimental , ref .",
    "i - present calculation , frdm - finite range droplet model and d - z - duflo - zuker formula . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the known mass values of nuclei enable us to calculate the location of the proton dripline . in the first two columns of table i , we summarize our knowledge for the neutron numbers for which the experimental proton dripline is exactly known . the mass table of audi .@xcite and the more recent references on binding energy measurements included in ref .",
    "i have been used to determine the experimental proton dripline .",
    "we calculate the location of the proton dripline from the new binding energy formula of ref .",
    "i and present it in table i. the results of the finite range droplet model ( frdm)@xcite and the duflo - zuker ( d - z ) mass formula@xcite are also presented .",
    "we see that the present method can accurately predict the location of the proton dripline in most of the cases and is actually better than frdm .",
    "the duflo - zuker formula is even better in this respect .",
    "we would like to point out that the conclusions of different experiments on the binding energy of @xmath5as do not agree .",
    "schury .@xcite have concluded that @xmath5as has a negative proton separation energy while a recent measurement@xcite has raised the possibility of it being stable with respect to proton emission .",
    "the implication of this uncertainty in proton separation energy of @xmath5as has been discussed in the next subsection in more detail .    even in the few cases where the present approach fails to accurately locate the dripline ,",
    "the next even @xmath4 nuclei is indicated .",
    "one needs to remember that the formula has an r.m.s .",
    "error of 376 kev .",
    "thus , if the predicted binding energy of the last proton in an odd @xmath4 nucleus is very small , it is possible that the nucleus is actually beyond the proton dripline .",
    "conversely , prediction of a very small negative value of last proton separation energy can not guarantee that the dripline does not actually lie beyond .",
    "for example , in @xmath6 and @xmath7 nuclei , the calculated binding energy of the last proton in @xmath8lu are only 0.047 mev and 0.012 mev , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculated separation energy of the last proton in @xmath9tl ( @xmath10 ) is -0.030 mev only .",
    "we want to look at the effect of the new mass formula on nucleosynthesis . particularly , in view of the success of the formula to predict the proton dripline , it should be interesting to see the effect of the proton separation energy predicted by the present formula on the @xmath2-process . in this process , which takes place in hot explosive proton - rich environment such as x - ray bursts ,",
    "a nucleus may capture high energy protons .",
    "however , this process has to compete with its inverse , i.e. photodisintegration by emitting a proton at high temperature ( ( @xmath11 ) reaction ) . a negative or a small positive value of proton separation energy implies that the inverse reaction dominates and the @xmath2-process stalls at that point , the so - called waiting point .",
    "two proton capture may lead to the nucleosynthesis bridging the waiting point and proceed beyond .",
    "more details of the process is available in standard text books ( for example the book by illiadis@xcite ) .",
    "the stellar decay constant ( @xmath12 ) for photodisintegration , _",
    "i.e. _ ( @xmath11 ) reaction , is related to the proton capture rate by the reciprocity theorem in the following numerical form@xcite @xmath13 for the reaction @xmath14 and is expressed in @xmath15 when the forward reaction rate , given by @xmath16 , is expressed in @xmath17 .",
    "the temperature @xmath18 is expressed in gk ( @xmath19k ) and @xmath20 is the ground state q - value of the forward reaction expressed in mev . the normalized partition functions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , may be obtained from rauscher .@xcite . for protons , we have @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the photodisintegration rate depends exponentially on the proton separation energy .",
    "this quantity , thus , plays a very important role in the possibility of @xmath2-process proceeding beyond the waiting point .",
    "there are significant disagreements in the predictions of proton separation energy of different mass formulas , and even between different measurements . in some other cases ,",
    "experimental measurements may exist but the the error in measurement is too large to draw any meaningful conclusion . as an example , we look at an example of the waiting point nucleus , @xmath25ge .",
    "the measured and estimated q - values of the proton capture reaction differ over a large range .",
    "schury .@xcite have measured the q - value to be @xmath26 mev .",
    "a recent measurement@xcite has found the proton separation energy of @xmath5as to be 0.401(530 ) mev , _",
    "i.e. _ the nucleus may even be bound .",
    "the duflo - zuker formula@xcite suggests the value to be -0.407 mev .",
    "the frdm calculation of mller .@xcite predicts the value as 0.13 mev .",
    "the mass table@xcite gives the q - value as -0.08 mev .",
    "a very recent measurement@xcite has given a value of -0.090(0.085 ) mev .",
    "the new mass formula suggests a value -0.116 mev , which is very close to the last estimation . in such cases , it becomes imperative to look at the implications of different mass formulas .",
    "we present the bridging this particular waiting point in some detail .    for the calculation of proton capture process",
    ", a small network has been designed which includes the following processes .",
    "the waiting point nucleus , which acts as a seed , may capture a proton .",
    "the resulting nucleus @xmath5as may either capture another proton to produce @xmath27se or undergo photodisintegration emitting a proton to go back to the seed nucleus .",
    "the nucleus @xmath27se may also undergo photodisintegration .",
    "in addition , all the three nuclei mentioned above may undergo @xmath28-decay .",
    "we calculate the change in half life of @xmath25ge in an explosive astrophysical environment assuming the density to be @xmath29gm/@xmath30 and the proton fraction to be 0.7 .",
    "a microscopic optical potential has been obtained by folding the ddm3y potential@xcite with nuclear densities obtained in relativistic mean field model with the lagrangian density fsu gold@xcite .",
    "the calculation follows our earlier works@xcite where more details are available .",
    "the measured half life values for @xmath28-decay have been taken from the compilation by audi .@xcite except in the case of the case of @xmath5as .",
    "for this nucleus , a value of 0.128 seconds from an experimental measurement@xcite has been assumed .",
    "if measured values are not available , we have adopted the values from the work by mller .@xcite    -0.5 cm    the results of the calculation on effective half life of @xmath25ge as a function of temperature are presented for different mass estimates in fig .",
    "the different values have been indicated as follows : schury measurement by schury .@xcite , d - z duflo - zuker formula@xcite , a - w mass table of audi .@xcite , pres. present work and frdm frdm results of mller .@xcite . at low temperature proton capture rate",
    "is small and @xmath28-decay predominates . at high temperature photodisintegration",
    "dominates over capture .",
    "thus the predominant decay mode is again @xmath28-decay . in between",
    "there is a temperature window where two proton capture leads to @xmath27se . from the figure ,",
    "it is clear that the rate of two proton capture is sensitively dependent on the masses used in the calculation .",
    "the q - values predicted by the duflo - zuker formula leads to a minimum lifetime of nearly 30 seconds .",
    "the values predicted by the present mass formula and that by audi .@xcite decrease the lifetime by more than one order of magnitude . if @xmath5as is bound as suggested by some works@xcite , the rate of the inverse process is small .",
    "in such a situation , two proton capture dominates and the waiting point is easily bridged .    as is evident from the above discussion , the bridging of waiting points , and hence the @xmath2-process abundance crucially depends on the proton separation energy .",
    "however , this is sometimes poorly known on the @xmath3 nucleus as the process goes along the proton dripline where information is meager .",
    "the degree of bridging of the waiting point has significant effect on the path that the @xmath2-nucleosynthesis takes in explosive proton - rich environments such as x - ray bursters .",
    "typical x - ray burst has a time scale of 10 - 100 seconds . in case",
    "a significant fraction of the population does not undergo two proton capture reaction , it traverses along a path of more stable isotopes and nucleosynthesis is delayed .",
    "thus , it may not be possible for an x - ray burst to populate nuclei with significant mass in case a particular waiting point stalls the process substantially .",
