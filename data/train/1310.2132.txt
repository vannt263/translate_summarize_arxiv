    "<S> we report a versatile and cost - effective way of controlling the unsaturated loss , modulation depth and saturation fluence of graphene - based saturable absorbers ( gsas ) , by changing the thickness of a spacer between slg and a high - reflection mirror . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to modulate the electric field intensity enhancement at the gsa from 0 up to 400% , due to the interference of incident and reflected light at the mirror . </S>",
    "<S> the unsaturated loss of the slg - mirror - assembly can be reduced to@xmath00 . </S>",
    "<S> we use this to mode - lock a vecsel from 935 to 981 nm . </S>",
    "<S> this approach can be applied to integrate slg into various optical components , such as output coupler mirrors , dispersive mirrors , dielectric coatings on gain materials . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , it can also be used to increase absorption ( up to 10% ) in various graphene based photonics and optoelectronics devices , such as photodetectors .    </S>",
    "<S> ultrafast mode - locked lasers play an increasingly important role in numerous applications , ranging from optical communications@xcite to medical diagnostics@xcite and industrial material processing@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , ultrafast vertical - external - cavity surface - emitting lasers ( vecsels ) , also referred to as semiconductor disk lasers ( sdls)@xcite or optically pumped semiconductor lasers ( opsls)@xcite , are excellent pulsed sources for various applications , such as multi - photon microscopy@xcite , optical data communications@xcite , supercontinuum generation@xcite and ultra - compact stabilized frequency combs @xcite . in such lasers , light propagates </S>",
    "<S> perpendicular to the semiconductor gain layers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to vertical - cavity surface - emitting lasers ( vcsels)@xcite , a vecsel consists of an external cavity , formed by high - reflection mirrors , and an output coupler , with typical cavity lengths of a few mm up to tens cm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gain chip generally contains a highly reflective bottom section to reflect the laser and pump light , an active semiconductor gain section in the middle , and an anti - reflective top layer@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> vecsels combine the advantages of semiconductor laser technology , such as compact footprint ( down to@xmath03 mm cavity length@xcite ) , with the benefits of diode pumped solid - state lasers , such as low timing jitter@xcite , excellent beam quality@xcite , high average@xcite and peak power@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> currently , semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors ( sesams)@xcite are used for passive mode - locking , since they offer advantages such as an excellent ratio of saturable to non - saturable losses ( e.g.50:1@xcite ) and a high damage threshold ( @xmath10.21j/@xmath2)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , sesams , epitaxially grown on lattice - matched semiconductor substrates@xcite , only offer a limited operation bandwidth ( to date , the broadest tuning range of vecsels mode - locked with sesams is 13.7nm@xcite ) and have a fast recovery time ranging from several hundreds fs@xcite to tens ps@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> graphene , on the other hand , is the widest bandwidth material@xcite , due to the gapless linear dispersion of the dirac electrons , and has ultrafast recovery dynamics ( @xmath3100fs)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , large - area ( compared to a typical laser spot ) , high quality , single layer graphene ( slg ) can be easily grown@xcite and integrated in a variety of lasers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> graphene has emerged as a promising saturable absorber ( sa ) for ultrafast pulse generation because of its simple , low - cost fabrication and assembly@xcite , ultrafast carrier lifetime@xcite and broadband absorption@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the unsaturated loss ( i.e. the loss of a device at low incident power ) of a typical intracavity transmission device based on single layer graphene ( slg ) is typically @xmath02@xmath42.3% ( the factor 2 accounting for the double - pass per round - trip ) for the most common linear cavities@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while this allows to use slg as sa ( gsa ) to mode - lock a variety of lasers , such as fiber@xcite , solid - state@xcite and waveguide@xcite , it poses serious limitations for vecsels@xcite . these typically require a sa mirror with losses@xmath33%@xcite because the small - signal gain ( i.e. the optical gain for a low - intensity signal where no saturation occurs during amplification ) of vecsels suitable for mode - locking is@xmath03 to 5%@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , inserting a slg - based device ( e.g. slg on a quartz substrate@xcite ) inhibits lasing , due to the high loss induced by the@xmath04.6% absorption incurred in the double - pass per cavity round - trip .            to realize vecsel mode - locking with graphene it is thus crucial to reduce the losses per cavity roundtrip to@xmath33% ( i.e.@xmath31.5% for single pass ) while maintaining high ( in the range of 0.5 - 2%@xcite ) modulation depth ( i.e. the maximum absorption change induced by changing the intensity of the incident light ) over a spectral range wide enough to have a sufficient modulation for the self - starting passive mode - locking of broadband vecsels . </S>",
    "<S> different methods can be used to reduce the absorption in graphene : doping@xcite or gating@xcite can decrease the absorption over a broad spectral range by pauli blocking according to@xcite : @xmath5 $ ] , where t is the temperature and @xmath6 is the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> so , e.g. , to have 1.5% absorption at@xmath0960 nm ( the working wavelength of our laser ) one would need to stably shift the fermi level by@xmath0630mev . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is challenging to precisely control this high doping level . </S>",
    "<S> gating usually needs extra electrical contacts and drivers , which increase the complexity of the system .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we change the absorption by controlling the electric field intensity in slg on a high - reflection mirror . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting slg - based saturable absorber mirrors ( gsams ) have an unsaturated loss adjustable from 0 up to 10% and modulation depth up to 5% . </S>",
    "<S> these enable us to mode - lock a vecsel , at the same time exploiting the broadband properties of graphene , thus allowing the widest wavelength - tuning thus far reported in vecsels .        </S>",
    "<S> the gsam absorption is controlled as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the incoming and reflected waves off a mirror , form a standing wave beyond the mirror surface . </S>",
    "<S> the field intensity enhancement @xmath7 at a distance @xmath8 from the mirror can be written as@xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the reflected and incident wave electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> for an anti - resonant high - reflection ( @xmath12 ) mirror with no additional coating , we get ( see methods ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the wavelength , @xmath15 is the refractive index of air . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the slg absorption can be tuned by changing the optical distance between slg and the mirror surface . the slg absorption ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> becomes @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the absorption of a suspended and undoped slg@xcite , and @xmath18 is the field intensity enhancement at the absorber position . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , placing a slg directly onto the mirror surface ( @xmath19 nm ) we get @xmath20 , thus expect no absorption , due to destructive interference between incoming and reflected waves . </S>",
    "<S> if slg is placed at a @xmath21 distance , where there is a peak of the standing wave , we have @xmath22 , @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> thus its absorption will increase to 400% ( i.e. 4@xmath24 ) due to constructive interference .            to verify this principle </S>",
    "<S> , we fabricate four gsams with different optical distances by coating the mirror with : 0 , @xmath14/12 sio@xmath25 , @xmath14/8 sio@xmath25 and @xmath14/4 sio@xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we use anti - resonant distributed bragg reflectors ( dbrs)@xcite as high - reflection mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> these typically consist of a stack of multiple layers with alternating high and low refractive index@xcite , each with an optical thickness of a quarter of the design wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the partial reflections at the layer interfaces can interfere constructively resulting in high reflection ( @xmath12@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> our dbrs consist of 30 layer pairs of alas and gaas ( as described in methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> they are designed to give a node of the standing wave at the surface of the top layer ( anti - resonance ) , with reflectivity>99.997% at 960 nm ( our vecsels wavelength ) . </S>",
    "<S> figs.[figure1](a - d ) plot schematics of the dbr . </S>",
    "<S> the dbrs are then coated by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited sio@xmath25 with different thickness ( @xmath26 ) : 0 , @xmath14/12 , @xmath14/8 and @xmath14/4 , i.e 0 , 55 , 83 , 165 nm . the field intensity enhancement @xmath27 at the top surfaces of these devices </S>",
    "<S> can be calculated as ( see methods ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath26 are the refractive index and the thickness of the sio@xmath25 spacers at the operation wavelength @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a field intensity enhancement @xmath18 of 0 , 0.5 , 1.3 and 4 respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> slg is then grown by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd)@xcite and transferred on top of the dbrs with sio@xmath25-coating as described in methods . the quality of graphene before and after transfer is monitored by raman spectroscopy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the raman spectrum before transfer is shown in fig.[figure2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is measured at 457 nm excitation , since this wavelength suppresses the cu luminescence , which would result in a non - flat background@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum shows a very small i(d)/i(g)@xmath00.004 , indicating negligible defects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d peak is a single sharp lorentzian with full width at half maximum , fwhm(2d)@xmath035@xmath30 , a signature of slg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> representative raman spectra of the transferred graphene on the 0 , @xmath14/4 sio@xmath31 , @xmath14/8 sio@xmath31 , @xmath14/12 sio@xmath31 devices are shown in fig.[figure2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> after transfer , the 2d peak is still a single sharp lorentzian with fwhm(2d)@xmath035@xmath30 , confirming that slg has indeed been successfully transferred , and i(d)/i(g)@xmath00.005 , showing that negligible additional defects are induced by the transfer process . in order to estimate the doping level of the transferred films , an analysis of more than 10 measurements </S>",
    "<S> is carried out for 514 nm excitation . </S>",
    "<S> we use this wavelength as most previous literature and correlations were derived at 514nm@xcite . for the film transferred on the @xmath14/8 sio@xmath31 sample , the average g peak position , pos(g ) , and fwhm(g ) , are 1591.8@xmath30 and 14.6@xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the average pos(2d ) is 2693@xmath30 , and the 2d to g intensity and area ratios i(2d)/i(g ) ; </S>",
    "<S> a(2d)/a(g ) , are 2.7 and 6.3 . this indicates a p - doping@xmath00.5@xmath410@xmath32@xmath33 , corresponding to a fermi level shift@xmath0300mev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for the @xmath14/4- and @xmath14/12-mirrors we get a p - doping@xmath34@xmath33 , corresponding to a fermi level shift<400mev . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also transferred slg on quartz , fig.[figure2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the band at@xmath00.270@xmath35 m is a signature of the van hove singularity in the graphene density of states@xcite , while those at@xmath01.4 , 2.2@xmath35 m are due to the quartz substrate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption at 960 nm ( our operation wavelength ) is@xmath36 , but it decreases to@xmath0 1% at 2@xmath35 m due to doping@xcite . by fitting to the measured transmittance ( @xmath37 ) , we get @xmath38mev , consistent with the raman estimates . </S>",
    "<S> however , such doping level is not enough to significantly affect the absorption at 960 nm , which is measured to be@xmath36 ( fig.[figure2](b ) ) , as for intrinsic slg@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the linear unsaturated absorption of our four gsams at 960 nm , measured with a high - precision ( 0.05% resolution ) reflectivity setup@xcite is plotted in fig.[figure1](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> this also plots the calculated absorption from eq.[equationfe_abs ] . </S>",
    "<S> our devices have a=0.25% , 1.6% , 3.2% and 10% at 960 nm respectively , in agreement with calculations . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[figure1](f ) plots the field intensity enhancement calculated from eq.[equationfe_abs ] as a function of wavelength , compared to experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this further validates the results . </S>",
    "<S> note that the absorption is not flat as that of graphene on quartz ( fig.[figure2](b ) ) , because @xmath27 depends on wavelength ( fig.[figure1](f ) ) according to eq.[equationfe_abs ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we also characterize the gsams reflectivity as a function of input light fluence ( j/@xmath39 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fluence - dependent reflectivity measurements ( non - linear reflectivity ) show an increase in reflectivity with fluence as expected from a sa , fig.[figure2](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum changes in reflectivity for the @xmath14/12 , @xmath14/8 and @xmath14/4 devices are 0.2%,0.9% and 2% , respectively . the measurement for the @xmath14/4 sio@xmath25 device ( _ i.e. _ the sample with @xmath27=4 at the graphene position ) is shown in fig.[figure2](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> for a fast sa ( i.e. where the absorber recovery time is faster than the probe pulse duration ) , the reflectivity can be written as@xcite : @xmath40+r_{\\text{ns}},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the unsaturated reflectivity , @xmath42 the non - saturable reflectivity , @xmath43 the saturation fluence . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a saturation fluence @xmath44100@xmath35j/@xmath2 ( corresponding to a peak intensity @xmath451.0gw/@xmath2 ) , as extracted by fitting eq.[equation4 ] to the data in fig.[figure2](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated modulation depth is@xmath46 , 2.7 times larger than that reported for slg on quartz@xcite . when a higher input fluence ( > 120@xmath35j/@xmath2 ( 4gw/@xmath2 ) ) is used , the gsam reflectivity starts to increase permanently , indicating degradation . from eq.[equation4 ] , @xmath43 of the @xmath14/8 sample is estimated as@xmath0200@xmath35j/@xmath2 , higher than the @xmath14/4 sample , because the smaller field intensity enhancement at the absorber makes the device saturate at a higher fluence . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> degradation also starts at higher fluence ( > 300@xmath35j/@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in slg , the non - equilibrium ( non - thermal ) distribution of electrons in conduction band and holes in valence band created by an ultrafast pulse relaxes , eventually reaching thermal equilibrium with the lattice , due to various processes@xcite , including carrier - carrier and carrier - phonon scattering , as well as radiative electron - hole recombination ( non - linear photoluminescence@xcite ) . in the sub - ps time - frame </S>",
