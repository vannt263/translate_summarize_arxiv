    "it has been known since the late 1960s that both the continuum ( e.g. , fitch , pacholczyk , & weymann 1967 ) and broad emission lines ( e.g. , andrillat & souffrin 1968 ) in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) vary in flux with time . in the 1980s",
    ", spectroscopic monitoring programs showed that the continuum and emission - line variations are closely coupled , confirming that the emission - line regions are powered predominantly by photoionization by the central source .",
    "however , the typical emission - line response times were found to be surprisingly short compared to the light - travel times expected by most photoionization equilibrium models ( e.g. , peterson et al .",
    "attempts were made to determine light - travel times for the broad - line region ( blr ) by cross - correlation of continuum and emission - line fluxes ( e.g. , gaskell & sparke 1986 ) , but the analyses were plagued by sparsely sampled light curves and relatively large uncertainties in the measured fluxes ( e.g. , gaskell & peterson 1987 ; edelson & krolik 1988 ) . in spite of the difficulties , the potential for extracting physical information about the central regions of agns from variability was generally regarded to be enormous ( see peterson 1988 for a review of the early monitoring programs and their implications ) : in principle , it is possible to constrain significantly the structure and kinematics of the blr by determining the emission - line response to continuum variations as a function of wavelength , since the broad - lines are well - resolved in radial velocity even at low ( @xmath2 ) resolution .",
    "this process is known as `` reverberation mapping '' ( blandford & mckee 1982 ) .",
    "late in the 1980s , it became possible to obtain the quality and quantity of data necessary to determine emission - line response times . in the ultraviolet , large amounts of _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "time were devoted to agn variability projects ( e.g. , clavel et al .",
    "1991 ) . in the optical ,",
    "ccds became widely available on even moderate - size ( @xmath3-m ) and small - size ( @xmath4-m ) ground - based telescope , making it possible to obtain high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath5 ) spectra of high photometric accuracy with relative ease .",
    "the problem of poor time sampling was obviated by cooperation between observers , either by using many telescopes ( e.g. , peterson et al .",
    "1991 ) or by a group using a single facility ( e.g. , maoz et al .  1990 ,",
    "robinson 1994 ) .",
    "progress in reverberation mapping through 1992 is reviewed by peterson ( 1993 ) , and a more recent review is given by netzer & peterson ( 1997 ) .    in 1988 , we began a long series of approximately weekly spectroscopic monitoring of nearby bright seyfert galaxies with a ccd spectrograph on the 1.8-m perkins telescope at lowell observatory .",
    "we present here the first analysis of most of these data .",
    "the scientific goals of the program have been :    1 .   to acquire optical continuum and emission - line light curves of sufficient sampling and quality to determine accurately the emission - line response times , or `` lags '' for a number of agns .",
    "2 .   to investigate agn continuum behavior over a long temporal baseline .",
    "3 .   to investigate the nature of broad emission - line _ profile _  variability , and see what this reveals about the kinematics of the broad - line region .",
    "4 .   to investigate the possibility of structural changes in the blr on time scales of years ( which corresponds to the dynamical time for the blr ) .    some of the results of this program have been reported elsewhere in the literature , but this is the first comprehensive presentation of the data obtained since 1988 .    in this paper , we present the light curves for the optical continuum and the broad  emission lines in nine seyfert galaxies . for most of these objects ,",
    "we are able to determine accurately the emission - line lags , and for these objects we can estimate the mass of the central black hole . in future papers",
    ", we will discuss other issues , such as line - profile variations .",
    "in  2 we describe the observations and data reduction that led to this homogeneous data base of spectra .",
    "analysis of the light curves is described in  3 , and we summarize our results in  , 4 .",
    "the galaxies observed in this monitoring program were non - rigorously selected according to a number of simple criteria .",
    "these are among the brightest seyfert 1 galaxies observable from the northern hemisphere .",
    "they are distributed in fairly evenly right ascension since the monitoring program was scheduled approximately one night per week throughout the entire year , and sources were observed whenever they were accessible . many of these galaxies were found to have variable emission lines based on earlier observations ( e.g. , peterson , crenshaw , & meyers 1985 , and references therein ) with the ohio state image dissector scanner ( byard et al .",
    "some preference was given to galaxies in which the the  equivalent width had been observed to change , which was taken to be a possible indication that light travel - time effects might be important in these sources .",
    "some consideration was also given to ensuring that a wide variety of broad - line profile types was represented in the sample .",
    "in this paper , we report on results for the nine seyfert galaxies listed in table 1 .",
    "the common source name is given in column ( 1 ) , and the epoch 1950 right ascension and declination appear in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , respectively .",
    "the redshift @xmath6 is given in column ( 4 ) , and the galactic @xmath7-band extinction @xmath8 , from the ned database , is shown in column ( 5 ) .",
    "column ( 6 ) gives the specific luminosity at about 5100  in the rest frame of each galaxy , corrected for galactic extinction , based on the average fluxes given later in this paper ( table 5 ) .",
    "in addition to the sources listed in table  1 , a number of other seyfert galaxies were monitored spectroscopically as part of this program , often in coordination with other observers ( particularly the international agn watch , alloin et al .",
    "1994 ) and often at multiple wavelengths .",
    "the well - studied source ngc 5548 has been one of our primary targets ( peterson et al .",
    "1991 , 1992 , 1994 , korista et al .",
    "1995 ) , and recent observations are being prepared for publication . this program has also included observations of ngc 3783 ( stirpe et al .",
    "1994 ) , ngc 4151 ( kaspi et al .",
    "1996a ) , ngc 7469 ( collier et al .  1998 ) , and the broad - line radio galaxy 3c 390.3 ( dietrich et al .",
    "1998 ) , as well as mrk 279 and ngc 4051 ( to be published elsewhere ) .",
    "we have published preliminary results on two sources included here , mrk 590 ( peterson et al .",
    "1993 ) and mrk 335 ( kassebaum et al .",
    "1997 ) ; the results presented here include revisions of the data in these earlier papers , superseding the previous results .",
    "our observations of another of these sources , mrk 509 , were included in a larger compilation ( carone et al .",
    "1996 ) , and here we present recent observations obtained since that program was completed .",
    "our analysis incorporates data from carone et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as well .",
    "our sample does not include certain well - known nearby very low - luminosity agns ; even at the time this program was initiated ( 1988 ) , existing data suggested that weekly observations would seriously undersample the variations in these objects .",
    "some of these lower - luminosity objects were monitored by the lag consortium ( see robinson 1994 for a compilation ) . except for an intensive 10-day program in 1993 ( kaspi et al .",
    "1996a ) , the best - known seyfert 1 , ngc 4151 , has not been included as a priority target for this very reason .",
    "we have also deliberately avoided higher luminosity sources for two reasons :    1 .   at the time this program was started , almost nothing was known about continuum and emission - line variability in high - luminosity non - blazar agns .",
    "the scientific focus of this program has been use of emission - line variability to probe the inner structure of agns rather than study of variability _ per se_.",
    "we therefore decided to restrict our program to sources that we felt had the best chance of yielding useful variability data .",
    "higher - luminosity sources tend to be at large redshifts .",
    "inclusion of high - redshift sources in our program results in observations inefficiencies as the spectrograph grating angle has to be reset and the instrument recalibrated for higher - redshift sources .",
    "this was deemed to be undesirable .",
    "we did briefly explore the possibility of including somewhat higher - luminosity sources , and in early 1991 , we observed gq comae approximately once per week for about three months .",
    "no continuum or emission line variations were detected at that time . since then , however , it has been demonstrated that higher - luminosity agns do indeed undergo continuum and emission - line variations similar to those seen in the seyfert galaxies discussed here ( e.g. , kaspi et al .",
    "1996b ) .",
    "the reader is thus cautioned that the sources in table  1 do not represent a statistical sample on any basis .",
    "they were all selected for this program because we believed that the continuum and emission - line variability time scales were appropriate for one - week sampling and because they were readily accessible in terms of position , redshift , and brightness .",
    "the sources in table  1 span a mere factor of four in luminosity , while the agn phenomenon extends over some 15 magnitudes .",
    "all the observations were made with the ohio state university ccd spectrograph on the 1.8-m perkins telescope of the ohio wesleyan and ohio state universities at lowell observatory near flagstaff , arizona .",
    "observations were scheduled approximately once per week , year round , interrupted only by bad weather and occasional equipment failures .",
    "each galaxy was observed whenever it was accessible , although special priority was assigned to ngc 5548 ( discussed elsewhere ) , mrk 335 , mrk 590 , akn 120 , mrk 79 , and mrk 509 .",
    "three of the sources discussed here , mrk 110 , mrk 704 , and mrk 817 , were added to the program relatively late , and mrk 704 and 3c 120 were lower - priority sources , so there are relatively fewer observations of these galaxies .",
    "the entrance slit of the spectrograph was set to a fixed projected width of 50 , and a projected extraction width of 76 was used .",
    "the large aperture was used to minimize seeing - dependent aperture effects ( peterson et al .",
    "the position angle of the slit was kept fixed at 90 .",
    "a grating ruled at 350 lines mm@xmath9 was used , giving a dispersion of @xmath102  per pixel and a resolution of @xmath1010 . during this program , two different ccds",
    "were used : through 1991 , a texas instruments model 4849 chip with 384@xmath11592 22@xmath12 m pixels , and from 1992 onward , a tektronix 512@xmath11512 chip with 27@xmath12 m pixels .",
    "the wavelength range covered by the observations was somewhat larger than the 46005400  range used in this paper .",
    "most observations were comprised of multiple ( usually three ) 20-minute integrations .",
    "the bias subtraction , flat - field correction , wavelength calibration , and standard - star flux calibration were done in the standard way using the iraf data - reduction package .",
    "the wavelength calibration was based on either fe  ne or he  ar discharge - tube spectra .",
    "cosmic - ray hits were identified and removed to the fullest possible extent by comparison of individual exposures .",
    "absolute spectrophotometry of faint sources is a difficult task , as changes in atmospheric transparency and seeing highly influences the number of photons entering the spectrograph entrance aperture .",
    "only rarely are conditions identical for observations of program objects and standard stars , and as a rule , spectrophotometric accuracy better than 10% is rarely achieved with ground - based observations . seeing and",
    "transparency variations have weak wavelength dependence , however , so standard calibration techniques yield accurate _ relative _ spectrophotometry . in the case of seyfert galaxies , _ absolute _ photometric accuracy can be achieved by using the narrow emission lines as internal flux standards , since these generally do not vary on the time scales of interest to us .",
    "the narrow emission lines arise in a spatially extended low - density region ; long light - travel and recombination times ( both typically 1001000 years ) ensure that variations on much shorter time scales will not occur .",
    "the absolute flux scale in each case is established by measuring the [ ] @xmath1 flux in the minority of spectra that were obtained under photometric conditions , as judged by the observer on site and at the data reduction stage , where individual exposures were compared . in table  2",
    ", we give the absolute fluxes that we have determined for the nine seyfert galaxies in this study .    a potential problem with this method of flux calibration is that seeing - dependent aperture effects can be important , particular if the narrow - line region is spatially resolved and comparable in size to the projected entrance aperture of the instrument .",
    "it is in principle possible to correct for such effects by simulated aperture photometry of emission - line and host - galaxy images ( wanders et al .",
    "1992 ; peterson et al .",
    "however , none of the objects here has extended emission of sufficient strength to affect any of our results .",
    "once the absolute [ ] flux is determined for each source , we scale each spectrum by a multiplicative constant so that the [ ] flux in each spectrum of a given object is the same . we carry this out by comparing each spectrum to a high signal - to - noise `` reference '' spectrum that is constructed by averaging all of the highest - quality spectra and scaling this to the correct absolute flux .",
    "the scaling is accomplished by using the automatic scaling program developed by van groningen & wanders ( 1992 ) , which performs the task in a fast , reliable , and objective way , and has been successfully used on a number of data sets .",
    "the program also corrects for small zero - point wavelength - calibration errors between the individual spectra , and takes resolution differences into account .",
    "the resulting set of calibrated spectra is therefore highly homogeneous .",
    "a few of the spectra were poorly focused , which made flux calibration very difficult and the results extremely suspect .",
    "these spectra were removed from the data base .",
    "all of the acceptable spectra were used to compute an average spectrum for each object . for each source",
    ", we also computed a root - mean - square ( rms ) spectrum , defined as @xmath13 ^ 2\\right\\}^{1/2},\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over the @xmath14 spectra , and @xmath15 is the average spectrum .",
    "the rms spectrum is thus a measure of the variations around the mean , and constant features , such as narrow emission lines , galactic absorption lines , and the non - variable parts of the broad emission lines and the continuum , are eliminated .",
    "any narrow - line residuals visible are due to imperfections in the data calibration .",
    "these are usually very small ( @xmath16% in any given spectrum ) , but add up in the rms spectrum , often rendering them visible . the mean and rms spectra for these objects",
    "are shown in figs .",
    "once all of the spectra have been calibrated , continuum and emission - line flux measurements were made . for each object , the continuum flux is measured in band about 1520  wide at around 5100  in the rest frame of the object , as this is the most line - free region in this part of the spectrum .",
    "the exact wavelength limits used vary from object to object , depending on the strength and width of various emission lines , especially the  blends .",
    "the  emission - line flux is measured in a simple fashion .",
    "first , and underlying continuum is interpolated between the local minima between @xmath17 and   on short - wavelength side of  and between  and the  blend on the long - wavelength side of .",
    "we then integrate the total flux above this continuum between the short - wavelength limit and a point just shortward of the [ ] @xmath18 line .",
    "this measurement includes some  emission as well as the narrow - line  component , and misses  flux at high positive radial velocities , i.e. , the extreme redward wing of the feature .",
    "however , this simple measurement is sufficiently good for our current goals , and is model independent .",
    "the wavelength boundaries for this various integrations are given in table  3 .",
    "in each case , the wavelengths limits given are in the observed frame .",
    "column  ( 1 ) identifies the object , and column ( 2 ) gives the lower and upper bounds of the continuum region .",
    "the  integration limits are given in column ( 3 ) ; the  flux is taken to be the total flux above the linear pseudo - continuum defined by the limits given in column ( 4 ) . in some , but not all , cases ,  emission can also be determined , and these measurements will be reported elsewhere .",
    "it is also apparent from some of the rms spectra that some iron features , such as @xmath19 in mrk 335 , mrk 590 , and mrk 817 , also have varied .",
    "assigning uncertainties to the light curve measurements is not straightforward , and we treat this problem in a heuristic manner .",
    "most of the spectra have high signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath20 ) , and for these we assign uncertainties based on differences between observations that are closely spaced in time ( within a few days of each other ) .",
    "this provides a conservative error estimate , since any real low - amplitude amplitude variability is attributed to random error ; the uncertainties may thus be somewhat smaller than those we assign by this method .",
    "we assign fractional errors of 0.02 to continuum and emission - line measurements .",
    "some of the spectra , however , are of lower quality , usually on account of abnormally short exposure times due to high airmass ( at the beginning or end of an observing season for a particular source ) or on account of poor or highly variable atmospheric transparency . to assign errors to these spectra",
    ", we first determine an apparent `` signal - to - noise '' ratio for each spectrum by computing the standard deviation of the flux values in the continuum band at about 5100  in the rest frame ( this is usually based on 710 pixels ) . for high quality data ,",
    "this apparent @xmath5 is lower than the actual signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra because weak emission and absorption structures are counted as random noise .",
    "for spectra with apparent @xmath21 , we assign a fractional error of @xmath22 to both the continuum and line measurements .",
    "we tested this procedure by first producing very high @xmath5 spectra by averaging a large number of the highest quality spectra of each source , and then performing monte carlo simulations where we added random gaussian - distributed noise to the spectrum and measured the continuum and emission - line fluxes in the same fashion as the real spectra .",
    "a large number of realizations for a given @xmath5 revealed that the standard deviation of the measured fluxes was approximately equal to the mean flux divided by @xmath5 .",
    "thus , all continuum and emission - line flux measurements are taken to be accurate to @xmath3% , except those based on lower - quality data , in which case the fractional errors in both the continuum and line fluxes are taken to be @xmath22 .",
    "the final light curves for the various objects are shown in figs .",
    "the data can be obtained in tabular form through the world - wide webpeterson / agn/. ] .",
    "all measurements are in the observer s frame , and are uncorrected for galactic extinction .",
    "the general sampling characteristics of the light curves plotted in figs .",
    "412 are given in table 4 .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the source name and column ( 2 ) gives the total number of observations that comprise the light curve .",
    "column ( 3 ) gives the number of days spanned by the observation , and the average and median intervals between observations are given in columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , respectively .",
    "the primary targets ( akn 120 , mrk 79 , mrk 335 , mrk 509 , and mrk 590 ) are all well - sampled , with median intervals between observations of 78 days for a span of 78 years .",
    "the larger average intervals between observations are an effect of seasonal gaps that occur when the sources are near conjunction and thus unobservable . of the other sources , mrk 110 and mrk 817",
    "are also well - sampled , but for only 45 years .",
    "both 3c 120 and mrk 704 are quite poorly sampled , as will become apparent when we carry out the time - series analysis .",
    "all of the sources observed underwent significant continuum and emission - line variations .",
    "statistics that describe the variations are given in table 5 .",
    "for each object , we give for both the continuum and , the average flux @xmath23 ( columns 2 and 5 ) , the normalized variability amplitude @xmath24 , i.e. , the rms fractional variability corrected for measurement uncertainties , as defined by rodrguez - pascual et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( columns 3 and 6 ) , and the ratio of maximum to minimum flux @xmath25 ( columns 4 and 7 ) .",
    "the average continuum flux reported here is the value used to compute the luminosity given in table 1 .",
    "the variability parameters have not been corrected for the constant contaminants , starlight in the case of the continuum , and the  narrow - line components in the case of the line .",
    "these issues are beyond the scope of this contribution and will be dealt with in the future .",
    "the primary goal of this program has been to determine for each of these sources the time delay , or lag , between the continuum and  flux variations .",
    "the existence of time delays is in most cases apparent from close inspection of the light curves .",
    "we quantify these time delays by cross - correlating the continuum and emission - line light curves for each object .",
    "most of the light curves are well - sampled , so the cross - correlation method that we use is the interpolation cross - correlation function ( iccf ) introduced by gaskell & sparke ( 1986 ) and gaskell & peterson ( 1987 ) . in cases",
    "where there are significant gaps in the data that may compromise the validity of linear interpolation between adjacent measurements , we have also employed the discrete - correlation function ( dcf ) method ( edelson & krolik 1988 ) as a check on the results .",
    "the specific implementations of the iccf and dcf that we employ are described by white & peterson ( 1994 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the cross - correlation results are estimated by using the model - independent fr / rss monte carlo method described by peterson et al .",
    "each monte carlo simulation consists two parts , which are referred to as `` random subset selection '' ( rss ) and `` flux randomization '' ( fr ) .",
    "the rss procedure consists of randomly drawing from a light curve @xmath14 points a new sample of @xmath14 points , chosen without regard to whether any particular point has been previously drawn . in this",
    "regard , rss is reminiscent of a standard statistical `` bootstrap '' , although it differs in that the temporal order of the points must be preserved .",
    "it is only _ after _",
    "@xmath14 points have been selected that the redundant selections are removed from the sample .",
    "this effectively reduces the number of points in each light curve by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "the rss procedure thus accounts for the effects that individual data points may have on the cross - correlation by removing them at random .",
    "the second part of the procedure ( fr ) is intended to account for the effects of flux - measurement uncertainties .",
    "the observed fluxes are altered by random gaussian deviates scaled to the uncertainty ascribed to each point .",
    "peterson et al .  ( 1998 ) demonstrate that under a wide variety of fairly realistic conditions the combined fr / rss procedure yields conservative errors , in the sense that the real uncertainties may in fact be somewhat smaller than the errors quoted .",
    "cross - correlation calculations have been carried out using the entire data set for each source , and in most cases , also using data from single seasons ( usually spanning about 200 days ) in which the variability characteristics were favorable for accurate detection of a lag .",
    "the only data set that failed to yield a statistically significant lag estimate was that for mrk 704 , which is not surprising as this is the most poorly observed galaxy in our sample .",
    "cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) computed from each data set in its entirety are shown in fig .",
    "13 , which shows in each case the iccf ( continuous line ) and dcf ( individual error bars ) . in each case , the iccf and dcf are in excellent agreement near the peak , which is the area of interest .",
    "the iccf and dcf often show disagreement for lags of 100 days or more , since it is in this regime where the large seasonal gaps become important and the underlying assumptions of the iccf begin to break down .",
    "the peaks and centroids of the ccfs are , however , generally in good agreement .",
    "the results of our cross - correlation analysis are presented in table 6 .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the object name , and the subset of the light curve used in the calculation is given in column ( 2 ) .",
    "the iccf centroid @xmath27 is given in column ( 3 ) .",
    "the peak of the cross - correlation function occurs at a lag @xmath28 ( column 4 ) and has value @xmath29 ( column 5 ) .",
    "the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the iccf is given in column ( 6 ) , and the total number of observations in the light curve appears in column ( 7 ) .",
    "the centroid @xmath27 is computed using all points with correlation coefficients @xmath30 .",
    "the uncertainties given for @xmath27 and @xmath28 were computed with the fr / rss methodology ; a large number ( @xmath31 ) of monte carlo realizations were used to build up a cross - correlation peak distribution ( ccpd ; maoz & netzer 1989 ) , which is then integrated to given the uncertainties .",
    "the range of uncertainties contain 68% of the realizations , and thus would correspond to @xmath32 uncertainties for a normal distribution .",
    "inspection of table 6 shows that both @xmath28 and @xmath27 can vary considerably among the various subsets .",
    "while this might plausibly be ascribed to real physical changes in the structure of the blr ( e.g. , wanders 1995 ) , the differences probably are simply indicative of a thick blr ( i.e. , the ratio of outer to inner radius is much greater than unity ) . for a simple linear model of the line response @xmath33 , we can write @xmath34 which is known as the transfer equation , and @xmath35 is the transfer function ( blandford & mckee 1982 ) , which depends on the blr geometry , viewing angle ( inclination to the line of sight ) , and the line - reprocessing physics . by convolving this with the continuum light curve @xmath36 , it is easy to show that the cross - correlation function ( ) can be written @xmath37 and  is the continuum autocorrelation function ( penston 1991 ; peterson 1993 ) .",
    "the ccf is thus sensitive to the particulars of the continuum variations .",
    "we performed some simple experiments by convolving the observed continuum light curves with model transfer functions for thick spherical shells .",
    "we found that it is relatively simple to obtain a wide range of lags if the geometry is thick and the response not strongly biased to particular radii .",
    "this point was first made by netzer & maoz ( 1990 ) to explain the large differences in the  response determined by peterson et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and netzer et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . again",
    ", this is a topic that will be pursued more completely elsewhere .    in table 7 , we summarize the cross - correlation results . for @xmath27",
    ", we adopt the value that gives the smallest uncertainty for each source , and we adopt @xmath38 as an estimate of the blr size . in the cases where subsets of the light curves yield the smallest fr / rss error estimates ,",
    "we show the cross - correlation functions based on the minimum - error subset in fig .  14 .",
    "we have also measured the width of the broad  line in the rms spectrum @xmath39 , since this provides a measure of the radial - velocity distribution of the gas that is actually varying .",
    "we adopt as a keplerian velocity @xmath40 ( netzer 1990 ) and we use this to obtain a virial estimate of the mass of the central source @xmath41 we give the virial mass for each source in column ( 4 ) of table 7 .",
    "these masses are highly uncertain since neither the geometry nor the kinematics of the blr are known ; indeed , we have assumed that the blr velocity field is not primarily radial , which seems to be generally consistent with the reverberation results for other galaxies . in any case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) should contain a numerical factor of order unity that is depends on the detailed geometry and kinematics of the blr .",
    "thus the masses given in table 7 are valid only as order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "we conclude this section with some brief comments on a few of the objects .",
    "continuum and emission - line variability was first reported in this source by oke , readhead , & sargent ( 1980 ) and french & miller ( 1980 ) , who placed an upper limit on the size of the -emitting region of @xmath42pc @xmath43light days .",
    "our light curve is not particularly well - sampled ; however , we do find a statistically significant lag , but with a large formal uncertainty ( @xmath44days ) .",
    "the galaxy akn 120 is of special interest to us , as it provided the original evidence that the blr is more compact than thought at the beginning of the last decade ( peterson et al .  1985 ) .",
    "through the mid-1980s , we monitored akn 120 regularly with the osu ids ( see peterson , korista , & wagner 1989 , and references therein ) .",
    "several problems prevented obtaining an accurate measurement of the lag :    1 .   the temporal sampling , originally selected on the assumption that the blr was a light year or so in radius , was too poor to resolve the line response .",
    "the typical uncertainties in the ids measurements were @xmath108% ; short time - scale , low - amplitude variations simply could not be detected .",
    "3 .   the narrow [ ] @xmath45 , 5007 lines are unusually weak in akn 120 ( see figs .",
    "13 ) , and flux calibration based on [ ] @xmath1 is less reliable than it is normally .",
    "this leads to systematic `` correlated errors '' in the continuum and emission - line fluxes at zero lag ; i.e. , any error in the [ ] @xmath1 calibration introduces a systematic error that drives the continuum and line fluxes in the same direction , thus artificially enhancing the cross - correlation at @xmath46 .",
    "the large flux uncertainties presented the biggest problem with the earlier ids data , since simulations suggested that the systematic correlated errors would not matter if the total error level could be decreased by a factor of two or more ( gaskell & peterson 1987 ) .",
    "in fact , replacement of the ids spectrograph with the ccd spectrograph has decreased the uncertainties by a factor of four .",
    "the combined ids and ccd continuum and  light curves of akn 120 are shown in fig .",
    "the dramatic improvement in the signal - to - noise of the light curves between the two instruments is readily apparent .",
    "it might seem disturbing that the amplitude of variability seems to have decreased with the advent of the improved instrument , but this type of behavior is seen in more homogeneous data as well .",
    "mrk 509 ( fig .",
    "9 ) shows a similar episode of violent variability followed by lower - amplitude variations .",
    "since it was these dramatic variations in akn 120 that led us directly to programs such as reported here , we do not regard the difference between the variations seen in the early 1980s and those in the early 1990s as especially suspicious .",
    "figure 16 shows the result of cross - correlating the ids continuum and  light curves ( also shown in fig .",
    "17 of peterson , korista , & wagner 1989 ) .",
    "the centroid of the iccf shown in fig .",
    "16 is @xmath47days , which is certainly erroneous because the systematic errors have not been included in the fr / rss simulations .",
    "the sharp peak at zero lag demonstrates the strong influence of correlated errors in this source .",
    "peterson , korista , & wagner point out that the asymmetric part of this function peaks at @xmath48days , which is generally consistent with the results reported in table 6 , based on the higher - quality ccd data .",
    "the asymmetric peak around zero lag is also found using the dcf method , also shown in fig .  16 .",
    "this is contrary to what is stated by edelson & krolik ( 1988 ) , and due to the fact that the version of the dcf code used by edelson & krolik contained an error in how the data were weighted ( see white & peterson 1994 , footnote 2 ) .",
    "our version of the dcf does not weight the data at all .",
    "figure 16 should be compared directly with fig .",
    "@xmath49 of edelson & krolik .",
    "the cross - correlation lags that we obtain for akn 120 are also generally consistent with the estimates of gaskell & peterson ( 1987 ) ( @xmath50days , based on a monte carlo model that included the effects of correlated errors ) and of peterson & gaskell ( 1991 ) ( @xmath51days , based on combined uv / optical data obtained during the largest outburst ) .",
    "markarian 79 has been included on our list of priority sources since the early 1980s , as our first observations with the osu ids showed it to be one of the highest - amplitude variables in our survey ( peterson , crenshaw , & meyers 1985 ) .",
    "like akn 120 and ngc 5548 , it was included in our monthly monitoring program in 198385 ; these data failed to yield a cross - correlation lag , apparently because the light curves were badly undersampled ( peterson & gaskell 1986 ) .",
    "oddly enough , over eight years of our ccd - based program , mrk 79 has been one of the _ least _",
    "variable sources in our sample .",
    "the variations were sufficient , however , for a lag to be measured from the entire data set , as well as in four individual subsets .",
    "our interest in mrk 110 dates back to 198384 when we observed an enormous change in the strength of @xmath17 in two spectra obtained a year apart ( peterson 1988 ) .",
    "this behavior is also apparent in the rms spectrum of mrk 110 shown in fig .  2 .",
    "this galaxy was included in our sample on the basis of an earlier study by shuder ( 1981 ) that suggested the variations would be well - resolved by weekly monitoring .",
    "a preliminary analysis based on most of the data presented here was presented by kassebaum et al .",
    "the light curves presented here supersede those presented by kassebaum et al . , but the cross - correlation results are not changed substantively by using the revised light curves .",
    "most of the data presented here previously appeared in a large compilation by carone et al .",
    "the new data presented here have simply been appended to the light curves presented by carone et al .",
    "the mean and rms spectra shown in fig .",
    "2 , however , are based _ only _ on the osu ccd spectra .",
    "markarian 590 was included in our program because our early ids observations showed that it underwent enormous variations .",
    "additional observations indicated that the emission - line variations were concentrated in the core of the line ; the wings apparently vary much less , leading ferland , korista , & peterson ( 1990 ) to suggest that the high radial - velocity  emission arises in an optically thin gas .",
    "a preliminary version of a subset of our ccd observations ( jd24480902448323 ) has been previously published ( peterson et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "we included both of these sources as secondary targets rather late in the program , based on their position in the sky and because they have interesting , complex  profiles .",
    "mrk 704 was too poorly sampled to yield a cross - correlation result ; nevertheless , interesting profile variations were observed , as seen in the rms profiles in fig .",
    "3 . these will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "in this contribution , we have reported on the initial results of an eight - year spectroscopic monitoring program on seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "most of these sources were observed nearly weekly whenever they were accessible , making these and ngc 5548 ( peterson et al .",
    "1994 ) especially well - suited to the study of long - term continuum and emission variability in non - blazar agns .",
    "for the best - sampled galaxies in our sample , we have over 100 homogeneous spectra .    of the nine sources presented in this paper , we were able to measure  response times , or lags , for eight of them .",
    "the lags range from a little more than two weeks to more than two months , as summarized in table 7 . in many cases ,",
    "the lags are measurable with data from individual observing seasons .",
    "these sometimes show variations from year to year , and this probably indicates that the blr is physically thick , i.e. , the outer radius of the blr is much greater than the inner radius .",
    "we have combined the measured blr response times with measured widths of the  rms profiles to obtain virial mass estimates for the central source .",
    "these are all in the range @xmath0 .",
    "we are grateful for support of this program by the national science foundation under grants ast9420080 , and its predecessors , ast8702691 , ast8915258 , and ast9117086 .",
