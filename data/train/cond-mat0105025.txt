    "the observation of impurity - assisted tunneling in vertical transport experiments on double - barrier semiconductor heterostructures@xcite led to the possibility of using the resonant impurity level as a local probe of electronic states of electrodes prepared from heavily doped degenerate semiconductors .",
    "a number of experiments in strongly asymmetric double - barrier structures have measured directly the local density of states ( ldos ) of an electrode as a function of excitation energy @xmath1 from the fermi level,@xcite those with the highest spectral resolution reporting features including zeeman splitting of single - particle levels in a disordered emitter.@xcite    the idea of such experiments is illustrated by the sketch in fig .",

    "electrons tunnel from a heavily - doped disordered emitter through the energetically lowest level of the quantum well sandwiched between the double barriers .",
    "this energetically lowest level of the quantum well serves as the spectrometer @xmath2 . at zero bias ,",
    "the energy of this impurity level , @xmath3 , does not coincide with the chemical potential @xmath4 in the emitter .",
    "it comes to resonance only after the bias voltage reaches a threshold value @xmath5 .",
    "typical current - voltage i(v ) characteristics of such a device can be divided into three intervals:@xcite one interval below the threshold , where @xmath6 ; the threshold regime @xmath7 , where @xmath8 undergoes a jump when the resonant level crosses the fermi level @xmath4 in the emitter , and the interval of a plateau , @xmath9 , where the current remains nearly constant .",
    "the latter interval lasts until the next impurity level @xmath10 is lowered enough to contribute to the transport and it is ideal for studying the image of the ldos in the emitting reservoir,@xcite since any further variation of the current as a function of bias voltage , @xmath8 is dominated by the energy dependence of the tunneling density of states in the emitter , @xmath11 . a convenient way to look at such i(v )",
    "characteristics is to plot the differential conductance @xmath12 , in which the image of variation in ldos is more pronounced .    in a disordered medium ,",
    "the energy dependence of the ldos studied at a certain point of a sample reveals an irregular fine structure,@xcite @xmath13 , which arises from quantum interference of elastically scattered quasi - particles diffusing coherently within a length scale related to their lifetime at a particular energy .",
    "since the aharonov - bohm phase accumulated by a diffusing particle in a magnetic field changes the interference pattern , such a fine structure , @xmath14 depends randomly on a magnetic field @xmath15 . in tunneling experiments , the interfering quasiparticle is , in fact , a ` hole ' in the fermi sea left behind by the tunneling of an electron out of the emitter with @xmath16 .",
    "being in a non - equilibrium state , such a hole ` floats up ' towards the fermi level , due to inelastic collisions between electrons , so that it can be characterized by a finite lifetime equivalent to a broadening of emitter states.@xcite the broadening of emitter states washes out the finest features in the ldos fluctuations , and , therefore , it strongly affects the amplitude and correlation parameters of fluctuations of the differential conductance@xcite of a given resonant tunneling device , @xmath17 . a particularly convenient situation to study fluctuations",

    "recently , we reported@xcite an experiment where the speeding up of the quasi - particle relaxation upon the increase of the energetic distance to the fermi level ( equal to the excitation energy of the fermi sea holes ) was observed via the decline in the variance of differential conductance fluctuations at higher bias voltages , @xmath20 . in the present publication",

    "the differential conductance of a resonant tunneling structure has been measured for a dense grid of magnetic field values , which has largely increased the statistical ensemble of data used in the evaluation of the correlation function @xmath22 of a random pattern @xmath23 , @xmath24 and has allowed us to compare details of its shape to the results of a theoretical analysis .",

    "this fine structure is formed by electrons which tunnel from below the emitter fermi level through the lowest discrete state @xmath2 in the quantum well .",

    "for a narrow spectrometer , as studied in the present work , inelastic broadening of states in the bulk exceeds the spectrometer width upon increasing the excitation energy of a quasi - hole left in the emitter .",
    "then , this inelastic broadening affects the parameter of the fluctuation pattern .",
    "note that the observed fluctuations become sharp and large again after the second impurity level begins to contribute to the current at @xmath52  mv .",
    "this is because tunneling through the second impurity state involves states close to the fermi energy which have negligible inelastic broadening . in the following ,",
    "we shall focus on the tunneling through the lowest lying impurity state , i.e. on the interval of bias voltages smaller than @xmath53  mv . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gv_av ] the differential conductance is shown after averaging the raw data @xmath54 over the interval of magnetic field specified above .",
    "this averaging increases the contrast between the main peak corresponding to the spectrometer @xmath2 crossing the emitter fermi level and @xmath55 at larger bias voltages , where a random contribution from ldos fluctuations is strongly suppressed .",
    "the fluctuations are suppressed by a statistical weight of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the number of uncorrelated g(v ) traces taken at various magnetic fields . the plot in fig .",

    "is intrinsically limited by inelastic broadening of quasi - particle states in the emitter , @xmath65 . as a result",

    "the same combination of energetic parameters also determines the variance of the differential conductance fluctuations , @xmath68 , which will be discussed in subsection b.      the experimental determination of the correlation function , @xmath69 , consists of the evaluation of the variance @xmath70 and , then , the autocorrelation function of the measured differential conductance fluctuations pattern , @xmath71 by means of averaging over different magnetic field points within the interval 0@xmath721 t .",
    "then , the obtained correlation function is additionally averaged over a narrow interval of bias voltage , not more than 2 - 3 times broader than the width of the autocorrelation function determined after the first step .",
    "this procedure allows improved statistics and it slightly reduces variations in the form of the correlation function .",
    "note that the finite amount of data used in this analysis still leaves space for statistical errors , so that the evaluated correlation function may be treated seriously only within an interval equal to 3 times its width at the half - maximum .",

    "the numerical procedure outlined here is necessary only in the crossover regime since the exact geometry of the emitter is not relevant in the limiting cases : in the quasi-2d limit a diffusing electron typically does not reach the boundary of the disk and it is thus possible to integrate over all harmonics of the diffusion propagator in the plane of the disk whereas in the quasi-0d limit the zero mode in the plane of the disk is not damped very effectively and it dominates , enabling one to neglect all higher harmonics .",
