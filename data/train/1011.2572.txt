    "thus , if we push the size of the box to literally infinity , we face a divergence coming from infrared region  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have checked that as we push the infrared cutoff towards larger and larger scales , the contributions of the non - linear corrections increase .",
    "this infrared divergence may be removed with appropriate manipulations , e.g. boundary effects  @xcite .",
    "conversely , we can find that the integrals in @xmath111 diverge in the large @xmath138 limit .",
    "this should be regarded as the breakdown of our approximation near and inside the horizon scale .",
    "thus the ultraviolet cutoff we have chosen in ( [ uvcutoff ] ) , horizon scale cutoff , is the maximum value of @xmath138 we can have : beyond this value , we are probing sub - horizon regime where our approximation is invalid .",
    "we may choose more conservative cutoff , for example @xmath139 .",
    "the net effect of pushing @xmath140 to a smaller value is to suppress the non - linear corrections , since as mentioned above the integrands in @xmath111 become bigger at larger @xmath138 .",
    "in this note , we have studied the non - linear corrections to the power spectrum of the comoving curvature perturbation produced during single field slow - roll inflation .",
    "all the scalar perturbations in the metric and the inflaton field are described in terms of the gauge invariant comoving curvature perturbation @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath18 to the linear order is gaussian , we need up to third order perturbation to describe the leading non - linear contributions to the power spectrum . under the assumptions of large scale limit and slow - roll approximation ,",
    "we have solved the equation of @xmath18 perturbatively up to third order . using these solutions ,",
    "we have computed the power spectrum @xmath141 including the leading non - linear corrections .",
    "the resulting power spectrum is , on super - horizon scales , dominated by the linear contribution @xmath91 , and the non - linear corrections are negligible .",
    "our study indicates that we can safely rely on linear cosmological perturbation theory to study power spectrum originated from quantum fluctuations .",
