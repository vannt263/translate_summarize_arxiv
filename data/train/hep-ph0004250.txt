    "it should be stressed that the very first successful phenomenological model of multiparticle production , the so called landau hydrodynamical model , was proposed already in the pre - accelerator era of 1953 and used in the analysis of specific multiparticle data taken from cosmic ray interactions @xcite .",

    "2 . the last section contains final remarks together with a list of other possible hints of nonextensivity not discussed in detail here ( including topics from qgp physics @xcite and nonextensivity manifested in the statistics of the quantum states produced in the scattering process such as @xmath22nucleon or @xmath22nucleus scatterings @xcite ) .",
    "our encounter with the notion of nonextensivity started when we realised that one of our previous results concerning the occurence of the so called _ long flying component _ in the propagation of the initial flux of incoming cosmic ray particles ( mostly nucleons ) @xcite can be interpreted as yet another manifestation of the lvy distribution ( [ eq : prob ] ) @xcite . to be more specific let us briefly summarize the result of @xcite .",

    "whereas at small depths ( up to @xmath26 cm of lead ) we observe the usual absorption of hadrons as given by the simple exponential formula @xmath27 at biggest thickness there is , against all expectations , noticeably excess of experimental points above the simple extrapolation of small - depth data .",
    "the observed discrepancy means that original hadrons tend to fly longer without interaction ( that is why a term _ long flying component _ is coined for this type of phenomenon ) .",
    "+ in @xcite we have argued that the observed effect can be just another manifestation of the fluctuation of the corresponding hadronic cross section @xmath28 ( where @xmath5 denotes the mass number of the target and @xmath29 is the mass of the nucleon , such a possibility is widely discussed in the literature and observed in diffraction dissociation experiments on accelerators , cf .",
    "@xcite for details and references ) .",
    "it turned out that fluctuations of this cross section ( i.e. , in effect , fluctuations of the quantity @xmath30 ) with relative variance @xmath31 allow to describe the observed effect . + it turns out @xcite that the same data can be fitted by the nonextensive formula @xmath32^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } \\label{eq : q13}\\ ] ] with parameter @xmath33 ( in both cases @xmath34 in @xmath35 defined above ) , cf .",

    "in fact , precisely from such exponential fits to transverse masses @xmath40 one infers information about the temperature @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , any deviation from the exponential behaviour of such distributions are always under detailed scrutiny in which one is searching for the possible causes .",
    "in @xcite it was suggested that the extreme conditions of high density and temperature occuring in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions can lead to memory effects and long - range colour interactions and to the presence of non - markovian processes in the corresponding kinetic equations @xcite . + as it is seen in fig .",
    "2 one indeed finds @xcite a small deviation from the exponential behaviour ( on the level @xmath41 ) .",
    "as we shall demonstrate in section 4 it can , however , lead to quite dramatic effects .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that to first order in @xmath42 the generalized slope becomes the quantity @xmath43 with @xmath23 being temperature of _ a purely thermal source_. this should be contrasted with the empirical relation for the slope parameter @xmath23 , from which the freeze - out temperature ( at which hadrons are created from the qgp ) @xmath44 is then deduced , @xmath45 the @xmath46 is a fit parameter usually identified with the average collective ( transverse ) flow velocity of the hadrons being produced . in ( [ eq : tq ] ) one has , instead , _ a purely thermal source _ experiencing a kind of blue shift at high @xmath47 ( actually increasing with @xmath47 ) .",
    "the nonextensivity parameter @xmath0 accounts here for all possibilities one can find in @xcite and could , therefore , be regarded as a new way of presenting experimental results with @xmath16 signaling that there is something going on in the collision that prevents it to from being exactly thermal - like in the ordinary sense mentioned above . + we shall proceed , now , to two other examples of possible nonexponential distributions . first is the attempt @xcite to fit the energy spectra in both the longitudinal and transverse momenta of particles produced in the @xmath20 annihilation processes at high energies .",
    "those are , contrary to the previous example , the most elementary high energy multiparticle production processes .",
    "the initial @xmath20 pair annihilates to a virtual photon which subsequently gives rise to a ( highly excited ) quark - antiquark pair .",
    "they in turn develop a complex hadronization process related to the long - distance ( strong coupling ) regime of quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) .",
    "usually being described in terms of the so called string model @xcite it admits also , for low energies , a kind of thermodynamical equilibrium approach @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that when going to higher energies one can not keep the temperature @xmath48 inferred from the @xmath49 distributions constant , invalidating therefore the whole concept . on the other hand , using instead the nonextensive power - like ( @xmath0-dependent ) distribution , one can write the following transverse momentum distribution @xcite : @xmath50^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } \\label{eq : hagq}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath51 is longitudinal momentum of secondary particle of mass @xmath38 and @xmath0 is the entropic index ) . keeping the temperature @xmath48 essentially constant and changing only @xmath0 one can now fit data extremely well , cf .",

    "is then regarded as a manifestation of nonextensivity arising in the hadronization process in which quarks and gluons combine together forming hadrons , a process which involves long range correlations in the phase space . actually , this observation has general validity and applies to all production processes discussed here as well .",
    "it applies , most probably , also to a pure elastic quantum scattering processes discussed in @xcite .",

    "dynamical _ fluctuations of interest from the _ trivial _ geometrical ones due to the impact parameter variation ( resulting in the different number of nucleons participating in a given event ) . to solve this problem",
    "it was proposed in @xcite to use the following measure of fluctuations or correlations : @xmath92 here @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the mean value of the observable @xmath8 calculated for all particles from all events ( the so called inclusive mean ) and @xmath53 is the number of particles analysed in the event . in ( [ eq : fi ] ) @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    "are averages of event - by - event observables over all events whereas the last term is the square root of the second moment of the inclusive @xmath97 distribution .",
    "@xmath98 equals zero when the correlations are entirely absent . on the other hand ,",
    "it is constructed in such a way as to be exactly the same for nucleon - nucleon and nucleus - nucleus collisions if the latter is a simple superposition of the former .",
    "the @xmath98-measure has been successfully applied to the experimental data ( cf .",

    "this time the measure @xmath98 can became positive or negative for both fermions and bosons depending on the value of the entropic index @xmath0 . actually in @xcite it was found that for @xmath101 mev and @xmath102 the @xmath98-measure vanishes for @xmath41 .",
    "+ the clear prediction of @xcite , which can consist a subject for experimental verification , is that the @xmath49-dependence of partial contributions to @xmath103 should become negative for @xmath104 gev .",
    "notice that in this regime the @xmath98-measure should already be free from contaminations from resonance decays and , therefore , the experimental confirmation of this prediction would provide a strong signal for the nonextensivity present in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "+ the @xmath98-measure is applicable not only to fluctuations of kinematical quantities such as @xmath49 but also to the azimuthal @xcite and chemical fluctuations as well .",

    "the representive sample of results is shown in fig .",
    "5 for @xmath41 mentioned above . for simplicity",
    "we have restricted ourselves , here , only to comparison with results of @xcite without resonances @xcite .",
    "actually , one expects that for a given @xmath0 fluctuations should grow with the mass of detected particle - this observation provides yet another possibility for experimental verification of the nonextensivity concept .",
    "the general picture emerging from the previous discussion is that one can account very economically ( by introducing only one new parameter @xmath0 ) and adequately ( by using nonextensive formulas emerging from tsallis statistics with entropic index @xmath0 ) for a number of observations deviating from the normal bg approach .",
    "the question of the possible meaning of entropic index in these cases is therefore very natural . for the cases discussed in section 2 we would like to propose that @xmath0 is connected with fluctuations present in the system under investigation .",

    "it is then natural to expect that these fluctuations ( which were so far described in @xcite only numerically by means of monte carlo simulations ) should be formulated in such a way as to result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) with a parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the same should be also true for the heavy ion collision example . actually , this example is even more important and interesting because of the long and still vivid discussion on the possible dynamics of temperature fluctuations @xcite and because of its connection with the problem of qgp production in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "we shall , therefore , treat both cases as representing the same class of fluctuation phenomena and claim that _ the parameter @xmath0 is a measure of fluctuations _ present in the lvy - type distributions ( [ eq : t ] ) describing the particular process under consideration .",

    "it could mean therefore that we are dealing here with some fluctuations existing in small parts of the system in respect to the whole system ( according to interpretation of @xcite ) rather than with fluctuations of the event - by - event type in which , for large multiplicity @xmath53 , fluctuations @xmath144 should be negligibly small @xcite .",

    "it should be stressed that in this way we have addressed the interpretation of only very limited cases of applications of tsallis statistics .",
    "they belong to the category in which the power laws physically appear as a consequence of some continuous spectra within appropriate integrals .",
    "it does not touch , however , a really _ hard _ case of applicability of tsallis statistics , namely when _",
    "zero _ lyapunov exponents are involved @xcite . nevertheless , this allows us to interpret some nuclear collisions data in terms of fluctuations of the inverse temperature , providing thus an important hint to the origin of some systematics in the data , understanding of which is crucial in the search for a new state of matter , the quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the are also other imprints of nonextensivity which we shall only mention .",
    "one is connected with recent analysis @xcite of the equilibrium distribution of heavy quarks in fokker - planck dynamics .",
    "it was demonstrated that thermalization of charmed quarks in a qgp proceeding via collisions with light quarks and gluons results in a spectral shape which can be described only by the tsallis distrubution @xcite . on the other hand in @xcite the quantum scattering processes ( such as @xmath180 and @xmath181 ) scatterings",
    "were analysed using tsallis - like entropies and strong evidence for the nonextensivity were found there when analysing the experimental data on the respective phase shifts . on",
    "the boundary of really high energy collisions is the very recent application of the nonextensive statistics to the nuclear multifragmentation processes @xcite .",
    "the other examples do not refer to tsallis thermostatistics directly , nevertheless it can be demonstrated that they are , at least approximately , connected to it .",
    "we would like to refer here to a recent attempt to study , by using the formalism of quantum groups , the so called bose - einstein correlations between identical particles observed in multiparticle reactions @xcite and also works on intermittency and multiparticle distributions using the so called lvy stable distributions @xcite .",
    "they belong , in some sense , to the domain of nonextensivity because , as was shown in @xcite , there is close correspondence between the deformation parameter of quantum groups used in @xcite and the nonextensivity parameter @xmath0 of tsallis statistics and there is also connection between tsallis statistics and lvy stable distributions @xcite .",
    "some traces of the possible nonextensive evolution of cascade type hadronization processes were also searched for in @xcite . the quantum group approach @xcite",
    "could probably be a useful tool when studying delicate problem of interplay between qgp and hadrons produced from it .",
    "it is plausible that description in terms of @xmath0-deformed bosons ( or the use of some kind of interpolating statistics ) would lead to more general results than the simple use of nonextensive mean occupation numbers @xmath21 discussed above ( for which the only known practical description is limited to small deviations from nonextensivity only ) .",
    "+ to the extend to which self - organized criticality ( soc ) is connected with nonextensivity @xcite one should also mention here a very innovative ( from the point of view of high energy collision ) application of the concept of soc to such processes @xcite . + to summarize , it has been demonstrated that multiparticle processes bear also some signs of nonextensivity observed in other branches of physics , which shows up only as small deviations from the expected behaviour .",
    "these deviations were already explained by invoking some additional mechanisms and , because of this , the use of @xmath0-statistics is not so popular or known in this field as in others discussed in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the use of @xmath0-statistics is probably best seen from the information theoretical point of view .",
    "the new parameter @xmath0 can be regarded then as a kind of compactification of all processes responsible for the actual nonextensivity into one single number @xcite .",
    "this is also the point of view expressed in @xcite where the new approach to quantum field theory based on lorentzian , instead of gaussian , path integrals has been proposed .",
    "it would allow to account for the possible deviations of pure stochasticity in a similarly most economical way when one introduces a single new parameter .",
    "this is , however , so far unexplored domain of research .",
