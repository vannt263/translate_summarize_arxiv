    "it is well known that in the field a contaminant plume spreads at a higher rate than as predicted by theory and lab experiments .",
    "in addition , one observes that the spreading pattern often deviates from the gaussian pattern , especially at early times ( tailing ) .",
    "these phenomena have been analyzed intensively , theoretically , numerically and by field experiments ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of papers on this subject attribute these phenomena to the heterogeneity of the medium . in our paper",
    "we show that in a homogeneous aquifer a similar behavior occurs when contaminants are subject to a relatively slow kinetic adsorption / desorption reaction .",
    "we consider a homogeneous medium and follow a ( solute ) particle during its motion through the pore system , while simultaneously it is subject to adsorption / desorption .",
    "although the porous medium itself is simply homogeneous and non - stochastic , the particle s behavior is still chaotic and , therefore , our particle model will be stochastic . note that our approach differs from that of papers on particle tracking in the sense that we do not start with the advection - dispersion - reaction equations and , accordingly , perform a particle tracking algorithm to solve or simulate the equations .",
    "instead , we start with a stochastic description for the movement of a single particle and work our way towards the differential equations .",
    "particle tracking papers assume an analogy between particle tracking and the differential equations either by just stating the validity of this analogy or by referring to previous papers on particle tracking . to our knowledge",
    "a rigorous derivation of the differential equations for advective - dispersive transport with kinetic sorption starting from a stochastic model for a single particle does not exist in any of those papers .",
    "we also discuss particle models used in various other fields , such as the velocity jump model ( chemotaxis or movement of bacteria , hillel ) .",
    "this velocity jump model ( giddings - eyring model ) leads to a telegraph equation .",
    "it differs from our model by the fact that there is no diffusion or dispersion phenomenon .",
    "we will demonstrate that , when the velocity jump is extended with dispersion / diffusion , the telegraph character stills remains .",
    "this explains the non - gaussian behavior in the pre - asymptotic stage .",
    "the non - gaussian features can also be illustrated by ( spatial ) moments , especially by the third ( skewness ) and fourth ( kurtosis ) centralized moments .",
    "for the 1d situation first and second moments were studied by previous authors e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these papers mainly focused on the large time ( asymptotic ) results . pre - asymptotic expressions for first and second moments",
    "were first derived by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in the formulation of the solutions michalak and kitanidis suggest that for an arbitrary initial distribution of the phases the mean and variance in each separate phase can be obtained by a linear combination .",
    "however , this is only true for the non - centralized moments , but not for the variance .",
    "moreover , one of the 4 solutions is incorrect ( see section [ 1dmoment ] , also @xcite ) . in our paper",
    "we shall consider the moments for the 2d situation and examine in detail the conditional moments .",
    "these moments manifest more clearly the non - gaussian behavior than the 1d or marginal moments .",
    "it shows that non - gaussian behavior can exist , even when the marginal moments suggest that the behavior is gaussian .    in our ` particle view ' the behavior of a particle",
    "is described by a random walk and a two state markov process .",
    "a similar model was used by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we do not use different notations for the one- and two dimensional particle densities .",
    "we assume that their distinction will be clear from the context .",
    "it appears that the effect of transverse dispersion is much more dramatic than that of longitudinal dispersion , while its solution is much easier to derive .",
    "therefore , we analyze longitudinal and transverse dispersion separately and start by including transverse dispersion first .",
    "we use an approach proposed by  @xcite . consider two distinct species , one adsorbing and one non - adsorbing .",
    "let the spatial distribution of the non - adsorbing solute be given by @xmath187 .",
    "further , let @xmath152 be the ` free residence time ' of the adsorbing particles and let the distribution of @xmath152 at time @xmath16 be @xmath188 , i.e. for particles in phase @xmath189 with an initial unit pulse in phase @xmath81 ( see by ( [ gidtau ] ) ) .",
    "if the initial pulse is @xmath190 , the particle fraction with free residence time @xmath152 at time @xmath16 becomes @xmath191 , where @xmath192 .",
    "the spatial distribution of this fraction is equal to that of the non - adsorbing particles at @xmath193 , or : @xmath194    summing fractions with @xmath152 , @xmath195 , we obtain : @xmath196 we apply van kooten s approach first to the case with only transverse dispersion . for a non - adsorbing solute with advection in the @xmath123-direction and dispersion in the @xmath197-direction ( @xmath185 is assumed zero ) the distribution is : @xmath198 insert this function in the integral ( [ methodekoot ] ) . because of the delta function the integral can be evaluated directly .",
    "after substitution of @xmath152 by @xmath199 we obtain : @xmath200 for a given value of @xmath123 , expression ( [ 2dsolution ] ) describes the distribution in @xmath197-direction of a certain amount of particles .",
    "the amount is equal to @xmath201 per unit of length in @xmath123-direction and it spreads in the @xmath197-direction as a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath202 .",
    "the transverse variance now depends on the @xmath123-coordinate , which is clearly in conflict with a 2d gaussian distribution .",
    "the interdependence of transverse variance and @xmath123-coordinate can be understood by considering the residence times in the free phase . during the ` free phase ' time particles travel in positive @xmath123-direction and simultaneously spread in the @xmath197-direction . at a given time",
    "@xmath16 the particles that have spent more time in the free phase are found further along the @xmath123-direction .",
    "they are also more widely spread in @xmath197-direction , since they have been subject to dispersion for a longer time .",
    "further , note that for @xmath203@xmath204 the functions @xmath205 are zero .",
    "therefore , @xmath206 is zero for @xmath207 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : onlytransverse ] this is illustrated by 2d contours for unit initial pulses in the free and adsorbed phase .",
    "the following scaled coordinates are used : @xmath208 for a gaussian distribution with dispersion coefficients @xmath139 and @xmath209 in the longitudinal and transverse direction one would expect elliptic contour - lines .",
    "figure [ fig : onlytransverse ] , however , shows typical ` cigar'-shaped contours .",
    "it is clear that close to the original injection point ( in figure [ fig : onlytransverse ] around @xmath210 ) the particles have spend a relatively short time , @xmath152 , in the ` free ' phase . during this time",
    "the particles displace not only very little in longitudinal direction , but also the spread in transverse direction is very limited .",
    "the result of this is that @xmath123 displacement and @xmath197-spread are no longer independent , which is in contradiction to a truly gaussian system .",
    "also note that in the 1d case in figure [ figureno1 ] the same parameters have been used and the corresponding distribution in @xmath123-direction comes out almost as a gaussian curve ( figure [ figureno1 ] , upper right graph ) .",
    "analytical solutions including longitudinal and transverse dispersion have been obtained by @xcite , but not in a closed - form .",
    "the integral expression by carnahan is , in essence , equal to the one obtained by van kooten s approach : @xmath211 we apply expression ( [ koot2d ] ) to evaluate the ` full ' system ( i.e , including advection , dispersion and sorption ) using the following values : @xmath47 = 0.2 , @xmath46 = 0 , @xmath10 = 1 , @xmath185 = 0.5 and @xmath186 = 0.1 .",
    "the kinetics induced dispersion coefficient @xmath139 now becomes 0.62 , which is in the same order of magnitude as @xmath185 .",
    "the contour - lines in figure [ fig : full2d ] represent the distribution of the free phase for @xmath16 = 1 , @xmath16 = 20 and @xmath16 = 150 , for the case of an initial pulse in equilibrium .",
    "note that for longitudinal and transverse coordinate we have applied the same scaling as in figure 4 , ( see ( [ scales ] ) ) . at a short time ( @xmath16 = 1 ) almost circular contours occur , which suggests gaussianity . at this stage microdispersion",
    "dominates the spreading process , which now progresses in a gaussian way . at an intermediate time ( @xmath16 = 20 ) the ` cigar'-shaped contours start to develop . here , we observe an increasing influence of the non gaussian kinetics - induced dispersion .",
    "finally , at large times ( @xmath16 = 150 ) the distribution becomes gaussian again , with elliptic contours .",
    "the parameters of the early and late gaussian distribution are quite different . for short times",
    "we have velocity @xmath10 and dispersion coefficients @xmath185 and @xmath186 . for large times",
    "the velocity becomes @xmath122 and dispersion coefficients @xmath212 and @xmath213 for the longitudinal and transverse direction respectively .",
    "the early gaussian distribution occurs because directly after the start of the pulse the effect of kinetic exchange between the phases is still small and the free phase consists mainly of particles that did not yet change their state .",
    "therefore , they behave as a non - adsorbing solute . as time goes on the influence of kinetics",
    "becomes more apparent and ` cigar ' shaped contours develop .",
    "the method of moments was introduced by @xcite , while studying the flow of solutes through a capillary tube ( taylor dispersion ) . later",
    ", the method was successfully applied to solute transport in a layered porous medium by @xcite . for contaminant transport with sorption",
    "the method was applied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors examine the asymptotic values of zero , first and second moments .",
    "solutions for the entire pre - asymptotic regime of zeroth , first and second moments are derived by @xcite . however , one of their expressions for the central second moment turns out to be incorrect .",
    "we copy here the formula ( the @xmath214 is a @xmath215 ) , but should be a @xmath216 ) from @xcite , page 2136 for the normalized central moment , where the solute is in the free phase at time 0 _ and _ at time @xmath16 : @xmath217 here michalak and kitanidis abbreviate @xmath218 , and use the notation @xmath219 by giving the expressions for @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 michalak and kitanides suggest that these expressions may be used to obtain variances for a general initial condition , by linearity .",
    "however , such a superposition can only be composed for the non - centralized moments . at large times the first and second moment",
    "appear to increase at a constant rate , which suggest that there exist an effective velocity @xmath224 and effective dispersion coefficient @xmath225 : @xmath226      the 2d case is described by the equations ( [ eq2d-2 ] ) .",
    "we may distinguish two different type of moments .",
    "the first type is that of the marginal moments , or moments with respect to the @xmath123-coordinate ignoring the information on the @xmath197-coordinates of the particles .",
    "the second type consist of conditional moments , either a moment with respect to @xmath123 for a given value of @xmath197 , or a moment with respect to the @xmath197 and for a given value of @xmath123 .",
    "interestingly , the marginal moments for the 2d case are identical to the moments for the 1d case . in the following subsections",
    "we discuss the conditional moments .",
    "this category of moments represent expected values of @xmath227 for a population of particles with a specific @xmath197-coordinate .",
    "note that these moments are a function of @xmath197 .",
    "we define these moments as : @xmath228 for @xmath229 the expressions represent for each phase the particle distribution along the @xmath197-direction ( the total mass of particles with the specified @xmath197-coordinate ) .",
    "note that the higher order moments ( @xmath230 ) are not yet divided by the zeroth moment , so higher order moments are not normalized . for the initial condition",
    "we consider a ( unit ) pulse with the phases in equilibrium .",
    "then , the two - dimensional particle distribution becomes : @xmath231 where @xmath81 is @xmath5 or @xmath4 .",
    "this expression is obtained by applying ( [ koot2d ] ) , replace @xmath153 by @xmath232 ( see ( [ eq_definition ] ) ) and take @xmath233 equal to 1 . for the equilibrium initial condition the moments are : @xmath234 when we use ( [ kooteq ] ) and change the order of integration , the zeroth , first and second moments become : + @xmath235 @xmath236 @xmath237     + figure [ fig : mom0a ] shows the distribution along the @xmath197-axis for the zeroth moments of free and adsorbed phase for several times .",
    "the initial condition here is the equilibrium situation .",
    "the zeroth moment is plotted horizontally .",
    "the figure shows that particles of both phases gradually spread out in @xmath197-direction .",
    "note in the figure at the right hand side that at @xmath16=5 the adsorbed phase is concentrated along @xmath238 and the curve has a pulse - shaped component @xmath239 for @xmath197=0 .",
    "this pulse represents the particles that did not yet spend time in the free phase and are still in the initial position . at larger times most adsorbed particles",
    "do have spent time in the free phase and the spreading in @xmath197-direction becomes visible .",
    "figure [ fig : mom1a ] shows the first moment for the free phase .",
    "the first moment , plotted horizontally , can be interpreted as the average distance travelled in the @xmath123-direction for the particles with a specific @xmath197-coordinate .",
    "as it appears , for @xmath197 = 0 the first moments are smaller than for values of @xmath197 greater or smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "it is an alternative illustration of the tailing effect .",
    "particles spending less time in the free phase have less opportunity to displace in the @xmath123-direction and spread in the @xmath197-direction .",
    "thus , a considerable fraction of these particles are found around the point of origin .",
    "further away from the @xmath197-axis particles occur that have been able to disperse laterally .",
    "therefore , they did spend some time in the free phase and , consequently , were also displaced further along the @xmath123-axis .",
    "once more , we conclude that displacements in @xmath123- and @xmath197-direction are mutually dependent .",
    "this dependence in the spreading pattern is non - gaussian .",
    "the @xmath197-moments conditioned on @xmath123 are defined as : @xmath240 we analyze the @xmath197-moments by the laplace transform using the following initial conditions : @xmath241 after applying the laplace transform to eq ( [ eq2d-2 ] ) and eliminating the transform of @xmath242 we obtain the following differential equation : @xmath243 where @xmath244 denotes the particle density in laplace space , @xmath245 is the laplace parameter and @xmath44 is an expression depending on @xmath245 : @xmath246 @xmath247 is related to @xmath248 by ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq2d-2 ] ) ) : @xmath249    after taking the moments with respect to @xmath197 we find for the zeroth moment : @xmath250 the solution for @xmath251 is @xmath252 where we use that the concentrations are zero at @xmath253 the inverse can be found with numerical laplace inversion algorithms @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and is shown in figure [ mzeroy ] .    for the second moment we obtain the equations : @xmath254 where we use that @xmath255 , with the solution:@xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "the ratio of the numerically  @xcite inverted @xmath258 and @xmath259 is the normalized and centralized second moment ( conditioned on @xmath123 ) and this ratio turns out to be @xmath260 .",
    "thus , the lateral spread depends on @xmath261 , which ( again ) explains the tailing and the previously observed ` cigar shape ' .",
    "we discuss a stochastic particle approach , considering a particle that changes between a mobile and immobile state governed by a markov chain , while its spatial displacement is governed by a random walk .",
    "generally , particle models are assumed to describe the advective - dispersive - kinetic transport process correctly , but in the literature a rigorous proof is lacking .",
    "our analysis shows that it is possible to derive the correct set of differential equations from a stochastic model for a single particle .",
    "+ to examine the non - gaussian nature of the spreading process we analyze first the telegrapher s equation .",
    "this equation arises when only advection and kinetic sorption is considered .",
    "we show that in such a system an apparent dispersion process occurs , generated only by the kinetic changing of the particle in states with different velocities ( i.e. @xmath262 or @xmath10 ) .",
    "this ` kinetics - induced ' dispersion is non - gaussian for short and intermediate times , while at large times the process develops as gaussian dispersion . when hydrodynamic dispersion is included again , the spreading process becomes a combination of a gaussian and non - gaussian dispersion .",
    "we illustrate this for the 2d case . at short times",
    "the process is gaussian , since hydrodynamic dispersion is the dominating process . at intermediate times",
    "the influence of kinetic induced dispersion increases and the spreading becomes non - gaussian .",
    "finally , at large times the dispersion becomes gaussian again , but the ( effective ) longitudinal dispersion coefficient has an additional term due to the kinetics .",
    "moveover , we find for the 2d case that the transverse spreading depends on the longitudinal coordinate , resulting in ` cigar - shaped ' contours .",
    "the mechanism is best illustrated when longitudinal dispersion is assumed zero . here",
    "the particles displace in the @xmath123-direction by advection and spread transversely by dispersion .",
    "particles spending more time in the adsorbed phase are displaced less in @xmath123-direction , and also less spread out in @xmath197-direction . in a truly gaussian distribution",
    "the transverse spreading is independent of the longitudinal coordinate .",
    "when longitudinal dispersion is included the same effect is observed , although for short times ( compared to the kinetic exchange rate ) the situation is now dominated by hydrodynamic dispersion .",
    "with respect of the validity of effective properties ( velocity and dispersion ) , we conclude the following .",
    "the velocity and dispersion coefficients are represented by the rate of increase of the first and centralized second moment ( times @xmath263 ) . for cases with low adsorption and desorption rates ,",
    "the rates of increase for the moments remain time dependent for a relatively long time .",
    "we conclude that constant effective properties can not be defined directly after the start of solute injection . for large times an asymptotic behavior",
    "is observed with a constant mean displacement and rate of dispersion , while the third moment vanishes and the kurtosis approaches a value of 3 .",
    "this can be proved via our stochastic model by applying a sophisticated version of the central limit theorem ( section [ mandv ] ) .",
    "the critical time , required before dispersion coefficients becomes constant , is in the order of @xmath264 .",
    "the effective velocity is @xmath265 , similar to the case of linear equilibrium adsorption .",
    "however , at early times the free particles move with the original groundwater velocity and build up a lead with respect to the adsorbed phase .",
    "in the asymptotic stage , the adsorbed and free particles displace with the same average velocity , but the lead of the free plume is maintained",
    ". the effective longitudinal dispersion , can be much higher than in the case of linear equilibrium adsorption .",
    "the additional term , @xmath266 depends also on the groundwater velocity .",
    "it is remarkable that it depends on @xmath267 , while the micro - scale dispersion is linear in @xmath10 .",
