    "in large @xmath1 qcd , the gauge group is su(@xmath1 ) and a baryon is made of @xmath1 quarks .",

    "when the su(@xmath3 ) symmetry is exact the mass operator @xmath4 has the general form @xmath5 the coefficients @xmath6 encode the qcd dynamics and have to be determined from a fit to available data , while the operators @xmath7 are su(2@xmath3 ) @xmath8 so(3 ) scalars of the form @xmath9 here @xmath10 is a @xmath11-rank tensor in so(3 ) and @xmath12 a @xmath11-rank tensor in su(2)-spin , but invariant in su(@xmath3)-flavor .",
    "@xmath13 represents the minimum of gluon exchanges to generate the operator . in practical applications , terms of order @xmath14",

    "the operators @xmath21 break su(3)-flavor symmetry and the coefficients @xmath22 have to be fitted in a global fit of nonstrange and strange baryons .",
    "the classification scheme used in the @xmath0 expansion for baryon resonances is based on the standard su(6 ) classification as in a constituent quark model .",
    "baryons are grouped into excitation bands @xmath23 , 1 , 2 , ",
    ", each band containing at least one su(6 ) multiplet .",
    "the band number @xmath24 is the total number of excitation quanta in a harmonic oscillator picture .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath22 depend on @xmath24 .",
    "the approximate spin - flavor symmetry of baryons containing two light and one heavy quark is su(6)@xmath25 su(2)@xmath26 @xmath25 su(2)@xmath27 , _ i.e. _ there is a separate spin symmetry for each heavy flavor . for these baryons ,",
    "an @xmath28 expansion can be combined with the @xmath0 expansion , @xmath29 being the heavy quark mass . in the case of an exact su(3)-flavor symmetry , the mass operator reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the total spin of the light quark pair ( of the heavy quark ) .",
    "the unknown coefficients have to be fitted to experimental data , but physical and dimensional arguments suggest to introduce a typical qcd energy scale @xmath33 and the relations @xmath34    the inclusion of su(3)-flavor breaking leads to an expansion of the mass operator in the su(3)-violating parameter @xmath350.3 , where @xmath36 is the average mass of the @xmath37 , @xmath38 quarks and where @xmath39 is the strange quark mass",

    "the confinement potential is a y - junction in which the toricelli point is replaced by the center of mass @xmath44 .",
    "it is also necessary to include some perturbative corrections , namely one - gluon exchange and quark self - energy mass terms , respectively @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the strong coupling constant between the quarks @xmath47 and @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the kinetic energy of the quark @xmath47 . the factors @xmath50 and ( @xmath51 )  gev have been computed in lattice qcd .",
    "@xmath52 is analytically known and can accurately be fitted by @xmath53 with @xmath54 for @xmath55 and by @xmath56 with @xmath57 for @xmath58 .    within our model",
    ", we have @xmath59 . in this case , using the auxiliary field technique , analytical mass formulas can be obtained for both light @xmath60 and heavy @xmath61 baryons at order @xmath62 and @xmath63 . for light baryons one has @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) with @xcite @xmath66 we refer the reader to  @xcite for the explicit expression of @xmath67 . in these equations , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath11 is a corrective factor equal to @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) for @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) baryons , resulting from the replacement of the toricelli point by the center of mass .",
    "moreover , @xmath24 is the baryon band number in a harmonic oscillator picture , just as the one which is used in large @xmath1 qcd as in section  [ seclnc ] .",
    "this allows a direct comparison between both approaches .    for heavy baryons",
    "one has @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , with  @xcite @xmath74 the interested reader will find the explicit expressions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 in ref .",
    "moreover , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the band number @xmath24 corresponds this time to the relative quantum of excitation of the heavy quark and the light quark pair .",
    "the heavy quark ",
    "light diquark picture is favored since the quark pair tends to remain in its ground state  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath6 appearing in the @xmath0 mass operator can be obtained from a fit to experimental data and compared with the quark model results .",
    "the dominant term @xmath79 in the mass formula  ( [ massoperator ] ) contains the spin- and strangeness - independent mass contributions , which in a quark model language represents the confinement and the kinetic energy .",
    "so , for @xmath80 , we expect @xmath81 figure  [ fig1 ] ( left panel ) shows a comparison between the values of @xmath82 obtained in the @xmath0 expansion method and those derived from eq .",
    "( [ m_qqq ] ) for various values of @xmath24 .",

    "( left ) and @xmath20 ( right ) versus the band number @xmath24 .",
    "the values computed in the @xmath0 expansion ( full circles ) from a fit to experimental data are compared with the quark model results with @xmath83  gev@xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87  gev ( empty circles and dotted line are given to guide the eyes).,width=472 ]    the spin - dependent corrections between quarks @xmath47 and @xmath48 should be of order @xmath88 . therefore we expect both @xmath89 and @xmath90 to be proportional to @xmath91 : such a behavior is consistent with the large @xmath1 results , where it is also observed that the spin - spin contribution ( @xmath90 ) is much larger than the spin - orbit contribution ( @xmath89 )  @xcite .",
    "the mass shift due to strange quarks is given in the quark model by @xmath92 .",
    "a comparison of this term with its large @xmath1 counterpart is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right panel ) , where we can see that the quark model predictions are always located within the error bars of the large @xmath1 results . in both approaches ,",
    "one predicts a mass correction term due to su(3)-flavor breaking which decreases with @xmath24 .",
    "the heavy quark masses @xmath93 and @xmath94 can be independently fitted to the experimental data in both the quark model and the @xmath0 frameworks  @xcite . in large @xmath1 qcd one",
    "obtains @xmath95  mev and @xmath96  mev , while the quark model mass formula  ( [ m_qqq ] ) is compatible with the experimental data provided that @xmath97  mev and @xmath98  mev ( the other parameters have been fitted to light baryons ) . both approaches lead to quark masses that differ by less than 5% .",
    "the other parameter involved in the large @xmath1 mass formula is @xmath33 , which in the ground state band can be identified to the mass formula ( [ m_qqq ] ) as follows : @xmath99 .",
    "according to the large @xmath1 fits one has @xmath100  gev while the quark model gives 0.333  gev , which means a very good agreement for the qcd scale @xmath33 .",
    "the terms of order @xmath28 lead to the identity @xmath101 .",
    "the large @xmath1 parameter @xmath102  gev gives @xmath103  gev@xmath84 and the quark model gives 0.091 gev@xmath84 , which is again a good agreement . finally , the su(3)-flavor breaking term is proportional to @xmath104 .",
    "one should have @xmath105 by definition of @xmath106 ; indeed the large @xmath1 value @xmath107  gev and the quark model estimate @xmath108  gev also compare satisfactorily .",
    "we point out that , except for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , all the model parameters are determined from theoretical arguments combined with phenomenology , or are fitted on light baryon masses .",
    "the comparison of our results with the @xmath0 expansion coefficients @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath106 are independent of the @xmath29 values .",
    "so we can say that this analysis is parameter free .",
    "an evaluation of the coefficients @xmath89 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 through the computation of the spin - dependent effects is out of the scope of the present spin - independent formalism .",
    "but at the dominant order , the ratio @xmath113 should be similar to @xmath114  mev , which is roughly in agreement with equation  ( [ largenpar ] ) stating that @xmath115 .",
    "we have established a connection between the quark model and the combined @xmath0 , @xmath28 expansion both for light baryons and for heavy baryons containing a heavy quark .",
    "our results bring reliable qcd - based support in favor of the constituent quark model assumptions and lead to a better insight into the coefficients @xmath6 encoding the qcd dynamics in the @xmath0 mass operator . as an outlook , we mention that a combined quark model  @xmath0 expansion could lead to predictions for excited heavy baryons masses or even for ground state masses of baryons with two heavy quarks .",
