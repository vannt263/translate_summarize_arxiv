    "other groups found similar results when starting from this relatively small value of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the likelihood of @xmath4-nucleus quasi - bound states existing would increase significantly if the @xmath4-nucleon scattering length were much larger than that assumed by haider and liu in 1986 . in the subsequent years , widely differing estimates have been given for @xmath11 , with some real parts being as large as 1  fm ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary .",
    "theoretical studies by ueda  @xcite gave some hints that the @xmath4 meson might form a quasi - bound state with @xmath12he and even with deuteron .",
    "the states could be narrow and lightly bound in few - nucleon systems and therefore might be observed through their effects above threshold .    according to the watson - migdal theory  @xcite , when there is a weak transition to a system where there is a strong final state interaction ( _ fsi _ ) , one can factorise the @xmath2-wave reaction amplitude , @xmath13 , near threshold in the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath4 c.m .",
    "the unperturbed production amplitude @xmath16 is assumed to be slowly varying and is often taken to be constant in the near - threshold region .",
    "unitarity demands that the imaginary part of the scattering length be positive , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , to have binding , there must be a pole in the negative energy half - plane , which requires that  @xcite @xmath18 finally , in order that the pole lie on the bound- rather than the virtual - state plane , one needs also @xmath19 .    the unexpectedly large near - threshold production amplitude in the case of the @xmath20he reaction , as well as its rapid decrease with rising energy  @xcite ,",
    "were interpreted as evidence for a strong @xmath2-wave _ fsi _ , which might be associated with the formation of a @xmath21he quasi - bound system  @xcite .",
    "analogous experimental data on the @xmath22he reaction  @xcite show an amplitude that varied more slowly than in the case of @xmath21he . a combined analysis to the two data sets within the framework of a simple optical potential yielded scattering lengths  @xcite",
    "@xmath23 taken at face value , these suggest that there are poles in both amplitudes close to threshold but that , whereas the @xmath24he system might be quasi - bound , the scattering length for @xmath21he does not satisfy the condition of eq .",
    "( [ equ : cond2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , more recent very refined measurements of the @xmath25he differential cross section show even larger @xmath21he scattering lengths  @xcite .",
    "these prove that there is a pole in the complex energy plane within about 1  mev from threshold and this is confirmed by the energy dependence of the angular distribution  @xcite .    in order to isolate the @xmath2-wave amplitude for @xmath26he , it is necessary to measure differential and not merely total cross sections  @xcite .",
    "this has been done by the anke collaboration at an excess energy of @xmath27  mev  @xcite . however , as shown there , even differential cross sections are not completely sufficient for this purpose and the analysis of these and the earlier data is model dependent .",
    "although there is only one @xmath2-wave amplitude , observed deviations from isotropy might be a purely @xmath28-wave effect or could result from an interference of the @xmath2- with the @xmath29-wave  @xcite .",
    "the only way to decide between these two solutions is through the determination of a deuteron analysing power in conjunction with the differential cross section .    in this paper we present results of a measurement of @xmath30 and",
    "the tensor analysing power @xmath0 at @xmath31  mev , which allows us to resolve this ambiguity .",
    "the experiment was carried out using the big karl spectrograph  @xcite and the basic setup is described in section  [ sub : experim - setup ] .",
    "it was carried out in two stages , first using an unpolarised beam , as discussed in section  [ sub : unpolar - angular - distrib ] . in order to extract an analysing power , the beam polarisation had to be established and the way of doing this",
    "is explained in section  [ polar_setup ] and then used in the measurement of @xmath0 in section  [ sub : polariz - cross - section - measure ] .",
    "the results for the unpolarised differential cross section are presented in section  [ sub : unpolar - cross - section ] and analysed in terms of the partial wave and invariant amplitudes  @xcite in section  [ sub : partial - wave - amplitu ] .",
    "it is shown that , if we neglect @xmath32-waves in the @xmath3 system , the magnitude of the @xmath2-wave amplitude could be determined from measurements of differential cross section and @xmath0 .",
    "the data clearly favour @xmath2@xmath29 interference as the origin of the angular dependence .",
    "the results are compared in section  [ sub : s - wave ] with those obtained at lower energies and together these go a long way in clarifying the ambiguities regarding the @xmath2-wave scattering length .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the gem collaboration measured the @xmath33 reaction at the cosy - jlich accelerator using vector and tensor polarised deuteron beams .",

    "the big karl magnetic spectrograph  @xcite employed for this study is equipped with two sets of multi - wire drift chambers ( mwdc ) for position measurement and thus track reconstruction .",
    "two layers of scintillating hodoscopes , 4.5  m apart , led to a more accurate time - of - flight measurement than previously achieved with big karl .",

    "crossed scintillator paddles , working in coincidence , were used as luminosity monitors .",
    "they were calibrated by using scattered particles from a beam with reduced intensity that were directly counted in an exit window in the side yoke of the dipole @xmath37 on the way to the beam dump .",
    "the detectors were therefore named the left and right beam - dump monitors . whereas the beam telescope saturates for intensities above about @xmath38s@xmath39 , the luminosity monitors were still far below saturation at beam intensities of the order of @xmath40s@xmath39 .",
