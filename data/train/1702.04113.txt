    "the observational study of stellar kinematics in young clusters provides critical clues on the mechanisms governing cluster formation and early evolution .",
    "the velocities of young stars , in comparison with gas kinematics , can reveal if and for how long the newly formed stellar population follows the initial / early gas flows , which may be due to turbulence , gravitational infall , cloud collisions or some other triggering mechanism .",
    "the star cluster may be forming in a quasi monolithic fashion or the process may involve merging of different sub - clusters .",
    "these mechanisms may be revealed by a study of the kinematics , including kinematic substructure , of the young stars .",
    "subsequent dynamical evolution may involve mixing of orbits , e.g. , as the star cluster virializes as a gravitationally bound system .",
    "alternatively , depending on the overall efficiency of formation from the natal gas clump and degree of gas expulsion , the stellar population may be or become unbound and thus expand with less opportunity for stellar interactions .",
    "depending on the rate of star formation , i.e. , the efficiency per local free - fall time , these potential evolutionary pathways may be followed even while the cluster / clump system is still gas dominated . another way to test different star formation scenarios is thus to measure the velocity dispersion of the cluster and compare it with the value expected from virial equilibrium given the gravitational potential due to the total mass ( stars + gas ) of the system .",
    "great effort has been made over the years to study the dynamical evolution of young clusters theoretically , through n - body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "results reveal a fairly complex picture , in that the dynamical state and evolution of the stellar population , the bound fraction and morphology depend on several factors : the star formation efficiency , the time of gas removal and its duration and the initial configuration of hierarchical / substructured protoclusters .",
    "observationally , some works have analyzed the morphology of young clusters at different ages to constrain their dynamical evolution and initial conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , observations of radial velocities in young clusters are a more powerful tool to probe the current dynamical state , search for and parameterize binary populations , and investigate spatially coherent velocity gradients or substructure that might give clues to the initial conditions or reveal multiple populations @xcite .",
    "these radial velocities , @xmath1 , have generally been obtained from optical high - resolution spectroscopy that reach radial velocity precisions of @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 for individual sources .",
    "this precision is typically not enough to well resolve the kinematics of nearby , relatively low - mass regions of star formation ( e.g. , orion ) , which have velocity dispersions of a few km / s .",
    "also , optical spectroscopy remains limited by dust extinction , thus unable to reach the more embedded stars within young and forming clusters .    in this context , with the infrared spectra of young nebulous clusters ( in - sync ) project @xcite , an ancillary program of the sdss - iii",
    ", we obtained multiobject , near - infrared ( nir ) high - resolution spectra in 3 young clusters .",
    "this program , which used apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) spectrograph , allowed us to derive stellar parameters and reaching radial velocity precisions to @xmath9  km  s@xmath4 down to @xmath10  mag .",
    "the first part of this survey covered the perseus cloud , through their young clusters ic348 ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i and paper  iii ) and ngc  1333 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "we have found evidence for a supervirial stellar population in ic 348 , whereas in ngc 1333 the stars are in close agreement with virial velocities , but the diffuse gas and dense gas have significantly different velocity dispersion .",
    "moreover , we found that stars in ngc 1333 show a similar velocity dispersion to the diffuse gas , whereas the dense cores appear in subvirial motions , unless their dynamics are significantly regulated by large scale magnetic fields .    in a second part of in - sync , we covered the orion a molecular cloud . at the distance of @xmath11",
    "pc @xcite , this filamentary structure includes the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , the closest site of active massive star formation .",
    "sparser populations are present to the north , in the upper sword and ngc 1977 , and to the south , with ngc  1980 and l1641 .",
    "this population has been thoroughly studied at many wavelengths through photometry and spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "memberships have been estimated through optical spectroscopy , presence of ir excess emission @xcite , x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the population has a typical model dependent mean age of @xmath12  myr throughout the region , and in spite of the large extent of the structure ( @xmath13  pc ) .",
    "the only exception is the population around ngc1980 being somewhat older @xcite . in the onc , a large age spread compared to the local free - fall time",
    "is present @xcite , hinting to a slow star formation process relative to the dynamical timescale of this star - forming clouds @xcite .    the kinematic properties of the molecular gas in orion a have been studied in great detail ( e.g. , * ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from tracers such as @xmath14co , @xmath15co and c@xmath16o .",
    "the filament shows a large @xmath17  km  s@xmath4 change in radial velocity over its length , with the south end ( the `` tail '' ) blue - shifted compared to the north end .",
    "also , based on 3d dust mapping , @xcite found evidence that the tail is several tens of pc more distant than the northern end . unless the orion a cloud is stretching out along its orientation in plane of the sky  which is unknown because of the lack of accurate proper motion measurements",
    " this would suggest that the orion a filament is compressing along its length .",
    "as for stellar kinematics , @xcite and @xcite conducted an optical survey measuring @xmath1 in the northernmost third ( @xmath18 long ) of the region , centered on the onc . in this region , they found that young stars velocities follow the gas ( @xmath15co ) velocity , although their distribution is slightly asymmetric with a broad blue - shifted tail not present in the gas component .",
    "they also noted that the large scale @xmath1 gradient steepens north of the onc , which had been interpreted as evidence for large scale infall .    in our in - sync survey , we obtained 4828 spectra of 2691 individual sources throughout the @xmath19 long region .",
    "the spatial distribution of these sources is shown in figure [ figure : radec ] , left panel , together with a @xmath15co map from @xcite . in the previous paper of this series , (",
    "* , hereafter paper iv ) , we used these data to study the properties of the stellar population .",
    "we focused on the fitted stellar parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath1 ) , positioned the sources in the hertzsprung - russel diagram ( hrd ) , and assigned stellar ages . we found a clear confirmation of a genuine age spread throughout the region , from the correlation between hrd ages and surface gravity - derived ages , as well as anticorrelation between ages and ir excess , and ages and extinction .",
    "we also confirmed that the non - embedded population of young stars around ngc1980 is older than the rest of the system , but suggested that it is not part of a well - separated cluster .",
    "this is because the kinematic properties of these sources are indistinguishable from those of younger , more embedded stars at the same position .",
    "based on stellar parameters as well as radial velocities , we found @xmath11 new candidate members .",
    "most of these turn out to be young diskless sources , in portions of the orion a cloud not fully covered by previous studies to assign memberships .",
    "in this paper we continue the analysis of our in - sync dataset , focusing on the kinematics and dynamics of the population .",
    "figure [ figure : radec ] shows a map of the orion region as well as a position ( dec)velocity diagram of our in - sync targets in comparison with that of the molecular gas tracers .",
    "figure [ figure:3dvideo ] shows an animation of the full 3d ( r.a . , dec and @xmath1 ) cube of the data .",
    "it is qualitatively evident that stars follow the global motions of the molecular gas throughout the region , as seen before limited to the north portion of the cloud ( @xmath23 , @xcite ) .",
    "also , unsurprisingly , non - members tend to have velocities that are different from the bulk of the young population .",
    "another feature is the fact that there appear to be more members with @xmath1 lower than the peak value than stars with higher velocities , in line with the results from @xcite that the stellar velocity distribution is asymmetric with a broader blue - shifted wing .    to investigate this possibility",
    ", we construct positional maps of mean stellar velocities .",
    "first we exclude from our analysis all non - members ; we also exclude sources with velocities strongly different from that of the bulk of the population ( @xmath24  km s@xmath4 or @xmath25  km s@xmath4 ) , to exclude outliers that are either erroneous membership or velocity assignment , binary systems , or ejected members .",
    "then , for every angular position in @xmath26 we consider the sources within a circular aperture with radius of @xmath27 , provided that there are at least 30 sources in the aperture , and we compute the weighted average of their @xmath1 values , as well as the median and mode value .",
    "lastly , we smooth each map with a kernel of @xmath28 of radius .",
    "figure [ figure : mean_vel_diff ] shows the derived maps , as well as the difference between stars and gas , color - coded according to @xmath1 and density or flux .",
    "visually , it appears that the difference stars @xmath29 gas , which will be referred to as @xmath30 , is on average more negative then positive , as the overall color leans toward the blue .",
    "in fact , the area - weighted mean value of @xmath30 using the stellar mean velocity is -0.87  km  s@xmath4 , which decreases to -0.44  km  s@xmath4 weighting the result on the stellar density .",
    "these values decrease , respectively , to -0.66  km  s@xmath4 and -0.25  km  s@xmath4 when adopting the mode of the stellar velocities .",
    "therefore , it appears that stars are systematically slightly blue - shifted compared to the gas , and this is in part due to an asymmetry in the @xmath1 distribution , as manifested by the difference between mode and mean @xmath1 .",
    "*    it is possible that this offset is not real , and simply due to zero - point offsets in @xmath1",
    ". however , by comparing our radial velocities with those from @xcite , for 550 matching sources , we find a difference in the values of @xmath31  km  s@xmath4 , much smaller than the offsets between stars and gas . unless both , despite using different instrument and techniques , have a similar systematic error in @xmath1 , this suggests that our in - sync velocities are well calibrated .",
    "figure [ figure : deltav_dec ] shows the dependence of the @xmath32 on position in declination , computed from the maps of figure [ figure : mean_vel_diff ] weighting , in right ascension , on stellar density .",
    "the largest offset is found in the central part of the cloud , at @xmath33 , around l1641-n and ngc1980",
    ". here the mean and mode of the velocity distribution have the largest difference , suggesting a very asymmetric distribution .",
    "as anticipated , and discussed in paper iv , this part of the orion a stellar population is @xmath34 older than the onc and l1641-s and is far less extincted suggesting that it is slightly in the foreground and less associated with the molecular material .",
    "a bias due to incompleteness at high @xmath21 is not the case , since the column density of the molecular material in this region is relatively low , up to a few magnitudes in @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "thus , star formation in orion a initiated earlier in the central part of the cloud , which is closer along the line of sight that the remaining gas in the same direction .",
    "an offset in @xmath1 between stars and gas may have different origins .",
    "one possibility is that the central part of the cloud presented a primordial substructure along the line of sight , both spatially and kinematically .",
    "gas which formed the older population of l1641-n and ngc1980 was closer and with small 1  km  s@xmath4 blue - shifted motion than the remaining gas today .",
    "such offset is in line with the typical turbulent motions within a molecular cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , comparison of mean velocities of @xmath14co(2 - 1 ) and @xmath15co(2 - 1 ) ( expected to trace lower and higher density regions , respectively ) , finds only modest differences of @xmath35  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "however , in studies of infrared dark cloud ( irdc ) filaments , @xcite have found offsets of similar magnitude between denser gas traced by n@xmath36h@xmath37(1 - 0 ) and lower density gas traced by c@xmath16o(1 - 0 ) .",
    "another possibility is that prolonged stellar feedback of this foreground population pushed back on the remaining background gas , which is now receding 1  km  s@xmath4 with respect to the stellar population .    if primordial substructure along the line of sight is present , the asymmetry of the velocity distribution could also originate from the superposition of two kinematically separated substructures of the cloud",
    "since , as shown in paper iv , we found that the @xmath1 distribution around l1641-n does not vary with stellar age , these structures would have needed to sustain star formation at the same time , and with similar duration , which seems somewhat unlikely .",
    "the presence of kinematic substructures in the stellar population of orion a , and their comparison with those of the gas , can provide important clues on the primordial substructure of the parental star - forming gas . on the other hand , smooth distributions in space and velocity",
    "could indicate that dynamical evolution has occurred , since spatial and kinematic substructure is expected to be erased over time in a gravitationally bound system .",
    "evidence of this has been found in the onc @xcite , where the population in the denser , more dynamically evolved core has less spatial substructure in comparison to the cluster outskirts .",
    "an analysis of the kinematic substructure in position - position - velocity ( @xmath38 ) in orion a was presented by @xcite , using a preliminary version of our in - sync data .",
    "these authors adopted a _ friends - of - friends _ algorithm that isolates groups or chains of sources in which the separation of each member of the group , in the @xmath38 space , from another member of the group is smaller than a given threshold . imposing groups with at least 4 sources",
    ", they find 37 of such groups , most of them ( 30 ) in the northern region of the cloud ( l1461n and above ) , significantly more than expected from random positions in @xmath38 space .    to identify substructures , we explore two different techniques .",
    "we construct stellar density maps in @xmath38 space .",
    "to do so , we consider each point of the @xmath38 space and find the closest @xmath39 stars , in @xmath38 to that point .",
    "we adopt a conversion metric such that @xmath40 in spatial distance in ra and dec corresponds to 4  km  s@xmath4 in @xmath1 .",
    "this has been chosen so that the overall spatial extent of the region ( i.e. , in declination ) is comparable with the broadness of the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "the stellar density associated to the point is then @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the volume of the sphere of radius equal to the distance to the @xmath39-th star .",
    "therefore , our density maps naturally trace the density of groupings of stars at a given number scale defined by @xmath39 .",
    "lastly , coherent structures in @xmath38 space are identified as local density maxima on these density maps within a kernel size of 10or 0.66  km  s@xmath4 . for each structure , we also measure the density @xmath43 , as well as the density `` contrast '' @xmath44 against the local background in @xmath38 space , for which we adopted the density maps obtained for @xmath45 .",
    ".substructures in @xmath38 space [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     as before , we run the algorithm to artificially generate distributions in @xmath38 space ( see  [ section : subclustering : peaks ] ) , and investigate different diagnostics to test the significance of the results .",
    "this is summarized in table [ table : ppv - substructures - discrete ] . for each parameter choice",
    "we compare the number of groups @xmath46 isolated from our data with the mean and standard deviation of this quantity from the random experiments ; @xmath47 in this context is the measured excess , in standard deviations , from the result from random experiments .",
    "similarly , @xmath48 is the departure in standard deviations for the fraction of stars belonging to some structure in @xmath38 .",
    "lastly , we use kolmogorov - smirnov test to verify if two cumulative distribution functions are significantly different between our measured values and those from randomly generated distributions . specifically we list @xmath49 as the ks probability ( where a low number indicates significant difference ) of the distribution of peak local densities in @xmath38 of the identified groups , and @xmath50 that of the distribution of number of stars in the detected @xmath51 .",
    "results show that for high values of @xmath52 , the statistical significance is relatively poor or absent .",
    "decreasing @xmath52 , thus enabling a larger number of sources to be labeled as clustered , especially in regions of low density such as l1641 , leads to higher significance .",
    "specifically , we identify a number of @xmath38 structures 24@xmath53 larger than in random experiments , a fraction @xmath54 higher , and probabilities @xmath49 and",
    "@xmath50 less than 1% in most cases .    the fact that we detect statistically significant overdensities in @xmath38 space adopting two conceptually different methods (  [ section : subclustering : peaks ] and  [ section : subclustering - discrete ] ) is highly indicative that kinematic substructure in orion remains present , and thus may be a tracer of the original turbulent motions of the molecular material in the parental cloud .",
    "future observations ( i.e. , multi - epoch ) will help improve the @xmath1 measurements , especially enabling the identification of binaries .",
    "proper motion measurements from the final _ gaia _ survey will be also useful to study kinematic substructures in orion . the degree of kinematic substructure that we measure will also be compared to the results from theoretical / numerical models of star cluster formation under different scenarios ( wu et al .",
    ", _ in prep _ ) .",
    "limited to the onc region of the system , we find evidence for a correlation between radial velocities and extinction , in that sources with higher @xmath21 are statistically more red - shifted compared to less embedded members .",
    "this is shown in figure [ figure : av_deltarv ] , where the offset @xmath30 from the local mean radial velocity is plotted against @xmath21 , for all members within a circular aperture of @xmath40 centered on the trapezium region that defines the center of the onc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also restricted to sources with @xmath55  k , as for higher temperatures the stellar parameters  hence @xmath21 , are more uncertain .",
    "a linear fit through the data shows an increase in @xmath1 of about @xmath560.1  km  s@xmath57 .",
    "a randomization test through the permutation of the values along the @xmath58axis of this diagram showed that this correlation is significant at a @xmath59 level .",
    "both the correlation and its significance level remain unchanged varying the aperture diameter between 0.5 and 2@xmath60 ; the significance reduces at smaller apertures because of low number statistics , and at larger distances outside the onc .    since @xmath21 is a tracer of the depth of a star along the line of sight  even though the distribution and volume density of the dust is spatially inhomogeneous  this result suggests a global expansion along the line of sight .",
    "we exclude that this correlation may be a spurious outcome of correlated systematic effects in the extraction of @xmath1 and @xmath21 , since in @xcite an opposite trend is observed in ic  348 using apogee data and identical data reduction and extraction of parameters as in this work . from the relation @xmath610.1  km",
    "s@xmath57 it follows that the central 90% of the population along the line of sight , with @xmath62 shows an overall @xmath1 spread of @xmath63  km s@xmath4 , or a net maximum expansion from the cluster s midplane of @xmath64  km s@xmath4 .",
    "the reddening distribution is highly asymmetric , with a median @xmath21which could be associated with the cluster s midplane  of 1.3  mag .",
    "note that this fact is not only seen in our in - sync survey , but all previous studies reaching higher completeness and @xmath21 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) ; thus it is not the result of completeness limits of this work .",
    "this implies that the volume density of the molecular material increases along the line of sight .",
    "we are unable to explicitly measure the net velocity offset of two halves of the population from this midplane , as in the low - extinction limit , we do not measure any correlation of @xmath1 with @xmath21 .",
    "this , however , is likely due to the fact that the typical uncertainty in @xmath21 is @xmath65 at all extinctions .",
    "thus , for low @xmath21 the relative uncertainty is particularly high , flattening any @xmath1@xmath21 correlation due to regression dilution .",
    "we look for variations in the measured correlation indicating expansion with mass and age , and divide the stellar samples in two mass ranges ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) and two age ranges on both sides of the median cluster ages .",
    "these parameters have been obtained from @xcite evolutionary models ( paper iv ) .",
    "although we find that lower - mass stars show a large velocity gradient with @xmath21 , and older stars do as well compared to younger ones ( see figure [ figure_av_deltarv_mass_age ] ) , these differences are not statistical significant ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "future data are needed to confirm or not a mass and age dependence of the expansion of the onc .    finally , no correlation between radial velocity and extinction is found along the filament south of the onc ( l1641-n and l1641-s ) .",
    "we obtained the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath5 , for different samples of the orion a population , in a similar fashion as in paper ii and iii for ngc  1333 and ic  348 , respectively , in perseus .",
    "specifically , we measure the width of the @xmath1 distribution , and correct it for the measurement uncertainties as well as the contribution due to binarity . unlike the in - sync survey in perseus ,",
    "our @xmath1 values have only one epoch for the majority of our stellar sample , therefore our binarity correction has been performed statistically .",
    "we adopt a flat mass ratio distribution @xcite , a flat eccentricity distribution @xcite over the whole mass range , and a log - normal period distribution from @xcite . using the tool velbin ( paper ii ) , then , we generated a large number of binary orbits randomly drawn from these parameter distribution , and assuming random orientations we obtained the 1-dimensional distribution of radial velocities of the primary .",
    "thus , the corrected dispersion @xmath5 is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the binary fraction , for which we assumed a value 0.44 , as determined by @xcite for solar - type stars .",
    "our results are largely insensitive on small changes in @xmath70 , since the contribution from multiplicity contributes to the observed @xmath71 by an amount @xmath72  km s@xmath4 , smaller than the typical measurement errors @xmath73 , typically of the order of @xmath74@xmath75  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "figure [ figure : dec_dispersion ] shows the corrected @xmath5 in different bins in declination .",
    "the solid line represents the dispersion as is , adopting the measured @xmath1 for all stars in each bin .",
    "we have also corrected for the spatial gradients in @xmath1 along the region ( see  [ section : gas - vs - stars ] ) , which if not accounted for , may lead to an overestimate the overall @xmath5 in a region . to this end",
    "we adopted the radial velocities as the difference , star by star , between the measured @xmath1 and the local mean radial velocity in that position , as computed in ",
    "[ section : gas - vs - stars ] and shown in figure [ figure : mean_vel_diff ] , second panel .",
    "we refer to these two dispersions as `` standard '' and `` gradient - corrected '' .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ figure : dec_dispersion ] as a dashed line .",
    "overall , @xmath5 has a mean value of @xmath76  km  s@xmath4 , with local variations along the filament .",
    "the most striking feature is an @xmath5 increase in l1641n ; this is consistent with the detected asymmetry of the velocity distribution and the presence of kinematic substructure in this region , possibly indicating spatial structure along the line of sight ( see  [ section : subclustering ] ) .",
    "thus a larger @xmath5 could be the result of superposition of stellar systems with relative bulk mean motions .",
    "the northern part of the system shows a gradient in @xmath77 , increasing from ngc  1980 toward the north of the onc ( ngc  1977/omc 2 - 3 ) . in the onc @xmath78@xmath79 km",
    "these results are in good agreement with the optical radial velocity survey of @xcite , which covered a declination range @xmath80 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of @xmath15co gas is also shown in figure  [ figure : dec_dispersion ] , appearing to have a much smaller velocity dispersion , which is discussed in more detail , below , in the context of the dynamical state of system of stars and gas .",
    "next we focus in more detail on the onc .",
    "figure [ figure : onc_dispersion ] shows the radial dependence of @xmath5 from the center of the cluster . again , we compute both the `` standard '' and `` gradient - corrected '' dispersions .",
    "in fact , given the large north - south velocity gradient in the vicinity of the onc , the standard @xmath5 appears to increase at larger distances ; however , the gradient correction leads to a @xmath5 that is relatively constant with respect to radius , at a value @xmath81  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the measurement of @xcite , as well as the stellar proper motion study of @xcite .",
    "the green line represents the predicted velocity dispersion profile required for dynamical virial equilibrium , as derived in @xcite from the total mass profile of the onc .",
    "this was obtained combining estimates of the total stellar mass profile , from censuses of stellar parameters from the literature , complemented by x - ray and infrared surveys , and estimates of the gas volume density within the onc .",
    "specifically , the stellar component describes a power - law profile slightly steeper than a single isothermal sphere , and the gas was assumed to be at a constant volume density of 22  m@xmath82pc@xmath83 .",
    "this gas density was derived from the stellar @xmath21 distribution , which averages at @xmath84 mag , and not from , e.g. , the total column density of molecular material ; this is because the vast majority of the ism along the line of sight of the onc , reaching up to 100  mag @xcite , lies behind the cluster .",
    "the gas contribution is negligible compared to the stellar mass up to a few half mass radii ( @xmath85  pc , @xcite ) , and is responsible for the increase of the equilibrium @xmath5 at increasing distances from the center .",
    "the mean @xmath5 in the onc required for virial equilibrium based on the total mass is @xmath86  km  s@xmath4 @xcite , which , compared to the measured @xmath87  km  s@xmath4 indicates that the onc is supervirial with a virial parameter @xcite @xmath7 .",
    "this is near the limit for the system to remain bound ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "however , we stress that uncertainties remain : in figure [ figure : onc_dispersion ] we also show the range in the radial profile of the expected virial velocities assuming an uncertainty of 30% in the estimated mass",
    ". this uncertainty is likely quite large for the stellar component , being derived from deep samples at different wavelengths . on the other hand ,",
    "a higher uncertainty may come from the gas component , especially if the distribution of the material along the line of sight  hence the conversion from column densities to volume density  is quite different than in the orthogonal directions , specifically , if the system is more flattened along the line of sight . in any case",
    ", a density of about a factor of two more than currently estimated would be required for the system to appear in virial equilibrium .",
    "the onc s moderately super - virial state , if confirmed , would be compatible with our presented evidence that the cluster is currently expanding ( see  [ section : expansion ] ) .",
    "a straight - forward interpretation may attribute the missing mass  thus the excess in stellar velocities compared to equilibrium  to recent gas expulsion from the cluster location .",
    "this is in agreement with the evidence that the massive stars of the cluster have carved a cavity in the surrounding molecular material , exposing the population as a relatively low - extinction cluster .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , have shown that the virial state of a cluster fluctuates significantly during the early evolution of a stellar system , and the fraction of the stellar population which remains subsequently bound strongly depends on the dynamical state at the time of gas removal .",
    "additional data , such as a scheduled continuation of the in - sync orion survey , to increase the stellar sample and obtain additional epochs for our in - sync targets , as well proper motions from _ hst _ photometry ( hst program go13826 , pi m.  robberto ) or _ gaia _ for the bright end of the population will allow us to better characterize this potential expansion of the onc .",
    "it is also important to stress that a possible infall of material ( gas and stars ) along the filament may affect the future fate of the system .",
    "in fact , @xcite suggested that the large velocity gradient , for both stars and gas , observed to the north of the onc ( see figure [ figure : radec ] ) could indicate an infall of material towards the onc .",
    "we do not find variations of @xmath5 as a function of stellar mass in the onc .",
    "however , we stress that the in - sync survey does not cover massive stars , as the sample is limited to below a few @xmath89",
    ". we do measure a slight variation with age : stars younger than the median age show @xmath90  km  s@xmath4 , whereas for older stars @xmath91  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "however , this is a very small variation , and may be affected by biases . on one hand ,",
    "older pms stars are fainter and thus affected by larger errors ; small systematics in the estimate of the errors in @xmath1 may therefore be responsible for the detected difference .",
    "also , as shown in @xcite , at fainter luminosities contamination from background sources increases . even though we restricted our analysis to known or probable members , these membership estimates are heterogenous and based on methods with a range of reliabilities in excluding false candidates .    returning to the l1641 region south of the onc , figure [ figure : dec_dispersion ] showed a stellar velocity dispersion in the range @xmath92@xmath79  km  s@xmath4 , i.e. , not very dissimilar from that of the onc . here , however , the total density is much lower than that in the onc , so that the stellar population should not be bound by its own mass . the average stellar density at declinations @xmath93 is @xmath94  pc@xmath95 .",
    "assuming a depth of the population along the line of sight comparable to the width of the filament in the plane of the sky ( @xmath96 or 10  pc ) , this results in a stellar number volume density of @xmath97  pc@xmath83 or @xmath98  pc@xmath83 .",
    "this is more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than in the onc , where @xmath99  pc@xmath83 within @xmath100 .    as for the gas density",
    ", we adopt the extinction map from @xcite ; within the orion a southern filament ( @xmath93 ) the mean extinction is @xmath101  mag .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this corresponds to a mass column density of @xmath102  pc , which again , assuming a depth of the filament of @xmath94  pc results in a volume density of molecular material @xmath103  pc@xmath83 .",
    "we compare these estimates with the condition for virial equilibrium of a filamentary structure from @xcite , i.e. , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the mass per unit of length . considering a width of the l1641 filament of @xmath106  pc , we obtain a typical @xmath107pc@xmath4 , resulting in @xmath108  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this is much smaller than our measured @xmath5 .",
    "we perform a more rigorous analysis of these quantities in different positions of the filament .",
    "this is shown in figure [ figure : sigma_vir_filament ] , where the displayed quantities , as a function of declination , have been computed within moving strips of 1  pc in width in the plane of the sky perpendicular to the filament .",
    "the width of the filament has been measured imposing lateral boundaries where the extinction drops to @xmath109  mag according to the map of @xcite . for the stellar masses at each position we adopted the values derived in paper iv ; for guidance",
    "we also include the results doubling the stellar masses , as an extreme case to account for residual incompleteness in our in - sync sample .",
    "this is largely irrelevant , as the total mass is gas - dominated .",
    "the value @xmath110  km  s@xmath4 is roughly constant along the filament , and 2 - 4 times smaller than the measured @xmath111 , corrected for local gradients , as already shown in figure [ figure : dec_dispersion ] .",
    "this would indicate that the stellar population of the orion a filament south of the onc is dynamically unbound .    assuming the present @xmath112 , the crossing time @xmath113 is in the range 2 - 4  myr , somewhat lower than the age of the system .",
    "this may not be inconsistent with the fact that the young population remains fairly well spatially associated with the molecular material . as we emphasized above , however",
    ", our poor knowledge of the distribution of material , and in particular molecular gas , along the line of sight may affect our estimate for the virial equilibrium velocity predicted for l1641 .",
    "still , the large difference between observed velocities and virial ones would require a seemingly unlikely large error in our estimated densities ( or local mass per unit lengths ) to rule out an unbound nature for the system at the present time .    a puzzling aspect , however , is the fact that the velocity dispersion of the molecular material , traced by the @xmath15co , is on the other hand in fairly good agreement with the predicted virial velocity .",
    "it is not clear , therefore , how the stellar component would have gained such a higher kinetic energy .",
    "first , the relatively high dynamical time in the region grants that the stellar population is dynamically young , thus stellar interactions and binary star evolution are nor responsible for the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "also , the l1641 region is deficient of massive stars @xcite , thus a rapid removal of gas from stellar feedback should be ruled out . @xcite",
    "recently proposed a model that aims to explain how velocities of young stars can larger than that of dense gas .",
    "they noted that young , but already - formed , stars in orion a appear more spread out than forming protostars both in the plane of the sky , as well as in their radial velocities ( based on in - sync data ) .",
    "the protostars are spatially and kinematically associated to the filaments of molecular gas .",
    "they suggested that magnetically induced tangential oscillation of the filament may be taking place . in this scenario ,",
    "stars are formed coupled with the dense gas , and then gently ejected as the molecular material oscillates back to its original position .",
    "however , it is difficult to see how this scenario could lead to observed line of sight velocity dispersions of the @xmath15co traced dense gas that are consistently much smaller than those of the ejected stars along the entire filament .",
    "we have continued our analysis of the in - sync orion survey , a high - resolution near infrared spectroscopic survey of about 2700 stars in the orion a star forming region , obtained with the sdss apogee spectrograph .",
    "it covers @xmath114 in the plane of the sky , or @xmath13  pc , thus covering the entire cloud from ngc  1977 , the onc , l1641n down to l1641s .",
    "we cover a mass range from @xmath115 to a few solar masses and extinctions up to about @xmath116  mag . in the previous paper of this series ( paper iv ) we presented the derived stellar parameters , studied the",
    "age and age spread of the system , the reddening law , and assigned new membership estimates for sources without a previous membership confirmation .",
    "* we find that young stars have average radial velocities that are very similar to those of the molecular gas throughout the region as traced by co , following a @xmath94  km  s@xmath4 variation from north to south , with the northern region redshifted and the southern region blueshifted .",
    "* in the central part of the cloud , corresponding to l1641n , stars appear slightly blueshifted with respect to the gas . in this region",
    ", however , stars are older and affected by little extinction , suggesting that the molecular gas is located behind the population along the line of sight , and receding with respect to the stars .",
    "* in the region of l1641n the distribution of radial velocities @xmath1 appears asymmetric , with a broader blue - shifted tail . we interpret this as a possible superposition of stellar substructures along the line of sight in relative motion with each other .",
    "* we find the presence of spatial and kinematic substructures in the young population throughout the region , as statistically significant overdensities in position - position - velocity space .",
    "these may indicate groupings of stars that have preserved the turbulent motions of their natal gas . in the l1641n region , these structures show the largest relative offsets in radial velocity , corroborating the possibility of a highly structured stellar distribution along the line of sight .",
    "the onc , on the other hand , does not present significant kinematic substructure , in agreement with previous findings for this system to have undergone some degree of dynamical evolution , expecting to lead to phase mixing of stellar orbits .",
    "* we find indications that the onc may be currently expanding , from the correlation between radial velocities and @xmath21 , with the low - extinction end of the population , closer to the observer along the line of sight , blueshifted , and viceversa . * in the onc , we measure a velocity dispersion @xmath117  km  s@xmath4 , in agreement with previous findings in the region based on radial velocities or proper motions . by comparing this measurement with estimates of the total mass in the system , we find that the onc may be moderately supervirial , with @xmath7 , i.e. , close to the limit of being unbound . however , our lack of knowledge on the depth of the system along the line of sight  thus the conversion between column and volume densities  remains a main source of uncertainty .",
    "* the rest of the filament south of the onc shows a comparable @xmath5 in the range 1.52.5  km  s@xmath4 . considering the much lower density of stars and gas ( a few @xmath89  pc@xmath83 ) compared to the onc ,",
    "this is a few times higher than the velocity dispersion required for ( filamentary ) virial equilibrium ( @xmath118  km  s@xmath4 ) , suggesting that the stellar population of l1641 is unbound and destined to escape the region .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the molecular gas in this region , however , is compatible with the predicted virial velocities .",
    "thus the origin of large stellar velocities in this region , considering its dynamical youth and absence of massive stars , remains unclear .",
