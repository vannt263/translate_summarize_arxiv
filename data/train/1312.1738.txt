    "quantum information processing ( qip ) with neutral atoms has a number of distinct and appealing advantages , such as scalability , massive parallelism , long coherence times and reliance on well - established experimental techniques .",
    "historically , the dominant fraction of qip schemes with neutral atoms has focused on alkali - metal atoms , which possess a single valence electron outside a tightly - bound atomic core .",
    "the most successful experimental demonstration  @xcite of quantum two - qubit logic gate with neutral atoms has been carried out using rydberg gates , originally proposed in ref .",
    "these experiments employed rydberg excitations of @xmath6rb , an alkali - metal atom . in recent years , there have been important new developments with cooling and trapping divalent atoms , such as group - ii atoms ( _ e.g. _ , mg , ca , sr ) and group - ii - like atoms such as yb , hg , cd , and zn , which can greatly benefit experiments . considering the experimental success of rydberg gates with alkali - metal atoms ,",
    "it is natural to ask if the distinct properties of divalent atoms could improve the experimental feasibility  @xcite .",
    "optical trapping is essential for qip experiments due to long coherence times that can be achieved . in qip experiments ,",
    "the size of rydberg atoms can easily be larger than the lattice constant of the optical lattice . as we recently demonstrated in  @xcite , one - dimensional trapping potential for an alkali - metal rydberg atom",
    "is proportional to the expectation value @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wavenumber of the optical lattice laser whose wavevector is aligned with @xmath9-axis . here",
    "@xmath10 is the lattice laser wavelength , @xmath11 is frequency and @xmath12 is the speed of light .",
    "we have termed @xmath13  landscaping polarizability \" as it modulates the free - electron polarizability @xmath14 according to the intensity profile of the optical lattice .",
    "the factor @xmath7 has a universal dependence on @xmath15 and in the short wavelength @xmath16 ( or high principal quantum number @xmath1 ) limit , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in this limit ,",
    "the rydberg atom is no longer trapped as the optical trapping potential is directly proportional to the landscaping polarizability .",
    "divalent rydberg atoms can still remain trapped even in this limit .    indeed , the divalent atoms have the advantage of a second optically active valence electron , which contributes to the total polarizability , making it easier to trap the atoms in a tight optical lattice . optical trapping of rydberg atoms also faces challenges associated with the small polarizability of rydberg states . in this sense ,",
    "utilization of divalent atoms can greatly simplify the trapping of rydberg states because the second ( non - rydberg ) valence electron sizably contributes to the trapping potential , which is proportional to the atomic polarizability . due to the resonant structure of polarizability contributed by the non - rydberg valence electron",
    ", the lattice wavelength can be also tuned so as to make the total trapping potential large  @xcite .",
    "qip with neutral trapped atoms comes at a price : trapping optical fields strongly perturbs atomic energy levels such that there are uncontrollable accumulations of differential phase between qubit states as atoms move in the traps  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the underlying stark shift is proportional to the local intensity of the trapping lasers ; the shift is non - uniform across the atomic ensemble and it is also sensitive to laser intensity fluctuations .",
    "this problem is elegantly mitigated using the so - called  magic \" traps  @xcite . at the  magic \" trapping conditions , two atomic levels of interest",
    "are shifted by exactly same amount by the trapping fields ; therefore the differential effect of trapping fields simply vanishes for that qubit transition .",
    "the idea of such `` magic '' trapping has also been crucial for establishing a new class of atomic clocks : the optical lattice clocks  @xcite .",
    "when we go back to neutral alkali - metal atoms and review the literature , we easily find a large body of work on optical trapping and utilization of rydberg states in quantum information experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is different for divalent atoms and the ideas on involving them in experiments are in their infancy . to our knowledge",
    ", two papers so far have considered divalent systems in this setting .",

    "@xcite considered the possibility of studying many - body physics using alkaline - earth atoms trapped in optical lattices .",
    "they found magic wavelengths for simultaneously trapping @xmath19(@xmath2 ) rydberg states with the @xmath20 ground state for the sr atom . in their treatment , the polarizability in the rydberg state is evaluated by adding the polarizability of the sr@xmath21 ion to the free electron polarizability , representing the contribution from the rydberg electron .",
    "this treatment neglects averaging of laser intensity profile over the rydberg wavefunction .",
    "also in ref .",
    "@xcite , the splitting into core ( sr@xmath21 ) and rydberg polarizabilities has been carried out in an _ ad hoc _ manner .",
    "our rigorous derivation presents below shows that indeed for the @xmath19(@xmath2 ) states , the total polarizability splits into independent contributions from the valence and the rydberg electrons .",
    "we will show in this paper that the situation is more complicated in the more general case , and even in the independent - particle approximation , the extent to which the rydberg electron can contribute to the total polarizability is dictated by the angular momentum @xmath22 of the entire atom .",
    "furthermore , in a recent paper  @xcite , we demonstrated that the free - electron polarizability of the rydberg electron is modulated by the intensity distribution in an optical lattice , and it is this  intensity landscape modulated polarizability \" that plays a role in trapping the rydberg state .",
    "it can have both positive and negative values and , in contrast to the treatment of ref .",
