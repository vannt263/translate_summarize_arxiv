    "in the last few years the discovery of several new heavy hadrons containing charm quarks has renewed the interest in heavy quark spectroscopy . in 2003 a new resonance named @xmath2 was reported by the belle collaboration in the invariant mass distribution of @xmath3 mesons produced in @xmath4 decays .",

    "the relevant quantity is @xmath235 , defined as the energy difference between the mass of the four - quark system and that of the lowest corresponding threshold , @xmath236 here , @xmath237 stands for the four - quark energy and @xmath238 for the energy of the corresponding threshold . using this definition",
    ", @xmath239 will indicate that all fall  apart strong decays are forbidden , i.e. , one has a proper bound state . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath240 will indicate that the four - quark solution corresponds to an unbound threshold ( two free mesons ) state .",
    "one of the main difficulties in studying four - quark states was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , the slow convergence to the asymptotic two free mesons unbound states .",
    "this makes the identification of threshold states a cumbersome task , demanding large values of @xmath122 . in ref . @xcite it was proposed that this problem could be overcome by means of an extrapolation of the four - quark energy using the expression @xmath241 where @xmath242 , @xmath243 and @xmath244 are fitted parameters .    although the study of the energy is the most powerful way to distinguish between bound and unbound four - quark states we have taken a step further analyzing in detail the structure of the wave function . in particular , it is possible to determine if a four - quark system behaves as a pure meson - meson state or if it has a more involved structure through the analysis of the dominant components of the wave function .",
    "any solution of the four - quark problem that could be identified with a threshold should verify not only that @xmath2450 but also that the probability of the threshold within the four - quark wave function should be unity .",
    "one can also study the behavior of the root mean square radius ( rms ) of the four - quark system as compared to the radii of the two - mesons threshold .",
    "the rms is defined in the usual way for four ( two ) quark systems @xmath246 combining all this information it could be claimed that any four - quark state with the following characteristics : ( i ) @xmath247 with @xmath122 ; ( ii ) @xmath248 with @xmath122 , ( its value should at least exceed the value corresponding to the threshold system ) ; ( iii ) the wave - function tends to a single singlet - singlet physical channel ; should be considered as an unbound threshold state .",
    "we present in table [ tc1 ] the results obtained for all possible @xmath228 isoscalar channels with both quark models , cqc and bcn .",
    "we indicate the maximum value of @xmath122 used , @xmath234 .",
    "we also indicate the probability of the basis vector corresponding to the lowest physical threshold .",
    "let us first of all concentrate on the results of the two quark models used , we will comment later on the comparison with the experimental data .",
    "there is a first general conclusion immediately derived looking at this table , namely that no bound state is observed for any set of quantum numbers in any of the models , in all cases @xmath249 .",
    "let us analyze the results in detail .",
    "the convergence of the results is illustrated in table [ tc3 ] , where we show the evolution of the energy , radius and probabilities as a function of @xmath122 for two different channels with both quark models .",
    "we have denoted by @xmath250 the probability of the basis vector with color state @xmath251 and spin @xmath252 in the @xmath253 coupling . for each model , we compare in the bottom part of the table with the lowest energy threshold and its rms ( the sum of the rms s of the two mesons ) .",
    "one can see how the four - quark energies do converge to the lowest possible threshold at the same time that the radius increases linearly and the probability of the vector that characterizes the threshold tends to unity .",
    "when the extrapolation ( [ extra ] ) is used , we observe how the four - quark energies reproduce those of the lowest threshold allowed for each set of quantum numbers .",
    "this is illustrated in table [ tc4 ] , where we indicate @xmath242 as a function of the initial and final values of @xmath122 used for the fitting .",
    "the thresholds are perfectly reproduced within a difference , due to the extrapolation , of a few mev .",
    "these are general features for all the states in table [ tc1 ] .",
    "let us emphasize the importance of comparing the four - quark energies with the proper mathematical threshold , if this is not done it could easily lead to the misidentification of bound states .",
    "this is made evident on the last columns of table [ tc1 ] , where we have quoted the experimental thresholds .",
    "looking at column @xmath235 under the epigraph exp .",
    ", one can see the abundance of _ spurious _ bound states predicted by the bcn model ( five ) if the experimental thresholds are considered instead the correct , theoretical , ones .",
    "special attention must also be paid to some numerical approximations used for solving the four - quark problem . in the numerical procedure described in section [ tech ]",
    "one can easily restrict the method to perform a calculation considering only a limited set of relative angular momenta between the quarks .",
    "we show in table [ tlmax ] the results obtained neglecting large relative orbital angular momenta ( @xmath254 ) for two different set of quantum numbers .",
    "as can be seen , this approximation is excellent for those states whose solution can be expressed exclusively in terms of @xmath255 and @xmath256 mesons ( the @xmath106 are the relative angular momenta associated to the jacobi coordinates in the coupling @xmath253 ) , as it is the case of @xmath225 , while it fails for those states with a more involved structure . since one does not know a priori the behavior of a particular channel it is inadvisable to perform such an approximation and therefore , a full calculation is required for any global analysis of four - quark states . a similar effect related with the restriction of the hilbert space",
    "can also be observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an analysis of the four - quark problem was performed with a variational solution of the bcn model in a harmonic oscillator basis up to @xmath257 , obtaining 3409 and 3468 mev for the @xmath258 and @xmath43 states , respectively . being the hyperspherical harmonic basis for @xmath259 roughly equivalent to the @xmath257 harmonic oscillator basis , we have obtained 3380 and 3436 mev , respectively , for these states when we restrict ourselves to @xmath259",
    ". however , once we allow @xmath122 to take larger values , the energy decreases more than 200 mev until the lowest threshold for each channel is obtained .    among all channels presented in table [ tc1 ] ,",
    "three of them deserve a careful analysis : @xmath260 for cqc , and @xmath261 for cqc and bcn .",
    "their energies , probabilities , and radius are resumed in tables [ taux1 ] and [ taux2 ] as a function of @xmath122 .",
    "we observe that they have a dominant octet ",
    "octet color component that could be interpreted as evidence of a compact four  quark system .",
    "however , since the lowest threshold in all three cases corresponds to a @xmath18 or @xmath262 state , the coupling where the numerical calculation is done , @xmath253 , is not the most appropriate one to identify threshold solutions .",
    "once the states are re - expressed in the proper basis , @xmath224 , it can be easily observed how they converge to the lowest available threshold as nicely as the other sets of quantum numbers .    from the discussion above it is clear that no bound state exist either for cqc or for bcn .",
    "let us now address the question if it is possible to generate a bound state by means of reasonable assumptions in the interacting hamiltonian , i.e. , would a different thoughtful two - body quark - quark interaction be able to generate a bound state ?",
    "the answer is that it does not seem to be possible .",
    "the reason for that is simple , whenever one modifies the interacting potential , not only the four - quark energy but also the two - body energy is affected .",
    "this has been illustrated in table [ tevol ] for two particular cases , @xmath263 @xmath258 cqc , and @xmath260 bcn . in both cases",
    "the relative strength of the interactions has been tailored in such a way that the lowest threshold is modified in a significant quantum number ( spin , color , ... ) . in particular , we have fine tuned the one - gluon exchange interaction by means of the regularization parameter @xmath264 to modify the threshold from @xmath265 to @xmath266 ( table [ tevol ] upper part ) and from @xmath267 to @xmath268 ( table [ tevol ] lower part ) . in both cases",
    "we show the values of energies , radius and the relevant probabilities for some values of @xmath122 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the alternative sets of parameters do converge to the new lowest threshold .",
    "this behavior makes evident the main difference between @xmath222 and @xmath269 systems .",
    "for the later there is a consensus that there would be stable channels against dissociation into two mesons if the ratio of the mass of the heavy to the light quark is large enough @xcite .",
    "one should notice that for these states no other combination than a @xmath227 two - meson system is allowed for the threshold and therefore , any modification in the interaction between the two - charm quarks or the two - light antiquarks , for instance the ratio of the masses , would not translate into a modification of the energy of the threshold @xcite .",
    "once it has been observed that no bound state can be obtained by means of any thoughtful two - body potential , one should reformulate the question we made at the beginning of this section into , is it possible that @xmath0 bound states naturally exist _ or other restrictions must be imposed to bind them _ ?",
    "two main possibilities have been discussed in the literature in order to force four - quark states to be bound . on the one hand three- and four - quark interactions that would not be factorizable as a sum of two - body potentials",
    "could be included in the four - quark hamiltonian . among these interactions ,",
    "three alternatives have been thoroughly discussed : color three- and four - quark interactions depending on the color @xmath193 quadratic and cubic casimir operators @xcite , flip - flop confining interactions @xcite , and string model approaches @xcite . on the other hand",
    "one could choose to directly restrict the hilbert space in the few - body problem , selecting a priori those components that may favor the binding of the system , the so - called diquarks @xcite .",
    "a diquark ( antidiquark ) is an @xmath34wave bound state of two quarks ( antiquarks ) with particular quantum numbers , i.e. , antisymmetric in color , flavor , and spin .",
    "this has been explored in recent years not only for four - quark systems , but also for three- and five - quark states @xcite .",
    "technically , the effect of both hypothesis is the same , migrating probability from the color singlet - singlet components to the octet - octet ones .",
    "this makes that the two asymptotically free mesons are no longer a solution of the four - quark hamiltonian and therefore the interaction can be tailored to create a compact four - quark bound state .",
    "let us finally notice that when this work was finished ref .",
    "@xcite has analyzed the stability of @xmath270 and @xmath271 systems in a simple string model considering only a multiquark confining interaction giving by the minimum of a flip - flop or a butterfly potential .",
    "the ground state of systems made of two quarks and two antiquaks of equal masses was found to be below the dissociation threshold . while for the flavor exotic @xmath270 the binding increased when",
    "increasing the mass ratio @xmath272 , for the cryptoexotic @xmath273 the effect of symmetry breaking is opposite , the system being unbound whenever @xmath274 .",
    "altough more realistic calculations are needed before establishing a definitive conclusion , the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite strengtened our result about the doubtful existence of @xmath0 compact states .",
    "since the @xmath2 was first reported by belle in 2003 @xcite it has gradually become the flagship of a new group of states whose properties make their identification as traditional @xmath57 states unlikely . in this heterogeneous group",
    "we could include states like the @xmath276 reported by babar , and the @xmath277 and @xmath48 reported by babar and cleo .",
    "all these states deserve full discussions on their own , however in this section we are going to focus only on the properties of the aforementioned @xmath2 .",
    "an average mass of 3871.2@xmath50.5 mev and a narrow width of less than 2.3 mev have been reported for the @xmath2 .",
    "note the vicinity of this state to the @xmath278 threshold , @xmath279 mev @xcite ( @xmath280 mev according to the last measurement by cleo @xcite ) .",
    "with respect to the @xmath2 quantum numbers , neither d0 nor babar have been able to offer a clear prediction about its @xmath1 .",
    "the isovector nature of this state has been excluded by babar due to the negative results in the search for a charged partner in the decay @xmath281 , @xmath282 @xcite .",
    "cdf has performed a determination of @xmath1 of the @xmath2 using dipion invariant mass distribution and angular analysis , obtaining that only the assignments @xmath45 and @xmath275 are able to describe data @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recent studies by belle combining angular and kinematic properties of the @xmath283 invariant mass , strongly favor a @xmath225 state @xcite , and the observation of the @xmath284 also prefers the @xmath45 assignment compared to the @xmath275 @xcite .",
    "therefore , although some caution is still required until better statistic is obtained @xcite , an isoscalar @xmath225 state seems to be the best candidate to describe the properties of the @xmath2 .",
    "all these properties have triggered intense theoretical speculations about the nature of this state . among the possible structures that have been explored one can find tetraquarks , cusps , hybrids , glueballs , and molecular states ,",
    "although in most cases these works have been devoted to the study of a limited set of quantum numbers in an attempt to determine the viability of describing its energy together with its width and decay modes @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]    although our main conclusion also applies for these quantum numbers , i.e. , the non - existence of four - quark bound states , we summarize in detail in this section the results obtained for the isoscalars @xmath45 and @xmath275 ( table [ tx1 ] ) four - quark states . in this case",
    "we illustrate the convergence plotting the energies as a function of @xmath122 in fig .",
    "it can be observed how the bcn @xmath45 state does not converge to the lowest threshold for small values of @xmath122 , being affected by the presence of an intermediate @xmath265 threshold with an energy of 3874 mev .",
    "once sufficiently large values of @xmath122 are considered the system follows the usual convergence to the lowest threshold ( see insert in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this behavior can also be observed in the wave function probabilities ( right hand side of table [ tx1 ] ) .",
    "this is the only case where this happens and can be traced back to the unique nature of the intermediate threshold , two @xmath34wave mesons in a relative @xmath34wave .",
    "values of @xmath122 sufficiently large would generate the correct solution .",
    "once all possible quantum numbers of the @xmath2 have been analyzed and discarded very few alternatives remain .",
    "if this state is experimentally proved to be a compact four - quark state this will point either to the existence of non two - body forces or to the emergence of strongly bound diquark structures within the tetraquark .",
    "both possibilities are appealing , does the interaction becomes more involved with the number of quark or does the hilbert space becomes simpler ? on the one hand , some lattice qcd collaborations @xcite have reported the important role played by three- and four - quark interactions within the confinement ( the @xmath285 and @xmath286shape ) .",
    "on the other hand , diquark correlations have been proposed to play a relevant role in several aspects of qcd , from baryon spectroscopy to scaling violation @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous formation of diquark components can be checked within our formalism .",
    "the four - quark state can be explicitly written in the @xmath287 coupling in order to isolate the diquark - antidiquark configurations .",
    "in the particular case of the @xmath288 @xmath225 of all possible components of the wave function only two of them have the proper quantum numbers to be identified with a diquark , being the total diquark probability less than 3% .",
    "therefore , it is clear that without any further hypothesis two - body potentials do not favor the presence of diquarks and any description of these states in terms of diquark - antidiquark components would be selecting a restricted hilbert space .",
    "in this work we present for the first time a generalization of the hyperspherical harmonic formalism to study systems made of quarks and antiquarks of different flavor . we have focused our analysis on hidden - charm systems , namely states containing charm quarks and antiquarks with charm quantum number equal to zero .",
    "this formalism opens the door to an exact study of several other multiquark systems containing quarks with different masses and/or flavors , like the @xmath289 or the @xmath290 , up to now sparsely analyzed in the literature .",
    "we have performed a systematic analysis of all @xmath0 isoscalar ground states .",
    "this includes positive parity @xmath37 and negative parity @xmath229 systems with @xmath2910,1 , and 2 .",
    "we have used two standard quark models in the literature , both leading to the same conclusions .",
    "the relevance of a careful analysis of the numerical thresholds together with the numerical approximations involved has been emphasized in order to avoid misidentification of bound states .",
    "we have not found any compact four  quark bound state for any set of quantum numbers .",
    "we have studied the possibility of generating a bound state by means of a modification of the interacting hamiltonian .",
    "we conclude that no refitting of the models would be able to force a bound state if only two - body color - dependent forces are considered .",
    "the reason has been traced back to the particular singlet - singlet decomposition available to the @xmath0 states , namely , the possibility of constructing @xmath292 or @xmath293 two - meson states in such a way that any modification of the two - body potential in the four - quark problem is automatically translated into the two - meson final state . concerning the @xmath2 we have explicitly discussed the quantum numbers favored by experiment , @xmath45 and @xmath275 , obtaining that none of them is bound .",
    "it has been said that when you have eliminated the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth @xcite .",
    "therefore , the non - existence of bound @xmath0 states together with the experimental observation of suggested non-@xmath57 states like the @xmath2 , seems to be clearly emphasizing the need of considering new structures not based in naive two - body interactions , like for example diquarks configurations or few - body potentials , in order to improve our understanding of the hadron spectra .",
