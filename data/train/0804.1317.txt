    "the partial differential equations ( pdes ) that governs conserved and non - conserved scalar coarsening systems are the cahn - hilliard ( ch ) @xcite and allen - cahn ( ac ) equations @xcite respectively .",
    "examples are found in polymer mixtures @xcite , alloys @xcite , liquid - crystals @xcite , and in cosmology @xcite .",
    "these equations , as well as their various extended forms , are an active area of research .",
    "they model the phase separation that occurs after a quench from a high temperature disordered phase into two distinct phases at low temperatures .",
    "the pattern of the two phase regions coarsens as the time increases , i.e. , the length - scale of these regions grows .",
    "the scaled correlation is an important probe to characterize the late time scaling regime , where the dynamics are dominated by a single length scale , the average domain size @xmath2 , which increases with a power law in time @xmath0 , @xmath3 @xcite . for the scalar order parameter systems considered in this paper ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 for conserved and and non - conserved systems , respectively @xcite . to study the coarsening systems",
    ", one needs to choose a random initial condition , which corresponds to a high temperature disordered phase .",
    "since it is essentially not possible to find an exact solution for random initial conditions , computer simulation plays an important role in understanding these systems .    because of the nature of slow coarsening process in the late time scaling regime , the main challenge in computer simulation of coarsening systems is to develop an efficient algorithm .",
    "the most straightforward approach is the euler algorithm , which must employ a time step @xmath6 and @xmath7 to maintain stability for conserved and non - conserved systems , respectively , where @xmath8 is the lattice spacing . on the other hand , one has to use a lattice spacing @xmath9 to resolve the interfacial profile , where @xmath10 is the interfacial width .",
    "this implies that the euler update is inefficient , and in practice computationally costly to use to evolve large systems until the late time scaling regime .",
    "various computational algorithms have been developed by increasing the algorithmic time step @xmath11 compared to the simplest euler discretization .",
    "for example , the cell dynamical system ( cds ) @xcite was broadly applied @xcite as an efficient technique . however , a transformation of cds to pde @xcite showed that cds changes the form of the equation of motion within the same universality class and gets a less strict stability threshold for its euler update , but the euler time step is still limited to @xmath12 and @xmath7 for conserved and non - conserved systems , respectively .",
    "more recently , conditionally stable algorithms such as fourier spectral methods @xcite have been developed by introducing implicit terms in the update equation , and have been shown to allow an increase of the algorithmic time step @xmath11 by two orders of magnitude . however",
    ", none of these methods can adjust to the naturally slowing dynamics - they eventually become more and more inefficient at the late time scaling regime .",
    "the recently developed unconditionally stable algorithms @xcite overcomes the difficulty of a fixed time step for maintaining stability and allows for arbitrarily large algorithmic time steps . in ch equation ,",
    "the algorithm allows an optimal driving scheme @xmath13 with the error in correlations scales as @xmath14 for small prefactor @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this implies that any driving scheme that is slower than the optimal one is wastefully accurate because the error is negligible in correlations @xcite .",
    "this algorithm has also been applied to other interesting systems , such as the phase field crystal ( pfc ) model @xcite and the swift - hohenberg ( sh ) equation and showed significantly improved efficiency @xcite .",
    "while we have no doubt about the efficiency of unconditionally stable algorithms , the accuracy of unconditionally stable algorithm , remains somewhat mysterious , and some open questions remain unanswered . for example",
    ", why does the single step error accumulate over time @xcite ?",
    "why does the fitting for the maximal analytic time step in non - conserved system get worse as @xmath16 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tilde - a ] ) for a precise definition ] increases ? in this paper , by explicitly calculating the fourier space multi step error using eq .",
    "( [ eq : multi_step_error ] ) , we are able to answer these questions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the results in the previous work @xcite and introduces the basic concepts and notations of unconditionally stable algorithms . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the fourier space multi step error , where the distinction of the analytic time and the algorithmic time is necessary . based on this result , in section 4",
    ", we determine the accuracy in the scaled structure factor @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we then calculate the analytic time step in section 5 , taking into account the error in @xmath18 .",
    "the summary are presented in section 6 . in the appendix",
    ", we derive the scaling of field derivatives for all modes in fourier space . for simplicity but without loss of generality , we restrict our analysis to two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "for coarsening systems , a suitable free energy functional to describe the ordered phase is @xcite @xmath19=\\int d^2x \\left[\\frac{1}{2 } |\\nabla \\phi|^2 + v(\\phi ) \\right ] ,          \\label{eq : tdglbasic}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the order parameter , and the potential @xmath21 has a double - well structure @xmath22 .",
