    "in this paper we study continuous - time quantum search on balanced binary trees , on which all leaves have the same distance from the root and where no branches are missing .",
    "our goal is to determine : ( i ) how network heterogeneity influences the performance of the algorithm , and ( ii ) whether there is speedup over the @xmath3 time complexity of classical approaches , where @xmath4 is the total number of sites .",
    "suppose a quantum walker undertakes a blind search on such a tree structure that provides no global information , and where edges leading to descendent sites can not be distinguished from edges leading to parent sites .",
    "the walker is only given an oracle hamiltonian that allows to check whether the searched - for site ( which we will also call the marked site ) has been reached .",
    "then , starting from a uniform initial state , how long does it take to find that site ?",
    "grover s algorithm  @xcite provides a way to perform a discrete - time quantum search in an unstructured space with @xmath5 oracle queries , which is optimal  @xcite .",
    "a continuous - time version with the same running time was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite describes a discrete - time algorithm capable of searching a @xmath6-dimensional periodic lattice in @xmath5 time for @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 . in the continuous - time setting ,",
    "the problem on the lattice is analyzed in ref .",
    "the authors show that : ( i ) we have quadratic speedup @xmath5 for @xmath10 , ( ii ) @xmath8 time is required for @xmath11 , and ( iii ) there is no significant speedup in lower dimensions .",
    "recently , dimensionality reduction methods using symmetries have been formalized  @xcite , and a variety of new structures has been studied  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , quadratic speedup is obtained only after modifying the weights of certain edges of a simplex of complete graphs .",
    "the references mentioned so far examine homogeneous structures in which all sites are equivalent .",
    "the behavior changes significantly if one looks at graphs in which there are qualitatively different sites .",
    "the tree under consideration belongs to this category  for example , the degrees of leaf - sites differ from those in the interior .",
    "quantum search on structures that are less symmetric and more heterogeneous has been explored in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite in the discrete - time and continuous - time setting , respectively . refs .",
    "@xcite investigate the correlation between the efficiency for the search of a certain site and its centrality or connectivity .",
    "more recently , quantum walks on erds - rnyi random graphs  @xcite and on scale - free graphs and hierarchical structures  @xcite have been studied .",
    "it is thus natural to ask how location affects time complexity and how any variation in algorithmic behavior can be tied to site - specific properties , e.g. to its degree or centrality .",
    "such questions regarding location and site - specific properties are particularly pertinent for quantum walks , as these do not converge in the sense of classical diffusion .",
    "instead , they require a more finely - tuned prescription on exactly when to measure the state of the system . in this paper",
    "we will see how these matters influence the time complexity for quantum search on a balanced tree .    whether or not there is speedup on balanced trees is of interest , because there are conflicting intuitive arguments : quantum walks tend to be more effective on high dimensional structures and on structures that have a multitude of paths connecting any given pair of sites .",
    "regarding trees , with exactly one path between any two sites , this suggests poor performance . on the other hand",
    ", it seems possible that a quantum algorithm can take advantage of the very small diameter of the tree .",
    "there are other properties of trees ( such as the exponential spread of volume , the poor transport properties on trees  @xcite , the good transport properties across glued trees  @xcite , etc ) that may influence our expectation .",
    "what efficiency does the combination of all these factors lead to ?",
    "the main result of this work is that the time complexity of the quantum search algorithm on a balanced binary tree depends on the location of the searched - for site .",
    "the root can be found in @xmath12 time , while for finding a leaf there is no speedup and @xmath3 time is needed . in between these two cases , the exponent of the time complexity @xmath0 changes linearly from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . in order to arrive at this conclusion ,",
    "we reduce calculations on the balanced tree to a quasi one - dimensional problem .",
    "we then solve the case when the marked site is the root of the tree analytically , and the other cases we treat numerically for systems large enough ( up to size @xmath13 ) to allow for the identification of the scaling exponent of the running time .",

    "[ sec.setting]-[sec.classical ] , we focus on the case when the marked site is the root in order to be able to carry out a symbolic analysis .",
    "the second part , the generic case of a marked site placed anywhere in the tree , consists of numerical investigations .",
    "we first introduce the setting for our quantum search problem on the tree ( sec .  [ sec.setting ] ) .",
    "next we discuss a technique for reducing the size of a system ( sec .",
    "[ sec.red_gen ] ) , which is then applied to the tree ( sec .",

    "working with the reduced system , we proceed to find the laplace transform of the state at the searched - for site exactly ( sec .",
