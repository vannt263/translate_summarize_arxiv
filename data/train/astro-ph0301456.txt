    "the first detection of an [ ] line in an region is due to @xcite , who measure [ ]  @xmath22836.56 in the uv spectrum of the orion nebula ( ) . from this line and two previous ionization models for orion , @xcitefind @xmath3",
    "lower , by factors of 6.5 and 19 , than the value the models need to reproduce [ ] and [ ] emission in , @xmath4 . according to @xcite , the difference between the results obtained from the two models is due mostly to the different average electron temperatures ( @xmath5 ) predicted by each model . since the two orion models and the measurement of the [ ] line correspond to different regions in the nebula ,",
    "an underlying assumption in the above comparison is that the gaseous fe abundance remains roughly constant within the ionized gas .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite calculates the fe abundances for 12 regions in from the fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath0 abundances and ionization correction factors ( icfs ) for the contribution of fe@xmath1 , obtained from grids of photoionization models .",
    "since the fe@xmath6 abundance is very low for all positions ( @xmath7 ) , the results depend mostly on the derived fe@xmath0 abundances , and these are based on the atomic data leading to the best fit between the observed and predicted relative intensities of the [ ] lines .",
    "the final fe abundances are lower than those derived in previous studies based on older atomic data , and show variations of more than a factor of 2 : @xmath8 . taking this into account , the discrepancy found by @xcite",
    "could be reduced and now gets as close as a factor of @xmath9 , and @xcite argues that given all the uncertainties involved in the calculations , this discrepancy might not be significant .",
    "the main uncertainties arise from the calculation of the fe@xmath1 abundance from one weak uv line , which is very sensitive to @xmath5 and the extinction correction , and from the lack of measurements of [ ] , [ ] , and diagnostic lines at exactly the same position in the nebula .",
    "the measurement of optical [ ] lines would solve this difficulty , but these lines are weak and difficult to observe . since fe@xmath1 is an important or dominant ionization state in most regions , the reality of this underabundance implied by [ ] emission , and the reasons behind it , are critical issues in our understanding of both the evolution of dust in regions ( see * ? ? ? * ) and the chemical evolution at low metallicities ( see * ? ? ? * ) .    this paper presents the identification and analysis of one [ ] line at @xmath10 in the optical spectra of observed by @xcite .",
    "the same line is identified in the spectra of the planetary nebula @xcite .",
    "upper limits to the intensities of [ ]  @xmath11 , 6739.8 are obtained from the spectra of in the lmc observed by @xcite .",
    "another optical [ ] line at @xmath12 , tentatively identified by @xcite in the spectra of the blue compact dwarf galaxy , and the measurement of [ ]  @xmath22836.56 in by @xcite are used to complete a set of data in which to perform an analysis of [ ] emission and the fe abundance in different ionized nebulae .",
    "throughout this paper air wavelengths are used for the optical lines and vacuum wavelengths for the uv ones .",
    "the transitions giving rise to the [ ] lines discussed here are identified in figure  [ f1 ] ( see also table  [ t0 ] ) .",

    "they find a weak feature at @xmath13 which they consider as clearly detected but unidentified .",

    "the wavelength is very close to [ ]  @xmath10 ( @xmath15 ) , the brightest optical [ ] line that can be expected to form at the physical conditions prevailing in .",
    "this line was previously identified in the spectrum of @xcite , one of the most dense and luminous planetary nebulae , which has an extremely rich spectrum . for the orion observations",
    "the agreement in wavelength is very good , especially when accounting for the difference of @xmath16 due to the trend of velocity vs.ionization potential found by @xcite .",
    "the measurements of [ ]  @xmath22836.56 by @xcite and [ ]  @xmath26739.8 by @xcite were performed at different positions in orion , but both positions are at similar distances from the ionizing star ( 32  and 37 , respectively ) , so that it might be instructive to compare their intensities .",
    "the reddening - corrected intensities relative to h@xmath17 of both lines imply @xmath18 , whereas for typical orion physical conditions ( see table  [ t1 ] and  3 below ) the expected value of this ratio is @xmath19 . other optical [ ] lines following @xmath26739.8 in intensity would be @xmath24906.56 ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath26734.4 ( @xmath21 ) , and @xmath26761.3 ( @xmath22 ) , but these lines have expected intensities of about half the @xmath26739.8 intensity and they are at the limit of line detection of @xcite .",
    "we have then a good case for the detection of the first optical [ ] line in .    a literature search for other nebulae in which to perform an analysis of [ ] emission and the fe abundance yielded four suitable objects : , , , and .",
    "available spectra of these objects include one [ ] line , one or more [ ] lines , and the [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] lines needed to derive @xmath5 values and electron density ( @xmath23 ) values , the o abundance , and the degree of ionization @xmath24 . the optical [ ] lines measured by @xcite in and could not be used because the [ ]  @xmath25 lines were outside their observed wavelength range .",
    "other objects , like the symbiotic nova , where several [ ] lines have been detected ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    ", the line is most likely a blend of three [ ] lines in the multiplet : @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , and @xmath39 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "two of the unidentified features measured by @xcite , at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , could also be [ ] lines : @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) . the intensities of these two lines relative to the blend at @xmath38 are consistent with the expected values within a factor of 2 ( see table  [ t0 ] ) .",

    "the abundances presented here are affected by the usual uncertainties related to the method of calculation : ( i ) the assumption that the observed lines originate in one or two emitting layers of constant @xmath23 and @xmath5 , ( ii ) the uncertainties in the atomic data used to derive physical conditions and ionic abundances , ( iii ) errors in the line intensities , and ( iv ) the uncertainties arising from the use of icfs to account for unseen stages of ionization .",
    "the systematic uncertainties arising from any of these causes are very difficult to estimate .",
    "the errors presented here have been calculated by considering only the errors in the line intensities , following the guidelines given by the different authors for each object , but taking 5% as the minimum error for any line intensity relative to h@xmath17 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the errors in the line intensity ratios are just estimates , and that the criteria followed by the different authors may vary .",
    "the errors for each calculated quantity have been derived by adding quadratically the errors in the line intensity ratio used to derive the ionic abundance and the errors arising from the uncertainties in both @xmath5 and @xmath23 .",
    "the last ones are especially important for the o@xmath6 abundance and all ratios involving this ion ( e.g. @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .",

    "this contribution will be neglected in what follows .",
    "the large difference between the relative intensities of the [ ] and lines in and arises from the lower metallicity of the latter ( by a factor @xmath67 in the o abundance , see table  [ t2 ] ) and its associated higher @xmath5 .",

    "an estimate of the fe@xmath71 abundance in was obtained by averaging the values of @xmath72 found in @xcite for three regions in that are 27  south of the position observed by @xcite , but at a similar distance from .",
    "the resulting value , @xmath73 , is just @xmath74% of the abundance derived for fe@xmath0 .",
    "this estimate of the fe@xmath71 abundance in has been used in the analysis described below , which leads to a discrepancy between the expected and measured values of the @xmath51 abundance of a factor @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath76 had been neglected in this analysis , the discrepancy would be lower , a factor @xmath77 .",
    "since the other objects have a higher degree of ionization than , the contribution of @xmath76 to their fe abundance will be neglected .",
    "the effect of neglecting the @xmath76 abundance in the results for these higher ionization objects is likely to be even lower than for , especially for and , where no [ ] lines are detected . in any case , if the concentration of @xmath76 in any of these objects were not negligible , the discrepancy between the expected and calculated values of @xmath51 would be higher than the values given below .    on the other hand , and",

    "since he@xmath6 , o@xmath0 and fe@xmath1 have similar ionization potentials ( 54.4 , 54.9 , and 54.8  ev , respectively ) , the presence of he@xmath0 suggests that o@xmath1 and fe@xmath78 might also be present .",

    "the icf is based on the grids of ionization models of @xcite and @xcite , and is further discussed in @xmath85 below .",
    "the second value for the fe abundance is just the sum of the derived ionic abundances , @xmath86 .",
    "the fe abundances based on the sum of the ionic abundances can be seen to be systematically lower , by factors in the range 2.65.9 , than those implied by the @xmath59 abundance and an icf .",
    "the expected values of the @xmath51 abundance , @xmath87 , can be obtained from the relation @xmath88\\,\\mbox{o}/\\mbox{h}$ ] .",

    "the above comparison between the expected and calculated values of @xmath93 relies on the icf applied to the @xmath59 abundance in order to obtain the total fe abundance . since [ ] lines are the fe lines most easily detected in regions , this icf is a key parameter in the determination of the fe abundance in these nebulae .",
    "the o ions are probably the best choice for defining icfs for the fe ions .",
    "first , because both @xmath69 and @xmath70 can be easily measured from strong optical lines .",

    "these models have @xmath23 of 10 and 1000  @xmath27 , and @xmath113  k. the main difference between the two series is that the results of @xcite are presented for several lines of sight across each model .",
    "the results from the two series of models shown in figure  [ f2 ] can be compared with those of three individual models for : @xmath114=0.26 $ ] @xcite , @xmath114=0.15 $ ] @xcite , and @xmath114=0.04 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the last result has been calculated with the most recent values for the photoionization cross - sections and recombination - rate coefficients for the fe ions @xcite , and is similar to the icf used here .",

    "several comments can be made about figure  [ f2 ] :    1 .",
    "the results for those models of @xcite with solar metallicity deviate from the relation followed by the models with lower metallicities .",
    "this suggests that the icfs might be dependent on metallicity , but the models of @xcite and the results of @xcite for subsolar metallicities do not show such dependence .",
    "2 .   although the results for each series of models are consistent with roughly constant values for @xmath100 $ ] and @xmath101 $ ] , the values are different for each series .",
    "the values of @xmath100 $ ] are substantially higher than those of @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that the models predict a significant concentration of fe@xmath6 , although with great scatter : @xmath116 .",
    "however , the values found in @xcite for galactic regions with @xmath117 for @xmath118 are all lower than 0.3 and mostly around 0.1 .",
    "the concentrations of ions with low ionization potential like fe@xmath6 are very model - dependent and , therefore , difficult to estimate with reliability .",
    "furthermore , as suggested by the referee , this difference between the expected and calculated concentrations of fe@xmath6 can be due to the presence of significant amounts of fe@xmath6 in neutral zones , where the @xmath5 is too low to produce the optical [ ] lines .",
    "therefore , i consider it more reliable to use the icf implied by @xmath101 $ ] , neglecting the contribution of @xmath76 for the high - ionization objects . as discussed above , this should be a good approximation for and , where no [ ] lines are detected .",
    "if the contribution of @xmath76 were higher than assumed , the discrepancy between the expected and calculated values of @xmath51 would be even higher than the values derived here .",
    "the calculated results are in any case systematically below the expected ones .",
    "4 .   according to both series of models , @xmath102\\simeq1 $ ] for @xmath117 , and therefore @xmath119 to within 0.1  dex .",
    "since @xmath51 and @xmath70 are formed at 30.6 and 35.1  ev , and are ionized at 54.8 and 54.9  ev , for those conditions with @xmath120 , most of fe should be present as @xmath51 . therefore , barring large errors in the atomic data used to derive the fe ionization balance , @xmath119 should be a very good approximation for high - ionization objects ; whereas for any degree of ionization it should hold that @xmath121 .",
    "however , as seen in figure  [ f2]c , all the objects show @xmath122 . 5 .",
    "although the error bars for and are almost consistent with the expected results for @xmath101 $ ] and @xmath102 $ ] , the results for the other objects and the fact that all the calculated results deviate in the same direction from the expected ones confirm that there is a significant deviation .",
    "if the atomic data used in the models to derive the ionization balance of fe were in error , the ionization fractions calculated for real objects could be used to obtain an estimate of the actual icfs .",
    "the results in figure  [ f2 ] can be interpreted in such a way .",
    "a weighted least - squares fit to the data in figure  [ f2]a leads to the following icf , + @xmath123\\,=0.78\\ ,      \\bigg(\\frac{\\mbox{o}^+}{\\mbox{o}^{++}}\\bigg)^{0.43},\\ ] ] + for @xmath124 , but the significance of the fit is not large , and other alternatives such as a constant @xmath100\\simeq0.25 $ ] , can not be excluded .    in summary , there is a clear discrepancy between the calculated results and the model predictions .",
    "even though the discrepancy might not be due to errors in the models ( see  5 below ) , there are some problems with the models that would be worth exploring with further calculations .",
    "the icfs selected here are in any case those leading to the lower discrepancies while at the same time being consistent with the model results .",
    "there are three possible explanations for the discrepancy in the fe abundances obtained from [ ] and [ ] : ( i ) that the atomic data for [ ] are unreliable ; ( ii ) that the concentrations for the fe ions predicted by photoionization models are greatly in error ; and ( iii ) that there is some unknown mechanism producing a gradient in the fe abundance within the ionized gas , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the high value of the discrepancy excludes other explanations , like errors in the line intensities , errors in the calculated physical conditions , or errors in the atomic data for [ ] , which seem reliable , as discussed in @xmath125 .",
    "a contribution of fluorescence to [ ] emission can also be ruled out @xcite .",
    "the [ ] emissivities are almost insensitive to the values used for the transition probabilities and depend mainly on the values of the collision strengths .",
    "therefore , to explain the discrepancies between the expected and calculated values for fe@xmath1 ( @xmath89 in table  [ t2 ] ) , the simplest solution would be to lower all the collision strengths by a factor @xmath126 .",
    "the values and errors given in table  [ t2 ] for the discrepancies imply that if the collision strengths were lower by a factor of @xmath127 , the fe@xmath1 abundances would be consistent with the expected values .",
    "on the other hand , there could be a difference between the discrepancies obtained for and ( @xmath128 ) and those for the other objects ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "this difference does not seem to arise from the fact that the @xmath5 implied by the [ ] lines has been used to derive all the ionic abundances in and , whereas @xmath5 [ ] has been used in the other objects for deriving the abundances of the low ionization ions .",
    "an estimate of @xmath5 [ ] in and can be obtained from @xmath5 [ ] and the relation derived by @xcite from the models of @xcite .",
    "if these estimates of @xmath5 [ ] were used in the analysis , the discrepancies for and would decrease , but by only a small amount to 5.1 , 7.1 and 5.4 for  bar ,  sq .",
    "a , and , respectively .",
    "the @xmath51 abundance has been obtained for and from the intensity of the line [ ]  @xmath10 , whereas [ ]  @xmath22836.56 and the [ ] blend at @xmath38 have been used for and respectively .",
    "the upper level of the transition [ ]  @xmath10 , @xmath130 , is mainly populated by collisional excitations from the @xmath131 levels , which are metastable . the levels @xmath132 and @xmath133 , giving rise to the blend at @xmath38 , are populated by collisional excitations from the @xmath131 levels and from the ground state .",
    "the upper level of [ ]  @xmath22836.56 , @xmath134 , is populated by spontaneous emission from the @xmath135 term and by collisional excitations from both the @xmath131 term and the ground state .",
    "the different discrepancies obtained from [ ]  @xmath10 , on the one hand , and [ ]  @xmath22836.56 , @xmath38 , on the other , could then be the effect of errors in the atomic data .",
    "as an example , if the collision strengths involving only the fe@xmath1 ground state were lowered by a factor of 6.5 , the expected and calculated values of the fe@xmath1 abundance would differ by less than @xmath136% .",
    "however , the difference in the discrepancies could be due to other causes .",
    "one possibility would be that the icfs are highly dependent on metallicity ; another , that the difference between the fe abundances in the [ ] and [ ] emitting regions depends on the metallicity or varies from object to object .",
    "if the trend of increasing @xmath100 $ ] with @xmath137 suggested by the calculated data in figure  [ f2 ] were real , the fe ionization fractions predicted by models should be seriously questioned .",
    "the value predicted by models for the relative concentrations of @xmath59 and @xmath51 , @xmath138 , is roughly proportional to the ratio between the total recombination coefficient of fe@xmath1 and the ionization cross - section for fe@xmath0 integrated over the radiation field .",
    "the latter ratio should then be higher by a factor @xmath127 to explain the discrepancy .",
    "the recent calculations of the ionization and recombination cross - sections for fe@xmath0/fe@xmath1 @xcite are significantly different from the previous data .",
    "the new value for the total recombination coefficient for @xmath51 @xcite is a factor of 1.5 higher at @xmath139  k than the previous value by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the old values for the ionization cross - section of @xmath59 @xcite were calculated for energies above 35  ev and , when extrapolated to lower energies , lead to values which are higher than those calculated by @xcite by a factor of 5 near the ionization threshold . however , according to @xcite , this overestimation compensates in part for the contribution of the many resonant structures found by @xcite at low energies .",
    "therefore , the new data finally lead to similar values for the icfs  at least for the orion model of @xcite , as commented in  4 above .",
    "more extensive calculations exploring the effect of the new cross - sections for different degrees of ionization might be valuable .",
    "the effect of charge - exchange reactions , whose rates are highly uncertain @xcite , should also be explored .",
    "such calculations will be the subject of future work .",
    "an error in the calculations of the fe ionization balance would prove to be the simplest explanation for the trend in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "some mechanism leading to the preferential destruction of dust grains in the low ionization zones could also explain such a trend , but this explanation seems rather ad hoc and less likely .    the accurate measurement of the relative intensities of several [ ] lines in various objects where the physical conditions can also be measured with reasonable accuracy would help to distinguish between all these possibilities .",
    "these measurements could be attempted in low metallicity regions .",
    "the high @xmath5 values prevailing in these objects boost the intensities of forbidden lines while the low metallicity reduces the possible contamination with permitted lines , an important issue when trying to measure very weak lines .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] shows the values of the @xmath95 abundance ratio obtained from the fe@xmath0 abundance and an icf ( figs .",
    "[ f3]a and [ f3]b ) and from the fe@xmath0 and fe@xmath1 abundances ( figs .",
    "[ f3]c and [ f3]d ) .",
    "the results are plotted as a function of the o abundance ( figs .",
    "[ f3]a and [ f3]c ) and of the ionization degree @xmath137 ( figs .",
    "[ f3]b and [ f3]d ) .",
    "the solar @xmath95 and @xmath140 abundance ratios are shown in figure  [ f3]a as a dotted circle @xcite . the real value of the @xmath95 abundance in the gas of a given object will be the result of two factors : the intrinsic value of @xmath95 ( in gas and dust ) and the amount of fe depleted in dust grains .",
    "the intrinsic value of @xmath95 in a given object depends on the previous star formation history , but is expected to show less variation from object to object than either @xmath3 or @xmath140 . in stars of our galaxy",
    ", @xmath95 increases with metallicity and is 0.2 to 0.3  dex below solar when @xmath140 is around 1  dex below solar ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "abundance analyses of stars in the magellanic clouds show the same increment but displaced by about @xmath141  dex towards higher values of @xmath95 at a given metallicity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the intrinsic value of @xmath95 in the interstellar medium of the magellanic clouds ( that is , for and ) might then be solar or up to @xmath141  dex above solar .",
    "the intrinsic value of @xmath95 in is not known .",
    "chemical evolution models for another low metallicity dwarf galaxy , , predict values for @xmath95 ranging from @xmath142  dex above solar to about @xmath143  dex below solar ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "this wide range of possible values arises from the uncertainties in both the star formation history and the iron yields due to massive stars , and makes it impossible to draw a conclusion on the most likely value for @xmath95 in . on the other hand ,",
    "good constraints on these two issues could be obtained from the real value of the @xmath95 abundance ratio in and other low metallicity blue compact galaxies . a low amount of dust within the ionized gas of these low metallicity objects",
    "can be inferred from the low or negligible extinction measured for them .",
    "therefore , the higher value of @xmath95 derived for ( the one obtained with [ ] emission and an icf ) favors a near solar value for the intrinsic @xmath95 in the galaxy , whereas the lower @xmath95 implied by [ ] emission favors an intrinsic @xmath95 about @xmath143  dex below solar .    figures  [ f3]b and [ f3]d suggest an explanation for the different depletion factors of the objects in the sample .",
    "if ( the only planetary nebula in the sample ) is excluded , the values of @xmath95 implied by both procedures increase with the degree of ionization .",
    "the same behavior was found in @xcite for galactic regions with near solar metallicity and it was interpreted as due to the release of fe atoms from dust grains by the action of energetic photons .",
    "the same process may be responsible for the low fe depletion factors in and , but the amount of dust destruction and the slope of its dependence on the number of energetic photons depend strongly on which are the real values of @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the solution to the discrepancy found for [ ] emission , has implications for both the chemical evolution of low metallicity galaxies and the evolution of dust in ionized nebulae .",
    "the line [ ]  @xmath10 has been identified in published spectra of and .",
    "upper limits to the intensity of this line and of [ ]  @xmath33 have been established for .",
    "the tentative identification by @xcite of a line at @xmath12 in the spectra of as an [ ] feature has been confirmed .",
    "these data along with the measurement by @xcite of [ ]  @xmath22836.56 in two positions of have been used to perform an analysis of [ ] emission in the five aforementioned nebulae .",
    "the fe abundances obtained from [ ] lines and an icf derived from ionization models , @xmath84\\,\\mbox{o}/\\mbox{h}$ ] , have been compared with those implied by the sum of the relevant ionic states , @xmath144 .",
    "the @xmath3 abundance ratios obtained from the first method are higher than those derived from the second method by factors in the range 2.65.9 .",
    "this result confirms the discrepancy previously found by @xcite in between the fe abundance implied by [ ] and [ ] lines , and that implied by [ ]  @xmath145 .",
    "the @xmath51 abundance is systematically lower than expected for the five objects by factors from 3.2 to 7.5 .",
    "the uncertainties in the derived discrepancy factors are too high to reach a definitive conclusion , but the present analysis offers two hints as to the possible explanation :    1 .",
    "the discrepancies obtained with [ ]  @xmath10 , on the one hand , and [ ]  @xmath145 and the [ ] blend at @xmath38 , on the other , might be different ( see the values of @xmath89 in table  [ t2 ] ) . the measurement of these lines in a single object would help to establish this issue . if confirmed , this result would imply that the collision strengths for @xmath51 are unreliable .",
    "the values of @xmath100 $ ] derived for the objects in the sample might show a trend with the degree of ionization given by @xmath137 ( see fig .  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "since the ionization models predict a constant value for this icf , @xmath100\\simeq1.1 $ ] , a deviation from this constant value that depends on the degree of ionization would suggest that the fe ionization fractions predicted by models are seriously in error .",
    "the measurement of [ ] lines in more objects would help to establish the reality of this trend .",
    "the values of @xmath95 implied by both methods decrease with metallicity , as shown in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "this trend , which should be confirmed for other low metallicity objects , probably reflects an increase of the fe depletion factors in the different objects as their metallicity increases .",
    "the increment of fe atoms in the gas of low metallicity regions could be due to the effect of the harder radiation fields typically found in these objects .",
    "this is suggested by the fact that if the planetary nebula is excluded , the @xmath95 abundance ratios follow and extend to higher degrees of ionization the correlation with the degree of ionization previously found in @xcite for galactic regions in the solar neighborhood",
    ". the deviation of from the relationship could be due to the large uncertainties in the abundances derived for this object or to the specific origin and characteristics of dust grains in planetary nebulae .",
    "although the values of @xmath95 for the other objects follow the correlation with the degree of ionization independently of whether [ ] emission is considered or not , the shape of the correlation depends on which method is used in the abundance determination .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath95 abundance ratio in the low metallicity galaxy , which has important implications for our understanding of chemical evolution , remains uncertain by a factor of 5 .",
    "all these implications emphasize the need for a correct understanding of the reasons behind the [ ] discrepancy .",
