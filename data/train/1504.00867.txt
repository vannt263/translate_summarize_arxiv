    "this accelerated expansion of space redshifts all initial matter , leaving a vacuum state behind .",
    "as first realized by mukhanov and chibisov for cosmological fluctuations @xcite and starobinsky for gravitational waves @xcite , quantum vacuum fluctuations are continuously generated on sub - hubble scales ( wavelength smaller than the hubble radius @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the cosmological expansion rate ) .",
    "as the wavelengths of these fluctuation modes exit the hubble radius , the vacuum oscillations freeze out and the modes get squeezed ( see e.g. @xcite for reviews of the theory of cosmological perturbations ) and become the seeds for the observed inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter and anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) which are now being mapped by cosmological experiments .    at quadratic order , the fluctuations effect the background space - time and matter .",
    "the effects on the inflaton field lead to the _",
    "stochastic inflation _",
    "scenario @xcite which is one of the cornerstones of the _ inflationary multiverse _",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) and has possible implications for an anthropic `` resolution '' of the cosmological constant problem ( see e.g. @xcite for recent reviews on dark energy and the cosmological constant problem ) .",
    "stochastic inflation is based on the effects which the short wavelength cosmological fluctuations impart on the effective background inflaton field when the wavelength of the fluctuation modes cross the hubble radius .",
    "the effects lead to a stochastic source term in the equation of motion for @xmath1 which leads to an equal probability of driving @xmath1 up or down the potential @xmath0 .",
    "note that having @xmath1 moving up its potential does not violate covariant energy conservation since the covariant conservation equations apply only to the sum of background and fluctuations .",
    "note also that stochastic inflation is based on the infinite reservoir of ultraviolet modes which are stretched by the accelerated expansion of space taking place during the period of cosmological inflation .    at quadratic order , cosmological fluctuations and gravitational waves also back - react on the metric . in inflationary cosmology , these effects were first considered in the case of gravitational waves in @xcite , and in the case of cosmological perturbations in @xcite . by the ( almost ) time translation symmetry of the ( almost ) exponentially expanding background , the back - reaction effects of sub - hubble modes is constant in time . on the other hand ,",
    "since inflation builds up an increasing sea of super - hubble modes , the back - reaction effects of these infrared modes grows in time .",
    "it was found @xcite that each long wavelength modes leads to a small decrease in the effective energy density .",
    "note that it is the same infinite reservoir of fluctuation modes which drives stochastic inflation which is responsible for the increasing sea of long wavelength fluctuations modes which can back - react .",
    "thus , in terms of the background energy density , there is a competition between the effects of stochastic inflation which lead ( at least in half of space ) to an increase in the energy density , and those of back - reaction which lead to a decrease .",
    "a natural question is whether back - reaction effects can prevent stochastic inflation from continuing without bounds , and hence prevent eternal inflation .",
    "this is the question we here address in a couple of different scenarios : _ power - law inflation _",
    "starobinsky inflation _",
    "@xcite , and also the phase of exponential expansion taking place between the cycles of the _ cyclic ekpyrotic scenario _ @xcite .",
    "we find that back - reaction effects are unable to prevent eternal inflation for power - law and starobinsky inflation , but that they dominate over stochastic effects in the cyclic ekpyrotic scenario .",
    "the reason that back - reaction effects dominate in the cyclic ekpyrotic scenario is that the fluctuations which are exiting the hubble radius during the accelerating phase are not in their vacuum state but have already been highly squeezed during the phase of contraction . in the following , we first summarize the basis of stochastic inflation , followed by a review of back - reaction effects of super - hubble cosmological perturbations . we establish firstly the criterion on values of @xmath1 for which stochastic effects dominate over the classical rolling of @xmath1 , and secondly the criterion for back - reaction effects to dominate over the stochastic terms . in sections 4 - 6 we apply these conditions in turn to power - law inflation , starobinsky inflation , and to the phase of accelerated expansion ( the `` dark energy phase '' ) of the cyclic ekpyrotic scenario .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results and some discussions .",
    "let us begin with a brief review of stochastic inflation @xcite . to put the discussion into context ,",
    "consider the space - time sketch of inflationary cosmology shown in fig . 1 . here",
    ", the horizontal axis gives the physical distance and the vertical axis is physical time @xmath4 .",
    "the inflationary phase lasts from initial time @xmath5 until the final time @xmath6 , the time of _ reheating_. the solid curve which is ( almost ) vertical in the inflationary phase denotes the hubble radius .",
    "the dotted curves show the wavelengths of various fluctuation modes which exit the hubble radius during inflation .     until @xmath6 , and it is during this period that the fluctuations we consider here exit the hubble radius . ]    the formalism of stochastic inflationary dynamics describes the effect of modes exiting the hubble radius on the evolution of the effective background field which is the full field coarse grained over the hubble volume ( see e.g. @xcite for a modern view on the formalism of stochastic inflation ) . in slight abuse of notation",
    "we will also denote the effective background field ( and not just the full field ) by @xmath1 .",
    "taking into account the effects of modes crossing the hubble radius which are now entering the sea of long wavelength modes , the equation of motion for @xmath1 becomes [ eom ] + 3 h + v^ ( ) = h^3 ( t ) , which assumes that @xmath7 is approximately constant and where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath1 , and where @xmath8 is a gaussian random variable with unit variance which takes on different values in different hubble patches .",
    "if @xmath8 is positive , then the source term in ( [ eom ] ) will drive @xmath1 up the potential , but if @xmath8 is negative , then the stochastic source will reinforce the classical force driving @xmath1 down its potential .    the _ stochastic region _ of field space is defined to be the one for which the classical force term ( the right hand side of ( [ eom ] ) exceeds the classical force in magnitude , i.e. [ stochcond ] h^3 |v^()| . for example , for the simplest chaotic inflation model with potential v ( ) = m^2 ^2 the condition ( [ stochcond ] ) becomes [ stochcond1 ] || 6 ^ 1/4 ( ) ^1/2 , where @xmath9 is the reduced planck mass defined in terms of newton s constant @xmath10 via @xmath11 .",
    "note that for the normalization of the mass @xmath12 which is consistent with the observed amplitude of cmb anisotropies , the stochastic region of field space is far beyond the field values which influence the period of inflation which is observationally accessible to us .",
    "they do , however , correspond to energy densities which are still much lower than planck densities .",
    "in early universe cosmology we usually consider a homogenous and isotropic background space - time and superimpose small amplitude cosmological fluctuations which are treated by linearizing the field equations about the background .",
    "the einstein field equations , however , are highly nonlinear , and hence even at the classical level the fluctuations at second order influence the background .",
    "this is what we mean by _ back - reaction_.    the expansion parameter for cosmological perturbation theory is the amplitude of the fluctuations which is set by the size of the observed cmb anisotropies and is of the order @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the back - reaction effect of any given fluctuation mode is tiny ( of the order @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , each fluctuation mode effects the background , and hence , for a long period of inflation the integrated effect of all of the modes can be important ( see @xcite for a review of back - reaction effects of long wavelength cosmological perturbations ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introductory section , the back - reaction effect of sub - hubble fluctuations is very small and approximately constant in time . on the other hand ,",
    "the back - reaction of long wavelength modes shows secular growth due to the increasing phase space of super - hubble modes .",
    "how is it possible that super - hubble scale modes can effect local physics ?",
    "first of all , note that there is no causality obstacle . during inflation ,",
    "the causal horizon ( the forward light cone ) is ( almost ) exponentially stretched compared to the hubble radius .",
    "all modes we are considering have a wavelength which is smaller than the horizon .",
    "secondly , note an analogy with black hole physics .",
    "if we throw a mass into a black hole , then the mass may have forever disappeared beyond the horizon , but the gravitational effects of this mass remain visible to the observer at infinity . in a similar way , the local gradients of a long wavelength cosmological fluctuation mode may decay exponentially , but the gravitational effects of this mode will persist and have a local effect .    the gravitational back - reaction formalism is as follows @xcite .",
    "we begin with the full einstein field equations [ einstein ] g _ = 8 g t _ , where @xmath15 is the einstein tensor and @xmath16 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter .",
    "the background metric @xmath17 and matter @xmath18 obey these ( nonlinear ) equations .",
    "next we introduce the linearized metric and matter fluctuations @xmath19 and @xmath20 which are both functions of space and time and which obey the linearized einstein equations .",
    "however , the system of fields [ ansatz ] g_(x , t ) & = & g^(0)_(t ) + g_(x , t ) + ( x , t ) & = & ^(0)(t ) + ( x , t ) does not satisfy the einstein equations at second order .",
    "if we are only interested in modifying the background at quadratic order ( modifications of the fluctuations can be considered as well @xcite ) we need to introduce second order correction terms @xmath21 and @xmath22 to metric and matter . adding these terms to the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) for metric and matter , inserting into the einstein equations ( [ einstein ] ) , cancelling the linear terms using the linear fluctuation equations , moving all terms quadratic in the fluctuations to the right hand side , and taking the spatial average of the resulting equation yields an equation of motion for the corrected background metric g^(0 , br)_(t ) = g^(0)_(t ) + g^(2)_(t ) of the following form : g_(g^(0 .",
    "br))(t ) = 8 g , where @xmath23 is quadratic in the cosmological fluctuations , and is called the `` effective energy - momentum tensor of cosmological perturbations '' .",
    "the effective energy momentum tensor is obtained by integrating over the contributions of all fluctuation ( fourier ) modes . for the reasons explained above we are only interested in the contribution of the super - hubble modes .    as background",
    "metric we take a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker - lemitre metric given by the line element ds^2 = a()^2 ( d^2 - d^2 ) , where @xmath24 is conformal time . to evaluate @xmath25 we work in longitudinal ( conformal - newtonian ) gauge in which ( for single component matter without anisotropic stress ) the line element is ds^2 = a()^2 , where @xmath26 is the relativistic gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "the metric and matter fluctuations are not independent .",
    "they are coupled via the einstein constraint equations . in the background of a slowly rolling scalar field",
    "the connection is given by ( k ) = - ( k ) , where the argument @xmath27 indicates that we are considering the fourier modes of the fluctuations .",
    "the general expression for @xmath25 contains many terms ( see e.g. @xcite for the full expression ) .",
    "however , for super - hubble modes the terms containing spatial and temporal derivatives can be neglected , the latter since in an expanding universe the dominant mode of @xmath28 is constant in time .",
    "the terms which survive give a contribution to the energy density of the form [ rhobr ] _",
    "br(t ) ^2 , where @xmath29 is obtained by integrating over all of the super - hubble modes . in the simple chaotic inflation model considered in @xcite ,",
    "the second term in ( [ rhobr ] ) is larger in magnitude than the first , and hence the effective energy density of long wavelength cosmological perturbations is negative .",
    "we shall see that the same is true in the other models considered here .",
    "the effective pressure of cosmological perturbations is p_br - _ br , and hence long wavelength cosmological fluctuations effect the background geometry like a negative cosmological constant ( with possible implications for a possible solution of the cosmological constant problem discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the physical reason why long wavelength fluctuations act as a negative cosmological constant is easy to understand : a matter fluctuation ( with positive matter energy density ) leads to a potential well ( negative gravitational energy density ) , and on super - hubble scales the magnitude of the gravitational energy is larger than that of the matter energy , hence leading to a negative effective energy density .",
    "since no terms with spatial and temporal gradients contribute , the equation of state of @xmath25 has to be that of a cosmological constant .    an important question to ask @xcite",
    "is whether the effects of the contribution of super - hubble modes to @xmath25 are locally measurable .",
    "returning to the black hole example , we note that there needs to be an observer ( the observer at infinity ) to measure the change in the mass of the black hole when some matter is thrown into it . in a similar way , a physical clock field",
    "is required in order to locally measure the effects of the long wavelength contribution to @xmath25 . for purely adiabatic fluctuations ,",
    "the effect is equivalent @xcite to a second order time - translation .",
    "however , in terms of a clock field @xmath30 , the effects of the back - reaction of super - hubble modes is physically measurable @xcite , and it corresponds to a decrease in the local hubble expansion rate @xcite . from now on we will implicitly assume that we have a clock field present which plays the same role as the cmb plays in late time cosmology in setting the clock without producing curvature of space .",
    "at this point we have established that stochastic effects lead ( at least in half of space ) to an increase in the energy density , whereas the back - reaction of super - hubble modes leads to a decrease . in the following",
    ", we will compare the magnitude of these effects in various cosmological models .",
    "we first consider large field power - law inflation models with potential [ power ] v ( ) = m^4 - n ^n , where @xmath31 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath12 is a mass scale .",
    "this class of potentials include the simple chaotic inflation models with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and axion monodromy inflation models which @xmath34 can be a real number in the range @xmath35 @xcite . in the case of",
    "@xmath36 we can without loss of generality set @xmath37 . however , sometimes it is convenient to keep @xmath31 and instead replace @xmath12 by @xmath9 . with the first choice , the condition to obtain small density fluctuations is @xmath38 , in the second case @xmath39 .",
    "note that the region of slow roll inflation corresponds to trans - planckian field value || > ( n ) m_pl , where the @xmath40 is of the order @xmath41 .    taking the derivative of ( [ power ] ) to obtain the classical force and comparing with the stochastic force given by the right hand side of ( [ eom ] ) we get the following field range for which the stochastic force dominates over the classical one : [ stochcond1 ] | | > ( 2 n ) ^f ^-f/2 ( ) ^(2 - n)f m_pl , where the exponent @xmath42 is f = .",
    "it is easy to see that in the case @xmath32 and @xmath43 we recover the condition ( [ stochcond ] ) .",
    "if we are in a region of space in which stochastic effects drive @xmath1 up the potential , the increase in the potential energy over one hubble time @xmath44 is then given by [ deltav ] v v^ , where [ deltavarphi ] = is the change in @xmath1 over one hubble time step ( the coefficient in ( [ deltavarphi ] ) is consistent with the coefficient of the stochastic term in ( [ eom ] ) ) .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the back - reaction of super - hubble modes leads to a negative contribution to the energy density which grows in time during a period of accelerated expansion since modes are exiting the hubble radius and increasing the sea of infrared modes . in order to compare the change in the energy density due to back - reaction with the change due to stochastic evolution we need to evaluate the change in @xmath29 over a hubble time , the same time interval considered above for the stochastic effect .",
    "the starting point is the following expression for the contribution to @xmath29 from super - hubble fourier modes @xmath45 : ^2 ( t ) = 4 _ 0^k_h(t ) k^2 |(k)|^2 dk , where @xmath46 is the comoving wavenumber corresponding to hubble radius crossing at time @xmath4 .",
    "the change in @xmath29 over one hubble time is then given by ^2 = h^-1 4 k_h^2 |(k_h(t))|^2 .",
    "in the case of an exponentially expanding background we have k_h(t ) = a(t ) h .",
    "the corrections to this formula in the case of slow - roll inflation are negligible .    in the case of inflation , the value of @xmath45 at hubble radius crossing is given by the vacuum initial conditions @xcite .",
    "we use the relations ( k ) & & ( k ) + ( k ) & = & z^-1 v(k ) , which express the gravitational potential @xmath28 in terms of the curvature fluctuation variable @xmath47 ( which is conserved in an expanding universe on super - hubble scales ) , which is then in turn related to the canonical fluctuation variable @xmath48 @xcite via the background variable @xmath49 which is given by z = . in the above ,",
    "the equation of state parameter @xmath50 is the ratio of pressure to energy density .",
    "using vacuum initial conditions for @xmath51 we then obtain [ deltaphi ] ^2 = h^4 .",
    "inserting back into the expression ( [ rhobr ] ) for the effective energy density of back - reaction we then obtain ( after using the slow - roll equation of motion to replace @xmath52 in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) : [ rhobr2 ] _ br = m_pl^-2 .",
    "we are now able to compare the magnitude of the increase in energy density due to stochastic rolling up the potential with the decrease due to the increase in @xmath55 . combining the above equations ( [ deltav ] ) , ( [ deltavarphi ] ) and ( [ rhobr2 ] ) yields [ ratio ] = m^2 - n(n + 1 ) ^n - 1 m_pl^-1 . without loss of generality we can set @xmath56 and represent the small slope of the potential ( which is required in order for the cosmological fluctuations induced by inflation not to exceed the observational upper bound ) by a small value @xmath39 of the coupling constant .    in the case",
    "@xmath32 it is clear from ( [ ratio ] ) that @xmath57 is smaller than @xmath58 for all field values .",
    "hence , back - reaction can not prevent eternal inflation . for @xmath59",
    "there is a critical field value @xmath60 beyond which @xmath61 exceeds @xmath58 : _ c = ( ) ^ ^- m_pl which corresponds to trans - planckian energy densities . once again",
    ", back - reaction can not prevent eternal inflation .",
    "finally , for @xmath62 the exponents reverse sign and the condition for @xmath63 to dominate becomes an upper bound for @xmath64 : ||^ < ^1/2 ( n + 1 ) m_pl^ , where @xmath65 .",
    "this is not the field range for inflation .    in conclusion",
    ", we find that in no version of simple power law inflation models back - reaction of long wavelength fluctuations can prevent eternal inflation .",
    "starobinsky s initial model of exponential expanding space was based on a higher derivative gravitational lagrangian @xcite . after a conformal transformation",
    ", it corresponds to einstein gravity in the presence of a scalar matter field @xmath1 with exponential potential v ( ) = a ( 1 - e^-b ) ^2 , where the @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "such potentials also arise in chaotic inflation in supergravity @xcite .",
    "the region of inflation once again corresponds to trans - planckian field values where the potential energy is approximately given by @xmath68 . as in the case of power law inflation discussed in the previous section ,",
    "we first determine the field range where stochastic effects dominate . demanding that the stochastic force amplitude exceeds the classical force yields the condition > b^-1 ln . now we can turn to a comparison of the increase in potential energy due to stochastic rolling up the potential to the change in the energy density of back - reaction . making use of ( [ deltav ] ) and ( [ deltavarphi ] ) , expressing @xmath7 in terms of @xmath54 , and making the approximation @xmath69 we obtain v b a^3/2 e^-b m_pl^-1 . on the other hand , from ( [ rhobr ] ) and ( [ deltaphi ] ) , the change in the energy density of back - reaction is given by _ br - a^2 b^2 e^-b m_pl^-2 .",
    "the ratio is = ^2 a^1/2 b m_pl^-1 which is much smaller than unity for the values of @xmath68 and @xmath70 which need to be chosen to get successful inflation .",
    "hence , we conclude that also in starobinksy inflation back - reaction terms are too weak to prevent eternal inflation .",
    "finally , we turn to the `` dark energy phase '' of the cyclic ekpyrotic scenario . the ekpyrotic scenario is an alternative to inflation for producing the observed inhomogeneities and anisotropies @xcite .",
    "it is based on the horava - witten scenario of heterotic m - theory @xcite , a higher dimensional model . at the effective field theory level it reduces to the theory of a scalar field ( in the higher dimensional picture it corresponds to the separation of parallel branes ) coupled to einstein gravity .",
    "the potential of the scalar field is argued to be a negative exponential .",
    "this setup leads to a bouncing cosmology . according to the ekpyrotic scenario ,",
    "the universe begins in a phase of contraction in which the scalar field is rolling down the potential .",
    "since the potential is negative , one obtains an equation of state with @xmath71 , where the equation of state parameter @xmath50 is the ratio of energy density and pressure .",
    "once the scalar field drops below @xmath72 ( which corresponds to the brane separation approaching the string scale ) , a cosmological bounce is assumed to take place during which regular matter and radiation are produced , leading to a standard big bang phase of expansion during which @xmath1 climbs back up the potential ( while being a subdominant form of matter ) .",
    "cosmological fluctuations are created during the phase of contraction .",
    "as long as an almost massless entropy field is present ( and this completely natural from the higher dimensional point of view @xcite ) , an almost scale - invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations is generated @xcite .    by introducing a slight lift of the potential , i.e. by choosing [ exppot ] v ( ) = c - v_0 e^-a ,",
    "the ekpyrotic scenario becomes `` cyclic '' @xcite .",
    "once @xmath1 during the phase of cosmic expansion reaches values with @xmath73 , a period of accelerated expansion will start .",
    "the scenario thus includes dark energy . based on the classical equation of motion for @xmath1",
    "we would conclude that @xmath1 will eventually turn around and start to decrease .",
    "this leads to a phase of contraction : the ekpyrotic scenario has become cyclic .",
    "figure 2 presents a sketch of space - time in the ekpyrotic scenario .",
    "the vertical axis is time , the horizontal is comoving distance .",
    "the bounce time is taken to be @xmath74 .",
    "the hubble radius decreases very fast before the bounce and then slowly increases in the standard big - bang phase after the bounce . for the cyclic ekpyrotic scenario to work the way it is meant to",
    ", the constant @xmath75 corresponds to the currently observed cosmological constant , whereas the value of @xmath76 corresponds typically to a very high scale ( e.g. the energy scale of grand unification ) .",
    "also , the value of @xmath77 will be given by the inverse string scale .    .",
    "the bounce occurs at @xmath74 and is followed by an expanding phase .",
    "close to the present time , we enter the dark energy phase driven by the term @xmath75 in the potential ( [ exppot ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations which exit the hubble radius during this phase are not vacuum perturbations , but the evolved ones and have a much larger amplitude than vacuum fluctuations would have . ]",
    "a question to ask is whether stochastic effects analogous to the ones which drive stochastic eternal inflation will lead to an eternal stochastic growth of @xmath1 in the ekpyrotic scenario , thus leading to an `` ekpyrotic landscape '' .",
    "intuitively we would not expect this to happen since the stochastic effects are highly suppressed in the dark energy phase ( since @xmath78 ) whereas the cosmological fluctuations ( and hence their back - reaction effects ) are not suppressed compared to the case of inflation . in fact , when the fluctuations exit the hubble radius in the accelerating phase , they are not in the vacuum state , unlike in the case of starobinsky inflation .",
    "hence , the formula for the energy density of back - reaction is different .",
    "these effects lead to an enhancement of the back - reaction `` force '' compared to the stochastic one . in the following we will show that these expectations are indeed borne out .",
    "the value of @xmath1 which corresponds to @xmath79 will be denoted by @xmath80 and is given by e^- a _ 0 = . for field values",
    "significantly larger than @xmath80 we can approximate the value of the potential by @xmath81 . in this case , the increase in potential energy while rolling up the potential for one hubble time is given by [ ekpdeltav ] v ( ) ^1/2 c^3/2 a m_pl^-1 e^-a , where _ 0 + .",
    "turning to the evaluation of the change in the energy density due to back - reaction , it is important to note that the fluctuations which are exiting the hubble radius during the dark energy phase are not the vacuum ones , but the ones which have evolved and have produced the structure which we see on large scales .",
    "we hence have ^2 ~ 1 and hence from ( [ rhobr ] ) _ br = 2 . inserting the form of the ekpyrotic potential and considering large field values we find [ ekpbr ] _",
    "br ~ - 2 c e^a . comparing ( [ ekpdeltav ] ) and ( [ ekpbr ] ) we find = 4",
    "e^2 a . since the scale @xmath75 corresponds to the current dark energy scale ,",
    "the coefficient in front of the exponential in the above equation is many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath41 .",
    "hence we conclude that in the cyclic ekpyrotic scenario back - reaction prevents the stochastic growth of @xmath1 and that there hence is no eternal expansion in the late time dark energy phase for this model .",
    "stochastic effects will lead to the effective scalar field climbing up the potential in some regions of space .",
    "this leads to an increase in the energy density . on the other hand , the back - reaction of fluctuations which have already exited the hubble radius will lead to a decrease in the effective energy density . in this paper we have compared the magnitude of the two effects in various cosmologies with an accelerating phase .",
    "we have shown that for both power - law and starobinsky inflation that strength of the back - reaction effect is too weak to prevent the stochastic growth of @xmath1 and hence does not cut off eternal inflation .",
    "on the other hand , the back - reaction of fluctuations in the dark energy phase of the cyclic ekpyrotic scenario greatly overwhelms the increase in energy due to stochastic dynamics , and hence no eternal expansion in the late time dark energy phase for the ekpyrotic scenario is generated .",
    "it is worth mentioning that besides the calculations done in this paper , we have also looked into generalizations of them .",
    "the first idea was to consider that @xmath82 hubble times could pass so that more modes could leave the hubble radius and the back - reaction effect would be increased to the point that even power - law and starobinsky models could not have eternal inflation . on the other hand",
    ", this would also enhance the stochastic effect since the total @xmath83 would be larger . at the end",
    ", we found that the number @xmath82 for which back - reaction starts to overwhelm the stochastic effect would be unreasonably large in the setup of inflation .",
    "furthermore , one could notice that ( [ rhobr ] ) assumes the slow - roll equation of motion for the inflaton field .",
    "however , since the field is rolling under the influence of the stochastic force , this formula should be generalized .",
    "therefore , we have also treated all the scenarios discussed in this paper using the generalization of the effective energy density of back - reaction obtained when considering the correct equations of motion .",
    "we found that 1 ) for power - law inflation , there are field regions in which the back - reaction effective energy density becomes positive instead of negative , thus being completely unable to prevent eternal inflation ; 2 ) for starobinsky inflation and for the ekpyrotic scenario , the conclusions remain the same as the ones obtained here .",
    "it is also worth while commenting on the relation of our work to the conclusions reached in @xcite . in those works , the question addressed was what the absolute magnitude of the back - reaction energy density is assuming that slow - roll inflation starts at some field value @xmath84 and lasts until @xmath85 . in the case of a potential @xmath86",
    "it was found that if @xmath87 ( in planck units ) then the total energy in the back - reacting infrared modes becomes larger than the background energy density . in that work , however , the effects of the stochastic noise leading to an increase in @xmath1 was not considered .",
    "thus , the questions considered in @xcite and in this paper are complementary",
