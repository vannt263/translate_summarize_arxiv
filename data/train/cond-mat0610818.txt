    "the physics of the high - temperature superconducting oxides is determined by the interplay between the charge and spin degrees of freedom , ultimately responsible for the superconductivity itself .",
    "a variety of interesting phenomena exists already at low doping when the oxide layers are insulating . in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) , the insulating ( spin - glass ) region corresponds to doping @xmath4 , with incommensurate magnetism which exists down to the boundary with the antiferromagnetic phase ( at @xmath5 ) , and even inside the nel region ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xcite a popular point of view favors an explanation of the incommensurate magnetism based on the tendency of the holes to form  stripes . \" @xcite however , experimental data on variable range hopping ( vrh ) ( see the review ref .  ) , unambiguously indicate localization of holes for @xmath4 and therefore support an approach based on a purely magnetic scenario , where a spiral distortion of the spin background is generated by localized holes",
    ". the corresponding theory explains quantitatively the variety of magnetic and transport data in lsco .",
    "@xcite    magnetic phenomena in the low - doping region reflect , in addition to the heisenberg exchange , the presence of anisotropies in the spin - spin interactions , such as dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) and xy terms . in the present paper",
    "we consider the nel phase , @xmath6 . in this phase",
    "the anisotropies confine the spins to the @xmath7 plane and fix the direction of the nel vector to the @xmath8-orthorhombic axis .",
    "moreover , the dm interaction induces a small out - of - plane spin component that is ferromagnetic in the plane ( weak ferromagnetism ) but staggered in the out - of - plane @xmath9-direction .",
    "this component can be easily influenced by an external magnetic field applied in different directions , as it has been recently addressed both experimentally @xcite and theoretically .",
    "@xcite for example , a perpendicular field ( @xmath10 ) can cause an alignment of the out - of - plane moments via a spin - flop transition at a critical field @xmath11 , determined by the competition between the dm and inter - layer heisenberg exchange ( typically @xmath12 ) .",
    "@xcite perhaps most intriguingly , the in - plane resistivity ( along with the @xmath9-axis resistivity ) decreases by as much as @xmath13 across such a transition .",
    "@xcite the magnitude of the magnetoresistance ( mr ) shows a rapid increase only below @xmath14 k @xcite where lsco exhibits vrh conduction .",
    "@xcite this implies that the mr is accumulated mostly in transitions between localized states .",
    "therefore it is very natural to assume that the large negative mr is due to an increase of the hole s localization length as it was suggested in the first experimental paper . @xcite from theoretical viewpoint the problem is why the localization length increases at the spin flop transition .",
    "the first model for the localization length increase , invoking a three - dimensional ( 3d ) vrh mechanism , was proposed in ref .  .",
    "however , it is clear now that except for ultra - low temperatures ( that we estimate to be below @xmath15 ) , the vrh conduction at zero magnetic field is dominated by two - dimensional ( 2d ) physics .",
    "@xcite because of this the 3d picture is not able to describe the most recent and detailed mr data , as we discuss below .",
    "experiments are performed typically in the temperature range of a few kelvin and higher where the out - of - plane resistivity anisotropy is large @xmath16 . @xcite",
    "while we ultimately expect that at @xmath17 vrh will become 3d , in the temperature range of experimental interest the 2d mechanism is the relevant one , as is clear from the analysis of the 2d-3d crossover temperature and the fits of the hopping conductivity presented in the next section .    in the present work",
    "we demonstrate that the large mr arises from a change of the effective dimensionality of the vrh mechanism with applied field .",
    "we support our conclusions by detailed comparison with recent experiments on magnetotransport which can be described by our theory with excellent accuracy .",
    "the main idea of the present work is that a dimensional crossover ( 2d @xmath3 3d ) occurs at the spin flop , and this is conceptually and quantitatively different from the 3d picture of ref .  .",
    "in particular in our approach the increase of the mr ( and the localization length ) is not simply due to the change of the out - of - plane effective mass as in ref .  , but rather arises from a change in the shape of the ( localized ) wave - functions across the spin - flop .",
    "in the temperature regime that we keep in mind , 1k and higher , the change of the out - of - plane effective mass is a small , secondary effect ( which can manifest itself only at ultra - low temperatures where the full 3d vrh mechanism is responsible for transport ) .",
    "we show that the alignment of the weak ferromagnetic moments in neighboring planes with the field allows the inter - layer hopping of localized holes , which in turn leads to an increase of the hole s in - plane hopping probability and thus negative mr .",
    "the presence of an inter - layer hopping channel across the spin - flop was already identified in ref .  ; however our analysis differs in the effects this additional channel can produce in vrh conduction . by investigating the evolution of the hole",
    "bound state as a function of magnetic field and temperature , we find that in various regimes different numbers of layers are involved in transport . in",
    "the experimentally relevant temperature range the hopping turns out to be quasi - two - dimensional , leading to a negative mr in very good agreement with the most recent experiments .",
    "@xcite the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we analyze the effect of the magnetic field on the dispersion of the localized holes , through the inter - layer hopping . in section",
    "iii we present a detailed analysis of the change of the hole s wave - function , due to the modified dispersion . in sections",
    "iv and v we then use the wave - functions to calculate the magnetoresistance for out - of - plane and in - plane magnetic fields , and compare with experiment .",
    "section vi contains our conclusions .",
    "first we briefly summarize previous results related to the structure of the hole s 2d bound state at zero field .",
    "as a starting point , we consider the hole dynamics in the antiferromagnetic background within the framework of the @xmath19 model .",
    "@xcite in the absence of the coulomb potential @xmath20 of the sr ion , a hole resides , in momentum space , near the nodal points @xmath21 and has dispersion @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the inverse 2d effective mass appropriate for lsco @xcite ( @xmath24 in absolute units ) .",
    "we measure energies in units of @xmath25 , and the lattice spacing is set to unity . due to @xmath20",
    ", the hole is localized , and its wave function has the form @xmath26 , corresponding to binding energy @xmath27 . here the inverse ( 2d ) localization radius for lsco is @xmath28 , @xcite giving @xmath29 . on a perfect square lattice",
    "the bound state is four - fold degenerate : the hole can reside on either up or down sub - lattices ( pseudospin ) , and it can reside in either of the two pockets @xmath30 ( flavor ) .",
    "the orthorhombic distortion lifts the flavor degeneracy due to the presence of diagonal next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath31 .",
    "hence , the holes occupy only the pocket @xmath32 . @xcite this is also consistent with the fact that the spin structure becomes incommensurate along the @xmath8 orthorhombic direction , as seen in neutron scattering for @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite    now let us consider the correction to the 2d dispersion @xmath34 arising from the inter - layer hopping @xmath35 . without account of correlations",
    "we have @xmath36 , with @xmath37-dependent @xmath35 , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite by averaging over the momentum distribution ( @xmath40 ) in the 2d bound state , we find the effective value of inter - layer hopping @xmath41 .",
    "since this is a crude , order of magnitude estimate , below we will use @xmath35 as a fitting parameter .",
    "the @xmath42 model correlations change @xmath34 .",
    "first , the hopping matrix element should be replaced by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the quasiparticle residue .",
    "second , direct hopping is allowed only between spins in the same sublattice . in lsco a spin in a given plane ( e.g. spin  1 \" in fig .",
    "1 ) interacts with four others in the plane above ( and below ) , @xcite but at @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) only out - of - plane hopping in the @xmath47 direction is allowed , because this corresponds to ferromagnetic ordering of spins in neighboring planes ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "however , when a magnetic field is applied along the @xmath9-axis the spins in the next layer reverse their signs across the spin - flop transition at @xmath48 , so that for @xmath49 only hopping in the @xmath50 direction contributes .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig .  1 , and reflects in the effective dispersion : @xmath51 where we define the z - direction @xmath52 .",
    "since in the occupied pocket @xmath53 , @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( [ zdispersion ] ) reads @xmath55 thus at @xmath56 there is no z - dispersion , the coherent dynamics is purely 2d and the vrh in - plane resistivity behaves as @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite @xmath58 is strongly doping and sample dependent , and the data at zero field , @xmath59 can be fitted by @xmath60 and @xmath61 with astonishing accuracy in the range @xmath62k , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](inset ) .    observe that a more accurate estimate of the z - dynamics below the spin flop can be obtained by expanding the in - plane dispersion @xmath63 around @xmath32 and minimizing the resulting quadratic form .",
    "this gives a non - zero dispersion in the z - direction , but the corresponding effective mass is huge , @xmath64 \\sim 10 ^ 4m_e$ ] .",
    "consequently we find that at temperatures below @xmath65 , the vrh is ultimately three - dimensional , but this regime is irrelevant to present experiments .    ; the blue arrows in the middle layer show the spin reversal for @xmath66 . ]",
    "to qualitatively understand the effect of the change of dispersion ( [ dispersion2 ] ) at @xmath67 on the in - plane hole dynamics , we first estimate the change in the hole binding energy . from ( [ dispersion2 ] ) , after the spin flop the edge of the continuum ( @xmath68 ) decreases by @xmath69 , while the absolute energy of the bound state , to second order in the small parameter @xmath70 , decreases only by amount @xmath71 . the binding energy , which is the magnitude of the difference between the absolute energy and the continuum limit , changes after the flop as @xmath72 within the vrh picture the conduction is proportional to the hole s hopping probability , which decays exponentially away from the donor site due to the hole localization .",
    "thus , the decrease of the hole binding energy ( [ binding ] ) across the spin flop signals an increase of the localization length , and in turn an increase of the vrh conductivity .",
    "this is our central idea that explains the negative mr .    to make this argument more quantitative , we need to compute the change in the hole s hopping probability across the spin - flop transition .",
    "let us enumerate planes by the index @xmath73 and assume for simplicity that sr produces a _",
    "local _ potential @xmath20 that acts only in the plane @xmath74 . for a shallow level",
    "the exact form of the local potential is not important , @xcite and for simplicity we will use the @xmath75-function approximation : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is assumed to be smaller than the localization length , @xmath78 .",
    "the bound state is described by the wave function @xmath79 that depends on both @xmath73 and @xmath80 . before the spin flop , @xmath56",
    ", it obeys the schrdinger equation : @xmath81 , where @xmath82 .",
    "the solution for @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 , and for @xmath85 it reads @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the modified bessel functions of the first and second kind respectively . for the inverse localization length",
    "we obtain @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is euler s constant .",
    "however the exact dependence of @xmath91 on the parameters of the potential is not important , since the energy scale that @xmath91 determines , the binding energy @xmath92 , was extracted from experiment in earlier work , @xmath29 ( see section ii ) .",
    "for @xmath67 the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath93 = e\\psi_n , \\ ] ] with @xmath76 , and @xmath94 . after the fourier",
    "transform @xmath95 we obtain @xmath96 by solving this equation we find @xmath97 thus , as we have already pointed out before eq .",
    "( [ binding ] ) , after the spin flop the absolute energy @xmath98 is shifted only in the second order in @xmath99 and hence this shift can be neglected . consequently below",
    "we set @xmath100 .",
    "however , in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ psi0n ] ) , the new wave function , @xmath101 does not have a simple exponential decay .",
    "( solid , blue line ) across the spin - flop transition for @xmath102 .",

    "the circles are data from ref .  .",
    "inset : zero field in - plane resistivity fit to 2d vrh form ( solid , red line ) with @xmath61 . ]",
    "to evaluate the mr across the spin flop we compute now the change of the hole s probability to propagate at the ( large ) vrh distance @xmath104 : @xmath105 .",
    "@xcite we can then identify two large - distance regimes for the wave function ( [ psin ] ) : ( 1 ) very large distances , @xmath106 , and ( 2 ) intermediate large distances , @xmath107 .    in the first regime the integral in ( [ psin ] ) can be evaluated using the saddle - point approximation and the wave function is spread over many transverse channels , @xmath108 .",
    "the probability density at distance @xmath80 , @xmath109 in this regime the wave function has a pure exponential decay with a localization length corresponding to the shift of the binding energy given in eq .",
    "( [ binding ] ) .",
    "we then find that the ratio of conductivities after ( @xmath67 ) and before ( @xmath56 ) the flop is @xmath110 here @xmath111 , with @xmath112 from eq.([psi0n ] ) .",
    "this result is valid when @xmath113 , which happens in practice when the temperature is below @xmath114 . in this case",
    "@xmath115 , i.e. the corresponding mr is large : @xmath116 , and a full 2d @xmath3 3d crossover is expected in the spin flop .",
    "notice that the mr is always negative , @xmath117 .    in the intermediate large distances regime , @xmath118 , the integral in ( [ psin ] ) can be evaluated by direct expansion in powers of @xmath119 .",
    "only the layers @xmath120 contribute in this case , @xmath121 , leading to @xmath122 from ( [ prs ] ) we obtain ( @xmath123 ) across the spin flop @xmath124 this formula corresponds to a crossover from a pure 2d case to an  intermediate dimension \" ( three transverse channels ) , and it is justified when @xmath125 .",
    "we have also performed a full numerical evaluation of @xmath126 and of the mr with @xmath79 from eq .",
    "( [ psin ] ) , since the above considerations are based on asymptotic behavior .",
    "the exact numerical form was used in both figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] below .",
    "we have found quite clearly that indeed in the temperature range where experimental data are available , @xmath127 , the intermediate asymptotic formula ( [ slxs ] ) is the relevant one , since the mr is still relatively small there , e.g. @xmath128 .",
    "however as the temperature is lowered , @xmath129 , the mr increases and the system enters a crossover region between the asymptotic formulas eq .",
    "( [ slxs ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ult ] ) , which requires the use of the exact wave - functions .",
    "the calculated mr is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and we observe that the fitted value @xmath130 agrees quite well with the estimate @xmath131 from band structure calculations .",

    "the squares are data from ref .  .",
    "inset : evolution of the angle ( [ angle ] ) with field . ]",
    "in this case , due to the alignment of the dm - induced moments with the magnetic field , the spins rotate in the @xmath135 plane ( in opposite directions on the two sub - lattices ) , @xcite and align completely along @xmath9 at a field @xmath136 .",
    "thus , once we introduce the angle @xmath137 that the spins make with the @xmath8-direction , our previous calculations leading to eq .",
    "( [ slxs ] ) remain valid with the replacement @xmath138 .",
    "observe that while for the undoped lco an intermediate in - plane spin flop is expected at @xmath139 , @xcite in lsco the doped holes contribute to enhance the @xmath8-axis spin susceptibility and then to confine the spins in the @xmath135 plane , as it has been discussed recently in ref .  .",
    "we can then write the field dependence of @xmath140 between @xmath45 and @xmath141 as @xmath142 in the above expression @xmath143 is the dm anisotropy , @xmath144 is the inter - layer exchange , @xmath145 is the out - of - plane ( or xy ) anisotropy gap , @xmath146 is the staggered order parameter , @xmath147 is the doping and @xmath148 is a dimensionless measure of the holes - induced spin susceptibility . here",
    "@xmath149 is measured in units of @xmath150 , with @xmath151 and @xmath152 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the parameter values can be extracted from the experiments , @xcite and for @xmath59 we take @xmath153 mev , @xmath154 ( mev)@xmath155 , @xmath156 mev , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , which gives @xmath159 t. @xcite using @xmath160 as the only fitting parameter , we find a remarkable agreement with the experimental data of ref .   at @xmath161 k , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "we also note that in oxygen - doped compounds the contribution of the localized holes to the longitudinal susceptibility is much smaller , with @xmath162 .",
    "@xcite as a consequence , one expects to observe at a field @xmath163 t an intermediate flop which reflects in a kink in both the @xmath164 curve and in the mr curve , as it has been measured indeed in the earlier transport measurements in la@xmath165cuo@xmath166 .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that in the strongly localized vrh regime for @xmath167 , the in - plane mr is sensitive to the inter - layer hopping @xmath168 because an external magnetic field effectively changes the dimensionality of the problem , making the hopping quasi-2d .",
    "the mr reflects the physics of the spin - flop and is always negative ; its value as well as temperature and field dependence are in excellent quantitative agreement with recent experiments in lsco at @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite orbital effects , typically causing positive mr , @xcite are negligible at this small doping because the hole s localization length @xmath169 is much smaller than the magnetic length at any reasonable fields .",
    "finally we comment that unlike lsco where the role of magnetic anisotropies is very well established , in insulating yba@xmath165cu@xmath170o@xmath171 ( ybco ) such anisotropies are expected to be very weak , which is related to the absence of strong localization in this material .",
    "@xcite spin - related effects in the in - plane mr are absent for field in the @xmath9 direction , while the in - plane field mr remains small and appears to be due to the dynamics of holes that are very weakly influenced by disorder .",
    "@xcite the complete understanding of these phenomena in ybco remains an open issue although it is clear that magnetotransport is not dominated by the local spin physics .",
