    "in the color dipole picture @xcite , the scattering process @xmath10 is assumed to proceed in three stages : first the incoming real photon fluctuates into a quark ",
    "antiquark pair , then the @xmath11 pair scatters elastically on the proton , and finally the @xmath11 pair recombines to form a virtual photon ( which subsequently decays into lepton pairs ) . the amplitude for production of the exclusive final state such as a virtual photon in tcs , is given by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the amplitude for a photon to fluctuate into a quark ",
    "antiquark dipole with helicities @xmath14 and @xmath15 and flavour @xmath16 .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 is the elementary amplitude for the scattering of a dipole of size @xmath18 on the proton , @xmath19 denotes the transverse momentum lost by the outgoing proton ( with @xmath20 ) , @xmath8 is the bjorken variable and @xmath21 is the photon virtuality .",
    "as one has a real photon at the initial state , only the transversely polarized overlap function contributes to the cross section .",
    "the expression for the overlap function can be found for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our numerical calculations",
    "we use still the space - like kinematics and we expect not a large deviation from the correct kinematics . however , the approximation we have considered to estimate the cross section should be taken with due care . it should be noticed that some corrections to this exclusive process are needed . for tcs one should use the off - diagonal gluon distribution , since the exchanged gluons carry different fractions @xmath8 and @xmath22 of the proton s ( light - cone ) momentum .",
    "the skewed effect can be accounted for , in the limit that @xmath23 , by multiplying the elastic differential cross section by a correction factor @xcite .",
    "we quote ref .",
    "@xcite for details .    in the numerical calculations we consider the non - forward saturation model of ref .",
    "@xcite ( mps model ) , which has the advantage of giving directly the @xmath1 dependence of elastic differential cross section without the necessity of considerations about the impact parameter details of the process .",
    "it is based on the studies about the growth of the dipole amplitude towards the saturation regime is the geometric scaling regime @xcite .",
    "the geometric scaling property can be extended to the case of non zero momentum transfer @xcite , provided @xmath24 , where the elementary dipole amplitude now reads as : @xmath25 with the @xmath1 dependence of the saturation scale being parametrised as @xmath26 in order to interpolate smoothly between the small and intermediate transfer regions .",
    "the scaling function @xmath27 is obtained from the forward saturation model @xcite .    in the case of nuclear targets , we make use of studies of ref .",
    "@xcite where the high energy @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath3 collisions have been related through geometric scaling . in that approach , the nuclear saturation scale was assumed to rise with the quotient of the transverse parton densities , @xmath30 , to the power @xmath31 , that is @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the nuclear radius ) .",
    "this assumption successfully describes small-@xmath8 data for @xmath34 and @xmath35 scattering using @xmath36 and a same scaling curve for the proton and nucleus @xcite .",
    "therefore , we propose the following expression for the elementary dipole amplitude for nuclear case : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the nuclear form factor .",
    "it should be stressed that we consider only the coherent nuclear scattering , whereas the incoherent case is neglected .    as we investigate the exclusive photoproduction of a heavy timelike photon which decays into a lepton pair , @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath40 invariant mass distribution from the virtual @xmath41 decay we have ( with @xmath42 ) , @xmath43",

    "@xmath48 gev , a power fit can be performed in the form @xmath49 , with @xmath50 gev .",
    "considering the mps model , one obtains the values @xmath51 pb and @xmath52 . in order to study the sensitivity to the model dependence , we compare the mps saturation model to two different distinct saturation models .",
    "the first one is the recent implementation of the impact parameter color glass condensate model @xcite ( hereafter watt , dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the second one is the impact parameter saturation model @xcite(hereafter b - sat , long dashed line ) . in these implementations ,",
    "the elementary dipole - nucleon scattering amplitude is written in the impact parameter space . at high energies",

    ", we obtain the parameters @xmath53 pb and @xmath54 . in the b - sat model we have the values @xmath55 pb and @xmath56 .",
    "we clearly verify a distinct energy dependence , which depends on the characteristics features of the phenomenological models .",
    "the main point is the value of the parameter @xmath57 entering at the saturation scale . the watt model gives the softer energy dependence , which comes from the small value of @xmath58 in the saturation scale , @xmath59 . on the other hand , in the mps model one has @xmath60 ( a factor two larger than in watt model ) and",
    "the qcd evolution makes the effective @xmath57 value for b - sat model to be large .",
    "the different overall normalization at energies @xmath61 gev for the mps model is probably result of distinct behavior towards low energies .    concerning the nuclear targets , in ref .",
    "@xcite we also compute the integrated cross section per nucleon as a function of energy for @xmath62 ( lead ) , which is relevant for electromagnetic interactions at @xmath3 collisions at the lhc .",
    "the nuclear version of mps model at high energies ( @xmath63 gev ) can be parameterized as @xmath64 . for",
    "the b - sat model one obtains at high energies @xmath65 .",
    "accordingly , we verify a larger suppression in the mps model than in b - sat , which is directly related to the nuclear saturation scale at each model .",
    "absorption is evident in mps model , where the effective power on energy has diminished in the nuclear case .",
    "the present calculations are input for the exclusive photoproduction of dileptons in electromagnetic interactions in @xmath2 and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "let us concentrate on the @xmath2 case , where the processes is characterized by the photon - proton interaction , with the photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons .",
    "the total cross section for the @xmath66 process is obtained by the product of the photon - proton cross section and the photon energy spectrum , @xmath67 , and integration over the photon energy , @xmath68 : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the lorentz boost of a single beam , @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the centre of mass energy of the hadron - hadron system @xcite .",
    "the initial factor of 2 in above equation accounts for the interchange of the photon emitter and the target .",
    "this process is characterized by small momentum transfer and energy loss , which implies that the outgoing hadrons should be detected in the forward regions of detectors .",
    "the final state is relatively clear , presenting two rapidity gaps and central dilepton production .",
    "therefore , this process has a similar final state as the produced in gamma - gamma scattering . in table 1",
    ", we present an estimative for @xmath2 collisions for tevatron and the lhc energies ( integrated over invariant mass @xmath73 gev ) . for the tevatron case",
    ", we also present the result for the current cut on invariant dilepton mass @xmath74 which refers to upcoming exclusive dimuon cdf measurements @xcite . in order to compare it to the qed case ,",
    "we quote the value @xmath75 pb from the process @xmath76 . in the @xmath3 the photon flux",
    "is enhanced by a factor @xmath77 , then we would expect the cross sections to reach dozens of nanobarns for @xmath78 collisions at the lhc .",
    "the result presented here can be compared to qcd factorization formalism for exclusive processes involving the gpds @xcite .",
    "the authors in ref @xcite have found a strong dependence on the factorization scale .",
    "the compton contribution was estimated to be 1.9 pb at lhc using the cut @xmath79 gev and additional cuts on polar and azimuthal angles . using the same kinematical",
    "cut they found a cross section of 2.9 pb for the bethe - heitler contribution .",
    "we believe that applying similar cuts , our results for the cross section can be compatible with values presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the lhc case .    as a summary , using the color dipole formalism we studied the timelike compton scattering .",
