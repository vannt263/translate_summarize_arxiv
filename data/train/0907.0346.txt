    "spectral absorption line strengths of galaxies can be used to probe their star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "these techniques are becoming increasingly refined and better understood in terms of breaking underlying degeneracies in age and metallicity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite - hereafter ps02 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and accurate interpretation of integrated light observations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "uncertainties in stellar population models limit the effectiveness of these studies .",
    "one outstanding question that needs to be addressed is : how are the observed spectral line strengths in integrated stellar populations affected by abundance changes due to interacting binary stars ?",
    "most modellers of composite stellar populations take into account the element yields from sneia explosions from interacting binary stars ( normally the chandrasekhar mass , w7 model of @xcite ) however , yields from other types of interacting binary star processes , such as various common envelope binaries that do not necessarily become sneia , are seldom taken into account .    in most studies ,",
    "unresolved stellar populations in galaxies are characterised by their luminosity weighted average properties , by fitting observed spectral line - strengths to predictions from single age , single metallicity stellar population ( ssp ) models ( e.g. ps02 , @xcite ) .",
    "the system of line strengths most widely used is that of lick indices ( @xcite ; @xcite ) based on observations of stars taken at the lick observatory .",
    "this is the system of line - strength definitions and calibration star data that is used in this paper , to link effectively to observable properties of galaxy spectra .    in some cases",
    "more complex sfh fitting , to line strengths or colours , is attempted using e.g. multiple ssps ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or an exponentially decaying sfh ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) sometimes with optional starbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "empirical fitting of too many ssps is undermined by the degeneracy between parameters .",
    "optical spectra of old , metal - poor ssps can look remarkably similar to those of younger , more metal - rich ssps , because both increasing age and increasing metallicity depreciate the blue continuum .",
    "additional constraints are provided by making the sfh self consistent with the feedback into the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) from which stars are made .",
    "this is the approach of galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) modelling , where elemental abundances are followed for a given sfh , in order to model composite stellar populations .",
    "single ssp fitting is more robust than trying to fit the full sfh , and ssp fitting can be carried out for lower signal - to - noise data ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "however an ssp is a poor representation of the sfh of a real galaxy . on the other hand",
    ", gce modelling may lead to a more realistic determination of the sfh , but requires higher signal - to - noise data ( @xmath1 ) , depending on the complexity of the underlying sfh .",
    "therefore the two techniques provide complementary approaches to determining when stars formed in galaxies",
    ".    full spectrum fitting seems a promising alternative to lick index fitting @xcite but there is currently no model that predicts the full ( visible ) spectrum of stellar populations with a range of non - solar abundance ratios , even though progress is being made with this ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this present work",
    "we limit ourselves to fitting lick indices .",
    "@xcite calculated the effects on luminosity weighted age and metallicity estimates , derived from spectral line strengths and colours , when binary interactions are included in the calculations of stellar evolution .",
    "they considered the extreme case of 100% stars in binaries .",
    "their models were based on the rapid binary star evolution code of @xcite , which predicts physical aspects of binary star components , such as their mass , size , separation , luminosity and temperature etc . with time .",
    "they took into account the evolution and effects on spectral characteristics of the above physical effects of binary stars in a population , and showed what this meant for line strengths in ssps of different ages and metallicities .",
    "although they concluded that it is important to model binary stars , their results actually show fairly small changes in most line strengths because of binary evolution , with changes in line strengths of up to a few times the typical state - of - the - art observational errors , as discussed in section  [ obs - errors ] of this paper .",
    "for example , changes in @xmath2 were up to @xmath3 for populations with minus without binary interactions .",
    "@xcite find similar results .",
    "however , they did not model the yields from binary stars , nor did they consider non - solar element abundance ratios in their ssps .",
    "@xcite combined initial properties of stars with stellar evolutionary models ( theirs and others ) to generate the yields from stellar populations including binary types .",
    "they found that including the effects of binaries ( apart from sneia ) leads to small changes in the predicted yields .",
    "other uncertainties in stellar evolution ( e.g. mass - loss rates , massive - star remnant masses etc . ) make at least as much difference to the chemical yields .    in this paper",
    "we take a complementary approach and consider the effect of incorporating yields from single and binary star populations into a gce model in order to determine the effect of chemistry on absorption line strengths .",
    "we apply the code of @xcite and @xcite to calculate the yields of both single- and binary - stellar populations of different metallicities as a function of age . in that work ,",
    "as expected , the main difference between single- and binary - star populations is the effect of sneia , but yields from giant stars are also reduced in binary populations .",
    "this is because when a star becomes a giant it is most likely to interact with a close companion and lose mass through non - conservative roche - lobe overflow and common - envelope evolution .",
    "the yields of elements produced in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars e.g. carbon , nitrogen and @xmath4-process elements such as barium , are reduced by up to @xmath5 compared to single stars .",
    "we combine the single- and binary - star yields with a galactic chemical evolution model which parameterises star formation histories with six variable parameters .",
    "these are tuned to simulate a range of galaxy types ( ps02 ) .",
    "unfortunately , a major uncertainty in our yield calculation , and hence in our gce models , arises from the calculation of yields from type ia supernovae .",
    "while our binary population synthesis model predicts a certain ia rate based on the algorithm of @xcite , there are several progenitor channels , all of which are seriously affected by model parameters ( e.g. the common - envelope ejection efficiency ) .",
    "worse still , it is not known which progenitor channels are truly responsible for sneia .    in order to consider quantitatively this uncertainty ,",
    "we have split our binary yield set into two parts : sneia and `` other binary yields '' .",
    "the sneia set is then subdivided into two channels : 1 ) sub-@xmath6 explosions , which in our model arise from edge - lit detonations ( elds ) , where @xmath7 is the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "these explode when a co white dwarf ( cowd ) accretes more than @xmath8 of helium - rich material .",
    "2 ) @xmath6 explosions arise from the accretion of material onto a cowd until it reaches a mass of @xmath6 .",
    "this set includes cowd - cowd mergers .",
    "the `` other binary yields '' set , which includes yields due to all other processes in binary stars such as non - conservative roche - lobe overflow , common - envelope ejecta , novae , stellar winds etc . , is then treated separately from the uncertainties in sneia yields .",
    "there is a time delay between the formation of a binary system that could lead to a snia and the explosion itself .",
    "this time delay depends on the type of snia progenitor ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and this affects the timescale of enrichment of the ism with iron in galaxies .",
    "thus it is important to study the effects of different sneia progenitors and the parameters associated with their production rates .",
    "previous authors have described how the various sources of enrichment are expected to contribute to the yields with time in a stellar population ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , type ii snae from massive stars will contribute a broad range of metals including the important @xmath9-capture elements ( o , ne , mg , si , s.ar , ca etc . ) on short timescales ( @xmath10 years , approximately the pre - supernova lifetime of an @xmath11 star ) ; whereas sneia from interacting binary star channels contribute mainly iron - peak elements ( cr , fe , ni ) , over longer timescales ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "intermediate mass single stars recycle h and he and also contribute to he , c , n and o yields .",
    "intermediate mass stars in binary systems other than snia also contribute small amounts of other heavy elements ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these different sources are all included in our gce models .",
    "this paper addresses the question of how these yields affect spectral line strengths in self - consistent gce models , covering a variety of star formation histories .",
    "variations of abundances and abundance ratios are taken into account through the ssp line - strength models used .",
    "section  [ section - models ] describes our models of binary - star yields and our gce models .",
    "section  [ section - effect - of - binaries ] describes how these combined models are used to test the effects of including other binary yields , besides sneia , on line strengths ; section  [ section - different - sneia ] explores some effects of different snia models and common envelope parameters on line strengths ; some discussion is given in section  [ section - discussion ] and section  [ section - conclusions ] summarises our results .",
    "in this section we briefly describe our models . we begin with our single- and binary - star stellar yield calculations and follow with a description of their implementation into our galactic chemical evolution code .",
    "our yields are calculated for single and binary stars according to the rapid binary evolution and nucleosynthesis models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "stellar evolution is based on the algorithm of @xcite which uses analytic fits to stellar properties such as luminosity , radius and core mass to follow stellar evolution for stars of masses up to @xmath12 from the main sequence to the end of evolution , either as a white dwarf or in a supernova explosion .",
    "this is coupled to a binary interaction scheme which models tidal interaction , mass transfer by winds and roche - lobe overflow , mass accretion , common envelope evolution , novae etc .",
    "the nucleosynthesis routine runs in parallel to the stellar evolution algorithm and follows the surface abundances of stars during all phases of evolution .",
    "it includes the following :    * a synthetic thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch model which mimics the behaviour of the detailed models of @xcite and @xcite , including third dredge up and hot - bottom burning by the cno , nena and mgal cycles . * surface abundances , and hence stellar wind yields , from massive stars according to @xcite , @xcite and stancliffe ( private communication ) .",
    "* core - collapse supernovae according to the calculations of @xcite . * snia yields from sub - chandrasekhar mass ( sub-@xmath6 ) and chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath6 ) explosions ( yields from @xcite and the dd2 model of @xcite respectively ) . * nova yields of @xcite . *",
    "stellar wind collision , accretion and time - dependent thermohaline mixing into secondary stars .",
    "many parameters are associated with both our single- and binary - star models , these are discussed in some detail in @xcite .",
    "we make no changes from the standard assumptions used there , except that orbital energy transfer parameter @xmath13 is set to @xmath14 as suggested by @xcite in order to maximise the effect of sneia .",
    "the common envelope structure parameter @xmath15 is fitted to the data of @xcite and @xcite although we optionally allow for a fixed value of @xmath16 ( see section  [ effects - of - different - sneia ] ) .",
    "this constitutes our `` baseline model '' referred to in later sections .",
    "we note that the rate ( and hence yield ) of @xmath6 sneia is considerably less than typically used in gce models , but we make up for this with copious numbers of @xmath17 supernovae .",
    "a detailed study of the rates and yields of sneia is beyond the scope of this paper but a preliminary exploration is carried out in section  [ section - different - sneia ] .",
    "our yield sets are calculated by integrating yields for a population of stars using the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) with masses between @xmath18 and @xmath19 for single stars and binary primary stars , a binary secondary mass distribution which is flat in mass ratio @xmath20 such that all secondary masses ( less than the primary mass i.e. @xmath21 ) are equally likely , and a binary separation distribution which is flat in @xmath22-separation ( i.e. distributed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the binary separation ) between @xmath14 and @xmath25 .",
    "the yields were generated in @xmath26 bins for a maximum time baseline of @xmath27 .",
    "it proved difficult to temporally resolve yield output at late times when using our standard logarithmic grid for the primary mass . to resolve this we applied an algorithm which chooses the primary masses as a function of the main - sequence lifetime such that yield rate at late times",
    "is time - resolved and smooth .",
    "we split our yield calculations into three sets :    * single stars ( @xmath4 ) , * binary stars , excluding sneia ( @xmath28 ) , and * sneia ( of all types ) ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "these contributions to yields are combined in different proportions in our gce models ( see sections  [ gce - models ] and [ section - effect - of - binaries ] ) .",
    "our gce model self - consistently follows the mass and chemistry of both stars and the ism for a given sfh ( see ps02 for a detailed description ) which is described by a simple but flexible parameterisation . a salpeter imf is assumed for the stars , as available for the ssps . a schmidt law is assumed for the star formation rate : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the gas mass within a fixed volume and @xmath32 is the efficiency of star formation .",
    "sixteen of the most abundant elements are followed individually in our gce model and are then combined into groups when linked to ssp models .",
    "the chemistry and mass of stars thus generated as a function of time are converted into observables through the use of ssps .",
    "we use line strength predictions from the ssp models of @xcite - hereafter tmk04 .",
    "these allow not only for age and metal mass fraction ( @xmath33 ) variations in stellar populations but also for dependencies of line strengths on element abundance ratios , characterised by the ratio of @xmath34-capture to iron - peak elements ( @xmath35}}$]}}=\\log(\\alpha/\\mathrm{fe})-\\log(\\alpha_\\odot/\\mathrm{fe}_\\odot)$ ] , with @xmath34 and fe being the gas mass fractions of @xmath34-capture and fe - peak elements from which the stars are made .",

    "carbon remains separate from the @xmath34-elements in the models of tmk04 .",
    "the parameters that describe the sfhs of our gce models are listed in table  [ sfh - table ] and a schematic illustration is given in fig .",
    "a1 of appendix  [ gce - parameters ] .",
    "these allow for a wide range of possible sfhs , covering early star formation ( sf ) , described by the sf efficiency ( @xmath36 ) and gas inflow rate ( @xmath37 ) , plus an optional , more recent sf event .",
    "there are parameters for the onset time ( @xmath38 ) , duration ( @xmath39 ) and star formation efficiency ( @xmath40 ) of this later event , as well as the gas inflow rate ( @xmath41 ) during this more recent sf event .",
    "the sf and gas flow are switched off after the merger event because elliptical galaxies show little evidence for ongoing star formation or massive gas flows .",

    "the motivation for our choice of sfhs was to cover a range of representative histories approximating early - type ( e , s0 ) galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , including early ( primordial ) collapse models , early collapse followed by later star formation to mimic later mergers ( at 2 or 5 gyrs ago ) and finally a model approximating the rapid merger 2 gyr ago of two spiral galaxies like the milky way in their pre - merger sfr , accompanied by a merger induced starburst .",

    "* and references therein ) ; @xcite ) indicate how difficult it is to form sneia through this conventionally assumed route of a cowd increasing its mass through steady accretion and burning of material from an interacting companion star until it reaches the chandrasekhar mass limit ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the difficulty arises in the unstable nature of the accretion : too rapid and a common envelope may form , which does not necessarily lead to a snia ; too slow and novae ( probably ) lead to mass loss .",
    "the theoretical mass accretion rates under which a standard snia can form cover only a factor of a few up to a few @xmath87 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite suggest that accretion rates of @xmath88 to @xmath89 could lead to sneia if the accreting white dwarf has a strong wind that effectively reduces the accretion rate to that required for steady accretion . here",
    "we refer to this as the disk wind model .",
    "there are other channels that may lead to a chandrasekhar - mass cowd and hence a ia supernova .",
    "these include close double - degenerate ( cowd - cowd ) systems , which merge because of orbital shrinkage caused by gravitational radiation .",
    "theoretically , he white dwarfs in binaries may also contribute to snia , however , evidence for their existence as sneia progenitors is lacking ( @xcite ) .",
    "sub - chandrasekhar mass models , while currently out of favour as ia progenitors , dominate the rate of sneia in our binary models .",
    "these are mostly edge - lit detonations ( elds ) of cowds accreting @xmath90 of helium - rich material which ignites , setting off the whole star .",
    "if these types of sneia really do dominate the yields then it is important to study whether there are any chemical signatures that could be used to confirm their presence in integrated stellar populations .",
    "table  [ table - snia - yields ] shows the relative contributions from different types of sneia from our binary yields at different metallicities assuming our baseline binary - star plus single - star model ( section  [ yield - calculations ] ) .",
    "this shows that yields from elds dominate the snia contributions in our models , particularly at high metallicity .",
    "the exact mix of snia types does not matter for the tests of the impact of other binary yields ( from common - envelope evolution , novae etc . ) on line strengths ( section  [ obs - errors ] above ) , but it may limit our ability to accurately interpret line strengths from galaxies .",
    "therefore we go on to try to test the impact of different sneia on spectral line strengths .",
    "as expected , iron dominates the yields from the sneia in these models ( see table  [ table - snia - yields ] ) .",
    "[ fig-4 ] shows the time evolution of iron for two different categories of sneia .",
    "note from these plots how the distributions are sensitive to the initial metallicity of the stars .",

    "[ fig-4 ] the feedback from sneia includes a large peak at very early times ( @xmath91 yr ) plus extended feedback at a lower level , generally decreasing over the rest of the time .",

    "our gce model was modified to allow yields from different proportions of the various snia types .",
    "yield sets were calculated from weighted sums of the following subsets of the baseline yields : +    1 .",
    "single stars , + 2 .   binary stars ( excluding sneia ) , + 3 .",
    "sneia ( baseline model ) , + 4 .",

    "that is , the sum of equal weight contributions from iv , v and vi above add up to the baseline model snia contributions ( iii above ) .",
    "option vi labelled others consists of yields from chandrasekhar - mass snia explosions .",
    "table  [ table - snia - tests ] lists the eight test cases with corresponding weighting factors .",
    "the results of each test are then compared with the baseline model ( which uses proportions given in equation  [ eq-1 ] , equivalent to test  1 ) .",
    "differences that arise are then due to the proportions of snia types included .",
    "the maximum difference in any line strength , relative to the relevant observational error and the root mean square difference in all line strengths relative to observation errors are also shown in table  [ table - snia - tests ] .",
    "tests 1 and 2 are equivalent to our populations b , the `` baseline model '' , and s ( eqs .",
    "[ eq-1 ] and [ eq-2 ] respectively ) .",
    "again this shows that the effect of changing from a purely single - star population with sneia to a true half - single and half - binary population is within the observational uncertainties on the line strengths .",
    "parameters that quantify the behaviour of a common envelope ( ce ) formed around a close binary can affect the number and type of sneia that occur , particularly the number of double degenerates that can merge to form sneia .",
    "the efficiency of orbital energy transfer to the ce is parameterised by @xmath13 ( see hurley et al .",
    "the ce may be completely removed by orbital energy transfer to the envelope .",
    "observational evidence for this is in the existence of close double degenerate binaries such as 4u1820 - 30 or b2303 + 46 ( church et al .",
    "2006 ) which are thought to have achieved their close orbits via previous orbital energy loss to a ce .",
    "estimates of @xmath13 vary from less than 1 up to about 3 , with @xmath99 possible if energy sources other than orbital energy are involved ( hurley et al .",
    "if @xmath13 is large then energy is more easily transferred to the ce until it becomes unbound .",
    "conversely , if the transfer of orbital energy to the ce is less efficient , then the ce may be bound for longer , giving the stellar orbits time to decay by various means , which is more likely to lead to coalescence ( church et al .",
    "however , if orbital energy transfer is too inefficient this essentially removes one of the potential orbital decay mechanisms for the binary , leading to fewer sneia via coalescence .",
    "another parameter relating to ce evolution is @xmath15 , a dimensionless factor inversely proportional to the initial binding energy of the ce ( @xcite ) .",
    "this parameter is important since it affects the amount of energy that can be transferred to the ce before it becomes unbound .",
    "this affects the closeness of the two stellar cores remaining after the ce is lost .",
    "a value of @xmath94 was used in hurley et al .",
    "and we test this value compared to our baseline model described in section  [ yield - calculations ] .",
    "tests 3 and 4 show that the effect on line strengths of changing the common envelope parameters by setting either @xmath100 or @xmath94 is about one third of the observational uncertainty and at most of the same order as the observational uncertainty .",
    "therefore uncertainties in the values of common - envelope parameters , and their effects on sneia yields , can normally be neglected in gce models of line - strengths in integrated stellar populations .",
    "we now ask if there is a significant difference between using the baseline model yields ( dominated by sub-@xmath6 elds ) and yields from @xmath6 sneia scaled up to eject the same total mass ( at @xmath101 ) .",
    "the results are shown in test  5 .",
    "the @xmath6 yields differ in both composition and rate from the sub-@xmath6 yields , yet the maximum difference between the line strengths in both models was only of the order of the observational uncertainties with rms differences of only half the observational uncertainty .",
    "therefore it is difficult to distinguish between @xmath6 and sub-@xmath6 sneia from integrated spectral line strengths .",
    "however , the timing of sneia is important and our current models indicate that snia yields may contribute to galactic chemical evolution earlier than expected .",
    "test  6 shows that the effect of removing sneia altogether is rather large , up to @xmath102 @xmath103 the typical observational errors .",
    "clearly this is detectable .",
    "the primordial collapse models ( pc1 and pc2 ) showed smaller differences because in those cases sneia do not have much time to make an impact before star formation stops .",
    "this test illustrates the importance of including snia yields to correctly interpret observed line strengths in galaxies",
    ".    observed snia rates in galaxies cover about a factor of two in range ( * ? ? ? * their table  5 ) .",
    "models with double the baseline snia contribution were generated with proportions given by test  7 in table  [ table - snia - tests ] .",
    "differences were found to be up to twice the typical observational uncertainties so in principle may be detectable for some lines , such as iron - sensitive lines .",
    "smaller differences were again found for the primordial models .",
    "the iron sensitive line - strengths are slightly stronger for the doubled snia case compared with the baseline case ( up to 4% of the line - strengths themselves , and not very sensitive to the exact sfh ) .",
    "this is in the sense expected , since sneia contribute iron to the cosmic cycle .",
    "test  8 shows the effect of including a disk wind to stabilise accretion . in our models , this is achieved by allowing high mass accretion rates to lead to a snia , in order to test possible snia routes first described by @xcite and subsequent work by those authors . as in tests 6 and 7",
    ", this shows that the line strengths are most strongly affected by the rate of sneia .",
    "the largest differences were found in models with late bursts , as expected from the delayed snia contributions in these models .",
    "we have shown , using our chemical evolution models , that varying parameters that affect the number and type of sneia has a greater impact on line strengths than inclusion or exclusion of yields from other binary stars .",
    "this highlights the need to focus on the effects of different snia models in gce codes .",
    "the effects of other binary yields ( including common - envelope systems that do not become snia , cvs , novae etc ) can largely be ignored , unless specific , low abundance isotopes , such as @xmath104c or @xmath105n are being studied @xcite . for most gce applications , where abundances of fe , mg , c , ca and overall metallicity have the largest impact on line strengths , it is not so necessary to include additional binary yields other than from sneia explosions .",
    "the effects of additional binary yields other than sneia explosions are smaller than the observational uncertainties on line - strengths .",
    "this answers our original question in that we do not find that it is necessary to include effects of other binary processes besides sneia explosions in gce models of integrated stellar populations in galaxies .",
    "this may change if a factor of about three improvement in signal - to - noise occurs in line - strengths , based on a new , more accurate calibration system than the lick star data .",
    "we can see from table  [ table - snia - tests ] that overpopulating with sneia ( test  8) or excluding sneia altogether ( test  6 ) makes the biggest difference to predicted line strengths and these are clearly unrealistic and testable .",
    "after that , the rate and type of sneia are important .",
    "the adopted treatment of common envelope evolution makes a small difference , but less than the observational uncertainties in line strengths .",
    "@xcite tested the effects of a more bimodal snia rate distribution , using analytical forms , including prompt sneia ( @xmath106 yr ) and tardy sneia ( up to 10 gyr ) components .",
    "they predicted snia rates and yields for specific sfhs .",
    "they found , for ellipticals modelled as early , primordial bursts , that the exact snia rate distribution had little effect on snia rates at late times .",
    "our binary - star yields do include a prompt snia ( @xmath106 yr ) and a tardy ( continuing ) snia contribution for both elds and @xmath6 snia types ( see figure  [ fig-4 ] ) .",
    "observational evidence for short ( @xmath10770 myr ) and long ( few gyr ) snia delay times is given by @xcite , who look at delay timescales of sneia following star formation epochs , in a large sample of galaxies .",
    "by contrast , @xcite find that no progenitor model can be ruled in or out with current data .",
    "we find that he wd progenitors for sneia may have a small effect in gce models , however there is as yet no observational evidence for these , therefore they are largely ignored in this work .",
    "if real , their timescales for contributions may be longer than other sneia , due to the low mass progenitors involved .    forcing the baseline snia yields to originate from @xmath6 cowds only , by only including scaled - up versions of those contributions led to relatively small differences in line strengths compared to our baseline model . therefore , whether we model sneia as elds or standard @xmath6 cowds makes surprisingly little difference to predicted line - strengths in the models now .",
    "however , the yields do show larger variations with time , which might be detectable in resolved stellar populations .",
    "thus for the snia explosions themselves , gce modelling of integrated populations does not appear to distinguish well between elds and standard sneia .      finally , we consider what the implications are for single ssp fitting .",
    "fitting one ssp to spectral line strengths in order to recover luminosity weighted average ages and compositions is now a widely used technique in galaxy evolution studies .",
    "this usually involves a look - up table of ssps on a grid of values in age , metallicity and sometimes abundance ratio parameter space .",
    "the grid spacing we use in our ssp fitting routines ( based on tmk04 ssps and code written by robert proctor ) is 0.025 in log(age ) and log(@xmath33 ) , with coarser grid spacing for abundance ratio .",
    "this translates to @xmath108 differences between adjacent grid points in age and metallicity .",
    "thus the 2% to 7% lower @xmath33 in composite populations including other binaries ( seen in fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] , @xmath33% panels ) gives rise to one grid spacing lower in luminosity weighted average metallicity ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "for luminosity weighted average ages we find no difference between estimates from line strengths with or without other binaries .",
    "the time of the latest starburst ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] , sfh panels ) is approximately recovered in most cases , with no systematic differences for fits to line strength with or without other binaries . in the case of the model pc2",
    ", the average age is estimated at 8.4 gyr in each case , whereas the stars in that model really formed between 13.7 and 12.2 gyr ago .",
    "this highlights the fact that ssp fitting is far more strongly affected by aspects other than the effects of other binaries besides snia .",
    "the fact that average age estimates are not affected by other binaries is a bit surprising , given that all the balmer indices are stronger when the yields from other binaries are included ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "however , the stronger balmer indices are offset by other age sensitive features which are systematically weaker ( e.g. g4300 ) and it is important to remember that the balmer indices do have some sensitivity to metallicity as well - for a given age , they are stronger at lower metallicity .    thus average age estimates are unaffected by yields from other binaries ( such as common envelope systems , cvs and novae ) whilst average metallicities are slightly reduced ( by @xmath109 ) in populations accounting for yields from these other binaries .",
    "differences in snia types are likely to produce larger effects , but sneia are as yet too poorly understood to address this issue with any accuracy .",
    "future work to uncover the progenitors of sneia will help to address this large uncertainty in galactic chemical evolution modelling . from our present study",
    "we can say that other binaries aside from sneia have only a small effect on integrated spectra of galaxies and so do not normally need to be incorporated to interpret galaxy ages and metallicities .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the effects of yields from binary stars on spectral line strengths in integrated stellar populations . to do this",
    "we combined a single-/binary - star population model , which predicts yields as a function of time , with a galactic chemical evolution code that self - consistently models the spectral line strengths from integrated populations with different star formation histories .",
    "our tested sfhs included stars more than @xmath110gyr old up to 13.7gyr ( table  [ sfh - table ] ) .",
    "derived line strengths for various assumed binary - star contributions were compared to a baseline model .",
    "the resulting differences were compared to typical observational uncertainties on line strengths , in order to illustrate the relative importance of the various contributions and binary effects .",
    "we find the following :    * populations including other binary star processes as well as sneia produce slightly less metal than a population consisting of single stars with sneia .",
    "this affects magnesium and carbon sensitive spectral features most and iron sensitive features least ( figs .",
    "[ fig-1 ] and [ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "hydrogen absorption lines are slightly enhanced in populations with other binaries . however , the differences are all less than @xmath111 typical observational uncertainties on line - strengths . * therefore galactic chemical evolution models of unresolved stellar populations , using lick spectral indices , do not need to incorporate yields from binary stars other than snia explosions because other binary processes ( such as cvs , novae , symbiotic stars and various common envelope binaries ) do not significantly alter the strengths of observed spectral features . * parameters describing common envelope evolution",
    "affect the number of sneia . varying these parameters ( e.g. efficiency of orbital energy transfer to the ce ) affected observed line strengths by up to the observational errors in the current simulations",
    ". therefore these effects are also quite small ( less than or equal to observational errors ) . *",
    "the exact nature of the explosion ( e.g. sub-@xmath6 or @xmath6 cowd ) makes less difference than the rate of sneia and the time variation of that rate .",
    "* reductions in observational errors by about a factor of three are needed for line strengths to be sensitive to yields from other binary stars besides sneia , or the effects of ce evolution , within the bounds of currently acceptable parameters . on the other hand , current measurements of line strengths",
    "are already sensitive to the rates and timescales of sneia .",
    "however , they are also at least as sensitive to uncertainties in massive star evolution .",
    "* luminosity weighted average ages are unaffected by yields from other binaries and luminosity weighted average metallicities are decreased by less than @xmath112 due to yields from other binaries .",
    "this study makes a preliminary investigation into the expected contributions of different snia types to the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "the different timescales of snia versus snii enrichment forms a vital argument in our understanding of galaxy evolution from composite stellar populations .",
    "thus , understanding the evolution , timescales and chemical contributions of different types of sneia is fundamental for accurate gce modelling .",
    "therefore it is important in future work to further explore the accuracy and effects of snia models and their relative contributions in galaxies .",
    "our theoretical yields indicate prompt ( @xmath113yr ) as well as longer timescale contributions from sneia ( fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have looked at the effects on spectral absorption line - strengths of varying assumptions about the contributions of yields from different types of binary stars , in chemical evolution models of galaxies . in future work",
    "we will continue to improve our yield models , guided by observational results ( e.g. from superwasp , corot , gaia and other variability and radial velocity surveys ) . as more detailed modelling of individual elements become available we will also look at the effects on line strength of individual heavy elements such as carbon , which shows the largest differences in line - strengths , due to inclusion of different binary star processes other than sneia .",

    "parameterisation of the sfh used in our current gce models is aimed at covering as wide a range of types of composite galaxy histories as possible with a minimum number of free parameters .",
    "we also want to specify the latest major burst in some detail because more recent star formation has a large effect on the luminosity , colours and integrated spectral properties of the composite stellar population . since an ssp is typically described by three parameters ( age , @xmath114}}$ ] , @xmath35}}$ ] )",
    "we need more than three parameters to describe a composite sfh .",
    "empirical fitting of two ssps typically takes six parameters .",
    "we aim to improve on that , to describe more realistic continuous sfhs . for a gce model incorporating a sfh",
    ", we have additional constraints of self - consistency , which arise naturally from the model .",
    "therefore the free parameters are different from the ssp case .",
    "they do not describe the attributes of the stellar population directly , but instead describe the star formation efficiency and gas flow properties as a function of time .",
    "the early star formation is parameterised by a star formation efficiency ( * c@xmath115 * ) and a gas flow rate ( * f@xmath115 * ) . to describe early star formation , plus details of a late ( optional ) burst , we allow for two interruptions to the history at times t@xmath116 .",
    "these times are represented by * t@xmath75 * and t@xmath76 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ sfh - schematic ] .",
    "t@xmath75 can occur anywhere in the range @xmath117t@xmath118 gyr , i.e. 1.5 gyr ago or older in the current work , assuming an age of the universe of 13.7 gyr .",
    "the duration of the latest burst is then * d@xmath75*=t@xmath76-t@xmath75 , as in table  [ sfh - table ] .",
    "star formation efficiency ( * c@xmath75 * ) and gas flow rate ( * f@xmath75 * ) are both set as free parameters at t@xmath75 .",
    "then at t@xmath76 the star formation and gas flow are switched off ( by fixing c@xmath76=0 and f@xmath76=0 ) because we are not attempting to model systems with recent or ongoing star formation .",
    "the ssps used in this current work are 1.5 gyr or older , so this is the limit of how young we model stars .",
    "this gives us six parameters ( the ones given in bold above ) that can be varied to describe a wide range of histories much more realistically than two ssps ( which also requires 6 parameters as mentioned above ) .",
    "[ sfh - schematic ] illustrates the sfh parameters described , along with a time sequence covering the age of the universe .",
    "we are not sensitive to the exact age of the oldest stars because a population that is @xmath6410 gyr old looks very similar to one that is @xmath6414 gyr old in its spectrum and colours .",
    "however we are still sensitive to the burst duration in old populations , through abundance ratios .",
    "utilizing the six parameters described above we can explore histories ranging from early collapse ( such as models pc1 and pc2 in table  [ sfh - table ] ) , early star formation plus a later burst ( such as models lb1 , lb2 and mmw in table  [ sfh - table ] ) , through to continuous star formation ending recently .",
    "the latter models are not explored here for modelling effects of binary stars in luminous early - type galaxies because @xmath35}}$ ] ratios in these galaxies are not consistent with such models ( e.g. @xcite ; ps02 ) and these galaxies do not generally contain significant ongoing star formation .",
    "we estimate average uncertainties on line strengths from observations of early - type galaxies ( ps02 ; @xcite - dea05 in table  [ table - errors ] ; @xcite - s - b06 in table  [ table - errors ] ) acquired with @xmath119 class telescopes ( e.g. 17 e / s0 galaxies from ps02 , observed with the @xmath120 william herschel telescope ) .",
    "we include the data from ps02 for wavelengths above @xmath121 , below this the data are affected by dichroic response uncertainties .",
    "shorter than @xmath121 we use the data of @xcite who provide data on 98 early - type galaxies as observed with the william herschel telescope or the @xmath122 calar alto telescope .    at wavelengths",
    "longer than @xmath123 errors were obtained from observations of by @xcite .",
    "they catalogue 93 early - type galaxies observed with the @xmath124 telescope in mexico , so averages of their errors are scaled by a factor @xmath56 ( the ratio of line - strength errors from ps02 to dea05 in the spectral range @xmath125  to  @xmath126 ) . in this way , our line - strength errors are estimated from observations with the equivalent of a @xmath127 class telescope and a typical exposure time of @xmath128 to @xmath129 hours .",
    "deeper observations or the use of a larger telescope will not drastically reduce these errors , because they are dominated by systematic errors in the calibration to the lick scale rather than poisson errors ( e.g. see @xcite , their table  2 ; ps02 , their table  2 ; @xcite , their table  4 ) .",
