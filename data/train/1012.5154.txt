    "however , the lcls baseline @xcite is composed by a planar undulator system , which produces intense linearly polarized light in the wavelength range @xmath11 nm .",
    "for hard x - ray radiation ( shorter than @xmath12 nm ) , longitudinally coherent , linearly polarized x - rays can be obtained with the help of self - seeding techniques , and converted @xcite into any other elliptic polarization state by passing them through x - ray phase retarders @xcite . for soft x - ray wavelengths",
    "longer than @xmath12 nm , two main methods have been proposed to achieve circular polarization .",
    "the first consists in letting the electron beam through helical undulator devices .",
    "such devices @xcite are mechanically more complex than the simple , fixed gap planar undulator currently employed at the lcls , fig . [ lclspc7 ] . a second possibility , building on the work @xcite ,",
    "is constituted by the use of crossed planar undulators tuned at a different frequency than the fundamental , fig .",
    "[ lclspc8 ] .",
    "these options are discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly describe the first option .",
    "the option of a full - length helical undulator remains the most attractive in terms of quality of the output radiation .",
    "however , its realization is not foreseen at the first stage of the lcls project mainly due to technical challenges related to the production of long helical insertion devices .",
    "the choice of a relatively short helical undulator could initially constitute a reasonable compromise .",
    "it is not necessary that all the undulators in the line be helical , fig .",
    "[ lclspc7 ] .",
    "in fact , since the sase process already provides electron beam microbunching , the microbunches radiates coherently when passing through an helical undulator tuned at the same radiation wavelength . at the lcls , saturation of",
    "linearly polarized radiation at @xmath1 nm is reached after @xmath13 undulator modules .",
    "the saturation power is about @xmath4 gw . in order to reach",
    "more than @xmath5 degree of polarization , apple undulators need to be installed before the power reaches @xmath10 gw , i.e. in the fourth module @xcite .    considering the second option ,",
    "a short pair of crossed planar undulator is placed behind the long planar undulator , fig .",
    "[ lclspc8 ] .",
    "the radiation in the baseline undulator is characterized by a different frequency compared to the radiation in the crossed undulator , and thus has no effect on the polarization properties of the harmonic fields .",
    "the maximum circular degree of polarization achievable is over @xmath2 in the sase regime , and is insensitive to the length of the baseline undulator .",
    "a scheme was also presented in @xcite , where the crossed undulators are tuned to the fundamental . in this case , if the crossed undulator length is @xmath14 times the fel gain length , the two orthogonal linear components turn out to produce radiation with the same intensities and their combination results in circular polarization if their phase difference is equal to @xmath15 .",
    "the fel gain length , however , depends on a number parameters such as wavelength , peak current , emittance , energy spread , beta function .",
    "some of them might fluctuate leading to fluctuations of the degree of polarization as well .    in a coaxial setup where the baseline lcls undulator is followed by a short radiator tuned at the same wavelength",
    ", there is the issue of separation of linearly from circularly polarized radiation . in the option presented in @xcite ,",
    "after the planar undulator the electron beam is deflected by a bending system and subsequently passed through a helical undulator .",
    "the bending system serves to separate the linearly from the circularly polarized radiation .",
    "the polarization properties of the radiator in this scheme are completely independent of the light produced in the undulator providing the bunching of the electron beam . using this scheme , the electron beam microbunching on the scale of the soft x - ray radiation wavelength produced in the planar undulator",
    "must be maintained through the bending system , and this constitutes a challenge , which started to be addressed in literature only very recently .",
    "according to @xcite , such a scheme would be as long as 80 m.     of incident power by slits without spoiling of electron beam , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as a result only two main options were selected as candidates for the lcls upgrade , fig .",
    "[ lclspc7 ] and fig .",
    "[ lclspc8 ] . in this paper",
    "we propose a third option , fig .",
    "[ lclspc5 ] , which mainly consists sending the electron beam , after the passage in the baseline undulator , through a @xmath6 m long straight section , and subsequently through a short helical ( apple ii ) radiator .",
    "the background radiation from the baseline undulator is suppressed by letting radiation and electron beam through horizontal and vertical slits upstream the helical radiator , where the radiation spot size is about ten times larger than the electron bunch transverse size . using thin beryllium foils for the slits the divergence of the electron beam halo",
    "will be spoiled due to coulomb scattering , but the beam will propagate through the setup without electron losses .",
    "our method presents obvious advantages compared with the previously proposed ones . in all three cases",
    "one would obtain very high and stable degree of polarization , because all three options propose radical solutions of background problem .",
    "the option proposed in this paper , however , has advantages over the first one in terms of costs and time , not only because our helical undulator would be shorter , but also because we can afford to use the existing design of apple ii type undulators , improved for petra iii @xcite , instead of apple iii type undulators @xcite , which have not yet come into operation .",
    "comparing our technique with the crossed - undulator proposal , we have the advantage in terms of power and wavelength range . finally , to be specific here we restrict ourselves to the investigation of apple modules following the main undulator .",
    "however , our scheme can also operate with any helical radiator , including e.g. crossed planar undulators allowing for fast helicity switching .",

    "this thickness is enough to block the radiation from the first lcls undulator.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the electron beam first goes through the baseline undulator , producing sase radiation , and inducing energy and density modulation on the electron beam .",
    "this first step is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lclspc1 ] , where we also assume that the five second harmonic afterburner ( shab ) modules are rolled away @xcite from the beamline , fig .",
    "[ lclspc2 ] . in this way",
    ", we provide a total of @xmath6 m straight section for the electron beam , @xmath18 m corresponding to the shab modules , and further @xmath18 m corresponding to the straight section after the exit of the main undulator . at the end of the @xmath6 m - long straight section we install horizontal and vertical slits , and a @xmath19 m - long apple ii type undulator fig .",
    "[ lclspc4 ] .",
    "while passing through this last section , the microbunched electron beam produces intense bursts of radiation in any selected polarization state .",
    "however , one should account for the fact that the straight section acts as a dispersive element . therefore , in a klystron - like bunching effect should also be accounted for , which modifies the density modulation at the exit of the first undulator . from this viewpoint , the first ( baseline )",
    "lcls undulator behaves as an energy modulator , and the drift section , i.e. the straight section , transforms the energy into density modulation .",
    "following these lines , before discussing the result of numerical simulations , we present here a qualitative treatment of the influence of the propagation of electron beam through the drift section on the electron beam microbunching .    the way the electron bunch is modulated in an optical klystron is quantitatively described in e.g. @xcite .",
    "the current @xmath20 at the exit of the straight section is found to be a composition of harmonics of the fundamental frequency @xmath21 according to    @xmath22   j_n\\left(n p_0 \\frac{\\omega r_{56}}{c { e}_0}\\right)\\cr & & \\times \\cos\\left[n \\omega \\left(\\frac{z}{v_z}-t\\right)\\right]~ , \\label{czonca}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the energy modulation after the first undulator , @xmath24 is the nominal electron energy , @xmath25 is the local energy spread of electrons , @xmath26 is the longitudinal coordinate , @xmath27 is the longitudinal velocity of electrons and @xmath28 is the time .",
    "moreover @xmath29 indicates the bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath30 and , as before , @xmath31 is the momentum compaction factor .",
    "let us consider the first harmonic bunching in eq .",
    "( [ czonca ] ) , @xmath32 .",
    "we assume @xmath33 gev , a fundamental wavelength @xmath34 nm , a straight section length @xmath35 m and @xmath36 mev energy spread .",
    "we can estimate @xmath37 nm , with a relative rms energy spread of the @xmath38 .",
    "the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ czonca ] ) turns out to be about @xmath39 , i.e. reasonably near unity .",
    "this means that modulation is not destroyed by the passage through the straight section .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that this factor is energy dependent .",
    "in particular , increasing the energy will scale down the wavelength as @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the exponential factor scales as @xmath43 , so that for wavelength shorter than @xmath1 nm , which is the case under study in our numerical example , the suppression factor will be even smaller .    with the help of eq .",
    "( [ czonca ] ) we can estimate the maximal fel - induced energy modulation which can be tolerated in the electron beam after the baseline undulator .",
    "this can be done requiring that the argument of the bessel function in eq .",
    "( [ czonca ] ) be not larger than unity .",
    "this fixes the maximal value of @xmath44 . at saturation ,",
    "the energy modulation is comparable with the energy losses of the bunch , which is of the order of the relative bandwidth of the spectrum . in particular , for @xmath34 nm we have a bandwidth , and therefore , energy losses and energy modulation , in the order of @xmath45 .",
    "comparing with the maximal value of @xmath46 , we conclude that the planar undulator should work in the linear regime , and that the fel power yielded in the first part of our setup should be about ten times smaller than at saturation . numerical simulations ( see section [ sims ] ) , confirm these estimations .",
    "the influence of the betatron motion should be further accounted for .",
    "in fact , the finite angular divergence of the electron beam , linked with the betatron function , leads to an additional spread in the longitudinal velocity and as a consequence to an additional suppression factor in eq .",
    "( [ czonca ] ) .",
    "we can estimate this factor by comparison with the influence of the energy spread .",
    "the deviation in longitudinal velocity due to angular deviation is simply found as @xmath47 \\sim - v\\theta^2/2 $ ] .",
    "considering @xmath48 as the rms angular divergence we estimate @xmath49 , where @xmath50 m is the geometrical emittance and @xmath51 m is the average betatron function used at @xmath34 nm . since the effect of the energy spread @xmath25 over @xmath52 is @xmath53 , we conclude that the betatron motion should not constitute a serious problem .",
    "also note that if the focusing system is not varied with the energy , an energy increase results into a scaling of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and there is no energy dependence on the effects of the betatron motion .",
    "also note that the baseline undulator length is sufficient for operation at even higher betatron function in the order of @xmath56 m and in the drift section we are free to use , if needed higher betatron functions .",
    "the choice of @xmath51 m at @xmath1 nm , equal to the betatron function in the baseline is discussed here for simplicity only , since it is advantageous , for feasibility study purposes to assume that there is no significant difference in the betatron function along the @xmath18 m - long drift section and in the shab undulator focusing system . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the argument of the suppression factor due to the betatron motion effects goes with the square of the velocity spread yielding a dependence @xmath57 allowing for flexibility in the choice of @xmath58 .",
    "after the straight section , electron beam and radiation pass through horizontal and vertical slits , suppressing the linearly - polarized soft x - ray radiation from the lcls baseline undulator .",
    "since the slits are positioned 40 m downstream of the planar undulator , the radiation pulse has a ten times larger spot size compared with the electron bunch transverse size , and the background radiation power can therefore be diminished of two orders of magnitude , fig .",
    "[ lclspc3 ] .",
    "the slits can be made of beryllium foils , for a total thickness of @xmath59 m .",
    "the transmission for a @xmath59m - thick beryllium foil is shown in fig .",
    "[ transmb ] in the energy range between @xmath16 ev and @xmath17 ev . such a foil will block the radiation , but will let the electrons go through @xcite , fig .",
    "[ lclspc6 ] .",
    "thus , the advantage of the spoiling scheme is that radiation is attenuated of @xmath18 db , but while the halo of the electron bunch is allowed to propagate through the setup up to the beam dump without electron losses . in order to understand the effects of the foils on the electrons , we need to address multiple coulomb scattering in the foils . for estimations",
    ", we use the following formula used to calculate the rms electron beam angular divergence for the same electron beam :    @xmath60 \\sqrt{t / x0}~ , \\label{mulsc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the electron momentum in mev / c , @xmath28 is thickness of foil , and @xmath62 is the radiation length of the material . for beryllium , @xmath63 cm . for a thickness @xmath64 m , this amounts to @xmath65 mrad . assuming an electron beam size on the foil of @xmath66 m rms , which can be obtained by proper tuning of the focusing system",
    ", we obtain a spoiled emittance @xmath67 nm , corresponding to a normalized emittance @xmath68 m . such normalized emittance is well within the acceptance of the beamline optics . it should be noted that the emittance estimation is a conservative one , since only the electron beam halo , and not the main part of the beam , passes through the foils .",
    "the energy perturbation due radiation losses through the foils can be easily estimated as @xmath69 .",
    "we can also estimate influence of ionization losses .",
    "the ratio of losses to ionization losses is about @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the atomic number and @xmath72 is energy of the electron beam . for beryllium , @xmath73 and we have ratio of order @xmath18 , meaning that we can neglect ionization losses .    finally , it should be noted that in the particular case of the lcls baseline , we have an additional suppression of a few times for the linearly polarized radiation background , which we did not actually accounted for in our calculations for the degree of polarization , due to the fact that the first lcls undulator operates in the linear regime .",
    "following the previous section considering the method in detail and discussing estimations , here we present more detailed fel simulations with the help of the fel code genesis 1.3 @xcite running on a parallel machine .",
    "we present a statistical analysis consisting of @xmath74 runs .",

    "an optimum is found when only the last @xmath19 cells upstream of the shab are used .",
    "in other words we assume that first 23 baseline undulator modules are detuned . the power and spectrum after the baseline undulator",

    "such assumption can obviously be relaxed , and it is considered here for simplicity reasons only .",
    "also , the influence of the betatron motion on the microbunching is only estimated in the previous section , but is not explicitly accounted for in simulations . however , from previous estimations we expect that such influence would be even smaller than the influence due to the finite energy spread of the beam . moreover , as note before , the betatron function can be increased with respect to our choice , up to a value of @xmath76 m , decreasing the influence of the betatron motion on the microbunching . in this case",
