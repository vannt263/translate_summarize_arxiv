    "* - what are unified ?",
    "+ as one of the general features of the su(5 ) gut models , both yukawa coupling constants of the bottom - quark and the tau - lepton are unified at gut scale . additionally , in several su(5 )",
    "models including the _ susy _",

    "* - what is @xmath1 ?",
    "+ in the conventional analysis@xcite , the gauge unification in the susy su(5 ) gut model is achieved by introducing an energy - scale constant @xmath1 by - hand to decouple the lower energy - scale region from the effects of the supersymmetric particles .",
    "thus , @xmath1 is regarded as the threshold between the standard model(sm ) and susy .",
    "the value of @xmath1 depends on the strong coupling constant @xmath4 very sensitively@xcite .",
    "for instance , while @xmath5 1(tev ) for @xmath6 is given@xcite in 1991 , @xmath7 100(gev ) is obtained for the recent value@xcite of @xmath8 . if @xmath1 were really less than 100(gev ) , we should have already detected such supersymmetric particles in the region of @xmath9 100(gev ) experimentally , however we have not yet .",
    "this fact may allow us to think of @xmath1 as a negligible parameter , or , at least , the authors should discuss on the possibility of the models without @xmath1 .",
    "note that such model without @xmath1 means the pure supersymmetric theory without including the conventional standard model .",
    "* how much @xmath0 is optimal ?",
    "+ @xmath0 is evaluated by the two different ways of the likelihood analysis at two - loop level in this paper .",
    "one of the two ways is on the unification of the gauge coupling constants , and another is of the bottom - tau s yukawa coupling constants .",
    "the sequence to optimize @xmath0 is as follows : + in the first , @xmath1 and the gut scale @xmath10 are fixed by the @xmath11-fitting on the unification of the gauge@xmath12 coupling constants .",
    "once @xmath1 and @xmath10 are fixed , corresponding @xmath0 is derived numerically to realize the bottom - tau unification at @xmath10 scale .",
    "+ additionally , the analysis on the model without @xmath1 is also carried out in the same manner .",
