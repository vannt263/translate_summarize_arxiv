    "the detailed circuit diagram we use for our experiments is sketched in fig.s1 .",
    "all the electronic components for controlling the coupling are placed on a pcb ( printed circuit board ) that is shielded with a metal box .",
    "the output of the pcb goes to the electrical feedthroughs of the vacuum chamber in which the membrane - capacitor system is placed .",
    "the decay rate of the lc circuit is a crucial parameter for reaching the strong coupling regime since the coupling rate should exceed this rate . in our setup",
    ", we use a high - q ferrite inductor which is made of ferrite 61 material ( including a mixture of zinc and nickel ) that is known for minimized core and eddy current losses .",
    "the inductor is wound with litz wires of optimal wire diameter for low loss in the frequency range of interest ( @xmath137 khz ) . even though the q of our inductor reaches 500 around this frequency range , our combined circuit exhibits lower q due to several elements .",
    "we have observed that connection of the pcb ( dielectric losses ) and nearby magnetic elements ( optical table , shielding box etc ) contribute to the reduction of the q - factor .",
    "a significant reduction occurs when the whole lc circuit is connected to the membrane - capacitor chip inside the chamber .",
    "this comes mainly from the contact resistance ( @xmath138 @xmath139 ) of the gold electrode connection lines deposited on the capacitor chip .      in the mhz range ,",
    "antennas pick up radiation that permeate the earth s atmosphere , caused mainly by lightnings , but also man - made , and at higher frequencies , galactic sources @xcite .",
    "litz wires shielded with aluminium foil are used to reduce pick - up in the cables ( @xmath140 ) connecting the box containing the printed circuit board control unit with the inductor .",
    "the inductor / antenna is placed in a metal box to reduce the amplitude of the large atmospheric pickup in order to better demonstrate the sensitivity of the transducer .",
    "still , the radiation picked up generates voltages largely exceeding the johnson noise in the circuit .",
    "we have measured the scaling of the mechanically transduced pickup signals as a function of bias voltage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : excessnoise ] ) .",
    "the noise amplitude shows scaling which would be expected for a signal coupled through the inductor port according to our model .",
    "the nonlinear function used for the fit is described by @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a proportionality constant for @xmath143 .",
    "the function is derived from eq .",
    "( [ e : displacement ] ) for the case of resonant driving ( @xmath144 ) with the assumption that white noise ( @xmath85 ) is the dominant source throughout the relevant frequency range .",
    "the capacitive transducer in our setup consists of a 4-segment electrode and a metal coated membrane .",
    "microscope images of both the chip and the membrane are shown in fig.s3 .",
    "the chip has an area roughly four times larger than that of the membrane .",
    "the two pairs of segments are connected via extra electrodes such that the diagonal parts form ( + ) and ( - ) electrodes .",
    "we note that the overlap between the membrane area and the 4-segment electrodes after the assembly is not perfectly symmetric .",
    "the initial distance between the membrane and the capacitor chip is paramount in order to achieve high coupling rates at small dc bias voltages . for our setup ,",
    "the distance is set by the pillar height ( 600 nm and @xmath145 ) deposited on the glass chip . however , most membrane - chip samples showed distances of a few @xmath146 .",
    "this is attributed to the unevenness of the membrane and chip surface , as well as residues ( silicon , resist , dust ) acquired during the assembly process . to overcome this problem",
    ", we used an extra etching process for a batch of our membranes to remove a 50 @xmath146 thick layer of a large area within the membrane frame surface .",
    "this technique helped us reduce the distance closer to the pre - determined value .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : whitelight ] , the distance was experimentally determined using white light interferometry .",
    "after assembly of the membrane - electrode system , we typically measured the linewidth of the thermally driven mechanical mode using the optical readout .",
    "typically values of @xmath147 were observed . for some membranes",
    ", we used ringdown measurements for a more accurate determination of the mechanical quality factor .",
    "to that end , the membrane was excited through the capacitor using a small applied voltage .",
    "the membrane motion was again monitored optically , and its decay recorded after the excitation was switched off .",
    "figure [ fig : ringdown ] shows an example of such a measurement , with a fitted ( amplitude ) ringdown time of @xmath148 , corresponding to a linewidth of @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "when arranging the membrane very close to the electrode surface ( @xmath151 ) , we typically found a reduction of the membrane quality factor , with mechanical linewidths often on the order of @xmath152 .",
    "the precise origin of this increased damping sill has to be better understood , but could possibly arise from surface charge - membrane interaction or , for very small distances , residues getting in contact with the membrane .",
    "the increased damping limits the cooperativity in measurements with the highest coupling , such as the one shown in fig .  1 of the main manuscript .      in this section ,",
    "we explore the limits of our device based on the maximum achievable cooperativity .",
    "cooperativity ( @xmath153 ) is in principle limited by the maximum applicable dc voltage that yields a static displacement of the membrane towards the electrode direction .",
    "this voltage , known as the pull - in voltage for capacitive systems@xcite , can be calculated by using the scaling of the capacitive force ( @xmath154 ) and the equation @xmath155 at the equilibrium point , where @xmath89 and @xmath156 refer to the intrinsic spring constant and membrane - electrode distance , respectively .",
    "this expression for the electrostatically modified spring constant goes to zero if the membrane is displaced by @xmath157 due to the applied dc voltage , causing instability and eventual collapse of the membrane on the capacitor chip . considering this limit , we implement the following scaling argument for our experimental data in fig.4 . assuming a homogenous force and neglecting the deflection geometry of the membrane , frequency shift and static displacement",
    "can be related by @xmath158 which sets the maximum allowable frequency shift as @xmath159 khz where @xmath160 khz is the bare membrane frequency .",
    "given the empirically found frequency shift of 88 khz with 21v dc bias at a distance of @xmath161 m and the frequency shift scaling @xmath162 , the applied voltage can be increased by a factor of @xmath163 which leads to a 3 times improved cooperativity of @xmath164 . consequently , this would correspond to a sensitivity limit of 2.9 pv@xmath165 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath166 describes the electromechanical system in terms of the flux @xmath25 in the inductor , the charge @xmath26 on the capacitors , as well as the displacement @xmath27 and momentum @xmath28 of the considered fundamental membrane mode . in this scalar description",
    "the coupling arises due to the displacement dependence of the capacitance @xmath167 .",
    "the hamiltonian directly leads to the langevin equations @xmath168 in which the dissipation rate @xmath169 of the membrane , and @xmath170 of the resonance circuit have been included , as well as driving terms @xmath171 ( a force on the membrane ) and @xmath172 ( a voltage induced in the circuit ) .    assuming that the only acting force is the thermal langevin force @xmath173 , and writing the applied voltage as a large d.c .",

    "are on the order of @xmath229 .",
    "the response of the electromechanical systems to a series voltage picked up in the inductor ( port `` 2 '' ) , and measured within the circuit , at the capacitor ( port `` 1 '' ) , is described by eq .  ( [ e : mitcapacitor ] ) . here",

    "it turned out to be more robust to evaluate this ratio not at one particular frequency ( here e.  g.  @xmath245 ) , but throughout the entire measured frequency range .",

    "for the driven measurements with the lock - in ( in units of vrms ) , we implement the following approach to calibrate the readings to mechanical amplitudes ( shown in fig.2 ) .",
    "the membrane is first excited with a single frequency sine wave of known amplitude from the rf output of the lock - in via a drive coil .",

    "<S> the electrically measured response ( fig .  [ fig : mit]a ) clearly shows the signature of a mechanically induced transparency @xcite indicated by the dip in the @xmath13 resonance curve . </S>",
    "<S> independently , we observe the rf signal generated in the @xmath13 circuit optically via the membrane mechanical dynamics ( fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> in particular , the electromechanical coupling leads to broadening of the mechanical resonance , an electromechanical damping effect analogous to optomechanical dynamical backaction cooling @xcite , to a new effective linewidth @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the electromechanical cooperativity @xmath54 the width of the induced transparency dip and the mechanical linewidth grow in unison , and in agreement with our expectations as @xmath55 ( inset ) . </S>",

    "<S> our data analysis allows us to quantify the coupling strength in three independent ways , by ( i ) analysis of the mechanical responses spectral shape , ( ii ) comparison of the voltage and displacement modulation amplitudes , and ( iii ) the frequency shift @xcite of the mechanical mode , and compare these experimental values with ( iv ) a theoretical estimate taking the geometry of the electromechanical transducer into account ( si ) . for @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath64 following to the first method , and similar values using the three others ( cf .  </S>",

    "<S> we now turn to the performance of this interface as an rf - to - optical transducer </S>",
    "<S> . a relevant figure of merit for the purpose of bringing small signals onto an optical carrier is the voltage @xmath72 required at the input of the series circuit in order to induce an optical phase shift of @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> achieving minimal @xmath72 requires a tradeoff between strong coupling and induced mechanical damping . </S>",
    "<S> for the optimal cooperativity @xmath74 we find @xmath75 at resonance @xmath76 , orders of magnitude below commercial modulators optimised for decades by the telecom industry , but also explorative microwave photonic devices @xcite based on electronic nonlinearities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to relate this performance to more fundamental entities , namely the electromagnetic field s quanta that constitute the signal . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it is possible to show that the _ quantum _ conversion efficiency , defined here as the ratio of optical sideband photons to the rf quanta extracted from the source @xmath77 for @xmath78 , is given by ( see si ) @xmath79 this corresponds to the squared effective lamb - dicke parameter @xmath80 enhanced by the number of photons sampling the membrane during the membrane excitations lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested that the membranes can support optical readout powers of more than @xmath81 without degradation of their ( intrinsic ) linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> we thus project that conversion efficiencies on the order of @xmath82 are available . </S>",
    "<S> so far we have measured a few percent in the laboratory , with further experiments ongoing . note </S>",
    "<S> that this transducer constitutes a phase - insensitive amplifier , and can thus reach conversion efficiencies above one  at the expense of added quantum noise .    for the recovery of classical signals , </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity and bandwidth of the interface is of greatest interest . </S>",
    "<S> the signal at the optical output of the device is the interferometrically measured spectral density of the optical phase @xmath83 of the light reflected off the membrane , @xmath84 the voltage @xmath85 at the input of the resonance circuit ( denoted here as its spectral density @xmath86 ) is transduced to a phase shift via the circuit s susceptibility @xmath87 , the coupling @xmath60 , the effective membrane susceptibility @xmath88 and the optical wavenumber @xmath89 ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity is determined by the noise added within the interface . </S>",
    "<S> this includes in particular , the imprecision in the phase measurement ( @xmath90 ) , but also the random thermal motion of the membrane induced by the langevin force ( @xmath91 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the former depends on the performance of the employed interferometric detector and can be quantum - limited ( @xmath92 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this transduction scheme by measuring the ambient rf radiation background @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this radiation induces a voltage @xmath85 on the order of @xmath93 in the circuit , as we can determine through an electrical measurement on port ` 1 ' . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we measure this signal optically , as shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : sens]a .     * voltage sensitivity and noise . * ( * a * ) optical measurent of ambient rf radiation ( red ) with a signal - to - noise ratio of nearly @xmath94 . the sharp peak at @xmath95 is due to calibration with a known phase modulation . </S>",
    "<S> thick lines show models for the total signal ( @xmath96 , blue ) , with contributions from the rf radiation ( @xmath97 , violet ) , the optical quantum phase noise ( @xmath98 , yellow ) , and membrane thermal noise ( @xmath99 , green ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( * b * ) data and models as in ( a ) , but divided by the interface s response function @xmath100 , and thus referenced to the voltage @xmath22 induced in the antenna . ]    in this experiment , we use a home - built interferometer operated at @xmath101 and with a light power of @xmath102 returned from a thicker membrane ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) . optical quantum ( shot ) noise limits the phase sensitivity to @xmath106 , corresponding to membrane displacements of @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be translated to a voltage sensitivity limit by division with the total input - output transfer function @xmath108 of the transducer . </S>",
    "<S> values as low as @xmath109 are achieved within the resonant bandwidth of this proof - of - principle transducer ( yellow curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sens]b ) . with improved detection ( probing power @xmath110 , unity visibility ) , this number reduces to @xmath111 . evidently , yet </S>",
    "<S> more sensitive optomechanical transduction could readily be achieved with known systems @xcite . the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sens ] corresponds to a measurement with about @xmath112 dynamic range , and we still expect a significant margin towards the onset of mechanical nonlinearities , which were observed to occur only as the displacement amplitudes are approaching nm - levels , corresponding to an expected dynamic range of @xmath113 for broadband signals . the noise added by the membrane thermal agitation is more critical in nature , as it can usually only be reduced using cryogenic cooling . remarkably , however , this noise is strongly suppressed in this setting . </S>",
    "<S> if recast into an equivalent input voltage noise @xmath114 , this contribution is found as low as @xmath115 at resonance , where @xmath3 is the temperature of the _ membrane_. thus the noise added by the membrane , as seen by the optical readout , has a temperature of only @xmath116 . for the data of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sens ] , we have obtained a cooperativity of @xmath117 with a bias voltage of @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding noise temperature of @xmath119 should therefore allow to recover signals down to a level of @xmath4 over a bandwidth of @xmath120 ( green curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sens]b ) .    for comparison , the ultralow - noise operational amplifier arrangement , which we use to measure on port ` 1 ' has a nominal voltage noise of @xmath121 and negligible current noise ; in practice , with a gain of @xmath122 , we achieve an input noise ( at port ` 1 ' ) of @xmath123 . referenced again to the voltage @xmath22 driving the circuit , this translates to a voltage sensitivity of @xmath124 , to be compared with the current shot - noise limited @xmath109 of our device and its @xmath4 membrane noise . </S>",
    "<S> this superior performance of our transducer remains unchanged also off resonance ( @xmath125 ) as both methods benefit equally from the @xmath13-circuit s resonant enhancement of the signal voltage @xmath22 ( cf .  fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup]b ) .    further improved sensitivity is readily available , not least due to the still considerable margin for increasing the cooperativity : the pull - in instability of the membrane is estimated to occur only at @xmath126 , and @xmath127 in the present system ( see si ) . within the stability regime , </S>",
    "<S> stronger coupling , and correspondingly higher cooperativities , can be achieved by reducing the offset capacitance @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> the ultimate noise floor of our opto - mechanical transducer is well below the room temperature johnson noise from the circuit s @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> our ultralow - noise transducer / amplifier can therefore be of particular relevance in applications where this noise is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for direct electronic ( quantum ) signal transduction , the resonance circuit must be overloaded with a cold transmission line which carries the signal of interest . in radio astronomy @xcite , highly efficient antennas looking at the cold sky </S>",
    "<S> have noise temperatures in the ghz range significantly below room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the usually required cryogenically cooled pre - amplifiers might be replaced by our transducer . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in nuclear - magnetic resonance experiments including imaging , cooled pickup circuits can deliver a significant sensitivity improvement , yet this approach is challenging current amplifier technology @xcite . for applications with the centre radio - frequency in the ghz band strong electro - mechanical coupling to the membrane in the mhz range </S>",
    "<S> can be achieved by using an oscillating coupling voltage @xcite instead of the dc voltage used in the present work .    </S>",
    "<S> the capacitor is fabricated by standard cleanroom microfabrication techniques . </S>",

    "<S> the mechanical resonator consists of a 50  nm thick aluminum layer on top of a high - stress stoichometric sin layer with a thickness of 100  nm and 180  nm for different samples . </S>",
    "<S> the al layer is deposited on top of the whole wafer after the membranes have been released . </S>",
    "<S> photolithography and chemical etching are subsequently used to remove the metal from the anchoring regions and from a circle in the middle of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the metal layer on sin causes roughly a 10 percent decrease in the eigenfrequency of the fundamental mode . </S>",
    "<S> optical interferometry is carried out via a commercial doppler vibrometer ( msa-500 polytec ) and by a home made michelson interferometer ( for the data set in fig.4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the vibrometer uses optical heterodyne detection of the light returned from the membrane to recover the displacement spectrum of the membrane s surface . </S>",
    "<S> the membrane - electrode distance is determined using the white light interferometry functionality of the same device . </S>",

    "<S> the beams are re - combined and the relative phase measured with a high - bandwidth ( 0 - 75mhz ) ingaas balanced - homodyne receiver . </S>",
    "<S> shot noise limited measurement with an overall quantum efficiency of @xmath136 ( losses , visibility , detector efficiency ) is achieved . </S>",
