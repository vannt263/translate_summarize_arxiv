    "prussian blue analogs , a class of molecular - based magnetic materials , are of high interest due to a relatively easy control of their magnetic properties during a synthesis process through the selection of desired spin sources .",
    "these compounds exhibit some remarkable properties ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) , such as a photoinduced magnetic pole inversion , a compensation or multicompensation behaviour , or an anomalous thermal dependence of the susceptibility as the compensation temperature approaches the critical one .",
    "in particular , an example of the compensation behaviour is the prussian blue analog of the type @xmath2 @xmath3\\cdot n { \\rm h}_2 { \\rm o}$ ] , which includes both ferromagnetic ( @xmath4 ) and antiferromagnetic  ( @xmath5 ) superexchange interactions through the cyanide bridging ligands .",
    "this so called ternary metal compound , besides a critical temperature , exhibits a compensation temperature for some range of the mixing ratio @xmath6 of the metal ions , and an unusual behaviour of the susceptibility as the two temperatures merge  @xcite .",
    "thus , the compensation behaviour results from a proper selection of the parameter @xmath6 , and its actual value also quantitatively affects the magnitudes of the critical and compensation temperatures .",
    "we note that the compensation behaviour , with important technological applications in the field of magneto - optic recording , is possible due to different temperature dependencies of the sublattice magnetizations .    due to their structural complexity",
    ", the theoretical investigations of the prussian blue analogs have been mostly limited to a mean - field theory ( mft ) treatment @xcite or an effective - field theory ( eft ) approach @xcite , but also monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite and exact recursion relations on the bethe lattice @xcite have recently been employed . however , in the previous mc studies only simplified models of the prussian blue analogs , consisting of a fixed spatial configuration of the spins placed on two equivalent ( @xmath7 stoichiometry ) interpenetrating sublattices , were considered . furthermore , either lattice geometry ( @xcite ) , spin values ( @xcite ) , or both ( @xcite ) did not correspond to the compound of our current interest . therefore , the main goal of the present paper is to focus on a spin system corresponding to the prussian blue analog @xmath1 \\cdot n { \\rm h_2o}$ ] , which can be modeled by a three - dimensional @xmath0 ternary alloy on a cubic lattice with a @xmath8 stoichiometry , consisting of three different ising spins @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and the superexchange interaction ratio @xmath12 @xcite",
    ". we also take into account fluctuations resulting from different spatial distributions of magnetic and non - magnetic sites .",
    "further , we study how magnetic properties of the ternary metal compound are modified when the parameter @xmath13 and the stoichiometry of the system are changed .",
    "the mixed ferro - ferrimagnetic ternary alloy model of the type @xmath0 is described by the hamiltonian @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 @xmath16 for @xmath17 ions , @xmath18 for @xmath19 ions , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath16 for @xmath22  ions .",
    "@xmath23  is a random variable which takes the value of unity ( zero ) if the site @xmath24 is occupied by the @xmath17 ion ( vacant ) , and @xmath25  is a random variable which takes the value of unity ( zero ) if the site @xmath26 is occupied by the @xmath19 @xmath27 ion . to be consistent with the structure of the above - mentioned prussian blue analog",
    "we also assume that the couplings between nearest neighbours include both the ferromagnetic ( @xmath28 ) and the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath29 ) interactions .",
    "a simulated @xmath30 lattice consists of two interpenetrating face - centered cubic sublattices , each one comprising @xmath31 sites .",
    "the @xmath17 ions , which are randomly distributed on one sublattice with the concentration @xmath32 , are alternately connected with the @xmath19 or @xmath22 ions , which are randomly located on the other sublattice with the concentration @xmath6 or @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "thus , each @xmath17 ion is coupled with six nearest - neighbouring ions of the type @xmath34 ( @xmath35 or @xmath22 ) , while the ions of the type @xmath34 have on average only four nearest neighbours of the type @xmath17 .",
    "this arrangement reflects the 3:2 stoichiometry of the system .",
    "it should be stressed that in the previous mc studies @xcite the real structure of the prussian blue analogs was not taken into account .",
    "we consider linear lattice sizes @xmath36 ranging from @xmath37 up to @xmath38 with the periodic boundary conditions imposed .",
    "initial spin states are randomly assigned and the updating follows the metropolis dynamics .",
    "the lattice structure and the short range of the interactions enable vectorization of the algorithm . since the spins on one sublattice interact only with the spins on the other , each sublattice can be updated simultaneously .",
    "thus one sweep through the entire lattice involves just two sublattice updating steps . for thermal averaging , we consider up to @xmath39 mc sweeps in the standard and up to @xmath40 mc sweeps in the histogram mc simulations , discarding the first @xmath41% of the total number for thermalization .",
    "finally , configurational averaging is performed over @xmath42 ( typically 10 or 20 ) spatial configurations .",
    "then the errors of the calculated quantities are determined from the values obtained for those configurations .",
    "namely , the error bars in all the figures presented below will represent twice of the standard deviations .",
    "we calculate the sublattice magnetization per site @xmath43 = \\bigg[\\frac{2}{l^3 } \\bigg\\langle \\bigg|\\sum_{i=1}^{n_a}s_{i}^{a}\\bigg| \\bigg\\rangle\\bigg],\\ ] ]    @xmath44 = \\bigg[\\frac{2}{l^3 } \\bigg\\langle \\bigg|\\sum_{j=1}^{n_b}s_{j}^{b}\\bigg| \\bigg\\rangle\\bigg],\\ ] ]    @xmath45 = \\bigg[\\frac{2}{l^3 } \\bigg\\langle -\\bigg|\\sum_{j=1}^{n_c}s_{j}^{c}\\bigg| \\bigg\\rangle\\bigg],\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the number of @xmath17 ions ( @xmath47 ) on one sublattice and @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the numbers of @xmath19 and @xmath22 ions ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) on the other sublattice , and @xmath52 denotes thermal and @xmath53 $ ] configurational averages .",
    "the total magnetization per site is defined as @xmath54=\\bigg[\\bigg\\langle\\frac{1}{2}(m_a+m_b+m_c)\\bigg\\rangle\\bigg]= \\frac{1}{2}(m_a+m_b+m_c)\\ ] ] and the staggered magnetization per site is given by @xmath55=\\bigg[\\frac{1}{l^3}\\bigg\\langle\\bigg|\\sum_{(i , j)}(s_i^a+s_j^b - s_j^c)\\bigg|\\bigg\\rangle\\bigg].\\ ] ] the corresponding direct and staggered susceptibilities per site @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , are given by @xmath58,\\ ] ] and @xmath59.\\ ] ] finally , the specific heat per site @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61.\\ ] ]    in the histogram mc simulations , developed by ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite , we perform longer runs at a chosen temperature and calculate the energy histogram @xmath62 , the order parameters histograms @xmath63  @xmath64 , as well as the physical quantities ( [ magn_a])@xmath65([spec_heat ] ) . using data from the histograms",
    "one can calculate physical quantities at neighbouring temperatures , and thus determine the values of extrema of various quantities and their locations with high precision for each lattice size .",
    "in such a way we can obtain quality data for finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis .",
    "the extrema of the direct and staggered susceptibilities at a second - order transition are known to scale with the lattice size as @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 represent the correlation length and susceptibility critical exponents , respectively , pertaining to the order parameter @xmath69 .",
    "the critical temperature of the current model can be considerably affected by the values of the exchange ratio @xmath13 and the concentration @xmath6 .",
    "phase diagrams in a wide range of the @xmath70 parameter space are estimated based on monitoring of the positions of the ( critical ) maxima in different thermodynamic quantities , such as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath60 .",
    "due to the extensive coverage it would be computationally too demanding to perform the fss analysis in each considered point of the @xmath70 plane to determine the critical temperatures with high precision .",
    "therefore , we estimate the values of @xmath71 from the peaks positions of @xmath57 for a fixed value of @xmath36 , i.e. , we determine the pseudocritical temperature @xmath72 .",
    "after checking in a few selected points we chose the value of @xmath73 above which the values of @xmath72 do not tend to change significantly . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - r ] , we show dependence of such estimated critical temperature on @xmath13 for some selected values of @xmath6 .     for selected values of the concentration @xmath6 .",
    "the dash - doted lines are guides for the eye and the dotted line marks an approximate location of @xmath74 . above and below the crossing point , the crossing points for the systems with @xmath7 and @xmath75 stoichiometries , respectively , are marked . ]",
    "the limiting cases of @xmath76 and @xmath77 correspond to the binary mixed systems @xmath78 with spins @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and @xmath81 with spins @xmath79 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "while , the latter binary system is not affected by the parameter @xmath13 and gives a flat line , the former one gives the transition line with the steepest gradient .",
    "further , from the figure it can be seen that all the curves appear to intersect in a single point corresponding to the critical value @xmath83 . by closer inspection of the intersection area for various lattice sizes",
    "we locate @xmath74 , a value surprisingly close to that obtained by mft , @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "this finding comes surprising particularly in the light of the fact that the @xmath85 value does not depend on the coordination numbers ( numbers of nearest neighbours ) in the respective sublattices , while the current approach accounts for the system s 3:2 stoichiometry .",
    "this prompted us to check the value of @xmath83 in our system with different stoichiometries .",
    "in the considered cases of @xmath7 ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath8 ( @xmath32 ) , and @xmath75 ( @xmath87 ) stoichiometries we find that the critical temperatures decrease with decreasing @xmath88 ( hence , decreasing overall coordination number ) , however , the respective values of @xmath83 are indistinguishable within the current precision . moreover , they are very close to the value obtained by the mc simulations on a two - dimensional system @xcite .",
    "these results indicate very little or no sensitivity of the value of @xmath83 to the lattice stoichiometry , supporting the mft results . however , the value of the corresponding critical temperature obtained by the mc approach is considerably lower than that obtained by mft .",
    "for example , in the system with the @xmath8 stoichiometry the value of the critical temperature from the mc calculation is @xmath89 , while mft gives @xmath90 .",
    "the little sensitivity of the value of @xmath83 to the lattice stoichiometry can be understood considering the processes that the respective parameters control .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 controls the relative strength of the exchange interactions between @xmath17 ions and their neighbours on @xmath22 and @xmath19 sublattices . at @xmath83 , a kind of a balance sets in at which a mutual exchange of @xmath19 and @xmath22 ions does not affect the critical temperature of the system . on the other hand",
    ", the lattice stoichiometry ( controlled by the parameter @xmath88 ) relates solely to the concentration of @xmath17 ions .",
    "therefore , while the stoichiometry affects the overall coordination number and hence the magnitude of the critical temperature , it is not likely to affect the relative strength of the exchange interactions between the @xmath81 and @xmath78 sublattice pairs , i.e. the value of @xmath83 .    as we can observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - r ] , the transition temperature @xmath71 for the ternary systems with @xmath92 is always lower than that of the binary mixture @xmath81 and increases with increasing concentration @xmath6 , while the opposite trend is observed for @xmath93 .",
    "this behaviour of @xmath71 is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - p ] ,     for different values of @xmath13 . ]    in which the transition temperature is shown as a function of a varying concentration .",
    "the transition line with @xmath94 corresponds to the real compound @xmath2 @xmath3\\cdot n { \\rm h}_2 { \\rm o}$ ] @xcite and , as the fig .",
    "shows , due to its proximity to the value of @xmath83 , the critical temperature is little affected by the change of the mixing ratio @xmath6 .",
    "the transition curves merge at @xmath77 , for which the ternary system becomes the binary mixture @xmath81 , and therefore , @xmath13 becomes a redundant variable .",
    "an interesting situation arises at the low - concentration side for the vanishing value of @xmath13 .",
    "namely , the transition temperature decreases with the decrease of @xmath13 but as long as @xmath13 remains finite the phase transition occurs in the whole concentration range .",
    "the situation for @xmath95 corresponds to configurations involving  loose  ions of the types @xmath22 and @xmath17 with no mutual exchange interactions and their concentration increases with decreasing value of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , even though we do not deal with a problem of a dilution with non - magnetic impurities , the system involves a portion of spins that in the absence of the exchange interactions behave like non - magnetic atoms , since they are inactive in producing magnetic ordering .",
    "for this reason we can expect some `` percolation threshold '' @xmath96 below which no phase transition can occur .",
    "unfortunately , within the current approach it is computationally very demanding to locate the value of @xmath96 with a higher precision .",
    "the main reasons are extremely long thermalization times near @xmath96 , necessity to consider large lattice sizes , and to average over a large number of configurations .",
    "for instance , in our tests on individual configurations for @xmath97 , the equilibrium was not reached even after @xmath98 mc sweeps .",
    "nevertheless , from the observation of some physical quantities , as well as the finite - size scaling , it appears that the long - range ordering survives down to at least @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : c - t ] we show temperature dependence of the specific heat for @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , for the maximum linear size of @xmath103 , in order to suppress as much as possible the finite - size effects .",
    "the specific heat was chosen due to the fact that it exhibits much smaller fluctuations , and hence `` smoother '' behaviour , than the susceptibility . while the curves for @xmath100 and @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ fig : c - t ] display well - defined sharp maxima , typical for a second - order phase transition , only a broad maximum is observed for @xmath104 .    , @xmath103 , and different values of @xmath6 .",
    "]     and @xmath104 . ]",
    "to see qualitative difference between the anomalies in the physical quantities for @xmath99 and @xmath102 , we additionally performed fss analysis of the direct susceptibility @xmath56 ( for @xmath95 , there is no reason to consider @xmath57 ) using the histogram mc simulation . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : log - log ] , for @xmath99 the standard ising value of the critical exponents ratio @xmath105 @xcite was recovered with a fair precision , while for @xmath104 even a negative value was obtained .",
    "we conjecture that the anomalies in the response functions for @xmath104 originate from the presence of finite clusters of ordered spins rather than the long - range ordering , and therefore , we roughly estimate the value of @xmath96 to fall into the region of @xmath106 . on the other hand ,",
    "mft is not able to deal correctly with the percolation problem and predicts @xmath107 @xcite .       for @xmath94 and different values of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath101 .",

    "the compensation temperature @xmath112 is the temperature at which total magnetization of the system @xmath113 vanishes below its critical temperature @xmath71 and it is determined by the condition @xmath114 . in this subsection",
    "we do not investigate in detail the compensation behaviour of the current model for various values of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath6 but rather focus on the situation corresponding to the real prussian blue analog @xmath2 @xmath3\\cdot n { \\rm h}_2 { \\rm o}$ ] case , i.e. the case of @xmath94 , for which we can confront our results with some experimental findings @xcite .",
    "for this value of the exchange ratio we found a compensation behaviour for the concentration values @xmath6 ranging approximately between @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which roughly coincides with the results predicted by mft @xcite and eft @xcite .",
    "some examples of the variation of the total magnetization with temperature in this concentration region are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - t ] .",

    "these theoretical results are in line with the experimental magnetization measurements @xcite , in which the compensation behaviour was observed for the concentrations @xmath117 .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath6 was not explored in this experimental study , but the susceptibility measurements in @xcite suggest that the concentration at which the compensation line joins the critical one is close to @xmath118 i.e. , close to the theoretical predictions .     for @xmath94 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , @xmath101 , and @xmath119 . ]",
    "( bullets ) and @xmath120 ( diamonds ) , obtained from finite - size scaling analyses of the staggered and direct susceptibilities , respectively , as functions of the mixing ratio @xmath6 for @xmath94 . ]",
    "the latter measurements revealed an unusual behaviour of the susceptibility at a critical temperature in the vicinity of the compensation point at @xmath118 .",
    "namely , for @xmath118 the paramagnetic susceptibility did not diverge near @xmath71 .",
    "motivated by this finding , we simulated the susceptibility for the same concentration and compared its behaviour with that further away from @xmath118 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi - t ] .",
    "while the curves for @xmath104 and @xmath119 show prominent peaks at the transition ( proper divergence can not be observed due to finite - size effects ) , the one for @xmath99 is almost flat .",
    "we note that a significant contribution to the relatively large error bars at the susceptibility peaks for @xmath104 and @xmath119 , besides the fluctuations of the peaks heights , come also from the fluctuations of the peaks positions obtained from different realizations . on the other hand",
    ", the principal source of the errors away from the peaks , where normally relatively small fluctuations are expected , is decreasing reliability of the reweighted values from the hmc method as we move away from the simulation temperature ( usually chosen close to the peak s location @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the small error bars for @xmath99 in the vicinity of the critical temperature indicate absence of the characteristic peak in all realizations .    this phenomenon can be explained by observing temperature dependences of the magnetization curves in this region of the concentration @xmath6 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - t ] , for @xmath121 the compensation effect occurs due to different temperature dependences of the sublattice magnetizations .",
    "namely , as the temperature approaches the critical value @xmath71 from below , the positive sublattice magnetizations ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) prevail over the negative one ( @xmath124 ) , resulting in the finite ( positive ) value of the total magnetization .",
    "however , as @xmath6 approaches the value of @xmath101 ( from either side ) , the positive and negative sublattice magnetizations tend to cancel out just below @xmath71 ( see the case of @xmath99 in fig . [",
    "fig : m - t ] ) .",
    "this situation is characteristic for an antiferromagnetic system which exhibits zero total magnetization and non - divergent behaviour of the direct susceptibility at critical ( or nel ) temperature .    in order to explore this behaviour in more detail",
    ", we focused on the behaviour of the susceptibility critical exponents in the area where the critical and compensation temperature lines merge .",
    "the exponents are calculated from the finite - size scaling given by equation ( [ eq.scalchi ] ) , using the histogram mc simulations .",
    "[ fig : fss ] demonstrates that while the ratio of the exponents @xmath125 , corresponding to the staggered susceptibility , retains the values close to the standard ising value @xmath105 @xcite in the whole concentration range , the ratio @xmath120 , corresponding to the direct susceptibility , clearly deviates from this value in a relatively broad range of @xmath6 .",
    "namely , it gradually decreases as the value of @xmath99 is approached from either side and it practically vanishes at @xmath126 .",
    "thus , this mc result clearly confirms the experimental @xcite and mft @xcite predictions that the direct susceptibility of the prussian blue analog @xmath1 \\cdot n { \\rm h_2o}$ ] for a special value of @xmath6 , for which the compensation line terminates at the phase transition boundary , does not diverge at the critical temperature .",
    "furthermore , it suggests that the susceptibility critical exponents of the model with a compensation behaviour might be affected by the proximity of the compensation point .",
    "this will be subject to further investigation .",
    "we employed standard and histogram monte carlo simulations to study the critical and compensation properties of a ternary ferro - ferrimagnetic spin alloy of the type @xmath0 on a cubic lattice , focusing on the case with the lattice stoichiometry and the parameters corresponding to the prussian blue analog @xmath1 \\cdot n { \\rm h_2o}$ ] .",
    "we confirmed the existence of the critical superexchange interaction ratio @xmath83 for which the critical temperature does not depend on the mixing ratio of the ions on @xmath19 and @xmath22 sublattices , which had been predicted within the mfa @xcite as well as mc simulations on a square lattice with equivalent sublattices ( @xmath7 stoichiometry ) @xcite .",
    "more importantly , we found that the value of @xmath74 is virtually insensitive to the change in the stoichiometry and , therefore the lattice coordination number , and is close to that predicted by mft on the same lattice @xcite and that evaluated by mc simulations on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these results , a recent mc study on the present spin system with equivalent sublattices gave quite different value of @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that this result is erroneous . our suspicion is based not only on the deviating value of @xmath83 , but also an unusually high value of the critical temperature for @xmath83 or equivalently for @xmath77 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the binary mixture of the spins @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and its critical temperature had already been established within mft @xcite and eft with correlations @xcite to be respectively roughly equal and lower than that obtained by the mc simulation in @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that effective field theories generally overestimate the value of the critical temperature in comparison with mc simulations .",
    "finally , we showed that for @xmath95 the long - range order does not survive down to @xmath76 , as predicted by mft , and we roughly estimated the bounds for the percolation threshold @xmath96 . focusing on the case of @xmath94 and @xmath8 stoichiometry ,",
    "corresponding to the real compound @xmath1 \\cdot n { \\rm h_2o}$ ] , we reproduced the experimentally observed phenomenon of a non - divergent direct susceptibility at the critical temperature in the vicinity of a compensation point .",
    "this peculiar behaviour of the direct susceptibility was demonstrated by evaluation of the critical exponents in the finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "based on the above considerations , it can be concluded that the current monte carlo study brought both quantitative and qualitative improvement over the results previously obtained within mft .",
    "nevertheless , despite its simplicity , mft in many respects did a good job of predicting the critical and compensation behaviour of the ternary alloy considered in the study .",
    "this finding corroborates that resulting from the experimental study of the magnetic properties of the prussian blue analogs @xcite .",
