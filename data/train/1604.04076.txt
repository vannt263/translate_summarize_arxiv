    "high energy @xmath2 linear colliders , like international @xmath0 linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite and compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite , are attractive candidates of energy frontier experiment in the future .",
    "the future @xmath0 colliders will not only study the detail of standard - model ( sm ) particles , particularly higgs boson and top quark , but also provide important information about new physics at the electroweak scale ( if it exists ) . for the @xmath2 linear collider experiments in the future , it is crucial to understand how and how well the information about various new physics models can be obtained there .",
    "notably , in december of 2015 , both the atlas and cms collaborations announced the excess in the di - photon invariant mass distribution @xcite .",
    "the atlas observed the excess with @xmath3-@xmath4 ( @xmath5-@xmath4 ) local ( global ) significance at @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 being the di - photon invariant mass ) for a narrow width case .",
    "furthermore , the cms result shows an excess with the local ( global ) significance of @xmath8-@xmath4 ( @xmath9-@xmath4 ) at @xmath10 .",
    "these signals may indicate the existence of a new scalar resonance with the mass of @xmath11 , although more data is needed to confirm or exclude such a possibility , ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "if there exists such a resonance , its properties should be studied in detail by the future @xmath0 collider experiments @xcite .",
    "currently , the ilc is planned to be extendable up to @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 being the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of the collider ) .",
    "in addition , the energy of clic can be as high as a few tev . with such cm energies , the resonance with its mass of @xmath14 is kinematically reachable .",
    "in particular , in some class of models , the resonance can be produced in association with neutral electroweak gauge bosons ( i.e. , @xmath15 or @xmath1 ) and via the vector - boson fusion processes at the @xmath0 colliders .",
    "once produced , the properties of the resonance may be studied with a high luminosity and a clean environment of the future @xmath0 colliders .",
    "if there exists a new resonance , it is important to understand how it interacts with other fields . as mentioned above , one attractive explanation of the lhc di - photon excess is the existence of a scalar resonance with its mass of @xmath16 coupled to the standard - model ( sm ) gauge bosons . in addition , as well as the coupling to the gauge bosons , the scalar boson may also couple to other fields .",
    "for example , the scalar resonance may have a coupling to an invisible new particle which may be dark matter of the universe ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "understanding of the properties of the scalar resonance will be a very important issue if it exists .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to consider the production and the decay of the scalar boson ( which we call @xmath17 ) , which is responsible for the lhc di - photon excess , at the future @xmath0 colliders .",
    "we calculate the production cross section of such a scalar resonance at the @xmath0 colliders .",
    "we also estimate the number of backgrounds , and discuss the detectability of each decay mode of @xmath17 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we summarize the model we consider . in section",
    "[ sec : production ] , we discuss the production processes of @xmath17 at the @xmath2 colliders . in particular , we study the production of @xmath17 in association with @xmath15 or @xmath1 , and also the production via the vector - boson fusion processes . in section [ sec : sm ] , we consider the detectability of the @xmath17 production signal in which @xmath17 decays into sm gauge bosons .",
    "detectability of the invisible decay of @xmath17 is discussed in section [ sec : invisible ] .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted for conclusions and discussion .",
    "let us first summarize the interaction of the new scalar boson of our interest . in order to make our discussion concrete",
    ", we assume that the scalar boson @xmath17 is pseudo - scalar , and that it has the following interaction @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are field strength tensors for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 gauge interactions , respectively , and the superscript @xmath25 and @xmath26 are indices of the adjoint representations of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "( even if @xmath17 is a real scalar boson , the following results are almost unchanged . )",
    "the summations over the repeated indices are implicit . because the interactions given in eq .",
    "are non - renormalizable , it is expected that there exists some dynamics which generates the interaction between @xmath17 and sm gauge bosons .",
    "we do not specify the dynamics behind the effective lagrangian , and use eq .   for our study.if the energy of the collider becomes larger than the energy scale of the new physics responsible for the effective interaction , the calculation based on eq .   may be inaccurate .",
    "we assume that it is not the case .",
    "in particular , if the scale of generating @xmath27 is close to @xmath28 , on the contrary , momentum - dependent corrections to the effective lagrangian can become sizable .",
    "study of such an effect is interesting because it may reveal the dynamics behind the interaction of @xmath17 with the sm gauge bosons .",
    "such an issue is , however , beyond the scope of our study , and we leave it for future study . with the above interaction terms ,",
    "the partial decay rates of @xmath17 into the gauge bosons are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the masses of @xmath17 , @xmath1 , and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "for the definitions of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , see appendix .",
    "as we have mentioned , we also consider the case where @xmath17 has an invisible decay mode .",
    "in such a case , we treat the invisible decay width @xmath37 as a free parameter without specifying the interaction giving rise to such a decay .",
    "( here and hereafter , the invisible particle is denoted as @xmath38 . )",
    "one example is the interaction of the form of @xmath39 , with which @xmath38 is regarded as a gauge singlet weyl fermion .",
    "for the total decay width @xmath40 , because @xmath17 may decay into particles other than the sm gauge bosons or the invisible particle , @xmath40 is regarded as a free parameter . in addition , we assume that @xmath41 so that the narrow width approximation is applicable .    in the following ,",
    "we consider two possible production processes at the lhc .",
    "one is the gluon - gluon fusion process , for which the lhc cross section ( with the cm energy of @xmath42 ) is estimated as @xmath43 ,    \\label{sig_gg(phiv)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the other is photon - photon fusion process @xcite , for which @xmath44^{-1 }    \\times    \\left [       \\frac{\\gamma ( \\phi\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma)}{100\\ { \\rm mev } }    \\right]^2 .",
    "\\label{sig_gmmgmm(phiv)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one should note that , with the di - photon production cross section at the lhc being fixed , a larger value of @xmath45 is needed for the case of photon - photon fusion dominance compared to the gluon - gluon fusion dominance .",
    "this fact has an important implication to the @xmath0 colliders .",
    "with the interaction given in eq .  , the @xmath17 production may occur at the @xmath0 colliders via several processes .",
    "we first consider the production processes in association with neutral electroweak gauge bosons :    * @xmath46 , * @xmath47 .",
    "feynman diagrams contributing to these processes are shown in fig.[fig : prodilc_sv ] .",
    "the analytic expressions of the cross sections of these processes are given in appendix . in order to discuss the production process of @xmath17 at the @xmath0 colliders in the light of the lhc di - photon excess , it is convenient to parameterize the cross sections of these processes by using the lhc cross sections",
    ". notably , the ratio @xmath48 depends only on the ratio @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 or @xmath1 ) .",
    "then , using eq .",
    ", one can see that the following relation holds : @xmath51 ,    \\label{sigma_gg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 depends only on the ratio @xmath49 ( as far as @xmath30 and @xmath13 are fixed ) .",
    "the above relation is useful when the lhc di - photon excess originates from the gluon - gluon fusion .",

    "notice that the regions with too small or too large @xmath49 are excluded by the @xmath65 run of the lhc .",
    "the most stringent bound comes from the negative searches for the resonance which decays into @xmath66 ; for example , taking @xmath67 @xcite and the lhc cross section of the di - photon signal events to be @xmath68 , only the region with @xmath69 is allowed . in such a region , @xmath56 and",
