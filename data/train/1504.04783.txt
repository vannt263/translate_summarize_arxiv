    "the subject of photon generation in nonstationary circuit qed , where mesoscopic artificial atoms(constructed with josephson junctions @xcite ) interact with the electromagnetic field confined in superconducting stripline resonators under nonstationary conditions @xcite , has been studied theoretically for nearly ten years .",
    "traditionally one considered the externally prescribed modulation of either the cavity frequency pla , fedotov , roberto,2level , zei,2,sinaia1,sinaia2,cacheffo , the atom  field coupling strength @xcite or the atomic transition frequency @xcite , while recently more sophisticated schemes involving multi - level atoms , several qubits or coupled cavities were examined 3level , back,2atom , sinaia1,camop , solano .",
    "such a unique possibility of _ in situ _ control of the fundamental parameters of the hamiltonian became possible thanks to the highly controllable solid state environment in which the system properties can be manipulated by external electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that modulation of _ any _ system parameter gives rise to similar effects of roughly the same order of magnitude , and simultaneous modulation of different parameters with the same frequency can increase or decrease the associated transition rate depending on the relative phases of modulations @xcite .",
    "moreover , multi - tone modulations  comprising two or more harmonic functions of time can lead to new types of effective interactions @xcite .",
    "however , actual circuit qed architectures suffer from unavoidable dissipation effects , in particular , the damping of the cavity field , the atomic relaxation and the pure atomic dephasing @xcite . although some works on photon generation in nonstationary circuit qed analyzed the effects of losses @xcite , the majority of studies investigated only the unitary dynamics for different regimes of parameters and modulation shapes .",
    "now that the general analytical description in absence of losses has been formulated in a closed form ( under a series of approximations ) @xcite , the question of utmost practical interest is how dissipation affects the modulation - induced phenomena and whether they can be implemented with present or near - future technology .",
    "so the goal of this work is to unveil which nonstationary phenomena can be implemented experimentally with the current technology @xcite and comprehend how different dissipation channels affect the time evolution .",
    "we concentrate on the single - qubit , single - mode circuit qed setup and take into account the three aforementioned dissipation mechanisms using the markovian and zero - temperature approximations . the master equation appropriate to this case , which takes into account the qubit  resonator coupling , was deduced microscopically in @xcite . in this",
    "so called dressed - picture master equation  ( dpme ) the dissipation rates depend on the spectrum of noise evaluated at the frequency matching the transition between the atom  field eigenstates ( dressed states ) , so a prior knowledge of the bath structure is required .",
    "besides , the analytical solution is complicated in majority of cases , so we carry out exact numerical simulations by assuming that the noise has a flat spectrum at positive frequencies and is zero for the negative ones .",
    "the details of the underlying mathematical formalism can be found in section s2 .",
    "we consider several regimes of photon generation and annihilation due to modulation of the atomic transition frequency and the atom  field coupling strength .",
    "first we study the generation of two excitations from vacuum in the resonant regime ( section [ s4c ] ) and the creation of one photon and one atomic excitation in the dispersive regime ( _ anti - jaynes - cummings _ behavior , section [ s4a ] ) for single - tone modulations .",
    "then we analyze the recently discovered _ anti - dynamical casimir effect _",
    "( anti - dce , section [ s4b ] ) , whereby two excitations are coherently annihilated due to the modulation of qubit parameters in the dispersive regime @xcite .",
    "we show that the above phenomena can be enhanced by using two - tone modulations ( section [ s5 ] ) , for which a total of four excitations can be generated from vacuum or annihilated from a known initial state .",
    "quantum states with even more excitations can be generated from vacuum in the dispersive regime via the _ dynamical casimir effect _",
    "( dce , section [ s3 ] ) , when the system parameters are modulated with frequency roughly equal to twice the cavity unperturbed frequency .",
    "it is shown that all the above phenomena can be implemented with current technology in dissipative circuit qed , although dce and anti - dce require state - of - the - art dissipation rates and precise tuning of the modulation frequency .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate numerically that for time intervals of interest the predictions of dpme are almost indistinguishable from the ones obtained for the standard master equation  ( sme ) of quantum optics @xcite , which is much simpler to handle and whose approximate solution is deduced here in the long - time limit .",
    "the atom  field interaction is described by the rabi hamiltonian rabi , jpcs , werlang and for generality we take into account the parametric amplification term due to eventual time - modulation of the cavity parameters @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian reads ( we set @xmath0)@xmath1where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are cavity annihilation and creation operators and @xmath4 is the photon number operator ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the atomic ladder operators , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) denotes the atomic ground ( excited ) state .",

    "if the initial cavity state is known and the population of the excited atomic state is negligible , one can transfer completely the populations of @xmath232 to @xmath233 at specific times without affecting the other states , so four photons are indeed annihilated . if the initial statistics is not known , the transfer is not complete because the required value of @xmath234 can not be determined beforehand .    for sme",
    "we reach the same conclusions about the asymptotic behavior as in section [ s4b ] , supplemented by the additional condition @xmath235 under pure atomic dephasing .",
    "as the associated transition rates are similar to the one estimated in section [ s4b ] , the enhanced anti - dce also lies at the threshold of experimental feasibility , provided two simultaneous fine - tuned modulations can be sustained for a time interval of a few @xmath236s .",

    "we see that the reduction of @xmath128 is stronger than in the standard anti - dce case , occurring at larger timescales ; the @xmath242factor increases while the atomic excitation probability undergoes faster oscillations and is slightly smaller than in figure [ fig3]a because the transfer of population from @xmath243 to @xmath244 is only partial .",

    "the asymptotic solution for a similar problem ( parametric amplification in the presence of kerr nonlinearity and cavity relaxation ) was obtained two decades ago using the method of potential solutions for the corresponding fokker - planck equation kryuch1,kryuch2 .",
    "however , the asymptotic solution is of little use in our case because the photon statistics during the transient time can be quite different from the asymptotic one @xcite , so we rely entirely on numerical simulations .    for our tentative parameters we estimate @xmath254 , so in principle the single - qubit dce could be observed in the current state - of - the - art architectures .",

    "we see that photons can be generated and the collapse  revival of @xmath131 can be observed on the timescale of a few @xmath236s .",
    "notice that the collapse ",
    "revival behavior is not associated to the absorption and reemission of photons by the atom @xcite , as the atomic excitation probability stays @xmath261 for all times .",
    "more photons can be generated if one adds a second modulation frequency or increases @xmath262 or @xmath263 @xcite , but in the latter case the parameter @xmath264 decreases so the process becomes slower and demands more precise tuning of the modulation frequency .",
    "we estimated the rates of photon creation and annihilation for some nonstationary phenomena induced by fast modulation of qubit parameters in dissipative circuit qed .",
    "two different markovian master equations ( standard  and dressed - picture  master equations ) were used to account for the common sources of dissipation , and we verified that for the relevant regime of parameters the predicted behaviors are almost identical .",
