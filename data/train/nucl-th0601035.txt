    "<S> in order to discuss the spatial extention of the @xmath0 state of @xmath1c ( hoyle state ) , we analyze the inelastic form factor of electron scattering to the hoyle state , which our @xmath2 condensate wave function reproduces very well like previous @xmath2 rgm / gcm models . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is made by varying the size of the hoyle state artificially . as a result , we find that only the maximum value of the form factor sensitively depends on its size , while the positions of maximum and minimum are almost unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this size dependence is found to come from a characteristic feature of the transition density from the ground state to the hoyle state . </S>",
    "<S> we further show the theoretical predictions of the inelastic form factor to the @xmath3 state of @xmath1c , which was recently observed above the hoyle state , and of the inelastic form factor to the calculated @xmath4 state of @xmath5o , which was conjectured to correspond to the @xmath6 condensed state in previous theoretical work by the present authors .    in this short communication </S>",
    "<S> we want to report on our calculation of the elastic and inelastic form factors for ground and hoyle states in @xmath1c . </S>",
    "<S> we also make predictions for the inelastic form factors , @xmath7 in @xmath1c and @xmath8-condensate state in @xmath5o .    </S>",
    "<S> as we have shown previously , our alpha particle wave function , published in @xcite , very nicely reproduces on the one hand some experimental data in @xmath1c and on the other hand it is in close agreement with calculated results of kamimura _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore not so surprising that our wave function also reproduces very well the elastic and inelastic @xmath9 form factors in @xmath1c as this was the case in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this gives quite definite support to our interpretation of the hoyle state as being a condensate of almost independent alpha particles  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the form factor is obtained by performing the fourier transformation of the transition density as follows , @xmath10 here @xmath11 @xmath12 is taken as the finite proton size , which is the same as adopted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xmath13 is the @xmath14-th order spherical bessel function . </S>",
    "<S> the transition density @xmath15 is given as , @xmath16 where the ground and hoyle states can be obtained by solving the following hill - wheeler equation , @xmath17 @xmath18 we here use the same notation for the alpha condensate wave function , @xmath19 as was done in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath20 is the same as used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ground and hoyle states correspond to the cases of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:4 ] ) , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] and we give our numerical values in table  [ tab:1 ] . reflecting the fact that our wave functions of the ground state and the @xmath0 state are almost equivalent to those given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using resonating group method ( rgm ) , our elastic and inelastic @xmath9 form factors almost completely agree with those given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1_5 ] , we predict the inelastic form factor to the @xmath3 state which is obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by using the @xmath2 condensate wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> this state was recently observed at @xmath23 mev above the three alpha threshold  @xcite , though the exsistence of this state has been suggested for a long time from the theoretical point of view  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently this state was carefully investigated by the present authors  @xcite showing that the @xmath3 state is intimately related to the @xmath0 state which is interpreted as the @xmath2 bose - condensate state .    </S>",
    "<S> we now make a study of the sensitivity of the inelastic form factor with respect to some theoretical ingredients of our theory . </S>",
    "<S> a quantity of prime interest is the spatial extention of the hoyle state which is predicted from our studies to have a volume @xmath24 to @xmath25 times as large as the one of the ground state of @xmath1c . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore repeated the calculation of the inelastic form factor in varying the size parameter of the hoyle state . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation can be done as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by adopting as the hoyle state the wave function , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is defined as the projection operator onto the orthogonal space to the ground state :    @xmath28    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:1 ]    @xmath29max@xmath30 , is plotted as a function of @xmath31 , which is defined as @xmath32 . </S>",

    "<S> unit of @xmath38 is in fm . ]    here the parameter @xmath39 corresponds to the spatial extention of the alpha condensate . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , the form factors from the ground state to the hoyle state calculated at several @xmath40 values are shown . </S>",
    "<S> short - hand notations @xmath41 and @xmath42  @xcite are used here and in the following . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding r.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> radii are shown in parentheses . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the overall structure of the form factor is not very much affected by artificially changing the radius of the hoyle state , i.e. for instance the position of the minimum is only changed in very slight proportions . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can see that the amplitude decreases as the r.m.s radius of the @xmath0 state increases . in order to see how </S>",
    "<S> sensitively the height of the first maximum depends on the r.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> radius of the @xmath0 state , we plot on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] the variation of this height with respect to the size of the hoyle state and we see that this height changes strongly when the r.m.s radius of the @xmath0 state is changed . it is therefore allowed to say that the measurement of the inelastic form factor of @xmath43-particle condensate states allows via our model wave function to deduce the radius of such a state . </S>",
    "<S> we should note that the wave function of the @xmath0 state @xmath44 can be described rather well by @xmath45 as far as reasonable @xmath39 values are adopted . </S>",
    "<S> the squared overlap between @xmath44 and @xmath45 amounts to @xmath46% at @xmath47 . due to this </S>",
    "<S> almost complete equivalence between both wave functions , @xmath44 and @xmath36 , we understand that the corresponding inelastic form factors obtained by using both wave functions , i.e. denoted by hw and @xmath48 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , almost completely agree with one another . </S>",
    "<S> as for the other choices of @xmath39 , @xmath45 also has a reasonably large amount of squared overlap with @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath49% , @xmath50% , and @xmath51% at @xmath52 fm , 3.76 fm , and 5.27 fm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that the fact that the wave function @xmath45 which is parametrized by @xmath38 is more or less a good approximation of the @xmath0 state guarantees the validity of the above discussion of size dependence .    </S>",
    "<S> we can analyze the reason for these features of the form factor in the following simple way . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3a ] we show the transition density @xmath53 for different values of @xmath38 . due to the orthogonality between @xmath54 and @xmath55 one has the relation @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the position of the node of @xmath53 at @xmath57 fm and the point where this transition density drops approximately to zero , i.e. at @xmath58 fm , do not depend on the various values of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> also the feature of an approximate odd function around the nodal point holds for all @xmath38-values . </S>",
    "<S> it clearly can be concluded that one can approximately write @xmath59 where @xmath60 is independent of @xmath61 and a decreasing function of @xmath38 , whereas @xmath62 is independent of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the form factor @xmath63 just changes amplitude but not shape when the size of the hoyle state is varied . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is completely consistent with the features seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] .    ) multiplied by @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath53 , corresponding to wave functions @xmath65 with different @xmath66 values . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 is given by @xmath67 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the r.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> radii corresponding to @xmath68 are shown in parentheses . </S>",
    "<S> units of all numbers are in fm.,width=302,height=264 ]    on these grounds we also want to make a prediction of the inelastic form factor to the @xmath43-condensate state in @xmath5o . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] we show this form factor calculated with the @xmath43-particle condensate wave function for @xmath5o determined previously  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this latter state is actually the @xmath24rd @xmath69 state of our calculation whose energy is at @xmath70 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the inelastic form factor for @xmath5o resembles very much in its structure the one of @xmath1c . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of minimum and maximum are almost unchanged , while the height of the first maximum is relatively suppressed compared to the case of @xmath1c . </S>",
    "<S> a candidate of the @xmath6 condensate state may have been observed at @xmath71 mev with an alpha decay width of @xmath72 mev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this new state is the @xmath73th @xmath69 state experimentally , corresponding to the @xmath24rd @xmath69 state of our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> an argument that in @xmath5o the @xmath43-condensate state is around @xmath71 mev could go as follows : it is well known that the second @xmath69 state in @xmath5o at @xmath74 mev has a structure of an @xmath43-particle orbiting in an @xmath75-wave around an @xmath1c - core  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> exciting this @xmath1c - core to the hoyle state we find the excitation energy @xmath76 mev . </S>",
    "<S> of course , this close agreement may be a pure coincidence and more experimental evidences are needed </S>",
    "<S> .    the experimental determination of the corresponding form factor would be highly welcome and an eventual agreement with our calculated result , we think , a clear indication of the dilute @xmath43-particle structure of the corresponding @xmath69 state in @xmath5o .    in conclusion , we showed that , without adjustable parameters , our proposed condensate wave function for alpha particles  @xcite nicely reproduces the experimental inelastic form factor @xmath77 in @xmath1c . together with its high sensitivity on the magnitude of the hoyle state with respect to its size and the reproduction of other experimental data  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we believe that the almost ideal bose condensate nature of the hoyle state is now firmly established . we also made predictions for the inelastic form factor to the @xmath3 state in @xmath1c which we interpreted in @xcite as a quadrupole particle - hole excitation of the hoyle state . </S>",
    "<S> a prediction of the form factor @xmath78 condensate state in @xmath5o is also presented and it is argued that an experimental confirmation of this form factor undoubtedly would reveal the condensate character of the corresponding state . </S>"
