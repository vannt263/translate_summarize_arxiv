    "strongly coupled plasmas in which the coulomb interaction energy per particle exceeds the thermal energy are of high interest in dusty plasmas , trapped ions , colloidal systems , quantum confined semiconductor structures as well as in diverse astrophysical environments . in recent years",
    "much attention has been devoted to study the structural properties , oscillation spectra and transport properties of these systems both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "a particularly detailed analysis was performed for colloidal and dusty plasmas , e.g. @xcite , where one takes advantage of the large particle size ( micrometers ) that allows for single - particle resolution and optical diagnostics .",
    "therefore , the latter plasmas have been successfully used as a unique `` laboratory for strong correlations '' in coulomb systems in general @xcite allowing , for example , to make predictions of important structural and dynamical properties of such exotic objects as white dwarf stars or neutron stars , which are not directly accessible to experimental studies .",
    "many strongly correlated plasmas are , in addition , subject to a strong magnetic field which may significantly alter the plasma behaviour .",
    "examples are the electron - hole plasma in semiconductor quantum wells ( quantum hall systems ) , magnetic target fusion scenarios or the plasma in the outer layers of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies showed that the magnetic field drastically alters the particle and energy transport in these systems , in particular the diffusion coefficient @xcite , see sec .",
    "[ s : magnetization ] and the collective oscillation spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to directly verify these predictions in the laboratory with dusty plasmas , making use of the above mentioned unique spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "unfortunately , due to the large particle size , it is practically impossible to magnetize a dusty plasma , see sec .",
    "[ s : magnetization ] .",
    "we have recently presented a solution to this dilemma : the key idea is to put the dust particles into rotation via a rotation of the neutral gas .",
    "then , in the rotating frame , the dust particles are subject to the coriolis force that is equivalent to the lorentz force of a magnetic field . a brief derivation and proof of principle experiment",
    "was reported in  @xcite for a system of 4 dust particles in a plane . in this paper",
    "we present a more detailed derivation of the equations of motion of a rotating dusty plasma , extend the analysis to macroscopic 2d systems and analyze the achievable `` magnetization '' , see sec .",

    "that we introduce , in sec .",
    "[ s : magnetization ] , the relevant parameters of a strongly correlated magnetized plasma , discuss important special cases and the main effects of the magnetic field .",
    "a classical strongly coupled coulomb system in thermodynamic equilibrium is described by a single dimensionless parameter , the coupling parameter @xmath0 this assumes that the dynamics can be described by that of an effective one - component system ( ocp ) where the second component assures neutralization ( and possibly screening of the interaction ) but does not dynamically participate .",
    "this is well fulfilled in the case of large mass asymmetry of the components , such as in dusty plasmas ( if ion streaming is not important ) or in dwarf stars and the envelope of neutron stars and will be at the basis of the present analysis . thus , eq .  ( [ eqn : gamma ] ) contains only properties of the heavy component : the particle charge @xmath1 , the mean inter - particle distance ( wigner - seitz radius ) @xmath2 and the temperature @xmath3 that is related to the thermal velocity @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass .",
    "a second quantity that characterizes the strength of the coulomb interaction is the plasma frequency ( dim@xmath6 is the dimensionality ) , @xmath7 typical correlation effects are depicted in figure  [ fig : traject ] , where we show the trajectories of several particles computed from a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation . for moderate coupling ( @xmath8 , top left ) free flight periods",
    "are occasionally interrupted by collisions that bend the trajectories .",
    "in contrast , for strong coupling ( @xmath9 , bottom left ) , the interaction is so strong that particles are trapped in local minima of the total potential energy ( `` caging '' ) exhibiting localized oscillations",

    "have a comparable effect on the trajectories whereas , in the right column , the b - field clearly dominates , giving rise to the familiar helical orbits . at strong coupling , evidently , the orbits are much smaller , nevertheless the particles remain localized around their mean positions",
    ". we may quantify the relative strength of correlations and magnetic field by introducing dimensionless energy and length parameters , @xmath14 typical parameter regimes for various strongly coupled plasmas are shown in figure  [ fig : n - t ] .    from the trajectories",
    "it should be expected that macroscopic transport properties of the plasma will be strongly influenced both by coulomb correlations and the magnetic field .",
    "an increase of @xmath15 leads to localization and thus tends to reduce the particle mobility .",
    "similarly , an increase of the field strength will also tend to confine the particles in the direction perpendicular to @xmath16 .",
    "the combined effect of coulomb correlations and magnetic field on the particle transport in a 3d ocp has recently been studied by first - principle md simulations @xcite and confirmed these expectations as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : d ] .",
    "there is a systematic reduction of the diffusion coefficient with @xmath15 , left figure . with increased magnetic field",
    "the diffusion perpendicular to @xmath17 is further inhibited ( right figure ) .",
    "an interesting effect is seen in the longitudinal diffusion coefficient .",
    "although there is no component of the lorentz force parallel to @xmath17 and particle transport in this direction should remain unaffected , this picture breaks down in a strongly correlated plasma .",
    "the reason is that , upon increase of @xmath15 , large - angle scattering occurs more frequently which couples the motion perpendicular and parallel to the field . as a result the diffusion parallel to @xmath17",
    "becomes also influenced ( and suppressed ) by the field , and eventually ( see curves for @xmath9 ) the two diffusion coefficients approach each other .",
    "we also point out that the decay of both diffusion coefficients approaches , for large b - fields , a @xmath18 power law which is familiar from ideal high - temperature plasmas ( bohm diffusion ) .",
    "this indicates that here collective mechanisms such as transport mediated by magneto - plasmon excitations become dominant .",
    "in fact , the oscillation spectrum of magnetized strongly correlated plasmas has recently been computed numerically for 2d @xcite and 3d systems @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field was found to drastically alter the oscillation spectrum giving rise to nonlinear effects such as bernstein modes and higher harmonics .",
    "again , these effects become relevant for sufficiently strong fields characterized by @xmath19 .    summarizing",
    ", we note that correlations and magnetic field ( for @xmath20 ) suppress the particle mobility by about four orders of magnitude compared to the case of an unmagnetized weakly coupled plasma which is crucial for a broad range of laboratory plasma applications and for many astrophysical problems , such as the evolution of stellar objects .",
    "it would , therefore , be highly desirable to probe this regime of strongly correlated and strongly magnetized plasmas with @xmath21 and @xmath19 in a laboratory experiment with dusty plasmas making use of the unprecedented resolution capabilities , e.g. @xcite . after extreme values of @xmath15",
    "are now routinely achieved , let us now estimate the possible values of @xmath22 . assuming a mass of @xmath23 , one obtains for a typical experiment ( @xmath24  @xcite ) and a field of @xmath25 t , common for superconducting magnets , a magnetization @xmath26 .",
    "this value may be increased if one uses smaller ( i.e. , lighter ) particles . however , even then , this is still below the range of interest .",
    "furthermore , one would lose the key advantages of dusty plasmas : first , smaller particles collect a lower charge which decreases @xmath15 .",
    "second , the diagnostics of very small particles becomes increasingly difficult , and more sophisticated methods other than video microscopy may become necessary to reliably detect the dust grains . finally , while the dust is practically un - magnetized , electrons and ( partially ) ions are magnetized resulting in very different plasma properties .",
    "a way out of this seemingly hopeless situation has been recently proposed and demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "the key is the fourth component of a complex plasma  the neutral gas  which has been completely disregarded so far in our discussion .",
    "even though the typical dust - neutral damping rates are very low , in particular compared to colloidal suspensions  @xcite , the small yet finite friction force is sufficient to control the global motion of the dust component .",
    "this was demonstrated in experiments by carstensen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who used a spinning electrode to create a global rotation of the neutral gas in the discharge chamber .",
    "one application of their method involved the centrifugal force , which was used to determine the particle charge  @xcite .",
    "it was recently demonstrated  @xcite that the second apparent force in a rotating reference frame  the coriolis force  can be used to `` magnetize '' the dust grains .",
    "we now present details of this approach .      in the laboratory system ,",

    "for the special case of a uniform angular velocity @xmath42 , @xmath43 , one can adopt the point of view of an observer at the origin of the coordinate system who co - rotates with the gas column .",

    "has the same form as the langevin equation for a stationary gas .",
    "the confinement potential in the rotating frame must be complemented by the centrifugal potential , i.e. , @xmath51 whereas the interaction forces are equivalent to those in the laboratory frame .",
    "the random force is given by @xmath52 . while @xmath53 , the @xmath54 and @xmath55 components require more attention .",
    "as an example , we consider @xmath56 and calculate its properties . since @xmath57 and both @xmath58 and @xmath59 are not correlated with @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . using @xmath63 and @xmath64 , one can further show that @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the calculations for the @xmath55 component are analogous , and the results can be summarized as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , i.e. , the mean and the correlation function of the random force in the laboratory and the rotating frame are equivalent .",
    "the mathematical equivalence between the lorentz force @xmath69 and the coriolis force is the reason why the approach can be used to study `` magnetized '' plasmas .",
    "when observed in the rotating frame and taking the centrifugal potential into account , the dust particles follow the same physical laws as in a constant magnetic field @xmath70 .",
    "the important quantity for the magnetization parameter   is the cyclotron frequency @xmath71 , which can now be replaced by @xmath72 .",
    "since rotation frequencies of a few hz are easily reached , strong magnetization of the dust component becomes possible , as was verified in experiments with a small cluster  @xcite .",
    "thus rather than trying to overcome the problems encountered when using expensive superconducting magnets , we exploit the advantages a dusty plasma offers . the coordinate transformation from the laboratory to the rotating frame is easily performed , and the same data analysis techniques as for a stationary plasma can be applied .",
    "the variation of the plasma parameters ( coupling , screening ) induced by the centrifugal force are negligible for small rotation frequencies and can be directly accounted for at higher rotation speeds . while the scaling relations for small systems have already been discussed  @xcite",
    ", we now focus on larger ensembles and the transition to bulk behaviour .",
    "particle confinement in dusty plasma experiments is provided by various forces including gravity , electric fields and thermophoresis . in the following ,",
    "we consider a two - dimensional system ( implying strong vertical confinement ) and assume that the particles interact via the yukawa potential @xmath73 , where @xmath74 denotes the debye length .",
    "the effective in - plane confinement is given by a harmonic potential @xmath75 , and all higher order terms are neglected .",
    "their contribution may become important for large cluster sizes or very high rotation frequencies .",

    "they are useful dimensionless parameters for a finite system and scale as  @xcite @xmath81 the scaling behaviour is illustrated in figure  [ fig : density ] , where we show the radial density profile in a stationary gas and at finite rotation frequencies obtained from the numerical solution of the langevin equations   with @xmath82 dust particles  .",
    "as shown in the left panel , the density drops as we increase the rotation frequency .",
    "if the screening and coupling parameters are adjusted according to  , we find excellent agreement with simulations at @xmath83 ( right panel ) , as expected .",
