    "the 2006 outburst of rs oph is almost certainly due to a thermonuclear runaway of hydrogen rich fuel that has accumulated since the previous outburst in 1985 . according to the theories of nova outbursts , both the white dwarf mass and",
    "the mass accretion rate must be high for two consecutive nova outbursts to be separated by such a short interval . according to the calculations of @xcite , a 1.25 m@xmath0 white dwarf accreting at @xmath110@xmath2 m@xmath0yr@xmath3",
    "would accumulate a sufficient amount of fuel in 20 years .",
    "this corresponds to a boundary layer luminosity of @xmath11.4 @xmath4 ergss@xmath3 , assuming that half the potential energy is radiated away in the accretion disk and the white dwarf is rotating slowly .",
    "if rs  oph harbors a 1.4 m@xmath0 white dwarf , it requires less fuel to achieve a thermonuclear runaway .",
    "even then , an accretion rate of @xmath110@xmath5 m@xmath0yr@xmath3 is required , implying a boundary layer luminosity of @xmath13 @xmath6 ergss@xmath3 .",
    "the boundary layer emission is likely to be in the hard or soft x - rays @xcite , where the contribution from the red giant mass donor is expected to be minimal .",
    "we have therefore searched the heasarc archive for past , pointed x - ray observations of rs  oph , excluding those that were performed during the 1985 and 2006 outbursts , and found 7 observations using 4 satellites .",
    "these quiescent x - ray observations are summarized in table 1 . in calculating the luminosity ,",
    "the distance to rs  oph was assumed to be 1.44 kpc , and no correction was made for absorption .",

    "the exposure times were 1.7 ksec in 1979 sep and 5.5 ksec in 1981 apr . in table 1",
    ", we give approximate upper limits , based on an estimate that 10 source counts would have resulted in a detection .",
    "the luminosity limits are then inferred assuming the plasma model parameters that fit the _ rosat _ data described below .    the _ rosat _ pspc detections have already been published by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the former reported on the first observation , and the latter was a compilation of a large number of _ rosat _ observations of novae and recurrent novae . in figure  1 ( left ) , we show the pspc spectrum from the second _ rosat _ observation , together with a mekal model fit , from which we obtain a plasma temperature of kt@xmath10.6 kev and an absorbing column of n@xmath169.6 @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "note , however , that the fit is neither unique nor well constrained due to the low statistical quality of the data .",
    "the estimated n@xmath19 value suggests that the intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) luminosity is about 10 times higher than the observed ( absorbed ) value . while these _ rosat _ observations do establish rs  oph as a soft x - ray source , what about the 210 kev band",
    "the two _ rxte _ observations should be considered non - detections , even though the observed count rates are higher than the predictions of the background model .",
    "the count rate excesses are statistically significant , and are above the estimated systematic errors of the background model that reproduces the non x - ray background and the average cosmic x - ray background",
    ". however , give the location of rs  oph and the collimator response of _ rxte _ pca , contamination due to galactic x - ray background and faint , discrete sources in the field of view at the observed level is quite possible .",
    "imaging x - ray telescopes are necessary to securely detect rs  oph in quiescence .",
    "the _ asca _ observation with an exposure time of @xmath134 ksec is the most sensitive observation to date of 210 kev emission from rs  oph in quiescence .",
    "of the two types of detectors on - board _ asca _ , sis is more sensitive below 2 kev , while gis is more sensitive for harder emission .",
    "the values tabulated in table1 are from gis in two energy bands .",
    "while rs  oph is securely detected below 2 kev ( @xmath20 ctss@xmath3 ) , it is not so in the 210 kev band ( @xmath21 ctss@xmath3 ) .",
    "the analysis of sis data produces similar results .    due to the marginal statistical quality of the data ,",
    "spectral fitting can not provide tight constraints on the spectral shape .",
    "however , the same kt@xmath10.6 kev plasma model that was used for the _ rosat _ spectrum provides a good description of the data below 2 kev , resulting in a luminosity compatible with the first _",
    "this model is shown with the sis data in figure  2 ( right ) .",
    "the possible excess of data over this model above 2 kev may indicate that the emitting plasma is hotter than 0.6 kev overall , or that there is an additional contribution from a hotter plasma .",
    "this is very different from the highly absorbed , bright x - ray component seen in the quiescent recurrent nova , t  crb @xcite , which is otherwise very similar to rs  oph .",
    "t  crb has a very hard , highly absorbed x - ray emission with little flux below 2 kev , with an observed 210 kev luminosity of 12 @xmath22 ergss@xmath3 .",
    "a 210 kev gis count rate of 1.2@xmath14 ctss@xmath3 corresponds to an absorbed luminosity of 25@xmath12 ergss@xmath3 for a kt=30 kev bremsstrahlung spectrum absorbed with n@xmath19 of 10@xmath2310@xmath24 @xmath18 .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity may be up to a factor of 10 higher for the extreme absorption case .",
    "compared with the expected accretion luminosity from the boundary layer , both the observed soft x - ray luminosity and the undetected hard x - ray luminosity of rs  oph are extremely low .",
    "thus , we have a case of `` missing boundary layer '' problem in rs  oph that is perhaps more extreme than any seen in non - magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we may not have detected any boundary layer emission from rs  oph at all : the properties of the detected soft emission is quite similar to those seen in several other symbiotic systems @xcite , for which a colliding winds interpretation has been put forth .",
    "it is unlikely that absorption alone can extinguish the hard x - ray flux sufficiently .",
    "the above analysis shows that even an extreme n@xmath19 of 10@xmath24 @xmath18 is insufficient in itself to reduce a 210 kev x - ray component at the t  crb level to below _",
    "asca _ detectability level .",
    "moreover , such a high column density is significantly above those seen in the hard x - ray component of t  crb , the x - rays from rs  oph in outburst ( up to 5@xmath25 @xmath18 for the early shock emission ; @xcite ) , or in optical data for rs  oph is quiescence ( @xmath110@xmath26 @xmath18 ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the boundary layer is completely optically thick , hard x - rays will not result .",
    "note that the resulting soft x - ray component is likely to be hot in this case .",
    "for example , a 1.4 m@xmath0 white dwarf accreting at @xmath110@xmath5 m@xmath0yr@xmath3 over 10% of its surface area should emit a kt@xmath150 ev blackbody - like soft component , which can only be hidden by a high , though realistic , intrinsic column . in any case , the luck of a hard component is puzzling since , empirically speaking , the boundary layer always appear to have a surface layer optically thin enough to produce hard x - rays @xcite .    if the white dwarf in rs  oph is spinning rapidly , near the break - up frequency , while that in t  crb is not , this would explain the low boundary layer luminosity in the former . while uv spectroscopy of non - magnetic cvs show that they harbor slowly rotating white dwarfs @xcite , accretion of a few tenths of a solar mass should be enough to spin up the cv primaries to near break - up .",
    "cv primaries are slow rotators probably because of the angular momentum removed during nova outbursts , which eject more mass than accreted @xcite and have an extended common envelope phase @xcite .",
    "neither is thought to be the case with rs  oph .",
    "the high white dwarf mass inferred for rs  oph almost certainly means that it has accreted a significant amount of mass , and therefore angular momentum . if indeed the nova mechanism is ineffective in removing angular momentum from the white dwarf in rs  oph , it is quite possibly a fast rotator .    however attractive",
    "this possibility may be , it remains a pure conjecture .",
    "independent studies of this using , e.g. , the morphology of the ejecta @xcite , as well as future quiescent x - ray observations , are strongly encouraged .",
