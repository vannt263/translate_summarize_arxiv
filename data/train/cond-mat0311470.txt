    "density functional theory ( dft ) provides a rigorous framework for studying the physics of the many - body problem.@xcite the fundamental concept behind dft is to replace the conventional dynamical variables that completely define a many - particle state ( e.g. , the wave function in a quantum mechanical problem , or the particle positions and momenta in a classical system ) by considering the particle - density distribution @xmath3 as the basic variable . for this purpose the energy @xmath4 of the system",
    "is expressed as a functional of @xmath3 separating the various energy terms in two main groups .",
    "the first one contains the contributions that depend explicitly on the problem under study , which result from the coupling between @xmath3 and the external fields @xmath5 .",
    "the second one concerns the intrinsic energy of the many - particle system , namely , the kinetic energy @xmath6 and the interaction energy @xmath2 of the particles . these terms are universal functionals of @xmath3 in the sense that they are independent of the problem under study .",

    "this is achieved by imposing that @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] correspond to the minimum possible value of @xmath9 for a given @xmath3.@xcite these basic notions have general validity and are therefore relevant to a wide variety of situations which may have very different physical origins .    in the present paper",
    "the concepts of dft are applied to investigate the physics of strongly correlated electrons in a narrow energy band . the theoretical description of these systems is usually based on lattice hamiltonians such as anderson,@xcite hubbard,@xcite pariser - parr - pople,@xcite and related models which focus on the most relevant electron dynamics at low energies.@xcite the study of many - body lattice models in the framework of dft seems particularly interesting from various perspectives . on the one side ,",
    "a detailed understanding of the electronic properties in the strongly correlated limit constitutes an important theoretical challenge .",
    "exact results are rare or numerically very demanding and a variety of elaborate many - body techniques are specifically developed for their study .",
    "therefore , a density functional approach with an appropriate ansatz for @xmath2 should be a useful alternative tool for investigating at least some aspects of this complex problem .",
    "on the other side , one would like to extend the range of applicability of dft to strongly correlated phenomena , like the separation of charge and spin degrees of freedom or the correlation induced localization , where conventional local density approximations ( ldas ) or generalized gradient approximations ( ggas ) are known to fail systematically .",
    "moreover , the development of dft on a lattice constitutes an intrinsically inhomogeneous approach , which provides a true alternative to methods relying on the homogeneous electron gas . in this context",
    ", investigations on many - body models should open new insights into the properties of the interaction - energy functional that could also be useful for future extensions to more realistic hamiltonians and first principles calculations .",

    "several ground - state properties of one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems have been obtained in good agreement with available exact solutions and accurate numerical calculations.@xcite in addition , applications to dimerized chains provided us with systematic results for the ground - state energy and charge excitation gap of the 1d hubbard model as a function of hopping alternation and coulomb repulsion , including the crossover from weak to strong correlations.@xcite ldft appears therefore as an efficient method of determining the electronic properties of many - body lattice models , thus encouraging further developments and applications .",
