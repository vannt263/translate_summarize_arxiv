    "galaxies are believed to form from gas condensing at the centres of massive dark matter haloes as these grow by collapse and aggregation from weak density fluctuations emerging from the early universe @xcite .",
    "the earliest theoretical insights into the formation and evolution of dark matter haloes were provided by the spherical infall model of @xcite and @xcite . in this model , an isolated overdensity in an otherwise unperturbed einstein - de sitter universe first expands with the hubble flow , then turns around and collapses .",
    "surrounding material continues to fall onto the object until its mass greatly exceeds that of the originally perturbed region .",
    "asymptotically , a power - law density profile is established with @xmath1 .",
    "the late - time structure of this model is a similarity solution whose structure was worked out in detail by @xcite .",
    "more general similarity solutions where the initial mass perturbation scales with enclosed mass as @xmath2 were presented by @xcite who showed that these produce haloes with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "the change in behaviour at @xmath8 reflects the fact that all orbits are purely radial in these models .",
    "no superposition of radial orbits can self - consistently produce a power - law shallower than @xmath9 at small @xmath10 .",
    "further generalisations to include randomly oriented rosette orbits with a scale - free eccentricity distribution resulted in spherically symmetric similarity solutions for which @xmath11 for all @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in such models the inner density structure of the final haloes reflects the scaling properties of the initial conditions .",
    "in contrast , n - body simulations have shown for more than a decade that dark matter haloes formed from fully 3-dimensional , cosmologically realistic initial conditions do not have pure power - law density profiles .",
    "rather , the logarithmic slope of simulated profiles changes slowly but continuously with radius .",
    "in addition , the shape of these profiles is almost independent of halo mass , of cosmological parameters , and of the power spectrum of initial fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the most popular representation of this `` universal '' shape is the nfw model which behaves as @xmath13 in the inner regions and as @xmath14 in the outskirts @xcite .",
    "even haloes formed by monolithic collapse in the first nonlinear phases of hot and warm dark matter models ( hdm and wdm ) are well represented by nfw fits , showing that hierarchical growth is not required to produce this universality ( see _ e.g. _",
    "recent n - body simulations with significantly increased numerical resolution have found small but significant deviations from nfw shape which depend systematically on halo mass @xcite . thus halo density profiles are not truly universal .",
    "nevertheless , these variations are much smaller than those predicted by the similarity solutions , and the profiles can be considered universal to a good approximation .",
    "the differences in behaviour between similarity solutions and numerical simulations reflect the fact that the former enforce spherical symmetry and a potential which varies smoothly with time according to the similarity scaling , while the latter involve strongly time - dependent and fully three - dimensional potential fluctuations which exchange energy and angular momentum between different parts of the system through the classical `` violent relaxation '' mechanism @xcite .",
    "even though extensions of the original similarity solutions allow non - radial orbits with a variety of eccentricity distributions @xcite , they retain both spherical symmetry and strict similarity scaling , and so exclude violent relaxation and any possibility for it to drive convergence towards a universal ( i.e. @xmath15-independent ) nonlinear structure .",
    "large and time - dependent potential fluctuations are required to produce such convergence .",
    "these occur naturally in hierarchical assembly models but also in other situations , for example , during the monolithic , quasi - ellipsoidal collapse of the first generation of haloes in hdm or wdm cosmogonies .",
    "it has long been known that spherical equilibria dominated by radial orbits are violently unstable and evolve on a few dynamical times into strongly ellipsoidal bars with significant nonradial motions .",
    "the original similarity solutions of @xcite and @xcite are thus not viable models for the formation of real systems  the slightest non - spherical perturbation of their quasi - equilibrium inner regions causes rapid evolution to an entirely different nonlinear structure .",
    "a number of authors have noted situations where the radial orbit instability gives rise to haloes with nfw - like density profiles @xcite .",
    "there are thus ( at least ) two possibilities for the long - term evolution of structure from ( almost ) spherically symmetric , self - similar linear initial conditions .",
    "either it may approach a non - spherical self - similar solution , which would then have a potential which changes smoothly in time and no violent relaxation , or the strongly time - dependent behaviour may continue indefinitely , allowing violent relaxation to rearrange material in the inner regions . in the former case",
    "an nfw - like universal profile is only consistent with similarity scaling for @xmath16 , whereas in the latter case an nfw - like profile could , in principle , be maintained at all times .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate these issues by simulating evolution from spherically symmetric , self - similar , linear initial conditions for a variety of values of @xmath15 . as we showed in @xcite particle noise leads to the rapid onset of the radial orbit instability in such simulations , so that their later nonlinear evolution is strongly non - spherical . here",
    "we show that while some chaotic time - dependence remains at late times , evolution is nevertheless approximately self - similar .",
    "the inner structure of the haloes remembers the initial conditions from which they formed , depending on @xmath15 in the same way as in the spherical similarity solutions . in section [ section : bar ] we present our simulations and study the formation of ellipsoidal `` bars '' . in section [ section : density ]",
    "we study how these bars affect the velocity anisotropy and density profiles in the inner halo .",
    "the transition between the infall and quasi - equilibrium regions , and the inner and outer scales which define it are discussed in section [ section:2scales ] .",
    "finally in section [ section : psd ] we demonstrate that , in contrast to the velocity anisotropy and density profiles , the profile of pseudo - phase - space density is almost universal in these models .",
    "the similarity solutions assume an einstein - de sitter universe in which the linear mass perturbation @xmath17 within a sphere containing unperturbed mass @xmath18 , initially satisfies @xmath19 where @xmath15 is a scaling index and @xmath20 is a reference mass taken to be the mass within the turnaround radius ( @xmath21 ) at the initial time .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is restricted to positive values in order to ensure that more distant mass shells turn around and fall back later than inner ones .",
    "the mass within the shell that is just turning around and the physical radius of this shell at turnaround then scale with time as @xmath22 and @xmath23 so that the mean mass density contained within the turnaround radius is always 5.5 times the cosmic mean ( the critical density ) and so satisfies @xmath24 .",
    "since these initial conditions are spherically symmetric , the system remains spherically symmetric at later times ( if instabilities are ignored / suppressed ) and the particles on each spherical shell all execute identical though differently oriented radial orbits .",
    "the scale - free nature of the initial conditions ensures that the orbits executed by different shells are identical when scaled to their individual turnaround radii and times .",
    "@xcite showed that at radii much smaller than @xmath21 this results in a stable halo with density profile @xmath25 when @xmath26 , the only case they considered .",
    "@xcite generalised this to other values of @xmath15 , finding the inner profile to vary with the initial scaling properties : @xmath27 the change of behaviour at @xmath8 is due to the fact that no self - consistent spherical equilibrium system built from radial orbits can have a power - law slope shallower than @xmath28 , because every particle is constrained to pass through the centre of the system once per orbit .",
    "the full structure of the similarity solution for the case @xmath29 was worked out by @xcite , who showed that the power - law inner structure breaks in the transition to the infall regime , and that the confinement of non - zero phase - space density to a 3-dimensional sheet results in a series of sharp spherical caustics which are superposed on the inner power - law density profile and are located at any given time at the positions of particles currently passing through apocentre .    in this paper",
    "we simulate evolution from initial conditions which obey the spherical similarity solutions , exactly as in @xcite , but for a variety of values of @xmath15 .",
    "we use a fully three - dimensional n - body solver , a version of gadget-2 @xcite , and we allow particle noise to drive the radial orbit instability .",
    "this happens in the first few expansion factors so that the later stages of the simulations all contain fully developed ellipsoidal `` bars '' .",
    "all our simulations follow evolution over a factor of 1000 in time corresponding to expansion of the background cosmology from @xmath30 and until @xmath31 .",
    "the softening length is kept fixed in comoving coordinates at @xmath32 .",
    "the final halo is represented by about @xmath33 particles within @xmath21 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_map ] we show images of the bar in the final state of two of our simulations , @xmath34 on the left and @xmath35 on the right . in each case",
    "the bars extend slightly beyond the position of the outer caustic of the corresponding spherical similarity solution , which we indicate with a green circle .",
    "the location of the actual outer caustic corresponds to the transition in colour from blue to red . in all our simulations",
    "we find bars with semi - major axes ( delineated by the outer caustics ) which are about 1.2 times the radius of the spherical caustic .",
    "thus measured in units of the latter , our bar lengths appear universal . in both the cases shown",
    "there are clear left - right asymmetries in the inner structure of the bars ( the yellow regions ) .",
    "such asymmetry is a clear indicator of time - dependent behaviour  any exact non - spherical similarity solution is expected to be left - right symmetric .",
    "we show the axis - ratios of equidensity surfaces of our final bars as a function of semi - major axis in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : axisratio ] .",
    "these ratios were obtained by calculating the moment of inertia of all particles within an ellipsoidal surface , deriving the eigenvalues and principal axes , and then iterating until the shape and orientation of the bounding ellipsoid are consistent with the orientation and relative axis lengths inferred from the moment of inertia .",
    "these ratios are thus cumulative , referring to all material interior to the quoted radius rather to an ellipsoidal shell at this radius .",
    "the axis ratios take their most extreme values just inside the outer caustic , with all simulations giving minor - to - major values close to 0.2 and intermediate - to - major values close to 0.35 .",
    "they approach unity rapidly at larger radii , and also rise steadily though more slowly towards smaller radii .",
    "there is no clear trend as a function of @xmath15 , suggesting that the exact values may be stochastically determined and perhaps also time - dependent .",
    "we test this in the right panel by replotting the curves using a thick line - style and comparing them with results at @xmath36 , represented by thin lines .",
    "the overall pattern is very similar at the two times .",
    "there is some indication that the deviation of individual models from the mean is coherent between the two times , but there are also substantial variations .",
    "time - dependent effects appear to be influencing the measurements significantly , and these plausibly have a relatively long time coherence . in consequence",
    "it is not possible to decide whether the apparent trends with @xmath15 are real , or just reflect unrelated time - dependent variations .",
    "the overall similarity of all the curves at both times suggest that the shape behaviour is approximately both self - similar and `` universal '' .",
    "the central bar torques infalling particles , inducing non - radial motions which transform the purely radial orbits of the original similarity solution into fully three - dimensional orbits .",
    "this alters both the density and the velocity dispersion structure of the nonlinear regions , as we now illustrate .",
    "a velocity anisotropy parameter is conventionally defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are 1-dimensional radial and transverse velocity dispersions averaged over spherical shells of radius @xmath10 .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : half_time_profiles ] shows @xmath40 at two different times , @xmath36 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath31 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the right panel shows @xmath41 at the same two times .",
    "the two quantities are evaluated using the same set of logarithmically spaced spherical shells .",
    "neither profile changes systematically with time when plotted against @xmath42 , consistent with the expectations of self - similar evolution .    the spherically - averaged density profiles in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : half_time_profiles ] show three distinct regimes . at radii larger than the outer caustic , only one ( infalling ) matter stream is present . here",
    ", there is essentially perfect agreement between @xmath36 and @xmath31 in all cases , and the effective power - law index of the profile is significantly greater than @xmath28 and similar for all @xmath15 . only the position of the outer caustic ( in units of @xmath21 ) varies significantly with @xmath15 . between this outer caustic and the typical radii of particles passing their first pericentre after turnaround , the density profile has a mean effective index which is similar for all @xmath15 and substantially less than @xmath28 .",
    "the behaviour in this regime is quite irregular , however , and there are substantial differences between @xmath36 and @xmath31 in several cases .",
    "examination of phase - space plots ( see , for example , fig",
    ".  8 of @xcite ) suggests that this time - dependence is driven by large - scale irregularities which grow around the first apocentre after turnaround but are washed out by phase - mixing at later times . inside the radius of first pericentre ,",
    "the profiles become more regular and agree well between the two times shown . to a good approximation , they are power laws that are well fitted ( as @xmath43 ) by @xmath44 this is the value expected for a perfect similarity solution in the presence of nonradial motions @xcite , demonstrating that the time - dependent behaviour seen at intermediate radii is not sufficient to destroy the similarity scaling and enforce `` universal '' structure .",
    "note that both the steep slope over the decade immediately inside the outer caustic radius ( which is roughly at the conventional virial radius ) and the break to a shallower slope at smaller radii are qualitatively similar to the `` universal '' behaviour encapsulated by the nfw profile .",
    "however , the inner slope matches the nfw value only for @xmath16 , smaller than any of the values tested here .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : half_time_profiles ] shows that velocity anisotropy profiles are similar for all values of @xmath15 , exhibiting distinct behaviour in the same three regimes seen in the density profiles . at large radii",
    ", particles are falling in for the first time on very nearly radial orbits , gradually gaining angular momentum as they feel the quadrupole moment of the central bar .",
    "as they cross the outer caustic they are mixed with particles which have already passed pericentre , and @xmath40 drops to much smaller values . inside the radius of first pericentre , @xmath40 is almost constant in the quasi - equilibrium region , declining slightly towards the centre . in this region",
    "there appears to be a weak but significant dependence of anisotropy on similarity index , with larger values of @xmath15 giving rise to slightly more radially biased velocity dispersions .",
    "this behaviour is a consequence of the dependence of the inner density profile on @xmath15 . for larger @xmath15",
    "the inner mass distribution is more strongly centrally concentrated , so that its quadrupole moment become less significant relative to the monopole and less angular momentum is induced in the orbits of infalling particles .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : half_time_profiles ] suggests that in the inner part of the halo the @xmath45 parameter may approach an asymptotic value which depends on the value of @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite have proposed that the equation @xmath46 relates velocity anisotropy and density profile slope in the inner parts of dark matter haloes ( see also _",
    "@xcite ) . using eq .",
    "[ eq : profile ] which is indeed valid in the inner part of our haloes , the above relationship reduces to @xmath47 which gives @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with those inferred from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : half_time_profiles ] , even though our haloes form in a quite different ( and `` nonuniversal '' ) manner from cdm haloes .",
    "in the previous section , we found approximate similarity behaviour for nonspherical haloes formed by infall from power - law and almost spherically symmetric initial conditions .",
    "as in the fully spherically symmetric similarity solution of @xcite , the resulting nonlinear density profile is a power law only at sufficiently small radii , but in our case the transition between the infall and quasi - equilibrium regimes is more complex than when the orbits are purely radial . as we have seen , there appear to be two distinct scales : an inner scale at around @xmath50 and an outer scale at around @xmath51 . in the last section we asserted that the former can be associated with the first pericentric passage of infalling particles , and the latter with the following apocentric passage , which occurs at the outer caustic . here",
    "we support these assertions by a more careful study of the radial position of these orbital turning - points .    in the spherical similarity solution ,",
    "the outer caustic is the border between the one- and three - stream regions . outside this radius",
    "all particles are falling in for the first time , while within it many of them have passed through the centre at least once . in fig .",
    "[ fig : caustic - ta ] we show how the radius of this outer caustic , evaluated directly from the similarity solution , increases with @xmath15 . comparison with the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : half_time_profiles ] shows that the sharp change in profile shape which delineates the inner boundary of the infall regime in our simulations is indeed very close to this radius and depends on @xmath15 exactly as predicted .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : half_time_profiles ] , all radii are expressed in units of the turnaround radius .",
    "although this is the natural scale for models with spherically symmetric initial perturbations of the kind studied here , it turns out that scaling to the outer caustic radius ( i.e. the position of the first apocentre after turnaround ) results in greater uniformity of the inner nonlinear structure of our haloes as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "we show this in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaled_profiles ] which may be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : half_time_profiles ] , note that in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaled_profiles ] , the outer transition occurs slightly beyond the nominal outer caustic radius .",
    "this is because we have rescaled using the value for the spherically symmetric similarity solution , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : caustic - ta ] .",
    "this is slightly smaller than caustic radius at the end of our numerical bars , as is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_map ] .",
    "next , we consider the inner scale at around @xmath50 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : half_time_profiles ] ) .",
    "we follow the trajactories of all simulation particles and record the radial position of their first pericentric passage . for all particles which pass first pericentre between @xmath36 and @xmath31",
    ", we follow their radial position @xmath10 along their orbit and record its first minimum , as well as the time when this minimum occurs .",
    "the latter allows us to calculate the position of the outer caustic ( according to the spherical similarity solution ) at the time of pericentric passage , and thus to measure the ratio of these two lengths .",
    "a histogram of @xmath52 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : peri_distance ] .",
    "there is considerable scatter in this ratio because pericentric radius depends strongly on the angle between the infall direction of a particle and the long axis of the bar .",
    "it is very small for infall along one of the principal axes , and it maximises at angles well away from any of these axes .",
    "nevertheless , there is a well - defined `` typical '' pericentric distance which is @xmath53 for all values of @xmath15 .",
    "this agrees well with the inner transition scale of the @xmath45 and density profiles in figs .",
    "[ fig : half_time_profiles ] and  [ fig : scaled_profiles ] .",
    "a property of dark matter haloes with rather intriguing characteristics is the pseudo - phase - space density .",
    "this is defined as , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the mass density and the ( three - dimensional ) velocity dispersion averaged over a shell of radius @xmath10 . even though neither @xmath55 nor @xmath56 is itself close to a power law , this particular combination is very close to a power law for haloes formed from @xmath0cdm initial conditions , and , remarkably , its power - law index is very similar to that found in the spherically symmetric similarity solution of @xcite .",
    "this curiosity was first pointed out by @xcite , and since that time it has been investigated by many authors who have found the behaviour to be quite robust , to extend over more than three decades in radius , and to hold also for other kinds of initial conditions ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    in the framework of a true similarity solution with nonradial motions the inner density profile must obey eq .",
    "[ eq : profile ] for all @xmath57 and @xmath40 must become constant at small radii . since the circular velocity and the velocity dispersions must have the same scaling behaviour ,",
    "the pseudo - phase - space density is also a power law which is easily verified to be @xmath58 for the original similarity solutions of @xcite which had purely radial orbits , this behaviour holds only for @xmath59 .",
    "the specific case @xmath29 studied by @xcite gives @xmath60 .",
    "we have directly evaluated the pseudo - phase - space density profiles of our simulated haloes using logarithmic bins in radius and subtracting the mean radial motion before evaluating the velocity dispersion .",
    "we show the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : pseudo_profiles ] . in the left panel",
    "the radial coordinate is normalised by the turnaround radius and the pseudo - phase - space density by the characteristic value @xmath61 .",
    "the very good agreement between the curves for @xmath36 and for @xmath31 demonstrates that the pseudo - phase - space density evolves self - similarly in time .",
    "this is no surprise , given that we have already seen good scaling for the density and velocity anisotropy profiles .",
    "more surprising is the fact that inside the outer caustic radius the profiles show very little dependence on @xmath15 , either in slope or in amplitude .",
    "furthermore , they are all good approximations to a power law , and there is no obvious feature near the radius of first pericentre despite the very strong features seen at this radius in fig .",
    "[ fig : half_time_profiles ] . once again scaling to the radius of",
    "the outer caustic gives an even better overlap since it matches the break at large radii , as can be seen in the inset in the right panel .",
    "we focus on the innermost part of our haloes ( the regions inside the first pericentre ) in the main plot of the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pseudo_profiles ] .",
    "we again use the outer caustic radius to scale the radii and pseudo - phase - space densities , and we additionally multiply the pseudo - phase - space density by @xmath62 to take out the dominant trend . the power - law slopes expected for exact similarity scaling are indicated by thin straight lines and are seen to be a good but not perfect fit to the simulated behaviour .",
    "the differences are small enough that they can probably be ascribed to residual time - dependent behaviour , an interpretation which is supported by the differences between the @xmath36 and @xmath31 curves for each @xmath15 .",
    "thus , unlike the velocity anisotropy and the density profiles , the pseudo - phase - space density profile is close to a power law over the full nonlinear extent of our haloes and it depends only very weakly on @xmath15 .",
    "thus , to a good approximation it can be considered `` universal '' .",
    "we have shown that although the classic spherically symmetric similarity solutions of @xcite and @xcite are violently unstable to the radial orbit instability , evolution from the initial conditions they presuppose gives rise to ellipsoidal , bar - like haloes which nevertheless grow in an approximately self - similar way .",
    "the nonlinear structure of these objects shows two characteristic radii .",
    "the outer caustic separates the infall and multistream regions and occurs at approximately the same position as in the original spherically symmetric similarity solutions .",
    "the second characeristic radius is about an order of magnitude smaller and occurs at the typical first pericentre distance of the infalling particle stream .",
    "it can be considered the outer edge of the quasi - equilibrium region .",
    "relative to the turnaround radius , both radii increase with the value of the similarity parameter @xmath15 .",
    "both the density and velocity anisotropy profiles show strong features at the first pericentre radius . within this radius",
    "the density profile is approximately a power law , @xmath3 with @xmath11 , and the velocity anisotropy is approximately constant , @xmath63 . at larger",
    "radii the density profile becomes substantially steeper and the velocity anisotropy rises steeply .    despite the strong features in the density and velocity anisotropy profiles at the first pericentre radius , the pseudo - phase - space density profiles of all our haloes are close to power laws all the way out to the outer caustic radius .",
    "furthermore they depend only very weakly on @xmath15 and are similar to the profiles of haloes formed from @xmath0cdm initial conditions .",
