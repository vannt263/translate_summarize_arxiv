    "to get maximum @xmath158 , it is important to introduce spin - scatterer bellow fixed co1 layer , but reduce spin - scattering above co2 free layer , latter one can be realized by reducing volume of material above co2 layer , for example current drain can be thin long nanowire or cover layer with very thin thickness . as most of experimentally studied ( cu / co)@xmath0 structures have infinitely large layers at both ends , @xmath158 inside them is nearly zero .    for ( cu / co)@xmath1 system , maximum @xmath154 ( @xmath158 )",
