    "designing and searching for good thermoelectric materials have a long history of extensive studies due to the scientific interest and potential technological importance , particularly for generating electrical power from heat ( gradients ) and for cooling through the peltier effect @xcite .",
    "hitherto , the main target materials have been various insulators or semiconductors such as bi@xmath0te@xmath3 @xcite and fesb@xmath0@xcite , since it was believed that huge thermopowers can not be expected for metals .",
    "however , recently , novel metallic systems with large thermopower have been discovered and attracted much attention .",
    "generally , materials with strong electronic correlations are promising @xcite ; and a famous example is na@xmath2coo@xmath0 , for which a metallic resistivity as low as @xmath4=0.2 m@xmath5 cm and a thermopower as large as @xmath6=100 @xmath7v / k are observed simultaneously at 300k @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of low resistivity and large thermopower results in a large power factor ( @xmath8 ) , which is especially important for device applications .",
    "most recently , okamoto _ et al . _ synthesized a new mixed - valent spinel oxide , lirh@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite .",
    "this novel oxide shows two structural phase transitions , i.e. , the cubic - to - tetragonal transition at 230k and the tetragonal - to - orthorhombic transition at 170k .",
    "particularly interesting is however the high temperature cubic phase : despite the metalicity which is reflected in a small resistivity and the existence of a fermi - edge , the thermopower is as large as @xmath9v / k at 800k , which is exceptional for metallic systems .    on the theoretical side , a variety of studies",
    "have been performed to understand the mechanism of large thermopowers in metallic systems . among others ,",
    "koshibae _ et al .",
    "_ derived an expression for the seebeck coefficient of strongly correlated systems in the high - temperature limit @xcite . considering the orbital and spin degrees of freedom of localized electrons",
    ", they estimated the thermoelectric power of na@xmath2coo@xmath0 to be 150 @xmath7v / k .",
    "however , when the temperature ( @xmath10 ) is much lower than the energy scale of the band width ( @xmath11 ev ) , it is expected that the band dispersion of the system also plays a crucial role as has been suggested from first principle ( bandstructure ) studies @xcite .",
    "indeed , recently , two of the present authors proposed that the peculiar shape of the valence band ( the so - called @xmath12 band ) is important to realize a large thermopower and high conductivity in na@xmath2coo@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the different theoretical proposals led to a heated discussion @xcite and also to a proposal to discriminate between them through the respective temperature dependence @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the present study is to clarify the origin of the large thermopower in lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 . for this purpose",
    ", we first perform a lda+dmft @xcite calculation ( the combination of the local density approximation and the dynamical mean field theory@xcite ) , employing the kubo formula for the seebeck coefficient @xcite .",
    "this _ ab initio _ approach is going way beyond ref .",
    "where several phenomenological parameters had to be introduced .",
    "second , we study whether the boltzmann equation approach with the lda band dispersion as an input works well for this system",
    ". we will show that this approach gives results quantitatively similar to those of lda+dmft . even though lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 is a material very different from na@xmath2coo@xmath0 , having among others a much more complicated bandstructure",
    ", our analysis nontheless reveals that the origin of the large thermopower is similar : the `` pudding mold '' shape of the bands crossing the fermi energy .",
    "this outcome was not prejudiced in our investigation and is quite surprising .",
    "we also discuss how electron doping could further increase the power factor of lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "as a first step we do a lda calculation for lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 , using the linearized muffin tin orbital ( lmto ) basis set @xcite , employing the experimental lattice constant @xmath13 and so - called @xmath14 parameter @xmath15 ( which indicates the position of the oxygen sites ) .    from the lmto bandstructure , we construct an effective hamiltonian ( @xmath16 by the projection onto wannier functions @xcite . since the unit cell of lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 contains four rh atoms and each rh atom has three @xmath17 orbitals the size of the effective hamiltonian is 12@xmath1812 .",
    "a comparison of the band dispersion of this effective hamiltonian with the total lda band structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lda ] .",
    "in contrast to the case of na@xmath2coo@xmath0 @xcite , not only the @xmath12-orbital but also the @xmath19-orbitals have a substantial density of states ( see the right panel of fig.[fig : lda ] ) at the fermi level ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "hence , we can not extract a simpler effective hamiltonian from the 12 @xmath18 12 hamiltonian and need to keep all @xmath17 orbitals in the following calculation .",
    "right panel : partial @xmath12 and @xmath21 density of states for the model .",
    ", width=321 ]    next , we supplement the 3-orbital hamiltonian by local intra- ( @xmath22 ) and inter - orbital ( @xmath23 ) coulomb repulsions as well as by hund s exchange ( @xmath24 ; of ising type ) , and solve it by dmft@xcite , using the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method . to get high - quality qmc data , we take @xmath25 sweeps in the calculation . in the framework of dmft ,",
    "the kubo formula for the seebeck coefficient is @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the boltzmann constant and unit charge , respectively , and @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the spectral function , i.e. , the imaginary part of the green function @xmath31 ; @xmath32 is the group velocity , @xmath33 the fermi - dirac distribution function , and @xmath34 the volume of the unit cell .    as is carefully discussed in ref .",
    ", when the tight - binding basis is well localized in the real space , we can use the so - called peirls approximation , @xmath35@xcite . in this method , since we have an analytical expression of @xmath36 , the mesh for the momentum sum in eq.([seebeckeq2 ] ) can be arbitrarily dense . in most cases",
    "we took a 40@xmath1840@xmath1840 mesh , but in some cases also a 80@xmath1880@xmath1880 mesh for checking convergence .",
    "usually , @xmath31 is calculated in dmft(qmc ) from the self energy @xmath37 which is obtained as a root from the local green function @xmath38 , obtained in turn from the qmc data by the maximum entropy method ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . however",
    ", this standard approach does not work well for the calculation of the seebeck coefficient because of the following : since @xmath39 only contributes to @xmath40 for @xmath41 , we need @xmath37 for small @xmath42 . for such frequencies",
    "@xmath37 is quite small ( smaller than 0.1ev for @xmath41 , see below ) . as is pointed out in ref .",
    ", this smallness makes it difficult to calculate @xmath37 reliably especially by a probability - based algorithms such as the maximum entropy method .",
    "hence , in the present study , we calculate @xmath37 directly from @xmath43 , using both the pade approximation and a polynomial fit . for the former ,",
    "we apply the algorithm proposed in ref .   to the data with @xmath44$]ev . for the latter , we fit @xmath43 for @xmath45$]ev to @xmath46 by a standard least - squares fit .",
    "since only the behavior at small @xmath42 is relevant for the seebeck coefficient , we can expect the polynomial fit to give reasonable results .",
    "the pade approximation might become problematic if poles are present in the vicinity of the real-@xmath47 axis .",
    "however , as we will see below , the resulting @xmath37 for the present case does not show any anomalous behavior for small @xmath42 , which implies that the pade approximation is not problematic .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] , we plot @xmath37 for @xmath48ev which was estimated in ref .   and @xmath4930 , 34 , 40 ev@xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath51k , the main contribution stems from @xmath52$]ev . for these energies",
    "pade approximation and polynomial fit give similar results . even though the agreement is not perfect , differences are small , i.e. , of @xmath53 ev .",
    "thus we employ @xmath37 of both , pade approximation and polynomial fitting , in the following lda+dmft calculation of the seebeck coefficient .",
    "the difference gives us an estimate for the accuracy of our calculation .",
    "besides the lda+dmft study , we also performed calculations based on the boltzmann equation .",
    "the seebeck coefficient can be estimated by calculating @xmath54 here , @xmath55 is the relaxation time which we assume to be independent of @xmath56 ; @xmath57 are the eigenvalues of @xmath58 ; and @xmath59 the diagonal elements of @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the unitary transformation which diagonalizes @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath62 can be roughly estimated as @xmath63 apart from a constant factor@xcite . here",
    ", @xmath64 is a summation over the states in the range of @xmath65 , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are typical velocities for the states below and above the fermi level , respectively .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : s ] , we show the resulting seebeck coefficient calculated by the lda+dmft method and the boltzmann equation approach",
    ". we also plot the result of the constant-@xmath55 approximation for the kubo formula , i.e. , we assume @xmath68 for eqs .",
    "( [ seebeckeq1])-([seebeckeq2 ] ) .",
    "method as well as by lda+dmft , using both the pade approximation and a polynomial fit for the self energy .",
    ", width=302 ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig : s ] , we see that ( 1 ) the boltzmann equation and the constant-@xmath55 approximation for the kubo formula give almost the same result ; ( 2 ) the constant-@xmath55 approximation gives a larger thermopower than lda+dmft ; ( 3 ) this smaller lda+dmft thermopower is closer to experiment @xcite , already for ( @xmath69)=(3.1,1.7,0.7)ev @xcite but even more so for somewhat smaller values of the coulomb interaction .",
    "point ( 1 ) demonstrates that the calculation via eq .",
    "( [ seebeckeq1 ] ) is working well , if @xmath37 is correct .",
    "point ( 2 ) can be understood from the behavior of @xmath70 : fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] , shows that @xmath70 calculated by the lda+dmft method is large for negative @xmath47 but small for positive @xmath47 ( independently of pade approximation and polynomial fit ) .",
    "this means that , in contrast to the constant-@xmath55 approximation , the actual life time of quasi - holes is longer than that for quasi - particles . therefore , the contribution of the quasi - holes ( particles ) to @xmath71 in eq.([seebeckeq1 ] ) becomes larger ( smaller ) in the lda+dmft calculation , and consequently the first moment , @xmath72 , becomes smaller . here , it should be noted that the constant-@xmath55 approximation does not correspond to the limit of @xmath73 , since this asymmetry of life time exists even in the weak coupling limit .",
    "this is the reason why the results of lda+dmft move away from those of the constant-@xmath55 approximation as @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are decreased .    as for point ( 3 )",
    ", we would like to note that the correlations renormalize the bandwidth .",
    "this renormalization is calculated microscopically here whereas it has been adjusted to the angle - resolved photoemission spectrum in ref .  .",
    "while there are some differences between boltzmann equation approach and lda+dmft , the results are still very similar , even _",
    "quantitatively_. hence , we may expect that , in the present case , the boltzmann equation can be used as a convenient tool to analyze the mechanism of the large thermopower , or even to design more efficient thermoelectric materials .",
    "let us first examine whether the mechanism proposed for na@xmath2coo@xmath0 in ref . can work also in lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "if the valence band has a peculiar shape of dispersion which is dispersive below the @xmath20 but somewhat flat above ( the so - called `` pudding - mold '' type ) , @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ seebeckeq3 ] ) becomes large , since the group velocity above @xmath20 ( @xmath75 ) is much larger than the one below @xmath20 ( @xmath76 ) in this case .",
    "this is the basic idea of ref . how to realize a large thermopower and a low resistivity at the same time@xcite . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vel2all ] , we plot the group velocity squared for lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 within the energy window of @xmath77 at @xmath78k . we see that @xmath75 is indeed larger than @xmath76 , confirming this mechanism .",
    "we note here that although the rh valence is + 3.5 in lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 , the degeneracy of @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 orbitals in the cubic phase makes the number of holes _ per band _ small , resulting in a situation similar to na@xmath2coo@xmath0 with the co valence smaller than + 3.5 .",
    "this view is consistent with the experimental fact that the thermopower is suppressed in the tetragonal phase below 230k , where the degeneracy is lifted.@xcite    ) along different directions of the fisrt brillouin zone for rh@xmath82 ( lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 ; upper panel ) and rh@xmath83 ( electron - doped lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 ; lower panel ) . @xmath84",
    "point above the fermi energy @xmath20 are shown in yellow , those below @xmath20 in red . , width=321 ]    however , we also see that the ( squared ) group velocity above @xmath20 is still large for some @xmath84-points .",
    "in fact , for lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 , there are two pudding mold bands . for the rh valence of + 3.5",
    ", @xmath20 lies near the bending point of one of the pudding mold bands , but also cuts through the dispersive portion of the other ( see the upper inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : vel2all ] ) .",
    "the former enhances the thermopower , while the latter suppresses it .",
    "this might be the reason why lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 is not such a good thermoelectric material as na@xmath2coo@xmath0 .        to enhance the thermopower in lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "we suggest the following possibility : if we dope electrons to this system , one of the pudding mold bands will be brought completely below @xmath20 ( see the lower inset of fig . [",
    "fig : vel2all ] ) .",
    "the second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vel2all ] shows the group velocity squared for such a doped system with rh valence + 3.08 . in this case , the group velocity squared above @xmath20 is small for the entire brillouin zone .    to confirm this idea",
    ", we calculate the thermopower and the power factor ( normalized by its value at rh valence=+3.5 ) for various rh valences by means of the boltzmann equation approach @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : val - seeb - pwf0026 ] .",
    "the results indicate a maximal power factor ( @xmath85 ) at a valency of + 3.08 , where it is almost four times larger than for lirh@xmath0o@xmath1 . while the orbital degeneracy of @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 already plays a crucial role to make @xmath20 be higher than those of single - orbital systems@xcite , realizing this situation experimentally is an interesting challenge which seems to be feasible .",
