    "the disorder induced metal - insulator transition , a genuine quantum phase transition is one of the most studied phenomena of condensed matter physics since the seminal paper published over five decades ago .  @xcite according to the original problem , the hamiltonian @xmath7 describes the behavior of non - interacting spinless electrons in disorder . the first term in eq .",

    "( [ eq : am ] ) is the kinetic energy describing the hopping of the particles over a regular lattice , but restricted to nearest neighbors only .",
    "the energy scale associated to the hopping process , @xmath11 , can be taken as the unit of energy ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the sites form a regular , usually simple cubic lattice .",
    "the embedding dimension , @xmath13 , of the system is a very important parameter , since phase transition occurs for @xmath14 only .",
    "@xcite    besides diagonal disorder resembling substitutional disorder the other main cause of irregularity in condensed systems is structural disorder .",
    "for the investigation of topological and structural disorder percolation is one of the most important and widely used models .",
    "percolation in general has a wide applicability in many fields of physics .",
    "@xcite in the bernoulli site - percolation problem every site is filled with probability @xmath15 and is empty with probability @xmath16 independently .",
    "the main goal of classical percolation is to tell for a given @xmath15 whether an infinite cluster of filled sites may exist in the thermodynamical limit or not .",
    "it turns out , that there is such a critical probability , @xmath17 , below which , @xmath18 , there is no infinite cluster but above which , @xmath19 , there is . in one dimension",
    "@xcite @xmath20 , in two dimensions  @xcite @xmath21 , in three dimensions  @xcite @xmath22 . in the @xmath19 case",
    "the existence of an infinite cluster ensures that the system can be treated as a conductor , since classical particles can travel through the whole system . on the other hand if @xmath18 , the system consists of a set of disjoint , finite clusters , and as a consequence , it behaves as an insulator , since no particle can escape from its initial finite cluster .    for the electric conduction properties of a sample the electrons are responsible",
    "whose behavior is described very well by quantum mechanics , therefore we shall investigate spinless non  interacting electrons on a percolated lattice , this is called the quantum percolation model . omitting spin and interaction is necessary , because even with these simplifications the problem seems to be hard to solve .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the set of filled sites , @xmath25 is a constant on  site energy , whose value can be safely set to zero without loss of generality .",
    "note that the pure site ",
    "percolation problem is equivalent to a binary anderson model  @xcite with constant @xmath26 and @xmath27 but taking the limit @xmath28 : @xmath29 this hamiltonian could describe an alloy of a perfect metal consisting of atoms @xmath24 and a perfect insulator consisting of atoms @xmath30 only .",
    "all @xmath24 sites are equivalent , and the @xmath30 sites can not be reached due to their infinite on - site energy , therefore @xmath30 sites behave as if they were empty .",
    "this suggests , that quantum percolation behaves similar to the anderson model . in our present work",
    "we shall show many similarities .",
    "the most important similarity with the anderson problem is the existence of a metal  insulator transition for the quantum percolation model too , however , here @xmath15 , or strictly speaking @xmath31 , plays the role of disorder : for @xmath18 every state is localized onto finite , connected islands , thus the sample is an insulator .",
    "increasing @xmath15 beyond @xmath17 , however , a classical particle can travel through the sample , the electron wave functions are localized due to strong interference effects caused by disorder , the sample still remains an insulator .",
    "for @xmath15 values slightly below @xmath32 states are perturbed bloch - states , the sample is a metal . in between",
    "there exists a mobility edge , @xmath33 , an energy ",
    "dependent quantum critical point , below which electronic eigenstates are anderson - localized giving rise to an insulator , and above which they are extended forming a metal . along the mobility edge , @xmath33 ,",
    "the states are supposed to be multifractals . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fss_qperc ] we argue , that the anderson model and the quantum percolation model belong to the same universality class .    the organization of the paper is the following .",
    "in the next section , sec .  [",
    "sec : theory ] we look at the peculiar properties of the density of states in quantum percolation and provide an overview about multifractality together with an introduction about the finite - size scaling analysis of the corresponding generalized dimensions .",
    "[ subsec : fss_anderson ] we give a short overview of the technique of the latter analysis in the case of the 3d anderson transition , in sec .",
    "[ sec : fss_qperc ] we provide with the methods applied in the present work , and in sect .",
    "[ sec : gmfe_qperc ] we present the results of our analysis for the multifractal analysis .",
    "finally sec .",
    "[ sec : summ ] is left for a summary .",
    "electronic conduction is only possible on an infinite cluster , so @xmath34 is expected , therefore the infinite cluster should be investigated , so only the @xmath19 regime is interesting for us . since numerically we can deal with a finite lattice only , we restricted our work on the largest finite cluster found by a hoshen - kopelman algorithm  @xcite . in a finite size sample",
    "the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : qperc_qperchami ] ) is a huge sparse matrix . to obtain the spectrum and eigenfunctions we used the jacobi - davidson method encoded in the primme package  @xcite with ilu preconditioning , using the ilupack package  @xcite .",
    "at first let us take a glance at the density of states ( dos ) because for the quantum percolation problem it deserves a special attention .",
    "the dos of the giant cluster has itself an unusual form .",
    "the evolution of this function with @xmath15 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : qperc_dos ] . with increasing disorder , in the present case",
    "this means decreasing @xmath15 , more and more sharp peaks appear in the spectrum .",
    "these peaks correspond to special , so - called  molecular states  , which are localized to a few sites  @xcite .",
    "these states are non - zero on a few sites only and exactly zero on every other one due to exact destructive interference .",
    "therefore they are not localized in the sense of anderson localization , there is no exponential decay in the wave function envelope .",
    "typical few - site structures and corresponding energies are given on the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : qperc_dos ] .",
    "since the value @xmath35 appears for most clusters as an eigenvalue , the highest peak of the dos is at the middle of the band , and there is also a pseudo  gap around it .",
    "c c c    figure1a ( 0,70)(a )    &    figure1b ( 0,70)(b )    & [ 2]*[3.5 cm ]    figure1e ( 0,103)(e )     +    figure1c ( 0,70)(c )    &    figure1d ( 0,70)(d )    & +    considering other few - site clusters there is no reason for the eigenvalues to avoid any part of the band , therefore peaks in the dos corresponding to molecular states should appear densely in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the energy of a molecular state is a strict value , thus the peaks in the dos appear as a series of dirac - deltas .",
    "as we can see , the spectrum consists of two parts : a dense point spectrum due to molecular states , and a continuous one due to all other states .",
    "@xcite this statement has been rigorously proven recently in the case of a 2d square lattice , and for tree graphs corresponding to an effective infinite dimension , therefore it is conjectured to be true in any dimension .",
    "@xcite    since molecular states are strongly localized , they can not contribute to conduction .",
    "therefore we restrict our investigation to the continuous part of the spectrum only . with the numerical method described above",
    "we are able to compute one single eigenstate of the hamiltonian having an eigenenergy close to a given value of @xmath36 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qperc_dos ] it is shown , that in a finite system molecular states appear frequently at few special energies only , e.g. @xmath37 , therefore for our purpose we have chosen energy windows avoiding the peaks in the dos .    the cubic lattice is a bipartite lattice and the hamiltonian ( [ eq : qperc_qperchami ] ) couples nearest neighbors only , therefore from one sublattice , @xmath38 , it is possible to hop to the other sublattice , @xmath39 , only . the hamiltonian anticommutes with an operator @xmath40 , which is @xmath32 on sublattice @xmath38 , and @xmath41 on sublattice @xmath39 , thus @xmath40 acts as a chirality transformation .",
    "@xcite therefore the quantum percolation model is symmetric not only on average for the exchange of eigenenergies , @xmath42 , but for every single disorder realization . in the low ( high )",
    "energy range the states have antibonding ( bonding ) character . in the middle of the band , around @xmath35 , chessboard - like",
    "chiral states appear .",
    "these chiral states exactly at @xmath35 are eigenfunctions of @xmath40 , as well , therefore they are protected against off - diagonal disorder .    in order to understand the sub gap appearing around the middle of the band , @xmath35",
    ", we invoke the arguments of ref .  .",
    "the square of the hamiltonian , @xmath43 , connects the sites of the same sublattice only , see fig .",

    "but the hopping elements to the diagonal - lying second neighbors in fig .  [ fig : qperc_renorm_hami ] introduce triangles . triangles and the antibonding nature together lead to frustration . based on the frustration of the states around zero energy naumis _ et .",
    "@xcite showed in two dimensions , that the width of the pseudogap around zero energy , @xmath44 , is connected to the peak at @xmath35 : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 stands for the weight of the zero energy states in the spectra .",
    "they also showed , that the width of the pseudogap tends to zero in the non - disordered limit , @xmath47 .",
    "the extension of these arguments to three dimensions should be valid , since the most important ingredient of their calculation is the coordination number of the lattice , and not the dimensionality itself explicitly .",
    "the states close to @xmath35 belong to the edge of the spectrum of @xmath43 , which is a disordered hamiltonian .",
    "therefore the pseudogap might be qualitatively interpreted as the lifshitz tail of @xmath43 , leading to localized states close @xmath35 .      in recent high - precision calculations",
    "@xcite the so - called multifractal exponents ( mfe ) have been used to describe the anderson metal  insulator transition ( amit ) .",
    "the renormalization flow of the amit as mentioned in the introduction has three fixed points : a metallic , an insulating and a critical one . in the metallic fixed point",
    "every state is extended with probability one , thus with increasing system size , the effective size of the states also grows proportional to the volume .",
    "so the fractal dimension of the states , that will be defined more precisely later , is just the embedding dimension @xmath48-independently , @xmath49 . in the insulating fixed point",

    "we formulate two cases : at first fixing @xmath102 then fixing @xmath56 .",

    "[ sec : mfss ] ) .    in order to fit the scaling law ( [ eq : fss_anderson_scalinglaw ] ) we used minuit . to find the best fit to the data obtained numerically the order of expansion of @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath115 must be decided by choosing the values of @xmath136 and @xmath137 . since the relevant operator is more important than the irrelevant one we always used @xmath138 and @xmath139 . to choose the order of the expansion we used basically three criteria .",
    "the first criterion we took into account was how close the ratio @xmath140 approached one .",
    "@xmath141 is the sum of the squared differences between the data points and the best fit weighted by the inverse variance of the data points , and @xmath142 is the number of degrees of freedom , namely the number of data points minus the number of fit parameters .",
    "a ratio @xmath143 means , that the deviations from the best fit are in the order of the standard deviation .",
    "the second criterion was , that the fit has to be stable against changing the expansion orders , i.e. adding a few new expansion terms . from the fits that fulfilled the first two criteria we chose the simplest model , with the lowest expansion orders .",
    "sometimes we also took into account the error bars , and we chose the model with the lowest error bar for the most important quantities ( @xmath144 , _ etc _ ... ) , if similar models fulfilled the first two criteria .",
    "the error bars of the best fit parameters were obtained by a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the data points are results of averaging , so due to central limit theorem they have a gaussian distribution .",
    "therefore we generated gaussian random numbers with parameters corresponding the mean and standard deviation of the raw data points and then found the best fit . repeating this procedure @xmath145 times provided us the distribution of the fit parameters .",
    "we chose @xmath146 confidence level to obtain the error bars .",
    "we performed fss for @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the results were very similar to the ones obtained by rodriguez _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in the @xmath48-range we investigated the results",

    "the numerical values of @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 have been obtained in excellent agreement with the results of ref .  .",
    "hence we concluded , that our method has been confirmed .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is , that the constant term of @xmath104 does not equal to the corresponding mfe , since @xmath102 is fixed instead of tending to zero .",
    "it would be possible to perform multifractal finite size scaling ( mfss ) at different @xmath102-s , and then obtain the mfes for @xmath152 .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to investigate the quantum percolation problem , where a fraction of lattice points is missing . in this case performing the coarse graining technique defined above immediate difficulties arise .",
    "it is not clear how the @xmath56-sized boxes have to be made , or how the boxes containing different number of filled sites should be compared .",
    "one way to resolve this problem is to choose @xmath112 , meaning that a box contains only one site .",
    "eventhough this choice eventually opens the possibility to extend the mfss method for irregular lattices or even for graphs and networks in the future , there is also a huge cost to be paid : the smoothing effect of the coarse graining is lost , and only the more complicated method of fixed-@xmath56 technique described in sec .",
    "[ fss_fixed_l ] remains .",
    "there is always some numerical noise on the data , which becomes even more relevant for the smallest wave function components . in case of",
    "negative @xmath48 these uncertain small values are dominating the sums in @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( see .",
    "( [ eq : sqrq ] ) ) .",
    "coarse graining clearly suppresses this effect , because for @xmath153 in an @xmath154 sized box positive and negative errors can cancel each other .",
    "another effect is , that in a box large and small wave function amplitudes appear together with high probability . this way the relative error of a @xmath61 box probability",
    "is reduced with coarse graining , in other words coarse graining has a nice smoothing effect . at fixed @xmath112",

    "this makes every attempt to get results for negative @xmath48 very hard if not impossible .",
    "the other problem is , that the scaling law becomes more complicated , the leading number of fit parameters are growing as @xmath121 for fixed @xmath112 , instead of @xmath122 as for fixed @xmath102 .    performing the mfss another problem appeared with eq .",

    "suppresses the irrelevant part .",
    "this caused really large errors in the @xmath159 , and made the whole irrelevant part meaningless .    to find out whether this is just a numerical problem or there is also some systematic physical reason behind this behavior we modeled the above problem :",
    "first a dataset was made by evaluating the expression ( [ eq : fss_anderson_gammal ] ) at system sizes and disorder we used before , with some expansion parameter values similar to the ones provided by previous mfss procedures .",
    "of course fitting eq .",
    "( [ eq : fss_anderson_gammal ] ) to this dataset gave a perfect fit . now adding some small random noise to the initial dataset started to shift the resulting fit parameters a little .",
    "by increasing the noise to the order of the standard deviation of the original dataset for the anderson model the fit showed the expected phenomenon : the irrelevant exponent , @xmath151 , converged to either large or small values .",
    "this shows , that this is just a numerical artifact .",
    "there is a shift on the @xmath160 curves for different system sizes , see fig .",
    "[ fig : qperc_fss_alphaqdq_raw ] .",
    "this shift comes mainly from the @xmath161 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fss_anderson_gammal ] ) , and if noise is present it is numerically hard to determine the effect of the @xmath158 irrelevant part .",
    "all in all , however , in a finite system irrelevant operators are always present , considering an irrelevant term will only increase the error of the fit parameters .",
    "therefore it seems to be useful to drop the irrelevant part , and keep the relevant one only . this way the fitting function reads as @xmath162    we performed mfss in the range @xmath163 with this formula at fixed @xmath112 for the anderson model . similarly to the case of fixed @xmath102 at fixed energy , @xmath36 , and @xmath48 one has to decide the order of the taylor - expansion of the @xmath113 scaling function . to do this we used similar criteria as before .",
    "the only difference was , that unfortunately the fits were not so stable against changing the expansion orders , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , as the ones for fixed @xmath102 , because at fixed @xmath112 we had to fit much more parameters to the same amount of data .",
    "the value of the critical point must be @xmath48-independent , which  contrary to the case of fixed @xmath102  we had to keep also as a criterion .",
    "we had to compare fits at different @xmath48 values and choose the lowest expansion orders that led to a @xmath48-independent critical point , and still had @xmath140 ratio close to one . in some cases we also had to leave out the smallest system size(s ) ,",
