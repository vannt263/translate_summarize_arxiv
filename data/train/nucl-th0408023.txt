    "event - by - event fluctuations in heavy - ion collisions have been recently measured both at cern sps and bnl rhic ( see a brief review @xcite ) .",
    "the data ( usually used @xmath0 or @xmath1 measures to quantify the fluctuations of transverse momentum ) which show a non - trivial behavior as a function of collision centrality , have been theoretically discussed from very different points of view , including complete or partial equilibration , critical phenomena , string or cluster percolation , production of jets . in spite of these efforts",
    "a mechanism responsible for the fluctuations is far from being uniquely identified .    in @xcite",
    "we have established connection of the @xmath1-measure with the fluctuations of multiplicity and advocated that fluctuations of transverse momentum are practically irrelevant for the considered problem , i.e. , for the apparent structure seen in collision centrality dependence .",
    "we argue @xcite that the non - trivial behavior of the so called transverse momentum fluctuations ( quantified by @xmath0 or @xmath1 - measure ) can be fully explained by the multiplicity fluctuations .",

    "the aim of this paper is to show that the observed effect ( non - monotonic dependence of the ratio @xmath12 on the number of projectile participants @xmath13 , i.e. , on the production volume @xmath14 ) stem from the correlations between produced particles and the correlations are of nuclear and electromagnetic interactions origin .",
