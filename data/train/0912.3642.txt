    "one of the big challenges of the past decade has been the construction of renormalizable quantum field theories ( qfts ) on non - commutative space - time , usually plagued by the infamous uv / ir mixing problem  @xcite . only in very special cases",
    "has this task been successful so far , namely in the case of scalar field theories formulated in even dimensional @xmath1-deformed euclidean space : in fact , three such renormalizable models are known today , the first of which being the so - called grosse - wulkenhaar model  @xcite . in that model ,",
    "the action is supplemented by an oscillator - like term which modifies the propagator in such a way that it becomes langmann - szabo invariant  @xcite ( just like the modified action , in fact ) .    motivated by the success of the grosse - wulkenhaar model , some non - commutative gauge field models including similar oscillator - like terms in the action were put forward in refs .",
    "the current work mainly deals with loop calculations based on the previous letter  @xcite , aiming to clarify whether the action we proposed there can lead to a renormalizable non - commutative gauge theory . in doing so",
    ", we find effective one - loop contributions to the action showing great similarities to the so - called `` induced gauge theories '' with oscillator terms which were put forward in  @xcite .",
    "these findings lead us to the conclusion , that ( even though we do not claim to have solved the many problems concerning non - commutative gauge field theories in general , as was discussed in  @xcite ) the implementation of a grosse - wulkenhaar oscillator term into gauge theories seems to be a promising ansatz for a renormalizable non - commutative gauge theory .",
    "however , it also seems to be necessary to do this in a gauge invariant manner , i.e. to consider an action derived by ( or motivated from ) the `` induced gauge theories '' .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : action_and_properties ] briefly reviews the action and its symmetries followed by section  [ sec:1loop ] where some one - loop results are presented .",
    "we finally compare the effective action with the induced gauge theory of  @xcite in section  [ sec : conclusion ] and discuss the consequences .",
    "in the simplest case of @xmath2-deformed space - time , one considers a constant commutator @xmath3 } \\equiv   x^{\\mu } \\star x^{\\nu } -x^{\\nu } \\star x^{\\mu } = { { \\rm i}}{\\theta}^{\\mu \\nu}$ ] , i.e. a heisenberg algebra for the space - time coordinates , realized through the so - called groenewold - moyal @xmath4-product  @xcite .",

    "one derives the slavnov - taylor identity @xmath21 with @xmath22 equation ( [ slavnov_taylor_identities ] ) describes the symmetry content with respect to .",
    "when taking its functional derivative with respect to @xmath23 and @xmath14 and then setting all fields to zero one arrives at @xmath24 usually one would expect to obtain the transversality condition for the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) two - point graph .",
    "however , in this case the oscillator term breaks gauge invariance and hence transversality , as can bee seen from the equation above : instead one has a ward identity relating the 1pi two - point graph to a three - point graph involving the new field @xmath11 .",
    "graphically we can express this relation as depicted in figure  [ almost_transversality_relation ] .",
    "the bilinear parts of the action lead to the following gauge field and ghost propagators in momentum space : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the so - called mehler kernel @xmath27 which is going to be responsible for improving the ir behaviour of the model . in the limit @xmath28 these propagators reduce to the usual ones , i.e. @xmath29 this can be easily verified by integrating over one of the arguments in the mehler kernel : @xmath30 in the following sections we will discuss some one - loop properties of this model , but first some comments are in order : in contrast to the usual situation , the multiplier field @xmath9 appears in a @xmath31 vertex ( in addition to the @xmath32 and @xmath33 propagators ) .",
    "however , since the new multiplier @xmath11 does not propagate , it is impossible to build a graph including these additional feynman rules , but with only external gauge field legs .",
    "in fact , these are the types of graphs we are going to concentrate on in the following , and hence the feynman rules including the fields @xmath9 and @xmath34 are ignored for now .",
    "before starting the explicit calculations , we may derive estimations for the `` worst case '' , i.e. the superficial degree of ultraviolet divergence , which via uv / ir mixing is directly related to the degree of non - commutative ir divergence .",
    "we take into account the powers of internal momenta @xmath35 each feynman rule contributes and also that each loop integral over 4-dimensional space increases the degree by 4 .",
    "for example , the gauge boson propagator usually behaves like @xmath36 for large @xmath35 and therefore reduces the degree of divergence by 2 , whereas each ghost vertex contributes one power of @xmath35 to the numerator of a graph , hence increasing the degree by one .",
    "however , in the present model all propagators , being essentially mehler kernels , depend on two momenta which additionally need to be integrated in loop calculations .",
    "taking into account these considerations for all feynman rules we arrive at @xmath37 where the @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the number of the various types of internal lines and vertices , respectively .",
    "the number of loop integrals @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 furthermore , we take into account the relations @xmath42 between the various feynman rules describing how they ( and how many ) can be connected to one another .",
    "the @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the number of external lines of the respective fields .",
    "using these relations one can eliminate all internal lines and vertices from the power counting formula and arrive at @xmath47 for the gauge boson self - energy we therefore expect the degree of divergence ( uv and non - commutative ir ) to be at worst quadratically .",
    "gauge invariance usually reduces the degree of uv divergence to be merely logarithmic .",
    "however , due to the ward identity whose right hand side is non - zero , the uv divergence will in fact be worse in our case , namely quadratic .",
    "the two possible one - point functions ( tadpoles ) of this model at one - loop level are depicted in figure  [ fig : tadpoles ] .        according to the feynman rules given in and in appendix  [ app : vertices ] , the sum of tadpole graphs",
