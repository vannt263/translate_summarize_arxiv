    "<S> these metrics will be called ideal and hyper - ideal hyperbolic polyhedral metrics . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a hyper - ideal hyperbolic polyhedral metric is determined up to isometry by its curvature and a decorated ideal hyperbolic polyhedral metric is determined up to isometry and change of decorations by its curvature . </S>",
    "<S> the main tool used in the proof is the fenchel dual of the volume function . </S>"
