    "more recently discovery of hidden symmetries of equations for a classical string led to the discovery of integrability @xcite , which stimulated a great progress in understanding of string dynamics and gauge / gravity duality ( see @xcite for the review and list of references ) . to gain additional insights into properties of quantum gravity and strong interactions it is very important to look for new examples of integrable string backgrounds . since at low energies strings behave as point  like particles , integrable structures must give rise to hidden symmetries of supergravity , which will be investigated in this article .",
    "integrability of classical strings on certain backgrounds is guaranteed by an infinite number of conserved quantities which can be extracted from reformulating the dynamical equations as a linear lax pair @xcite .",

    "interestingly , there exists a procedure for demonstrating that a particular background does not have a lax pair , and it has been applied in @xcite to rule out several promising candidates , such as strings on a conifold and on asymptotically  flat geometry produced by d3 branes . unfortunately , this procedure for ruling out integrability is rather complicated , and it has to be applied on a case  by  case basis , so in @xcite we used a different approach based on the study of geodesics . since at low energies strings",
    "behave as point particles , integrability must survive as a hidden symmetry of such objects , and this gives a very coarse necessary condition for integrability , which can be tested for large classes of backgrounds .",

    "this article is a continuation of the program initiated in @xcite : it extends the earlier results to geometries without supersymmetry , and , more importantly , it uncovers the hidden symmetries underlying integrability of geodesics . in spite of this continuity",

    "jacobi ( hj ) equation .",
    "it is well - know that such equation separates if the background contains cyclic ( ignorable ) directions , but sometimes separation happens even between non  cyclic coordinates .",
    "the simplest example of such ` accidental separation ' comes from the three  dimensional flat space in spherical coordinates : the polar angle @xmath2 separates in the hj equation , although the metric depends on this coordinate . in this case",
    "the separation can be attributed to the su(2 ) symmetries of the sphere , but similar argument can not be applied to the kerr black hole , which has only u(1)@xmath3u(1 ) isometry , although the @xmath2 coordinate still separates .",
    "the technical aspects of this separation will be reviewed in section [ secseparkt ] , and here we just recall that the separation is associated with a hidden symmetry encoded in the killing tensor ( kt ) @xcite . the same tensor also leads to separation of the klein ",

    "killing(yano ) tensors encode all continuous symmetries of solutions in general relativity , but string theory also has discrete symmetries associated with dualities , which can be promoted to a continuous group of solution - generating transformations in supergravity .",

    "usually one uses the killing tensor to produce a conserved quantity which leads to separation of the hj and klein  gordon equations , and only one such quantity can be constructed from a given killing tensor . in section [ secseparkt ]",
    "we argue that if one looks further and studies the _ eigenvalues _ of the killing tensor , then a single kt can lead to a _ family _ of conserved quantities since the detailed analysis of eigenvalues allows one to construct a family of killing tensors from a single representative using an _ algebraic _ procedure ( i.e. , without solving differential equations ) . as a bi  product of this analysis",
    "we also demonstrate that separation caused by nontrivial killing tensors in any number of dimensions can only happen in ( degenerate ) ellipsoidal coordinates , this generalizes the earlier result of @xcite to non  supersymmetric geometries . in section [ seckytranks ]",

    "we begin with recalling that the killing vector ( kv ) is defined as a vector field @xmath4 which leaves the metric invariant . in other words , the lie derivative of the metric along @xmath4 must vanish : [ kvdefa ] l_v g_mn=0 , relation ( [ kvdefa ] )",
