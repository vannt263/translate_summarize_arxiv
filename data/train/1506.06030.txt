    "the generalized relaxation time approximation ( grta ) offers a simple and powerful way to interpolate between the collisionless and the collisional regimes of linear response functions .",
    "this theory has its roots in mermin s work on the density - density response function of the electron gas  @xcite , but it is applicable to a broader class of response functions and problems . the classic derivation is from the solution of the boltzmann equation with a collision integral that describes relaxation towards a local equilibrium distribution function .",
    "a local equilibrium distribution function ( ledf ) has the same form as the equilibrium distribution function ( a function of constants of the motion ) but is evaluated at the local values of the densities of the conserved quantities .",
    "thus , in the presence of impurity scattering , the ledf depends on a local chemical potential and a local temperature , determined by the local particle density and energy density respectively .",
    "momentum is not conserved , and therefore the ledf has zero average momentum .",
    "this is the situation considered in mermin s original paper . on the other hand ,",
    "if impurity scattering is absent or negligible on the time scale of particle - particle collisions , then the ledf depends also on a local drift velocity , determined by the local momentum density .",
    "regardless of whether electron - impurity collisions or electron - electron interactions dominate ( we assume that it is always either one or the other ) one can distinguish between ( i ) a collisionless regime in which the frequency of the macroscopic motion is much higher than the collision rate , and ( ii ) a collisional regime in which the frequency of the macroscopic motion is much lower than the collision rate .    when electron - impurity collisions dominate , the collisional regime is known as _ diffusive regime _ : there is a direct coupling between the current and the gradient of the density .",
    "similarly , when electron - electron collisions dominate , the collisional regime is known as _ hydrodynamic regime _ : there is a direct connection between the stress tensor and the gradient of the velocity field .    in the diffusive regime",
    "a drift velocity can only arise from the deviation of the distribution function from the ledf , whereas in the hydrodynamic regime a drift velocity is already present in the ledf .",
    "the diffusive regime is intrinsically limited to drift velocities that are small relative to the fermi velocity  it is basically a linear theory of drift . whereas the hydrodynamic regime is suitable to describe large drift velocities , which can not be treated in the linear approximation .",
    "let us formulate the general theory of the grta for a generic response function @xmath70 .",
    "we define the _ relaxation function _ @xmath71 as follows  @xcite : [ eq : grta_imp_chi_k_def ] ( q,)(q,0)since we will always be working at small @xmath35 ( @xmath72 ) , the @xmath35-dependence of @xmath73 will be ignored : @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath75 is ( minus ) the density of state of quasiparticles , and is thus renormalized by electron - electron interactions .",

    "let us now introduce the  high - frequency \" response function @xmath78 .",
    "the latter includes electron - electron interactions only to the extent of renormalizing the fermi liquid parameters .",

    "<S> we present extensive results for these transport coefficients in the case of the two - dimensional massless dirac fermion liquid in a doped graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> our approach relies on microscopic calculations of the viscosities up to second order in the strength of electron - electron interactions and in the high - frequency limit , where perturbation theory is applicable . </S>",
