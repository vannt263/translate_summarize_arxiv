    "the rapid burster ( mxb  1730@xmath1335 , or rb hereafter ; lewin et al .  1976 ) , discovered in 1976 , is a unique recurrent transient low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "it is located at a distance of approximately 8  kpc ( ortolani , bica , & barbuy 1996 ) in the highly reddened globular cluster liller  1 ( liller 1977 ) .",
    "the rb is the only known lmxb to produce both type  i and type  ii x - ray bursts ( hoffman , marshall , & lewin 1978a ) .",
    "although the rb has been studied for over twenty years , it is still not clear why the rb , and only the rb , emits both type  i and type  ii x - ray bursts .",
    "type  i bursts are due to a thermonuclear flash of accreted material on the surface of a neutron star , and are characterized by a distinct spectral softening during burst decay . of the @xmath0125 lmxbs",
    "known , at least 43 are type  i burst sources ( van paradijs 1995 ) .",
    "type  ii bursts are due to spasmodic accretion  the release of gravitational potential energy  presumably resulting from an accretion disk instability ; the spectrum of these bursts shows little evolution during the burst .",
    "the duration of type  ii bursts can range from 680 seconds ( the longest type  ii burst observed to date ) down to 4 seconds .",
    "the behavior of type  ii bursts is like that of a relaxation oscillator : the type  ii burst fluence @xmath2 is roughly proportional to the time interval , @xmath3 , to the following burst ( the ` @xmath2-@xmath3 ' relation :  lewin et al .  1976 ) . the type  ii burst luminosities at burst maximum range from @xmath04@xmath410@xmath5 to @xmath03@xmath410@xmath6  ( lewin , van paradijs & taam , 1993 ; henceforth lvt93 ) .",
    "gro  j1744@xmath128  is the only other lmxb known to emit repetitive type  ii bursts ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1996 ; lewin et al . 1996a ; kommers et al .",
    "lvt93 provide a comprehensive review of type  i and type  ii x - ray bursts and the rapid burster .",
    "the pattern of type  i and type  ii bursts , and the shape of the type  ii bursts themselves , have been observed to vary widely during a single outburst . at times , the rb emits only type  i bursts with strong persistent emission ( pe ) , behaving like a `` normal '' lmxb . at other times , type  ii bursts , occurring in a wide variety of forms and patterns , with or without substantial pe , are observed .",
    "when the rb is in a rapid bursting mode , it can emit thousands of rapid type  ii bursts per day , with little or no pe present .",
    "short type  ii bursts typically exhibit a timescale - invariant profile , with multiple peaks ( ` ringing ' ) during burst decay ( tawara et al .  1985 ) .",
    "bursts longer than about 35 seconds , on the other hand , are ` flat - topped ' in shape ( lewin et al .",

    "1987 )    quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) in the 28  hz frequency range are regularly seen in type  ii bursts from the rb , and occasionally in the pe ( tawara et al .",

    "1988a , b ; dotani et al .",
    "1990 ; lubin et al . 1991 ; rutledge et al . 1995 ) .",
    "qpo are also present in many rb type  ii bursts in the form of the ringing observed during burst decay ( lvt93 ) .",
    "qpo have not been observed in any type  i bursts from the rb .",
    "there are strong 0.04  hz qpo present in the pe after some long type  ii bursts ( lubin et al .",
    "1992b ) .",
    "the outbursts of the rapid burster have long been known to recur every 68 months , based on observed outbursts ( lvt93 ) .",
    "years at a time have passed without any positive detections ; however , monitoring of the source has historically been sporadic ( figure  [ fig : cov ] ) .",
    "this changed in february 1996 , when daily coverage of the rb ( for 11 months of the year ) began with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) all - sky monitor ( asm ) ( levine et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "since then , we have observed four complete outbursts with _",
    "rxte_. these outbursts have recurred at intervals of 200 , 217 , and 238 days .",
    "these outbursts show a nearly identical global evolutionary pattern : all four outbursts evolved , on the same timescale , from an initial phase dominated by type  i bursts to a type  ii burst - dominated phase .",
    "this evolutionary progression may provide some insight into the unique behavior of the rb .",
    "rutledge et al . (",
    "1998 ) have observed a radio source at 4.5/8.4 ghz whose strength is correlated with the x - ray emission from the rb as measured by the _ rxte _  asm .",
    "they have proposed that this radio emission comes from the rb , even though the @xmath01@xmath7 position of the radio source lies well outside the 2@xmath8 error circle for the rb obtained with _",

    "observations with the pca began on day 3 of the outburst , and type  i bursts were seen exclusively through day 14 . on february 16 , day 20 of the outburst , the rb was in a mode characterized by many rapid type  ii bursts , followed by a larger type ii burst .",
    "this mode is identical to the mode in which the rb was discovered ( lewin et al .",
    "rapid , regular type  ii bursting continued on february 19 , the final observation of the outburst .    we have performed a spectral analysis to determine the conversion from count rates to fluxes and to draw some rudimentary conclusions about the x - ray emitting regions .",
    "we emphasize that the model we present is probably not uniquely indicated by the data .",
    "no single - component models provided acceptable fits to the data ( minimum reduced chi - squared values , for 51 degrees of freedom , are  @xmath0 3 for type  i bursts , 10 for type  ii bursts , and 170 for the pe ) .",
    "two- and three - component models that we considered incorporated blackbody , disk blackbody , thermal bremsstrahlung , comptonization , and power law spectral components .",
    "the best fitting models combined a power law with two blackbody components , resulting in  = 0.81.4 .",
    "a simple two - component blackbody model , without a power law component , also provided statistically acceptable fits to most of the type  i bursts , but for many type  ii bursts and the pe this model was not acceptable (  = 6.8 in some cases ) .",
    "the addition of a power law component improved the fits in these cases .",
    "none of the other models that we investigated provided statistically acceptable fits to the data .",
    "best - fit temperatures of the two blackbody components were 1.11.5 kev and 0.250.40 kev , respectively . although the temperature of the hotter component in the type  i bursts varied from burst to burst , it cooled by @xmath00.2 kev over the course of the type  i burst in nearly every case ( see section  [ sec : i ] ) .",
    "the temperature of the cooler component remained relatively constant during type  i bursts .",
    "the luminosity of the hotter component was @xmath015 per cent that of the cooler component ( 2.520 kev ) , in the bursts and in the pe . when it was necessary to include a power law component in the model , the values for the photon index of the power law ranged from 1.94.0 , and luminosities ranged from 12 per cent of the cooler component ( 2.520 kev ) .",
    "most of the type  ii bursts and pe required a power law component in the spectral model to obtain an acceptable fit to the data .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density for our models was fixed at 2@xmath410@xmath15 @xmath16 , as determined from _ exosat _ observations ( tan et al .",
    "1991 ) ; we did not find the low - energy spectral response of the pca sufficient , in these observations , to constrain the column density independent of the other spectral parameters .",
    "one possible physical picture suggested by this model is of a system with three x - ray emitting regions : the neutron star surface ( @xmath01 kev blackbody ) , the accretion disk ( @xmath00.3 kev blackbody ) , and a comptonizing cloud of hot electrons ( responsible for the power law component , when present ) .",
    "the cooling of the hotter blackbody component during type  i bursts is consistent with a cooling neutron star surface ( lvt93 ) .",
    "in contrast , the roughly constant temperatures of the two blackbody components throughout the type  ii bursts suggest emitting regions that vary in size during the burst ( normalizations of both components vary with the x - ray flux ) .",
    "we derive blackbody radii for the hotter component during the type  i bursts of 9@xmath172 to 14@xmath172 @xmath18 km , depending on the burst , where @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19/8  kpc and @xmath19 is the distance to the rb . during type",
    "i bursts the cooler component has a blackbody emitting area of 0.7@xmath170.3 to 2.3@xmath171.0 @xmath410@xmath20 @xmath21 km@xmath22 .    for the type  ii bursts ,",
    "we derive blackbody radii at the peak of the bursts of 5.0@xmath171.0 to 10@xmath171.5 @xmath18 km , depending on the burst , for the hotter component , and blackbody emitting areas of 0.5@xmath170.3 to 2.1@xmath170.9 @xmath410@xmath20 @xmath21 km@xmath22 for the cooler component . the normalizations of both components vary with total x - ray flux during the bursts .    for the persistent emission spectra , we derive blackbody radii for the hotter component of 10@xmath172 to 13@xmath172 @xmath18 km and blackbody emitting areas of 0.9@xmath170.4 to 2.5@xmath170.8 @xmath410@xmath20 @xmath21 km@xmath22 for the cooler component .",
    "the normalizations of both components decrease over the course of the outburst as the total x - ray flux decreases .",
    "there are known problems with interpreting blackbody x - ray spectral fits in such a literal fashion ( lvt93 ) .",
    "one problem discussed in lvt93 is that the observed x - ray color temperature and the effective temperature ( that is , the temperature if the source were a true planckian emitter ) can differ by as much as a factor of @xmath01.5 . in the present case",
    ", this could lead to blackbody radii @xmath23 times larger than the values we have quoted .",
    "bursts were classified as type  i or type  ii , in part , by performing spectral fits on the `` excess '' ( pe - subtracted ) burst counts .",
    "this is not a perfectly straightforward procedure ( van paradijs & lewin 1985 ) ; however , while both type  i and type  ii bursts can show some spectral evolution during the burst , the spectral softening during the decay is much more pronounced in a type  i burst ( cf.figure  [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "the burst profile of a type  i burst , with a sharp rise and a roughly exponential decay , is also substantially different from that of a type ii burst ( except when the pe is near its peak level , when burst profiles alone are not sufficient to distinguish the two types ) .",
    "together with the spectral fits , then , the burst profiles were used to classify bursts as either type  i or type  ii .",
    "the bright lmxb 4u  1728@xmath134  lies only 0.5@xmath24 from the rb and is in the field of view of the pca when the rb is in the center of the field of view . to determine the contribution of this source , the satellite pointing was offset by 0.5@xmath24 away from 4u  1728@xmath134  for the last third of each observation .",
    "this procedure allowed us to estimate the number of counts arriving from each source , but reduced our count rate from the rb by about a factor of 2.5 for the offset phase of each observation . additionally , an occasional type  i burst from 4u  1728@xmath134was observed while the pca was pointed directly at the rb .",
    "these bursts were easily distinguished from rb bursts by their peak flux ( @xmath015,000 pca cts s@xmath9 ) and characteristic light curves , both of which differ markedly from bursts emitted by the rb .",
    "we also detected the well - known 363 hz oscillations ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ) from several of the 4u  1728@xmath134  type  i bursts .",
    "with the _ rxte _  asm we can detect the onset of a rb outburst to within less than one day .",
    "the four outbursts observed with _ rxte_began on 13 april 1996 , 30 october 1996 , 25 june 1997 , and 28 january 1998 .",
    "the intervals between the start of these outbursts are 200 , 238 , and 217 days , respectively . using these three values , we find the current average recurrence time for rb outbursts to be 218 days .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     using the 218 day average period determined from the asm data , we folded the record of rb observations with this value ( figure  [ fig : fold ] ) .",
    "the few outbursts that were observed from 19841989 seem to fit the pattern reasonably well , while those outbursts prior to 1984 do not fit .",
    "in fact , a good fit for the outbursts from 19761983 is obtained with a 181 day period .",
    "other periods , from 100300 days , were also used to fold the data , but none produced better agreement with the observed outbursts than the 181 and 218 day periods .",
    "although years have passed without any positive detections of the rb in outburst , figure  [ fig : fold ] indicates that very few of the observations during those years fell in the estimated outburst windows .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the rb goes into outburst at semi - regular intervals of 68 months",
    ". continued monitoring with the _ rxte _  asm will be essential to confirm and characterize this behavior .",
    "rb outbursts observed with other satellites have generally followed the evolution that we have described , with some exceptions . in all observations in which the rb was in phase",
    "i ( aug 83 , jun 97 , jan 98 ) , phase ii was observed several days later ( kunieda et al .",
    "there were two occasions , however , when phase ii may not have been preceded by phase i. from march 815 , 1978 , _ sas-3",

    "on august 8 , 1979 , rapid repetitive bursts were observed from the rb , indicating that it was in phase ii ( mode ii ) ( kunieda et al .",
    "if phase i occurred in these cases , it must have been extremely short - lived . in all other observations of the rb in outburst , there is a large enough gap ( two weeks ) between the last pre - outburst observation and the observation of phase ii for phase i to have occurred `` normally '' .",

    "when the rb was discovered in 1976 , mode i was observed , followed by mode ii .",
    "the rb then briefly returned to mode i before ending in mode ii ( lewin et al .",
    "1976 ; ulmer et al . 1977 , marshall et al .",
    "in april of 1977 , _",
    "ariel v _  and _ sas-3 _  saw the rb in mode ii , then mode i , and then finally mode ii again ( white et al .",

    "in addition , the duration of the sub - phases of phase ii can vary .",

    "observed mode 0 from august 816 ( kunieda et al .",
    "in 1984 , _ tenma _  observed mode 0 from july 25 , and mode i from july 69 ( tawara et al . 1985 ) .",
    "there are also many idiosyncrasies associated with phase ii . in september 1977 ,",
    "when the rb was in mode ii , a larger than normal type ii burst followed a type  i burst on four occasions ( hoffman et al .",
    "this led to the realization that the type  i bursts must have come from the rb .",
    "also , lubin et al . (",
    "1993 ) reported `` glitches '' that were observed following 10 of 84 long type  ii bursts observed with _",
    "exosat _  in august 1985 .",
    "in four rb outbursts observed with _ rxte _ we have noted a more or less consistent evolutionary pattern that is also reasonably consistent ( though not exclusively ) with previous observations of the rb .",
    "the outbursts begin suddenly and rise to their peak persistent emission ( pe ) level within three days .",
    "type  i bursts dominate for 1520 days , with a steadily declining level of pe ( phase i ) . by approximately day 18 of the outbursts , type  ii bursts appear ( phase ii ) .",
    "there are three main types of type  ii burst patterns : long , flat - topped bursts ; a series of short bursts followed by a large burst ; and rapid bursts at regular intervals . the rapid , regular bursts are the final phase of any outburst .    during the three outbursts in which phase ii was observed ,",
    "the phase did not begin until the pe luminosity had decreased to @xmath02@xmath410@xmath5 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "it seems likely that the pe level has important implications for the burst behavior of the rb .    in addition , the fact that type  i bursts observed during mode i occur preferentially during the period of enhanced pe has important implications for the mechanism that triggers type  i bursts .",
    "since the periods of enhanced pe always follow a large type  ii burst , it seems plausible that the thermonuclear flash is triggered by the extra amount of material that has been accreted onto the neutron star .    using the relation @xmath2=@xmath26 to relate the energy of a type  ii burst , @xmath2 , to the waiting time to the next burst , @xmath3",
    ", we find @xmath27 values in the range 0.430.94 for mode ii and the large type  ii bursts of mode i. the short type  ii bursts of mode i have a relatively constant burst separation , @xmath3 , of @xmath010 seconds , even though they vary in energy .",
    "the current average recurrence time for rb outbursts is @xmath0218 days .",
    "this agrees reasonably well with all observed outbursts after 1983 . for outbursts",
    "prior to 1984 , an average of @xmath0180 days seems more suitable .",
    "the possible reflares that might be present in two out of four outbursts observed with _ rxte",
    "_  are reminiscent of the echoes observed in some soft x - ray transients .",
    "this could be the result of an echo of the main outburst , in which either the companion star or the disk itself is heated by x - rays from the main outburst .",
    "the increased mass flow to the accretion disk that results from the heating of the companion star , or the excitation of the accretion disk if the disk itself is heated , could produce a response that we observe as a reflare of x - ray emission ( augusteijn , kuulkers , & shaham 1993 ; tanaka & lewin 1995 ) .",
    "the delay between the onset of the outburst and the echo , in this model , is related to the time required for matter to be transferred from the location in the disk where the disk instability occurs to the surface of the neutron star .",
