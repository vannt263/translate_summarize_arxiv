    "early - type galaxies are found in virtually all environments  from the field , to small groups , to rich clusters ( hubble & humason 1931 ; oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ) . in the highest density environments , ellipticals and lenticulars",
    "are known to dominate the overall fraction of bright galaxies , @xmath16 , with the precise contribution depending on local galaxy density and redshift ( smith  2004 ; postman   2005 ) . in the virgo cluster ,",
    "the rich cluster nearest to our own galaxy , @xmath17 for galaxies brighter than @xmath18 or @xmath19 ( julian et  al .",
    "1997 ) . mag ( tonry  2001 ; mei  2005b ) . ]",
    "if one considers not just giant galaxies , but also the much more common dwarfs , then the dominance of early - type galaxies is even more pronounced : i.e. , among the confirmed members of virgo with unambiguous morphological classifications , the early - type fraction is @xmath1 0.8 ( reaves 1983 ; binggeli , tammann & sandage 1987 , hereafter bts87 ) .",
    "it has long been recognized that early - type galaxies , both in virgo and elsewhere , often show compact nuclei near their centers . in their landmark study of the virgo cluster ,",
    "bts87 carried out a visual search for nuclei using wide - field , blue - sensitive photographic plates from the 2.5-m du pont telescope .",
    "of the 1277 members and 574 probable members in their virgo cluster catalog ( hereafter vcc ) , a total of 1192 were classified as non - nucleated dwarfs ( des or ds0s ) while an additional 415 dwarfs ( predominantly de , ns ) were found to be nucleated .",
    "thus , roughly 25% of the dwarf galaxies in virgo were found by bts87 to have a discernible nucleus , although the precise fraction was also found to depend on galaxy luminosity and position within the cluster ( see figure  8 of sandage , binggeli & tammann 1985 and figure  19 of bts87 , respectively ) .",
    "unfortunately , progress toward understanding the nature of these nuclei has been limited because of several factors : @xmath20 , ground - based studies must contend with the contamination from the underlying galaxy light , it is difficult to de - couple the brightness profiles of the nuclei from those of their host galaxies , and the nuclei are sufficiently compact that they appear unresolved in even the sharpest ground - based images ( caldwell 1983 , 1987 ; durrell 1997 ) .    while the photographic survey of bts87 remains a landmark study of nucleated galaxies in the local universe , there are reasons to believe that a modern survey of the nuclei belonging to early - type galaxies would be advisable  preferably one which capitalizes on the high angular resolution afforded by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . first , _ hst _",
    "imaging of late - type galaxies has revealed that 5070% of these systems have compact stellar clusters at or near their photocenters ( phillips et  al .",
    "1996 ; carollo , stiavelli & mack 1998 ; matthews et  al 1999 ; bker et  al . 2002",
    "; bker et  al .",
    "second , if the early - type members of the local group are any guide , then one may expect estimates for the fraction of nucleated galaxies to increase as better imaging becomes available .",
    "for instance , in recent years a number of local group dwarfs have been found to contain previously unrecognized central substructures and/or nuclei , including sagittarius ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ; monaco et  al . 2005 ) , ursa minor ( kleyna et  al . 2003 ; palma et  al .",
    "2003 ) , andromeda ii ( mcconnachie & irwin 2006 ) and fornax ( coleman et  al . 2004 ) .",
    "third , in their wfpc2 survey of dwarfs in the virgo and fornax clusters , lotz et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that six of the 30  non - nucleated \" dwarf ellipticals in their sample actually contained nuclei which had gone unnoticed in the ground - based surveys ( binggeli , tammann & sandage 1985 , hereafter bts85 ; bts87 ; ferguson 1989 ) .",
    "very recently , grant , kuipers & phillipps ( 2005 ) used imaging from the wide field camera on the isaac newton telescope to show that faint nuclei in virgo dwarfs were frequently missed in photographic surveys .",
    "these results suggest that there may be significant incompleteness in our census of nuclei in early - type galaxies .",
    "indeed , in their photographic study of virgo , bts87 cautioned that  most nuclei in the luminous e and s0 galaxies were probably missed due to [ the ] high surface brightness [ of the underlying galaxy . ] \" in addition to this surface - brightness selection effect , bts87 state explicitly that any nuclei with @xmath21 23 ( @xmath22 ) would fall below their plate detection limits and hence be missing from their catalog .",
    "the central regions of early - type galaxies have been favorite targets for _ hst _ since its launch in 1990 . for the most part",
    ", such surveys have tended to focus on the core structure of the galaxies .",
    "however , several studies reported the discovery of compact nuclei in ( predominantly bright ) samples of early - type galaxies , beginning with pre - refurbishment ( wfpc ) imaging ( crane  1993 ; lauer  1995 ) and continuing with imaging from wfpc2 ( rest  2001 ; lauer  2005 ) and nicmos ( ravindranath  2001 ) .",
    "these studies , which are primarily based on single - filter imaging of samples of ( 3377 ) galaxies with distances between 1 and 100  mpc , have confirmed that some early - type galaxies do contain compact nuclei , but there is disagreement over their overall frequency ( with estimates ranging from 13% to @xmath1 50% ) , whether or not they are resolved structures , and their classification as stellar or non - thermal ( agn ) sources .",
    "a better understanding of the physical properties of these nuclei is important since they almost certainly hold clues to the violent processes that have shaped the central regions of galaxies , which could include star formation triggered by infalling gas , collisions and mergers of stars and star clusters , tidal disruption of clusters and the growth of stellar  cusps \" by central black holes , and the mechanical and radiative feedback from accreting black holes or intense nuclear starbusts .",
    "this paper presents a homogenous analysis of the nuclei belonging to a sample of 100 early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "our images , taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; ford et  al .",
    "1998 ) , form the basis of the acs virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs ; ct  2004 ; hereafter paper  i ) . other papers in this series have discussed the data reduction pipeline ( jordn et al .",
    "2004a = paper ii ) , the connection between low - mass x - ray binaries in m87 ( jordn et al .",
    "2004b = paper iii ) , the measurement and calibration of surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes ( mei et  al .",

    "2006 = paper x ) and the discovery of diffuse star clusters in early - type galaxies ( peng et  al .",
    "2006b = paper xi ) .",
    "there are several features of the acs virgo cluster survey which make it uniquely suited to the study of nuclei in early - type galaxies .",
    "first , the survey itself targets a large sample of 100 early - type galaxies lying at a common distance of about 16.5  mpc so that the @xmath23 fwhm of the acs point - spread function ( psf ) corresponds to a small , and nearly constant , physical scale of @xmath24  pc .",
    "this excellent spatial resolution , coupled with the fine plate scale of 0049  pix@xmath25 , makes it possible to measure structural parameters for any nuclei larger than a few parsecs in size .",
    "second , with blue magnitudes in the range @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , our program galaxies span a wide range in luminosity so it is possible to study the phenomenon of nucleation in giant and dwarf galaxies simultaneously .",
    "third , the images are sufficiently deep that they reveal not only the nuclei , but also the many globular clusters belonging to our program galaxies ; thus , the same images which provide information on the nucleus and host galaxy can also be used to study the associated globular cluster systems and to explore possible evolutionary links between the clusters and nuclei . and",
    "finally , because multi - band imaging is available in two widely - separated bandpasses ( f475w and f850lp ) for each object in the survey , it is possible to use broadband colors to place rough constraints on the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of the nuclei and their host galaxies .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows .",
    " 2 gives a brief summary of the observational material used in our analysis .",
    "a description of the galaxy brightness profiles and the method of their analysis is presented in  3 .",
    " 4 contains a discussion of the empirical properties of the nuclei in our survey , such as their overall numbers , possible displacements from the galaxy photocenters , luminosities , colors , surface brightnesses and half - light radii . in  5 we discuss the implications of our findings for various formation scenarios .",
    "the article concludes with a summary of the main results in  6 . a future paper in this series will discuss the broader implications of our findings for models of nucleus formation in early - type galaxies ( merritt   2006 )",
    "our analysis is based on _ hst _ imaging for 100 early - type galaxies having morphological types e , s0 , de , de , n and ds0 . all are confirmed members of the virgo cluster based on radial velocity measurements .",
    "images were taken with the acs instrument used in wide field channel ( wfc ) mode with the f475w and f850lp filter combination , which are roughly equivalent to the @xmath28 and @xmath2 bands , respectively , in the sloan digital sky survey photometric system .",
    "these images form the basis of the acs virgo cluster survey , a complete description of which may be found in paper  i. note that the 26 brightest galaxies in this survey constitute a complete sample of early - type members of virgo with @xmath29 , and that the full sample represents 44% of all early - type members of virgo spanning the magnitude range @xmath30 .",
    "a customized data pipeline ( described in detail in paper ii ) produces geometrically - corrected , flux - calibrated , cosmic - ray - free images in the f475w and f850lp bandpasses .",
    "table  [ tab : data ] gives some basic information about the target galaxies , tabulated in order of increasing blue magnitude ( decreasing luminosity ) .",
    "an identification number for each galaxy is given in the first column , followed by the identification from the vcc ( bst85 ) and other names for the galaxy in the messier , ngc , ugc or ic catlogs .",
    "blue magnitudes , @xmath31 , from bst85 are presented in column 4 , while the fifth column records the adopted galactic reddening from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "columns 6 and 7 record the surface brightness of each galaxy , in both the @xmath28 and @xmath2 bandpasses , measured via spline interpolation at a geometric mean radius where @xmath32 is the semi - major axis and @xmath33 is the ellipticity . ] of @xmath34  1  ( @xmath1 80  pc ) .",
    "this model - independent choice of surface brightness should closely approximate the galaxy s _ central _ surface brightness , but is measured at a radius large enough to ensure negligible contamination from any central nucleus .",
    "the remaining columns of table  [ tab : data ] will be described below .",
    "coordinates , morphological classifications and other information on the program galaxies may be found in papers i and vi .",
    "our goals in this paper include the measurement of the structural and photometric properties of the nuclei in our program galaxies , and an investigation into the relationship between these nuclei and their host galaxies .",
    "additionally , we wish to compare the properties of the nuclei to those of the globular clusters in the program galaxies and , more generally , to the virgo ultra - compact dwarf ( ucd ) galaxies ( e.g. , drinkwater et  al .",
    "1999 ; hilker et  al .",
    "1999 ; drinkwater et  al .",
    "2000 ; phillipps et  al . 2001 ) identified in the course of this survey and described in haegan  ( 2005 ; hereafter paper  vii ) and haegan  ( 2006 ) . a companion paper in this series ( paper  vi ) presents an analysis of the surface brightness profiles of the program galaxies along with a tabulation of the best - fit structural parameters , while two other articles examine the photometric ( paper  ix ) and structural ( paper  x ) parameters of the globular clusters .",
    "as we make use of several results from these studies , the reader is referred to these papers for complete details .      because the nuclei are always superimposed on the light of the underlying galaxy , measuring their photometric and structural properties",
    "requires a model for the galaxy surface brightness profile . for each galaxy in our survey ,",
    "@xmath28- and @xmath2-band azimuthally - averaged radial surface brightness profiles are available from paper  vi .",
    "these profiles were derived by fitting the isophotes with the ellipse task in iraf which , in turn , is based on the algorithm of jedrzejewski ( 1987 ) .",
    "the @xmath28- and @xmath2-band brightness profiles were parameterized with a standard srsic ( 1968 ) model , @xmath35,$$ \\end{array } \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the central intensity and @xmath37 is a shape parameter which yields an @xmath38-law profile for @xmath39 ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) and an exponential profile for @xmath40 .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 is defined such that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the complete and incomplete gamma functions , respectively ( e.g. , graham & driver 2005 ) . as shown by caon , capaccioli & donofrio ( 1993 ) , a convenient approximation relating @xmath41 to the shape parameter @xmath37 is @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "given this definition of @xmath41 , @xmath47 is the effective radius of the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath28- and @xmath2-band brightness profiles for each galaxy were also fit with a `` core - srsic '' model , @xmath48^{\\gamma / \\alpha } \\exp \\biggl [ -b_n   \\biggl ( { r^{\\alpha } + r_b^{\\alpha } \\over r_e^{\\alpha } } \\biggr ) ^{1/(\\alpha n ) } \\biggr ] , \\end{array } \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 \\label{eq3 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] this model , which was first proposed by graham  ( 2003 ) , consists of a power - law component in the inner region of a galaxy , which `` breaks '' to a traditional srsic profile beyond some radius , @xmath50 .",
    "the model has a total of six free parameters : the logarithmic slope of the inner power - law ( @xmath51 ) ; the shape of the srsic function ( @xmath37 ) ; the break radius ( @xmath52 ) ; the effective half - light radius of the srsic profile ( @xmath47 ) ; the intensity at the break radius ( @xmath53 ) and a parameter ( @xmath54 ) which governs the sharpness of the transition between the inner power law and the outer srsic function .",
    "after some experimentation , it was decided to use the modified parametrization of trujillo  ( 2004 ) ,    @xmath55 @xmath56 \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] in which @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this model produced more stable fits , with better consistency between the five remaining parameters ( @xmath53 , @xmath51 , @xmath37 , @xmath47 and @xmath52 ) measured in the @xmath28 and @xmath2 bandpasses .",
    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) are intended to describe the profiles of galaxies which have no central nucleus .",
    "however , it is obvious that many galaxies in our sample do indeed have compact sources at or near their centers . for such nucleated galaxies , a single - component king model ( michie 1963 ; king 1966 )",
    "was used to represent this central component .",
    "this introduces three additional parameters to the fit : the total intensity of the nucleus ( @xmath59 ) ; the projected half - light radius ( @xmath60 ) ; and the king concentration index ( @xmath61 ) . in other words , for _ nucleated galaxies _ , the fitted model , @xmath62 , takes the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 is either a pure srsic model ( equation 1 ) or a core - srsic model ( equation 4 ) , depending on the galaxy in question , and @xmath65 is the central king model component . for non - nucleated galaxies ,",
    "the profiles are fit simply with models of the form of equations ( 1 ) or ( 4 ) .",
    "a detailed justification for the choice of galaxy model ( i.e. , srsic vs. core - srsic ) is given on a case - by - case basis in paper  vi .",
    "we adopt these classifications verbatim , with the exception of three intermediate - luminosity galaxies : vcc543 ( ugc7436 ) , vcc1528 ( ic3501 ) and vcc1695 ( ic3586 ) . for all nucleated ( type  ia ) core - srsic galaxies ; @xmath66 for the four galaxies in this category .",
    "] while the _ global _ brightness profiles of these galaxies are adequately represented by srsic models , such models overpredict the amount of galaxy light on subarcsecond scales . for the purposes of measuring photometric and structural properties for the nuclei in these galaxies , we parameterize the galaxy profiles with core - srsic models in all three cases .",
    "we note that the definition of a  nucleus \" invariably hinges on some assumption  explicit or otherwise  about the intrinsic brightness profile of the host galaxy .",
    "our study is no exception in this regard .",
    "choices for the galaxy profiles made by previous workers have included king models ( binggeli & cameron 1993 ) , pure exponentials ( binggeli & cameron 1993 ; stiavelli  2001 ) , nuker laws ( rest  2001 ; ravindranath  2001 ; lauer  2005 ) and sersic profiles ( durrell 1997 ; stiavelli  2001 ) .",
    "after considerable experimentation ( paper iv ) , we opted to use the family of models represented by equations  ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) because they have the great advantage they are flexible enough to provide accurate fits to the brightness profiles of both giant and dwarf galaxies ( see paper  vi ) .",
    "the use of a single ( srsic ) model to describe the full sample of galaxies also seems advisable in light of mounting evidence that , at least in terms of their _ structural parameters _ , the longstanding perception of a fundamental dichotomy between giant and dwarf ellipticals ( e.g. , kormendy 1985 ) may be incorrect ( see , e.g. , jerjen & binggeli 1997 ; graham & guzman 2003 ; paper  vi ) . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the choice of equations  ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) also seems reasonable given recent findings that the srsic law provides an accurate representation of the spatial and surface density profiles of dark matter halos in high - resolution @xmath67cdm simulations ( navarro et  al .",
    "2004 ; merritt et  al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "at the same time , our decision to parameterize the central nuclei with king models is motivated by high - resolution observations of the nuclei in nearby galaxies . in nucleated local group galaxies such as ngc205 and sagittarius ,",
    "king models are found to provide accurate representations of the central components ( e.g. , djorgovski  1992 ; butler & martnez - delgado 2005 ; monaco  2005 ) .",
    "nevertheless , for galaxies at the distance of the virgo cluster , we are working close to the limits of resolvability , so we caution that our choice of king models to parameterize the central components may not be unique , particularly for faint nuclei in the highest surface brightness galaxies .",
    "alternative parameterizations of the central brightness  cusps \" in our sample galaxies will be explored in a future paper in this series ( merritt  2006 ) .      as described in paper  ii , our analysis of the nuclei , brightness profiles , and isophotal structure of the galaxies",
    "is based on f475w and f850lp images in which a _ gaussian _",
    "kernel is used to distribute flux onto the output ( drizzled ) images .",
    "this choice of kernel has the advantage that , relative to _ lanczos3 _ kernel , bad pixels can be repaired more effectively , albeit with the penalty of a slight reduction in angular resolution . due to the compact nature of the nuclei ( even the most extended objects have effective radii @xmath68 ) , it is important that the effects of the psf are taken into account when fitting models to the observed brightness profiles .",
    "psfs in the f475w and f850lp filters , varying quadratically with ccd position , were derived using daophot ii as described in paper  ii .",
    "briefly , archival images of the galactic globular cluster ngc104 ( 47  tucanae ) taken during programs g0 - 9656 and go-9018 were used to construct empirical psfs in the two bandpasses .",
    "these archival images were drizzled in the same manner as the images for the program galaxies .",
    "a total of @xmath1  200 stars in each filter were used to construct the psfs , which extend to a radius of 05 in both bandpasses .",
    "to follow the behavior of the psfs to still larger radii , we matched our empirical psfs at a radius of 03 to those measured for high - s / n composite stars by sirianni  ( 2005 ) .",
    "these latter psfs extend to radii of 3 , and were constructed from images of 47  tuc fields taken as part of the photometric calibration of acs .",
    "figure  [ fig01 ] shows azimuthally averaged psfs for the f475w and f850lp filters measured at the position of the nucleus in vcc1303 ( ngc4483 )  the program galaxy whose center is nearest to the mean position for the full sample of program galaxies .    a @xmath69 minimization scheme was used to find the models which best fit the azimuthally - averaged , one - dimensional intensity profiles for each galaxy .",
    "minimizations were carried out using the minuit package in the cern program library ; initial determinations of the minima , obtained using a simplex minimization algorithm ( nelder & mead 1965 ) , were later refined using a variable metric method with inexact line search ( migrad ) .",
    "following byun et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , all points in the profile were assigned equal weight .",
    "for both nucleated and non - nucleated galaxies , the psfs at the location of the galaxy s center were convolved with the models before fitting to the intensity profiles .",
    "customized psfs were created for each galaxy in the survey , centered at the exact ( sub - pixel ) location of the nucleus . while , in practice , the psf convolution has little impact on the fitted srsic or core - srsic model parameters , with the exception of @xmath51 , this step is critically important when evaluating accurate structural parameters for the central nucleus .",
    "profile fits are carried out independently in the two bandpasses , with the exception of the 11 nucleated galaxies brighter than @xmath70 ( i.e. , type  ia galaxies ; see  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "our numerical experiments suggest that in this high surface brightness regime , the profile of the underlying galaxy makes the measurement of nuclei half - light radii and total magnitudes extremely challenging ( see appendix  a ) . for these galaxies ,",
    "the composite @xmath28- and @xmath2-band profiles were first fitted simultaneously and the individual fits constrained so that the galaxy shape index parameter , nucleus concentration index and half - light radius were the same in the two bandpasses . when dust is present ( see below ) , the models are fitted to the dust - corrected surface brightness profiles if @xmath71 50% of the points along a given isophote are affected ; otherwise the dust affected regions are masked .",
    "more details on the correction for dust obscuration are given in paper  vi .",
    "sufficiently compact nuclei will appear unresolved even in our acs images . to estimate the resolution limit of our observations",
    ", we constructed brightness profiles for a number of likely stars which appear in our images .",
    "these candidate stars were classified as unresolved in the object catalogs produced by kingphot , the reduction package used to measure structural and photometric parameters for the globular clusters in these fields ( see papers ii and x ) .",
    "fitting king models to the brightness profiles of these objects gives median half - light radii of 0011@xmath720004 and 0018@xmath720005 in the f475w and f850lp bandpasses , respectively . as an additional test , we may make use of the fact that vcc1316 ( m87 = ngc4486 ) , one of the agn galaxies in our survey ( see below ) , contains a prominent non - thermal central point source .",
    "although this source is saturated in our f475w images , a king model fitted to the central source in the @xmath2-band brightness profile gives @xmath73 . in what follows ,",
    "we adopt a conservative upper limit of 0025 @xmath1 2  pc for the resolution limit in both bandpasses .    before proceeding ,",
    "we pause to demonstrate that the vast majority of the nuclei belonging to our program galaxies are indeed more extended than point sources . in figure",
    "[ fig02 ] , we show @xmath28-band surface brightness profiles for a representative sample of nine nucleated galaxies , chosen to span the full range in fitted half - light radius ( with @xmath74 decreasing from left to right and from top to bottom ) . in each panel ,",
    "the red curves show the results of fitting the nuclear component with a king model , while the blue curves show the results of fitting a central point source ; residuals from both fits are shown in the lower panel . with the exception of vcc1528 ( ic3501 ) , the central nucleus is resolved for all of the galaxies in figure  [ fig02 ] . in total , six galaxies in our sample  vcc1883 ( ngc4612 ) , vcc140 ( ic3065 ) , vcc1528 , vcc1695 ( ic3586 ) , vcc1895 ( ugc7854 ) and vcc1826 ( ic3633 )  have best - fit half - light radii , measured in at least one bandpasses , that fall below our nominal resolution limit of 0025 .",
    "these half - light radii are given in parantheses in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "they have been included in the following analysis , but we caution that they are formally unresolved in our acs images .",
    "we shall return to the issue of these compact nuclei in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "additional tests on the resolution limits , possible biases in the derived photometric and structural parameters , and a discussion of measurement errors , are given in  4.1 and appendix  a.",
    "as many as eighteen of the 100 galaxies in table  [ tab : data ] show evidence for dust  either as isolated patches and filaments , or in the form of disks having varying degrees of regularity ( see paper  vi ) . for the most part",
    ", this dust has no impact on the identification of possible nuclei .",
    "however , for four galaxies in our sample ( i.e. , vcc1535 = ngc4526 , vcc1030 = ngc4435 , vcc685 = ngc4350 and vcc571 ) the central dust obscuration is severe enough to make a reliable classification of these galaxies as nucleated or non - nucleated impossible .",
    "moreover , for vcc1535 and vcc1030 , both of which harbour massive , kpc - scale dust disks , the surface brightness profiles are themselves so limited that it is not even possible to place the galaxies in the appropriate srsic or core - srsic categories .    in general , the census of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in intrinsically faint galaxies",
    " and in the acs virgo cluster survey galaxies in particular  is far from complete .",
    "however , two of the brighter galaxies in our sample ( vcc1316 = ngc4486 , m87 , 3c 274 and vcc763 = ngc4374 , m84 , 3c 272.1 ) are known to host agns with strongly non - thermal spectral energy distributions ( e.g. , wrobel 1991 ; ho 1999 ; chiaberge , capetti & celotti 1999 ) . in both cases , the unresolved non - thermal nucleus is clearly seen in the acs images ; in neither instance , however , does there appear to be a resolved stellar nucleus . a third galaxy ( vcc1619 = ngc4550 ) , is classified as a liner by ho  ( 1997 ) .",
    "this galaxy contains some dust within the central @xmath75 25 , but there is clear evidence for a resolved stellar nucleus .",
    "wrobel ( 1991 ) detected nuclear radio emission in three other galaxies in our survey ( vcc1226 = ngc4472 , m49 ; vcc1632 = ngc4552 , m89 ; and vcc1978 = ngc4649 , m60 ) . in both vcc1226 and vcc1632 , the innermost @xmath75 1",
    "are slightly obscured by dust ( see paper vi ) , but once a correction for dust obscuration is performed , there is no evidence of a stellar nucleus in either case .",
    "we see no sign of a nucleus in vcc1978 .",
    "a search for low - level agn in our program galaxies is now underway using low- to intermediate - resolution ground - based optical spectra , the results of which will be presented in a future paper in this series .",
    "these spectroscopic data will be useful in establishing the extent to which non - thermal sources are responsible for , or contribute to , the central luminosity excesses observed in a number of these galaxies . for the time being , table  [ tab : class ] summarizes our classifications for the program galaxies , as discussed in the next section .",
    "we begin by defining a class of galaxies ( type 0 ) in which dust obscuration ( four galaxies ) or agn emission ( two galaxies ) renders a reliable classification as nucleated or non - nucleated impossible . in what follows",
    ", we shall limit our analysis to the remaining 94 galaxies .      as a first step in the identification of nuclei in our program galaxies ,",
    "the @xmath28- and @xmath2-band surface brightness profiles were each fitted with the appropriate galaxy model ( i.e. , either a pure srsic or core - srsic model ) outside a geometric mean radius of 05 . those galaxies with brightness profiles which lay systematically above the inward extrapolation of fitted model for @xmath76 were considered to be nucleated . because many of the nuclei are somewhat bluer than the underlying galaxies , a central excess was often more apparent in the @xmath28-band profile than in the redder bandpass .",
    "in addition to classifying the galaxies on the basis of their brightness profiles , the f475w and f850lp images for each galaxy were carefully inspected for the presence of a distinct central excess .",
    "using these two criteria , a total of 62 galaxies were found to show clear evidence for a central nucleus ; such galaxies are classified as type ia or ib .    unfortunately , for 11 of these 62 galaxies , although the presence of a faint central component could be established from the images themselves or from the brightness profiles , the nucleus itself was too faint to allow us to recover trustworthy photometric or structural parameters from the surface brightness profiles .",
    "such galaxies are referred to as type ib in tables  [ tab : data ] and [ tab : class ] .",
    "our analysis of the structural and photometric properties of the nuclei is therefore based on the subset of 51 nucleated galaxies for which it was possible to obtain a reliable fit to the central brightness profiles : i.e. , type  ia galaxies .",
    "the type  ib galaxies are classified as nucleated for the purposes of computing the overall frequency of nucleation , but their nuclei are omitted from the analysis in  4.4 to 4.8 .",
    "of the remaining 9462 = 32 galaxies , five may have nuclei which are offset by @xmath77 or more from the centers of the isophotes ( type  ie galaxies ) .",
    "we consider these five galaxies in more detail in  4.3 .",
    "the remaining 94625 = 27 objects consist of galaxies which are either unquestionably non - nucleated , or galaxies with uncertain classifications .",
    "as described in appendix  a , we have carried out a series of experiments in which simulated nuclei having sizes and luminosities that obey the empirical scaling relations found in  [",
    "sec : results ] , are added to  and removed from  the observed brightness profiles . by re - fitting the brightness profiles obtained in this way",
    ", we aim to refine the nuclear classifications of these galaxies .",
    "to summarize our conclusions from these simulations , we classify 12 of these 27 galaxies as _ certainly non - nucleated _ ( type  ii ) , 11 as _ possibly nucleated _ ( type  i d ) and four others as _ likely nucleated _ ( type  ic ) .",
    "these classifications are reported on a case - by - case basis in table  [ tab : data ] , and summarized for the entire sample in table  [ tab : class ] .",
    "figure  [ fig03 ] shows f475w images for the central 10@xmath7810  regions ( @xmath1 800@xmath78800  pc ) of all 100 galaxies in the survey . each galaxy is labelled according to the classifications from table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "azimuthally - averaged surface brightness profiles in the @xmath28-band for all 100 galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig04 ] .",
    "for the 51 type ia galaxies shown in this figure , the dashed and dotted curves indicate the best - fit models for the nucleus and galaxy , while the combined profile is shown by the solid curve . for all remaining galaxies ,",
    "the solid curve simply shows the best - fit srsic or core - srsic model .",

    "open symbols in figure  [ fig04 ] denote datapoints that were omitted when fitting the galaxy profile ( e.g. , the innermost datapoints for galaxies which contain nuclei too faint to be fit reliably , outer datapoints for the close companions of luminous giant galaxies , and , occasionally , datapoints corresponding to pronounced rings , shells , or other morphological peculiarities ) .",
    "given that independent fits of the @xmath28- and @xmath2-band brightness profiles are performed for the type  ia galaxies , it is natural to ask how well the photometric and structural parameters of the nuclei measured in the two bands agree .",

    "note that for 11 of these 51 galaxies ( i.e. , those objects with @xmath81 ) , the king concentration index and half - light radii of the nuclei were constrained to be the same in the two bandpasses ; these nuclei are plotted as open stars in the first panel of figure  [ fig05 ] .",
    "in addition , we include in this figure the five galaxies with possible offset nuclei , bearing in mind that in these cases , the @xmath60 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 measurements were carried out in a rather different way ( see  4.3 for details ) .",
    "the open circles show the nuclei of these five galaxies .",
    "the third panel of figure  [ fig05 ] compares two estimates for the color of the nuclei : i.e. , that obtained by integrating the best - fit @xmath28- and @xmath2-band king models , @xmath82 , and an aperture color , @xmath83 , obtained using a circular aperture of radius 4 pixels ( 020 @xmath1 16  pc ) applied to the nucleus of the galaxy - subtracted image .",
    "the mean difference between the total and aperture colors is 0.018  mag , in the sense that the aperture colors are slightly redder .",
    "the @xmath84 scatter in the measured radii and colors is found to be @xmath85 0007 and @xmath86 0.059  mag , respectively . assuming the latter uncertainty arises equally from errors in the @xmath28 and @xmath2 bands , we find @xmath87 0.041  mag for the nuclei magnitudes .",
    "we adopt these values for the typical uncertainties on the fitted radii , colors and magnitudes , bearing in mind that additional systematic errors ( e.g. , in the photometric zeropoints or in the construction of the psfs ) may affect the measurements . in any case",
    ", we conclude from figure  [ fig05 ] that there is excellent internal agreement between the measured sizes , colors and magnitudes .",
    "vcc classifications for our program galaxies are given in table  [ tab : data ] where column ( 8) reports the classification from bst85 : y means nucleated , n means non - nucleated .",
    "our new classifications are given in column ( 9 ) .",
    "column 10 indicates which type of model was used to represent the galaxy :  s \" = srsic or ",
    "cs \" = core - srsic .",
    "the most basic property of the nuclei which might serve as a constraint on theories for their origin is the overall frequency , @xmath88 , with which they are found in our program galaxies . among the 94 galaxies which can be reliably classified as either nucleated or non - nucleated",
    ", we find 62 galaxies , or @xmath89% of the sample to show clear evidence for a central nucleus ( types  ia and ib ) .",
    "however , we believe this estimate should be considered a firm lower limit on the frequency . including the type  ic galaxies ( which are very likely to be nucleated but could not be classified as such unambiguously ) , gives @xmath90% .",
    "if one also includes the type  i d galaxies , which _ may _ be nucleated , one then finds @xmath91% .",
    "finally , if all five galaxies with possible offset nuclei are included ( although we caution in  4.3 that the weight of evidence argues against doing so ) , the percentage of nucleated galaxies could be as high as @xmath92% .",
    "while the true frequency probably lies between these extremes , it is nevertheless striking to think that , among our sample of 94 classifiable galaxies , in only 12 cases can the _ absence _ of a nucleus be established with any degree of certainty .      among",
    "the 100 elliptical , lenticular and dwarf galaxies in the acs virgo cluster survey , 24 dwarf galaxies ( de , ns ) and one e galaxy were classified as nucleated in the original vcc ( bst85 ; see also table  [ tab : data ] of paper  i ) .",
    "the frequency of nucleation which we derive here , @xmath93 6687% , is much higher than the value of @xmath94 found using the classifications of bst85 , and represents a sharp upward revision of the nucleation frequency for early - type galaxies in this luminosity range .",
    "there are several reasons why such a discrepancy should come as no surprise .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , ours is the first systematic census of nuclei in early - type galaxies that includes both dwarf and giant galaxies ( spanning a factor of @xmath75 460 in blue luminosity ) .",
    "more importantly , the studies of bst85 and bts87 , along with most of the major subsequent studies of dwarf galaxies and their nuclei ( e.g. , binggeli & cameron 1991 ; 1993 ) , were based on visual inspection of photographic plates . as pointed out in  1 and stressed by bst85 themselves ,",
    "the vcc classifications are known to be incomplete fainter than @xmath21 23 ( @xmath22 ) and to suffer from surface brightness selection effects for the luminous e and s0 galaxies .",
    "clearly , selection effects of this sort are less of an issue for our survey , where the identification of the nuclei is relatively straightforward thanks to the depth and high spatial resolution of the acs images .",
    "in any case , care must be taken when comparing our measurement to previous estimates since the frequency of nucleation is known to depend on the luminosities of the galaxies under consideration ( e.g. , sandage , binggeli & tammann 1985 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig06 ] shows the luminosity functions for our sample of 62 nucleated galaxies ( types  ia and ib ) as the double - hatched histogram ; the hatched histogram shows this same sample plus the 15 likely or possibly nucleated galaxies of types ic and i d ( i.e. , 77 galaxies in total ) .",
    "for comparison , the 25 galaxies classified as nucleated by bst85 are shown by the filled histogram , and the open histogram shows the distribution of the 94 classifiable galaxies from the acs virgo cluster survey . as expected , the disagreement between our classifications and that of bst85 is quite dramatic for galaxies brighter than @xmath95 .",
    "this happens to be the approximate dividing point between dwarf and giant galaxies in the vcc , which strongly suggests that the disagreement is the result of selection effects that made it difficult or impossible for bst85 to identify nuclei in bright , high - surface - brightness galaxies . for @xmath96 ,",
    "there is better agreement although we still find significantly more nuclei even among these faint galaxies : i.e. , we classify 46 of 53 galaxies , or @xmath97 , of this subsample as nucleated , compared to just 25/56 ( @xmath1 47% ) using the bst85 classifications .",
    "the luminosity dependence of @xmath88 is shown explicitly in the lower panel of figure  [ fig06 ] .",
    "a vivid demonstration of the importance of surface brightness selection effects when classifying nuclei is shown in figures  [ fig07 ] and [ fig08 ] .",
    "the first of these figures compares the distribution of galaxy surface brightnesses , measured at a geometric mean radius of 1 , for the same four samples shown in the figure  [ fig06 ] .",
    "by contrast , figure  [ fig08 ] shows nucleus magnitude as a function of galaxy surface brightness measured at a geometric mean radius of 1 .",
    "filled symbols show the 51 type  ia galaxies in our sample , while the open squares show the 25 galaxies classified as nucleated by bst85 .",
    "open circles in this figure denote the five galaxies with possible offset nuclei .",
    "figures  [ fig07 ] and [ fig08 ] leave little doubt that the survey of bst85 preferentially missed nuclei in the bright , high - surface - brightness galaxies .",
    "we further note that a recent survey of 156 virgo dwarfs with the wide field camera on the isaac newton telescope uncovered faint nuclei in 50 galaxies previously classified as non - nucleated , consistent with our upward revision for frequency of nucleation ( grant , kuipers & phillipps 2005 ) .",
    "of course , it is conceivable we _ too _ may be missing faint nuclei in the highest surface brightness galaxies ; it is certainly true that the 11 galaxies for which we are unable to measure reliable photometric or structural parameters for the nuclei are among the highest surface brightness galaxies in our survey .",
    "accordingly , we stress once again that the estimate of @xmath98% from  4.1 , which is based on galaxies with unambiguous nuclei , _ is certainly a lower limit to the true frequency of nucleation among our sample of early - type galaxies_. we shall return to this point in  5.2 ( see also appendix  a ) .    figures  [ fig09 ] and [ fig10 ] illustrate the importance of _ hst _ imaging for the identification of nuclei in these galaxies . in figure  [ fig09 ]",
    "we show a comparison between the co - added f475w image for vcc2048 ( ic3773 )  a type  ia galaxy  with three simulated ground - based images for this same galaxy . in these three cases ,",
    "the co - added f475w frame has been binned @xmath99 and convolved with gaussians having dispersions of 1 , 2 and 3 pixels , corresponding to fwhm of 05 , 09 and 14 .",
    "it is clear that seeing effects alone make the detection of faint , compact nuclei challenging under normal conditions of ground - based seeing .",
    "this finding is all the more sobering when one considers that vcc2048 , classified as ds0(9 ) in the vcc , was thought on the basis of the original bst85 classifications to be the brightest non - nucleated dwarf galaxy in our sample .",
    "the first two panels of figure  [ fig10 ] compare the f475w image for vcc784 ( ngc4379 ) with a @xmath100-band image taken with the 2.4 m hiltner mdm telescope on 21 april , 1993 in conditions of 114 seeing . this galaxy , one of the brightest type ia galaxies in our survey , was also classified as non - nucleated in the study of bst85 . as the third panel of figure  [ fig10 ] demonstrates",
    ", there is no hint of a central nucleus in the ground - based surface brightness profile , despite the fact that the nucleus , which is clearly visible in the acs brightness profile , is among the brightest and largest in our sample .",
    "as noted in  1 , a few _ hst _ studies had previously revealed the presence of compact nuclei in bright early - type galaxies ( e.g. , rest  2001 ; ravindranath  2001 ; lauer  2005 ) . while these programs preferentially focussed on distant , high - luminosity ellipticals and lenticulars  with 80% of the galaxies in these respective surveys having absolute magnitudes brighter than @xmath101 and @xmath102 , compared to @xmath103 for the present survey  there is nevertheless some overlap with our sample at the bright end due to the large number of luminous e and s0 galaxies in the virgo cluster . in this section",
    ", we compare our nuclear classifications with those reported in these previous surveys , limiting the comparison to those galaxies in our survey which have unambiguous classifications ( i.e. , types  ia , ib and ii ) . for completeness",
    ", we also compare our classifications for three faint galaxies to those of lotz  ( 2004 ) who carried out a wfpc2 snapshot survey of early - type dwarf galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "table  [ tab : comp ] summarizes the nuclear classifications for galaxies in common with the surveys of rest  ( 2001 ) , ravindranath  ( 2001 ) , lauer  ( 2005 ) and lotz  ( 2004 ) .",
    "the rest  ( 2001 ) study presented wfpc2 ( f702w @xmath104 ) imaging for 67 early - type galaxies between 6 and 54 mpc , with a mean distance of @xmath1059 mpc . to minimize spurious detections , rest  ( 2001 ) adopted rather conservative criteria in their search for nuclei , identifying nucleated galaxies as those objects which showed a central excess , along both the major and minor axes , over the best - fit  nuker \" model inside a radius of 015 .",
    "based on these criteria , they identified nuclei in 9 of their 67 galaxies ( 13% ) .",
    "no structural and photometric parameters were measured for the nuclei .",
    "there are six galaxies in common between their survey and ours .",
    "we find reasonable agreement between the two studies , with the exception of vcc731 ( ngc4365 ) : rest  ( 2001 ) report no nucleus in this galaxy , whereas we find a small , but definite , central brightness excess .",
    "accordingly , we classify this galaxy as type  ib ( i.e. , certainly nucleated ) .    the nicmos study of ravindranath  ( 2001 )",
    "was carried out using f160w ( @xmath106 ) images from the nic2 ( fwhm = 017 , scale = 0076 ) and nic3 ( fwhm = 022 , scale = 02 ) cameras . for 33 galaxies with distances in the range 7 to 69  mpc and @xmath10714  mpc",
    ", these authors fitted two - dimensional , psf - convolved  nuker \" models to their nicmos images . compact sources  consisting of narrow , psf - convolved gaussians  were then included for those galaxies whose one - dimensional surface brightness profiles showed evidence for a central excess ( 14 of their 33 galaxies ) .",
    "fwhms and magnitudes for the nuclei were then obtained by @xmath69 minimization .",
    "we find good agreement with the ravindranath  ( 2001 ) classifications .",
    "specifically , we confirm the absence of nuclei in vcc1226 and vcc881 ( m86 = ngc4406 ) . for vcc763 ( m84 = ngc4374 ) , which is classified as nucleated by these authors , we confirm the presence of a central point source , although the galaxy is classified as type  0 in table  [ tab : data ] due to the presence of strong agn activity .",
    "all of the nuclei in the study of ravindranath  ( 2001 ) were found to be unresolved point sources , although this is probably a consequence of the relatively poor resolution of their images : i.e. , at the mean distance of their sample galaxies , the nicmos fwhm corresponds to @xmath75 20  pc .",
    "the wfpc2 study of lauer  ( 2005 ) was based on f555w or f606w ( @xmath108 ) imaging for 77 galaxies ; a little more than half of their galaxies ( 45 ) were also imaged in the f814w ( @xmath109 ) bandpass .",
    "the galaxies have distances in the range 10 to 97  mpc , with mean @xmath110 , so the 007 fwhm for the pc1 ccd corresponds to a physical scale of 11  pc for the typical galaxy .",
    "magnitudes and colors for the nuclei in their sample  identified as an excess above the  nuker \" model which best fits the observed brightness profile  were derived by direct integration of the model residuals . in only two of their 25 nucleated galaxies",
    "did the nucleus appear resolved .",
    "there are seven acsvcs galaxies having unambiguous nuclear classifications which are in common with lauer  ( 2005 ) .",
    "the classifications are in agreement in three cases : vcc1978 , vcc731 and vcc1903 ( m59 = ngc4621 ) . for vcc1146 ( ngc4458 ) , which lauer  ( 2005 )",
    "classify as non - nucleated , we believe the discrepancy may be due to the highly extended nature of the nucleus . with @xmath111 08 = 62  pc ,",
    "it is largest nucleus in our sample , and would be difficult to distinguish from the underlying galaxy profile in brightness profiles of limited radial extent ; the lauer  ( 2005 ) brightness profile for this galaxy covers just the inner 5 .",
    "the three remaining galaxies  vcc1226 , vcc881 and vcc1632  are listed as nucleated in lauer  ( 2005 ) , but we classify each of these galaxies as type  ii ( non - nucleated ) . we speculate that the detection of nuclei in vcc1226 and vcc1632 is an artifact resulting from the presence of dust in both galaxies , which partly obscures the innermost @xmath75 1 .",
    "lauer  ( 2005 ) do not correct their images for dust obscuration ; once such a correction is performed , we find no indication of a central nucleus in either galaxy ( see also paper  vi ) .",
    "in the case of vcc881 , which is classified as nucleated by lauer  ( 2005 ) , a faint continuum enhancement is indeed detected in both the @xmath28 and @xmath2 bands at the central location .",
    "this feature would certainly be enhanced by the deconvolution procedure applied by lauer  ( 2005 ) to their data .",
    "however , it is unclear whether this corresponds to a stellar nucleus .",
    "if one assumes that vcc881 follows the scaling relation between nucleus and galaxy luminosity obeyed by the rest of the sample , then the putative nucleus would be underluminous by a factor of @xmath75 250 .",
    "furthermore , starting around 04 , the surface brightness profile of vcc881 _ decreases _ towards the center ( carollo  1997 ) .",
    "the origin of this central surface brightness depression is unclear ( lauer  2002 ; paper  vi ) : e.g. , an intrinsic decrease in the luminosity ( or mass ) density , or perhaps obscuration by gray dust , might be responsible . since either processes could produce a modest and localized continuum enhancement such as the one seen at the nuclear location , we believe this galaxy is best classifed as non - nucleated ( type  ii ) .",
    "we further note that there is no evidence of nuclear activity in vcc881 from its optical , radio and x - ray properties ( ho  1997 ; rangarajan  1995 ; fabbiano  1989 ) .",
    "lotz  ( 2004 ) carried out wfpc2 ( f555w @xmath108 and f814w @xmath109 ) imaging for 69 des and de , ns , mostly belonging to the virgo and fornax clusters . in their analysis ,",
    "a nucleus was identified as a bright compact object within 15 of the galaxy photocenter .",
    "while the lotz  ( 2004 ) survey tended to focus on fainter galaxies than does our survey ( i.e. , their program galaxies have absolute blue magnitudes in the range @xmath112 mag , with mean @xmath113  mag ) , there are three galaxies which appear in both studies : vcc9 ( ic3019 ) , vcc543 and vcc1948 . in the case of vcc9 and vcc1948 , the two studies agree in finding no evidence of a nucleus at the position of the galaxy photocenter .",
    "however , we have identified both of these galaxies as possible examples of galaxies with offset nuclei ( see  [ sec : offset ] ) .",
    "although lotz  ( 2004 ) do not comment on a possible offset nucleus in the case of vcc1948 , they state that : ",
    "vcc9 was originally classified as nucleated by binggeli  ( 1985 ) , but its brightest globular cluster candidate is 18 from its center \" . for comparison , we measure an offset of 191@xmath72007 for this object and , like lotz  ( 2004 ) , conclude that it is probably a star cluster projected close to the galaxy photocenter , rather than a _ bonafide _ nucleus .",
    "the remaining galaxy , vcc543 , appears in the list of non - nucleated galaxies in table  3 of lotz  ( 2004 ) , although we find unmistakable evidence for a nucleus in this object ( see figures  [ fig03 ] and [ fig04 ] ) that is offset by no more than 007@xmath72012 from the galaxy photocenter .",
    "finally , we note that two recent papers ( de propris  2005 ; strader  2006 ) have examined the properties of nuclei belonging to subsets of the galaxies from the acs virgo cluster survey , based on the same observational material used in this paper .",
    "a detailed comparison of the sizes , magnitudes and colors we measure for the nuclei with those reported by de propris  ( 2005 ) and strader  ( 2006 ) is given in appendix  b.      before proceeding , we pause to consider those galaxies that may have offset nuclei .",
    "nuclei displaced from the photocenters of their host galaxies are potentially interesting since they may hold clues to the general processes which trigger and/or regulate the formation of nuclei in general . for instance , offsets may arise through the ongoing merging of globular clusters through dynamical friction ( tremaine , ostriker & spitzer 1975 ; miller & smith 1992 ) , the fading of stellar populations in dwarf irregular or blue compact dwarf galaxies as they evolve into dwarf ellipticals ( e.g. , davies & phillips 1988 ) , recoil events following the ejection of a supermassive black hole from the nucleus ( merritt  2004 ) or counter - streaming instabilities that develop in flat and/or non - rotating systems ( zang & hohl 1978 ; de rijcke & debattista 2004 ) .    from an observational perspective , the identification of such nuclei is a complicated problem .",
    "they are prone to confusion with globular clusters , foreground stars or background galaxies  difficulties that are particularly serious in ground - based imaging , where the nuclei and contaminants will appear unresolved .",
    "the most ambitious study of offset nuclei undertaken to date is that of binggeli , barazza & jerjen ( 2000 ) , who measured offsets for a sample of 78 nucleated dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster using digitized images of blue photographic plates obtained in conditions of fwhm @xmath1 12 seeing .",
    "they found offset nuclei to be commonplace , with @xmath114 in 45 ( 58% ) and @xmath115   in 14 of the objects ( 18% ) .",
    "it is of interest to check these results given the small sizes of the measured offsets relative to the ground - based seeing disk , the absence of color information that might be used to identify contaminants , and the possibility of confusion with galactic stars , globular clusters and , to a lesser extent , background galaxies .",
    "we have used our acs images to measure offsets for the nuclei of the 62 type  ia and ib galaxies in our sample . in both the f475w and f850lp images for each galaxy ,",
    "we first calculate the centroid of the nucleus and its corresponding uncertainty .",
    "the location of the galaxy photocenter is then found by averaging the centers of ellipses fitted to the galaxy isophotes over the range 1  @xmath116 ( paper  vi ) . the uncertainty on the position of the photocenter is taken to be the standard deviation about the mean ellipse center .",
    "adding in quadrature the uncertainties for the position of the nucleus and photocenter then yields the uncertainties for the offset .",
    "the results reported in column 17 of table  [ tab : data ] are averages of the offsets measured from the f475w and f850lp images .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] shows the measured offsets for the 62 galaxies .",
    "offsets are shown both in arcseconds ( upper panel ) and in units of the effective radius of the galaxy , @xmath117 , taken from paper  vi ( lower panel ) . in only three galaxies",
    "do we see evidence for an offset as large as 1 . using a less restrictive criterion of @xmath118 05 , we find only five galaxies that may have offset nuclei ( i.e. , type  ie galaxies ) .",
    "these galaxies , which are shown as the open circles in figure  [ fig11 ] , are :    * _ vcc9_. this very low surface brightness galaxy has multiple bright sources near its photocenter ; it may be a dirr / de transition object and seems to contain a rich population of  diffuse star clusters \" ( paper  xi ) .",
    "in addition to the presumed nucleus , there is a second source about two magnitudes fainter which is located @xmath1 15 from the photocenter ( and a similar distance from the presumed nucleus ) .",
    "both the color and the half - light radius of the presumed nucleus are similar to those of metal - poor globular clusters in our dwarf galaxies .",

    "it is the brightest of several sources in the inner few arcseconds .",
    "there also appears to be a very faint surface brightness  excess \" that is nearly coincident with the galaxy photocenter .",
    "it is therefore possible that this galaxy may be a normal ( type ib ) nucleated galaxy , albeit one with an unusually faint nucleus .",
    "if so , then the source identified as the possible nucleus may be a globular cluster .",
    "we conclude that in every case there is considerable uncertainty regarding the nature of the presumed offset nucleus .",
    "it is possible  and we consider it likely  that the  offset nuclei \" in all five of these galaxies are merely globular clusters residing in non- or weakly - nucleated galaxies .    are there nuclei with even smaller offsets ?",
    "the nuclei of four other galaxies ( vcc1539 , vcc2019 , vcc1895 and vcc1695 ) have offsets @xmath123 and , in fractional terms , there are four other galaxies that have nuclei offset by more than 1% of the galaxy effective radius ( vcc2019 , vcc1199 , vcc1695 and vcc1895 ) .",
    "we remind the reader , however , that these offsets correspond to just two acs / wfc pixels , and should be confirmed using deeper , higher resolution imaging .",
    "our only secure conclusion is that , _ at most _ , only five of the nucleated galaxies in our survey , or @xmath1 7% of the sample , have nuclei that are offset by more than 05  from their photocenters  at least three times smaller than the value of @xmath75  20% found by binggeli  ( 2001 ) .",
    "moreover , we believe that most  and perhaps _ all _  of the  nuclei \" in the type  ie galaxies are probably globular clusters , so this should be considered a firm upper limit on the percentage of galaxies with nuclei offset by more than 05 . the actual percentage may in fact be zero .",
    "a key result to emerge from the survey of bts87 was the discovery of a spatial segregration between nucleated and non - nucleated dwarf galaxies in virgo : the de , ns are more strongly concentrated to the cluster center than the des ( see , e.g. , figure  9 of bts87 ) .",
    "a similar trend was later reported for the fornax cluster by ferguson & sandage ( 1989 ) .",
    "our discovery of nuclei in many of the galaxies classified as non - nucleated by bst85 suggests that it is worth reconsidering this important issue .    to facilitate comparison with the bts87 and bst85 results , we limit our analysis in this section to those galaxies fainter than @xmath96 , the approximate dividing point between dwarfs and giants in the vcc .",
    "as it happens , this magnitude also divides the acs virgo cluster survey equally into two samples of 50 galaxies .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig12 ]",
    ", the heavy solid curve shows the cumulative distribution of projected distances from the center of the virgo cluster for the 50 galaxies with @xmath124(j2000 ) = 12:30:49.4 and @xmath125(j2000 ) = 12:23:28 . ] using the vcc classifications , one finds this sample to be composed predominantly of dwarfs ( i.e. , 33 of 50 galaxies according to table  1 of paper  i ) .",
    "the dotted and dashed curves show the corresponding distributions for the nucleated ( 23 ) and non - nucleated ( 27 ) galaxies in this sample , once again using the vcc classifications .",
    "a ks test confirms the visual impression from this figure that the nucleated galaxies in our survey exhibit the same trend noted by bts87 for the full sample of nucleated dwarfs in the vcc : i.e. , the de , n galaxies are more centrally concentrated than their non - nucleated counterparts .    in the right panel of this figure",
    ", we show the sample of 49 galaxies with @xmath96 which we are able to classify as nucleated or non - nucleated from our acs images ( heavy solid curve ) . excluding for the moment the five galaxies with possible offset nuclei , whose true nature is uncertain , we find 40 of 44 remaining galaxies to be nucleated ( dotted curve ) .",
    "given the preponderance of nucleated galaxies , it is not surprising to see that a systematic difference in central concentration between the two populations is no longer apparent . of course , with just four non - nucleated galaxies in this regime , the sample falls below the minimum size needed for statistically reliable results using a ks test , but our point in showing this comparison is to stress again that the overwhelming majority of program galaxies with @xmath126 contain nuclei .",
    "a definitive investigation into the spatial distribution of nucleated and non - nucleated galaxies in the virgo cluster would require acs imaging for many hundreds of galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , we can speculate on the origin of the trend noted by bts87 .",
    "it has long been known that galaxies in virgo show some segregation in terms of luminosity and morphology .",
    "ichikawa et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) noted that the dwarf elliptical galaxies in the central regions of virgo appear to be larger and brighter than those in the cluster outskirts . at the same time , bts87 showed that the bright early - type galaxies ( e+s0 ) are less strongly concentrated to the cluster center than the faint ( de ) early - type galaxies ( see their figures  7 and 8) .",
    "since central surface brightness is proportional to total luminosity for early - type galaxies , the bts87 finding implies that bright , high - surface - brightness dwarfs ( hsbds ) in virgo are more spatially extended than low - surface - brightness dwarfs ( lsbds ) . because the original bts87 classifications suffer from a serious surface brightness selection effect",
    " in the sense that nuclei belonging to galaxies with central surface brightnesses @xmath127  mag  arcsec@xmath128 will go undetected ; see figure  [ fig08 ]  the observed trend may simply be a consequence of this surface brightness selection effect .",
    "to put this claim on a more quantitative footing , we have calculated the density profiles for hsbd and lsbd early - type galaxies in virgo , using a surface brightness of @xmath129  mag  arcsec@xmath128 as a dividing point between the two subgroups . as shown in figure  [ fig08 ]",
    ", bts87 would have tended to classify lsbds as nucleated , while the hsbds would have been preferentially classified as non - nucleated .",
    "a least - squares fit to our sample galaxies gives @xmath130 , so that @xmath127  mag  arcsec@xmath128 corresponds to a total galaxy magnitude of @xmath131 .",
    "restricting ourselves to the early - type members of virgo with @xmath132 , this leaves us with a total of 448 galaxies .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath133 represents the approximate transition between dwarfs and giants in virgo , while the lower limit reflects the completeness limit of the bts87 survey . among this sample of 448 galaxies ,",
    "there are 42 hsbds with @xmath134 , and 406 lsbds with @xmath135 .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] shows the density profiles , @xmath136 , for these two populations . in calculating the profiles ,",
    "we have excluded galaxies belonging to the m and w clouds , and discarded galaxies with declinations less than 9@xmath137 to guard against contamination from the virgo b subgroup centered on vcc1226 ( m49 ) .",
    "fitting exponentials of the form @xmath138 gives scalelengths of @xmath139 and @xmath140  deg@xmath25 for the lsbd and hsbd populations , respectively .",
    "in other words , there is a statistically significant tendency for the hsbd early - type galaxies  the same galaxies which would preferentially be misclassified as non - nucleated in the vcc because of their high central surface brightnesses  to be more spatially extended .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation that the differing spatial distributions for de and de , n galaxies noted by bts87 is , in fact , a consequence of their survey s surface brightness limit .",
    "lotz  ( 2004 ) and grant , kuipers & phillipps ( 2005 ) found that brighter galaxies tend to contain brighter nuclei .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig14 ] plot the magnitudes of the nuclei against those of the host galaxies ; results for the @xmath28 and @xmath2 bandpasses are shown in the left and right panels , respectively . filled and open symbols show the results for 51 type  ia and five type  ie galaxies .",
    "the dashed lines in these panels show the least - squares lines of best fit : @xmath141 and @xmath142 . for comparison ,",
    "the solid lines show the best - fit relations , with ( fixed ) unity slope : @xmath143    the lower panels of figure  [ fig14 ] show these same data in a slightly different form . in these panels , we plot the ratio of nucleus luminosity , @xmath144 , to host galaxy luminosity , @xmath145 , @xmath146 as a function of galaxy magnitude .",
    "total luminosities for the nuclei were obtained by integrating the brightness profiles of the best - fit king model components ( see  3 ) .",
    "these magnitudes are recorded in columns ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) of table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "galaxy luminosities are taken from paper  vi , in which the best - fit galaxy model  either srsic or core - srsic , as specified in column ( 10 ) of table  [ tab : data ]  was integrated over all radii to obtain the total luminosity .",
    "the contribution of the nucleus itself was excluded in the calculation of  @xmath145 .",
    "the primary conclusion to be drawn from figure  [ fig14 ] is that the nucleus - to - galaxy luminosity ratio does not vary with galaxy luminosity , although there is considerable scatter about the mean value . in terms of @xmath147 , the relations in equation  6 are equivalent to @xmath148 for the two bands , where the quoted uncertainties refer to the mean errors .",
    "our best estimate for the mean nucleus - to - galaxy luminosity ratio is then @xmath149 this is well below previous estimates : only 5 of the 51 nucleated galaxies in figure  9 of binggeli , barazza & jerjen ( 2000 ) have nuclei with fractional luminosities smaller than this . while the discrepancy may partly be the result of different choices for the models used to parameterize the galaxy brightness profiles ( e.g. , binggeli et  al .",
    "2000 use king models for the galaxy when calculating the luminosity of the central excess ) , it is also true that the greater depth and sensitivity of the acs imaging allows us to identify fainter nuclei than is possible from the ground , while the high spatial resolution allows a more accurate subtraction of the underlying galaxy light .",
    "the luminosity function of nuclei is one of the most powerful observational constraints on models for their formation .",
    "for instance , one theory involves the growth of a central nucleus through mergers of globular clusters whose orbits have decayed because of dynamical friction ( tremaine , ostriker & spitzer 1975 ; tremaine 1976 ; lotz  2001 ) . while this scenario is consistent with the well known fact that the brightest nuclei have luminosities that exceed those of the brightest globular clusters ( e.g. , durrell et  al .",
    "1996 ; durrell 1997 ) , a reliable measurement for the luminosity function of the nuclei has been hard to come by due to the lack of high - resolution ccd imaging for large , homogenous samples of early - type galaxies .",
    "the need for _ hst _ imaging in this instance is clear , since subtle differences in the subtraction of the galaxy light ( particularly the choice of model to represent the galaxy ) can lead to large differences in the inferred luminosities of the nuclei ( see , e.g. , section 5 of binggeli & cameron 1991 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig15 ] , we plot the luminosity functions , in @xmath28 and @xmath2 , for the sample of 51 type  ia nuclei given in table  [ tab : data ] . a gaussian distribution , @xmath150 provides an adequate representation of the luminosity functions , although there is no physical justification for this particular choice of fitting function ( and it is likely that the luminosity function suffers from some degree of incompleteness at both the bright and faint ends ) .",
    "moreover , if the mean luminosity of nuclei in early - type galaxies is indeed a roughly constant fraction , @xmath151 , of that of their host (  [ sec : lum ] ) , then the distribution shown in figure  [ fig14 ] may largely be a reflection of the luminosities of the program galaxies .",
    "with these caveats in mind , we overlay the best - fitting gaussian distributions in figure  [ fig15 ] as the dotted curves .",
    "fitted parameters and their uncertainties are recorded in table  [ tab : lf ] .    a core objective of the acs virgo cluster survey is a study of the globular cluster populations associated with early - type galaxies .",
    "since many thousands of virgo globular cluster candidates have been identified in the course of the survey ( e.g. , papers ix , x and xi ) , it is possible to compare directly the luminosity functions of the nuclei with those of the globular clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig15 ] shows the @xmath28- and @xmath2-band luminosity functions for @xmath1 11,000 high - probability globular cluster candidates from the survey .",
    "these objects were chosen to have globular cluster probability indices , @xmath152 , in the range @xmath153 ( see jordn  2006 for details ) .",
    "a complete discussion of the globular cluster luminosity function is beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented in a future article . for the time being , we simply note that , brighter than the 90% completeness limits of @xmath154  mag and @xmath155  mag , the luminosity functions of the globular clusters in virgo ( which are dominated by the contributions from the brightest galaxies ) are well described by gaussian distributions with @xmath156  mag and reddening - corrected turnover magnitudes of @xmath157  mag and @xmath158  mag .",
    "these gaussians are shown as the upper dotted curves in each panel of figure  [ fig15 ] .",
    "it is apparent that the luminosity function of the nuclei extends to higher luminosities than that of the globular clusters and that , irrespective of the functional form used to parameterize the luminosity function of the nuclei , their distribution is significantly broader than that of the globular clusters .",
    "in addition , their distribution is displaced to higher luminosities than that of the globular clusters .",
    "we measure this offset to be @xmath159  mag and @xmath160  mag in the two bands .",
    "thus , on average , the nuclei are @xmath75 25 times brighter than a typical globular cluster .",
    "we shall return to this point in  5.2 .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig15 ] are seven probable ucd galaxies in the virgo cluster , drawn from paper  vii and from haegan  ( 2006 ) .",
    "these objects were identified on the basis of magnitude and half - light radius from the same images used to study the nuclei and globular clusters .",
    "although the ucd sample is limited in size , membership in virgo has been established for each object through radial velocity measurements , surface brightness fluctuation distances , or both .",
    "furthermore , the mass - to - light ratios presented in paper vii demonstrate that at least some of these objects appear genuinely distinct from globular clusters .",
    "several explanations for their origin have been proposed ; according to what is probably the leading formation scenario , they are the surviving nuclei of dwarf galaxies which have been extensively stripped by gravitational tidal fields in the host cluster ( e.g. , bassino  1994 ; bekki  2001 ) . the ucds shown in figure  [ fig15 ] have luminosities which coincide with the peak of the nuclei luminosity function , which is certainly consistent with this  threshing \" scenario .",
    "however , it is important to bear in mind that the luminosities of the ucds shown in figure  [ fig15 ] are entirely due to the construction of the sample : i.e. , candidates from paper  vii and haegan  ( 2006 ) were _ selected _ to have @xmath161  mag and @xmath162  mag .      prior to the launch of _ hst _",
    ", virtually nothing was known about the sizes of the nuclei in dwarf galaxies .",
    "a notable exception was the compact , low - luminosity nucleus of the local group dwarf elliptical galaxy ngc205 , which was measured to have @xmath163  04 = 1.4  pc by djorgovski et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) . this early estimate , which was based on deconvolved ground - based images , is in good agreement with more recent values obtained using acs surface brightness profiles ( e.g. , merritt  2006 ) .",
    "however , measuring half - light radii for nuclei at the distance of virgo using ground - based images is impossible ( e.g. , caldwell 1983 ; sandage , binggeli & tammann 1985 ; caldwell & bothun 1987 ) .",
    "for instance , using high - resolution cfht images for ten virgo dwarfs , durrell ( 1997 ) was only able to place an upper limit of @xmath164 0405 ( 3040  pc ) on the sizes of the nuclei .",
    "even with the excellent angular resolution and spatial sampling afforded by _ hst_/acs , the measurement of structural parameters for the nuclei is challenging  more so than for a typical virgo globular cluster because the nuclei are observed on a bright background which is varying rapidly in both the radial and azimuthal spatial directions . in their wfpc2 snapshot survey of dwarf galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters ,",
    "stiavelli  ( 2001 ) and lotz  et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) did not attempt to measure half - light radii for the nuclei , but they noted that these nuclei have  sizes \" less than 013 ( 10  pc ) . working from the same wfpc2 data for a subset of five nucleated dwarfs , geha , guhathakurta & van der marel ( 2002 ) derived half - light radii in the range 914  pc ( 011018 ) .    with their greater depth and superior sampling of the instrumental psf ,",
    "our acs images are better suited to the measurement of half - light radii than any previous dataset , including the wfpc2 imaging .",
    "moreover , images are available in two filters , so it is also possible to carry out independent size measurements and identify possible systematic errors arising from uncertainties in the f475w and f850lp psfs .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig05 ] , we have made such a comparison and find good agreement between the half - light radii measured in the different bandpasses , with a typical _ random _ measurement error of @xmath165 0007 .",
    "we note that half - light radii measured for the nuclei of approximately two dozen of our program galaxies have recently been reported by de propris  ( 2005 ) and strader  ( 2006 ) .",

    "clearly , the nuclei have a size distribution that is different from that of the globular clusters .",
    "in the latter case , the distribution is sharply peaked , with a typical ( and nearly constant ; paper  x ) half - light radius of @xmath169  pc ( i.e. , @xmath75 30% larger than the resolution limit for the nuclei ) .",

    "there is , however , considerable overlap between the two distributions , and the most compact nuclei have half - light radii that are indistinguishable from those of globular clusters .",
    "the ucds , on the other hand , have half - light radii which resemble those of the nuclei . as with the luminosity functions",

    "the solid lines in the two panels show the relations : @xmath171 this luminosity dependence constitutes another clear point of distinction between nuclei and globular clusters : the latter , both in the milky way ( van den bergh et  al .",

    "it is interesting to see that the ucds  which in figure  [ fig16 ] were found to have half - light radii comparable to those of the largest nuclei  are outliers in this size - luminosity plane .",
    "compared to nuclei of comparable luminosity , the ucds are nearly three times larger , with @xmath111 0205 .",
    "alternatively , one might consider the ucds to be @xmath75  2  mag underluminous for their size . in any event",

    "we have calculated the average surface brightness within the half - light radius for the four fornax ucds which have absolute magnitudes and half - light radii reported in their table  2 . in doing so",
    ", we have transformed their @xmath100-band magnitudes into the @xmath28 and @xmath2 bandpasses using assumed colors of @xmath180 and @xmath181 , which are appropriate for old , intermediate - metallicity populations ( see table  3 of paper  iii ) .",

    "( 2005 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the five candidate offset nuclei are observed to fall along the diagonal swath defined by the globular clusters in figure  [ fig18 ] .",
    "this strengthens the conclusion from  4.3 that these objects are globular clusters , rather than _ bonafide _ nuclei .",
    "the first comprehensive investigation into the colors of nuclei in dwarf galaxies was the series of papers by caldwell ( 1983 ; 1987 ) and caldwell & bothun ( 1987 ) .",
    "based on imaging of 30 dwarfs in the fornax cluster , caldwell & bothun ( 1987 ) found no evidence for a color difference between the nuclei and their host galaxies .",
    "they did , however , find a correlation between nuclei luminosity and galaxy color , in the sense that the reddest galaxies tended to harbor the brightest nuclei . at a given luminosity",
    "the nucleated galaxies were also found to be slightly redder than their non - nucleated counterparts .",
    "a decade later , high - resolution cfht imaging for two virgo dwarfs ( durrell 1997 ) hinted at an apparent diversity in nuclei colors : in one galaxy ( vcc1254 ) , the nucleus was found to be significantly bluer than the galaxy , while in the case ( vcc1386 ) , the colors were indistinguishable .",
    "recently , lotz et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) have carried out aperture photometry for the nuclei of 45 de , n galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters using @xmath183 images from three wfpc2 snapshot programs .",
    "they find that : ( 1 ) the nuclei are consistently bluer than the underlying galaxy light , with offset @xmath184(@xmath185 ) = 0.10.15  mag ; ( 2 ) the nuclei colors correlate with galaxy colors and luminosities , in the sense that the redder nuclei are found in the redder and brighter galaxies ; ( 3 ) and the nuclei are slightly redder than the globular clusters associated with the host galaxy .",
    "our examination of the nuclei colors begins with figure  [ fig19 ] .",
    "the left panel of this figure shows the color - magnitude diagram for the nuclei of the 51 type  ia galaxies ( filled circles ) and the five galaxies with possible offset nuclei ( open circles ) . for the type  ia galaxies , the symbol size is proportional to the blue luminosity of the host galaxy . for reference ,",
    "11 galaxies with nuclei redder than @xmath186 have been labeled .",
    "note that one other galaxy , vcc21 , has a very blue nucleus with @xmath187 .",
    "although it is listed in table  [ tab : data ] as a possible example of a galaxy with an offset nucleus , we have argued in  4.3 ,  4.6 and  4.7 that such offset  nuclei \" are likely to be misclassified star clusters .",
    "in the case of vcc21 , the blue color of the object points to a young age ( i.e. , @xmath188  gyr for virtually any choice of metallicity ; see figure  6 of paper  i ) .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the galaxy s dirr / de transitional morphology .",
    "there are a number of noteworthy features in the color - magnitude diagram shown in figure  [ fig19 ] .",
    "first , both the colors and luminosities of the nuclei are seen to correlate with host galaxy luminosity , in the sense that the nuclei belonging to the most luminous galaxies are the brightest and reddest objects in our sample .",
    "this finding is consistent with the trend noted by lotz et  al .",
    "even more striking , though , is the tendency for _ the nuclei themselves to follow a clear color - luminosity relation_. to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time such a trend has been detected .",
    "the dashed line in figure  [ fig19 ] shows the relation @xmath189 obtained from a least - squares fit to the 37 nuclei belonging to galaxies with @xmath190 .",
    "while this relation provides an excellent description of the color - magnitude relation for the nuclei in faint galaxies , it appears to break down for brighter galaxies : in this regime , the nuclei not only show considerable scatter , but they lie systematically to the faint / red side of the extrapolated relation .",
    "these red nuclei cause the histogram of nuclei colors to have secondary peak at @xmath191 1.5 ( see the right panel of figure  [ fig19 ] ) .",
    "they are found exclusively in high - surface - brightness environments , which raises the possibility of a bias in the measured colors .",
    "however , the simulations described in appendix  a  in which artificial nuclei of known size , magnitude and color are added to the non - nucleated galaxy vcc1833 and their properties measured in the same way as the actual nuclei  show no evidence for a significant color bias for such bright nuclei .",
    "in addition , the colors for most of these nuclei are actually redder than the galaxies themselves , by @xmath75  0.1  mag , so it seems unlikely that contamination from the host galaxy can entirely explain their red colors .    for comparison , the open stars in figure  [ fig19 ] show the sample of virgo ucds from paper  vii and haegan  ( 2006 ) .",
    "the agreement with the nuclei is striking : i.e. , with a mean color of @xmath192 = 1.03@xmath720.06  mag , the ucds have colors that are virtually identical to those of comparably bright nuclei .",

    "the relationship between nuclei color and magnitude , figure  [ fig20 ] divides the sample by host galaxy magnitude into four subgroups .",
    "these subsamples are shown in the four separate panels , with the color - magnitude relation given by equation ( 13 ) repeated in each case ( the dashed line ) .",
    "also included in each panel are the globular clusters ( small points ) belonging to the galaxies in each of these magnitude intervals ; to reduce contamination from stars and compact galaxies , we plot only those sources with ",

    "note the clear bimodality in the colors of globular clusters belonging to these galaxies ( paper  ix ) . with the exception of the very red nuclei noted above",
    ", we conclude that the nuclei in our type  ia galaxies have colors which fall within the range spanned by the bulk of the globular clusters in these same galaxies : @xmath193  mag . comparing the globular cluster colors to those of the ucds from figure  [ fig19 ]",
    ", we see that the ucds are @xmath1 0.10.2 mag redder than the population of blue globular clusters , but @xmath1 0.20.3 mag bluer than the red clusters .",
    "this may be a point of distinction with the ucds in fornax , which mieske  ( 2006 ) find to have colors similar to the red globular clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig21 ] shows how the colors of the galaxies , nuclei and globular clusters depend on the galaxy luminosity .",
    "results are shown for the @xmath28 and @xmath2 bands in the left and right panels , respectively . a common distance of 16.5",
    "mpc has been assumed for all galaxies ( mei  2005 ) .",
    "galaxy colors are taken from paper  vi and represent the average color in the range 1  @xmath116 , subject to the acs / wfc field view and excluding those regions with surface brightnesses 1 mag  arcsec@xmath128 or more below the sky .",
    "the majority of our galaxies show no evidence for strong color gradients , so these colors should accurately reflect their integrated colors . for the globular clusters , we plots colors for the red and blue subpopulations , as determined in paper  ix , along with that of the composite cluster system . to highlight the subtle trends exhibited by these various samples , we show mean colors for the nuclei , globular clusters and galaxies in four broad bins of approximately equal width in galaxy magnitude ( @xmath75  2  mag ) .",
    "results for the nuclei are shown for three bins containing an equal number of objects .",
    "this figure reveals a correlation between nucleus color and galaxy luminosity that is broadly consistent with the finding of lotz ( 2004 ) for fainter galaxies .",
    "however , the trend is relatively weak and is in fact due mainly to the @xmath75 one dozen galaxies noted above that have very red nuclei .",
    "these galaxies make up most of the objects in the bins at @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 , @xmath197 . in the fainter galaxies ,",
    "the nuclei colors show essentially no correlation with galaxy luminosity . for galaxies fainter than @xmath198 , the nuclei have @xmath199 ",
    "intermediate in color to the globular clusters and stars in galaxies in this luminosity regime .",
    "in the preceding sections we have focussed on the observed properties of the nuclei found in our program galaxies .",
    "we now turn to the broader question of what these observations may be telling us about the origin and evolution of galactic nuclei . before doing so",
    ", we pause to briefly review some of the scenarios that have been proposed as possible explanations for stellar nuclei in early - type galaxies .",
    "a more complete discussion of the theoretical implications of our findings will be given in merritt  ( 2006 ) .",
    "tremaine , ostriker & spitzer ( 1975 ) were the first to suggest that galactic nuclei may be the remains of merged globular clusters , which were driven inward to the galactic center by dynamical friction ( chandrasekhar 1943 ) . according to this",
    " merger model \" , the metallicity and luminosity of the nucleus should be a superposition of the metallicity and luminosity of the progenitor clusters . because dynamical friction causes the orbits of most massive globular clusters to decay most rapidly , a nucleated galaxy would be expect to show a selective depletion of _ bright _ globular clusters , at least in the inner regions where the dynamical friction timescale is short compared to a hubble time .",
    "the contribution of globular clusters mergers to the growth of central black holes and galactic nuclei has been explored in a series of papers by capuzzo - dolcetta and coworkers ( e.g. , capuzzo - dolcetta 1993 ; capuzzo - dolcetta & tesseri 1999 ) .",
    "recently , bekki  ( 2004 ) have used numerical simulations to examine the physical properties ( e.g. , half - light radii , central velocity dispersion , mean density ) of nuclei that form in such mergers .    motivated by the discovery that the de galaxies in virgo are less centrally concentrated than the de , n galaxies ( c.f . ",
    "4.4 ) , oh & lin ( 2000 ) revisited the question of how the tidal field from the virgo cluster affects the evolution of globular cluster orbits within de galaxies . they found that tidal perturbations acting on galaxies near the center of the cluster tend to be compressive , and have little net effect on the rate of decay of the globular cluster orbits . in the outer regions of the virgo cluster , tidal forces tend to disrupt galaxies , and",
    "the resulting decrease in density leads to longer time scales for dynamical friction .",
    "thus , tidal forces favor the formation of nuclei in galaxies which are located in the cluster core , and suppress the formation in more distant galaxies .",
    "clearly , this will cause the relative number of nucleated and non - nucleated galaxies to vary within the cluster , with the highest fraction of nucleated galaxies in the core .",
    "a second , broad category of models focuses on a dissipational origin for the nuclei . noting that galaxies with nuclei are typically rounder than those without , van den bergh ( 1986 )",
    "speculated that nuclei form from the gas which collects more easily in the centers of slowly - rotating galaxies .",
    "silk , wyse & shields ( 1987 ) argued that dwarf galaxies experience late accretion of cool gas from the intergalactic medium , leading to star formation and the growth of compact central nuclei . in a similar vein ,",
    "davies & phillips ( 1988 ) proposed that early - type dwarfs result from the fading of stellar populations in dwarf irregular or blue compact dwarf galaxies . in this scenario ,",
    "intermittent bursts of central star formation  driven by the infalling gas  continue until the gas reservoir is depleted . according to this scenario , the final star - forming event gives rise to the nucleation observed today .",
    "babul & rees ( 1992 ) examined the impact of the local intergalactic medium on the evolution of a low - mass galaxy .",
    "they argued that the pressure of the intergalactic medium acts as a confining agent : in a high - pressure environment , early - type dwarfs are able to retain more gas and produce a nucleus from the gas that has been prevented from escaping by the intergalactic medium . since the external pressure acting on galaxies decreases with increasing distance from the cluster center , some properties of the nuclei ( such as their luminosity and color ) should also depend on position within the cluster , with the highest frequency of nucleation in the central regions of a cluster .",
    "gas inflow models have also been explored within the context of disk galaxy mergers .",
    "mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) used n - body / hydrodynamical simulations to show that such mergers are accompanied by gas dissipation and central star formation which may result in the formation of a dense stellar core , or the fueling of a pre - existing agn . following weedman ( 1983 ) , mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) further note that the dense stellar core may itself collapse to form a supermassive black hole ( sbh ) .",
    "the observational evidence for a possible link between such sbhs and the stellar nuclei of early - type galaxies is examined in  [ sec : bh ] .",
    "high - resolution _ hst _ imaging for sa - sd galaxies has shown that these objects frequently contain compact nuclear clusters near their photocenters ( e.g. phillips et  al .",
    "1996 ; carollo , stiavelli & mack 1998 ; matthews et  al 1999 ; bker et  al . 2002",

    "figure  [ fig22 ] compares the sample of nuclear clusters from bker  ( 2004 ) to our sample of early - type nuclei . in the upper panel ,",
    "we plot the physical sizes for both samples , where we have assumed a common distance of 16.5  mpc for the virgo galaxies ( tonry  2001 ; paper v ) .",
    "it is clear that the nuclear clusters of bker   ( 2004 ) have sizes similar to the early - type nuclei .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig22 ] compares the absolute magnitudes of the two samples .",
    "note that the observations of bker  ( 2004 ) were carried out in the f814w ( @xmath59 ) bandpass . comparing the means of the samples , we find the two populations to be comparably bright , with @xmath200 and @xmath201 for the early - type nuclei , and @xmath202 for the nuclear clusters .",
    "bker  ( 2002 ) further report that 59 of 77 late - type spirals in their survey contain a nuclear cluster close to the galaxy photocenter , giving an overall frequency of nucleation of @xmath203 . for comparison ,",
    "in  4.2 we estimated @xmath204 for our sample of early - type galaxies , counting galaxies with possible offset nuclei as non - nucleated .",
    "thus , in all these respects , the nuclear clusters found in late - type galaxies are nearly identical to the nuclei studied here .",
    "the lone point of distinction between the nuclear clusters and the early - type nuclei seems to be one of age : the majority of the nuclear clusters appear to have @xmath205 yr ( walcher  2005 and references therein ) , while the broadband colors rule out such young ages for _ all _ of the type  ia nuclei , irrespective of metallicity ( see  [ sec : stellpop ] and figure  6 of paper  i ) .",
    "this difference notwithstanding , the similar properties of the nuclei and nuclear clusters  and their appearance in galaxies of such disparate morphology  clearly points to a rather generic formation mechanism : e.g. , one which is largely independent of local or global environmental factors , such as the gas content and present - day morphology of the host galaxy , or the density of neighboring galaxies .",
    "the above conclusion applies equally well to the luminosity of the host galaxy : i.e. , the nuclei are not confined to just the dwarfs , but are also found with regularity in many of the giants .",
    "in fact , half ( 21/42 ) of the galaxies brighter than @xmath206 or @xmath10 ( the approximate division between dwarfs and giants in the vcc ) have classifications of type  ia or ib . the fact that nuclei are common above and below the canonical dwarf - giant boundary suggests that , at least in terms of their _ nuclear _ properties , there is no evidence for a fundamental change in galaxies at this magnitude .",
    "this is consistent with the mounting evidence from photometric scaling relations that the  dichotomy \" between normal and dwarf ellipticals , as originally envisioned by kormendy ( 1985 ) and others , may not be real ( e.g. , jerjen & binggeli 1997 ; graham & guzmn 2003 ; paper  vi ) .    on the other hand",
    ", there _ does _ appear to be a fundamental transition at @xmath15 in terms of nuclear properties .",
    "brighter than this , we measure @xmath207 and , in almost all cases , the presence of a nucleus can be ruled out with some confidence ( see appendix a ) .",
    "fainter than @xmath15 , the fraction of nucleated galaxies rises sharply , as shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig06 ] .",
    "it has been argued ( graham & guzmn 2003 ; trujillo  2004 ; graham 2004 ; paper  vi ) that this magnitude marks a transition from faint , srsic - law galaxies to bright , core - srsic - law galaxies , whose flat  cores \" are presumed to result from core depletion by coalescing of supermassive black holes ( ebisuzaki  1991 ; quinlan & hernquist 1997 ; faber  1997 ; milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ) .",
    "the absence of nuclei in galaxies brighter than @xmath15 is consistent with this scenario . of course",
    ", it is equally possible that these  missing \" nuclei are absent in the bright galaxies not because of the disruptive effects of mergers and black hole coalescence , but because they failed to form in such galaxies in the first place .",
    "discriminating between these competing scenarios should prove to be a fruitful area for future theoretical study .",
    "in almost all cases , the nuclei are found to be coincident with the photocenters of their host galaxies . in only five cases",
    "does there appear to be a statistically significant offset of @xmath208 .",
    "the bulk of the evidence , however , favors the view that these  nuclei \" are , in actuality , star clusters projected close to the galaxy photocenters . that is to say , the sizes , surface brightnesses and colors of the five possible offset nuclei more closely resemble those of globular clusters than those of the other nuclei in our sample .",
    "interestingly , all five of the host galaxies show some characteristics of dirr / de transition objects , including blue colors , low central surface brightnesses , the presence of dust , and a mottled or irregular appearance .",
    "this suggests that if dwarf ellipticals represent an evolutionary stage that follows gas exhaustion and stellar fading ( davies & phillips 1988 ) , ram pressure stripping ( mori & burkert 2000 ) or harrassment ( moore , lake & katz 1998 ) of gas - rich dirr / disk galaxies , then the formation of a central nucleus is not an immediate or inevitable consequence .",
    "additional time seems to be required to  grow \" a central nucleus .      because the theoretical framework for the globular cluster merger model is at a more mature stage than for any other model ,",
    "we now turn our attention to the question of whether this scenario is consistent with our new observations for the nuclei .",
    "we note that lotz  ( 2001 ) have previously examined the viability of the merger hypothesis on the basis of data collected for nuclei and globular clusters in their wfpc2 snaphot survey of dwarf galaxies . apart from identifying a possible depletion of bright clusters in the innermost regions of the galaxies",
    ", they could find no strong evidence for a merger origin of the nuclei , either from the spatial distribution of the clusters or from the measured luminosities of the nuclei .",
    "as pointed out in  4.6 , a comparison of the luminosity functions of nuclei and globular clusters in these galaxies shows that the _ typical _ nucleus is @xmath1 3.5 magnitudes brighter than a typical globular cluster .",
    "if cluster mergers are responsible for the formation of a central nucleus , then one might expect an average of @xmath75 25 mergers would be needed to assemble a nucleus from typical clusters . of course",
    ", as figure  [ fig20 ] shows , a single number does not tell the whole story .",
    "the four panels of this figure plot the distribution of nuclei and globular clusters in the color - magnitude diagram . for the brightest galaxies ( shown in the first panel ) ,",
    "the nuclei have a median luminosity @xmath1 125@xmath78 that of globular clusters at the peak of the cluster luminosity function . for the fainter galaxies ( shown in the three remaining panels ) ,",
    "the nuclei are brighter than a typical globular clusters by factors of 29 , 15 and 17 , respectively .    are these numbers feasible ? in figure  [ fig23 ] we attempt to answer this question by plotting the integrated luminosity in globular clusters against the luminosity of the nucleus for type  ia galaxies in our survey .",
    "results are shown in the upper panels , with measurements made in the @xmath28 and @xmath2 bands given in the left and right panels , respectively .",
    "as in figures  [ fig19 ] and [ fig20 ] , symbol type indicates the magnitude of the host galaxy . in calculating the total luminosity in globular clusters for these galaxies",
    ", we have simply summed the luminosities of globular cluster candidates with probabilities in the range @xmath209 .",
    "although this approach will obviously miss any globular clusters located outside the acs field , the correction should be small for the type  ia galaxies in our survey which , with @xmath210 , have @xmath211 15  or less ( paper  vi ) . the correlations apparent in these panels are a consequence of the fact that both the total number of globular clusters , and the luminosity of the nucleus , scale with host galaxy luminosity .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig23 ] plot the ratio of globular - to - nucleus luminosities , @xmath212 , in the two bandpasses . in both cases ,",
    "the ratio is near unity .",
    "this should perhaps come as no surprise since the mean nucleus - to - galaxy luminosity ratio , @xmath213% , found in  4.5 is nearly identical to the globular cluster formation efficiency of @xmath214% measured by mclaughlin ( 1999 ) for early - type galaxies .",
    "this latter measurement is in turn based on observations of 97 early - type galaxies and represents the total mass in globular clusters normalized to the total baryonic ( stellar + gas ) mass . while the agreement may be purely coincidental , it is a remarkable empirical result that the formation of early - type galaxies results in a nearly constant fraction of the initial baryonic mass , @xmath75 0.3% , being deposited into both globular clusters and , in many cases , a central nucleus .",
    "of course , this conclusion appears _ not _ to apply to galaxies brighter than @xmath15 , which lack nuclei either because they did not form in the first place or because they were subsequently destroyed by some as - yet - unidentified process .    in any case , galaxies which lie below the dashed line at @xmath215 in figure  [ fig23 ] pose a clear challenge to the merger model for the obvious reason that they simply have too few clusters to explain the luminosity of the nucleus .",
    "the difficulty is most severe for the dozen or so red nuclei associated with the brightest type  ia galaxies .",
    "of course , this argument is based on the number of clusters contained by the host galaxy _ at the present time_. if the observed clusters are the rare  survivors \" descended from a much larger initial cluster population , then it may be possible to circumvent this problem .",
    "an additional test of the merger model is possible .",
    "if the mergers were dissipationless so that star formation and chemical enrichment can be ignored , then we can use the observed colors of globular clusters to predict colors for the nuclei . since both globular cluster color and the fraction of red globular clusters are increasing functions of host galaxy luminosity ( paper  ix ) , we expect the nuclei in this model to become progressively redder in brighter galaxies .",
    "the heavy solid curve shown in the four panels of figure  [ fig20 ] shows the predicted color magnitude relation for nuclei which grow through globular cluster mergers .",
    "this curve is based on monte carlo experiments in which the color evolution of the nuclei is followed using the observed colors of the globular clusters in these galaxies .",
    "the thin curves show the 95% confidence limits on the relation .",
    "although these simulations do indeed predict redder colors for the brighter nuclei ( which are found preferentially in the brighter galaxies containing a larger proportion of red clusters ) , the predicted scaling is much milder than what is observed .",
    "bekki  ( 2004 ) have used numerical simulations to investigate the physical properties of nuclei which form through repeated mergers of globular clusters .",
    "their predicted scaling relation between half - light radius and luminosity , @xmath216 , is shown by the dotted line in figure  [ fig17 ] .",
    "the relation has a somewhat milder luminosity dependence than the observed relation , @xmath9 , but is nevertheless in reasonable agreement .",
    "a similar conclusion applies to the luminosity dependence of surface brightness averaged within the half - light radius .",
    "we find no strong correlation between @xmath217 and @xmath218 , but the predicted relation , @xmath219 ( shown as the dotted line in figure  [ fig18 ] ) , is reasonably consistent with the observations , having only a weak luminosity dependence . in the future , it will be of interest to compare the predicted and observed relationship between luminosity and central velocity dispersion .",
    "spectra for most of our program galaxies are now in hand and such a comparison will be the subject of a future paper in this series .",
    "ground - based spectroscopy will also be useful for investigating the history of star formation and chemical enrichment in the nuclei , although care must be exercised when decoupling the contributions from the galaxy and nucleus .",
    "this separation is more straightforward in the _ acs _ imaging , although in this case we are limited in our ability to measure ages and metallicities because of the well known age - metallicity degeneracy of broadband colors .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig24 ] shows linear interpolations of the [ fe / h]-@xmath220 relation for simple stellar populations from the models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "the four relations show color - metallicity relation for ages of @xmath221 = 1 , 2 , 5 and 10 gyr , although it is , needless to say , quite unlikely that a single age is appropriate for all of the nuclei in our sample . for comparison ,",
    "the heavy dashed curve in black shows the color - metallicity relation derived from globular clusters in the milky way , m49 and m87 ( paper  ix ) .",
    "if it is assumed that the nuclei have ages similar to the globular clusters , then this empirical relation may be used to derive metallicities for the nuclei .",
    "converting from colors to metallicities with these relations , we find the five metallicity distributions shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig24 ] .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : met ] . not suprisingly , the metallicity distributions derived from the models depend sensitively on the assumed age . for @xmath221",
    "= 10 gyr , the colors of the bluest nuclei , with @xmath222  mag , would require very low metallicities : i.e. , [ fe / h ] @xmath223 or less .",
    "by the same token , the reddest nuclei in our sample would require metallicities 1 - 100@xmath78 solar for an assumed age of 1 gyr .",
    "for ages as young as @xmath205 yr , which is appropriate for many of the nuclear clusters in late - type galaxies ( see  [ sec : boker ] ) no reasonable choice of metallicity can explain the colors of @xmath1 0.81.5 that are observed .",
    "thus , to the extent that the nuclei can be characterized by a single formation epoch , they show evidence for an old to intermediate age : i.e. , @xmath224  gyr . using the globular cluster color metallicity relation",
    "gives a mean metallicity of @xmath225}\\rangle$ ] = @xmath226  dex .",
    "firmer conclusions on the ages and metallicities of the nuclei must await the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "spectroscopic constraints on the mix of stellar populations in the nuclei should also shed some light on what may be the most serious challenge facing the merger model : the existence of a tight correlation between nucleus luminosity and color ( figures  [ fig19]-[fig20 ] ) .",
    "such a correlation is generally thought to be a signature of self enrichment in stellar systems , and is reminiscent of the color - magnitude relation for dwarf and giant galaxies ( e.g. , bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ; caldwell  1992 ) .",
    "that the colors correlate tightly with the luminosities of the nuclei , and less so with those of the host galaxies , suggests that the chemical enrichment process was governed primarily by local / internal factors .",
    "the existence of a tight color - magnitude relation for the nuclei is a difficulty for the merger model as envisioned by tremaine  ( 1975 ) since the clusters from which the nuclei are assembled show no color - magnitude relation themselves , and our monte - carlo experiments reveal the slope of the observed color - magnitude relation is steeper than that predicted in dissipationless cluster mergers .",
    "we speculate that the merger model in its original form ( i.e. ,  dry \" mergers of stellar clusters ) is an oversimplication of a process that almost certainly involves some gas dissipation .",
    "in fact , if nuclei do indeed have stellar ages of a few gyr old or more , then they were assembled during the earliest , most gas - rich stage of galaxy evolution .",
    "it would be interesting to revisit the merger model with the benefit of numerical simulations that include the effects of not just dark matter and stars , but also gas , to see if star formation and chemical enrichment caused by mergers / inflows are capable of producing a color - magnitude relation consistent with that shown in figure  [ fig19 ] .",
    "in a number of respects , the dozen or so bright nuclei labelled in figure  [ fig19 ] appear to form a population distinct from their faint counterparts , most notably in their integrated colors ( which appear redder than the galaxies themselves ) .",
    "these nuclei may be candidates for the  dense stellar cores \" which form in numerical simulations ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) when ( chemically - enriched ) gas is driven inward , perhaps as a result of mergers .",
    "our acs observations may also provide some clues to the origin of ucd galaxies . in terms of color , luminosity and size , the ucds from paper  vii bear a strong resemblance to many of the nuclei studied here , leading credence to the galaxy threshing scenario ( bassino  1994 ; bekki  2001 ) .",
    "however , these ucds were selected for study on the basis of luminosity and half - light radius , so it is unclear to what extent these conclusions may apply to the population of ucds as a whole .",
    "an unbiased survey of the ucd population in virgo should be undertaken to clarify this issue , although this will be a difficult and time - consuming task as it requires high - resolution spectroscopy and hst imaging to distinguish true ucds from bright globular clusters ( see  7 of paper  vii ) .",
    "jones  ( 2006 ) have recently reported the first results from a program to search for ucds in virgo using radial velocities for @xmath75 1300 faint , star - like sources in the direction of the cluster . however , lacking structural and internal dynamical information for ucd candidates found in this way , it is impossible to know to what extent their sample has been  polluted \" by globular clusters : either those associated with galaxies or intergalactic in nature ( e.g. , west  1995 ) .    for the time being , we may use the existing sample of virgo ucds from paper  vii and haegan  ( 2006 ) to re - examine the threshing model in light of our findings for the virgo nuclei . specifically , we may estimate the luminosities of the ucd progenitor galaxies within the context of the threshing model : for the typical ratio of nucleus - to - galaxy luminosity found in  4.5 , @xmath227% , we expect the progenitors to have @xmath228 , with a value mean of @xmath229 .",
    "if the threshing scenario is correct , then we might expect the surviving analogs of the ucd progenitors to resemble galaxies # 4069 in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that only about half ( 16/30 ) of these galaxies were classified as dwarfs by bst85 , meaning that a significant fraction of _ bright _ galaxies may need to have been  threshed \" to explain the ucd luminosity function within the context of this model .",
    "photometric , dynamical and structural parameters for these candidate ucd progenitor galaxies may serve as useful constraints for self - consistent numerical simulations of galaxy threshing and ucd formation .",
    "a large body of literature now exists on the sbhs that reside in the centers of many galaxies ( see , e.g. , the review of ferrarese & ford 2005 ) . while it had been known for some time that sbh masses , @xmath230 , correlate with the bulge masses , @xmath231 , of their host galaxies ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) , it was only after the discovery of a tight relation between @xmath230 and bulge velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2001 ; gebhardt  2001 ) that merritt & ferrarese ( 2001 ) were able to show that the frequency function for galaxies with sbhs has a roughly normal distribution in @xmath232 .",
    "fitting to the data available at that time , merritt & ferrarese ( 2001 ) found a mean of value of @xmath233 ( 0.13% ) and a standard deviation of 0.45  dex .",
    "remarkably , this mean value is , to within a factor of @xmath1 two , identical to the mean fractional luminosity contributed by nuclei to their host galaxies (  [ sec : lum ] ) .",
    "in fact , the nuclei and sbhs share a number of other key similarities that are highly suggestive of a direct connection : e.g. , they share a common location at the bottom of the gravitational potential wells defined by their parent galaxies and dark matter halos , and both are probably old components that formed during the earliest stages of galaxy evolution (  [ sec : stellpop ] ; haehnelt  1998 ; silk & rees 1998 ; wyithe & loeb 2002 ) . could it be that the compact nuclei which are found so frequently in the low- and intermediate - luminosity early - type galaxies are related in some way to sbhs dectected in the brighter galaxies ?",
    "figure  [ fig25 ] examines the connection between nuclei and sbhs in more detail . in the upper panel ,",
    "we show the distribution of absolute blue magnitudes , @xmath234 , for the 51 galaxies in our survey that contain type  ia nuclei ( solid histogram ) . this distribution should be compared to that for the early - type galaxies having sbh detections ( open squares and dotted histogram ) .",
    "this latter sample is based on data from table  ii of ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) , which reports sbh mass measurements from resolved dynamical studies for 30 galaxies . among this sample ,",

    "by contrast , the type ia galaxies have @xmath238  mag . note that this does _ not _ reflect the true upper boundary for nucleated galaxies , since nuclei definitely exist in galaxies brighter than this  table  [ tab : data ] lists 14 galaxies with certain or suspected nuclei ( i.e. , types ib , ic or i d ) having @xmath239  mag  but the high surface brightness of the host galaxies do not allow a reliable measurement of the nuclei luminosities or sizes . as we have argued in  [ sec : fund ] , the more fundamental cutoff seems to occur at @xmath6  mag since we find no nucleated galaxies brighter than this .    before moving on , we note that four of the galaxies with sbh masses in table  ii of ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) appear in our survey . in two cases",

    "we note that a similar conclusion has been reached independently by wehner & harris ( 2006 ) .",
    "models for the formation of sbhs in massive galaxies would then be confronted with the additional challenge of explaining the different manifestations of central massive object formation along the galaxy luminosity function , with an apparent preference for sbh formation above @xmath245  mag .",

    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * nuclei in early - type galaxies are more common than previously believed . excluding the six galaxies for which the presence of a nucleus could not be established , either because of dust obscuration or the presence of an agn , and counting the five galaxies with possible offset nuclei as non - nucleated",

    "half ( 21/42 ) of the galaxies brighter than @xmath10 are found to contain nuclei .",
    "this is almost certainly a lower limit on the true frequency of nucleation because of incompleteness and surface brightness selection effects in these bright galaxies .",
    "* on the other hand , galaxies brighter than @xmath15 appear to be distinct in that they do _ not _ contain nuclei  at least , not those of the kind expected from upward extrapolations of the scaling relations obeyed by nuclei in fainter galaxies . whether this means",
    "that nuclei never formed in these  core - srsic \" galaxies ( see paper vi and references therein ) , or were instead subsequently destroyed by violent mergers and core evacuation due to coalescing supermassive black holes , is unclear .",

    ", however , the available evidence ( i.e. , magnitudes , colors , half - light radii and surface brightness measurements ) suggests that such ",

    "* the central nuclei are _ resolved _ , with a few notable exceptions : such as the two agn galaxies , m87 and m84 , which have prominent non - thermal nuclei , and a half dozen of the faintest galaxies with very compact , but presumably stellar , nuclei .",
    "this observation rules out low - level agn as an explanation for the central luminosity excess in the vast majority of the galaxies . excluding those galaxies with faint , unresolved nuclei",
    ", we find the half - light radii of the nuclei to vary with luminosity according to the relation @xmath9 . *",
    "a gaussian distribution provides an adequate , though by no means unique , description of the luminosity function for the nuclei .",
    "the peak of the luminosity function occurs at @xmath248 and @xmath249 , or roughly 25@xmath78 brighter than the peak of the globular cluster luminosity functions in these same galaxies .",
    "we find the ratio of nucleus - to - galaxy luminosities to be @xmath250 0.3% , independent of galaxy luminosity but with significant scatter . *",
    "a comparison of the nuclei to the nuclear star clusters in late - type galaxies shows a remarkable similarity in luminosity , size and overall frequency .",
    "this suggests that a quite generic formation mechanism is required to explain the nuclei : one which is largely independent of local or global environmental factors , such as the gas content and present - day morphology of the host galaxy , or the density of neighboring galaxies . * in terms of color , luminosity and size , the ucds from paper  vii bear a strong resemblance to the compact nuclei in a number of these galaxies , leading credence to the  threshing \" scenario in which ucds are assumed to be the tidally stripped remains of nucleated galaxies .",

    "the mean of the frequency function for the nucleus - to - galaxy luminosity ratio in our nucleated galaxies , @xmath11  dex ( @xmath12 ) , is indistinguishable from that of the sbh - to - bulge mass ratio , @xmath13  dex ( @xmath14 ) , calculated in 23 early - type galaxies with detected sbhs .",
    "* we argue that the compact stellar nuclei found in many of our program galaxies may be the low - mass counterparts of sbhs detected in the bright galaxies , a conclusion reached independently by wehner & harris ( 2006 ) .",

    "in this view , sbhs would be the dominant mode of cmo formation above @xmath15 .    as the nearest large collection of early - type galaxies , the virgo cluster is likely to remain , for the forseeable future , at the center of efforts to understand the physical processes that drive nucleus formation .",
    "unfortunately , exploring the stellar dynamics of the most compact nuclei  and modeling the mass distribution within the central few parsecs of the host galaxies  requires integrated - light spectra with an angular resolution of @xmath75  01 or better .",

    "the approach used to classify galaxies according to the presence or absence of a central nucleus has been described in  4 .",
    "briefly , the classification procedure relies on both a visual inspection of the acs images and the detection of a central  excess \" in the brightness profile relative to the fitted srsic or core - srsic galaxy model .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : class ] .",
    "we find a total of 62 galaxies in which the presence of a nucleus could be established with a high level of confidence ( i.e. , the type  ia and ib galaxies ) .",
    "five more galaxies ( type  ie ) _ may _ contain an offset nucleus but , as we have argued above , the weight of evidence favors the view that these  nuclei \" are actually globular clusters .",
    "six other galaxies ( type  0 ) contain either an agn or dust at the photocenters , making the identification of a nucleus difficult or impossible .",
    "this leaves us with a sample of 100  62  5  6 = 27 galaxies which may be classified provisionally as non - nucleated .",
    "of course , the faintest , most extended nuclei will go undetected in any survey , especially when superimposed on a bright galaxy background .",
    "it therefore seems likely that at least some of these galaxies may , in fact , be nucleated . in this appendix",
    ", we attempt to elucidate the nature of these galaxies with the aid of numerical simulations guided by our findings from  4 .    for the 27 galaxies in question , figure  [ fig26 ] plots residuals , over the",
    "innermost 10 , between the _ observed _ brightness profile and the fitted models shown in figure  [ fig04 ] .",
    "because a few of these galaxies contain multiple components ( e.g. , rings , bars or shells ) , or have outer brightness profiles that are contaminated by the light of nearby giant galaxies , the profiles were sometimes fit over a restricted range in radius . in two cases where this outer fitting radius is @xmath251  ( vcc778 = ngc4377 and vcc575 = ngc4318 ) , an upward arrow shows the adopted limit . likewise , six galaxies ( vcc1664 = ngc4564 , vcc944 = ngc4417 , vcc1279 = ngc4478 , vcc355 = ngc4262 , vcc1025 = ngc4434 and vcc575 ) in which the presence of a faint central nucleus was suspected on the basis of an upturn in the central brightness profile , an upward arrow at 0203 shows the inner limit used to avoid biasing the fitted galaxy parameters . note that in most cases , the fitted srsic or core - srsic model provides a reasonably accurate match to the central brightness profile , meaning that any nuclei which may be hiding in these galaxies have had only a minor impact on the observed profiles",
    "of course , two possibilities exist for any given galaxy : either it contains a nucleus or it does not . to test the first possibility , we use the scaling relation from  4 which links the luminosity of the galaxy to that of its nucleus ( equation 6 ) . meanwhile , equation 11 provides a link between galaxy luminosity and nucleus size ( half - light radius ) . for each of the 27 galaxies in figure  [ fig26 ]",
    ", we then subtract a nucleus of the expected size and luminosity based on the magnitude of the galaxy itself .",
    "if the nucleus - subtracted profile of the galaxy is better represented by a sersic or core - srsic model than the original profile , this would be ( circumstantial ) evidence for the presence of a faint nucleus .",
    "the alternative possibility is that the galaxy is truly non - nucleated . in this case",
    ", we can _ add _ a simulated nucleus of the appropriate size and magnitude to see if it would be detectable from the images and/or the surface brightness profile .",
    "taken together , these two experiments allow us to crudely estimate the overall completeness of our survey and to refine the provisional classifications for these 27 galaxies .",
    "we caution , however , that the approach of adding and subtracting nuclei not only assumes that the scaling relations found in  4 are valid for all galaxies in the survey , but it ignores the significant scatter about the fitted relations .    with these caveats in mind",
    ", we present the results of this exercise in figure  [ fig26 ] . in each panel ,",
    "the small blue squares show the residuals profile obtained after adding a simulated nucleus to the image and recalculating the brightness profile .",
    "small red squares show the profile obtained if this nucleus is instead subtracted . for four galaxies ( vcc1692 , 1664 , 944 and 1025 )",
    ", the best - fit srsic / core - srsic model for the subtracted profile provides some improvement over the original fit .",
    "we therefore classify these four as galaxies as type  ic systems .    at the same time",
    ", we identify 12 other galaxies which can be classified unambiguously as non - nucleated ( type  ii ) . in these galaxies ,",
    "the subtracted brightness profiles show strong inward gradients in their central regions : an obviously non - physical result .",
    "interestingly , these 12 galaxies fall into two rather distinct categories : ( 1 ) _ bright giants _ which have shallow  cores \" in the central few arcseconds and thus are best fit with core - srsic models ; and ( 2 ) _ faint dwarfs _ which are best fit with pure srsic models . the common feature linking these two populations is the presence of a low - surface brightness core that facilitates the detection of a central nucleus .",
    "for this reason , we can say with some confidence that these 12 galaxies do _ not _ contain nuclei that follow the scaling relations observed in  4 for the type  ia galaxies .",
    "the final 11 galaxies remain elusive since we can neither confirm nor rule out the presence of a nucleus in these cases .",
    "we classify these objects as possibly nucleated ( type  i d ) .",
    "figures  [ fig06]-[fig07 ] clearly demonstrate that it is possible to detect nuclei in galaxies that span a wide range in luminosity and central surface brightness .",
    "but to what extent is our ability to detect nuclei  and to measure their sizes and magnitudes  affected by the surface brightness of the underlying galaxy and their own luminosity or size ? needless to say ,",
    "a complete characterization of the biases and incompleteness affecting the nuclei requires _ a priori _ knowledge of their intrinsic properties : information that we are obviously lacking .",
    "nevertheless , we may take a first step towards answering these questions by adding simulated nuclei of known size and magnitude to the center of a non - nucleated galaxy .",
    "for these experiments , we focus on a single non - nucleated galaxy , vcc1833 , which , as a srsic - law galaxy with a central surface brightness of @xmath252 and @xmath253  mag  arcsec@xmath128 , is representative of the type ia galaxies in our survey .",
    "nuclei that span a range in both magnitude and size were added to the galaxy photocenter .",
    "input magnitudes covered the intervals @xmath254 and @xmath255 in 1  mag increments ; at each magnitude , nuclei were added with half - light radii of 000 , 002 , 003 , 004 , 01 , 005 , 01 , 015 and 02 .",
    "simulations were carried out independently for the f475w and f850lp images , and for each simulation , the surface brightness profile was measured from the artificial image using the same procedure as for the real galaxy .",
    "a nucleated srsic model was then fitted to the profile of the simulated galaxy+nucleus and the best - fit parameters for the nucleus recorded .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown in figure  [ fig27 ] .",
    "the upper panel of this figure shows the difference between the recovered and input half - light radius , @xmath256 , as a function of input radius .",
    "the lower panel plots the difference between the recovered and input magnitude , @xmath257 , as a function of input magnitude . in both panels ,",
    "results are shown for the separate f475w and f850lp bandpasses ( blue and red squares , respectively ) .",
    "the symbol size is proportional to either input magnitude ( as in the upper panel , where larger symbols correspond to brighter nuclei ) or input radius ( as in the lower panel , where larger symbols correspond to more compact nuclei ) .",
    "there are several conclusions which may be drawn from this figure , although sweeping claims must be avoided because the results of the simulations will almost certainly depend on the central surface brightness of the galaxy , the steepness of its brightness profile , etc , so the findings are not generalizable to the other program galaxies in any straightforward way . with these caveats in mind ,",
    "we note that nuclei brighter than @xmath258  mag or @xmath259  mag in this particular galaxy would be detected for any choice of @xmath60 in the range 0 - 02 .",
    "conversely , nuclei fainter than @xmath260  mag or @xmath261  mag would never be detected .",
    "there appears to be no serious bias affecting the @xmath60 measurements for nuclei with @xmath262 , at least for nuclei brighter than @xmath263 2021  mag . in this size regime",
    " a range which encompasses half of the nuclei in table  [ tab : data ]  the input half - light radii are recovered to a precision of @xmath75 15% or better . for larger nuclei , with @xmath264 , there is a bias which ranges from @xmath265 10% for the brightest nuclei , to nearly a factor of two for the faintest detectable nuclei , in the sense that the recovered nuclei are smaller .",
    "unfortunately , the intrinsic distribution of nuclei sizes is unknown , so it is not possible to apply an _ a posteriori _ correction to the measured sizes . in any case",
    ", we note that the result from  [ sec : results ] that would be most directly affected by a bias of this sort is the observed scaling between nucleus and luminosity ( figure  [ fig17 ] ) , where it was found @xmath266 with @xmath267 . if we make the admittedly dubious assumption that the luminosity dependence of the bias found in the case of vcc1833 is representative of the full sample of type  ia galaxies , then we would expect the exponent in equation  11 to fall to @xmath268 .    for the faintest nuclei ,",
    "the simulations reveal that completeness is a function of surface brightness , in the expected sense that , at fixed luminosity , more compact nuclei ( i.e. , higher surface brightness ) are more likely to be detected .",
    "as the lower panel of figure  [ fig27 ] shows , there is also a tendency to measure fainter magnitudes for the simulated nuclei , at least in this galaxy .",
    "not surprisingly , the importance of this bias depends sensitively on the input magnitude ; for the brightest nuclei , the bias is less than @xmath269  mag in both filters , irrespective of the input @xmath60 . for the fainter nuclei",
    ", the bias can be as large as @xmath75 0.5  mag , and is slightly worse in the f850lp filter .",
    "to the extent that the simulations for vcc1833 are applicable to other galaxies in the survey , this means that the faintest type  ia nuclei may have measured colors that are systematically too blue by @xmath75 0.1  mag .",
    "two recent papers , de  propris  et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) and strader  ( 2006 ) , have presented magnitudes , colors and half - light radii for the nuclei belonging to a subset of our program galaxies . since the same observational material that forms the basis of our analysis was used in each of these studies",
    ", it is of interest to compare the various measurements .",
    "based on the vcc classifications that were available when the acs virgo cluster survey was begun , 25 of the 100 program galaxies were thought to contain nuclei ( see table  1 of paper  i ) . as we have shown in",
    " 4 , the actual number of nucleated galaxies in our survey is about three times larger than this , although in a number of cases the nuclei were too faint to determine reliable photometric or structural parameters ; in the final analysis , magnitudes , colors and sizes could be measured for 51 ( type  ia ) nuclei .",
    "we first consider the results of de  propris  et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who studied 18 of the 25 galaxies originally classified as nucleated dwarfs .",
    "these authors parameterized the underlying galaxies as srsic models . after subtracting this srsic component ,",
    "colors and magnitudes for the nuclei were determined by summing the light within a 1  aperture , while half - light radii for the nuclei were measured with the ishape software package ( larsen 1999 ) for a circular plummer profile and tiny tim psf .",
    "we have transformed the de propris  ( 2005 ) vegamag photometry onto the ab system using the zeropoints given in table  11 of sirianni ( 2005 ) .",
    "their half - light radii were converted from parsecs to arcseconds using their adopted virgo distance of 15.3  mpc .",
    "extinction corrections , which in both studies are based on the dirbe maps of schlegel  ( 1998 ) , were applied to our photometry as described in paper  ii .",
    "the two upper panels of figure  [ fig28 ] compare our magnitudes with those of de  propris  et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) ( filled circles ) , where the dashed lines show the one - to - one relations .",
    "there is only fair agreement between the measured magnitudes ( the @xmath84 scatter is @xmath1 0.30  mag in both bands ) . in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig28 ]",
    ", we compare our two estimates for the nuclei colors with those of de  propris  et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) . whether one uses integrated or aperture colors , the agreement is fair at best ( @xmath84 scatter @xmath1 0.17  mag in either case ) .",

    "( 2005 ) colors is largely driven by three galaxies  vcc200 , vcc1826 and vcc2050 ( ic3779 )  which de  propris  et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) find to host exeptionally blue nuclei , @xmath270  mag .",
    "for single burst stellar populations , such colors would require ages @xmath271  gyr for virtually any choice of metallicity ( see figure  6 of paper  i ) .",
    "by contrast , we measure colors in the range 0.81.2 for these three nuclei .",
    "in addition , we find poor agreement ( @xmath84 scatter = 0056 ) between the half - light radii measured in the two studies .",
    "in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig28 ] , we plot the de  propris  et  al .",

    "unfortunately , an internal comparison of the de  propris  et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) is not possible since they report a single value of the half - light radius for each nucleus , and it is not clear if this value refers to a measurement made in a single bandpass , or the average of measurements in the @xmath28 and @xmath2 bandpasses .",
    "figure  [ fig28 ] also shows a comparison of our magnitudes , colors and half - light radii for 25 nuclei to those of strader  ( 2006 ) ( open squares ) .",
    "the strader  ( 2006 ) measurements were also determined using the ishape package ( larsen 1999 ) , although these authors used an empirical psf and assumed a king model nucleus of fixed concentration index @xmath273 .",
    "although there is no discussion of how the contribution from the underlying galaxy was modeled in their analysis of the nuclei , the authors do state that photometry and size measurements for the nuclei were carried out using procedures identical to the globular clusters , in which the background is usually modeled as a constant or a plane . however , near the photocenter where the nuclei are found , the galaxy light is varying rapidly in both the radial and azimuthal directions , and since the galaxy brightness profiles nearly always exhibit an inward rise , this procedure will lead to overestimates of the nuclei luminosities and sizes .    from the upper panels of figure  [ fig28 ] , we see that the strader  ( 2006 ) magnitudes are , on average , @xmath75 0.4  mag brighter than ours .",
    "in addition , the discrepancy rises to @xmath274  1  mag for the faintest nuclei  those which should be most prone to errors in modeling the underlying galaxy light .",

    "<S> the acs virgo cluster survey is a _ hubble space telescope _ program to obtain high - resolution imaging , in widely separated bandpasses ( f475w @xmath0 and f850lp @xmath1 @xmath2 ) , for 100 early - type members of the virgo cluster , spanning a range of @xmath1 460 in blue luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we use this large , homogenous dataset to examine the innermost structure of these galaxies and to characterize the properties of their compact central nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we present a sharp upward revision in the frequency of nucleation in early - type galaxies brighter than @xmath3 ( @xmath4% ) and show that ground - based surveys underestimated the number of nuclei due to surface brightness selection effects , limited sensitivity and poor spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that previously reported claims that nucleated dwarfs are more concentrated to the center of virgo than their non - nucleated counterparts may be an artifact of these selection effects . </S>",
    "<S> there is no clear evidence from the properties of the nuclei , or from the overall incidence of nucleation , for a change at @xmath5 , the traditional dividing point between dwarf and giant galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> there _ does _ , however , appear to be a fundamental transition at @xmath6 , in the sense that the brighter ,  core - srsic \" galaxies lack resolved ( stellar ) nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> a search for nuclei which may be offset from the photocenters of their host galaxies reveals only five candidates with displacements of more than 05 , all of which are in dwarf galaxies . in each case , though , the evidence suggests that these  nuclei \" are , in fact , globular clusters projected close to the galaxy photocenter . working from a sample of 51 galaxies with prominent nuclei , we find a median half - light radius of @xmath7  pc , with the sizes of individual nuclei ranging from 62  pc down to @xmath8  2  pc ( i.e. , unresolved in our images ) in about a half dozen cases . excluding these unresolved objects , </S>",
    "<S> the nuclei sizes are found to depend on nuclear luminosity according to the relation @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> because the large majority of nuclei are resolved , we can rule out low - level agn as an explanation for the central luminosity excess in almost all cases . on average , the nuclei are @xmath1 3.5 mag brighter than a typical globular cluster . based on their broadband colors , </S>",
    "<S> the nuclei appear to have old to intermediate - age stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> the colors of the nuclei in galaxies fainter than @xmath10 are tightly correlated with their luminosities , and less so with the luminosities of their host galaxies , suggesting that their chemical enrichment histories were governed by local or internal factors . comparing the nuclei to the  nuclear clusters \" found in late - type spiral galaxies reveals a close match in terms of size , luminosity and overall frequency . a formation mechanism that is rather insensitive to the detailed properties of the host galaxy </S>",
    "<S> is required to explain this ubiquity and homogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> the mean of the frequency function for the nucleus - to - galaxy luminosity ratio in our nucleated galaxies , @xmath11  dex ( @xmath12 ) , is indistinguishable from that of the sbh - to - bulge mass ratio , @xmath13  dex ( @xmath14 ) , calculated in 23 early - type galaxies with detected supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the compact stellar nuclei found in many of our program galaxies are the low - mass counterparts of the sbhs detected in the bright galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> if this interpretation is correct , then one should think in terms of _ central massive objects _  either sbhs or compact stellar nuclei  that accompany the formation of almost all early - type galaxies and contain a mean fraction @xmath1 0.3% of the total bulge mass . </S>",
    "<S> in this view , sbhs would be the dominant formation mode above @xmath15 . </S>"
