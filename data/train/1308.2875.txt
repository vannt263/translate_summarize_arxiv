    "spin sensitive studies of individual magnetic adatoms and atomic ensembles on surfaces with spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( sp - stm ) @xcite have raised the necessity of a quantum - mechanical description of the spin dynamics evoked by sp - stm experiments .",
    "magnetization curves obtained in experiments are typically described using the expectation values of observables using a time independent , i.e. kinematic , gibbs ensemble average @xcite . however , an sp - stm measurement is a time - average of the orientation of a spin component selected by the given spin orientation of the probe tip .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the magnetization in the sample under the study remains unknown within the experimental resolution time .",
    "it would be helpful to compensate this lack of knowledge with theoretical investigations .",
    "when the stm tip comes towards an atom or a cluster under the study , the hamilton operator of the system changes due to the interactions with tunneling electrons .",
    "the perturbed dynamics drives the state out of equilibrium and the ergodicity is not a priory ensured .",
    "therefore , the ergodicity of a system has to be checked for a reliable interpretation of experimental results . a still unexplained",
    "finding is the extremely high switching frequency of co atoms on pt(111 ) at zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in contrast to magnetic atoms on insulating substrates co / pt(111 ) possesses very strong out - of - plane anisotropy ( 9 mev ) without any transversal contributions .",
    "hence , the hamiltonian of the free system is diagonal in the @xmath1 basis and , therefore , the tunneling rate is zero @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy barrier is approximately 100 times larger than the temperature used in experiments .",
    "therefore , the boltzmann probability to pass this barrier by thermal activation is also negligible .",
    "the measured magnetization , in contrast , is zero at zero field even in the regime of elastic tunneling , where the tunneling current density is minimal .",
    "a related problem is the so - called `` return to equilibrium '' , also referred as relaxation .",
    "the relaxation of an excited system depends on its initial state @xcite .",
    "there might exist some initial states from which the system can return to equilibrium and there might exist some other initial states from which this process will not happen .    the formal , mathematical description of systems which can be described by different hamilton operators before / after and during the measurement process has been elaborated in the framework described in @xcite .",
    "the algebraic approach to quantum statistical mechanics provides appropriate mathematical tools to verify the dynamical relaxation of a disturbed system ( return to equilibrium ) analytically @xcite .",
    "several theoretical aspects in the algebraic approach to quantum spin systems , such as propagation velocities , are of actual research interest @xcite-@xcite .",
    "particularly , it is proven that a mathematically exact return to equilibrium is ensured if the dynamical system satisfies some form of asymptotic abelianness and if the initial state is a perturbed kms state ( kubo - martin - schwinger ) @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use the algebraic formulation of quantum statistical mechanics @xcite to clearly separate the thermal equilibrium gibbs states and the time evolution of the system during sp - stm experiments .",
    "it is generally believed , that only large systems show a relaxation process .",
    "we demonstrate that also expectation values of relatively small quantum spin systems , containing less than 10 particles , return approximately to equilibrium when a perturbed kms state is used as an initial state .",
    "especially interesting is the theoretical analysis of the dynamics on time scales which are not accessible for an stm . using exact diagonalization we calculate the dynamics of single quantum spins during and after sp - stm measurements at finite temperatures .",
    "we demonstrate that the relaxation times of those quantum objects on different substrates lie in the femto- , pico- or nanosecond regime .",
    "it means that a good approximation of the long time behavior can be given for certain classes of real finite systems . to check whether the short time dynamics has a reliable behavior ,",
    "the calculated relaxation time has been compared with experimentally determined life times for single spins @xcite .",
    "ground states are obtained from kms states if the zero temperature limit is performed .",
    "the sp - stm set - up is approximated by ( in general ) two different hamiltonians in our approach .",
    "there is a hamiltonian @xmath2 for the free system and , if a measurement is started , we get an additional hermitian operator @xmath3 for the interaction between the tip and the sample . hence",
    ", if the tip is moved towards the surface , the system switches from @xmath2 to @xmath4 because of the sudden emergence of tunneling electrons causing the interaction between the tip and the sample .",
    "describes the free system and @xmath4 describes the perturbed system , i.e. the system with interaction between the tip and the sample . ]",
    "the stm - tip can be used to prepare a system with desired expectation values . for the corresponding state",
    "we choose a perturbed kms state @xmath5 .",
    "the reason for the application of this state is justified in the following text .    to describe a quantum spin system we consider particles on a lattice @xmath6 and associate with each point @xmath7 a hilbert space @xmath8 of dimension @xmath9 . with a finite subset @xmath10 we associate the tensor product space @xmath11 .",
    "the local physical observables are contained in the algebra of all bounded operators acting on @xmath12 .",
    "this is the @xmath0-algebra @xmath13 in which @xmath14 denote the algebra of @xmath15 complex matrices .",
    "physically , this can be interpreted as follows : at each lattice site @xmath16 there is a particle with spin quantum number @xmath17 and with @xmath18 degrees of freedom .",
    "the numerical calculations are done for systems of finite dimensions .",
    "the indices @xmath16 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are suppressed in the following text for clarity .",
    "a mixed ( or normal ) state @xmath21 is described as a normalized positive linear functional over the matrix algebra @xmath22 and is given by a density matrix @xmath23 . @xmath24",
    "the dynamical evolution of an observable @xmath25 for a system with hamiltonian @xmath26 can be described by the heisenberg relations @xmath27 thus , the map @xmath28 is a one - parameter group of @xmath29-automorphisms of the matrix algebra @xmath22 . in our formalism",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath2 describes a `` free '' quantum system without any interaction with the magnetic tip ( fig . 1 , left ) . when the spin - polarized current starts to flow through the system under investigation , the interaction between the tip and the sample is described by the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "1 , right ) .",
    "a perturbed dynamical evolution can be introduced by @xmath30 thermal equilibrium at inverse temperature @xmath31 is modeled by the gibbs canonical ensemble state which is also the unique @xmath32-kms state , denoted by @xmath33 and given by @xmath34 these states are invariant under the action of @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 , but in general not invariant under the action of @xmath37 .",
    "a corresponding perturbed @xmath38-kms state can be introduced by @xmath39 now we can plug the perturbed dynamics into the unperturbed equilibrium state @xcite @xmath40 the brackets @xmath41 shall mean that we calculate the time evolution of an expectation value for the observable @xmath42 .",
    "this corresponds to the situation when the spin - polarized tunneling current is switched on at the time @xmath43 and the system was in thermal equilibrium for @xmath44 .",
    "the function ( [ eq : measure ] ) is used to model the process of a measurement of a magnetization curve .",

    "the state @xmath5 can be prepared with sp - stm .",
    "the function ( [ eq : r ] ) can also be used to model the process of return to equilibrium .",
    "if a certain model hamiltonian is associated with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the evaluation of expectation values with ( [ eq : measure ] ) and ( [ eq : r ] ) can be calculated with different numerical methods . some other examples",
    "to which this approach can be applied can be found in @xcite-@xcite . to make connection to the more common theoretical models for sp - stm",
    ", we notice that @xmath3 could , for example , be given by a kind of s - d interaction or the tersoff - hamann model . the choice of @xmath3 to be a local magnetic field is appropriate to save memory , which is needed by the calculation of a relaxation process .",
    "a measurement in sp - stm is a time average over a time period @xmath46 .",
    "for example the time resolution of the measurement in @xcite is @xmath47 ms .",
    "each point on a measured magnetization curve corresponds then to the value : @xmath48 where @xmath42 is a spin component , i.e. , @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "it is worth to mention , that for infinite systems the equations ( [ eq : measure ] ) and ( [ eq : r ] ) are widely analysed in mathematical physics @xcite , but it seems that they were never applied to real physical spin systems . if the substitution @xmath51 is replaced by @xmath52 , comprehensive mathematical structures @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite can be applied for the analysis of physical systems . if any form of asymptotic abeliannes is satisfied one finds @xmath53 which motivates the application of perturbed kms states as states which can be prepared with an sp - stm . on the other hand @xmath54 which motivates the application of ( [ eq : r ] ) to calculate a relaxation process after the spin current has been switched off .",

    "another important effect at low temperatures are `` quantum fluctuations '' , which become extinct with increasing temperature .",
