    "microbial pathogens quickly acquire resistance to new antibiotics  @xcite , while solid tumors often regrow after treatment because of resistance mutations that arise during tumor growth  @xcite .",
    "in addition to genomic studies examining the molecular causes of resistance  @xcite , the dynamics of drug resistance evolution has recently attracted wide interest  @xcite , with the dual goal of understanding the emergence of resistance and developing novel strategies to prevent or control its spread  @xcite .",
    "next - generation sequencing and high - throughput experimental techniques enable the quantitative study of resistance evolution but require the development of new theories to appropriately interpret experimental results  @xcite .    in many realistic systems ,",
    "an evolving population interacts with its surroundings and exhibits a well - defined spatial structure ( for instance , in tumors and biofilms  @xcite ) .",
    "it has recently been shown that this spatial structure can strongly influence the subclonal structure and the adaptation of spatially expanding populations , both from _ de novo _ and pre - existing mutations  @xcite .",
    "likewise , spatial  @xcite or temporal  @xcite gradients in antibiotic concentration can enable populations to reach a higher degree of resistance than in homogeneous drug concentrations , at least in part because they enable the slow accumulation of multiple mutations , each conferring a small amount of resistance .",
    "the presence of spatial drug gradients is well documented both in the outside environment  @xcite as well as within biofilms  @xcite and the human body  @xcite , and it has been hypothesized that the presence of spatial heterogeneities may facilitate the emergence of drug - resistant phenotypes  @xcite . in a microfluidic experiment ,",
    "a spatial gradient indeed gave rise to a higher rate of adaptation of bacterial populations  @xcite .",
    "similarly , microbes growing on soft agar plates with gradually increasing antibiotic concentrations were able to rapidly evolve resistance to high levels of antibiotics , while sudden jumps to unsustainably high concentrations dramatically slowed down adaptation  @xcite .",
    "these findings raise the theoretical question of how to predict the rate of emergence of drug resistance in the presence of spatial gradients .",
    "a number of recent theoretical studies have investigated how gradients speed up the evolution of drug resistance  @xcite .",
    "each study made critical assumptions about the nature of the gradients : greulich et al .",
    "@xcite considered a population adapting to a smooth gradient , which gradually lowers the growth rate of susceptible individuals .",
    "hermsen et al .",
    "@xcite studied resistance evolution in a series of sharp step - like increases in concentration , where a novel resistance mutations was necessary for survival in the next step ( the `` staircase '' model ) ; hermsen  @xcite later proposed a generalization of the staircase model to continuous gradients .",
    "these previous studies focused on the speed of adaptation , i.e. , how quickly the population evolves to tolerate high concentrations of antibiotics . in the context of the emergence of drug resistance ,",
    "this observable alone ignores a crucial reality of antibiotic treatment : efficient drug treatment first and foremost aims to kill as many bacteria as possible , while limiting the rise of resistance mutation .",
    "how this apparent trade - off can be optimized to prevent the evolution of drug resistance has so far been unexplored .",
    "moreover , many realistic growth scenarios of bacterial populations may exhibit a directed flow that drives them up or down the gradient .",
    "examples include the gut , arteries , and urethra in the human body  @xcite , but also flows in aquatic environments , like ocean and river currents  @xcite , or flow in pipes and catheters  @xcite .",
    "the effect of convection on the evolution of drug resistance remains unknown .    here , we present simulations , rationalized by a comprehensive analytical framework , of populations evolving resistance in a variety of spatial antibiotic concentration gradients and under the influence of convection .",
    "we measure the establishment probability of resistant mutants arising in a region occupied by susceptible wild type , and the drug - induced death rate of the wild type , and show how bacterial diffusion , antibiotic gradient steepness , and convection interact to affect the treatment efficiency .",
    "we find that shallow gradients and convection into the antibiotic promote wild - type death , at the cost of increasing the establishment probability of resistance mutations .",
    "conversely , populations in steep gradients and subject to convection away from the antibiotics are less susceptible to drug - induced wild - type death but also produce fewer resistance mutants . the treatment efficiency , which quantifies the inherent trade - off between adaptation and death ,",
    "is strongly modulated by gradient steepness and convection .",
    "treatment efficiency is found to strongly depend on convection away from the antibiotic , which increases it in shallow gradients and decreases it in steep gradients .",

    "alternatively , the establishment  score  @xmath20 can be understood as a measure proportional to the mean establishment probability @xmath38 , i.e. , the probability that a mutation arising anywhere in the population establishes .",
    "finally , we define the efficiency @xmath24 of drug treatment via the amount of drug - induced wild - type death @xmath19 before an adaptive mutation establishes , i.e. , by @xmath39 .",

    "however , the trend changes dramatically for positive convection away from the gradient , which boosts treatment efficiency by a factor of 10 for shallow gradients and decreases it for the step - like antibiotic profile .",

    "[ fig : roverbandrandb]b ) illustrates the reason behind the qualitative behavior of treatment efficiency .",
    "both @xmath20 and @xmath19 show similar tendencies for different gradients and convection speeds : shallow gradients are characterized by larger values of both @xmath20 and @xmath19 than the step - like concentration profile .",
    "negative convection ( towards the gradient ) increases both @xmath20 and @xmath19 by up to a factor of 5 , while positive convection leads to their rapid decrease by two orders of magnitude .",
    "remarkably , in shallow gradients the establishment  score  @xmath20 is more sensitive than the total death rate @xmath19 to positive convection .",
    "the rapid decrease of @xmath20 explains the increase in the treatment efficiency @xmath45 for shallow gradients .",

    "the population density @xmath15 approximately tracks the net growth rate @xmath28 , while the establishment probability @xmath17 is roughly a mirror image of the population density . in the region where the drug concentration is low and",
    "the wild - type population is dense , the mutants have no advantage over the wild type , since they compete for the same resources , and are likely to go extinct due to genetic drift .",
    "conversely , in high drug concentration regions , the wild type can not survive and the mutants can grow freely and establish with high probability .",
    "convection has a rich variety of effects on both profiles .",
    "convection into the antibiotic ( co - flow , @xmath41 ) leads to broader profiles of both the wild type population density @xmath15 and the establishment probability @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cofxanduofx ] ) , while convection away ( counter - flow , @xmath21 ) from the antibiotic reduces both the population density and the establishment probability in the antibiotic region . for shallow gradients",

    "consequently , co - flow increases total death rate and establishment score , while counter - flow leads to their rapid decrease .    in summary ,",
    "our simulations show that both the population density profile @xmath15 as well as the local establishment probability @xmath17 of resistance mutants are strongly influenced by environmental parameters , in particular , by the steepness of the antibiotic gradient and the strength of convection . as a general rule of thumb , shallow gradients and",

    "we include diffusion and convection terms to account for the random dispersal and the effects of external flow on the bacteria .",
    "it is important at this point to note that in general the selective gradient @xmath28 will intimately depend on various environmental factors , including competition with the wild - type population . in later sections , especially when",

    "in order to fight an infection efficiently , an antibiotic must kill as many wild - type bacteria as possible before resistant mutants arise and survive against genetic drift . if a mutant arises in a low - concentration region , it has little advantage over the wild type and likely goes extinct .",
    "by contrast , a mutant arising in a high - concentration background will quickly establish , thus creating a resistant population that can populate regions in the antibiotic gradient inaccessible to the wild type .",
    "high population densities in high - concentration regions induce significant wild - type death , as the susceptible wild type can not survive well in these regions . on the other hand , high population densities in high - concentration regions",

    "we have studied this trade - off between drug - induced wild - type death and adaptation in an antibiotic gradient using simulations and analytical theory .",

    "similarly , for strong counter - flow , the drug - induced total death rate is decreased because the wild - type population density is low in high - drug regions , which in turn limits the rate of establishment of new resistance mutations .",
    "thus , making ad hoc predictions about the treatment efficiency is difficult .",
    "our detailed analysis of population density @xmath15 and establishment probability @xmath17 profiles over a wide range of gradient steepness and convection speeds shows that in shallow gradients , where both @xmath15 and @xmath17 are strongly affected by convection away from the antibiotic , treatment can become an order of magnitude more efficient than in no - flow scenarios .",

    ", mutation rates can be very small , typically less than @xmath132  @xcite , and thus our approximation may be accurate even for relatively large local populations .",
    "in addition , even when mutation rates are not small , we expect convection and spatial gradients to have the same qualitative effects on the establishment of resistance mutations , and thus our results should remain qualitatively correct in this case .",
    "individuals in our simulation merely occupy `` space '' in their specific deme ; in reality , bacteria have a finite size , and a population front can advance through mere growth , even against strong counter - flow  @xcite .",
    "conversely , for strong co - flow , individuals may de - adhere and be carried away from the bulk population , thus founding extant colonies that enjoy large growth rates in the absence of competition for resources .",
    "such processes can be studied by generalizing the diffusion term in our model to a long - range dispersal term as used frequently to model epidemics  @xcite .",
    "since long - range dispersal can allow individuals far from the population front to escape the bulk population , we expect it to increase the total establishment probability and thus the rate of adaptation relative to short - range dispersal as discussed here .",
    "we have only discussed one - dimensional populations here , but real surface - bound microbial populations typically grow as two - dimensional colonies , with complex spatial patterns . the establishment of beneficial mutations in microbial colonies has recently been discussed  @xcite . due to the particular strength of genetic drift at the front of such populations , beneficial mutations",
    "first have to reach a threshold size ( depending on the strength of the selective advantage ) neutrally before they become established .",
    "once the mutant clone reaches the threshold size , the selective advantage of the mutants can deterministically drive them to fixation in the population . during the initial phase , the mutant clone is contained between boundaries with characteristic stochastic properties that are not captured in our one - dimensional model  @xcite .",
