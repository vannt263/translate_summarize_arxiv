    "recent numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves in coronal arcades @xcite and in the interior of prominences ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shown later ) have revealed the presence of mhd waves propagating across the magnetic surfaces at slow velocities .",
    "it is standard to associate propagation across magnetic surfaces with fast magnetosonic mhd waves .",
    "however , the interpretation in terms of fast magnetosonic waves poses a problem since the apparent velocity of the cross - field propagation reported in those numerical studies is slower than that associated with a fast mhd wave and even a slow mhd wave .",
    "here we show an example of cross - field superslow propagation . figure .",
    "[ snapshots_los ] ( a ) and ( b ) show snapshots at a certain time of the simulation in @xcite , and fig .",
    "[ snapshots_los ] ( c ) shows the time evolution of the velocity component perpendicular to the plane along the slit in panel ( a ) . in this simulation ,",
    "radiative condensation happens at around time of 3000 s , and the waves are excited inside the flux rope . in fig .",
    "[ snapshots_los ] ( c ) , at the region apart from the center of the flux rope ( distance of 27 mm ) we clearly find waves which propagate outward and whose propagation speeds are decreasing with time .",
    "the propagation speeds are 15 km / s ( as shown by dashed lines in panel ( c ) ) , much slower than the characteristic propagation speeds of the fast mode ( @xmath0 160 km / s in our simulation settings ) and even the slow mode ( @xmath0 70 km / s ) .",
    "we think that the superslow propagation is explained as the apparent effect caused by phase mixing of standing alfvn or slow waves trapped in the closed loops of the flux rope . in the present paper , as a first step , it is argued that in magnetic structures of the solar corona as , e.g. , magnetic arcades , the phase mixing of continuum alfvn waves and/or continuum slow waves can create the illusion of mhd waves propagating across magnetic surfaces at velocities smaller than the characteristic sound and alfvn velocities of the plasma .",
    "this cross - field propagation is apparent because there is no real propagation of wave energy across the magnetic field .",
    "continuum alfvn waves and continuum slow waves live on individual magnetic surfaces and are associated with the alfvn continuum and slow continuum of the linear mhd spectrum @xcite .",
    "each magnetic surface can oscillate at its own local alfvn frequency and local slow frequency without interaction with neighbouring magnetic surfaces in ideal mhd and with negligible interaction in non - ideal mhd .",
    "if the continuum alfvn / slow waves on a collection of neighbouring magnetic surfaces are excited each at their own local alfvn / slow frequencies , an observer would see an apparent phase propagation across the magnetic surfaces due to the variation of the local alfvn / slow frequency across those surfaces @xcite .",
    "the apparent phase velocity is related to the spatial variation of the local alfvn / slow frequency across the magnetic surfaces and is slower than the alfvn / sound velocities for typical coronal conditions .",
    "the apparent propagation may be misleading for the analysis of simulations and observations , since this phenomenon could naturally be interpreted as fast mhd waves .",
    "therefore , understanding the nature of the apparent wave propagation is important for the correct analysis of numerical simulations and the correct interpretation of observations .",
    "computations of the continuous spectrum that are relevant for the present investigation can be found in , e.g. , , , , and @xcite .",

    "studied mhd waves in potential arcades as .",
    "they determined the variation of the frequencies of alfvn continuum modes across the magnetic surfaces for a specific density profile . subsequently studied the coupling of alfvn continuum modes and fast modes in the resistive driven problem for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the wavenumber in the @xmath1-direction ( the direction in the magnetic surfaces perpendicular to the magnetic field lines ) .",

    "@xcite computed the slow and alfvn continuum for a 2d prominence model with a purely poloidal magnetic field and gravity .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that apparent superslow propagation across the magnetic surfaces in solar coronal structures is a consequence of the existence of continuum alfvn waves and continuum slow waves . to this end",
    "we investigate the continuous spectrum for 2d equilibrium models in cartesian geometry that are invariant in the @xmath1-direction and have a purely poloidal magnetic field .",
    "the actual equilibrium configurations that we have in mind are 2d coronal arcades .",
    "the assumption that there is no toroidal magnetic field leads to two separate continuous parts .",
    "it simplifies the mathematical analysis and enables us to understand the essential mechanism behind the apparent superslow propagation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the concept of continuous spectrum of linear ideal mhd and we recall the equations that govern the continuous spectrum for a 2d magnetostatic equilibrium in cartesian coordinates with a purely poloidal magnetic field . in section 3",

    "the apparent cross - field propagation caused by the phase mixing of continuum waves is studied in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we use the theory of apparent superslow propagation due to continuum alfvn waves to explain the superslow propagation observed in the numerical simulations by @xcite .",
    "conclusions are formulated in section 6 .",
    "the continuous part of the linear spectrum of ideal mhd was first studied for 1d magnetostatic equilibrium models .",
    "@xcite were the first to give a rigorous proof that the linear spectrum of ideal mhd contains a continuous part .",
    "their analysis applied to a 1d axisymmetric circular plasma cylinder , known in the plasma physics literature as the diffuse linear pinch .",
    "waves belonging to the continuous part of the spectrum are recognized by their singular behaviour at a magnetic surface . in the case of a 1d magnetostatic equilibrium model ( e.g. the plasma slab , the diffuse linear pinch ) the linear mhd equations",
    "can be reduced to the classic hain - lust equation .",

    "the determination of the frequencies of the continuous part of spectrum is relatively straightforward : put the coefficient function of the highest derivative in the hain - lust equation equal to zero .",
    "the resonant frequencies are given by simple algebraic relations .",
    "for 2d equilibrium models matters are more complicated .",
    "the equations for the linear motions are partial differential equations .",
    "the continuous spectrum is redefined as the collection of frequencies for which the solutions show non - square integrable singularities at a flux surface @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite were the first to determine independently the equations that govern the continuous part of the linear ideal spectrum for 2d toroidal equilibrium configurations in the context of fusion plasma physics .",
    "they also derived basic properties of the continuous spectrum that do not depend on the details of the magnetic field .",
    "in particular they showed that in the general case of a mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic field the alfvn continuum and the cusp continuum become coupled and the continuum modes are no longer polarized purely parallel and purely perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",

    "the two continua are uncoupled and the corresponding solutions have the classic properties known from the analysis of the diffuse linear pinch . here the alfvn continuum is not affected by gravity , but the slow continuum is affected and it might be better referred to as the slow - gravity continuum .",
