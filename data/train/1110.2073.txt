    "each spin has only 4 nearest neighbors and 4 next - nearest neighbors , which is comparable to the two - dimensional square lattice antiferromagnet ( 2dsl - af ) .",

    "further , that all @xmath33 s show the same temperature evolution ( i.e. similar @xmath38 and transition temperature ) suggests that the multiple frequencies are not caused by the coexistence of different magnetic phases but rather a result of several inequivalent interatomic muon stopping sites within the crystallographic lattice .     where @xmath34 ) .",

    "such non - zero phases along with a rather asymmetric field distribution [ see e.g. the fft spectrum in fig .",
    "3(c ) ] could be an indication for incommensurate magnetic order in this compound .",
    "however , it is more likely that such phase - delays are caused by a wide field distribution due to the large amount of inequivalent muon sites , as we have previously reported for the licro@xmath41 compound @xcite .",
    "this is clearly also in line with the neutron diffraction data that indeed show a clear commensurate order @xcite .    finally , the zf data obtained just above @xmath5 [ @xmath15  =  70  k in fig .",
    "4(a - b ) ] show no indication of short - range magnetic order .",
    "instead it is well fitted by a simple static gaussian kubo - toyabe ( kt ) function [ @xmath42 multiplied by an exponential relaxation : @xmath43 here @xmath44 originates from the presence of randomized ( nuclear ) magnetic moments . from such fit",
    "we obtain @xmath45  mhz along with @xmath46  mhz for @xmath47  k. the negligible value of @xmath48 indicates the absence of any strong fluctuations in the electronic moments ( spins ) .",

    "both wtf and zf measurements show a clear long - range 3d magnetic order below @xmath6  =  61.7  k. contrary to suggestions by susceptibility measurements and inelastic neutron scattering , we further find no clear evidence for either static or dynamic ( on the time - scale of @xmath7sr ) spin - correlations above @xmath5 .",
