    "in recent years , there is much interest in event - by - event hydrodynamics .",
    "event - by - event hydrodynamics takes into account that in nucleus - nucleus collisions , participant nucleon positions fluctuates from event to event .",
    "effects of such fluctuations are most prominent on the azimuthal distribution of the produced particles . in a non - zero impact parameter collision between two identical nuclei ,",
    "the collision zone is asymmetric .",
    "multiple collisions transform the initial asymmetry into momentum anisotropy .",
    "momentum anisotropy is best studied by decomposing it in a fourier series ,    @xmath3 , n=1,2,3 ... \\ ] ]    @xmath4 is the azimuthal angle of the detected particle and @xmath5 is the plane of the symmetry of initial collision zone . in central rapidity region , for smooth initial matter distribution ( obtained from geometric overlap of density distributions of the colliding nuclei ) , plane of symmetry of the collision zone coincides with the reaction plane ( the plane containing the impact parameter and the beam axis ) , @xmath6 .",
    "the odd fourier coefficients are zero by symmetry .",
    "however , fluctuations in the positions of the participating nucleons can lead to non - smooth density distribution , which will fluctuate on event - by - event basis .",
    "the participating nucleons then determine the symmetry plane ( @xmath7 ) , which fluctuate around the reaction plane @xcite . as a result odd",
    "harmonics @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ... , which in central rapidity region are exactly zero for smoothed initial distribution , can be developed . in rhic and lhc energy collisions , odd harmonics has indeed been measured in experiments @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "explicit event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic heavy ion collisions also results in odd harmonics @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite .",
    "while momentum anisotropy is best studied by fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution , in the present paper we explore the possibility of using another observable , namely the slope parameter of the transverse momentum distribution for the produced particles . in experiments",
    "azimuthal angle integrated transverse momentum distribution ( @xmath11 ) of produced particles are routinely measured .",
    "angle integrated momentum distribution is of exponential nature .",
    "slope ( @xmath12 ) of the distribution can be interpreted approximately as the temperature of the fireball produced in the collisions . in event - by - event hydrodynamics",
    "the initial medium is granular and even in central collisions have azimuthal dependence . as a consequence the freeze - out surface can have azimuthal dependence .",
    "the invariant particle spectra will depend on the azimuthal angle .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations indicate that the invariant spectra @xmath13 remains exponential even as a function of the azimuth .",
    "asymmetry in the momentum distribution then be reflected as the azimuth dependent slope parameter ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "experimental measurements can be easily extended to study of azimuthal fluctuations in the slope parameter .",
    "the data can serve as additional constraint for hydrodynamical modeling .",
    "in the present paper , in event - by - event hydrodynamics , we have simulated @xmath15=200 gev 30 - 40% au+au collisions and studied azimuthal fluctuations of the slope parameter .",
    "when averaged over many events , azimuthal fluctuation in the slope parameter is very similar to that of azimuthal distribution ; though less pronounced . in a single event",
    "however , the slope parameter appears to fluctuates more strongly over the azimuth than the azimuthal distribution . in analogy to the fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution @xmath2 , we have fourier expanded azimuth dependent slope parameter .",
    "the expansion coefficients of the slope parameter and that of azimuthal distribution appear to be strongly correlated .",
    "strong correlations between two expansions coefficients suggest that like the azimuthal distributions , azimuth dependent slope parameter can be used to characterise the momentum anisotropy .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec2 ] the hydrodynamic model used presently is briefly discussed . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "simulation results are discussed and finally in section [ sec4 ] conclusions are drawn .",
    "in event - by - event hydrodynamics , one generally solves for the energy - momentum and baryon number conservation equations ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath18 is the particle 4-current .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are energy density , pressure , net baryon density and hydrodynamic 4-velocity respectively .",
    "@xmath23 is the metric tensor .",
    "presently we assume that fluid is baryon free and disregard eq.[eq3 ] .",
    "we also disregard any dissipative effect . assuming boost invariance we solve the equations with the code azhydro - kolkata @xcite in @xmath24 coordinate system .",
    "hydrodynamics equations ( eq.[eq1 ] ) are closed with an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath25 .",
    "presently , we use an equation of state where the wuppertal - budapest @xcite lattice simulations for the deconfined phase is smoothly joined at @xmath26 mev , with hadronic resonance gas eos comprising of all the resonances below mass @xmath27=2.5 gev .",
    "details of the eos can be found in @xcite .",
    "solution of hydrodynamic equations requires to specify the fluid energy density distribution @xmath28 , velocity distribution @xmath29 at the initial time .",
    "a freeze - out prescription is also needed to convert the information about fluid energy density and velocity to invariant particle distribution .",
    "we assume that at the initial time @xmath30=0.6 fm initial fluid velocity is zero , @xmath31 .",
    "the freeze - out temperature is fixed at @xmath32=130 mev . for the initial energy density distribution",
    "we resort to monte - carlo glauber model .",
    "details of the monte - carlo glauber model can be found in @xcite . in a monte - carlo glauber model , according to the density distribution of the colliding nuclei , two nucleons are randomly chosen .",
    "they are assumed to interact if the transverse separation is below @xmath33 . for rhic energy collisions @xmath34 , a value used in the present simulations .",
    "transverse position of the participating nucleons ( which are known in each event ) will fluctuate from event - to - event .",
    "if a particular event has @xmath35 participants , participants positions in the transverse plane can be labeled as , @xmath36 .",
    "energy density distribution in the particular event can be obtained by assuming that each participant deposits energy @xmath37 in the transverse plane ,    @xmath38    for use in fluid dynamical models , the discrete density distribution is smoothed by smearing the participant positions by a gaussian function ,    @xmath39    in @xcite@xcite , influence of the gaussian width i.e. the smoothing parameter @xmath40 , on flow coefficients were studied in au+au collisions .",
    "elliptic and triangular flows are minimally influenced by the smoothing parameter @xmath40 .",
    "higher flow coefficients , however are influenced by the choices of @xmath40 .",
    "presently , we have used @xmath40=0.25 fm .",
    "let us first demonstrate the feasibility of slope parameter in characterising momentum anisotropy of final state particles .",
    "we have simulated 30 - 40% au+au collision at rhic energy , with two initial condition ic-1 and ic-2 .",
    "ic-1 is a randomly chosen mc glauber model initial condition and ic-2 is the initial condition obtained by averaging over average of 500 mc events . in fig.[f1]a and ( b ) ,",
    "energy density distributions for the two initial conditions are shown .",
    "when averaged over large number of events , the initial condition is rather smooth as it is in smooth hydrodynamics ( obtained from optical glauber model calculations ) .",
    "initial condition ic-1 , corresponding to a single mc event clearly shows granular structures .    in fig.[f1]c and d , angular dependence of @xmath41 spectra from the evolution of initial distributions",
    "ic-1 and ic-2 are shown .",
    "spectra are shown for azimuthal angle @xmath4=0 , 1.26 , 2.51 , 3.77 , 5.03 and 6.28 respectively . in the inset of [ f1]c and d , spectra",
    "are shown in a limited @xmath42 range .",
    "for ic-2 , as expected , the spectra do not show any angular dependence .",
    "the angular dependence however is manifestly presented in ic-1 .",
    "we also note that at any angle the spectrum is of exponential nature , @xmath43 .",
    "azimuth dependent slope parameter then can be used to probe momentum anisotropy of the final state particles . in smooth hydrodynamics ,",
    "the azimuth independent slope parameter can be interpreted as effective temperature of a single fireball emitting particles .",
    "azimuth dependent slope parameter then can be interpreted as the temperatures of multiple sources .      for 500 mc glauber events we have simulated @xmath41 production in 30 - 40% au+au collisions at rhic . for each event",
    "we find the slope parameter ( @xmath14 ) between @xmath42=1 - 2 gev , and compute the fluctuations in @xmath14 as ,    @xmath44    in simulations we also have calculated the azimuthal distribution @xmath2 in each of the event .",
    "fluctuations in azimuthal distribution are calculated in a similar way ,    @xmath45    in fig.[f2 ] azimuthal fluctuations @xmath46 and @xmath47 are shown . in fig.[f2]a , the circles with error bars shows the azimuthal variation for the event averaged fluctuations @xmath48 . when averaged over all the events , the slope parameter does not show rapid variation with azimuth .",
    "however , large error bars do indicate that at any azimuth , event - by - event variations are rather large . in fig.[f2]a ,",
    "the red line is the fluctuations in the event ic-1 . @xmath14 more oscillates",
    "more rapidly than the event averaged value .",
    "fig.[f2]b shows the azimuthal variation @xmath47 .",
    "event averaged @xmath49 fluctuations are similar to that of the slope parameter , though more pronounced . in fig.[f2]b ,",
    "the red line indicate azimuthal variation of @xmath50 in the event ic-1 . in a single event , unlike @xmath51 , @xmath50 oscillates less rapidly .      as in eq.[eq1 ] , azimuthal anisotropy of slope parameter can be studied by fourier expansion ,    @xmath52 , n=1,2,3 ... \\ ] ]    where the expansion coefficients are labeled as @xmath53 , @xmath54 .. etc . in eq.[eq8 ] ( also in eq.[eq1 ] ) @xmath5 is the participant plane angle . in event - by - event hydrodynamics ,",
    "one generally characterise the asymmetry of the initial collision zone in terms of various moments of the eccentricity ( @xmath55 ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ,    @xmath56    which also determine the participant plane angle @xmath5 .    to understand the implications of the coefficients @xmath0 ,",
    "let us remember that the physical implications of the flow coefficients @xmath1 in eq.[eq1 ] . in fig.[f3 ] schematic diagram of the azimuthal distribution @xmath2 with finite @xmath57 and with finite @xmath9 are shown in polar coordinates . for finite @xmath57 , in the transverse plane",
    ", the distribution is elliptical , particles are preferentially produced at @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the same for distribution with finite @xmath9 however is triangular in shape .",
    "preferential emission occurs in three direction , @xmath4=0 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in fig.[f3 ] solid circles shows the azimuthally symmetric distribution when @xmath57 or @xmath9 are zero .",
    "microscopically , due to multiple collisions , initial asymmetry in spatial density distribution gets converted into asymmetry in the momentum space distribution .",
    "if it is assumed that particles are emitted from a hot fireball in the momentum space , then for finite @xmath57 ( @xmath9 ) , momentum space density distribution of the fireball , in the transverse plane is elliptical ( triangular ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath1 in eq.[eq1 ] are called flow coefficients as they indicate preferential flow of particles in certain directions .",
    "physical implication of the coefficients @xmath0 in fourier expansion of the slope parameter is similar to that of the flow coefficients @xmath1 . in a distribution with finite @xmath54 , in the transverse plane fireball temperature is not uniform rather elliptical in shape , more along @xmath4=0 and @xmath62 and less in other directions .",
    "similarly fireball temperature will be of triangular shape in distribution with finite @xmath63 . in a fireball picture",
    "such angular dependence implies that a number of fireballs participate in particle production .",
    "considering the similarity with flow coefficients @xmath1 , in the following @xmath0 will be called temperature flow coefficients .",
    "similar to flow coefficients , microscopic origin of temperature flow coefficients is also the asymmetry in the initial ( spatial ) density distribution .    in a hydrodynamic model flow coefficients @xmath1 are response of the initial ( spatial ) asymmetry of the medium produced in the collisions .",
    "they are expected to be strongly correlated with initial eccentricity measured @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , in smooth hydrodynamics elliptic flow is strongly correlated with initial eccentricity @xmath64 . in event - by - event hydrodynamics correlation between flow coefficient @xmath1 , with initial eccentricity measures @xmath55 has been studied previously @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it was shown that in event - by - event hydrodynamics , elliptic flow is strongly correlated with initial eccentricity .",
    "comparatively weak correlation was observed between triangular flow and initial triangularity .",
    "correlation between higher flow coefficients and asymmetry measures gets even weaker .",
    "de - correlation of higher order flows could be understood as due to nonlinear mixing of modes @xcite .",
    "for example , gardim et al @xcite showed that in order to correctly predict @xmath65 and @xmath10 , one must take into account nonlinear terms proportional @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    ".[table1 ] correlation measure for ( i ) flow harmonics ( @xmath1 ) and eccentricity ( @xmath68 , ( ii ) temperature flow coefficients ( @xmath0 ) and eccentricity ( @xmath68 , and ( iii ) between temperature flow coefficients ( @xmath0 ) and flow coefficient ( @xmath1 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as we have argued here , temperature flow coefficients @xmath0 are also responses of the initial ( spatial ) asymmetry of the system . how they are correlated with initial eccentricity measures is an interesting study . in fig.[f4 ] , we have studied the correlation between initial eccentricity ( @xmath55 ) and temperature flow coefficients ( @xmath0 ) . for each of the 500 mc - glauber events the slope parameter @xmath14 was fourier",
    "expanded to find out the temperature flow coefficients @xmath0 , n=1,2, .. 5 . in the left panel of fig.[f4 ] , for the 500 events , the temperature flow coefficients @xmath0 ( n=1,2, .. 5 ) are plotted against initial eccentricity measure @xmath55 . for a perfect correlation @xmath69 and",
    "all the events should lie on a straight line .",
    "it is evident from our simulations that temperature flow coefficients are weakly correlated with initial eccentricity measures .",
    "the result is not a complete surprise . from our previous studies ,",
    "we know that with the exception of elliptic flow @xmath57 , the flow coefficient @xmath1 are also weakly correlated with initial eccentricity measures .",
    "it is evident from the middle panel of fig.[f4 ] where we have plotted the flow coefficients @xmath1 against the eccentricity measures @xmath55 .",
    "as expected , only @xmath57 appears to be strongly correlated with @xmath64 .",
    "other flow coefficients are weakly correlated with eccentricity measures . in the right panel of fig.[f4 ] , we have plotted temperature flow coefficients @xmath0 against the flow coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , temperature flow coefficients @xmath0 and flow coefficient @xmath1 appear to be strongly correlated .",
    "in @xcite@xcite a quantitative measure was defined to quantify the correlation between flow coefficients and initial spatial asymmetry measure .",
    "@xmath70 ^ 2}{\\sum_i [ v^i_{random}(\\epsilon ) -v_{st.line}(\\epsilon ) ] ^2}\\ ] ]    @xmath71 essentially measures the dispersion of the simulated flow coefficients from the best fitted straight line , relative to completely random flow coefficients .",
    "it varies between 0 and 1 .",
    "if flow coefficients are perfectly correlated then @xmath72 and @xmath71 is identically unity . for completely random flow coefficients , @xmath71=0 .",
    "to obtain an even ground for comparison of @xmath71 for different flow coefficients , the flow coefficients ( @xmath1 ) and the asymmetry parameters ( @xmath55 ) are scaled to vary between 0 and 1 .",
    "a similar equation can be used to quantify the correlation between temperature flow coefficients @xmath0 and initial asymmetry measure @xmath55 or between temperature flow coefficients @xmath0 and flow coefficients @xmath1 . in table.[table1 ] , we have listed the @xmath71 values for correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath55 , between @xmath0 and @xmath55 and between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "quantitatively compared to flow coefficients @xmath1 , temperature flow coefficients @xmath0 are less correlated with @xmath55 .",
    "the difference is most prominent for second harmonic n=2 and lessened in higher order harmonics .",
    "@xmath71 values also indicate that the correlation between temperature flow coefficients @xmath0 and flow coefficient @xmath1 are rather high for all n. @xmath0 and @xmath1 are much better correlated than the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath55 or between @xmath0 and @xmath55 .",
    "event - by - event hydrodynamic simulation result that the temperature flow coefficients @xmath0 and flow coefficients @xmath1 are rather strongly correlated strongly suggests that apart from the azimuthal distribution @xmath2 , the azimuthal fluctuations in the slope parameter of invariant spectra can as well be used to study final state momentum anisotropy .",
