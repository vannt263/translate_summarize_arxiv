    "it was the great physicist andrei sakharov who made the link between the puzzling experimental discovery of cp violation ( cpv ) , with the even more puzzling baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) : the absence of antimatter from the observable universe .",
    "the bau puzzle is as follows . at the big bang ,",
    "equal amounts of matter and antimatter ought to be produced .",
    "of course , they will mutually re - annihilate as the universe cools , and indeed this feeds eventually the cosmic microwave background radiation . but why then is _ any _ matter left , and at roughly @xmath0 of the primordial production ?",
    "sakharov s three conditions@xcite for this to occur is :    baryon number violation ;    cp violation ;    deviation from equilibrium .",
    "it is truly remarkable that the standard model ( sm ) satisfies condition ( i ) in a nontrivial way , provides cpv phase(s ) in the charged current through quark mixing , and one is hopeful for nonequilibrium through the  condensation \" that lead to spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "alas , the sm seems _ insufficient _ in conditions ( ii ) and ( iii ) : the amount of cpv in the three generation kobayashi ",
    "maskawa model falls far short from what is needed , as we shall see in the next section , while the phase transition seems too smooth because the higgs boson is not light enough .",
    "it has therefore been popular to invoke  baryogenesis through leptogenesis \" , namely that bau occurs first through lepton  antilepton imbalance , then transferred to baryons by the electroweak forces in sm .",
    "i offer some comments .",
    "leptogenesis based on traditional seesaw mechanism for generating tiny neutrino mass , through right - handed majorana scale at @xmath1 gev or higher , is rather beautiful .",
    "however , it appears to be  metaphysics \" , in the sense that it can not be experimentally tested in the foreseeable future ! then , there are the type ii and iii , etc . seesaw models that bring in more assumptions , in good part to make them more accessible at the lhc ( or future machine ) , and the models become less beautiful .",
    "this pushes the traditional - minded physicists like myself to yearn for the sm , since it satisfies all _ necessary _ conditions of sakharov , albeit insufficiently in two of them . with the caution that we have no right that ",
    "the theory of our time \" would touch so deeply the core to the universe ( and our existence ) , we do like to ask :    0.2 cm    _ can one restore tev scale baryogenesis ? _    0.2 cm    _ what about the source of cp violation ? _    0.2",
    "cm this talk tries to touch upon these profound issues , especially on the cpv front .",
    "cp violation was forced upon us by experimental discovery , which caused the pure minds such as dirac to depress .",
    "but it in fact opened our minds further to deeper truths on the antimatter world that dirac himself uncovered for us .",
    "sakharov wrote down his conditions in 1966 ( published in 1967 ) , which was clearly stimulated by the experimental observation,@xcite in 1964 , of cp violation in @xmath2 decay , now interpreted as the physical @xmath3 meson having a small admixture of the @xmath4 state .",
    "the 1980 nobel prize was awarded to james cronin and val fitch for their experimental discovery .",
    "the pursuit was on for the  direct \" cpv ( dcpv ) , i.e. in decay , within the kaon system , which was finally established@xcite in 1999 .",
    "it was the two ( then ) young japanese physicists , makoto kobayashi and toshihide maskawa ( km ) , who pointed out@xcite in 1972 ( published in 1973 ) that if a third generation ( 3 g ) of quarks exist , then a unique cpv phase appeared in the @xmath5 quark mixing matrix governing the charged current .",
    "it is remarkable that , at that time , even two generations were not completely established .",
    "but within a few years , the @xmath6 quark , the @xmath7 lepton , and the @xmath8 quark were all discovered , although it took another 18 years before the top quark was discovered at the tevatron .",
    "but the main issue for km was cp violation .",
    "the picture was convincingly confirmed@xcite between the belle and babar experiments in 2001 , and the pair was awarded 1/2 the 2008 nobel prize .",
    "what is remarkable , and reflecting the prowess of these b factory experiments , is that dcpv in the @xmath9 system , in the form of difference in rate for @xmath10 vs. @xmath11 , was the highlight observation of 1994 .",
    "it came a mere three years after the nobel prize defining measurement of mixing - dependent cpv ( tcpv ) in 2001 , which is in contrast to the tortuous path of 35 years for the kaon system .",
    "we will discuss further developments which sprang from the observation of dcpv in the b system , in the next section .",
    "what km pointed out was that , while the @xmath12 quark mixing matrix of the charged current ( weak coupling @xmath13 modulated as @xmath14 ) is real , a unique , irremovable phase appeared in the @xmath5 generalization .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath15 can be parameterized@xcite in the form where the @xmath12 sector is real to very good approximation , while it is traditional ( a phase convention ) to put the unique cpv phase in the @xmath16 element , which is then reflected in the @xmath17 element by unitarity , or @xmath18 .",
    "unitarity of @xmath15 correlates multiple physical measurables involving flavor and cpv .",
    "one such condition is the relation @xmath19 from @xmath20 .",
    "the km condition for cpv is that the triangle formed by eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) should be _ nontrivial _",
    ", i.e. the _ area _",
    "@xmath21 of the triangle should not vanish .",
    "remarkably , while many relations , or triangles , similar to eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) can be written or formed , they all have the same area @xmath21 , reflecting the unique cpv phase in the 3 g km model .    for eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) to be _ nontrivial _ , the sides of the triangle should not be colinear .",
    "it was measuring the finite angle between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( the latter defined real in standard@xcite convention ) in 2001 , together with knowledge of the strength of the sides @xmath24 and @xmath23 as well as many other flavor / cpv observables , that confirmed the nontrivial realization of eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) , hence the cpv phase of the km model .      besides the nontrivial realization of eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) , a further subtlety can be inferred from the original km argument : all like - charged quark pairs must be nondegenerate in mass ! otherwise , if their is just one pair of , say @xmath25 and @xmath26 quarks , that are degenerate in mass , then one finds a phase freedom that can absorb the single cpv phase , and effectively one is back to the two generation case with vanishing cpv .    an algebraic construction , known as the jarlskog invariant,@xcite nicely summarizes the nontrivialness of eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) and the nondegeneracy requirement : @xmath27 where @xmath21 is the triangle area as defined before , while the appearance of every ( like - charged ) pair mass difference ensures that @xmath28 would vanish with the degeneracy .",
    "@xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) is not merely a transcription of the wording of previous prerequisites , but has powerful algebraic roots .",
    "it can be derived from @xmath29 $ ] for the case of 3 g .",
    "thus , in terms of the jarlskog invariant , one has    0.2 cm    cpv  _ iff _",
    "@xmath30 .      in his nobel lecture",
    ", kobayashi admitted that ",
    "matter dominance of the universe seems requiring new source of cp violation\",@xcite i.e. beyond the 3 g model he and maskawa presented .",
    "in fact , it is known@xcite that @xmath28 seems short by at least @xmath31 !",
    "let me give@xcite a heuristic , dimensional argument for why this is so .",
    "the issue of bau is not so much the disappearance of antimatter , i.e. the apparent @xmath32 , but that _ some _ , in fact a tiny amount of matter remain ( which contains _ us _ ! ! ) , namely @xmath33 as measured by wmap , which is the @xmath0 quoted earlier in the introduction .",
    "thus , the actual _ asymmetry _ , or bau , is 100% , but the challenge is to explain @xmath34 , and to account for the tiny amount . note that this is a dimensionless number , while @xmath28 of eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) , the source of cpv , carries 12 mass dimensions .",
    "normalizing by @xmath35 tev , the electroweak phase transition temperature ( equivalently one could normalize by the v.e.v . )",
    ", then inserting all quark masses gives @xmath36 , which can now be compared with @xmath37 .",
    "this is the  lore \" that the cpv in km model is too small by at least 10 billion .",
    "further inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) shows that @xmath38 as measured , though small , is not the major culprit .",
    "the real issue is that quark masses ( except @xmath39 ) are too small : the powers of @xmath40 as compared to @xmath41 are just too small !",
    "the way the previous section ended has already planted the seed for the main observation of this section . but let us trace through the way it actually came about . in effect , it arose from broadening of the mind by _ nature _ writing .",
    "experiment is our modern age delphi _ oracle _ , and what it utters sometimes has more than one interpretations .    the thread that lead was the hint , at 2.4@xmath43 level for belle,@xcite that emerged with the 2004 observation of dcpv in @xmath44 : the asymmetry @xmath45 for the analogous charged @xmath46 meson decays seemed different from @xmath47 for neutral @xmath9 meson decays . with similar effect seen by babar , the plenary speaker at ichep 2004 from belle , yoshi sakai , questioned@xcite whether this hinted at large electroweak ( or @xmath48 ) penguin , hence implied new physics .",
    "the point is that a virtual @xmath48 could convert to a @xmath49 , but not a charged pion , hence the @xmath48 penguin contributes to @xmath50 , but is less effective for @xmath51 .",
    "but if @xmath52 is the culprit , then it must arise from new physics , as there is vanishing cpv phase in @xmath53 penguin transitions within sm , as it is governed by @xmath54 , which is effectively real for 3 g .",
    "shocked while writing the first draft of this belle paper  the counterintuitive difference was never predicted  it reminded me of my first b paper,@xcite which was on the related electroweak penguin process @xmath55 ( the @xmath56 takes the place of the @xmath49 ) . prior to that paper ,",
    "@xmath57 power counting had lead people to discard the @xmath48 penguin as compared to the photonic penguin . at @xmath58 order , the former should be small compared with the latter , which is at @xmath59 order .",
    "or so it seems : since @xmath57 has @xmath60 mass dimension , there should be some @xmath61 to make the comparison with the photonic penguin .",
    "one would again dismiss it by taking @xmath62 naively . however , it turns out that @xmath63 , the top quark in the loop that could be heavy .",
    "direct computation showed that for large @xmath39 ( @xmath64 ) , the @xmath55 rate grew almost like @xmath65 , and the heavy quark effect is _ nondecoupled_. we should be familiar with the usual decoupling theorem , where heavy masses are decoupled from scattering amplitudes , such as in qed and qcd , since they only appear in propagators .",
    "however , _ nondecoupling _ appears because yukawa couplings @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the v.e.v .",
    ", appear in the numerator and can counteract the propagator damping .",
    "thus , the nondecoupling phenomena is a _ dynamical _ effect , and is a subtlety of spontaneously broken _ chiral _ gauge theories .",
    "my first b paper turned out to be also my first four generation ( 4 g ) paper , where the nondecoupling effect of 4 g @xmath68 quark could be easily more prominent .",
    "so , i went ahead and demonstrated with two associates the efficacy of the 4 g @xmath68 quark , that it could@xcite drive apart @xmath45 from @xmath47 , for a range of parameters in @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "as a corollary , since the @xmath48 penguin and the box diagram are cousins of each other , the cpv effect of nondecoupling of @xmath68 in @xmath53 @xmath48 penguin should have implications for cpv in the @xmath71@xmath72 mixing via the box diagram , which we will discuss in the next section .      because direct cpv , including the dcpv difference @xmath73 , are simple  bean counts \" , the belle experiment decided to write a paper for the journal _ nature _ to highlight the effect . with even cdf joining the measurement ,",
    "the asymmetry @xmath47 became firmly established around @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , although @xmath45 was not yet firmly established , the unanticipated @xmath75 , measured now by a single experiment ( belle ) to be@xcite @xmath76 with 4.4@xmath43 significance , is _ very large _ : the difference is larger than the already impressively large @xmath77 ( cf .",
    "@xmath78 ) .",
    "although  the oracle spoke \" , the effect put forward by this paper was not widely accepted as indicating new physics . perhaps the particle physics community treat _ nature _ announcements no better than the _ new york times_.",
    "there was also the issue that large @xmath75 could be interpreted as an enhanced color - suppressed tree amplitude @xmath79 that has a considerable strong phase difference with @xmath80 , the regular tree amplitude .",
    "but the actual  _ nature _ writing \" , in  explaining cpv to biologists \" , got me  out of my mind \" , which i turn to in the next subsection .",
    "the heuristic , dimensional analysis argument for why the km mechanism for cpv falls far short of bau makes clear that the culprit is the smallness of lighter quark masses . as we tried to convey to the editor of _ nature _ the relevance of large @xmath75 to readers of their journal , one day late summer 2007 , it occurred to me that , if there is 4 g and one shifts by one generation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) for the jarlskog invariant @xmath28 ( recall that one needs 3 generation for the km mechanism of cpv , hence one is discarding the first generation for a 2 - 3 - 4 world ) , one gets @xmath81 where one sees that , besides @xmath82 , the extreme suppression factor of @xmath83 is replaced by @xmath84 . even for @xmath85",
    "comparable in strength to @xmath21 ( numerical analysis of @xmath75 suggested@xcite a factor of 30 ) , this lead to a gain of @xmath86@xmath87 for @xmath88 over @xmath28 for 3 g , for @xmath89 gev , and clearly removes the verdict that km mechanism for cpv falls far short of observed bau .",
    "the fact that now one seems to have enough cpv within sm , at the cost of 3 g @xmath42 4 g , makes one wonder whether _ mother nature _ might actually use this ? true enough , it was amusing to receive the arxiv number of  .1234 \" , a sure sign of providence , when i posted the paper from a zurich hotel room in march 2008 , before heading for moriond .",
    "but then , a probability of @xmath90 is nothing compared to the gain of a thousand trillion ( @xmath87 ) . as an anecdote",
    ", the paper eventually appeared in the _ chinese journal of physics _ ( published in taiwan ) in 2009 .",
    "the stiffness one faced on 4 g studies were not without reason : the fourth generation had become rather exotic with data from lep . for the detailed early numeric study of 4 g effect on @xmath91 , i was lucky to publish two papers in _ phys .",
    "_ the first one in 2005 may be because it was a timely response to some emergent phenomenon from the b factories .",
    "for the second,@xcite applying pqcd factorization at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , may be due to its sheer technicality ",
    "but one could clearly feel the rehabilitation of 4 g during the year of 2010 , perhaps even becoming a mild fashion .",
    "such was not the situation back in 2007 .",
    "let me use the words of an experimentalist , alison lister@xcite of cdf ( and now atlas ) , at the ichep 2010 conference .",
    "why not four generations ?",
    "there are@xcite two issues :    * @xmath92-width measurement from lep : perfect fit with only three light neutrinos ; * electroweak effects : @xmath93 , @xmath80 fits ( severely ) constrain available 4 g phase space .",
    "for the first , traditional , fourth generation show stopper , lister counters that the true constraint is @xmath94 .",
    "let me add to that , by first changing the notation of the possible new fourth neutral lepton and denote it as @xmath95 , to avoid the connotation of lightness that comes with  @xmath96 \" .",
    "it should be emphasized that , since the discovery of atmospheric neutrino oscillations in 1998,@xcite we know that neutrinos have mass , implying the existence of another mass scale .",
    "this logically refutes the traditional strict interpretation that a fourth light neutrino is excluded by lep data .",
    "it is indeed excluded , but we already know there is new physics in the neutrino or neutral lepton sector .",
    "we then stress that the neutral lepton @xmath95 is very hard to access in the near future at the lhc ( or through neutrino oscillations ) , unless it is of majorana nature with v.e.v .",
    "scale masses .",
    "the second problem of electroweak ( ew ) @xmath93 and @xmath80 constraints are potentially more serious .",
    "but , as pointed out by kribs , plehn , spannowsky and tait in 2007,@xcite these constraints have been over - interpreted ( by pdg ) : 4 g is in fact allowed by ew radiative corrections , and one could even argue that sometimes it gives better agreement together with a _ heavier _ higgs boson . this has been further followed up by chanowitz,@xcite and with the response@xcite from erler and langacker not fully refuting , it is a main cause of the mini - revival of 4 g in the past few years .",
    "there are other reasons for the gradual move to more favorable view ( as compared to the past ) on 4 g , arising from flavor and especially cpv studies of the @xmath72 system .",
    "i am fond of quoting the cdf citation@xcite of myself ",
    "george hou predicted the presence of a @xmath68 quark with mass   to explain the belle results and predicted _ a priori _ the observation of a large @xmath97-violating phase in @xmath98 decays\".the wording  predicted _ a priori _ \" is especially amusing , and should be a reminder to theorists . in any case , this refers to my work on the corollary of large @xmath99 for the @xmath68 quark interpretation of the @xmath75  anomaly \" .",
    "we showed in pqcd at lo in 2005,@xcite then at nlo in 2007,@xcite that 4 g can in principle generate @xmath91 .",
    "the prediction in 2005 was that @xmath99 , defined as the cp phase of the @xmath100 box diagram ( mediating @xmath101 , similarly defined as @xmath102 for @xmath103 ) , would be in the range of @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "this was refined@xcite in 2007 to @xmath106 to @xmath105 after @xmath107 was observed by the cdf experiment in 2006 .",
    "the reason that cdf jovially quoted me in summer 2008 is because three consecutive measurements at the tevatron ( @xmath108 for cdf , and @xmath109 for d@xmath110 ) gave large central values .",
    "the combined significance , however , had dropped to 2.1@xmath43 by summer 2009.@xcite    my 2005 and 2007 studies were based on @xmath111 300 gev . as the mass bounds were rising , i was working with an associate on a 500 gev update .",
    "the experimental developments in 2010 were actually mixed , but also turned up the heat .",
    "first , it was the d@xmath110 announcement@xcite in may of significant @xmath112 ( something akin to the @xmath113 but for the @xmath72 system ) .",
    "this strengthened the indication of deviation from sm ( i.e. 3 g ) .",
    "i had commented,@xcite with an associate , on the previous round of d@xmath110 studies , and had mentioned that 4 g could lead to a sizable @xmath112 . with the new result , which gives the same central value but improves the errors by a factor of two , i did not want to write another paper .",
    "but i placed a comment in a conference talk,@xcite that the new d@xmath110 result , if true , would violate a bound already stressed in ref .",
    ", hence probably suggests hadronically enhanced ( i.e. ope violating ) @xmath114 values . then came the cdf result@xcite on @xmath115 that was less discrepant with sm , implying a smaller value . in the meantime , and prior to the cdf update , i had pointed out@xcite that the expected value for @xmath99 was weaker ( nominally @xmath116 ) for the heavier @xmath117 gev case .",
    "so , the fourth generation  prediction \" is still robust , but would now need lhcb to verify .",
    "it must have been rather sad for the b workers at cdf ( who had remeasured @xmath118 ) when they opened the box for 5.2 fb@xmath119 data .",
    "had the added data firmed up the 20082009 indication , it would allow the possible capture of @xmath99 at the  evidence \" or better level with the full tevatron dataset , hence would have constituted a new physics discovery . with the low central value , and with already half the dataset of run ii used",
    ", there is no hope for any future claim to  evidence \" , and the torch is thereby passed to lhcb .",
    "on the theory front , the papers@xcite by soni and associates , buras and associates , and lenz and associates in the first half of 2010 , together with other studies , clearly ushered in the  4 g rehabilitation \" .",
    "in retrospect , actually much if not most highlights of flavor and cpv physics were learned through the _ nondecoupling _ effect : the gim mechanism , the charm mass , @xmath120 from the @xmath121 box ; heavy top as inferred from large @xmath122 mixing ( @xmath123 box ) , with the consequent cpv phase measurement , and the small @xmath124 due to @xmath125 @xmath92-penguin and @xmath92-penguin enhanced @xmath126 rate . _",
    "all from boxes and @xmath92 penguins ! _",
    "if there is 4 g , we already saw the possible effect on @xmath72 system .",
    "other measurables to watch would be @xmath127 , redux of @xmath128 and @xmath120 , @xmath129 , maybe @xmath130 , and especially @xmath131 ( koto experiment ) .",
    "that is , an agenda for all aspects of flavor physics and cp violation , all as a consequence of large yukawa couplings !    but , nothing can replace direct search for the 4 g @xmath68 and @xmath132 quarks , and we are on the verge of transit from the tevatron to the lhc era .",
    "the pursuit at the tevatron has been vigorous , with the mass bound ever rising .",
    "the current cdf limit is@xcite @xmath133 based on 4.6 fb@xmath119 data . but a persistent irritation since earlier analyses with smaller datasets , is the weakening of the bound from what was expected , due to excess events at high @xmath134 ( reconstructed mass ) and @xmath135 ( a scalar sum of transverse energies ) . with d@xmath110 now observing something similar@xcite but giving a weaker bound , it is not clear whether the excess events are due to common misunderstanding of background , or something genuine",
    ". cdf has pursued the much cleaner signature of same - sign dileptons via @xmath136 pair production , followed by @xmath137 decay , reaching mass bounds similar@xcite to eq .",

    "the bound on 4 g masses at lhc would reach beyond 500 gev,@xcite which is roughly the unitarity bound@xcite where _ perturbative _ partial wave unitarity , or probability conservation , breaks down .",
    "how does one continue the pursuit ?",
    "with the available energy at the lhc , clearly one should not stop searching at 500 gev . besides the need for theoretical guidance for continued search , precisely because perturbation theory would breakdown ,",
    "one comes face to face with some rather interesting issues related to _ strong _",
    "yukawa couplings , the origin of the aforementioned nondecoupling .",
    "the most tantalizing conjecture is : 0.15 cm    0.1 cm a conjecture , traced to nambu ( the recipient of the other half of 2008 nobel prize ) , is that perhaps @xmath139 could develop a v.e.v .",
    ", i.e. condense , by large yukawa coupling ! ( ? ) to seriously address these issues , one needs a nonperturbative platform of study , and the only one we know , is on the lattice .",
    "a study of the strong higgs - yukawa sector on the lattice has therefore been initiated .      without further ado ,",
    "let me outline an approved five - year ( starting august 2010 ) research program , what i dubbed the  * 3 * + * i * \" approach under the title of  beyond kobayashi - maskawa  towards discovery of 4th generation quarks at the lhc \" .",
    "the  * 3 * \" is a three - pronged approach to the associated physics .",
    "naturally , there is the direct search with the cms detector .",
    "we have also purposefully built up a new theory group , both for the lhc era in general , and to provide phenomenology support for the experimental effort .",
    "the third arm is a consortium of taiwan and desy - zeuthen on the aforementioned strong higgs - yukawa on the lattice .",
    "note that results from the lattice study would become desperately needed to pursue beyond the expected 2011 data , which would touch and could reach beyond the unitarity bound .",
    "this approved five - year project has loftier experimental goals : to uplift the past platform into the full , long term run plan of the lhc .",
    "as such , one needed to expand beyond the taiwan cms contribution to the preshower subdetector during the past decade .",
    "we were lucky to become part of the cern / taiwan center , one of the three ( the other two are psi / ethz and desy / aachen / karlsruhe ) centers for module production for the cms pixel upgrade phase i , targeted for completion in 2016 . such ",
    "deeper \" involvement within cms longer term hardware effort will certainly assure our longer term physics program .",
    "the most important point of this talk is eq .",

    "that is one advantage of 4 g vs. other new physics scenarios ( e.g. related to bau ) . and",

    "_ cures this perturbative malady may shed light on the source of electroweak symmetry breaking , and the existence and nature of the higgs boson .",

    "composite higgs , which has not been seriously studied for phase transitions at finite temperature , would change the scenario .",
