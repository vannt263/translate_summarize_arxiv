    "on - going accretion is also direct evidence of the presence of gaseous circumstellar disc material close to the star and therefore the time dependence of the mass accretion rate ( @xmath5 ) traces disc evolution .",

    "the large scatter in the data does not allow an accurate constraint on the form of this relation , which is commonly assumed to be a power law : @xmath8 measurements in a number of nearby star forming regions generally find @xmath9-@xmath10 and @xmath11@xmath12 @xcite . in the orion nebula cluster ( onc )",
    "@xcite found a typical trend for the entire stellar sample ( @xmath3 ) , from a uniquely large sample of precise @xmath0 estimates ( over 700 sources ) .",
    "these measurements were derived combining hubble space telescope photometry of stellar flux excesses with the available spectroscopically determined stellar photospheric parameters in the onc from @xcite . despite the typical value of @xmath2 for the overall population , @xcite also found that stars of about a solar mass showed a systematic slower decay of accretion , with @xmath13 .",

    "in this paper we focus on the biases in the measured correlations between @xmath0 and stellar age , and the estimated accretion timescales . in what follows we will characterize this bias by comparing the true value of @xmath2 in equation  [ equation : mdot_propto ] , which we refer to as @xmath17 , with that obtained from fitting the @xmath0 versus @xmath18 relationship to observational or simulated data , which we refer to as @xmath19 . in section [ section : the_problem ]",
    "we introduce the major underlying problems with measuring @xmath0 , stellar parameters , and thus @xmath2 ; in section [ section : simulations ] we set out our modelling approach and the underlying assumptions . in section [ section : results ] we present the results of simulations to study the systematic biases in @xmath2 introduced by a combination of uncertainties and selection effects .",
    "a more detailed individual treatment of each of these effects is presented in appendices [ appendix : simulations_simplespreads ] and [ section : selection_effects ] .",
    "finally we discuss implications and caveats of our findings ( section [ section : discussion ] ) and summarize ( section [ section : summary ] ) our conclusions .",
    "the stellar parameters of young stars usually can not be assigned with good accuracy , due to both observational uncertainties and the physical nature of pms stars ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "young clusters are often partially embedded in their parental clouds , causing differential extinction between their members ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 must be estimated for individual stars based on either spectroscopic or photometric techniques .",
    "pms stars are also known to exhibit substantial variability @xcite , due to rotation of heavily spotted photospheres and non steady accretion .",
    "moreover , the continuum emission produced by accretion is often not properly characterized @xcite and it may present peculiar spectral energy distributions @xcite .",
    "unresolved stellar multiplicity also biases the observed luminosities and inferred ages @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the history of protostellar accretion is thought to influence the subsequent stellar structure for the first few myrs of pms evolution @xcite .",
    "if different stars of a population undergo a diversity of protostellar buildup histories during the embedded phase ( intensity of accretion bursts , different initial conditions ) , this can result in a significant luminosity spread even for coeval stars .",
    "the effect is most prominent for `` cold '' protostellar accretion - when little or no energy from the accretion flow is stored in the stellar interiors , and may result in systematically smaller radii and lower luminosities for stars of @xmath22 even several myr after they emerge as t - tauri stars @xcite .",
    "stellar radii may also expand in response to `` hot '' protostellar accretion , but the contraction timescales will then be so short ( @xmath23  myr ) that such objects are unlikely to contribute significantly to the luminosity spread seen in a population of pms objects .    whereas both stellar masses and ages are uncertain due to these issues , ages are far more problematic : first , protostellar accretion produces spreads mostly in @xmath24 , which correlates with @xmath6 and biases @xmath7 only marginally ; second , the typical range of masses observed in pms clusters is large ( @xmath25  dex ) , and much larger than the uncertainties on this quantity .    all these effects broaden the measured age distribution in young clusters and lead to overestimates of the real intrinsic age spread",
    "the actual extent of this effect is partially unknown , but some studies carried out in the onc , have tried to constrain it .",
    "the population of the onc , when stars are carefully positioned in the hrd using spectroscopic spectral types complemented with photometry to disentangle dust extinction for individual sources , shows an isochronal spread in log age of @xmath26  dex around a mean , model dependent , age of @xmath27  myr @xcite .",
    "independent studies based on the analysis of uncertainties @xcite and projected stellar radii @xcite indicate that most of the luminosity spread must be attributed to a spread in stellar radii , and the observational uncertainties have a marginal role , accounting for an apparent age spread of only @xmath28 .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite points out that not all the spread in radii can be attributed to an intrinsic age spread , since an expected correlation between isochronal ages and disk fractions is not observed . through statistical simulations",
    ", they estimate an upper limit on the real age spread in the onc @xmath29  dex .",
    "this result , combined with evidence for a true spread in radii and the small impact of observational uncertainties , suggests that a `` non negligible '' luminosity spread may be induced by protostellar accretion histories .",
    "based only on spatial and kinematic considerations , a real age spread must exist at some level ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and extreme perturbations in the hrd due to protostellar accretion histories are not supported by measurements of lithium depletion @xcite .      the gravitational energy released by infalling material produces a characteristic flux excess over that expected from the stellar photosphere @xcite .",
    "this comprises a strong uv excess produced by the shock at the photosphere , wide optically thin recombination lines from the infalling column , and optical continuum from the heated photosphere , often referred to as veiling .",
    "practically , the bolometric accretion luminosity @xmath30 is estimated by measuring the intensity of a portion of the excess emission , usually hydrogen ricombination lines  especially h@xmath31 in the optical or the balmer jump excess in the @xmath32-band , from either spectroscopy @xcite or photometry @xcite .",
    "practically , the measurement @xmath30 is some cases imprecise .",
    "separating @xmath30 from the total stellar flux requires a good knowledge of the photospheric flux , but this is often imperfect ( see section [ section : the_problem_age ] ) . in reality , the system of star , disk and accretion have a more complex interplay between the radiative and hydrodynamical aspects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , the bolometric @xmath30 is extrapolated from portions of its continuum or line emission based on empirical relations @xcite , which are affected by a significant dispersion , and in some cases the spectrum of accretion excess can present large anomalies @xcite .    even when the measurements of @xmath30 are precise , their conversion into mass accretion rates requires additional assumptions . since @xmath30 originates from the release of gravitational energy , @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath7 are the stellar radius , luminosity and mass , and @xmath36 the inner disk radius .",
    "thus , since it is commonly assumed @xmath37 : @xmath38    in reality @xmath39 is probably closer to the co - rotation radius @xcite , which varies star by star as the typical pms rotation periods @xmath40 range from less than a day to @xmath41 days .",
    "this produces uncertainties of a factor 2 or more in estimates of @xmath5 .",
    "fortunately , the uncertainties in estimates of @xmath0 should be a minor cause of bias in @xmath2 compared to uncertainties in the stellar parameters ( section [ section : the_problem_age ] and [ section : the_problem_correlated_uncertainties ] ) .",
    "first , estimates of @xmath2 are generally based on a large number of sources .",
    "for example , the work of @xcite determined @xmath0 in the onc for over 700 sources , using hst photometry to measure both h@xmath31 and @xmath32-band excess .",
    "the large number statistics mitigate against the inevitable presence of peculiar sources departing from the assumptions of equation [ equation : mdot1 ] , ( although this does not preclude systematic problems with this equation ) .",
    "second , in the majority of the studies cited in section  [ section : intro ] , @xmath0 , and hence @xmath2 , was estimated for sources whose stellar parameters have been assigned from spectroscopy ; thus large anti - correlations between @xmath35 and @xmath30 from a lack of knowledge on what fraction of the photospheric flux is to be attributed to accretion should not be present .",
    "if the errors in @xmath0 are symmetric and independent of the stellar parameters , which is largely the case for several of the issues described above , only a vertical scatter is introduced in the measured @xmath42@xmath6 relation , with no effect on @xmath2 .",
    "however , equation [ equation : mdot1 ] shows that @xmath0 is strongly dependent on the assigned stellar parameters @xmath34,@xmath35 and @xmath7 . since , at a given @xmath20 , @xmath43 , equation [ equation : mdot2 ] implies that @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , for low - mass pms stars stellar evolutionary models predict that @xmath45 , and thus : @xmath46 during the pms contraction towards the main sequence , @xmath35 decreases roughly as @xmath47 , while @xmath7 depends on both @xmath35 and @xmath20 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath35 or @xmath20 are uncertain , the consequent errors in age and mass will correlate with those in @xmath0 .",
    "the bias in @xmath0 for a given star depends on the actual interplay between uncertainties in stellar parameters and in @xmath30 , which is in turn dictated by the physical or observational effects altering the estimate of these quantities , and can vary from star to star .",
    "we can however treat this problem in a simplified way and describe 3 limiting cases :    * * _ type a _ * : the ratio @xmath48 is not affected by the uncertainty in the stellar parameters .",
    "this assumption is adequate for a number of scenarios where the presence of an error in the estimated stellar luminosity affects @xmath30 in the same way ; e.g. : 1 ) wrong or uncertain distance to a particular source ; 2 ) when a fraction of the stellar light is blocked , by , e.g , a circumstellar disk seen nearly edge - on ; 3 ) when @xmath20 is correctly estimated , but the extinction in the band used to obtain @xmath35 is incorrect because of a peculiar reddening law ; 4 ) in the case of unresolved binarity and both components are ( equally ) accreting .",
    "also dust extinction does not significantly affect the ratio @xmath48 , especially if @xmath0 is measured from the @xmath49 excess @xcite .",
    "+ from equation [ equation : mdot2 ] we then have : @xmath50 * * _ type b _ * : the accretion luminosity @xmath30 is correctly measured , even if the @xmath35 is wrong .",
    "this is the case for errors in the stellar luminosity such as : 1 ) rotational variability due to dark spots ; 2 ) incorrect accounting for optical continuum excess ( veiling ) , 3 ) unresolved multiplicity with only one companion responsible for the measured @xmath30 . from equation [ equation : mdot1 ]",
    "we have : @xmath51 * * _ type c _ * : a variety of protostellar accretion histories @xcite produces a range of possible @xmath34 for the same @xmath7 and age , leading to an observed luminosity spread .",
    "here we assume that @xmath20 is unperturbed .",
    "unlike types a and b , this is not an error in the position of the star in the hrd , as @xmath20 , @xmath35 , @xmath34 are correctly determined ; rather , @xmath52 and @xmath7 are wrong , since they are assigned using a unique , incorrect grid of evolutionary models with a single birthline .",
    "thus , the biased estimate of mass accretion rates will be : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mass assigned to the new position in the hrd using non - accreting isochrones .",
    "in reality , when a real stellar population is considered , the overall effect of uncertainties will be due to a combination of biases of types a , b and c. in principle , following the definition of the type a and b biases , an additional type of uncertainty is present ; this is when @xmath35 is correct but @xmath30 is not .",
    "this scenario , which encompasses most of the difficulties with the measurement of @xmath30 we discussed in section [ section : the_problem_mdot ] , is however irrelevant for our analysis : if the photospheric parameters are not perturbed , the ages are unaffected , and the result is a vertical ( i.e. uncorrelated ) spread in the @xmath42 versus @xmath6 plane , which does not alter @xmath19 .",
    "this will occur when @xmath30 uncertainties are uncorrelated with the stellar parameters ; for instance , where the `` non universality ''  or contamination  of the accretion spectrum @xcite or the temporal variability of @xmath0 alter the estimated @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : hrd_example ] illustrates an example of how uncertain stellar parameters bias the measured @xmath0@xmath6 correlation .",
    "we consider 3 stars on a 3  myr @xcite isochrone , with masses @xmath55 , 1 and 2.5  m@xmath15 , and assign them an arbitrary value of @xmath56 in units of @xmath57yr@xmath58 .",
    "we then perturb @xmath20 and @xmath24 , shifting their values along circles in the hrd , mimicking the effect of an uncertainty of 0.2  dex in @xmath24 and 0.02  dex in @xmath59 . for each of these points",
    ", we re - assign @xmath7 and @xmath6 by isochrone interpolation , and derive the correction to @xmath0 due to the resulting change in the stellar parameters @xmath60 from equation [ equation : mdot2 ] , assuming a bias of either type a or b. the result shows the highly correlated shifts in @xmath18 and @xmath42 produced by errors in @xmath59 and @xmath24 , with a slope ( on logarithmic axes ) ranging from 0 to @xmath61 .",
    "the examples shown in figure [ fig : hrd_example ] suggest that when an entire stellar population is considered , the data in the @xmath42@xmath18 plane are shifted by uncertainties along some preferential direction , affecting the measured slope @xmath19 and introducing an apparent correlation between these two quantities even in the limiting case of a coeval population .",
    "since , as we discussed earlier , uncertainties in the isochronal ages in young clusters are large , perhaps accounting for half or more of the width of the apparent age distribution , this bias in @xmath2 may be significant .",
    "also , given that ages are generally placed on the @xmath62-axis to determine @xmath2 from the @xmath42@xmath18 plane , regression dilution ( @xcite ) becomes important .",
    "this is a general phenomenon affecting linear regression and a consequence of it being a non symmetric approach in the two variables .",
    "statistical variability , measurement error or random noise in the @xmath63 variable cause uncertainty in the estimated slope , but not bias ; on the other hand any noise , errors or scatter in the independent variable @xmath62 does bias the estimated slope , and the greater the variance in the @xmath62 measurement ( our stellar age ) , the closer the estimated slope ( our @xmath19 ) approaches zero instead of the true value .",
    "this bias could in principle be removed , but only if error bars in both axes are well known and accounted for when fitting the data .",
    "this is not generally performed for stellar ages .    in the analysis of this paper ( see section [ section : results ] ) we will assume that the bias in @xmath0 affecting @xmath2 originates from the errors in the stellar parameters , and that any uncertainty from the @xmath30 estimate is independent of the stellar parameters .",
    "however , in some cases the interplay between the uncertainties is more complex and may produce additional biases in @xmath2 . when the data are insufficient to properly separate the photospheric and accretion contribution to the total flux ",
    "e.g. , when results are based solely on broad - band photometry , and for intrinsically faint sources like brown dwarfs ",
    "an underestimate of @xmath30 leads to an overestimate of the stellar @xmath20 and @xmath35 , with a consequent simultaneous error in both age and @xmath64 @xcite . additionally , as stellar rotation periods in young stars vary with isochronal age @xcite , some correlation between age and inner ( co - rotation ) disk radius may be present , introducing an age - dependent variation of the term @xmath65 in equation [ equation : mdot1 ] . similarly",
    ", stellar rotation in young clusters often appears slower for disk - bearing stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the presence of disks is both directly related to the accretion process , and a contributor to the assignment of inaccurate stellar parameters @xcite .",
    "all of these factors are yet to be sufficiently characterized or understood well enough to study their possible biasing impact on the measured time decay of @xmath0 . because of this , and as in this work we aim to look for systematic biases in the published values of @xmath19 , which usually assume equations [ equation : mdot_propto ] and [ equation : mdot1 ] , we will focus on the bias produced by uncertain stellar parameters , and leave additional comments addressing the possiblity of other effects to the discussion in section [ section : discussion ] .",
    "selection effects due to accretion detection thresholds may also bias @xmath19 .",
    "small @xmath0 is detected more easily in faint stars than in bright stars , since the contrast , @xmath48 , is larger .",
    "this issue has been pointed out as critical , especially for measuring the mass dependence of @xmath0 through the parameter @xmath66 in equation  [ equation : mdot_propto ] @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath0@xmath6 correlation is also affected since @xmath35 decreases with apparent age . alternatively , if the stellar sample is incomplete at faint luminosities , older stars with small @xmath0 could be systematically missed .    a flat detection limit in stellar luminosity ( or magnitude ) and a uniform threshold in the quantity used to determine accretion excess ( e.g. , h@xmath31 equivalent width , or @xmath67 band excess in magnitudes ) will result in an inclined detection threshold in the @xmath68@xmath6 plane , skewing the relationship between these quantities deduced from samples with detected accretion .",
    "this type of selection effect is dominant in studies of distant clusters ( e.g. , the magellanic clouds , or extincted galactic clusters ) , where sources can not be detected in the very low - mass range , and in older @xmath69  myr clusters , where the fraction of sources with detectable mass accretion is minimal .",
    "we perform simulations of synthetic populations in the hrd to characterize the biases in the measured exponent @xmath19 , due to inaccurate assignment of stellar parameters and selection effects .",
    "the general method is straightforward : we generate a large set of pms stars assuming an age distribution ; we assign values of @xmath70 to each star according to an assumed value of @xmath71 and @xmath66 .",
    "then we displace the sources in the hrd mimicking the effect of different types of uncertainties . for each source ,",
    "its perturbed position in the hrd results in the assignment of a new measured age from isochrone interpolation , as well as a new measured @xmath0 using the perturbed stellar parameters , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath7 , in equation [ equation : mdot2 ] ) .",
    "lastly , @xmath19 is found by linear regression and compared to the assumed @xmath17 .      throughout our simulations ,",
    "we assume a cluster population with a mean age of 2.5  myr , similar to that of the onc when @xcite isochrones are used to assign ages @xcite .",
    "in fact the absolute age of orion , as that of any young cluster , is uncertain by a factor of several and model dependent .",
    "however , the onc has a relative age comparable , within a factor of 2 , to the majority of star forming regions where accretion timescales are studied .",
    "our assumed mean cluster age of 2.5  myr is purely dictated by our intention to generate an observed hrd comparable with the onc , since we will adopt @xcite models , but its absolute value has little to do with the phenomena we aim to study . since pms isochrones in the hrd are almost parallel and spaced by nearly identical offsets in @xmath18 , changing the mean age for a population produces mostly a horizontal shift in the @xmath0@xmath6 plane with little effect on @xmath19 . in section",
    "[ appendix : evolmodels ] we demonstrate this , and show that the behavior of the bias in @xmath2 remains nearly identical if another set of evolutionary models with a large difference in predicted absolute age scale is adopted instead of the @xcite isochrones .",
    "although @xmath19 is insensitive to changes in the absolute age scale , the measured accretion timescale @xmath72 is proportional to the absolute age of the system .",
    "this is a general problem for the study of young cluster evolution , with consequences extending far beyond the scope of this paper @xcite .    in several parts of this work ,",
    "e.g. , when studying the effect of luminosity spreads alone ( appendix [ section : simulations - simplespread ] ) , and when multiple combined uncertainties are considered ( section [ section : combined effects ] ) , the apparent broadening of the hrd is tuned to reproduce the apparent age spread @xmath73 observed in the onc , as well as its observed mean age , and the value of @xmath19 in the region .",
    "none of these quantities are peculiar to the onc , and other galactic star forming regions share similar values , so our treatment and results should be of general applicability .",
    "we assume that the observed spreads in apparent age are produced by a combination of a real age spread and spreads due to observational uncertainties that are formed by displacing sources in the hrd along the @xmath24 axis , the @xmath59 axis , and along both axes due to uncertain @xmath21 .",
    "we let the real spread in log age range between @xmath74  dex and 0.3  dex , tuning the observational uncertainties to produce the observed apparent log age spread of 0.4  dex .",
    "this leaves open the possibilities that the additional spread in apparent age , beyond that attributable to the _ known _ observational uncertainties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is due to ( a ) physical effects that lead to different hrd positions for stars of the same age ( e.g. the protostellar accretion history ) or ( b ) further unrecognised sources of uncertainty in @xmath35 and @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "lastly , we initially assume that @xmath0 depends solely on the stellar mass and age through equation  [ equation : mdot_propto ] . as anticipated in section [ section : the_problem_correlated_uncertainties ] , other physical and observational effects may add further complications if the error in deriving @xmath30 has some correlation with the assigned stellar parameters .",
    "however , we deliberately base our work on the onc to mitigate such scenarios .",
    "the onc , is perhaps the most extensively studied young cluster , where stellar parameters and accretion luminosities have been assigned with the highest achievable precision and completeness , and are subject to the minimum of observational bias . in section [ section : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the implications of relaxing this assumption .",
    "we generate 50,000 random stars with ages drawn from the assumed age distribution and masses drawn from the @xcite initial mass function .",
    "we then assign their @xmath20 , @xmath35 , @xmath34 by interpolation of the @xcite evolutionary models .",
    "the assigned @xmath0 , following a chosen @xmath17 ( generally between 0 and 4 ) and @xmath66 ( generally either 0 and 2 ) , requires an arbitrary normalization : we impose @xmath56 for @xmath75  m@xmath15 and @xmath76  myr . a different normalization would only produce a rigid vertical shift in the @xmath42@xmath18 plane , with no effect on @xmath19    we then randomly displace the positions of these sources in the hrd to reproduce the effect of a given observational uncertainty ( e.g. , an assumed apparent luminosity spread , or a differential extinction ) , or physical mechanism ( e.g. , a distribution of @xmath34 from protostellar accretion history ) . in any case , the resulting ( broader ) hrd represents the observed one , thus , for each star , the measured stellar parameters ( @xmath54 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) , altered from the true ones , are assigned by interpolation of the siess evolutionary models in the perturbed hrd . as for the measured value of @xmath0 for each source ( see equation [ equation : mdot1 ] ) , the way it changes compared to the true value assigned to each star depends on the nature of the particular uncertainties affecting the stellar parameters , and is computed from equations [ equation : typea ] , [ equation : typeb ] and [ equation : typec ] .",

    "@xcite showed that only @xmath92  dex of the 0.4  dex apparent age spread could be explained with observational uncertainties of types a or b. the rest ( about 80% ) we choose to attribute to protostellar accretion histories , a case c uncertainty .",
    "our assumed combination of the 3 cases has only a minor effect on the result .",
    "as we show in appendix [ appendix : simulations_simplespreads ] , the three uncertanty types produce similar biases in @xmath19 , differing only by systematic offets of a few tenths .",
    "lastly , in a separate set of simulations , we also include a correction to the isochrones to remove the small mass - age correlation introduced by using the siess models to interpret the observed hrd ( see appendix [ section : acchistory ] ) , as this turns out to have a far larger effect on @xmath2 than even the adoption of a different family of evolutionary models ( appendix [ appendix : evolmodels ] ) . when the siess isochrones ( and most of other evolutionary models ) are used to assign stellar parameters , intermediate mass stars appear older , on average , than low mass stars .",
    "we make the assumption that this is a systematic error and tilt the simulated , broadened population in the hrd by the amount that would remove any correlation between mass and age in the observed onc population .",
    "equation [ equation : typec ] is then used to calculate a new @xmath0 from the resulting perturbed measured stellar parameters .",
    "results comparing the recovered @xmath19 versus the input @xmath17 are shown in figure [ fig : tautau_lumi_teff_underl ] , separating the assumptions of an uncertainty in @xmath20 or of differential @xmath21 , and including or not the correction of the isochrones for the mass - age correlation .",
    "each simulation is performed for two input mass dependences of @xmath0 : @xmath81 ( no mass dependence ) and @xmath93 ( large mass dependence ) .",
    "results are presented for the entire mass range and also for three subsets of @xmath7 .",
    "we find that @xmath94 and that when considering only the @xmath20 or @xmath21 uncertainties ( upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : tautau_lumi_teff_underl ] ) , this bias is not sensitive to @xmath66 and only weakly dependent on stellar mass .",
    "thus , for the level of uncertainties we have assumed , a value of @xmath95 that is typically found in the onc and other young galactic clusters ( see section [ section : intro ] ) can only be reproduced if @xmath96 , which indicates a much faster decay of @xmath0 than commonly assumed .",
    "it is noteworthy that the simulations with spreads in @xmath20 or @xmath21 _ and _ @xmath24 ( upper panels of figure [ fig : tautau_lumi_teff_underl ] ) yield a similar bias to those found from simulations with only a luminosity spread of the same total extent ( see figure [ fig : simplespread_tautau02 ] in appendix  a ) .",
    "the reason for this is presumably that uncertainties in @xmath20 or @xmath21 at the level we have assumed do not lead to @xmath24 errors that contribute in a significant way to the observed @xmath24 dispersion , which is therefore dominated by the additional uncertainty in @xmath24 that we have inserted in the simulations .",
    "when we correct the isochrones to eliminate a possible mass - age correlation in intermediate mass stars ( see section  [ section : acchistory ] ) , the bias in @xmath2 remains similar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tautau_lumi_teff_underl ] , bottom panels ) .",
    "however , the small mass dependence seen in the upper panels is completely removed .",
    "this phenomenon is a coincidence , but simplifies any quantitative estimate of the bias in @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand the bias does now depend on @xmath66 , getting stronger as @xmath66 increases .",
    "we have performed similar simulations changing the assumed real age spread between @xmath97  dex .",
    "we have considered the same uncertainties in @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but varied those in @xmath24 in order to reach the same total apparent age spread @xmath73 .",
    "as before , we find the results almost indistinguishable from those derived in appendix [ section : simulations - simplespread - varyingspread ] when considering solely the effect of a luminosity spread ; the bias in @xmath2 is very sensitive to the balance between any real age spread and the apparent age spread due to uncertainties in @xmath24 .",
    "our results predict that the bias in @xmath2 varies from @xmath98 for @xmath74  dex , to @xmath99 for @xmath100  dex .",
    "as anticipated , observations in a number of regions have shown systematically lower values of @xmath19 ( @xmath101 ) when the stellar samples are restricted to the solar - mass range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our simulations accounting for all uncertainties ( figure [ fig : tautau_lumi_teff_underl ] bottom panels ) on the other hand predict a mass - independent bias in @xmath2 , so that a slower decay of @xmath0 for intermediate masses compared to low - mass stars may be genuine .",
    "however , our modelling assumes uniform uncertainties at all masses and this may not be realistic .",
    "observations often show systematically larger apparent age spreads for solar - type stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could indicate that this mass range is more affected by uncertainties , thus experiencing a larger bias in @xmath2 .",
    "luminosity spreads caused by accretion history may also be more important for solar - mass objects @xcite and since this type c uncertainty produces the largest bias ( see appendix [ section : simulations - simplespread - onc ] ) , a smaller @xmath102 might be found for intermediate - mass objects even if @xmath17 is mass - independent .",
    "we now add selection effects due to detection incompleteness to our simulations .",
    "a full description of the origin of the bias in @xmath2 due to this effect alone is given in appendix [ section : selection_effects ] .",
    "we first run a synthetic population simulation as in section [ section : combined effects ] , assuming an intrinsic age spread @xmath79 and the same combination of uncertainties to reach a total apparent age spread @xmath103 .",
    "for simplicity , since the effects of uncertainties in @xmath20 and @xmath21 produced similar effects , we only include the @xmath20 uncertainty .",
    "the simulations include a correction to the isochrones that removes the apparent correlation between mass and age .",
    "starting from the resulting _ observed _ @xmath20 and @xmath24 , we introduce sample incompleteness following the same method as in appendix [ section : selection_effects ] .",
    "this assumes that @xmath0 is derived from h@xmath31 photometry , which has a parameterized detection limit and photometric error distribution .",
    "simulated sources that are a ) fainter than the detection limit , or b ) have h@xmath31 excess smaller than the photometric uncertainties , are removed from the sample and excluded from the fit in the @xmath0-@xmath6 plane used to derive @xmath19 .",
    "two detection limits are simulated : one relatively deep ( @xmath104 ) and one shallow ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "we only consider one value for the mass dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath0 in the synthetic population modelling ( see section [ section : simulation_howtheywork ] ) leads to different fractions of excluded sources for different values of @xmath66 at a given detection limit .",
    "this would provide an inconsistent comparison of results for the same @xmath17 .",
    "instead we consider only @xmath106 , which is intermediate to the cases studied in the last section . as in appendix",
    "[ section : selection_effects ] , we introduce an additional dispersion of 0.65  dex in the individual values of @xmath0 , which represents star - to - star variations of accretion at a given mass and age . this value has been tailored so that , after the addition of observational uncertainties and the mass dependence of @xmath68 , the overall dispersion from the fitted power law in the @xmath0@xmath6 plane is 0.85  dex , as found in the onc @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : tautau_lumi_teff_underl_seleffects ] compares @xmath102 and @xmath17 for these scenarios . by comparing these plots with those without the inclusion of selection effects ( figure [ fig : tautau_lumi_teff_underl ] )",
    "it appears that incompleteness further displaces the @xmath19 towards unity .",
    "this is because the photometric detection threshold in the @xmath107@xmath18 plane is generally inclined with a ( negative ) slope @xmath108 ( see appendix [ section : selection_effects ] ) and @xmath19 is biased towards larger values if the real @xmath109 , and towards smaller values if @xmath110 . the typical measured values @xmath111 ( in the onc and elsewhere ) would require @xmath112 .",
    "however the comparison between figure [ fig : tautau_lumi_teff_underl_seleffects ] and figure [ fig : tautau_lumi_teff_underl ] also shows that this latter result is still dominated by the bias caused by uncertainties in the stellar parameters alone ( figure [ fig : tautau_lumi_teff_underl ] ) and hence by the extent of the real age spread  @xmath86 in this case .",
    "we have also checked the behavior of the results starting from a smaller or larger @xmath113 . as we found in appendix",
    "[ section : simulations - simplespread - varyingspread ] , a smaller @xmath113 leads to larger @xmath114 and vice - versa .",
    "our modeling has shown that uncertainties in the parameters of pms stars and sample incompleteness strongly bias the measured correlation between accretion and age , parameterised as @xmath115 , leading to smaller values of @xmath102 or equivalently , overestimated accretion timescales .",
    "the size of the bias in @xmath2 depends chiefly on the extent to which the apparent age spread in a region / cluster is explained by a real age spread within the region rather than various observational uncertainties and physical mechanisms that broaden the luminosity distribution in the hrd .",
    "this has two general implications :    1 .",
    "the real decay of mass accretion is faster than that inferred from any measured correlation between @xmath0 and isochronal ages . 2 .",
    "if @xmath17 is constrained , either on a theoretical basis , or from observational evidence that is not based on isochronal ages in a single cluster ( e.g. , from the measurement of the mean @xmath0 or the fraction of accretors in clusters of different mean age ) , then comparison between @xmath17 and @xmath19 places a constraint on the real age spread in a cluster .    we have shown that assuming a real age spread @xmath116  dex combined with luminosity uncertainties , which yield a total apparent age spread of 0.4  dex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leads to @xmath117 .",
    "this indicates that the decay of @xmath0 is @xmath118 times faster than that inferred from a simple fit of observed @xmath0 versus isochronal ages .",
    "such observations generally suggest @xmath119@xmath10 and hence @xmath120 .",
    "this implies an accretion timescale ( @xmath121  myr ) , shorter than that inferred from the measured fraction of accreting sources in clusters of different age ( @xmath122  myr , @xcite ) .",
    "this interpretation however is not without caveats : first , precise comparison of these methods is not straightforward ; the fraction of accretors is defined above a given threshold ( e.g. , in @xcite @xmath123  m@xmath15yr@xmath58 ) , and when this fraction is small , at cluster ages of 510  myr , it carries little information about the _",
    "average _ values of @xmath0 in the entire population .",
    "second , whereas @xmath2 is weakly affected by the absolute age scale ( see section [ section : simulations ] and appendix [ appendix : evolmodels ] )  which is highly dependent on the evolutionary models one adopts ",
    "@xmath124 is proportional to the assumed mean cluster age .",
    "still , if the current age scales were systematically wrong @xcite , both disk and accretion lifetimes would have to be corrected in a similar way @xcite .",
    "if observational and physical uncertainties dominate the luminosity spread observed in young clusters , such that the real ( gaussian ) dispersion in @xmath125 age is smaller than 0.2  dex , then or simulations show that @xmath17 would need to be even larger ( @xmath126 ) to reproduce the observed @xmath42 vs @xmath18 relationship .",
    "such a rapid , almost instantaneous , decay of @xmath127 would be incompatible with both observational evidence and the theory of disc evolution .",
    "if accretion ceased this rapidly within the first myrs of evolution , clusters of older mean age ( @xmath41  myr ) should not host @xmath128 accreting stars , but a small fraction of accreting older stars are observed in such clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , @xmath129 implies a decrease of the average @xmath0 of more than 2 orders of magnitude between 1 and 3  myr , and clusters with mean ages in this age range do not exhibit systematic differences in their average accretion rates to this extent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these observations together suggest that a very fast cluster formation scenario producing a real age spread @xmath130  dex is not favoured .    on the other hand , if most of the observed spread in age were real ( more than 0.2  dex dispersion in log age ) , the bias in @xmath2 is smaller , allowing longer accretion timescales .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile this , at least in the case of the onc , with the lack of correlation between disc fractions and isochronal ages @xcite .",
    "thus it appears most likely that the spread in log age for the onc should not be far from 0.2  dex to satisfy these constraints . assuming a mean age for the onc of 2.5  myr and a lognormal age distribution ,",
    "this implies that 95% of stars were born between 1.3 and 4  myr ago .",
    "this is of order 5 - 10 crossing times in the region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicative of a relatively slow star formation process .",
    "considering therefore @xmath86 , and the typical values of @xmath19 , our simulations suggest @xmath131 .",
    "the fast decay of @xmath0 implied by our results is not predicted by models that assume viscous disk evolution , ( @xmath132 , * ? ? ?",
    "this indicates that other factors such as photoevaporation and high energy photons from the central star @xcite or planet formation may either accelerate the clearing of material in the inner disk during the first few myrs of pms evolution , or inhibit its accretion onto the stellar surface .",
    "the measured fraction of sources showing warm dust emission excess ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) in different young clusters may point to longer timescales for inner disk dissipation than the accretion timescale our finding suggest .",
    "there is also observational evidence for fast inside - out dispersal @xcite , which supports the notion that the accretion timescales is shorter than the disk dispersal timescale .",
    "our analysis shows that the apparent flattening in @xmath2 is driven mainly by the fraction of the observed age spread that can be attributed to luminosity dispersion caused by either observational or physical uncertainties .",
    "the simplest solution to mitigate the requirement for a very fast decay of @xmath0 is to allow this fraction to be small and hence a large real age spread .",
    "however , there are other possibilities .",
    "we have made the general assumption that @xmath0 depends solely on @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with only an additional possible scatter ( e.g. , section [ section : combined effects_uncertanties_seleffects ] ) .",
    "in fact this is not the case : @xmath0 is also affected by other parameters , such as the temperature , mass and structure of the disc .",
    "let us consider a change in stellar radius produced by protostellar history ; our type c uncertainties .",
    "we assume that the temperature of the inner disk is dominated by irradiation from the central object , which is appropriate for low ( present - day ) @xmath0 .",
    "if a star shrinks rapidly due to an intense previous accretion phase , the disk temperature @xmath133 decreases @xmath134 . according to models of viscous disk evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this affects the disk viscosity , and @xmath135 . since ( at constant @xmath20 ) the isochronal age @xmath136",
    ", we have that @xmath137 , where the age @xmath6 here is not the real age , but that inferred from the hrd .",
    "thus if a star appears more compact so that its age is overestimated by 1 dex , its @xmath127 is expected to be lower by @xmath138  dex . however , this is a relatively small effect compared to the major biases we have found in this paper . in particular",
    "it seems incapable of mitigating the conclusion that age spreads @xmath130 are unlikely . for a coeval population where the apparent age spread is entirely due to the protostellar accretion history",
    "@xmath19 would be @xmath139 ( see appendix [ section : simulations - simplespread - coeval ] for type c ) , and hence much smaller than observed in young clusters .",
    "another possibility is that stars which have undergone vigorous protostellar accretion have current disk properties that inhibit further accretion .",
    "for example , their discs could have a lower inner temperature , be less massive , be more stable , or be truncated at a larger inner radius . in the scenario of @xcite , pms stars may accrete their mass through short - lived intense accretion bursts , reaching up to @xmath140  m@xmath141yr@xmath58 . during the burst phase",
    ", the inner disk heats up to very high temperatures ( @xmath142  k , @xcite ) , driving intense accretion through mri .",
    "if most of the stellar mass is built up by this process in a relatively short time ( @xmath143  myr ) , it is possible that at later stages @xmath0 remains on average lower than a star with a more steady and quiescent accretion history .",
    "thus , a fraction of `` bursting '' stars appear underluminous  hence , older  and with lower @xmath0 , mimicking an apparent decay of accretion even though they are coeval with the rest of the population .",
    "this speculative scenario may allow young populations to be more coeval than inferred from the hrd and for their accretion timescales to be longer .",
    "however it is completely unclear to what extent present - day and historical accretion rates are anti - correlated ( or correlated ) .",
    "it would take a large systematic difference in the present day @xmath0 , of 2 or more orders of magnitude between stars with different protostellar accretion histories to compensate for our finding that @xmath144 if @xmath145  dex in orion .",
    "last , as we anticipated in section [ section : the_problem_mdot ] , the standard methods to derive @xmath64 from @xmath30 , i.e. , equation [ equation : mdot1 ] , are a simplification of a more complex process . in particular the assumption @xmath146 is not realistic , as the inner disk radius is close to the co - rotation radius .",
    "if rotation rates are independent of isochronal ages , @xmath147 increases with isochronal age as the star shrinks .",
    "in addition , in the onc @xcite measured systematically slower rotation rates for older stars , so that their @xmath39 would be even larger .",
    "for the same measured @xmath30 , a larger @xmath39 implies a smaller @xmath0 than that derived from equation [ equation : mdot1 ] .",
    "thus , correcting for this effect would result in a larger @xmath19 even _ before _ correcting for the biases treated in this paper , making the main conclusions of this work stronger .",
    "also , as we discussed in section [ section : the_problem ] and [ section : simulations ] , the interplay between stellar properties and evolution , accretion process , and disk properties may involve more complicated correlations which could further modify the actual bias in @xmath2 ; however , we find it unlikely that additional unknown effects could forcibly invalidate our main conclusions .",
    "this work is based on simulations that aim to represent observational results in the onc . as we discussed in section  3.1 ,",
    "the spread of luminosities at a given @xmath20 in the onc is quite typical of other star forming regions .",
    "our simulations adopt a particular family of evolutionary models , the @xcite isochrones .",
    "@xcite showed that assuming 3 different families of evolutionary models to assign stellar parameters and @xmath0@xmath6 values , @xmath2 and @xmath66 remain nearly the same even though the average age of the cluster is model dependent by up to a factor 2 @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : evolmodels ] we further demonstrate that also the bias in @xmath2 , as the ratio @xmath88 is very weakly affected by the choice of evolutionary models , as it turns out to be nearly identical the simulations adopt @xcite isochrones rather than siess models , even though the two grids differ by more than a factor 2 in their absolute age scale .",
    "thus our particular choice of evolutionary models is largely irrelevant to our results .",
    "our analysis is based on a single imf @xcite .",
    "although large deviations from standard imfs are generally not observed for young clusters , at least in the stellar mass range @xcite , in principle a different imf might affect our results .",
    "however , our simulations show , that the bias in @xmath2 is very similar even when analysis is restricted to specific mass ranges .",
    "thus reasonable imf variations would not affect our results .",
    "there are no reasons to suppose that the accretion timescales in the onc are unrepresentative of typical pms evolution : @xmath19 in the onc is comparable with values measured with similar techniques ( stellar parameters derived with spectroscopy , @xmath0 from measuring flux excesses and equation [ equation : mdot1 ] ) in other regions @xcite .",
    "since these analyses share similar methods , and given that most of the uncertainties affecting young stars are either intrinsic to the nature of these objects , or due to the simplifying assumptions used to derive @xmath0 from observed quantities , we see no reasons to assume that uncertainties in the onc have a peculiar amplitude .    there remains the possibility that something in the onc environment could affect the evolution of accretion rates or the extent of any real age spread .",
    "o - stars in the central part of the onc are observed to be externally photoevaporating disks , yet the fraction of members with disks and detectable accretion ( @xmath148 , @xcite ) is similar to lower mass clusters at the same age @xcite .",
    "dynamical interactions in the densest parts of the onc may have slightly affected the disk radii distribution @xcite , but this also has little impact on the inner disks . as for the real age spread , it is generally assumed to depend on the cloud density @xcite , through the dynamical collapse time .",
    "the onc can be considered an `` average density '' star forming regions , between compact starburst clusters and sparse young populations .",
    "our analysis has made the assumptions that @xmath2 is obtained from the measured @xmath0 and isochronal @xmath6 in one cluster ; in some cases the stellar samples considered may include multiple separate stellar populations . under these circumstances , we distinguish two cases .",
    "if the mean ages of the populations are similar , differing by say less than their age spreads , then they can be treated as a single cluster and the bias in @xmath2 will be similar . if there is a larger difference in age , the sample could be considered as a single population with a larger real age spread ( and possibly also a larger overall apparent age spread than that measured in individual clusters ) . the quantitative effect on @xmath19 will depend on the exact values of these age spreads ; as the ratio between the overall real age spread ( from multiple populations ) and the total apparent observed age spread increases , the bias in @xmath2 is smaller , and vice - versa .",
    "in this work we have investigated how uncertainties in estimated stellar parameters ( mass , radius , age ) and observational selection effects bias estimates of the temporal decay of mass accretion rates , parameterised as @xmath149 .",
    "these uncertainties may be due to observational limitations ( e.g. photometric errors , differential extinction , accretion veiling etc . ) or to physical mechanisms such as variations in their protostellar accretion histories @xcite .",
    "the overall extent of this broadening is not well known , but many studies have suggested that these uncertainties are not negligible . as a consequence the bias in the measured value of @xmath2 originates from a combination of attenuation bias in the linear regression of @xmath150  const  since @xmath18 has large relative errors  and correlated uncertainties between the estimated stellar parameters and @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis assumes @xmath0 depends only on age and mass .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations that introduce uncertainties into the hertzsprung - russell diagram and observational selection effects and realistic combinations of these . in all cases",
    "the recovered @xmath19 inferred from the observational data is smaller than @xmath17 .",
    "if multiple types of uncertainties are simultaneously added , the relative contribution of each is largely irrelevant ; the result is dictated by the overall extent of uncertainties , which in turn depend on the _ apparent _ age spread determined from placing objects in the hrd and the fraction of this that is due to a _",
    "real _ spread in age .    assuming a typical apparent age spread observed in young clusters of @xmath91  dex but that only 0.2  dex of this is attributable to a real age spread ( for example in the orion nebula cluster , ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ) , then the @xmath15111.5 that is typically measured in the onc and other young galactic clusters , can only be reproduced if @xmath152 .",
    "if the real age spread were smaller ( @xmath153  dex ) , as advocated by fast star formation scenarios , the bias becomes extreme , implying an almost instantaneous decay of @xmath127 , which is incompatible with the detection of accretors in young clusters over a wide range of mean ages ( 1 - 10  myr ) .",
    "we conclude that clusters like the onc can not be coeval and must have an age spread @xmath154  dex .",
    "conversely , assuming the minimum levels of observational uncertainty , the corresponding real age spread be must be @xmath155  dex , and means @xmath17 would still be at least twice @xmath19 .",
    "the present uncertainties in the absolute age scale of pms stars and young clusters do not allow us to obtain an accretion decay timescale ; however the bias in @xmath2 is only weakly affected by the assumed age scale .",
    "observational selection effects , leading to incomplete samples as a function of mass or age introduce an additional bias to @xmath19 .",
    "depending on the detection limit and intrinsic scatter in the accretion rates , @xmath19 is always biased towards @xmath1561 .",
    "thus , a combination of selection effects together with uncertainties in the stellar parameters will worsen the apparent flattening of @xmath2 when @xmath110 , strengthening our conclusion that the decay of @xmath0 is much faster than the observed relationship between @xmath42 and @xmath18 .",
    "this result , and the suggestion that the real age spread in a young cluster can not be very small , could be mitigated if there were a strong anti - correlation between present - day @xmath0 and any previous protostellar accretion that gave the star a smaller radius and the _ appearance _ of being older .",
    "conversely , correcting the simplistic assumption that the inner disk radius is proportional to the stellar radius , by allowing for the influence of stellar rotation on disk truncation , could exacerbate the bias .",
    "additional scenarios originating from a more complex interplay between stellar , disk and accretion properties as well as observational biases in their estimation may add further bias in @xmath2 or partially mitigate our results .",
    "however , the magnitude of the bias in @xmath2 we have found is so large that unknown additional effects would have to introduce very strong correlations to alter our main conclusions .",
    "lastly , our analysis can not directly explain the observation that the measured @xmath0@xmath6 relation can appear flatter for solar - mass pms stars than those of lower mass @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that any radius and hence apparent age perturbation due to varying protostellar accretion histories , plays a more important role , and introduces a greater bias in the measured @xmath2 , in intermediate mass stars , as suggested by @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : simplespread_tautau02 ] also shows that this result is only weakly dependent on the mass dependence of @xmath0 , as @xmath19 changes by @xmath162 between @xmath81 to @xmath93 .",

    "we now test how the bias in @xmath19 is influenced by the assumed real age spread @xmath170 .",
    "specifically , we test smaller and larger values than previously assumed , namely , @xmath171  dex and @xmath172  dex . once again , the age distribution peaks at 2.5  myr .",
    "the simulations are as in section [ section : simulations - simplespread - onc ] , except that , in order to reach the same apparent observed @xmath73 , we add luminosity spreads @xmath173 = 0.27  dex and 0.15  dex for the cases of @xmath174  dex and 0.3  dex respectively .    the results are shown in figure [ fig : simplespread_tautau013 ] . if the assumed real age spread is smaller , the bias in @xmath2 increases , producing both a more prominent flattening of the @xmath19 versus @xmath17 correlation , and a larger offset from correlated uncertainties ( the intercept @xmath175 ) .",
    "such increased bias is due to the larger amount of luminosity scatter needed to obtain the same observed @xmath176 starting from a smaller @xmath177 .",
    "the opposite occurs when the real age spread increases and the relative contribution from apparent luminosity spreads is smaller .    in the presence of only luminosity spreads ,",
    "the assumption of @xmath174 leads to a very severe bias : considering the full mass range ( solid lines ) , @xmath19 is always @xmath178 , even for @xmath179 , @xmath93 and bias type a. since in reality a combination of cases a , b , and c is expected , a value @xmath180 or more would be needed to reproduce the slope observed in the onc and other young regions ( * ? ? ? * , @xmath3 ) .",
    "with such an instantaneous decay of @xmath0 , no accreting sources would be detected in clusters older than a few myr .",
    "we also explore the limiting case of a fully coeval young stellar population , whose apparent age spread from the measured hrd is solely due to uncertainties in @xmath24 ( bias of types a and b ) , or a luminosity spread induced by differences in the protostellar accretion history ( bias of type c ) .",
    "we start with a @xmath181  myr population and add a luminosity spread as in the previous subsections .",
    "the input value @xmath17 is now meaningless , as all simulated stars share the same age ; instead , we vary the amount of luminosity spread and each time we fit the measured @xmath42  @xmath6 relation determining @xmath19 . again",

    "a , correlated uncertainties generate a positive value of @xmath19 , i.e. , an apparent temporal decrease of @xmath0 , with @xmath184@xmath185 for 0.4  dex of apparent age spread and depending on the assumed @xmath66 . on the contrary ,",
    "bias of type c produces a negative @xmath19 , down to @xmath186 , and type b lies in between . as the luminosity spread will likely be some combination of the 3 cases , then accretion rates in a coeval population should show an apparent correlation with age with @xmath187 .",
    "this result , leaving aside the additional caveats reported in section [ section : discussion ] , provides a test for the coevality of any young population : it is difficult to advocate coevality for a cluster in which @xmath188 .",
    "we analyze now the bias in @xmath2 from uncertainties in @xmath20 alone , using the same technique we adopted for spreads in luminosity ( section [ section : simulations - simplespread ] ) .",
    "we start with two values for the real age spread , @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "the @xmath20 of the simulated stars are displaced with gaussian shifts with standard deviation of either half or one spectral subtypes ; we assume the temperature scale of @xcite for the conversion between spectral types and @xmath20 . in principle",
    "an error in an assigned spectral types may propagate to the estimated @xmath24 as well , in two cases : a ) when it leads to an error in the estimated @xmath21 , this case will be explored in section [ section : simulations - teffav ] ; b ) when the bolometric corrections used to obtain @xmath35 are quite sensitive to @xmath20 .",
    "the latter is generally not a significant effect , when @xmath35 is derived from apparent magnitudes close to the peak of the stellar seds , e.g. , photometry in the red optical range for low - mass stars .",
    "we consider that the bias in @xmath166 from @xmath20 errors always follows type a ( see section [ section : simulation_howtheywork ] ) .",
    "this is a fair approximation , since , generally , errors in @xmath20 do not significantly affect the accretion luminosity contrast @xmath48 . strictly speaking",
    ", this holds if the bolometric correction of the photospheric flux , at the wavelength of the indicator used to estimate @xmath30 ( e.g. , h@xmath31 ) , is weakly dependent on @xmath20 .",
    "figure [ fig : teff_tautau ] shows the results : as for the luminosity spreads , @xmath191 .",
    "the bias is significant even for the modest error of 1/2 a spectral subtype , which is practically the smallest uncertainty achievable with spectroscopy : the flattening is at least @xmath192 when the entire mass range is considered ( solid lines ) and starting from a large initial age spread . for larger age",
    "spreads the bias is smaller , because the stellar population is already well spread in the hrd , and thus an additional uncertainty in @xmath20 introduces a smaller relative broadening of the width of the age distribution .",
    "when the parameters of pms stars are derived from optical data in the presence of differential @xmath21 , an error in @xmath20 also to leads to a correlated error in @xmath21 , and thus in @xmath35 .",
    "this is because , given an observed color for a star , if @xmath20 is overestimated ( e.g. , from inaccurate spectral type assignment ) , the intrinsic photospheric color will be underestimated , the reddening overestimated , and the intrinsic luminosity also overestimated .",
    "thus , @xmath20 errors tend to produce diagonal shifts in the hrd , whose inclination depends on the photometric bands used to derive stellar parameters , and typically will be steeper for shorter wavelengths",
    ". this type of error will also apply to any analyses where a uniform reddening is assumed for a population where some level of differential extinction exists .",
    "we run another set of simulations as before , and apply a spread in the hrd due to extinction uncertainties . to define the correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath24 , we assume that the hrd is derived from an optical @xmath193 versus @xmath194 cmd . first ,",
    "considering the galactic reddening law of @xcite , we derive the @xmath194 and @xmath193 shifts due to @xmath195 .",
    "these are then converted into @xmath20 and @xmath24 shifts , as a function of @xmath20 , based on synthetic photometry using the code ta - da @xcite and assuming the bt - settl synthetic spectra from @xcite .",
    "we randomly displace each source in @xmath20 and @xmath24 from a uniform probability distribution in the range @xmath196@xmath197 .",
    "we run simulations for two amounts of differential extinction : a low ( @xmath198  mag ) and an intermediate one ( @xmath199  mag ) , and , as before , for two intrinsic age spreads : @xmath200=0.2 and 0.4 dex . as for errors in @xmath20 ( section [ section : simulations - teff ] ) , this uncertainty follows a type a bias ( section [ section : simulation_howtheywork ] ) , since the relative excess @xmath48 is only weakly dependant on @xmath21 .",
    "this holds in particular when @xmath49 excess together with optical fluxes are used to measure accretion @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : teffav_tautau ] .",
    "once again , the @xmath201 ; however , the relative bias is smaller than that of simple @xmath20 errors ( figure [ fig : teff_tautau ] ) .",
    "this is because the reddening vector , in @xmath202 and @xmath203 bands , is almost parallel to the low - mass pms isochrones , and therefore extinction does not significantly alter the isochronal ages .",
    "this is not the case when restricting to intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath204  m@xmath15 ) , for which we find @xmath19 is 2030% smaller than the @xmath17 .",
    "estimates of @xmath0 and stellar parameters rely on stellar evolutionary models ; hence , the derived @xmath2 remain model dependent .",
    "there are open problems with current pms isochrones , as the different families of models differ in their predictions @xcite and often deviate systematically from the data @xcite . in what follows",
    "we investigate if the adopted set of models , or an empirical calibration of them in the hrd , have important effects on the biases in @xmath2 .          throughout our simulations",
    ", we have used @xcite isochrones ; here we test if the bias in @xmath2 is heavily dependent on the assumed evolutionary models . to this end",
    ", we consider isochrones from @xcite , as they present some of the largest systematic differences compared to siess .",
    "in particular , their models predict a much younger age for pms stars , for instance , a mean age of 1  myr for the onc , less than half of that predicted by siess isochrones .",
    "thus , to generate a synthetic population in the hrd comparable with our previous simulations , we simulate cluster populations with a mean age of 1  myr from @xcite isochrones .    for simplicity ,",
    "we test only the case of a luminosity spread in the hrd , and use the same assumptions as in appendix [ section : simulations - simplespread - onc ] , i.e. , a real age spread @xmath86 and additional scatter in @xmath24 to reach an apparent measured @xmath205 .",
    "the resulting @xmath19 versus @xmath17 is shown in figure [ fig : simplespread_tautau02_dantona ] .",
    "the bias in @xmath2 for the 3 types of uncertainties is almost identical to that we obtained for the analogous simulations from siess models ( figure [ fig : simplespread_tautau02 ] ) , despite the large systematic difference in the predicted absolute ages between these two grids of evolutionary models .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spacing in @xmath24 between contiguous isochrones ( in @xmath18 ) remains similar even when different families of models show large offsets in their absolute age scales .",
    "our result shows that the ratio @xmath206 is largely unaffected by the choice of evolutionary models .",
    "furthermore , for a given cluster the value @xmath19 does not change much if one uses different evolutionary models ; this was shown e.g. , by @xcite for the onc , and also supported by the fact that measurements of @xmath2 in the literature , on a multitude of young clusters , and based on a heterogeneity of assumptions and models do not show noticeable differences in their results .",
    "hence we argue that the true value of @xmath2  and the biases therein  suggested by the modeling in this paper are not induced by our particular choice of adopting the @xcite isochrones .",
    "-dependent luminosity shift sufficient match the observed population .",
    "[ fig : acchistory_cmd ] ]        in the previous subsection we analyzed the effect of discrepancies between different evolutionary models . here",
    "we focus on their general deviation from the observations .",
    "one of these discrepancies is the apparent correlation between mass and average age for pms clusters @xcite , as in a young system intermediate - mass stars appear generally older than low - mass stars , by several myr ( see figure [ fig : acchistory_cmd ] .",
    "if this systematic difference were real , it implies a significant temporal delay of a few myr in the formation of low - mass stars in a cluster .",
    "this seems unlikely and the trend probably indicates an inaccurate prediction by the evolutionary models .",
    "there are many possible origins for this inconsistency .",
    "several assumptions in the modeling of pms mass tracks affect the predicted stellar parameters in different ways depending on the mass @xcite : for example , reducing the mixing length could remove the mass - age correlation @xcite . alternatively , whereas standard pms tracks are computed assuming an evolution without accretion , the inclusion of mass accretion in the modeling also affects the predicted parameters , in particular leads to smaller radii - therefore fainter luminosities @xcite .",
    "this is expected to have a negligible effect for low - mass stars @xcite , but could be significant at masses @xmath207 .",
    "we consider this second scenario , and assume that the standard isochrones overestimate the predicted @xmath24 for intermediate masses .",
    "we quantify the required correction empirically , based on the measured hrd of the onc from @xcite .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : acchistory_cmd ] , together with @xcite evolutionary models .",
    "the dashed red line is the isochrone corresponding to the mean isochronal age of the cluster ( 2.5  myr ) .",
    "we have computed the required shift in @xmath24 from this isochrone , as a function of @xmath20 , to match the mean observed luminosities ; the resulting locus is the blue dashed line in figure [ fig : acchistory_cmd ] .",
    "thus , the two lines correspond , respectively , to the parameters that these models _ do _ predict , and those they _ should _ predict . since observations , as well as our simulations in this paper , are based on the standard isochrones ,",
    "this is a further bias we investigate .    for our purposes",
    ", it is practical to treat this systematic effect in reverse : we assume that the siess isochrones are correct , and that some other effect shrinks the stellar radii of an amount equal to the difference between the two lines in figure [ fig : acchistory_cmd ] .",
    "we run a simulation as in the previous section , where in this case the positions of the simulated sources in the hrd are displaced with a rigid , @xmath20-dependent shift in @xmath34 , instead of with a random scatter .",
    "this case now follows a bias of type c ( see section [ section : simulation_howtheywork ] , since effectively the measured stellar @xmath34 @xmath24 are correct , whereas @xmath7 and @xmath6 are wrongly inferred from the models .    the results are shown in figure [ fig : tautau_acchistory ] . considering the entire sample ( solid lines ) ,",
    "@xmath19 is generally lower than @xmath17 .",
    "when we separate the mass ranges , it is evident that this is due mainly to the contribution of intermediate mass stars ( dash - dotted lines ) , for which @xmath17 is underestimated by 1525% .",
    "as anticipated in section [ section : intro ] , sample incompleteness , from either lack of detection of stellar members , or lack of measurement of @xmath0 for weak accretors , introduces selection effects in the @xmath0@xmath6 plane .",
    "figure [ fig : selection_effects ] shows a quantitative example of these effects .",
    "we have considered 3 stellar masses , 0.2 , 0.6 and 2 m@xmath15 , and computed the variation of the stellar luminosity and accretion excess with age and @xmath0 .",
    "we assumed that the h@xmath31 excess is the observational indicator to measure @xmath0 , and the specific technique is narrow band photometry with the @xmath208 wide field camera 3 filter @xmath209 .",
    "we computed , for every @xmath6 and @xmath0 , both the measured excess in magnitudes in @xmath209 and the total absolute magnitude ( photosphere and excess ) .",
    "this was done as follows : first , we applied equation [ equation : mdot2 ] to translate @xmath0 into @xmath48 . from the latter we derived @xmath210 assuming the relation from @xcite @xmath211 next , we derived the equivalent width of the @xmath49 line excess from : @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the photospheric spectral energy distribution of the star , for which we assumed bt - settl synthetic spectra from @xcite .",
    "last , we derived the associated ( positive ) excess in magnitudes from : @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the equivalent width of the filter .",
    "we also computed , for every mass and age , the photospheric magnitude @xmath216 by means of synthetic photometry using the tool ta - da @xcite , again using bt - settl models .",
    "finally , the observed magnitude is the sum of photosphere and excess : @xmath217 .",
    "the solid contours in figure [ fig : selection_effects ] indicate constant absolute magnitude : at very low @xmath0 the excess is negligible , thus @xmath218 is dominated by the photosphere and depends only on age , leading to vertical contours . at higher @xmath0 , however , the excess which correlates with the stellar parameters , leads to shallow correlations between @xmath0 and age at a fixed magnitude .",
    "if the detection limit is shallow enough ( for instance , @xmath219 ) , in the low mass range ( e.g. 0.2  m@xmath15 ) the detection threshold will be inclined in @xmath0 - @xmath6 plane , as the contours show .",
    "depending on the depth of the sample , such a cut alters the underlying correlation between these two quantities .",
    "the dotted contours in figure [ fig : selection_effects ] , on the other hand , indicate constant magnitude excess @xmath220 , respectively 0.1  mag ( lower lines ) and 1  mag ( upper line ) .",
    "again , these loci are inclined in the plane , so when the measurement of @xmath0 is limited by the ability to isolate a small accretion - related excess from noises or other uncertainties , the sample of measured @xmath0 will suffer from a correlated selection effect with age .",
    "as shown , in this case the problem dominates at large masses , where high values of @xmath0 produce small flux excesses .",
    "we model a more realistic representation of these effects to understand their overall influence on @xmath19 for a stellar population .",
    "we simulate a young population as in section [ section : simulations ] , assuming a mean age @xmath76  myr , an age spread @xmath221  dex , and assign values of @xmath0 assuming with b=2 and variable @xmath17 .",
    "for each generated star , considering its stellar parameters and @xmath0 , we compute both the magnitude excess in @xmath49 , @xmath220 , and the total ( absolute ) magnitude @xmath218 as we did before for figure [ fig : selection_effects ] .",
    "we introduce a detection limit @xmath222 , for which the assumed signal to noise ratio is 3 and the completeness abruptly drops from 100% to 0 .",
    "this simplified choice allows us to isolate the general bias due selection effects without adding unnecessary scatter due to the stochasticity of source detection .",
    "we assign to every magnitude @xmath218 a photometric error , assuming that it is only due to shot noise from photon counting , thus : @xmath223 as another general assumption , we assume that h@xmath31 photometry is responsible for all the incompleteness and photometric uncertainty affecting the sample . since in practice",
    "photometric estimates of @xmath0 generally require additional broad band photometry to isolate the excess ( e.g. , @xmath224 and @xmath193 , @xcite ) , this implies the latter should be significantly deeper than h@xmath31 .",
    "figure [ fig : selection_effects_population ] shows the result for 3 combinations of @xmath17 and @xmath222 producing a significant incompleteness in the pms mass range .",
    "depending on the magnitude limit , some stars are too faint to be detected .",
    "also , another fraction are detected , but their accretion excess is smaller than the photometric error , leading to an average estimate of @xmath0 compatible with 0 and the removal of these sources from the @xmath107@xmath18 plane .",
    "the remaining detections show a correlation of @xmath0 with age , determined through linear fit , which differs from the real one , and is much shallower for the 3 cases shown in figure [ fig : selection_effects_population ] .",
    "we have inspected a broad range of assumed @xmath17 , @xmath66 and @xmath222 ; the examples in figure [ fig : selection_effects_population ] appear representative of the general behavior , except if @xmath225 , in which case the diagonal threshold in the @xmath0 increases @xmath19 by a few tenths .",
    "the scatter of the @xmath0 values at a given age shown in figure [ fig : selection_effects_population ] is solely due to the mass dependence introduced by @xmath93 . in reality",
    "an additional scatter at any @xmath7 and @xmath6 is expected , as the measured @xmath0 depends not only on @xmath7 and @xmath6 , but can also vary star by star due to differences in the disk properties , temporal variability of @xmath0 , or due to poorly understood correlations with the stellar parameters ( see e.g. , figure [ fig : simplespread_mdot_age ] ) .",
    "we test if this modifies the bias due to selection effects .",
    "we repeat the same simulation adding a random gaussian scatter to @xmath42 before computing the photospheric and excess magnitudes .",
    "we assume a @xmath226 width of 0.65 dex : this is the extent of the random star - to - star variations of @xmath0 needed to obtain a total standard deviation of the data points in the @xmath107@xmath18 plane that matches the 0.85 dex found in the onc by @xcite .",
    "we also add 0.1  mag in quadrature to the assumed photometric errors @xmath227 from equation [ equation : photerrha ] .",
    "this is to avoid the results being altered by unrealistically small photometric errors at bright magnitudes .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : selection_effects_population_scatter ] ; data corresponding to good detections and non detections appear scattered , but the general trends are not very different from those of figure [ fig : selection_effects_population ] .",
    "we can not derive a general correction for these types of selection effects , as in reality they depend on multiple factors : e.g. , the detection completeness functions and the photometric error distribution in each band , as well as the other overall uncertainties affecting both magnitudes and stellar parameters , and the possible inaccuracy of the atmosphere models we assumed in our modeling .",
    "however , if the studied stellar population is characterized to a much fainter luminosity than those for which @xmath166 is assessable ( e.g. , through broad band photometry ) , it is useful to study the fraction of accretors as a function of age ( and mass ) .",
    "this is because , if the age spread within a region is sufficiently small , one would not expect any significant variation of the fraction of detected accretors with age or mass .",
    "if on the contrary , as evident from the right panels of figures [ fig : selection_effects_population ] and [ fig : selection_effects_population_scatter ] , at low masses the detected accretors tend to be all younger than the cluster average age , strong selection effects in the samples may be present and bias @xmath19 ."
