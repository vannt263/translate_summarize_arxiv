    "we can see that the simple model @xmath123 is suitable for the isotope effects of fulleride rb@xmath4c@xmath5 for different ratios of substitutions because the an - harmonic parameters are within the range to obtain experimental values of @xmath1 .",

    "the reductions of @xmath1 with increasing the substitution ratios of @xmath3c are due to the reductions of an - harmonic effects of lattice vibrations when the ratios of substitution tend to 100% .",
    "the enhanced coefficients of isotope effects with @xmath0 generally happen at the intermediate stage of transition from one phase to another .",
    "finally , the formula eq.([new_eq ] ) and the numerical methods used in this paper are also suitable to study isotope effects of other superconductors if the electron - phonon interaction is the pairing mechanism for electrons .    the author benefits from the discussions with members within cms group at issp - cas , especially from dr .",
