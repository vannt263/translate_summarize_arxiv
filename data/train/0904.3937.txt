    "in recent years , resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) has been used as a probe of various types of electronic excitations in many condensed matter systems.@xcite in these studies , when the incident photon energy is tuned to the x - ray absorption edge of interest , the intensity of certain spectral features is greatly enhanced , sometimes by up to a few orders of magnitude .",
    "initially , soft x - ray photons were used to study the electronic structure in semiconductors and insulators.@xcite recently , rixs at transition metal k edges has also been gaining interest due to the added benefit of the momentum - resolving capability provided by the short wavelength of the hard x - ray photons.@xcite such transition metal k - edge rixs is often called _ indirect _ rixs , since the intermediate state does not directly involve 3d photoelectrons , unlike rixs in the soft x - ray regime ( transition metal l - edges ) , which is therefore referred to as _",
    "direct_.    one of the attractions presented by hard x - ray rixs is the possibility of its use in studying momentum - resolved electronic structure . in a simple picture of the rixs cross - section , the momentum - dependent part of the cross - section may be expressed as the joint density of states ( jdos ) of the unoccupied and occupied bands for a particular momentum transfer.@xcite in other words , the rixs spectrum can be regarded as measuring inter - band transitions at a finite momentum transfer , with an appropriate prefactor . although this viewpoint is probably too simplistic , attempts to develop a linear response theory for the rixs cross - section based on this approach have been made.@xcite for example , in the limit of either very weak or very strong core hole potential , van den brink and van veenendaal have shown that the indirect rixs cross section is a linear combination of the charge response function and the dynamic longitudinal spin density correlation function.@xcite this line of approach is quite intriguing , since it suggests that one could use rixs as a tool for reconstructing electronic structure at the finite momentum transfer.@xcite    despite extensive rixs investigations of strongly correlated cuprate compounds , little work has been done to date to study conventional semiconductors with well - known electronic structure .",
    "this is unfortunate , because investigation of well - characterized materials with a known band structure is essential to formulate quantitative understanding of this new experimental technique . in this paper , we present just such an investigation of semiconducting @xmath0 , using the cu k - edge rixs technique , and show that the indirect rixs can measure jdos of this weakly correlated system .",
    "cuprous oxide , @xmath0 , is a naturally occurring mineral called  cuprite . \"",
    "it is a direct - gap semiconductor with well - characterized exciton lines , which are often considered as textbook examples of mott - wannier type excitons.@xcite in particular , bose - einstein condensation of the exciton gas has been reported and has drawn much attention over the last two decades.@xcite in recent years , however , this material has been drawing renewed interest due to its potential applications in solar energy conversion and catalysis .",
    "@xcite considerable attention has also been paid to this material due to the unusual o - cu - o linear bonding .",
    "@xcite    cuprous oxide crystallizes in a cubic structure with space group @xmath2.@xcite since hayashi and katsuki s measurement of exciton absorption lines,@xcite early experimental work on this material focused mostly on optical absorption studies of the different exciton series , and is reviewed in refs .  .",
    "further , the electronic structure of @xmath0 has been studied using various _ ab initio _",
    "methods.@xcite these studies suggest that @xmath0 is a semiconductor with direct band gap , although the calculated gap varies widely among the different approaches , and typically disagrees with the experimental value of about 2 ev .",
    "( for a comprehensive comparison , see table i in ref .  )",
    ".    advances in core level spectroscopy techniques developed at synchrotron x - ray sources have made it possible to test some of the earlier predictions concerning the electronic structure of @xmath3 .",
    "x - ray absorption studies near copper l - edges@xcite as well as at the o k - edge @xcite have been carried out to elucidate the unoccupied bands .",
    "ghijsen and coworkers carried out both x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy ( bis ) to probe both valence band and conduction band density of states , respectively.@xcite these experimental results could be largely accounted for with the calculated band structure , confirming that @xmath0 is a conventional band insulator with no , or very weak , electron correlation .",
    "the top of the valence band is dominated by cu @xmath4 states , while the lowest lying conduction band is primarily of @xmath4-character which hybridizes with cu @xmath5 and @xmath6 states , and o @xmath7 states .    as a result of the renewed interest in this material ,",
    "there have been several recent studies of the electronic structure of @xmath3 using state - of - the - art electron spectroscopy techniques .",
    "bruneval and coworkers measured the valence band dispersion along the @xmath1 direction with the angle resolved photoemisson spectroscopy ( arpes ) , and were able to explain the observed dispersion using a self - consistent gw method,@xcite while nsten et al . used high - energy arpes to measure the valence band dispersion along the @xmath8 direction.@xcite finally , and of particular interest here , hu et al .",
    "carried out comprehensive soft x - ray ( direct ) rixs studies of @xmath0 , and have compared their results with a calculation based on jdos - like interband transitions.@xcite    in this paper , we present a detailed study of @xmath0 using indirect rixs . in particular , we will focus on the energy region near the band gap , and report our measurement of the dispersion relation of the band - gap edge along the @xmath1 direction .",
    "the observed momentum dependence of the gap edge is consistent with the dispersion of the valence band as observed with arpes.@xcite in addition , we observe another band of excitations at 6.5 ev , which can be explained as interband transitions from the occupied cu 3d state to the unoccupied state , which is a mixture of cu 3d , 4s , and o 2p .",
    "we contrast this with the soft rixs data of hu et al.@xcite taken together , these results suggest that the indirect ( cu k - edge ) rixs is a good probe of electronic structure .",
    "the rixs experiments were carried out at the advanced photon source on the undulator beamline 9idb .",
    "a double - bounce si(333 ) monochromator and a spherical ( r=1  m ) , diced ge(733 ) analyzer was used to obtain an overall energy resolution of 0.4 ev ( fwhm ) .",
    "we also utilized a high - resolution setup with a si(444 ) channel - cut secondary monochromator and a diced ge(733 ) analyzer with 2  m radius of curvature .",
    "this provides an overall energy resolution of 0.13  ev .",
    "a single crystal sample of @xmath0 was grown using the traveling solvent floating zone method .",
    "the details of the crystal growth was reported in ref .  .",
    "the crystal used in the rixs measurements came from the same batch as the one used in the optical studies reported in ref .  .",
    "the as - grown crystal was mechanically polished and etched in order to optimize the surface condition .",
    "the crystal was mounted on an aluminium sample holder at room temperature inside an evacuated chamber .",
    "most of the measurements were carried out near the * q*=(2,0,1 ) point , which also corresponds to a reciprocal wave vector * g*. the reduced momentum transfer * q * is defined as @xmath9 , and is measured from the brillouin zone center .",
    "note that the @xmath0 structure is composed of an interpenetrating fcc lattice of cu and a bcc lattice of o. therefore , @xmath10 reflections with unmixed indices ( @xmath11 all even or all odd ) will have a strong bragg peak intensity , following the fcc structure factor , while the reflections with mixed indices , but @xmath12=even , will have a weak bragg peak intensity coming from the bcc lattice of oxygens .",
    "reflections with @xmath12=odd , such as the ( 2,0,1 ) point , are forbidden .",
    "however , eichhorn and coworkers reported intensity at such positions with the incident energy near the cu k - edge , due to the anisotropic cu environment.@xcite as a result , the @xmath13 point data were in fact taken at the ( 2,0.05,1 ) position , to reduce the background due to the resonant elastic intensity .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : resonance ] , we show representative rixs scans obtained with different incident photon energies ( @xmath14 ) as denoted on the left side of the figure . each scan is taken at the ( 2,0.05,1 ) position , and plotted as a function of energy loss ( @xmath15 ) . in each scan",
    ", there is a large zero energy loss peak arising from the quasi - elastic background due to phonons and static disorder .",
    "in addition , there is a broad , strong feature on the high energy side of the scan . between these two prominent features",
    ", one can observe a sharp edge - like rixs feature around @xmath16 ev , which exhibits a large resonant enhancement at @xmath17 ev .    in general",
    ", there are two distinct types of spectral features observed by rixs : one is a valence electron excitation that appears at fixed energy loss ( @xmath18 ) regardless of the incident energy , similar to raman scattering peaks .",
    "the sharp edge - like feature at 2 ev corresponds to such an excitation .",
    "the other type is due to emission lines arising from radiative transitions between atomic - like states , which are observed at fixed final photon energy ( @xmath19 ) . when plotted as a function of energy loss , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] , the peak position of the latter features therefore shifts as the incident energy is varied above the edge .",
    "the broad feature at higher energy ( @xmath20 ev ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] corresponds to such a feature .",
    "( 2 0 1 ) , plotted as a function of energy loss , @xmath18 .",
    "the scans are shifted vertically for clarity .",
    "the incident energy for each scan can be read off from the vertical axis . ]",
    "the sharp edge - like feature shows quite a narrow resonance behavior around the incident energy of @xmath17 ev .",
    "we note that this energy corresponds to the sharp peak in the x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) shown in fig .  8 of ref .   and fig .  8 of ref .  .",
    "since this is the strongest absorption feature , we can associate this incident energy , and the corresponding intermediate state of the resonant inelastic process , with the @xmath21 state following a @xmath22 dipole transition , where @xmath23 denotes a @xmath24 core hole .",
    "since cu is found with cu@xmath25 valence in @xmath0 , this intermediate state energy is shifted down by about 10 ev compared to the cu@xmath26 state in cuprate materials like @xmath27.@xcite note that the rixs spectra showed no dependence on the incident photon polarization , presumably due to the cubic symmetry of the sample .",
    "we identify this sharp edge - like feature as the * q*=0 band gap , since its energy - loss of @xmath28 ev coincides with the optical gap energy .",
    "as we will see in the next section , this identification is corroborated by the momentum dependence of this feature .",

    "[ fig : resonance ] .",
    "one can clearly identify a very broad and strong spectral feature located at around @xmath29 ev , which is resonantly enhanced over a wide range of incident energies ; most notably around @xmath30 ev and @xmath31 ev . in addition , there is a higher energy feature at @xmath32 ev , and a weak low energy feature located around @xmath33 ev that resonates around @xmath31 ev . since the peak positions of the loss features do not change with the incident energy , we chose to examine the @xmath34 ev scan , which exhibit all three features in more detail .",
    "these data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : soft ] .    to understand the origin of these excitations",
    ", it is useful to consider the electronic density of states . using both xps and bis techniques , ghijsen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported valence band and conduction band density of states for @xmath0 .",
    "the most prominent peak in bis occurs around 3 ev above the fermi level , while xps shows a large peak centered around 3 ev below the fermi level with shoulders on both sides .",
    "the density of states based on these xps and bis results are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](a ) .",
    "the main peak in the xps spectra is mainly of cu d - character ( based on the various calculations ) , while the larger binding energy shoulder , at about 7 ev below the fermi level , has mainly o @xmath7 character.@xcite the nature of the low - lying unoccupied states has been attributed to mixed @xmath35 states@xcite or to cu @xmath5 states.@xcite . given this picture , it is natural to associate the @xmath36 ev rixs feature with the transition from the @xmath37 to either @xmath35 mixture or @xmath5 .",
    "then the higher energy rixs feature at 9 - 10  ev presumably is due to the transition from the occupied o @xmath7 to empty @xmath37 or @xmath5 states .    to make a more quantitative comparison , the hard rixs scan obtained with @xmath34 ev",

    ".   exhibits a very different shape , with an energy loss feature centered around 4.5 ev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : soft ] ( open circles ) .",
    "hu and coworkers used a phenomenological excitonic density of states in order to account for this discrepancy .",
    "this was an ad - hoc approach that used the experimental l - edge absorption spectrum ( for which there is a 2p core hole in the final state ) in place of the calculated occupied dos .",
    "this was labeled the  excitonic dos \" .",
    "although there is no 2p core hole in the l - edge rixs final state , such excitonic dos was required to explain experimental observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : soft ] shows that no such ad - hoc corrections are required to explain the k - edge rixs data , which are well reproduced by the theoretical jdos .",

    "this is shown for this simplified band structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](c ) .",
    "since the conduction bandwidth is much larger than the valence bandwidth in this case , the _ lower bound _ of inter - band transitions is dominated by the valence band . in other words ,",
    "the lower bound transitions involve exciting electrons from all @xmath58 positions of the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band ( @xmath62 ) , since it takes more energy to excite electrons into finite @xmath60 states in conduction band .",

    "comparison with cu @xmath41-edge rixs spectrum and a calculation based on band - structure density - of - states clearly illustrates that the indirect rixs spectrum of @xmath0 obtained at the cu k - edge can be explained simply by interband transitions .",
