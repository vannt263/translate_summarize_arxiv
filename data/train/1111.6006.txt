    "the properties of @xmath4 are largely governed by the dynamics of the qcd @xmath5 axial vector anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the light pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath2 ) are the nambu - goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of the qcd chiral symmetry .",
    "introducing the current quark masses these mesons together with the heavier @xmath0(958 ) meson show a mass spectrum which is believed to be explained by the explicit flavor @xmath8 breaking and the axial @xmath5 anomaly .",
    "recently , there have been several important developments in the study of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and its partial restoration at finite density  @xcite .",
    "an indirect evidence has been claimed for a dropping @xmath0 mass in the hot and dense matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "+ an experimental approach to learn about the @xmath9 interaction is the study of @xmath4 photoproduction off nuclei which provides information on in - medium properties of the @xmath0-meson . the in - medium width of the @xmath4-meson can be extracted from the attenuation of the @xmath0-meson flux deduced from a measurement of the transparency ratio for a number of nuclei . unless when removed by inelastic channels the @xmath0-meson will decay outside of the nucleus because of its long lifetime and thus its in - medium mass is not accessible experimentally .",
    "the in - medium width provides information on the strength of the @xmath9 interaction , as it is studied in @xcite , and it will be instructive to compare this result with in - medium widths obtained for other mesons .",
    "furthermore , knowledge of the @xmath0 in - medium width is important for the feasibility of observing @xmath0 - nucleus bound systems theoretically predicted in some models @xcite . until the last two years @xmath0 photoproduction was not much explored , but with new generation experiments results on differential and total cross sections of @xmath0 photoproduction on the proton  @xcite and the deuteron  @xcite have now become available .",
    "the experiment has been performed at the elsa facility in bonn  @xcite using the crystal barrel(cb )  @xcite and taps  @xcite detector system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exp ] left ) .",
    "the combined crystal barrel / taps detector covered 99% of the full 4@xmath6 solid angle .",
    "the high granularity of the system makes it very well suited for the detection of multi - photon final states .",
    "tagged photon beams of energy up to 2.6 gev were produced via bremsstrahlung and impinged on a solid target . for the measurements targets of @xmath10 and @xmath11 were used . a more detailed description of the detector setup and the running conditions have been given in  @xcite .",
    "the detector acceptance was determined by monte carlo simulations using the geant3 package , including all features of the detector system , trigger conditions and all cuts for particle indentification .",
    "to avoid further uncertainties due to reaction kinematics and final state interactions , the @xmath0-meson detection efficiency was simulated as a function of the kinetic energy and the polar angle - @xmath12 .",
    "typical efficiencies are 5 - 7% and also slightly different for the different targets . the detection efficiency for @xmath0 on the @xmath13 target , taking the trigger conditions into account , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp ] ( right ) . experimental data are efficiency corrected event - by - event with this acceptance as described in @xcite .",
    "+      the @xmath0-mesons were identified via the @xmath14 decay channel , which has a branching ratio of 8% . for the reconstruction of the @xmath0-mesons only events with 6 or 7 neutral hits have been selected .",
    "the competing channel with the same final state , namely @xmath15 , has been reconstructed and the corresponding events have been rejected from the further analysis .",
    "in addition only events were kept with at least one combination of the 6 photons to two photon pairs with invariant masses between 110 and 160 mev ( @xmath16 ) and one pair between 500 and 600 mev ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the @xmath17 invariant mass distributions for the different solid targets are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : invmass ] .",
    "the spectra were fitted with a gaussian and a background function @xmath18 .",
    "alternatively , the background shape was also fitted with a polynomial.the resulting cross sections are used to calculate the transparency ratio of the @xmath0-meson for a given nucleus @xmath19 from the formula  ( [ eq : trans ] ) , normalized to the carbon data : @xmath20    @xmath21 describes the loss of flux of @xmath0-mesons in nuclei via inelastic processes like : @xmath22 . to avoid systematic uncertainties due to unknown secondary production processes ,",
    "the transparency ratio has been normalized to a light target with equal numbers of protons and neutrons ( c ) and not to the cross section on the nucleon .",
    "the transparency ratio has been extracted as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : trans ] and is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ta ] for the @xmath0-meson ( red triangles ) compared to the transparency ratio of the @xmath3-meson ( blue circles ) measured by  @xcite and the transparency ratio of the @xmath2-meson ( black squares ) deduced from  @xcite .",
    "the solid lines are fits to the data points , yielding slope parameters of -0.14 and -0.34 for @xmath0 , 0.34 for @xmath3 , respectively . as it can be seen from the figure ,",
    "@xmath0-mesons are only weakly absorbed via inelastic channels as compared to the @xmath3-meson .",
    "the contribution of secondary production processes like @xmath23 could increase the number of observed @xmath0-mesons and thus distort the transparency ratio .",
    "the reproduced mesons via such processes should have relativ low kinetic energy . applying a cut on the kinetic energy of the meson it is possible to study the effect of the secondary production processes on the transparency ratio . in the fig .",

    "as discussed in @xcite , this cut suppresses meson production in secondary reactions by selecting mesons with higher kinetic energy .",
    "[ fig : ta ] shows that within errors this cut does not change the experimentally observed transparency ratios for the @xmath3-meson and @xmath0-meson while there is a significant difference for the @xmath2-meson . for the latter ,",
    "the transparency ratio has changed dramatically and shows a slope of -0.32 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ta ] ) which is quite different from the previous one ( slope -0.14 - the empty black squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : ta ] ) .",
    "for the @xmath2-meson secondary production processes appear to be more likely in the relevant photon energy range because of the larger available phase space due to its lower mass ( 547  mev / c@xmath28 ) compared to the @xmath3 ( 782  mev / c@xmath28 ) and @xmath0 ( 958  mev / c@xmath28 ) meson .",
    "cross sections for pion - induced reactions favor secondary production processes in case of the @xmath2-meson : 3 mb at @xmath29 750 mev / c in comparison to 2.5 mb at @xmath30 1.3 gev / c for the @xmath3-meson and 0.1 mb at @xmath29 1.5 gev / c for the @xmath0-meson , respectively @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath2-mesons may be slowed down by absorption of an initially produced @xmath2-meson which is then re - emitted with lower kinetic energy from a s@xmath31(1535 ) resonance . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : ta ] the @xmath0-meson shows a much weaker attenuation in normal nuclear matter than the @xmath3 and @xmath2-meson which exhibit a similarly strong absorption after suppressing secondary production effects in case of the @xmath2-meson .",
    "+ since the transparency ratios for @xmath0-mesons measured for several nuclei deviate sufficiently from unity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ta ] ) an extraction of the @xmath4 width in the nuclear medium is possible using the glauber model in the high energy eikonal approximation  @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in  @xcite that the glauber model provides a quite reliable tool to extract the @xmath32 inelastic cross section . according to  @xcite",

    "fitting this expression to the @xmath0 transparency ratio data an in - medium @xmath0n inelastic cross section of @xmath40 = ( 11.5@xmath411.6 ) mb is derived  @xcite .",
    "the in - medium width is then obtained from @xmath42 with @xmath43 in the laboratory , where the average @xmath0 recoil momentum is 1.05 gev / c .",
    "the resulting in - medium width of the @xmath0-meson is @xmath44 25 mev .",
