    "sis junction pair a provides a constant if output power during each voltage sweep resulting in a relative shift between the blue and the red trace in figure [ fig04](a ) and ( b ) and in an overall shift of both traces in figure [ fig04](b ) ( black arrow ) relative to the traces in figure [ fig04](a ) .",

    "the si membrane technology is a promising approach to realize a variety of sis mixers at frequencies up to , or exceeding , 1  thz .",
    "nbtin or other high gap superconducting materials will be necessary to provide almost lossless transport of the signals in these mixers .",
    "however , combining nb sis junctions with nbtin transmission lines will need to be done with care .",
    "quasiparticle trapping will result in heating of the nb electrodes of the sis junctions .",
    "the result is a reduction of actual gap frequency of the material @xcite and a reduced performance of the mixer .",
    "moreover , our work suggests a possibility to produce on - chip balanced heb mixers .",
    "some of the authors of this paper recently showed that single - ended heb devices can be reliably fabricated on @xmath123 m thin @xmath124 soi wafers and that beamlead technology can be used to hold the devices suspended inside the mixer block even at working frequencies as high as 2.5  thz @xcite . in a recent paper from the gard group ,",
    "the soi technology was proposed in order to realize a future balanced waveguide heb mixer for the rf band @xmath125  thz @xcite . at frequencies as high as",
    "e.g.  2  thz the question remains whether a waveguide branch - line coupler or a planar coupler is the more favorable technology to realize a balanced heb mixer . in a waveguide branch - line coupler the mixer chips have to be separately mounted which is a critical technological step",
    "however , it offers the opportunity to select matching pairs of devices .",
    "a planar coupler in normal metal technology , because of the high frequency , is fabricated with integrated mixer devices , but offers no possibility to counteract fabrication tolerances after device processing .",
    "to conclude , we have measured the uncorrected dsb receiver noise temperature of our device between 440  ghz and 495  ghz and obtain values ranging from 70  k to 130  k representing state - of - the - art performance .",
    "an inverse polarity bias for the two mixers does not change the performance of the device compared to an equal bias polarity for the two mixers , provided the sum and the difference port of the if hybrid is used , respectively .",
    "the noise rejection of the device is between 6  db and 18  db .",
    "noise added to the mixer s lo port can be directly measured in the if output power and does not significantly increase @xmath17 .",
    "the noise rejection mechanism is directly observable in the if output power as function of the bias voltage over the whole voltage range of the photon step .",
