    "the water molecule , h@xmath3o , is among the simplest chemical structures , yet the liquid phase of water is among the most complex liquids . many of its unique , vital for life properties , including the ability to establish complex hydrogen bonded structure  @xcite , are due to the complexity of electrostatic interactions .",
    "the ability of water to hydrate ions and biomolecules is crucial to biological functions ; detailed atomistic understanding of these functions is impossible without accurate description of the energetics of aqueous solvation ( hydration ) . given the very polar nature of water as a solvent , understanding key details of molecular hydration requires accurate and comprehensive experimental characterization of electrostatic properties of water molecule in liquid phase at microscopic level .",
    "this characterization is currently lacking : for example , even the value of the dipole moment of water molecule in liquid phase is still debated@xcite : the experimental range is from 2.7 to 3.2d ,  @xcite and higher multipole moments are not available from experiment at all",
    ".    experiments further lack consensus in quantifying the key characteristic of the asymmetry of water response to microscopic fields of solvated charges  the so called charge hydration asymmetry ( cha )  @xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig : kf ] .",
    "one of its earliest  @xcite known manifestations is the observed differences in hydration free energies of oppositely charged ions of similar size , _",
    "e.g. _ , the k@xmath0/f@xmath1 pair , fig .",
    "[ fig : kf ] ; completely unaccounted for in the linear response continuum framework  @xcite .",
    "these cha - related differences are larger than many relevant biomolecular energy scales , such as folding free energy of a typical protein .",
    "the cha effects are strong not only for the charged , but also for net neutral solvated structures  @xcite .",
    "absolute single - ion solvation free energies are conventionally deduced from experimental estimates of hydration enthalpies of ionic solutions via the born - haber cycle  @xcite using highly controversial estimation of absolute proton ( h@xmath0 ) hydration enthalpy .",
    "uncertainties of up to @xmath4 kcal / mol are reported that stem from various degrees  @xcite of extra - thermodynamic assumptions  @xcite or cluster ion solvation approximation  @xcite made in obtaining these estimates .",
    "furthermore , ion hydration free energy is directly affected by liquid - vapor and liquid - cavity surface ( interface ) potentials : every time a charge @xmath5 crosses such interface , the electrostatic energy of the charge changes by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electrostatic potential difference associated with a the interface .",
    "however , available experimental estimates of this elusive quantity can differ by a factor of five  @xcite ; there are fundamental difficulties associated with measuring and even interpreting  @xcite the water surface potential  @xcite .",
    "the net result of these , and possibly other problems , is an almost 300% variation between the four available comprehensive experimental data sets of ion hydration energies in the strength of the cha effect for k@xmath0/f@xmath1 pair , fig .",
    "[ fig : kf ] . at the same time , even uncertainties of the order of just several @xmath8 can have profound effect on the thermodynamics or kinetics of different phenomena where ion dehydration is involved , e.g. , membrane ion channel transport , ion binding to receptor proteins , etc .",
    "an accurate quantification of the inherent cha of water is therefore of paramount importance for accurate quantitative estimates in biology , chemistry , and physics .",
    "in contrast to ions , direct measurements of experimental hydration energies  @xcite of neutral solutes are relatively straightforward and very accurate , with errors within a fraction of kcal / mol .",
    "the two primary sources of error in the case of ionic solutes are completely eliminated in the case of net neutral solutes , @xmath9 .",
    "first , the contribution of the interface potential to the energy of the solute transfer is zero , @xmath10 .",
    "second , experimental hydration energy estimates of neutral molecules are typically obtained using calorimetric measurements of transfer free energy , which are free from empirical reference energies such as the proton hydration free energy needed in the case of ions .",
    "@xcite connection to computational models is also easy to make since the relationship between measured and computed hydration energies is straightforward for neutral solutes  @xcite , in contrast to ions , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed overview of the associated issues .",
    "we therefore propose to quantify the cha effect by utilizing experimental hydration energies of small neutral molecules , rather than ions .",
    "specifically , we identify  cha - conjugate \" pairs of anion - like and cation - like neutral polar molecules that behave just like the k@xmath0/f@xmath1 pair with respect to charge hydration asymmetry . to characterize the asymmetry of water response to microscopic charge independently of the strength of the charge probe ( absolute hydration energies of small neutral molecules are much smaller than those of ions ) in what follows we will quantify the strength of the cha effect by a dimensionless quantity @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the average hydration energy of the pair of solutes , fig .",
    "[ fig : kf ] .",
    "without loss of generality , the hydration free energy , @xmath13 , of a molecule can be decomposed into symmetric , @xmath14 , and asymmetric , @xmath15 , parts with respect to inversion of solute charges : @xmath16 ; such that upon sign inversion of the partial atomic charges @xmath14 remains invariant , whereas @xmath17 .",
    "physically , the proposed symmetric - asymmetric decomposition of the solvation free energy reflects the inherently charge - asymmetric microscopic response of water to perturbing electric field due to a solvated charge .",
    "here , @xmath15 part accumulates all the deviations from the symmetric response @xmath14 that is invariant upon inversion of the perturbing electric field ; the response due to dipole polarization of water contributes primarily to the polar part of @xmath14 .",
    "the non - polar component of @xmath13 for molecules is also mostly symmetric  @xcite , and is similar in magnitude for molecules of similar size .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath15 relative to @xmath14 characterizes charge asymmetry of the solvent response : _",
    "e.g. _ in a hypothetical water consisting of molecules with a perfectly tetrahedral charge distribution this asymmetric response is zero@xcite .    for an arbitrary pair ( a",
    ", b ) of molecules , the experimental difference in their hydration energies @xmath18 would contain a mix of cha - related and unrelated components .",
    "here we propose to cleanly isolate the asymmetric part by identifying special pairs of `` cha - conjugate '' neutral molecules ",
    "molecules with same @xmath19 , but equal and opposite @xmath15 ; for these special pairs @xmath14 would cancel out in the difference , while @xmath20 would combine , so that @xmath21 would contain only the cha effect we seek to quantify .",
    "since no known experimental method can perform the decomposition of the total solvation energy into charge - symmetric and asymmetric parts , we must resort to theoretical water models to identify such special pairs of molecules .",
    "however , once such a pair is identified , the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 for each molecule in the a / b pair can be extracted from the experimental hydration energies ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the implications of the decomposition for development of simplified water models will be discussed below .        within the widely used family of tipnp water models  @xcite , the propensity to cause cha increases  @xcite progressively from tip5p to tip3p@xcite to tip4p - ew@xcite .",
    "in contrast , one of the earliest water models , bns@xcite , does not exhibit any cha : due to its perfectly tetrahedral geometry , charge inversion within this molecule can be emulated by a set of rotations around its oxygen center  a sufficient condition for the absence of cha  @xcite .",
    "this high degree of charge inversion symmetry is progressively broken in other water models shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : watmod ] by an order parameter @xmath24 that has an intuitive geometric interpretation .",
    "a relation between @xmath24 ( geometry ) and cha ( energy ) is established in si , where it is shown that @xmath25  the cubic octupole moment of water molecule earlier recognized  @xcite as key for breaking the charge hydration symmetry .",
    "this multipole moment is defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the components of the traceless octupole tensor of a water molecule model in the cartesian frame with origin at the water oxygen center and oh bonds in the @xmath28 plane with @xmath29-axis bisecting the h  o  h bond angle .",
    "the asymmetric part of the solvation free energy , @xmath15 can be treated as a first order perturbation ( with respect to the symmetry breaking variable @xmath24 ) to the completely charge - symmetric part , @xmath30 ; _ i.e. _ @xmath31 . for small @xmath24 , @xmath32 .",

    "this is due to a complex interplay between the self ( @xmath49 ) and the cross ( charge - charge interactions , @xmath50 ) contributions to cha within each molecules .",

    "it was shown that the different cha effects these models can produce are proportional to the values of their cubic octupole moments @xmath53 and thus to the different values of the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath24 inherent to these models .",

    "[ tab : eta0 ]    the physical meaning of the large , almost @xmath58 , experimental value of @xmath57 is that the intrinsic charge - asymmetric response of water to microscopic charges ( atomic size cha perturbations ) is strong , comparable to the charge hydration energy itself .",

    "in fact , the asymmetry of the individual perturbation caused by a single `` cha - dominant '' atom is even stronger , as the net cha effect in a pair of molecules measured by @xmath57 can be attenuated somewhat by the opposing contributions from other charges , see fig .",
    "[ fig : efld ] and si .",
    "we again stress that the @xmath57 from table  [ tab : eta0 ] are free of the issues related to the fundamental or technical difficulties  @xcite associated with the ion hydration asymmetry : @xmath57 inferred from cha - conjugate pairs of neutral polar molecules directly and accurately characterize the intrinsic asymmetry of the water response to microscopic electric field .",
    "as expected , the uncertainty in the experimental @xmath57 is small , about 2 % , as seen from the difference between the two cha - conjugate pairs .",

    "[ fig : watmod ] .",
    "judging by the ability of each water model in table  [ tab : eta ] to predict the experimental @xmath57 , we conclude that to the extent that the charge distribution of a real water molecule in liquid water can be approximated by three point charges , the distribution might be close to the recently proposed water model opc  @xcite , fig .

    "fig : opc ] .",
    "[ tab : eta ]    this new water model is , perhaps , the very first attempt to explicitly consider the cha effect in water model optimization  @xcite ; the model is curiously successful in accurately reproducing most properties of liquid water  @xcite .",
    "importantly , the accuracy of the predicted small molecule hydration energies by the water models used in this study ( in table [ tab : eta ] ) correlates well with their ability to reproduce experimental cha .",
    "namely , rms errors against experiment in hydration free energy estimates for tip5p , tip3p , tip4p - ew and opc are , respectively : 1.85 , 1.10 , 1.14 , and 0.97 kcal / mol ( based on 20 neutral molecules , see computational methods , chosen  @xcite to span the entire hydration energy range of the set of 504 neutral molecules ) .",
    "the correlation suggests that the highly accurate experimental @xmath57 for the cha - conjugate pairs of neutral small molecules can be used to calibrate and improve water models , especially their ability to accurately describe microscopic electrostatic effects important for molecular hydration .",
    "the relative quantity @xmath57 is expected to be insensitive to parameters describing the molecules in `` cha - conjugate '' pair ( such as the specific parametrization of atomic partial charges ) meaning that predicted @xmath57 mostly characterizes propensity of the water model to cause cha .",
    "this propensity is strong , consistent with the large value of the charge - inversion symmetry breaking separation @xmath24 , fig .",
    "[ fig : watmod ] , comparable to the positive - negative charge separation in water models that approximate the experimental cha reasonably well , table  [ tab : eta ] .",
    "the cha strength is also consistent with a relatively large value of the @xmath53 octupole moment of water molecule in liquid phase predicted by several independent quantum mechanical estimates@xcite .",
    "as we have noted before , for each cha - conjugate molecule pair one can extract @xmath14 directly from the experimental hydration free energies , which is essentially the average hydration energy of the pair .",
    "this quantity can also be used to assess the quality of water models with respect to their ability to describe the symmetric response to solvated charge .",
    "for example , for the pairs in table  [ tab : eta ] , opc water model gives the best agreement @xmath61 -7.3 kcal / mol for each pairs , vs. the experimental value of @xmath62 -8 kcal / mol ; @xmath14 for other water models tested here are less accurate , fig .",
    "[ fig : goodpairs ] . in the future , it would be interesting to test other water models , including polarizable ones , with respect to their ability to reproduce experimental @xmath57 and @xmath14 .",
    "we expect that for the current polarizable models , for which the polarizability is added at the dipole level  @xcite , one would observe similar @xmath57 to the corresponding non - polarizable `` base '' model to which the polarizability is added .",
    "this is because the dipole moment response is symmetric with respect to solute charge inversion .",
