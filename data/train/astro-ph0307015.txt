    "the size evolution of galaxies with redshift serves as an important constraint on models of galaxy evolution . in the current standard cosmology ( @xmath13=0.3 , @xmath14=0.7 ) , hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict a strong increase in the characteristic size of galaxies since z@xmath03 ( baugh et al .",

    "these objects are more compact than one would expect by assuming a fixed intrinsic physical size ( smail et al .",

    "frame wavelength raises the following question : are the galaxies selected ( lyman  break galaxies ) and the sizes measured ( uv sizes ) representative of the radial stellar mass distribution of the luminous high  z galaxy population ? put differently , is the radial extent of the instantaneous , relatively unobscured star formation , which is measured by the rest  frame far uv light , indicative of the radial extent of the stellar mass distribution ?    to properly test the model predictions one would ideally like to trace the size evolution of galaxies in the optical ( rather than uv ) rest  frame at every redshift .",

    "the srsic model is given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the central intensity and @xmath41 the effective radius , enclosing half of the flux from the model light profile .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 is a function of the radial shape parameter @xmath43  which defines the global curvature in the luminosity profile  and is obtained by solving the expression @xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are respectively the gamma function and the incomplete gamma function .",
    "the disks of spiral galaxies are also well described by a srsic model with n=1 , corresponding to an exponential profile .",
    "the srsic model ( with its free shape parameter @xmath43 ) is flexible enough to fit the radial profiles of nearly every galaxy type .",
    "for this reason and for its simplicity , we decided to use it for measuring the sizes of galaxies in our data .",

    "we checked that the estimate of the intrinsic ellipticity of our sources , and hence the conversion to circularized effective radius , was not systematically affected by the seeing , by searching for trends with z or the k@xmath30 apparent magnitude ( fig .",

    "the agreement between these two different algorithms ( @xmath068% of the galaxies have a size difference less than 35% ) corroborates the robustness of the size determination .",
    "one reason for this is that our very deep nir data allows us to sample the profiles out to approximately 2 effective radii , providing ample constraints for the fit .",
    "for the smallest objects , our bright total magnitude limit ( k@xmath30=23.5 ) has the effect that the measured sb profile extends over 5 magnitudes and is therefore very well characterized .",

    "the final sample is composed of 168 galaxies .",
    "the sizes of these galaxies are shown in table [ tabdata ] .",
    "one way to test the quality of our model fits is to compare the model magnitude with an aperture isophotal magnitude ( labb et al .",
    "2003 ) ( see fig . [ ktotkmod ] ) .",
    "the total luminosity , @xmath59 , associated with an @xmath38 profile extended to infinity can be written as @xmath60 as expected for an extrapolation to infinity , the total model magnitude is almost always equal or brighter than the model  independent determination . in general , there is relatively good agreement between the two measures : a magnitude difference @xmath40.2 mag for 75% of the sample .",
    "the difference between the two estimators is largest for objects with the highest n values , as expected because of the large amounts of light at large radii in these models ( trujillo , graham & caon , 2001 ) .",
    "galaxies , however , certainly do not extend to infinity and the model extrapolation is likely unphysical , especially for high - n values .",

    "the mean redshifts for the low / intermediate / high luminosity ( mass ) bins are 1.0 , 1.6 and 2.0 , respectively .",
    "these different sets measure evolution in a different luminosity ( mass ) range and a different redshift range , and splitting them helps to make this clear .",

    "the top row shows the evolution of the size distribution at a given luminosity . the mean size at a given luminosity changes significantly for luminous galaxies : at @xmath4l@xmath5@xmath6@xmath02@xmath710@xmath8h@xmath9l@xmath10 galaxies were typically three times smaller at z@xmath02.5 than now , and 4 times smaller for l@xmath5@xmath63@xmath710@xmath8h@xmath9l@xmath10 .",
    "a luminosity independent model ( @xmath94 and @xmath53 independent of l ) is less likely than our luminosity dependent model , justifying our choice of three subsamples .",
    "for the sizes at a given stellar mass the picture is qualitatively different : there is no evidence for significant evolution of the r@xmath77m@xmath11 relation , except for the most massive bin , m@xmath11@xmath63@xmath710@xmath8h@xmath9m@xmath10 . at @xmath4m@xmath11@xmath6@xmath02@xmath710@xmath8h@xmath9m@xmath10",

    "[ qratio ] , we visualize these results in a different way : we show the ratio between the present epoch mean size for every luminosity ( mass ) bin and the expected mean size as a function of redshift using the @xmath94 values derived from the fires data ( i.e. we show @xmath96@xmath97/@xmath96@xmath98=(1+z)@xmath99 ) . the same is done for the mass .",

    "z galaxies differ only slightly in size at a given mass from the present  epoch . in the middle luminosity ( mass )",
    "bin the evolution with z appears to be less important .",
    "for the l@xmath5r@xmath77 relations the dispersion of the high  z population increases in all the cases .",
    "this increase is , however , relatively moderate ( a factor of 1.22 . ) .",
    "we discuss how we can understand these results in the following section .",
    "using the observed nearby sdss size relations ( shen et al . 2003 ) as the correct local references , the observed fires size ",
    "luminosity and mass  size distributions at high  z show a very different degree of evolution . the mass  size relation has remained practically unchanged whereas , the size ",
    "luminosity has evolved significantly : there are many more compact luminous objects at high  z than now .",
    "how can we re  concile these two observational facts ?    in absence of m",
    "/ l evolution with time , a change in the size ",
    "luminosity relation with z would imply the same degree of evolution in the mass  size relation .",
    "however , the mean m / l ratio decreases with increasing z. in the nearby universe , most galaxies have large m / l ratios ( see fig .",
    "14 of kauffmann et al .",
    "in contrast , fires galaxies at z@xmath62 , at all luminosities , have m / l ratios of the order @xmath01 ( rudnick et al .",
    "consequently , although we observe a strong evolution in the luminosity  size relation , the decrease of m / l avoids a significant change in the observed mass  size relation .",
    "we can therefore characterize our observed high  z galaxy population as follows : small to medium size objects ( effective radius @xmath01.5 h@xmath23 kpc ) not very massive ( @xmath03@xmath710@xmath8h@xmath9m@xmath10 ) but often very luminous ( @xmath03@xmath710@xmath8h@xmath9l@xmath10 ) in the v  band .",
    "the above picture does not mean that large galaxies can not be found at high z ( labb et al .",
    "2003b ) , but that they are relatively rare .",
    "traditionally the high  z population has been selected by the lyman break selection technique ( steidel & hamilton 1993 ) known to select luminous unobscured star  forming galaxies .",
    "however , dust obscured or uv  faint galaxies may have been missed . the galaxies in fires",
    "are selected from very deep near infrared k@xmath30band imaging , and consequently , are expected to be less affected by this problem and give a more complete mass census of the high  z universe . in fact , the population of galaxies under study consists in part of a red population ( franx et al .",
    "2003 ) , which would be largely missed by the lyman break technique , but whose volume number density is estimated to be half that of lbgs at z@xmath03 .",
    "hierarchical models for structure formation in a @xmath100 dominated universe predict that lbgs have typical half  light radii of @xmath02 h@xmath23 kpc ( mo , mao & white 1999 ) in good agrement to the size of the galaxies we are measuring and to the observed sizes for lbgs of other authors ( giavalisco , steidel & macchetto 1996 , lowenthal et al .",
    "interestingly , other authors have observed lbgs using optical filters and , consequently , these sizes are uv sizes .",
    "the fact that their measures and ours ( which are in the optical rest  frame ) do not differ significantly could be evidence that the star formation of the lbgs is extended over the whole object .",
    "in fact , if we select in our sample those galaxies with l@xmath5@xmath62@xmath710@xmath8h@xmath9l@xmath10 and z@xmath62.5 , 1/2 of this subsample would be considered as lbgs following the madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) color criteria .",
    "we will explore the relation of uv and optical sizes in a forthcoming paper .",
    "`` high  redshift disks are predicted to be small and dense , and could plausibly merge together to form the observed population of elliptical galaxies '' ( mo , mau & white 1998 ) .",
    "we have made a simplistic comparison between the above prediction and our data in fig .",
    "[ momau ] .",
    "the lines represent the expected internal mass density m / r@xmath101 of disks galaxies just formed at each redshift for three different values of the specific angular momentum .",

( 1998 ) and assume a constant fraction of the mass of the halo which settles into the disk , m@xmath102=0.05 , and a constant spin parameter of the halo @xmath103=0.05 . with these two assumptions the internal mass density increases with @xmath57 as the square of the hubble constant @xmath104 .",
    "galaxies more massive than 10@xmath8m@xmath10 are observable over the complete range in redshift .",
    "the measured mean internal density for this galaxy population appears to evolve only slightly with @xmath57 , in agreement with the lack of strong evolution in the size  mass relation .",
    "if all the galaxies present in fig .",
    "[ momau ] were disks , their distribution would not be compatible with the theoretical expectation .",
    "however , we must take into account that we are observing a mix of galaxy types and not only disk galaxies . in order to address this point",
    "we have made a visual galaxy classification of all the objects with z@xmath41.5 and mass larger than 10@xmath8m@xmath10 .",
    "we can do that because of the high  resolution of the hst images in the i@xmath36band filter .",
    "this examination showed that the dense objects ( m / r@xmath10510@xmath8m@xmath10/kpc@xmath106 ) with z@xmath41.5 appear to be all ellipticals and that the late type fraction appears to increase as one moves to lower density objects .",
    "unfortunately , we can not make a similar analysis for z@xmath61.5 and the question of whether the high density objects we observe there are disk dominated remains unsolved .",
    "however , it is highly tempting to propose that our high @xmath57 dense population could be the progenitors of the nearby dense elliptical galaxies .    independently of the nature of the lbgs and of the red population",
    "it is clear that in order to reach the mass and sizes of the nearby galaxies an evolutionary process must be acting on the high  z population .",
    "recently , shen et al . have proposed , for the early  type galaxies , a simple model of mass and size evolution based on subsequent major mergers .",
    "this model explains the observed relations for these kind of galaxies between mass and size in the sdss data , i.e. r@xmath107m@xmath108 . in the shen",
    "picture two galaxies with the same mass ( m@xmath109=m@xmath110 ) and radius ( r@xmath109=r@xmath110 ) merge forming a new galaxy with mass m=2m@xmath109 and radius r=@xmath111r@xmath109 .",
    "if this process is repeated @xmath112 times : m=2@xmath113m@xmath109 and r=@xmath114r@xmath109 . if we take a galaxy at @xmath57=3 ( following our mass and size estimates ) with m@xmath109=3@xmath710@xmath8h@xmath9m@xmath10 and r@xmath109=1.5h@xmath23 kpc this implies that after 3 major mergers m=24@xmath710@xmath8h@xmath9m@xmath10 and r=4.8 h@xmath23 kpc , in excellent agreement to the values we see in nearby galaxies ( m=24@xmath710@xmath8h@xmath9m@xmath10 and r=5 h@xmath23 kpc , see fig .",
    "[ figsdss ] ) .",
