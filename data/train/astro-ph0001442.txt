    "the recent work of kovcs & jurcsik ( kovcs & jurcsik 1996 [ kj96 ] , 1997 [ kj97 ] , jurcsik 1998 [ j98 ] ) proposes an almost purely empirical method of extracting the absolute magnitudes , colors and effective temperatures ( ) and metallicities directly from the observed periods and light curves of rr lyrae stars .",
    "the only theoretical input appears in the transformation from m@xmath0 and v  k to l and  via kurucz s static model atmospheres .",
    "the very empirical nature and potential usefulness of the approach has attracted a great deal of attention from observers .",
    "the most recent work ( j98 ) compiles and analyzes a sizeable set of observational data of rr lyrae cluster variables and rr lyrae field stars .",
    "this study thus includes rr lyrae stars with metallicities ranging from z=0.00001 to almost solar z=0.020 .",
    "the end products of her analysis that we are most concerned about here are -  and -  plots , and the byproducts which are relations between luminosity l , mass m and metallicity z.    the j98 -  and -  data are shown in figure  1 as small dots , circles for rrab and triangles for rrc stars .",
    "the figures indicate well defined slopes for the fundamental and overtone blue edges and red edges , all four of which have approximately the same values , although there may be a slight broadening of the instability strip with luminosity .",
    "hereafter we call this slope @xmath1 ( @xmath2  / @xmath3  ) .",
    "j98 pointed out that no model calculations can explain the strong dependence of the temperature on the luminosity . in ",
    "2 we first confirm that indeed the slope @xmath1 of this empirical  diagram is in irreconcilable disagreement with that of radiative models . next , in  3",
    "we show that the inclusion of turbulent convection in the models only shifts the  line , but does not change the slope .",
    "the discrepancy is therefore very basic because it is already inherent in models that are as fundamental as purely radiative ones . in ",
    "4 we reexamine the uncertainties of both radiative and turbulent model calculations and conclude that the theoretical @xmath1 is very robust and can not be changed very much without introducing new physics . in  5 we discuss the theory that goes into the empirical relations of jurcsik , in particular the influence of the use of the static kurucz color  temperature transformation .",
    "we conclude in  6 .",
    "in the following we examine how well rr lyrae models agree with the j98 data .",
    "we first examine radiative models , and thus limit ourselves to the vicinity of the blue edges .",

    "[ fig1 ]    figure  1 shows a -  plot on the left . on these we superpose",
    "the linear fundamental and first overtone blue edges of radiative rr lyrae models .",
    "we recall here that among the linear edges of the instability strip only the overtone linear blue edge and the fundamental linear red edge coincide with the observable edges of the instability strip .",
    "nonlinear dynamical effects shift the observable fundamental blue edge and the overtone red edge to the red and to the blue , respectively , compared to their corresponding linear edges , by up to several 100k ( buchler 2000 ) . strictly speaking , for radiative models ,",
    "it is only the linear overtone blue edge that is relevant , but the linear fundamental blue edge can give a rough indication of the slope @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the red edges are determined by convection , and radiative red edges are not relevant and are therefore not shown in fig .  1 .    the solid lines have been computed for models with m=0.65 , x=0.75 and z=0.001 .",
    "the dotted lines represent models with m and z from jurcsik s \\{l , m , z } relations , the dashed lines those with m from jurcsik , but with z=0.001 . finally , the large open circles are models from tuggle and iben ( 1972 ) for m=0.6 and z=0.001 ( with the old los alamos opacities ) .",
    "they have essentially the same @xmath1 as ours which are computed with the opal opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) merged with the low temperature alexander - ferguson ( 1994 ) opacities .    again , because we are computing radiative models we do not expect the location of the blue edge to be in perfect agreement with the edge of the instability strip , but we note a very large discrepancy in the slope @xmath1 .",
    "figure  1 also displays a    plot on the right .",
    "only the slope of the constant mass models is in almost acceptable agreement with the j98 data , but those calculated with the j98 @xmath4 are in strong disagreement .",
    "in figures  2 we display again a    plot which shows the effect of composition on the location of the linear blue edges .",
    "the ( radiative ) models were computed with m=0.65 . here",
    "the solid lines have x=0.75 , z=0.001 , the dotted lines have x=0.75 , z=0.004 and the dashed lines have x=0.70 , z=0.001 .",
    "the location of the blue edge displays very little sensitivity to either metallicity z or helium content y , within a reasonable range of values . adjusting the helium content or metallicity",
    "does not provide a resolution of the slope discrepancy .",
    "we describe further tests in  4 .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that purely radiative rr lyrae models are in severe disagreement with jurcsik s -  data .",
    "the addition of time - dependent turbulent convection in the models has led to some spectacular successes compared to radiative models , in particular , in finally predicting double mode behavior both in rr lyrae ( feuchtinger 1998 ) and in cepheids ( kollth , beaulieu , buchler & yecko 1998 ) .",
    "one would hope therefore that the inclusion of turbulent convection might also remove the discrepancy between observations and theory described in the previous section .    yet , in that respect all of our modelling efforts with turbulent convection have proved in vain , despite the flexibility afforded by the 8 free order unity ( @xmath5 ) parameters that the turbulent convective equations contain ( yecko , kollth & buchler 1997 , buchler & kollth 2000 ) .",
    "we find that turbulent convection can shift the blue edges , but can not produce the differential effect with respect to luminosity that is required to give the right slope @xmath1 in the  plots . in figure  3 we show the results for three different combinations of these parameters .",
    "we note that different codes and slightly different recipes for convection give essentially the same theoretical slopes .",
    "for example , even though no linear models are computed , the nonlinear hydrodynamical models of bono ( 1997 ) indicate a similarly steeper slope than that of j98 .",
    "in this section we discuss the effects of several of the approximations that are inherent in the numerical modeling to see how robust the theoretical -  slope is .",
    "our code uses as equation of state a simple iteration of the saha equations ( e.g. stellingwerf 1982 ) .",
    "this equation of state is very similar to the opal ( rogers 1996 ) and the mhd ( dppen 1988 ) equations of state and we do not believe that the tiny differences can be responsible for the discrepancy between the models and the j98 data .      our radiative code uses a standard equilibrium diffusion approximation for the radiative transport ,    @xmath6    in which one uses for the opacity @xmath7 the rosseland mean ( mihalas & mihalas 1984 ) . eq .",
    "[ l_eq ] has several shortcomings in the region above the photosphere .",
    "first , it implies an eddington factor of @xmath8 , which is not correct in the optically thin outer region where @xmath9 approaches 0.40.5 ( feuchtinger & dorfi 1994 , fig .  3 ) .",
    "second , in this regime , the opacities should be higher than those given by the rosseland mean ( alexander & ferguson 1994 ) .",
    "finally , for the computation of the periods and growth rates it would be more appropriate to linearize the radiation hydrodynamics equations rather than the equilibrium diffusion equation .",
    "the magnitude of the errors introduced by the first effect can easily be estimated .",
    "one can approximate the effect of the eddington factor in eq .",
    "[ l_eq ] . by replacing @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "the eddington factor also appears in the radiation pressure which becomes @xmath12 .",
    "we can disregard sphericity effects in the momentum equation contained in the term @xmath13 .    to simulate the effect of an increasing @xmath9",
    "we assume that for @xmath14 , @xmath9 increases smoothly from 1/3 to 1/2 with decreasing temperature .",
    "the results confirm our hunch that an increase of @xmath9 in the very outer region has very little influence on the growth rates and almost none on the periods .",
    "more importantly it has no differential sensitivity to luminosity .",

    "[ fig4 ] 0.5 cm    we have artificially , and somewhat arbitrarily , increased the opacity from the vicinity of  outward .",
    "we have not found an appreciable differential effect with , and have therefore not pursued this avenue with more detailed modelling .",
    "finally , the insensitivity of the slope to @xmath9 makes us believe that the linearization of the radiation hydrodynamics equations instead of the common equilibrium diffusion equation ( requiring a serious coding effort ) would also make little difference .",
    "we conclude that the discrepancy between the models and the observations is not due to an inadequate treatment of the radiation transport",
    ".      could compositional make - up be more important than expected ?",
    "we have computed a number of rr lyrae models with various combinations of y and z , but find that the effect on @xmath1 is negligible .",
    "next we have artificially increased the abundances of the easily ionizable light elements such as mg and na in the opal opacities .",
    "again this has such a negligible effect on @xmath1 that the inclusion of this data would unnecessarily clutter figure  2 .",
    "an inhomogeneous composition is unlikely to exist in rr lyrae envelopes because of convection , but even if existed our tests with various changes in composition make us doubt that it would resolve the discrepancy .",
    "could rotation be responsible for the discrepancy ? in order to estimate the magnitude of the effect of rotation we have included a spherical pseudo - centrifugal acceleration @xmath15 in the equilibrium model and in the computation of the periods and growth rates .",
    "we find that a rather short rotation period , of order of a few days , would be necessary to have an impact .",
    "furthermore the disagreement is worsened by rotation because the slope steepens .",
    "we conclude that moderate rotation rates can not be the cause of the discrepancy .",
    "the blueward moving evolutionary paths turn around at some  and then move upward ( dorman 1992 , lee , demarque & zinn 1990 ) . if this happened inside the linear instability strip , then the leftmost blue edge , that of the overtone mode , would be defined by the topology of these paths , rather than by the pulsational stability of the models .",
    "however , the fact that the jurcsik blue and red edges of the fundamental and the overtone are all essentially parallel eliminates this possibility as an explanation for the shallow observed slope .",
    "moreover , for some of the clusters , full photometry of the horizontal branch exists , and there is no indication of any gap next to the rr lyrae region .",
    "clearly there are stars next to the empirical red edge for which the amplitude ( if not zero ) is less than the observational limit .",
    "the theoretical @xmath1 slope is very robust with respect to the uncertainties or approximations inherent in our code , but is in disagreement with the jurcsik empirical relations .",
    "we have therefore been led to reexamine the latter for their robustness , especially since they also make use of some theory , color to temperature transformation .",
    "because of the strong disagreement between jurcsik s processed observational data and the predictions from something as basic as radiative models , it is worth while to reexamine some of the most uncertain points in the reduction of the observational data .",
    "the observational material consists of rrab periods and lightcurves .",

    "we note that the same slope discrepancy is implicit in older and more recent independent calculations ( tuggle & iben 1972 , bono 1997 ) .",
    "the derivation of the empirical relations makes use of a _ static _",
    "kurucz color -  transformation . by computing the behavior of color versus temperature over the pulsation cycle",
    "we have shown that the use of static envelopes is in fact a very good approximation , and therefore can not be the culprit .",
    "finally , the shape of the evolutionary tracks , through their potential avoidance of certain regions of the instability strip can not be responsible either .    at this time",
