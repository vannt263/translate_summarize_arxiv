    "at the time of writing ( december 2000 ) , there are @xmath3 confirmed or candidate multiply - imaged extragalactic sources .",
    "all these systems except possibly for b2114 + 022 appear to have lensing object(s ) at a single redshift , although various astrophysical perturbations may exist at different redshifts ( keeton , kochanek & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "the lens candidate system b2114 + 022 was found by augusto et al .",
    "( 2000 ; hereafter a00 ) as the sixth strong lens candidate in the jodrell - vla astrometric survey ( jvas ) which along with the follow - up cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ) discovered 19 new lenses or lens candidates ( e.g.  browne 2000 ) .",
    "the field of the jvas system b2114 + 022 includes two early type galaxies at different redshifts ( @xmath4 and 0.5883 ) separated by @xmath5 , and four radio sources two of which are separated by @xmath6 enclosing the two galaxies within the diameter .",
    "these two widest separated components ( a and d ) have similar radio imaging and spectral properties and are most likely to be lensed images , while the other two components are open to several alternative astrophysical origins possibly including lensing , based upon presently available data ( see a00 ) . in this paper , we consider a realistic two plane lens model for b2114 + 022  a ,  d.    the basic equations of multiple plane lensing are well known , and can be derived elegantly from fermat s principle ( blandford & narayan 1986 ; kovner 1987 ) . in general , the properties of multiple plane lensing are much more complicated than those of single plane lensing , although some single - plane theories remain valid in the case of multiple plane lenses ( seitz & schneider 1992 ) .",
    "due in part to this complexity , only relatively simple two - plane deflectors have been studied so far .",
    "erdl & schneider ( 1993 ) gave a complete classification of the critical curves and caustics for two point lenses distributed in different planes , while kochanek & apostolakis ( 1988 ) investigated the lensing properties of two spherical deflectors at different redshifts .",
    "the properties of two plane lensing by elliptical deflectors ( e.g.  caustic properties ) are essentially unknown .",
    "this paper is in part an investigation of the properties of two plane lensing by elliptical deflectors as example models of b2114 + 022 .",
    "kochanek & apostolakis ( 1988 ) , using the above model , predicts that 110 per cent of gravitational lenses should be two plane lenses .",
    "this theoretical prediction is broadly consistent with the statistics of the well - defined , complete class survey , i.e. one two - plane lens candidate out of @xmath7 .",
    "the fact that no additional two plane lens was discovered in the rest of @xmath8 more heterogeneous lenses hints that other ( less well - defined ) surveys may be biased against the discovery of multiple plane lenses .",
    "nevertheless , as the number of observed lenses increases rapidly , we expect that more two plane lenses will be discovered in the future allowing us to use them for astrophysical applications ( e.g.  galactic structures and evolution , constraining cosmological parameters ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we briefly review the theory of two plane lensing and summarize the equations . in section  3 ,",
    "we investigate possible lens models of b2114 + 022  a ,  d , with particular emphasis on the differences between the properties of a single - plane lens model and a two - plane lens model .",
    "in section  4 , we discuss our results and point out directions for future work .",
    "in this section , we review the theory of two plane lensing . for further review , the reader is referred to the monograph by schneider , ehlers & falco ( 1992 ) .",
    "let @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 be the physical vectors from a fiducial perpendicular line on the foreground lens , background lens and source planes , respectively ( figure  1 ) .",

    "the impact vector ( @xmath9 ) on the foreground lens plane is related to the physical source vector ( @xmath11 ) and the impact vector ( @xmath10 ) on the background lens plane by the following two plane and single plane lens equations : @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the above all the distances are angular diameter distances . as for the single plane lens case , it is convenient to re - scale the physical vectors by length units in proportion to the angular diameter distances to the three planes from the observer , i.e. , by @xmath16 ( an arbitrary length ) , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; in other words , we define @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( e.g.  for @xmath22 , they become angle vectors ) . using these dimensionless scaled quantities , the lens equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) become @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 are scaled dimensionless deflection angles , and @xmath26 in equation ( 5 ) the dimensionless potentials are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 here @xmath29 are physical surface mass densities , and @xmath30 are critical surface mass densities defined by @xmath31 similarly to the single plane lens case .",

    "a full description of observed properties of b2114 + 022 is given in a00 .",
    "below we only summarize the main properties and the observational constraints to be used in lens modelling .",
    "a field of b2114 + 022 can be found in figure  2 , which shows the geometric arrangements of the radio components and the galaxies based on present absolute and relative astrometries ( table  4 , a00 ) .",
    "( 17,17)(0,0 ) ( 0.,0 . )",
    "b2114 + 022 is one of few jvas / class systems whose astrophysical origins have not been well understood to date . as shown in figure  2 ,",
    "there are four radio sources located within @xmath6 of each other .",
    "the widest separated components a and d in b2114 + 022 are similar in their radio properties ; they are both compact and have similar radio spectra over a frequency range from @xmath37  =  1.515  ghz , while the other two components found close to g1 s optical centre and component a are more resolved and have spectral peaks at higher frequencies ( figures 2 and 3 , a00 ) . two optical galaxies ( see section  3.1.2 ) are found in the field with components a , b and c at the same side while only component d is at the opposite side .    the geometric arrangements of the galaxies with respect to the radio components and the radio imaging and spectral similarities between components a and d hint that components a and d may be counter images of a higher redshift radio source lensed by the potentials of the galaxies . based solely on the geometry of the system , it would be possible that three or all four radio components are lensed images of the same source .",
    "in such scenarios , however , the different radio imaging and spectral properties of components b and c compared to those of components a and d need to be explained via modifications of images through the passage of the galactic media of g1 .",
    "since such an explanation lacks observational evidence at present , modelling components b and c as lensed images is not motivated ( at present ) ; it will , however , be worthwhile to revisit the issue in the future with better radio data and/or alternative interpretations of the present data ( see section  4 ) .",
    "the lensing hypothesis for components a and d is further supported using the following simple lensing analysis .",
    "if the unknown redshift of component a is somewhat higher than that of g1 ( @xmath0 ) and g1 has a moderate velocity dispersion , it is required that component a has counter image(s ) because its impact parameter from g1 s centre is smaller than an einstein ring radius using a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model for g1 .",
    "for example , for a source redshift @xmath38 and a line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath39 km s@xmath40 , an sis einstein ring radius is larger than the impact parameter of component a at g1 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the flux ratio between components a and d is uncommon in single - plane double lenses , namely that component a ( which is closer to g1 ) is @xmath42 times brighter .",
    "this unusual flux ratio between components a and d should then be attributed to the combined effect of the two galaxies found in the field if they are lensed images .    unlike components",
    "a and d , components b and c are difficult to interpret in several ways ( see a00 for further discussion ) .",
    "first , components b and c are at the same side of g1 ( with a @xmath43 astrometric significance ) , which is difficult to reconcile with a possibility that they are double radio ejections from g1 .",
    "second , they have more extended image structures while their spectra peak at higher frequencies compared with the more compact components a and d. finally , both components b and c are within 05 of g1 , which is smaller than an einstein ring radius of g1 for a moderate velocity dispersion of g1 and an intermediate source redshift ( see above ) , and the angular separation between components b and c is @xmath44 , which is 7 times smaller than the separation between components a and d , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "this last point from the geometry of b2114 + 022 virtually rules out a possibility that components b and c are lensed images of an independent source due to the same potentials which are supposed to give rise to components a and d , although it would not be inconsistent with a possibility that they are counter images of components a and d.    deep hst optical / near infrared observations of b2114 + 022 have not resulted in any detection of optical counterparts of the radio components down to @xmath46 ( wfpc2 , f814w ) and @xmath47 ( nicmos , f160w ) .",
    "this may not be surprising for components b and c because of their proximity to g1 s centre .",
    "the apparent extreme faintness of components a and d at optical wavelengths may indicate that their source is a high redshift and/or an intrinsically faint object , such as a low luminosity radio galaxy .",
    "table  1 summarizes a00 s relative positions of radio components b , c and d and the two galaxies with respect to component a , and the flux density ratios of the radio components .",
    "these flux density ratios do not include a00 s 1.6  ghz data ( table  3 of a00 ) , at which the spectra of components b and c are already turned over while those of components a and d start to turn over ( see figure  3 of a00 ) .",
    "the flux ratio of d / a most relevant for this study is not significantly affected if 1.6  ghz data are included .",
    ".relative positions of radio and optical sources and radio flux density ratios .",
    "observations used are as follows .",
    "( 1 ) radio component positions : merlin 1.6 ghz , vlba 5.0 ghz , merlin+evn 1.6 ghz . ( 2 )",
    "radio component flux density ratios : vla 8.4 ghz , 15 ghz , merlin 5 ghz .",
    "( 3 ) relative positions of g1 with respect to radio component a : not i band + vla 8.4 ghz .",
    "( 4 ) relative positions of g2 with respect to g1 : nicmos h band . [ cols=\"^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the ranges given in the table are only for models with @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 in the grid . predicted lensing of g2 s light distribution by g1",
    "is shown in figure  5 : g1 s lensing on g2 leads to a stretching of g2 s light distribution by @xmath51 approximately along east - west .",
    "for an observed light ellipticity of @xmath52 ( figure  3 ) , a stretching of @xmath51 implies an intrinsic ellipticity of @xmath53 along east - west ( i.e.  @xmath54 along north - south ) . from the two isothermal galaxies model grid of figure  4a",
    ", we find that the required mass ellipticity of g2 is much higher than the inferred intrinsic light ellipticity of g2 , especially for models in which g1 s light and mass are aligned ( the hatched region in figure  4a ) [ while the required mass ellipticity of g1 is similar to or slightly higher than the light ellipticity of g1 ] .",
    "this could be taken as a model - dependent evidence for a significantly flattened dark matter halo for g2 , under the condition that g2 s radial mass profile is isothermal and g1 s light and mass are aligned [ this latter condition is likely to be valid ( see above in section  3.2 ) ] .",
    "conversely , the required high ellipticity of g2 could be taken as an argument for a shallower - than - isothermal profile for g2 , which we consider below .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that the two isothermal galaxies model imply a large difference between @xmath55 ratios of the two galaxies ( at least by a factor of @xmath56 ; see above ) .",
    "( 16,12)(0,0 ) ( -1.1,12 . )    the relatively high ellipticity of g2 required in the two isothermal galaxies model can be significantly reduced by making the radial profile of g2 somewhat shallower than isothermal . in this case",
    "the required ellipticity for g1 of an isothermal profile slightly increases .",
    "however , this increase in g1 s ellipticity can be avoided by making the radial profile of g1 slightly shallower than isothermal .",
    "similarly to the case in the single plane lens model considered in section 3.2.1 , for a significantly shallower - than - isothermal profile of g1 a theoretical image near g1 s centre becomes brighter than the observational limit , insensitive to the core radius of g1 .",
    "a model with @xmath57 and @xmath58 was calculated and relationships among parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be found in figure  4b . in this model , parameter @xmath62 [ equation ( 16 ) ] covers a wider range compared with the two isothermal galaxies model , including values implying g2 more massive than g1 .",
    "in particular , within the upper limits of @xmath62 , g2 could be twice as massive as g1 implying that both galaxies have similar @xmath55 ratios . as figure  4b shows , with the chosen radial profiles for the two galaxies , one can find a model in which model position angles and ellipticities for both g1 and g2 are not too different from those for the observed light distributions .",
    "the parameter values for such a model ( marked by a cross in figure  4b ) are given in table  2 ( model  2 ) .",
    "predicted lensing of g2 s light distribution by g1 is shown in figure  5 . in this model",
    "the amount of predicted stretching for g2 is @xmath63 , which implies an intrinsic light ellipticity of @xmath64 along north - south for @xmath52 .",
    "compared with the predictions of model  1 ( figure  4a ) , model  2 predicts somewhat weaker distortions . in model  2 ,",
    "the mass ellipticities are relatively low but slightly higher than their observed / inferred intrinsic light ellipticities and g1 s mass distribution is misaligned with g1 light ellipses by only @xmath65 .",
    "the critical curves and caustics for this model are shown in figure  6 .",
    "( 17,17)(0,0 ) ( -0.5,-3 . )",
    "in this paper , we have tested and analysed in detail the simplest and observationally most consistent lensing hypothesis for the jvas quadruple radio source b2114 + 022 , namely that the two widest separated , observationally similar radio components a and d of b2114 + 022 are lensed images of a background radio source due to the two galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "although we have tested other lensing scenarios ( in which all the four components or three components a , b and d are lensed images of a background source ) and find that they can be consistent with the geometry and radio flux density ratios , present independent evidence indicating that components b and c have different radio surface brightness distributions and radio spectra compared to components a and d did not justify detailed analyses of such scenarios .",
    "however , we will have to revisit those lensing scenarios in the future if new data and/or new interpretations of the present data warrant it .",
    "our study finds that the radio components a and d of b2114 + 022 can be successfully reproduced by astrophysically plausible two - plane models consistent with the observed properties of the galaxies .",
    "in particular , the unusual flux ratio , i.e. the image closer to the lensing galaxies being brighter , can be easily reproduced in our model .",
    "short radio jets in the north of component a core and those in the south of component d core ( see figure  2 of a00 ) are also consistent with our lens model prediction ; qualitatively , theoretical jets in the south of the radio core on the source plane can reproduce the jets , based upon our lens models",
    ". global vlbi observations of these jets in the near future will reveal more detail and provide more stringent constraints on lens models for b2114 + 022 .",
    "since the optical counterparts of the radio sources appear to be extremely faint and are close to the two lensing galaxies ( see section  3.1.1 ) , it will be an observational challenge to obtain optical spectra of the four components to spectroscopically verify the lensing hypothesis .",
    "however , our realistic model grid ( figure  4 ) predicts a range of time delays from @xmath66 @xmath67 days between the two components with component d leading component a. so if a future radio monitoring program could identify a correlated variability between these two components with a time delay , this would confirm the lensing hypothesis independently .",
    "a00 have found no significant variability for the radio sources to date .",
    "although there are at present only a small number of direct and indirect lensing constraints available for b2114 + 022 , the unique geometric arrangement of the system and the d / a flux ratio appear to allow us to probe galaxies mass profiles in terms of radial power - law slope and core radius .",
    "our study indicates that models adopting two isothermal mass profiles for the foreground ( g1 ) and background ( g2 ) galaxies potentially may not be a particularly good fit to some observed properties of b2114 + 022 .",
    "they require a relatively high mass ellipticity ( @xmath68 ) for g2 while the inferred intrinsic light distribution is nearly round ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "they also imply a much larger ( at least by a factor of @xmath56 ) @xmath55 ratio for g1 than for g2 , which could pose a potential problem for the model .",
    "these potentially problematic features of the two isothermal galaxies model , as we have shown in section  3.2.2 , can be avoided if a shallower - than - isothermal profile is adopted for g2 . however , definitive bounds could not be put on g2 s radial slope from lensing analyses of this system mainly because image splitting occurs with respect to g1 s centre than g2 s centre [ although the undeflected source position can be closer to g2 s centre than g1 s centre ( see figure  6 ) ] and as a result g2 s mass profile is less sensitive to lensing properties .",
    "likewise , no bound on the core radius of g2 can be put using a theoretical image closest to g2 which may or may not form . instead , whether bright theoretical images near g2 can form or not is controlled by a mass ratio between the two galaxies as illustrated in figure  4 . specifically , beyond the upper bound on @xmath62 , the smaller ellipse - like caustic in figure  6 grows to enclose the source , allowing two additional images near g2 to form .    unlike g2 s mass profile , however , definitive limits on g1 s radial power - law slope ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath70-dependent core radius",
    "can be put using a theoretical image forming near g1 s centre . as illustrated in figure  4b , for a relatively shallow radial profile of g1 a region of parameter space",
    "becomes excluded due to a predicted bright image near g1 whose brightness is insensitive to the core radius . as g1 s profile gets shallower ,",
    "this excluded region grows and a profile shallower than @xmath71 is virtually excluded for g1 since such a profile does not allow a realistic p.a . for g1 .",
    "in addition to this definitive lower limit on g1 s radial slope , a less strong but likely upper limit on g1 s radial slope is suggested from our study , namely that a profile significantly steeper than isothermal is not very likely since those profiles require mass ellipticities much higher than observed light ellipticities .",
    "thus , a most likely radial power - law slope for g1 is a relatively shallow profile just over the lower limit .",
    "it is remarkable that relatively strong bounds can be put on a radial power - law slope of g1 with only a few number of lensing constraints available for b2114 + 022 . for models outside the excluded parameter space regions ( figure  4 )",
    ", upper limits can be put on the core radius of g1 ( see table  2 ) . with more strong lensing constraints provided by global vlbi observations of the radio jets of b2114 + 022 a , d in the near future ,",
    "this system offers a good possibility of determining the mass profile of g1 either using a simple model such as equation ( 12 ) or a more realistic model such as a two - component model simulating g1 s luminous and dark mass components .",
    "we plan to address this in the future .",
    "one striking natural consequence of a two - plane lens system ( or , any system consisting of two close galaxies with different redshifts ) that we draw attention to in this paper is that the background galaxy s light distribution is substantially modified by the foreground galaxy .",
    "the lensing effects are intermediate between weak lensing and strong lensing and include apparent shift of the galaxy position , changes of position angle and ellipticity , and distortions of isophotes generating arc - like isophotes for outer parts of the optical galaxy . while modifications of position angle and ellipticity are not observationally identifiable lensed features ( since intrinsic position angle and ellipticity are not measurable ) , distorted arc - like isophotes are potentially observationally identifiable lensed features since they are unique to lensing .",
    "predictions on arc - like isophotes depend on the mass ratio between the two galaxies ( figure  5 )",
    ". it will be important to obtain deeper hst images to test these predictions .",
    "multi - colour images may be particularly useful since the foreground and background galaxies have different colours , and therefore it may be easier to identify systematic features in a colour map .",
    "once the predicted lensed features could be measured in the future , these would provide strong constraints on the potential of the foreground galaxy .",
    "although only one two - plane lens candidate has been discovered so far , we expect many such cases to be discovered in the future .",
    "in particular , ngst and ska will play crucial roles in identifying many two - plane lens systems in the optical ( barkana & loeb 2000 ) and radio respectively .",
    "the prediction that 110 per cent of lenses may be two - plane lenses by kochanek & apostolakis ( 1988 ) is based on simple spherical lenses , it would be important to revisit the problem using more realistic lens models ; we plan to address this question in a further work , with particular emphasis on how this fraction depends on cosmologies .",
    "this study shows that the caustics and critical curves of two elliptical deflectors at different redshifts are extremely complicated ( see figure  6 ) ; these caustics include regions that can produce 7 or 9 images ( with the central image strongly demagnified ) , similar to binary galaxies in single - plane lensing ( keeton , mao & witt 2000 ) .",
    "the effects of additional images and moderate changes in isophotal shapes can potentially provide strong constraints on lens model parameters and perhaps cosmological parameters as well . some of these effects were illustrated in this paper . in particular , the effects of additional images were used to put model - dependent limits on the mass ratio of the two galaxies ( see figure  4 ) and to limit the allowed range of the radial power - law slope of the foreground galaxy .",
    "this can be understood as follows . in the complicated caustic structure of the two plane lens",
    "( see figure  6 ) , the caustics close to the source are more sensitive to the change of some model parameters than in a simpler caustic structure lens .",
    "an idealized example further illustrates the potential power of two plane lenses as astrophysical tools .",
    "if we have two perfectly aligned galaxies at different redshifts lensing a distant source , the aligned background source will be imaged into two einstein rings while the background galaxy is imaged into a third ring .",
    "if we model the lensing galaxies as singular isothermal spheres , then there are only two velocity dispersions that parameterize the lenses , while we have three einstein ring size constraints .",
    "the one extra constraint can then be used to constrain other parameters such as cosmology .",
    "it will be very interesting to see in the near future whether two - plane lenses can be a robust tool for cosmological studies .",

    "<S> we test possible lensing scenarios of the jvas system b2114 + 022 , in which two galaxies at different redshifts ( `` g1 '' at @xmath0 and `` g2 '' at @xmath1 ) are found within 2 arcseconds of quadruple radio sources . for our investigation , </S>",
    "<S> we use possible lensing constraints derived from a wealth of data on the radio sources obtained with vla , merlin , vlba and evn as well as hst imaging data on the two galaxies , which are presented in augusto et al . in the present study , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on reproducing the widest separated , observationally similar radio components a and d as lensed images . </S>",
    "<S> we first treat g2 ( which is the more distant one from the geometric centre ) as a shear term , and then consider two plane lensing explicitly including g2 s potential at the @xmath2 plane as the first case of two plane lens modelling . </S>",
    "<S> our modelling results not only support the hypothesis that the system includes gravitationally lensed images of a higher redshift extragalactic object , but they also show that the explicit inclusion of g2 s potential at the second lens plane is necessary in order to fit the data with astrophysically plausible galaxy parameters . finally , we illustrate a natural consequence of a two - plane lens system , namely the prediction of distortion as well as shift and stretching of g2 s isophotes by g1 s potential , which can in principle be measured by subtracting out g1 s light distribution in a high s / n and good angular resolution image , especially a multi - colour one .    </S>",
