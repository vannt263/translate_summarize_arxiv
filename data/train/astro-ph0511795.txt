    "the population of gamma ray bursts ( grb ) presents a bimodal duration distribution ( koveliotu et al .",
    "1999 ) : short grbs ( s  grbs - lasting less than 2 s ) and and long grb ( l  grbs - lasting more than 2 s ) .",
    "further support to this bimodality comes from their different spectral properties with short grbs being harder than longer events ( tavani 1998 ; ghirlanda , ghisellini & celotti 2004 ) .",
    "one of the most accredited models associates short grbs to the coalescence and final merger of two compact objects in a binary system ( narayan , paczynski & piran 1992 ; ruffert 1997 ) .",
    "binary systems evolve on different timescales ( voss & tauris 2003 ) and a testable consequence of this model is that short grbs should be found preferentially in evolved ( early ) type galaxies .",

    "2005 ) whereas grb  050709 ( butler et al . 2005 ) was found to be associated with a blue dwarf galaxy at redshift @xmath8 ( covino et al .",
    "2005 , hjorth et al . 2005 )    a third interesting case is represented by grb  050509b ( hurkett et al . 2005 ) , whose afterglow was detected only in x ",
    "rays , was found to be spatially coincident with a giant elliptical galaxy at @xmath9 ( bloom et al .",
    "2005 ) belonging to the cluster of galaxies zwcl 1234.0 + 02916 at @xmath10 ( pedersen et al .",

    "the possibility of a correlation of grbs with clusters of galaxies has been debated in the past ( kolatt & piran 1996 , struble & rood 1997 ) by studying the direct and statistical association of batse bursts with optically selected abell clusters , and opposite conclusions were reached ( hurley et al . 1999 ; gorosabel & castro  tirado 1997 ) . in these studies , however , the population of bursts was not separated in short and long events .",
    "magliocchetti , ghirlanda & celotti ( 2003 , hereafter mgc03 ) found evidence for anisotropy in the distribution of short grbs and suggested that they might originate in galaxies distributed up to @xmath13 .",
    "tanvir et al .",
    "2005 found that at least a fraction between 5% and 25% of batse short grbs might be in the very local universe ( i.e. @xmath14 ) preferentially in early type galaxies .",
    "it has also been proposed that a fraction ( e.g. hurley et al . 2005 ) of short grbs might be the cosmological counterparts of the giant flares of soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgr ) .    in this letter we study the cross correlation between short grbs detected by batse and x  ray selected clusters of galaxies covering the entire sky ( @xmath1520@xmath16 above and below the galactic plane ) .",
    "we find that a positive correlation indeed exists between the two population of objects on small angular scales .",
    "we investigate if short grbs trace the cluster distribution and also test if they preferentially correlate with early type galaxies . in the following",

    "-0.8 true cm    in order to correlate the grb sample with a sample of clusters of galaxies with a sky coverage as wide as possible , we considered the reflex ( boehringer et al .",

    "2000 ) surveys .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "eso flux limited x  ray ( reflex ) galaxy cluster survey contains 449 clusters with a maximum redshift @xmath21 and it is flux limited to 3@xmath22 erg @xmath23 s@xmath24 in the [ 0.1 - 2.4 ] kev band .",
    "it covers the galactic latitudes @xmath25 and declination @xmath26 and it excludes @xmath27 324 deg@xmath28 of sky around the lmc and smc .",

    "it covers the galactic latitudes @xmath25 and declination @xmath32 .",
    "we are aware that the noras sample is only 82% complete with respect to the reflex survey and we tested our results for this difference ( sec .",
    "3 ) . in combining the two surveys , given the higher level of completeness of reflex , we cut noras at @xmath33 , to avoid superpositions , and to the same flux limit of reflex .",
    "we end up with 314 ( out of 484 ) noras clusters combined with the 449 reflex clusters ( open green and blue circles in fig .",
    "[ skydist ] , respectively ) .    since we do not have redshift measurements for the population of short grbs we have to rely on projected quantities .",
    "note that for the cross correlation analysis we have considered only the 283 ( out of 497 ) short grbs ( red filled circles in fig .",
    "[ skydist ] ) distributed at galactic latitudes @xmath25 and with positional accuracy @xmath34 .",
    "the latter selection limits the large uncertainties associated to the position of batse bursts ( see mgc03 and sec .",
    "the same selection applied to the sample of 1540 long bursts gives 973 events . in fig .",
    "[ skydist ] we report the final samples of short grbs ( filled circles ) and the two samples of clusters ( open symbols ) .",
    "the angular cross correlation @xmath2 represents the fractional increase , relative to a random distribution , of the probability per unit solid angle of finding objects separated by an angle @xmath35 .",
    "we computed @xmath2 for the 283 s ",
    "grb ( b ) and the 762 clusters ( c ) by counting the burst  cluster pairs ( bc ) at different angular separations @xmath35 . this is compared with the pairs found at the same angular scale @xmath35 between the burst sample and a random sample ( br ) of @xmath36 objects distributed uniformly in the same sky portion covered by the clusters samples .",
    "we use the hamilton estimator for the angular cross correlation function between short grbs and clusters ( hamilton 1993 ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the total number of pairs between the short burst sample and the random and cluster samples , respectively , and @xmath40 represents the number of pairs in the random sample .",
    "the errors on @xmath2 were derived with the bootstrap method ( see e.g. ling , frenk & barrow 1986 ) : a set of 100 bootstrap catalogs , each the same size as the data catalog , were randomly extracted from the grb catalog . the cross ",
    "correlation ( eq .  1 ) was computed for each bootstrap catalog and , for each @xmath35 , a set of normally distributed estimates of the correlation function is obtained .",
    "the variance around the mean represents the 1@xmath41 uncertainty on @xmath2 . in all our calculation we accounted for the batse sky exposure map ( chen & hakkila 1997 ) and for the sky exposure of the reflex and noras samples , which however are quite uniform . as already shown in fig .  1 of mgc03 , the typical positional error associated with short batse bursts is of few degrees and the distribution of positional uncertainties of short bursts is nearly flat up to @xmath42 while that of long grbs peaks at 1 - 2@xmath16",
    ". the large uncertainty in the positions of short grbs might affect the correlation results .",
    "following the same procedure adopted in mgc03 we tested how the cross - correlation signal changes by considering subsamples of short grbs with better positional determination ( i.e. @xmath43 ) and found results fully consistent with those presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "we find a positive @xmath1 correlation signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] - red filled circles ) on small angular scales ( i.e. @xmath44 ) between short grbs and clusters while no correlation is found between long grbs and clusters ( star symbols in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "given the incompletness of the noras cluster sample ( sec .",
    "2 ) , we checked our results by computing the cross correlation between s - grbs and the reflex and noras samples separately .",
    "although the signal has larger uncertainties due to the smaller number of objects in the individual samples , we still find a positive correlation signal on small angular scales , entirely compatible with the one obtained by considering the two samples together .",
    "to provide an insight on the findings of the previous section we have to compare our data with results available in the literature .",
    "we use the generalization of the limber equation developed by peebles ( 1974 ) and lilje & efstathiou ( 1988 ) , which relates the angular two - point cross - correlation function @xmath45 to the spatial one , @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the comoving coordinate , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are related by the expression ( which only holds in the small angle approximation , @xmath51  rad ) @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the number of clusters in the considered sample with distance between @xmath48 and @xmath54 and the selection function for a particular class of extragalactic sources @xmath55 is connected to their redshift distribution by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the area covered by the survey .",
    "note that the above equations have been obtained for a flat universe .    for our analysis",
    ", we chose to consider three different cases for the spatial cross - correlation function : ( i ) @xmath58 ( i.e. cross - correlation function coinciding with the auto - correlation function of clusters ) ; ( ii ) @xmath59 ( cross - correlation between clusters and early - type galaxies ) ; ( iii ) @xmath60 ( cross - correlation between clusters and late - type galaxies ) .",
    "as for the form of the cross - correlation function to be plugged into equation ( [ eq : limber ] ) , in ( i ) we have used @xmath61 , with @xmath62  mpc and @xmath63 , as derived from the analysis of the clustering properties of reflex clusters ( collins et al . 2000 ) , while for the other two cases ( ii , iii ) we have written @xmath64 , with @xmath65 the bias factor .",
    "this latter expression can be easily derived as , theoretically , the cross - correlation function of two populations of extragalactic sources can be expressed as @xmath66 , with @xmath67 autocorrelation function of the underlying dark matter ( see e.g. mo , peacock & xia , 1993 ) . under the assumption of scale - independence , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the r.m.s . of matter fluctuations on a scale @xmath70  mpc , and @xmath71",
    "can be obtained from measurements of the two - point autocorrelation function for a chosen class of sources as @xmath72 ^{0.5}$ ] , with @xmath73 ( peebles , 1980 ) .",
    "values for the correlation length @xmath74 and the slope @xmath75 for the populations of early - type and late - type galaxies have been taken from studies of the clustering properties of 2df galaxies ( madgwick et al . , 2003 ) and , for @xmath76 as the latest results from cmb data seem to indicate ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , we obtain @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 respectively for the bias factor of clusters , early - type and late - type galaxies .",
    "@xmath53 in equation ( [ eq : limber ] ) has been derived from the redshift distribution of reflex clusters .",
    "note that in this case we have also made the choice @xmath80 , i.e. we have assumed galaxies of both types to follow the redshift distribution of reflex clusters .",
    "this choice was forced by the lack of a statistically significant spectroscopic sample of galaxies of different type which probes their redshift evolution from the local universe up to @xmath81 , maximum redshift of the clusters analysed in this work .",
    "direct comparison with the data shows that the distribution of short - grbs ( red filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) does not trace that of clusters ( long dashed line in fig.[fig2 ] ) , i.e. there is not a strong correspondence between clusters and short - grbs , as not all short - grbs are found to reside in clusters . if one instead compares the results with the cluster - galaxies cross - correlation function ( solid and dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] respectively for early - type and late - type galaxies ) , a much better agreement is obtained .",
    "this implies that short - grbs exhibit similar clustering properties of `` normal '' galaxies , i.e. that they are present in these classes of sources .",
    "unfortunately , the size of the error - bars does not allow to discern between early - type and late - type galaxies , preventing to associate short - grbs with a particular class of galaxies .",
    "-0.3 true cm    -0.5 true cm    -0.3 true cm    -0.8 true cm    the local population of short bursts might be `` contaminated '' by a more distant ( i.e. @xmath82 ) and isotropic population of objects which reduces the correlation signal with clusters at @xmath83 . under this hypothesis",
    "we should expect the cross correlation signal to decrease when selecting sub ",
    "samples of clusters at lower redshifts .",
    "we tested for this possibility by cutting the reflex+noras cluster sample at different redshifts . at variance with what previously expected we find ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) a _ stronger _ correlation signal between s  grbs and the 420 clusters with @xmath84 than what found with the 693 clusters distributed out to @xmath85 or out to @xmath86 .",
    "we also tested for any dependence of the cross - correlation signal on the cluster luminosity . in order to do this",
    ", we have divided the reflex and noras cluster samples in two sub ",
    "samples by considering the median values of their x  ray luminosity distribution : @xmath87",
    "erg s@xmath24 and @xmath88 erg s@xmath24 for the noras and reflex surveys , respectively .",
    "this selection corresponds to have a roughly equal number of clusters ( @xmath27424 ) in the two luminosity samples . as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we find a higher signal with sub - luminous clsuters with respect to the signal found with more luminous clusters we also tried to apply both the luminosity and redshift cuts . with these combined cuts our results",
    "are strongly affected by the paucity of clusters in the more luminous bin ( e.g. only 78 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) which does not allow us to draw any conclusion . ] .",
    "since the cluster surveys considered in our work are both flux - limited , one has that in general more luminous sources will mainly be more local than sub - luminous ones .",
    "what the data then shows is that short - grbs might preferentially inhabit low - redshift ( @xmath91 ) systems .",
    "in fact , this evidence is furtherly strengthened by the comparison of our results with the angular cross - correlation function of clusters and galaxies , obtained as in equation ( [ eq : limber ] ) by applying a redshift cut @xmath92 .",
    "one can see ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) that there is a very good match between data and `` models '' .",
    "note that in this case the redshift distribution adopted for early - type and late - type galaxies has been taken in a self - consistent way from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( madgwick et al .",
    "2002 ) , complete at least up to @xmath93 .",
    "-0.3 true cm    -0.8 true cm    further evidence on the proximity of short - grbs can be obtained by comparing the projected auto - correlation function for this class of sources as obtained by mgc03 , with the autocorrelation function of both late - type and early - type galaxies evaluated in a fashion similar to equation ( [ eq : limber ] ) up to some maximum redshift @xmath94 .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the dotted ( long dashed ) line represents the autocorrelation function of late ( early ) type galaxies at @xmath84 . the solid ( dashed ) line is instead that for @xmath95 .",
    "this comparison with the data also seems to hint to short - grbs to be more local than @xmath96 , possibly being distributed only up to redshifts @xmath97 .",
    "again we note that , with the available data , it is not possible to discern if short - grbs are mainly hosted in early - type or late - type galaxies .",
    "better data ( probably samples of size about three - to - five times the one considered in this work ) are needed to draw more firm conclusions .    at face value ,",
    "these results point to short grbs to be local and preferentially associated to less dense environments ( i.e. , by extrapolation , normal galaxies ) rather than to those identified by the clusters themselves .",
    "this last conclusion is reached as less x - ray - luminous clusters are generally associated to less massive systems ( see e.g. borgani et al .",
    ", 2002 ) .",
    "a consequence of these results is that , given the average fluence ( integrated @xmath98 kev ) of 4.3@xmath99 erg @xmath100 s@xmath24 of our sample of short grbs , we estimate a typical isotropic equivalent energy of @xmath101 erg , by assuming @xmath97 .",
    "another consequence of having short grbs at lower redshift than previously thought is the increase of their rate as recently pointed out by guetta & piran 2005 , nakar et al .",
    "2005 and gal ",
    "yam et al .",
    "by cross correlating batse bursts and ( reflex + noras ) x  ray selected samples of clusters ( distributed out to @xmath102 ) we find that short duration ( @xmath103 s ) grbs are correlated with clusters while we do not find any correlation with the population of long grbs . by comparing the short grbs ",
    "cluster correlation signal with the cluster ",
    "cluster autocorrelation signal we can exclude that short bursts trace the cluster distribution . instead , through the comparison with the cluster ",
    "galaxy correlation functions we conclude that short grbs are associated to `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "we explored the hypothesis that short grbs are local events .",
    "in fact , we find a higher cross  correlation signal with low redshift clusters ( i.e. up to @xmath104 ) or with sub - luminous clusters .",
    "what furtherly supports our conclusion is ( i ) the similarity of the short grbs - clusters and local galaxies - clusters cross correlation and ( ii ) the short grbs auto - correlation , which is similar to the auto  correlation function of local ( @xmath1050.1 ) galaxies .",
    "the present statistics do not allow to exclusively associate short grbs with early  type galaxies as expected if they are produced - in the double compact merger scenario - by an old stellar population .",
    "these results represent a challenge because on one side they seem to contradict the , still very few , redshift measurements of short grbs which place them at @xmath8 ( grb  050709 - covino et al .",
    "2005 , hjorth et al . 2005 ) and @xmath106 ( grb  050724 - berger et al . 2005 ) and on the other side they predict a typical energy of @xmath107 erg for short grbs .",
    "the apparently different ( lower ) redshift of batse short bursts ( as found with our analysis , but see also tanvir et al .",
    "2005 ) with respect to the few swift measured redshifts might be due to one ( or to a combination ) of several effects : ( i ) an unknown bias of swift to detect systematically larger redshifts ( as also shown for the population of long grbs ) with respect to batse ; ( ii ) a possible contamination of the batse short burst population by extragalactic sgr ( as suggested by hurley et al .",
    "2005 ) , although direct positional searches ( nakar et al . 2005 ) and spectral analysis ( lazzati et al . 2005 ) hardly support this scenario ; ( iii ) a complex luminosity function ( e.g. guetta & piran 2005 ) . for these reasons",
    "the redshift distribution of short bursts still represents an open issue which needs more direct redshift determinations as well as a better understanding of the possible selection effects .",
