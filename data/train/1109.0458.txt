    "the electron bunches in high - gain free - electron lasers are longitudinally compressed to achieve peak currents in the ka range which are necessary to drive the fel gain process in the undulator magnets .",
    "bunch compression is accomplished by a two - stage process : first an _ energy chirp _ ( energy - position relationship ) is imprinted onto the typically 10ps long bunches emerging from the electron gun , and then the chirped bunches are passed through magnetic chicanes .",
    "magnetic compression of intense electron bunches is strongly affected by collective effects in the chicanes and can not be adequately described by linear beam transfer theory .",
    "space charge forces and coherent synchrotron radiation have a profound influence on the time profile and internal energy distribution of the compressed bunches .",
    "the collective effects have been studied by various numerical simulations ( see  @xcite and the references quoted therein ) but the parameter uncertainties are considerable and experimental data are thus indispensable for determining the longitudinal bunch structure . using a transverse deflecting microwave structure ( tds )  @xcite our group has carried out a time - resolved phase space tomography  @xcite of the compressed bunches in the free - electron laser flash .",
    "the tds converts the temporal profile of the electron bunch charge density into a transverse streak on a view screen by a rapidly varying electromagnetic field , analogous to the sawtooth voltage in a conventional oscilloscope tube .",
    "the time resolution depends on the microwave voltage and the beam optics in the diagnostic section . in the present beam optics configuration at flash , a resolution of down",
    "to 25fs rms has been achieved .",
    "the electro - optical ( eo ) technique is an alternative method of measuring the longitudial bunch charge distribution .",
    "several variants of single - shot eo bunch diagnostics have been applied  @xcite , all sharing the underlying principle of utilizing the field - induced birefringence in an electro - optic crystal to convert the time profile of a bunch into a temporal , spectral , or spatial intensity modulation of a probe laser pulse .",
    "the eo techniques have the advantage of being non - destructive , thereby permitting correlation studies of eo measurements on selected bunches with the fel radiation pulses produced by the same bunches . in ref .",
    "@xcite an absolute calibration of the eo technique was performed utilizing simultaneous tds measurements .",
    "a record resolution of 50fs ( rms ) in the detection of single electron bunches was achieved .",
    "frequency - domain techniques provide a complementary access to the femtosecond time regime .",
    "the spectral intensity of the coherent radiation emitted by a bunch with @xmath0 electrons is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the intensity per unit wavelength emitted by a single electron , and @xmath3 is the longitudinal form factor of the bunch , the fourier transform of the normalized line charge density @xmath4 : @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) we have made use of the fact that radiation from relativistic particles is confined to small angles whereby the influence of the transverse form factor is strongly suppressed . for an rms beam radius of 100 m to 200 m , as in our case , the determination of the longitudinal charge profile from the measured coherent radiation spectrum depends only weakly on the precise knowledge of the transverse charge distribution .",
    "a measurement of the coherent radiation spectrum yields the absolute magnitude of the form factor as a function of wavelength but the phase remains unknown .",
    "hence the determination of the longitudinal charge distribution by inverse fourier transformation is not directly possible .",
    "phase information can be obtained with the help of the kramers - kronig relation  @xcite if a sufficient wavelength range is covered .",
    "the typical lengths of compressed electron bunches of a few hundred micrometer leads to coherent emission in the far infrared ( fir ) and millimeter wavelength range .",
    "the commonly used technique of spectroscopy for this regime is to measure the autocorrelation function with a michelson type interferometer and to deduce the power spectrum by fourier transformation ( fourier - spectroscopy ) .",
    "this technique has been applied for bunch length measurements at various electron linacs  @xcite .",
    "since the interferometer is a step - scan device , it can not be used for online monitoring . for this , polychromators measuring different wavelengths simultaneously have been proposed  @xcite but were of limited use due to their small number of read - out channels and thus restricted wavelength range .",
    "we have developed a novel broadband spectroscopic instrument with single - shot capability  @xcite . with two sets of five consecutive gratings , which can be interchanged by remote control ,",
    "the most recent version of the spectrometer covers the far - infrared wavelength range from 45 to 435 m or the mid - infrared range from 5 to 44 m .",
    "the spectral intensity is recorded simultaneously in 120 wavelength bins .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the design of the spectrometer , the detectors , amplifiers and readout electronics .",
    "test measurements with coherent transition radiation ( ctr ) are presented which were carried out on bunches whose time profile was determined simultaneously using the transverse deflecting microwave structure tds .",
    "coherent radiation from short electron bunches extends over a wide range in wavelength , from a few micrometers up to about 1 mm .",
    "gratings are useful to disperse the polychromatic radiation into its spectral components . for a monochromatic plane wave that is incident normally on a transmission grating with slit spacing @xmath6 ,",
    "the transmitted wave has interference maxima at angles @xmath7 given by the equation @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the order of diffraction .",
    "the free spectral range of a grating is defined by the requirement that different diffraction orders do not overlap .",
    "since light of wavelength @xmath10 , diffracted in the order @xmath11 , will coincide with light of wavelength @xmath12 , diffracted in the order @xmath13 , the ratio of the longest and the shortest wavelength in the free spectral range is close to two .",
    "hence a single grating can only cover a small part of the entire coherent radiation spectrum , and many gratings of different spectral ranges have to be used simultaneously .",
    "ambiguities due to overlap of different orders are avoided if the radiation impinging on a grating is filtered to limit the bandwidth appropriately .",

    "for the first order @xmath11 this implies @xmath19 , hence @xmath20 . in this case most of the diffracted power goes into the order @xmath11 .",
    "it is a general feature of gratings that the diffraction effects vanish if the wavelength becomes too large .",

    "this implies that for wavelengths @xmath22 , the grating equation  ( [ grating - equation ] ) can only be satisfied with @xmath23 which means that no diffracted wave exists and the reflection grating behaves as a plane mirror .",
