    "the reason for this behavior is the competition between timescales related to rabi oscillation induced by local field between molecular levels and electronic escape rate from molecule into contacts ( @xmath108 ) . on the one hand , both negatively and positively chirped pulses in the middle have frequency approximately at resonance with homo - lumo transition , @xmath109 , which is a prerequisite to effective electron transfer and thus increase in pumped charge . on the other hand , at resonance rabi oscillations@xcite at high enough intensities",

    "note also , that with positively chirped pulse changing frequency from lower to higher transfered charge buildup is more effective at the start of the pulse ( at lower frequencies ) , while for negatively chirped pulse more effective buildup takes place at the end of the pulse ( compare solid and dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig3]b and [ fig5]b ) .",
    "contrary to buildup suppression in the middle of the pulse , this effect is due to molecule - contact hybridization .",

    "this compression is the cause of less charge pumped through the system in the former case , which results in decrease in @xmath112 in the region of @xmath39 from @xmath113 to @xmath114 fs@xmath36 . indeed , at the very low rates frequency of the pulse does not change much , so the asymmetry is solely due to difference in pulse length . at a higher rates",
    "an additional factor appears : the most effective contribution to charge transfer takes place at a particular region of frequencies ( at and just below resonance , as is discussed above ) .",
    "this region is passed quicker in the positively chirped local pulse , and in the region up to @xmath114  fs@xmath36 this results in increase of asymmetry , since negatively chirped pulse spends more time in its effective frequencies zone .",
    "further increase of chirp rate leads to decrease and almost disappearance of the asymmetry .",
    "the reason is decrease of ratio of the pulses difference to overall local pulse duration .",
    "coupling to electron - hole excitations not only diminishes pumped charge ( compare solid and dashed lines in panel a ) , but also decreases asymmetry ( panel b ) .",

    "eventually any frequency within the chirped pulse has roughly same effectiveness ",

    "this leads to a situations when most effective optical pumping does not correspond to zero bias , rather we see shallow peak at @xmath119v .",
    "explanation is related to the fact that broadened molecular levels are essentially a set of scattering channels with different transmission probabilities : high conducting channels are in the center of lorentzian , while channels in the sides of distribution are poor conductors .",
    "optical process takes electron from an occupied ground state and puts it into one of empty excited state .",
    "effectiveness of the charge pump is defined by increase or decrease of current through the junction under optical pulse ( see discussion in ref .  ) . in particular ,",
    "negative bias decreases effectiveness of the pump mostly due to blocking part of lumo-@xmath5 escape routes .",
    "positive bias opens additional escape routes at the tail of lumo lorentzian , facilitating increase in pump efficiency . however , additional effect of depleting homo and populating lumo partially blocks optically induced homo - lumo electron transfer , thus reducing overall effectiveness of optical pumping .",

    "the reason is similar to competition between rabi frequency and escape rate discussed above .",
    "indeed , with negative bias partially blocking fast escape route for the electron from excited state into right contact , rabi oscillation plays an important role at quasi - resonant situation in the middle of the pulse .",

    "the asymmetry depends on the incoming pulse chirp rate in a non - monotonic manner .",
    "junction response to optical driving is symmetric to both low and high chirp rates , going through a maximum between the two extremes .",
    "we find that this behavior is caused by the correspondence between pulse duration of the local field and detuning of its frequency at the end of the pulse from energy difference between molecular states ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "we note that at quasi - resonance charge pump becomes ineffective , due to the competition between intra - molecular rabi oscillation induced by the pulse with electron transfer from molecule to contact .",
    "increase of the molecule - contact coupling strength increases electron escape rate , thus reducing ineffectiveness of the pump due to rabi oscillations .",
    "also we study the effect of bias on optically - facilitated charge transfer through the junction .",
    "we find that in the non - markov situation ( i.e. when hybridization between molecule and contacts is non - negligible ) most effective charge pump regime is at finite positive bias , rather than at equilibrium as one may expect from markov consideration of ref .  .",
    "the effect comes from optically - assisted charge redistribution between low and high conducting scattering channels in broadened molecular states , as was discussed in our previous publication.@xcite within the model negative bias reduces ( positive increases ) excess charge pumping due to blocking ( facilitating ) outgoing scattering channels in the excited molecular state and thus increasing ( decreasing ) the role of intra - molecular rabi oscillations .    finally , direct electron - hole excitation in contacts , heating , and inelastic effects are examples of effects beyond current consideration which may also have a significant impact on the properties of a molecular charge pump .",
