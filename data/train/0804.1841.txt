    ", the temporal delay between the medium s response and the inductor gives rise to a classical dissipative frictional force .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the friction effect between a non stationary magnetic dipole moment and its induced quantum vacuum magnetic dipole moment . in this case the temporal delay between the vacuum s response and the inductor is due to the finite velocity of light .",
    "we calculate the friction energy loss rate in the case of highly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "pulsars are the more appropriate systems to look for such an effect .",
    "pulsars are fast rotating neutrons stars , with a very high magnetic dipole moment tilted with respect to their rotational axis  @xcite . typically , their mass is of the order of that of the sun , and their radius of the order of @xmath1 km .",
    "the magnetic field of neutron stars is typically of the order of @xmath2 t , while in the case of magnetars @xcite astrophysical observations seem to indicate that fields as high as @xmath3 t exist on their surface  @xcite .",
    "spinning periods of neutron stars range from tens of milliseconds for young stars to seconds , increasing with star age . because of their fast rotation retardation effects are significant .",
    "a rotating neutron star can thus be considered as a classical magnetic dipole moment weakly coupled to a bath , namely the quantum vacuum described by qed as electron - positron pairs due to quantum fluctuations . in a microscopic description ,",
    "the energy is dissipated via the polarization process and through the annihilation of the polarized pairs which relax this excess of energy to the bath .",
    "this excess of energy corresponds to the frictionnal energy we calculate using a classical interaction between the star s dipole moment and the bath .",
    "we show that , for neutron star with a very high magnetic field , that exceeds the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) critical field ( @xmath4 t ) , the energy loss is essentially due to qvf , while the energy loss due to the classical process as star rotating dipole radiation becomes negligible .",
    "this applies in particular to magnetars which associate a strong magnetic field and a few seconds spinning period . to infer the magnetic field of such stars one can not use the classical dipole energy loss formula .",
    "our results suggest that to characterize magnetars one needs to measure the energy loss rate and the magnetic field independently . taking into account qvf",
    ", we calculate the braking index  @xcite and show that its measurement can provide a non - model dependent determination of the magnetic field on the surface of a neutron star .",
    "to study the quantum vacuum magnetization in the presence of a magnetic field , we start with the effective heisenberg - euler lagrangian @xmath5 of the light - light interaction  @xcite . due to relativistic invariance , @xmath5 is a function of the lorentz invariants , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , given by  @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath10 the vacuum permeability .",

    "@xmath64    fig .",
    "[ f_qvf1 ] clearly shows that for fields exceeding the qed critical field the star energy loss is essentially due to qvf .    at this stage , it is important to stress that spinning period dependence is not the same for the classical case and for the qvf .",
    "the ratio of classical to qvf losses decreases like @xmath65 for large @xmath36 .",
    "qvf becomes more important for slowly rotating neutron stars .",
    "this result has important consequences .",
    "actually , the value of the magnetic field on the surface of a neutron star is inferred by the energy loss of the star , derived by the measured value of the spin - down rate , assuming that the energy loss of the star is given by classical dipole model . in a case for which qvf should play an important role , the inferred value of the magnetic field should then be modified .",
    "moreover , we see that the method used to get the value of the magnetic field , gives @xmath61 rather than @xmath30",
    ". one should thus assume the value of @xmath26 to get @xmath30 ( typically @xmath26 is taken equal to @xmath66 ) .",
    "in the following , taking advantage of the fact that this angular dependence is the same for @xmath55 and @xmath63 , we show that the inferred value of the magnetic field at the surface of a pulsar can be derived by the measurement of the star s braking index .",
    "the braking index @xmath67 , is a fundamental parameter of pulsar electrodynamics describing the rate at which a magnetized neutron star loses rotational energy .",
    "this dimensionless quantity is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the spinning frequency of the pulsar and @xmath70 ( respectively @xmath71 ) , denotes the first ( respectively the second ) derivative of @xmath69 with respect to time . from this definition",
    "one can see that the braking index can be determined from pulsar timing measurements without any assumption concerning the star s structure and so , provides a crucial information for our understanding of the physics underlying pulsar spin - down . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "the pulsar s rotational energy loss rate is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the moment of inertia of the rotating star .",
    "assuming a pure classical dipole energy loss mechanism , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq_edotcla ] ) : @xmath74 where @xmath75 . taking the logarithmic derivative of this equation , we find @xmath76 .",
    "so far , braking indices of only six pulsars have been precisely measured , all of which are remarkably smaller than the value @xmath77 expected for pure classical dipole radiation model ( see table  [ tab_1 ] , second column ) .",
    "this result clearly shows that an additionnal energy loss mechanism should be included in the model to fit the data .",
    "explanations of this discrepancy have already been suggested as for example the effect of the relativistic pulsar wind  @xcite or the fact that the pulsar s magnetism can not be modeled with a simple dipolar field  @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we do not discuss the validity of such assumptions but we propose instead qvf as an additionnal energy loss mechanism which can provides a new coherente explanation for all the values of braking index measured so far . taking into account qvf , eq .",

    "we show how the inferred value of the magnetic field @xmath85 can be obtained by matching the analytical expression given by eq .",

    "this last result can provide a very important test to confirm qvf predictions . because of the gamma - ray emitting electron - positron cascades which occur for @xmath90 above the threshold value of @xmath91  @xcite , magnetars , i.e pulsars with a magnetic field above the qed critical field ( within the classical dipolar model ) should not be gamma emitters . detecting a gamma - ray emission from such a system , for example by the nasa glast mission due to launch in 2008 , would provide an evidence in favor of qvf which leads to smaller values of the magnetic field for magnetars compatible with gamma - ray emission .    llccr + name & @xmath67 & @xmath69 & @xmath85 & @xmath86 + & & ( @xmath92 ) & ( @xmath93 g ) & ( @xmath93 g ) +   +   + j1846 - 0258 & 2.65(1 ) & 3.07 & 1.0 & 49 + b0531 + 21 & 2.51(1 ) & 30.2 & 12.4 & 3.8 + b1509 - 58 & 2.839(3 ) & 6.63 & 1.4 & 15 + j1119 - 6127 & 2.91(5 ) & 2.45 & 0.4 & 42 + b0540 - 69 & 2.140(9 ) & 19.8 & 12.4 & 5.1 + b0833 - 45 & 1.4(2 ) & 11.2 & 16.1 & 3.4 +",
