    "state transfer between different units of a quantum computer or entanglement distribution between two parties require quantum communication channels  @xcite .",
    "they are quantum systems transferring quantum information : the proper quantity to characterize the channel performance is the _ quantum capacity _ , defined as the maximum number of qubits that can be reliably transmitted per channel use  @xcite .    quantum channels are often thought as memoryless , implying that the effect of the channel on each information carrier is always described by the same map @xmath0 . in other terms",
    "there is no memory in the interaction between carriers and the environmental degrees of freedom physically describing the channel . in this case",
    "the quantum operation for @xmath1 channel uses is given by @xmath2 .",
    "however , in several physically relevant situations this is not a realistic assumption .",
    "memory effects appear when the characteristic time scales for the environment dynamics are comparable or longer than the time between consecutive channel uses . for instance , solid state implementations , which are the most promising for their scalability and integrability , suffer from low frequency noise  @xcite . in optical fibers ,",
    "memory effects may appear due to slow birefringence fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this introduces correlation among uses , then @xmath3 , this kind of channels being referred in the literature as _ memory channels _",
    "@xcite .    a very interesting question , raised for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite , is whether memory can _ enhance _ the transmission capacity of a quantum channel .",
    "recently we have considered a channel subject to dephasing noise described by a markov chain , showing that the quantum capacity increases with respect to memoryless limit  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore based on theoretical arguments and numerical simulations , we have conjectured that the enhancement of the quantum capacity also takes place for a dephasing quantum environment modelled by a bosonic bath  @xcite .",
    "this issue is also relevant for the performance of quantum error - correcting codes ( qeccs ) . since",
    "quantum capacity is the maximum rate of reliable quantum information transmission , it puts an upper bound to the asymptotic rate achievable by any qecc . on the other hand ,",
    "realistic qeccs necessarily work on a finite number of channel uses .",
    "moreover , present day experimental implementations  @xcite are bases on very few channel uses .",
    "previous studies have investigated the impact of correlations on the performance of qeccs  @xcite .",
    "depending on the chosen model , correlations may have positive or negative impact on qeccs . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we have shown , for a markovian dephasing channel , that also low values of memory , for which the quantum capacity does not change appreciably , can have a detrimental impact on the three - qubit code performance .    in this paper",
    "we describe a dephasing channel by a hamiltonian where the system environment interaction is modelled by a stochastic process .",
    "then we discuss the three - qubit code error performance in presence of channel correlations .",
    "we suppose that information is carried by qubits that transit across a communication channel , modelled as an environment determining pure dephasing of the qubits .",
    "the environment acts as a stochastic drive @xmath4 on the system and the hamiltonian describing the transmission of @xmath1 qubits through the channel reads @xmath5 the @xmath6th qubit is coupled to the environment via its pauli operator @xmath7 , with coupling strength @xmath8 .",
    "the functions @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the unit step function  @xcite , switch the coupling on and off . here",
    "@xmath11 is the time each carrier takes to cross the channel ; @xmath12 is the time interval that separates two consecutive qubits entering the channel . only when the @xmath13-th qubit is inside the channel the function @xmath14 .",
    "we assume @xmath4 is a stationary and gaussian stochastic process  @xcite with zero average value , characterized by its autocorrelation function @xmath15 .    to deal with this problem",
    ", we first consider the time evolution of the system for a given realization @xmath4 of the stochastic process , and then we perform an average over all possible realizations",
    ". the @xmath1-qubit time evolution operator for a given realization is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the phase acquired by the @xmath13-th qubit coherences after the qubit crossed the channel : @xmath18 time evolution is conveniently described in the factorized basis @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are eigenvectors of @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the initial state of the @xmath1-qubit system ; the final state @xmath23 after all @xmath1 qubits crossed the channel is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 $ ] . by averaging over the stochastic process we finally obtain @xmath26 which is a quantum operation for the n - qubits system : @xmath27 .",
    "it is possible to show that the quantity @xmath28 is itself a gaussian variable and @xmath29 with arbitrary variances and some degree of correlation , the two variables @xmath30 are again gaussian , as one can find by deriving the @xmath31 mixed density function from the one of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "each phase @xmath17 is a time integral of a gaussian stochastic process , so it can be view as the limit of a sum of gaussian variables , so in its turn it is gaussian .",
    "] , therefore @xmath33 we call this quantity the @xmath34-coherence decay factor , since it is just the damping experienced by the @xmath34 system coherence : @xmath35 next , by using the stationarity of @xmath4 , we calculate @xmath36 since the autocorrelation function can be expressed in terms of the power spectral density @xmath37 of @xmath4 we obtain @xmath38 ,   \\label{phase - correlation-2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the final form of the coherences decay factor follows : @xmath39                    \\bigg )   \\label{dmn }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result is identical to the coherences decay due to a dephasing channel modelled by a set of quantum harmonic oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the expression can be put in a nice and useful form . to this end",
    "we define @xmath40 as the correlation coefficient  @xcite between the phases @xmath17 and @xmath41 : @xmath42 where we set @xmath43 ; in fact , thanks to stationarity of the process , the quantity @xmath44 does not depend on @xmath13 ( see equation ) .",
    "the coherence decay factor can be rewritten as @xmath45 now we observe that @xmath46 is just the damping experienced by single qubit coherences for one channel use ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we finally write @xmath48 where we have defined @xmath49 .",
    "in fact the stationarity of @xmath4 implies that @xmath40 depends only on @xmath50 .",
    "the quantity @xmath51 is a measure of the degree of the correlation between the channel uses @xmath13 and @xmath52 .",
    "as a measure of the quantum information transmission reliability we use the _ entanglement fidelity _  @xcite . to define this quantity we look at the system @xmath53 as a part of a larger quantum system @xmath54 , initially in a pure entangled state @xmath55",
    ". the initial density operator of the system @xmath56 is then obtained from that of @xmath57 by a partial trace over the reference system @xmath58 : @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "the system @xmath60 is sent through the channel , while @xmath61 remains ideally isolated from any environment , being @xmath62 the final state of @xmath63 after the transmission .",
    "entanglement fidelity is just the fidelity between the initial and the final state of @xmath63 : @xmath64 first we consider a single use of the channel described by hamiltonian  . we suppose to feed the channel with a quantum source  @xcite described by the density operator @xmath65 .",
    "the entanglement fidelity is  @xcite : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the identity operator and @xmath68 .",
    "this case is relevant in quantum information field as it takes place when two communication parties try to share a bell state : the party that initially possesses the pair sends one half of it through the quantum channel @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 is the fidelity between the actually shared pair and the original one ; it means that a bell measurement on @xmath62 able to distinguish the ideally shared state from the other states of the bell basis fails with _ error probability _ @xmath71 . from it",
    "follows that the error probability for a single channel use is @xmath72 ; in what follows we identify this quantity by @xmath73 .",
    "now we suppose to use the three - qubit code ( tqc )  @xcite to send @xmath74 .",
    "the system s state is encoded by using two ancillary systems @xmath75 and @xmath76 . the system and the ancillary qubits are encoded by means of a set of quantum operations that we resume as @xmath77 ( stages a , b , c in ) and then transmitted in @xmath78 uses of channel",
    ". then the receiver performs the decoding @xmath79 ( stages e , f , g , h in ) on the system @xmath80 . after tracing out @xmath81",
    ", he obtains the final , generally mixed state of system @xmath82 : @xmath83\\ ] ] where @xmath84 .",
    "entanglement fidelity @xmath85 just gives the probability that the code is successful .",
    "the merit of this code is that it drastically reduces - in absence of use correlations , i.e. for @xmath86 - the transmission error probability from @xmath73 to @xmath87 .",
    "now we investigate the effects of channel correlations on the performance of a tqc . after some involved calculations it comes out that @xmath88 .",
    "\\label{fe - tqc - m-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by observing that @xmath89 and @xmath90 we can rewrite equation as : @xmath91 .",
    "\\label{fe - tqc - m-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an interesting result can be obtained by considering the case of a small error probability @xmath92 . in this regime",
    "we can take the series expansion of near @xmath93 : @xmath94 this expression tells us that even though memory lowers the fidelity , this worsening is always slight and absolutely negligible when @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , it highlights that channel correlations - inside the hamiltonian model - permit the tqc to maintain its error probability @xmath96 of the order of @xmath97 .",
    "however , one has to take care that in the case perfect memory the code error triplicates from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "these results are very similar to the ones by clemens _",
    "et al . _",
    "however , we discuss time rather than space correlations and average with respect to stochastic processes .    rather than choosing a particular autocorrelation function @xmath15 for @xmath4 and then trying to carry out a specific relation between it and the tqc error probability , we make some general considerations about the impact of correlations on the code error probability . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath100 and @xmath101 having positive values ( we do not consider anti - correlation cases ) .",
    "while the range of @xmath100 is @xmath102 $ ] , we can argue that @xmath103 since one expects that the phase correlation does not increase when increasing the channel uses distance ; furthermore it can be proved that it must be @xmath104 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath105 is a real variable : it is a quadratic form in @xmath105 and by imposing that it must always be positive we obtain the desired condition on @xmath101  @xcite . ] .",
    "studying the first derivatives of @xmath106 as a function of @xmath100 and @xmath101 it turns out that @xmath106 is monotonical with respect to @xmath100 ( error grows with @xmath100 ) , but not with respect to @xmath101 .",
    "it indeed can displays a minimum at @xmath107 $ ] , but its presence is substantially irrelevant , and one can reasonably say that the code error probability is also increasing with respect to @xmath101 . thus to characterize the @xmath106 behaviour , we plot it as a function @xmath100 , using @xmath108 as parameter .",
    "as it is showed in , in which we set @xmath109 , the tqc error probability weakly depends on @xmath100 , and the @xmath101 allowable values affect very little it . in the same figure",
    "we also plot the error probability for a two - qubit code  @xcite encoding a qubit into the subspace spanned by @xmath110 : the performance of this last code is always worse than the tqc ones , unless in the case @xmath111 , for which the coding subspace becomes decoherence - free .    .",
    "the dotted and the dashed grey lines represent respectively the single channel use error probability ( @xmath109 ) and tqc error probability for the memoryless channel ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the error probabilities for the three qubit code in presence of correlations ( @xmath113 ) are represented by black curves : solid curve refers to @xmath114 and the dotted one to @xmath115 .",
    "there is also displayed ( solid gray curve ) the error probability for a simple two - qubit code encoding a qubit into the subspace spanned by @xmath110.,width=283,height=219 ]    the tqc exhibits the same kind of behaviour showed in as @xmath73 changes . in we plot",
    "@xmath116 as a function of @xmath73 for @xmath117 , the case in which the code shows the worst performance ; we do not plot the cases of low correlations @xmath118 since the correspondent curves are practically indistinguishable from the memoryless ones .",
    "we also compare @xmath116 with the error probability of the two - qubit code  @xcite : to produce good results this last one requires very high degrees of correlation between successive channel uses .",
    "in conclusion we find that a hamiltonian formulation of a memory dephasing channel shows that the three qubit code is robust against channel correlations .",
    "significantly different results emerge if we describe channel correlations inside a markovian model  @xcite : in this latter case memory restores the @xmath119dependence in the code error probability , thus drastically reducing the code performance .    .",
    "the dashed grey line represents the tqc error probability in the memoryless case ( @xmath112 ) . for the error probabilities of the three qubit code in presence of correlations ( @xmath116 ) we plot the worst case @xmath120 by a dotted black curve .",
