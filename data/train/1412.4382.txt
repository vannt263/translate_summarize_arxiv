    "the doomsday paradox and the appeal to anthropic bounds to solve the cosmological constant problem are two examples of puzzles of probabilistic confirmation .",
    "these arguments both make ` cosmic ' predictions : the former gives us a probable end date for humanity , and the second a probable value of the vacuum energy density of the universe . they both seem to allow one to draw unwarranted conclusions from a _ lack of knowledge _ , and yet one way of formulating them makes them a straightforward application of bayesianism .",
    "they call for a framework of inductive logic that allows one to represent ignorance better than what can be achieved by orthodox bayesianism so as to block these conclusions .",
    "the doomsday argument is a family of arguments about humanity s likely survival .",
    "there are mainly two versions of the argument discussed in the literature , both of which appeal to a form of copernican principle ( or principle of typicality or mediocrity ) .",
    "a first version of the argument endorsed by , e.g. , john @xcite dictates a probability shift in favor of theories that predict earlier end dates for our species assuming that we are a typical  rather than atypical ",
    "member of that group .    the other main version of the argument , referred to as the ` delta-@xmath0 argument , ' was given by richard @xcite and has provoked both outrage and genuine scientific interest .",
    "it claims to allow one to make a prediction about the total duration of any process of indefinite duration based only on the assumption that the moment of observation is randomly selected . a variant of this argument , which gives equivalent predictions , reasons in terms of random `` sampling '' of one s rank in a sequential process @xcite .",
    "the argument goes as follows :    let @xmath1 be my birth rank ( i.e. , i am the @xmath2 human to be born ) , and @xmath3 the total number of humans that will ever be born .    1 .",
    "assume that there is nothing special about my rank @xmath1 .",
    "following the principle of indifference , for all @xmath1 , the probability of @xmath1 conditional on @xmath3 is @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   assume the following improper prior probability distribution , such that @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the probability for @xmath3 to be in any logarithmic interval is the same .",
    "this prior is called improper because it is not normalizable , and it is usually argued that it is justified when it yields a normalizable posterior.][gott_jeffreys ] for @xmath3 : @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is a normalizing constant , whose value does nt matter .",
    "this choice of distributions @xmath8 and @xmath9 gives us the prior distribution @xmath10 : @xmath11 4 .",
    "then , bayes s theorem gives us @xmath12 which favors small @xmath3 .",
    "to find an estimate with a confidence @xmath13 , we solve @xmath14 for @xmath15 , with @xmath16 . upon learning @xmath1 ,",
    "we are able to make a prediction about @xmath3 with a 95%-level confidence . here",
    ", we have @xmath17 .",
    "that is , we have @xmath18    according to that argument , we can make a prediction for @xmath3 based only on knowing our rank @xmath1 and on being indifferent about any value @xmath1 conditional on @xmath3 may take .",
    "this result should strike us as surprising : we should nt be able to learn something from nothing !",
    "if @xmath3 is unbounded , an appeal to our typical position should nt allow us to make any prediction at all , and yet it does .",
    "another probabilistic argument that claims to allow one to make a prediction from a lack of knowledge is commonly used in cosmology , in particular to solve the cosmological constant problem ( i.e. , explain the value of the vacuum energy density @xmath19 ) .",
    "this parameter presents physicists with two main problems :    1 .",
    "the time coincidence problem : we happen to live at the brief epoch  by cosmological standards  of the universe s history when it is possible to witness the transition from the domination of matter and radiation to vacuum energy ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "2 .   there is a large discrepancy  of 120 order of magnitudes  between the ( very small ) observed values of @xmath19 and the ( very large ) values suggested by particle - physics models .",
    "anthropic selection effects ( i.e. , our sampling bias as observers existing at a certain time and place and in a universe that must allow the existence of life ) have been used to explain both problems . in the absence of satisfying explanations , anthropic",
    "selection effects make the coincidence less unexpected , and account for the discrepancy between observations and possible expectations from available theoretical background .",
    "but there is no known reason why having @xmath20 should matter to the advent of life .",
    "steven weinberg and his collaborators @xcite , among others , proposed anthropic bounds on the possible values of @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , they argued that anthropic considerations may have a stronger , predictive role .",
    "the idea is that we should conditionalize the probability of different values of @xmath19 on the number of observers they allow : the most likely value of @xmath19 is the one that allows for the largest number of galaxies ( taken as a proxy for the number of observers ) .",
    "the probability measure for @xmath19 is then as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the prior probability distribution , and @xmath23 the average number of galaxies which form for @xmath19 .    by assuming that there is no known reason why the likelihood of @xmath19 should be special at the observed value , and because the allowed range of @xmath19 is very far from what we would expect from available theories",
    ", weinberg and his collaborators argued that it is reasonable to assume that the prior probability distribution is constant within the anthropically allowed range , so that @xmath24 can be calculated as proportional to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "weinberg then predicted that the value of @xmath19 would be close to the mean value in that range ( assumed to yield the largest number of observers ) .",
    "this `` principle of mediocrity , '' as alexander @xcite called it , assumes that we are typical observers .",
    "thus , anthropic considerations not only help establish the prior probability distribution for @xmath19 by providing bounds , but they also allow one to make a prediction regarding its observed value .",
    "this method has yielded predictions for @xmath19 only a few orders of magnitudes apart from the observed value .",
    "] this improvement  from 120 orders of magnitude to only a few  has been seen by their proponents as vindicating anthropically - based approaches .      the doomsday argument and anthropic reasoning share a similar structure : 1 ) a uniform prior probability distribution reflects an initial state of ignorance or indifference , and 2 ) an appeal to typicality or mediocrity",
    "is used to make a prediction .",
    "this is puzzling : these two assumptions of indifference and typicality are meant to express neutrality , and yet from them alone we seem to be getting a lot of information . but assuming neutrality _",
    "alone _ should not allow us to learn anything !",
    "if anthropic considerations were only able to provide us with one bound ( either lower or upper bound ) , then the argument used to make a prediction about the vacuum energy density @xmath19 would be analogous to gott s 1993 ` delta-@xmath0 argument ' : without knowing anything about , say , a parameter s upper bound , a uniform prior probability distribution over all possible ranges and the appeal to typicality of the observed value favors lower values for that parameter .",
    "i will briefly review several approaches taken to dispute the validity of the results obtained from these arguments .",
    "we will see that dropping the assumption of typicality is nt enough to avoid these paradoxical conclusions .",
    "i will show that , when dealing with events we are completely ignorant or indifferent about , one can use an imprecise , bayesian - friendly framework that better handles ignorance or indifference .",
    "the appeal to typicality is central to gott s `",
    "delta-@xmath0 argument , ' leslie s version of the doomsday argument , and weinberg s prediction .",
    "this assumption has generated much of the philosophical discussion about the doomsday argument in particular .",
    "nick @xcite offered a challenge to what he calls the self - sampling assumption ( ssa ) , according to which `` one should reason as if one were a random sample from the set of all observers in one s reference class . '' in order to avoid the consequence of the doomsday argument , bostrom suggested to adopt what he calls the self - indicating assumption ( sia ) : `` given the fact that you exist , you should ( other things equal ) favor hypotheses according to which many observers exist over hypotheses on which few observers exist . ''",
    "@xcite but as he noted himself @xcite , this sia is not acceptable as a general principle . indeed , as dennis @xcite summarized :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ such a principle would entail , e.g. , the unpalatable conclusion that armchair philosophizing would suffice for deciding between cosmological models that predict vastly different chances for the development of human civilization.the infinity of the universe would become certain a priori . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the biggest problem with doomsday - type arguments resting on the ssa is that their conclusion depends on the choice of reference class .",
    "what constitutes `` one s reference class '' seems entirely arbitrary or ill - defined : is my reference class that of all humans , mammals , philosophers , etc . ?",
    "anthropic predictions can be the object of a similar criticism : the value of the cosmological constant most favorable to the advent of life ( as we know it ) may not be the same as that most favorable to the existence of intelligent observers , which might be definable indifferent ways .",
    "relatedly , radford @xcite argued that conditionalizing on non - indexical information ( i.e. , all the information at the disposal of the agent formulating the doomsday argument , including all their memories ) reproduces the effects of assuming both ssa and sia .",
    "conditionalizing on the probability that an observer with all their non - indexical information exists ( which is higher for a later doomsday , and highest if there is no doomsday at all ) blocks the consequence of the doomsday argument , without invoking such ad hoc principles , and avoids the reference - class problem ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "although full non - indexical conditioning cancels out the effects of leslie s doomsday argument ( and , similarly , anthropic predictions ) , it is not clear that it also allows one to avoid the conclusion of gott s version of the doomsday argument .",
    "@xcite dismisses gott s argument because it rests _ only _ on an `` unsupported '' assumption of typicality .",
    "there are indeed no good reasons to endorse typicality a priori ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one might then hope that not assuming typicality would suffice to dissolve these cosmic puzzles .",
    "irit @xcite showed for instance that without it , anthropic considerations do nt allow one to really make predictions about the cosmological constant , beyond just providing unsurprising boundaries , namely , that the value of the cosmological constant must be such that life is possible .",
    "my approach in this paper , however , will not be to question the assumption of typicality .",
    "indeed , in gott s version of the doomsday argument given in ",
    "[ doomsday ] , we would obtain a prediction _ even if we did nt assume typicality_. instead of assuming a flat probability distribution for our rank @xmath1 conditional on the total number of humans @xmath3 , @xmath4 , let s assume a non - uniform distribution .",
    "for instance , let s assume a distribution that favors our being born in humanity s timeline s first decile ( i.e. , one that peaks around @xmath26 ) .",
    "we would then obtain a different prediction for @xmath3 than if we had assumed one that peaks around @xmath27 .",
    "this reasoning , however , yields an unsatisfying result if taken to the limit : if we assume a likelihood probability distribution for @xmath1 conditional on @xmath3 sharply peaked at @xmath28 , we would _ still _ obtain a prediction for @xmath3 upon learning @xmath1 ( see figure  [ atypical ] ) .",
    "conditional on @xmath1 , obtained for @xmath29 and assuming different likelihood distributions for @xmath1 conditional on @xmath3 ( i.e. , with different assumptions as to our relative place in humanity s timeline ) , which each peaks at different values @xmath30 .",
    "the lowermost curve corresponds to a likelihood distribution that peaks at @xmath31 , i.e. , if we assume @xmath32 . ]    therefore , in gott s doomsday argument , we would obtain a prediction at any confidence - level , whatever assumption we make as to our typicality or atypicality , and we would even obtain one if we assume @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , it is toward the question of a probabilistic representation of ignorance or indifference that i will now turn my attention .",
    "one could hope that a more adequate prior probability distribution ",
    "one that better reflects our ignorance and is normalizable  may prevent the conclusion of these cosmic puzzles ( especially gott s doomsday argument ) .",
    "the idea that a uniform probability distribution is not a satisfying representation of ignorance is nothing new ; this discussion is as old as the principle of indifference itself . as argued by john",
    "@xcite , a uniform probability distribution is unable to fulfill invariance requirements that one should expect of a representation of ignorance or indifference :    -    non - additivity ,    invariance under redescription ,    invariance under negation : if we are ignorant or indifferent as to whether or not @xmath13 , we must be equally ignorant as to whether or not @xmath33 .    for instance ,",
    "in the case of the cosmological constant problem , if we adopt a uniform probability distribution for the value of the vacuum energy density @xmath19 over an anthropically allowed range of length @xmath34 , then we are committed to assert , e.g. , that @xmath19 is 3 times more likely to be found in a any range of length @xmath35 than in any other range of length @xmath36 .",
    "this is very different from indifference or ignorance , hence the requirement of non - additivity for a representation of ignorance .    these criteria for a representation of ignorance or indifference cast doubt on the possibility for a probabilistic logic of induction to overcome these limitations .",
    "i will argue that an imprecise model of bayesianism , in which our credences can be fuzzy , will be able to explain away these problems without abandoning bayesianism altogether .",
    "it has been argued ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that bayesian credences need not have sharp values , and that there can be imprecise credences ( or ` imprecise probabilities ' by misuse of language ) .",
