    "mathematical principles play significant roles in understanding quantum physics .",
    "the concept `` exact integrability '' originally came from the early study of the classical dynamical systems which were described by some differential equations .",
    "usually , the solutions of those differential equations are tantamount to the determination of enough integration constants , i.e. , the integrals of motions . in this sense ,",
    "classical integrability is synonymous with exact solution .",
    "however , conceptual understanding of quantum integrability should trace back to hans bethe s seminal work to obtain the energy eigenstates of the one - dimensional heisenberg spin chain with the nearest interaction in 1931.@xcite he proposed a special form of the wavefunction  superposition of all possible permutations of plane waves in a ring of size @xmath0 , namely , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of down spins and @xmath3 stand for a permutation @xmath4 of @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 plane waves are @xmath2-fold products of individual exponential phase factors @xmath7 . here",
    "the @xmath2 distinct wave numbers @xmath8 are permuted among the @xmath2 distinct coordinates @xmath9 .",
    "each of the @xmath6 plane waves has an amplitude coefficient which can be in turn determined by solving the eigenvalue problem of the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "the bethe s ansatz appeared to be escaped from physicists attention that time .",
    "it was only 30 years later that in 1963 lieb and liniger@xcite first solved the one - dimensional ( 1d ) many - body problem of delta - function interacting bosons by bethe s hypothesis .",
    "the exact solution for the delta - function interacting bose gas was given in terms of the wave numbers @xmath8 ( @xmath10 ) satisfying a set of bethe ansatz equations , called the lieb ",
    "liniger equations .",
    "the spectrum was given by summing up all @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , the bethe ansatz equations describe the roles of individual particles in many - body corrections .",
    "the significance of quantum integrability is such that the roles of individual particles enable one to precisely access full aspects of many - body physics for a particular university class of many - body systems , for example , spin chains , interacting quantum gases , strongly correlated electronic systems , kondo impurity problems , gaudin magnets , etc .",
    "once concerning ensemble statistics , we have to properly distinguish physical origin of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles . at room temperature ,",
    "the molecules in the air can be treated as billard balls that occasionally collide with each other .",
    "the size of those molecules is much smaller than the mean distance between them .",
    "the particles are distinguishable .",
    "however , according to de broglie matter wave theory , the thermal wavelength of a moving particle is given by a simple formula : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the mass of the particle , @xmath14 is the plank constant , @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath16 is the temperature .",
    "the temperature becomes very low , the thermal wave length increases , and the wave packets start to overlap .",
    "thus , the particles are indistinguishable below the degenerate temperature .",
    "the quantum statistics play an essential role under such a degenerate temperature . below the degenerate temperature , there are thus fundamental differences between the properties of fermions ( with spins of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and bosons ( with spins of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "all fermions must obey the pauli exclusion principle , which means that they can not occupy the same quantum state .",
    "however , as bosons are not subject to the same restrictions , they can collapse under suitable conditions into the same quantum ground state , known as a bose ",
    "einstein condensate .",

    "the minimization of gibbs free energy gives rise to the so - called yang ",

    ", the total number of particles can be associated with chemical potential @xmath23 .",
    "the temperature is associated with the entropy @xmath24 , counting thermal disorder .",
    "this canonical yang",
    " yang approach marks a significant step to the exact solutions of finite temperature many - body physics .",
    "it shows the subtlety of vacuum fluctuation , interaction effect , excitation modes , criticality , quantum statistics , thermalization , dynamics , correlations , and luttinger liquid .",
    "the name bethe s hypothesis was coined by yang c n and yang c p in the study of the heisenberg spin chain .",
    "the bethe ansatz is now well accepted as a synonym of quantum integrability . > from solving eigenvalue problem of spin-1/2 delta - function interacting fermi gas , yang@xcite found that the many - body scattering matrix can be reduced to a product of many two - body scattering matrices , i.e. , a necessary condition for solvability of the 1d many - body systems .",
    "the two - body scattering matrix satisfies a certain intertwined relation , called yang  baxter equation .",
    "this seminal work has inspired a great deal of developments in physics and mathematics .",
    "baxter relation was independently shown by baxter as the conditions for commuting transfer matrices in two - dimensional statistical mechanics.@xcite for such exactly solved models , the energy eigen - spectrum of the model hamiltonian can be obtained exactly in terms of the bethe ansatz equations , from which physical properties can be derived via mathematical analysis . the lieb  liniger bose gas@xcite and yang ",

    "baxter solvable models have flourished into majority in physics since last 70 s .",

    "baxter integrability plays an important role in physical and mathematical studies.@xcite the bethe ansatz approach has also found success in the realm of condensed matter physics , such as kondo impurity problems , bcs pairing models , strongly correlated electron systems and spin ladders , cold atoms , quantum optics , quantum statistical mechanics , etc .",
    "baxter equation has led to significant developments in mathematics , such as 2d conformal field theory , quantum croups , knot theory , 2d statistical problems , lattice loop models , random walks , etc .",
    "recent research showed that there exists a remarkable connection between conformal field theory and yang ",
    "baxter integrability of 2d lattice models .",
    "remarkably , conformal field theory has led to the theory of vertex operator algebras , modular tensor categories , and algebraic topology in connection to new states of matter with topological order , such as fractional quantum hall effect , topological insulators , etc . in this elementary introduction to the exactly solvable lieb  liniger model , we will discuss the rigorousness of mathematical integrability and the novelty of quantum many - body effects that comprise the beautiful cold world of many - body systems in the lab .",

    "<S> lieb and liniger first solved this quantum field theory many - body problem using the bethe s hypothesis , i.e. a particular form of wave function introduced by bethe in solving the one - dimensional heisenberg model in 1931 . despite the lieb - liniger model </S>",
    "<S> is arguably the simplest exactly solvable model , it exhibits rich quantum many - body physics in terms of the aspects of mathematical integrability and physical universality . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the yang - yang grand canonical ensemble description for the model provides us with a deep understanding of quantum statistics , thermodynamics and quantum critical phenomena at the many - body physics level . </S>",
    "<S> recently , such fundamental physics of this exactly solved model has been attracting growing interest in experiments . since 2004 </S>",
    "<S> , there have been more than 20 experimental papers that report novel observations of different physical aspects of the lieb - liniger model in the lab . </S>",
    "<S> so far the observed results to date are seen to be in excellent agreement with results obtained using the analysis of this simplest exactly solved model . </S>",
    "<S> those experimental observations reveal the unique beauty of integrability . </S>"
