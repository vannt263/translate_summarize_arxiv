    "dynamical triangulation is a discrete approach to the path integral for euclidean quantum gravity in which the euclidean spacetimes are constructed by ` glueing ' together geometric objects such as equilateral hypercubes or simplices .",
    "hypercubes were used at first @xcite whereas the modern formulation which developed independently out 2d gravity uses simplices .",
    "results of numerical simulations of the commonly used 4d model were first presented in @xcite . as a model of gravity",
    "dynamical triangulation ought to have a scaling regime where it corresponds to semiclassical einstein gravity .",
    "one wishes to recover classical euclidean spacetimes , newton s potential and the formation of gravitationally bound states .",
    "it is not clear that a purely euclidean formulation should be able to contain semiclassical gravity , because of the well known divergence related to the unboundedness of the euclidean version of the einstein - hilbert action . in a semiclassical evaluation of the euclidean path integral",
    "this can be dealt with by deforming the integration over the conformal mode into the imaginary direction of the complex plane @xcite .",
    "the dynamical triangulation formulation is completely regular from the start .",
    "the model has a phase transition as a function of a parameter which is proportional to the inverse bare newton constant : @xmath0 .",
    "the transition separates a phase with crumpled spacetimes and very high effective dimensionalities , from an ` elongated ' phase with effectively two - dimensional spacetimes with characteristics of a branched polymer @xcite . near the transition the model appears to produce classical @xmath1-like spacetimes , in an intermediate distance regime , and there is evidence for scaling , suggesting continuum behaviour theory).]@xcite . in the elongated phase the scaling degenerates into a branched polymer version @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest to find out if this scaling region can be described by an effective action of the type @xmath2 the branched polymer phase is presumably an expression of the conformal mode instability of the @xmath3-part in this effective action at scales of order @xmath4 , while the crumpled phase may correspond to negative @xmath5 .",
    "recent evidence suggests that the transition is of first order @xcite , instead of second order as thought previously .",
    "the first order nature of the transition need not stand in the way of continuum behaviour as the examples of gauge - higgs models show .",
    "these models have a first order phase transition also in the continuum treatment . for dynamical triangulation",
    "we suggested previously @xcite that continuum behavior may be automatic , as in two dimensions gauge theories , which have a coulomb phase for @xmath6 , with massless photons in a region of parameter space , without the need for tuning to a critical point .",
    "gauge - higgs models of this type can have furthermore a first order coulomb - higgs transition @xcite .",
    "the models approach the u(1)-higgs model as @xmath7 . because of triviality a continuum _ limit _ will be noninteracting , but the models may still be regarded ( for finite sufficiently large @xmath8 ) as a nonperturbative formulation of the abelian higgs model in the continuum . ] .",
    "it is a priori possible that continuum analysis of the effective theory ( [ seff ] ) also leads to a first order transition between phases with positive , since the spacetimes found in its neighbourhood are @xmath1-like , cf .",

    "the above interpretations are very speculative and more analytical as well as numerical work has to be done to establish or reject it .",
    "it would be very interesting if we could measure the attraction of two sources at a fixed distance .",
    "this has been pursued in the regge calculus formulation of simplicial quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "such measurements could then be compared with the simple newtonian law or with quantum corrections to this law , which have for instance been calculated in @xcite and @xcite . in dynamical triangulation",
    "a computation of the gravitational potential appears nontrivial , because it is difficult in a fluctuating spacetime to keep two heavy test masses at a fixed distance .",
    "however , the formation of bound states out of two test particles can be computed in a way that is customary in lattice field theory and we shall report on such computations in this paper .",

    "we take @xmath10 as a test particle here , i.e.  the back reaction of the field @xmath10 on the metric is not taken into account . in lattice",
    "qcd this approximation is often called the quenched approximation , or valence quark approximation , because it neglects diagrams with internal quark ( in our case @xmath10 ) loops . for not too light quark masses",

    "alternatively we can integrate @xmath20 over the volume at distance @xmath25 , average over metrics , and then divide by the same with @xmath30 , @xmath31 a similar ambiguity arises with purely geometric correlators @xcite .",
    "our physical intuition tends to favour the form ( [ scalprop ] ) , and we shall later use its analogue in dynamical triangulation . however , if there is no pair @xmath32 with @xmath33 for a given metric @xmath34 the expression becomes mathematically ill defined , whereas ( [ scalprop2 ] ) has no such problem . for",

    "this expression neglects finite size effects and should be modified when looking at distances comparable to a typical length scale in the system .",

    "if this energy turns out to be less than two times the mass of a single particle , the difference can be interpreted as a binding energy between the particles .",
    "this would show gravitational attraction between them .",
    "since the spacetimes to be used in the binding energy computations have topology @xmath1 and the average spacetime is expected to be homogeneous , it will be useful to know the properties of scalar field propagators on spaces of constant curvature . to calculate such propagators we have to solve the equation @xmath40 with the boundary condition @xmath41 as the geodesic distance @xmath42 .",

    "we can then calculate @xmath28 and @xmath113 by averaging @xmath114 respectively its square over all points @xmath24 at distance @xmath25 from the origin @xmath23 , and then over origins and configurations , @xmath115 ( we have not indicated the average over origins @xmath23 ) .",
    "notice that ( [ simpleg ] ) corresponds to ( [ scalprop ] ) in the continuum .",
    "to improve the calculation of the binding energy , we can try to use what are called `` smeared sources '' .",
    "the use of these smeared sources can improve the data by increasing the contribution of the ground state and decreasing the contribution of the excited states . instead of using ( [ simpleg2 ] )",
    ", we can calculate @xmath28 by averaging @xmath114 over all points at distance @xmath25 from the origin @xmath23 , and only after taking this average , square it for the calculation of @xmath113 : @xmath116 this corresponds to taking the propagator from a source that is not a single point , but a complete shell around the origin .",
    "such a source may have a bigger overlap with the ground state wave function and a smaller one with the excited wave functions .",
    "for a discussion of the use of these smeared sources in qcd , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "because the average of the square of a fluctuating quantity is always greater than the square of its average , it is obvious that @xmath117 .",
    "this does not yet imply anything about the way they fall off .",
    "in particular it is not guaranteed that the energy of the two - particle state is less than twice the energy of the one particle states .    in figure [ 4dprop ]",
    "we see the results for four different bare masses .",
    "each pair of lines corresponds to one bare mass . in each pair",
    "the upper line is @xmath113 ( using ( [ simpleg2 ] ) ) and the lower line is @xmath118 of eq .",
    "( [ simpleg ] ) .",
    "we used @xmath119 configurations recorded every @xmath120 sweeps ( 1 sweep = @xmath74 accepted moves ) . for each of the masses we used @xmath121 origins per configuration",
    "the coupling constant @xmath89 , which is the lower of the two @xmath75 values used in the @xmath80 figure  [ s4fig ] .    there is clearly a difference in slope between the lines in each pair .",
    "this shows that the energy of the two particle state is less than two times the mass of a single particle and consequently that there is a positive binding energy between the particles .    using this data we can measure the renormalised mass @xmath37 , by assuming a long distance behaviour of @xmath122 .",
    "the results are ( in parenthesis is the value of @xmath75 ) @xmath123 it was argued in @xcite that the physical mass should vanish at zero bare mass and that therefore the renormalisation would be only multiplicative .",
    "our data seem to show that the relation is more complicated .",
    "increasing @xmath11 by a factor of @xmath124 increases @xmath37 by a factor of about @xmath125 .    comparing figure  [ curvature ] with figure  [ 4dprop ] , we see that the long distance behaviour is indeed similar , being an exponential .",
    "the finite size effect of the @xmath1-like curvature is apparently negligible , except perhaps for the smallest mass .",
    "the short distance behaviour is quite different .",
    "the propagators in figure  [ 4dprop ] curve downward towards the origin , while the free propagators shown in figure  [ 4dprop ] curve upwards due to the @xmath126 behaviour .",
    "the curving downward is unusual , because a propagator is interpreted as a sum of decaying exponentials corresponding to the ground state and various excited states .",
    "a closer look shows that the downward curvature occurs for distances smaller than about @xmath127 , which is roughly the end of the ` planckian regime ' mentioned in the previous section .",
    "as we have seen in figure  [ curvature ] , larger positive curvature means that the propagator decreases more slowly .",
    "therefore , such a planckian regime may cause the propagator to decrease less at smaller distances where the effective curvature is large than at the longer distances where the effective curvature is small .    using these data",
    ", we can now estimate the binding energy of the particles . from ( [ gofd ] ) and ( [ g2ofd ] ) we have",
    "@xmath128 as we can not use infinite distances , we will consider the effective binding energy @xmath129 for finite @xmath25 and look whether this expression becomes constant .    figure  [ be255 ] shows this quantity as a function of the geodesic distance , using the smeared estimator ( [ improg2 ] ) for @xmath113 .",
    "the four curves again correspond to the four different bare masses in figure  [ 4dprop ] .",
    "to avoid the correlations between origins on the same configuration and between points at the same distance of such an origin influencing the error bars , we first averaged all the measurements of each configuration and used a jackknife method on these averages to calculate the error bars .",
    "it is clear that the binding energy goes to a non - zero value , with the exception of the lowest mass , where the effective binding energy does not seem to converge within the limited distance range .",
    "we chose not to display distances larger than the position of the maximum of @xmath80 in figure  [ s4fig ] .",
    "unfortunately , the correlation between the mass and the binding energy does not appear to be strictly positive .",
    "the lowest binding energy belongs to the highest mass .",
    "we defer a more elaborate discussion to the next section .",
    "figure  [ be259 ] shows the corresponding data for @xmath130 which is the higher of the two @xmath75 values used in figure  [ s4fig ] for @xmath80 . in this case",
    "we used @xmath131 configurations , again with @xmath121 origins per configuration .",
    "the data look very similar . here",
    "the ordering of binding energies follows more clearly that of the constituent masses , except for the largest mass @xmath132 .    to see the effect of using smeared sources we show in figure  [ be259unsm ] the effective binding energy using the unsmeared estimator ( [ simpleg2 ] ) for @xmath133 , the analogue of figure  [ be259 ] .",
    "the use of smeared sources ( figure  [ be259 ] compared to figure  [ be259unsm ] ) does indeed improve the convergence to a definite value and the effective binding energies are generally smaller .",
    "in particular the curve for a bare mass of @xmath134 , which keeps going down in figure  [ be255 ] becomes more horizontal .",
    "only the smallest mass is an exception , where neither case has converged yet in the distance range shown .    to determine the binding energies",

    "one would expect @xmath138 to be positive since @xmath139 will be relatively less effective in creating the two - particle bound state than @xmath10 the single particle state . if the single and two - particle propagators behave sufficiently like a scalar propagator in flat space we would have @xmath140 , hence also @xmath141 .",
    "the results fo the fits in the region @xmath142 ( recall @xmath143 ) are shown in the following table .",
    "@xmath144 the signs of @xmath138 and @xmath145 appear to follow the above expectations , except for @xmath145 for the smallest bare mass .",
    "the corresponding effective binding energy is still falling for the distances shown and has to be viewed with caution . we can not improve on this because we do not trust distances much beyond the maximum of @xmath80 since these run into its asymmetric tail .",
    "the spacetimes produced by the dynamical triangulation model have semiclassical features near the phase transition . for the binding energy computations we have chosen two values of @xmath75 such that the volume at distance @xmath25 , @xmath80 , behaves like that of a four - sphere , for not too large distances @xmath25 outside a ` planckian regime ' .",
    "let us briefly recall here our scenario for reducing the lattice distance @xcite : increasing @xmath74 we have to tune @xmath75 such that we stay on the same scaling function @xmath146 .",
    "this can be tried for different starting points @xmath147 , corresponding to different shapes of @xmath148 as a function of @xmath149 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath148 has to be carefully re - examined , especially now the phase transition appears to be first order .",
    "the data for a nonzero binding energy are quite convincing and encouraging . for given bare mass @xmath11 ,",
    "the resulting renormalized masses @xmath37 are closer to @xmath11 and the binding energies turn out to be smaller for the larger @xmath75 value ( 1.259 ) , than for the smaller value ( 1.255 ) .",
    "this suggests that the renormalized newton constant @xmath5 is smaller for the larger @xmath75 value , assuming of course @xmath5 exists and is positive for these @xmath75 values . since @xmath150 and one would indeed expect @xmath5 to decrease when @xmath75 increases .",
    "we would like to be able to extract @xmath5 from the data , for example according to the nonrelativistic formula @xmath151 this formula is just the familiar energy @xmath152 of the hydrogen atom in the ground state , but with the gravitational parameters substituted as @xmath153 and the reduced mass @xmath154 .",
    "because the formula ( [ hydrogenlike ] ) is nonrelativistic it may not suffice to fit the data . to get a rudimentary feeling for corrections to ( [ hydrogenlike ] ) we consider the hamiltonian @xmath155 replacing @xmath156 and minimising the energy leads to @xmath157 which suggests that @xmath158 has to be considered ` large ' .",
    "unfortunately , the data in figure [ be255 ] or [ be259 ] show no sign of the @xmath159 behaviour of ( [ hydrogenlike ] ) , and neither is ( [ berel ] ) of any help .",
    "even the largest constituent mass @xmath160 , which is evidently so large in lattice units that only qualitative conclusions may be drawn from it , leads to a small binding energy . for the lighter constituent masses",
    "the binding energy is only modestly dependent on @xmath37 .",
    "perhaps the behaviour for the lightest constituent mass hints at a possible interpretation .",
    "if we make the bold assumption that the nonrelativistic formula ( [ hydrogenlike ] ) starts making sense for the lightest constituent masses , ( [ mm0],[eb ] ) lead to a renormalised planck length @xmath161 and 7.4 respectively for @xmath89 and 1.259 .",
    "this appears to contradict the suggestion above that @xmath5 is smaller for the larger @xmath75 value , but the uncertainties in @xmath37 are greatly magnified by taking its fifth power .",
    "the values for @xmath4 are reasonable and they are furthermore similar to the ( somewhat vague ) distance scale the planckian regime ends . on the other hand ,",
    "the size of a nonrelativistic bound state is of order of @xmath162 , so if indeed @xmath163 , we should perhaps not be surprised to find odd behaviour for bound state sizes of the order of the planck length , or constituent masses greater than the planck mass @xmath164 .",
    "clearly , we are having a problem of separating scales : we would like @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is a measure of the size of our @xmath1-`universe ' ( the distance where the volume @xmath80 is maximal ) .",
    "in our situation , at best , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the size of our universe is only three times the planck length .",
    "it is essential for a physical interpretation that as the lattices get bigger , the planckian regime and @xmath4 shrink in units of @xmath169 .",
    "we found some evidence for this in our scaling analysis @xcite where we ventured a scenario in which @xmath170 because of triviality .",
    "this approach to zero might then be only logarithmic , which would make the problem of scale separation severe from the computational point of view .",
