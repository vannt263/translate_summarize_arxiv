    "<S> * magnetite ( fe@xmath0o@xmath1 ) , an archetypal transition metal oxide , has been used for thousands of years , from lodestones in primitive compasses@xcite to a candidate material for magnetoelectronic devices.@xcite in 1939 verwey@xcite found that bulk magnetite undergoes a transition at @xmath2  k from a high temperature `` bad metal '' conducting phase to a low - temperature insulating phase . </S>",
    "<S> he suggested@xcite that high temperature conduction is via the fluctuating and correlated valences of the octahedral iron atoms , and that the transition is the onset of charge ordering upon cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the verwey transition mechanism and the question of charge ordering remain highly controversial.@xcite here we show that magnetite nanocrystals and single - crystal thin films exhibit an electrically driven phase transition below the verwey temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the signature of this transition is the onset of sharp conductance switching in high electric fields , hysteretic in voltage . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this transition is not due to local heating , but instead is due to the breakdown of the correlated insulating state when driven out of equilibrium by electrical bias . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that further studies of this newly observed transition and its low - temperature conducting phase will shed light on how charge ordering and vibrational degrees of freedom determine the ground state of this important compound . </S>",
    "<S> *    strongly correlated electronic materials can exhibit dramatic electronic properties ( _ e.g. _ , high temperature superconductivity , metal - insulator transitions , and charge ordering ) not present in simple systems with weaker electron - electron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> such rich electronic phenomenology can result when electron - electron interactions , electron - phonon interactions , and electronic bandwidth are all of similar magnitude , as in magnetite.@xcite verwey@xcite found nearly seven decades ago that bulk magnetite , while moderately conductive at room temperature , undergoes a transition to a more insulating state below what is now called the verwey temperature , @xmath3  k. similar transitions are known in a number of materials.@xcite above @xmath4 , fe@xmath5o@xmath6 has an inverse - spinel structure of the form ab@xmath7o@xmath6 , with tetrahedrally coordinated a sites occupied by fe@xmath8 and octrahedrally coordinated b sites of mixed valence , equally occupied by irons with formal @xmath9 and @xmath10 charges . </S>",
    "<S> conduction at high temperatures has long been thought to be through fluctuating valences of the b sites , with the transition corresponding to some kind of b site charge ordering as @xmath11 decreases ; concurrent is a first - order structural phase transition to an orthorhombic unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> this explanation remains controversial,@xcite with experiments showing some charge disproportion or charge order ( co),@xcite and others implying that the structural degrees of freedom drive the change in conductivity.@xcite recent theoretical progress has been made in understanding the complex interplay of charge and structural degrees of freedom@xcite , including a complete picture of the transition mechanism @xcite with strongly correlated 3@xmath12 fe electrons acting to amplify electron - phonon couplings . </S>",
    "<S> testing these ideas experimentally is of much interest .    in this letter </S>",

    "<S> the data clearly show that the transition is not the result of local heating above @xmath4 , but instead is an electrically - driven breakdown of the insulating state . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible explanations for this switching in the context of the general verwey transition problem . </S>",
    "<S> while qualitatively similar resistive switching has been observed in other correlated oxide systems@xcite , the phenomenon in fe@xmath5o@xmath6 is a bulk effect with a mechanism distinct from these .    . </S>",

    "<S> analysis of @xmath29 at lower temperatures shows that @xmath27 increases significantly as @xmath11 is decreased , exceeding 80  k@xmath20 by 80  k. this complicates the analysis of the switching , since some of the total @xmath21 is dropped across @xmath27 rather than directly within the fe@xmath5o@xmath6 ; further , the contacts may not be ohmic near the switching threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we return to this issue later .    </S>",
    "<S> the transitions in all devices are extremely sharp , with widths less than 50  @xmath28v , though in repeated sweeps at a fixed temperature , there is sweep - to - sweep variability of a few mv in switching thresholds . using the substrate as a gate electrode , no discernable gate modulation was seen in nanocrystal devices for gate biases between -80  v and + 80  v ; this suggests that nanocrystal charging effects do not dominate . </S>",
    "<S> switching characteristics were independent of magnetic field perpendicular to the sample surface up to 9  t , showing no large coupling between magnetization and the transition .    </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath22 is relatively temperature independent . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath11 is decreased , a clear zero - bias suppression develops , deepening into a hard gap when @xmath30 . in the nanocrystal data there are indications ( in @xmath31 ) of gap formation even at 150  k. we note that @xmath4 in nanocrystals could be elevated , since nanocrystals have large surface - to - volume ratios and the transition temperature of the magnetite surface is known to be higher than in the bulk.@xcite    20  nm diameter nanocrystals . </S>",
    "<S> inset : hysteresis loop in the conduction of the same device at 80  k , showing essentially no change in switching characteristics as the voltage sweep rate is varied over two orders of magnitude . , width=302 ]    several lines of evidence indicate that these sharp conductance transitions are _ not _ the result of local joule heating ( as in macroscopic samples of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and in the mott insulator vo@xmath7 @xcite ) , but rather are electrically driven . in the worst - case scenario , </S>",
    "<S> all of the @xmath32 joule heating power is dissipated within the magnetite , and inhomogeneous dissipation ( _ e.g. _ , filamentary conduction through a locally heated path ) can complicate the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the local steady - state temperature is determined by the power dissipated and the thermal path . thermally driven switching would then correspond to raising the _ local _ temperature above @xmath33 . at a fixed cryostat temperature an improved thermal path would imply that more power dissipation would be required for a given local temperature rise . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for a fixed thermal path , the necessary dissipated power for thermal switching would approach zero as @xmath34 . furthermore , at a given cryostat temperature thermally - driven switching would imply that the power dissipated at the low - to - high conductance transition ( needed to raise the local temperature to @xmath4 ) should be close to that at the high - to - low conductance transition .    </S>",
    "<S> the thermal conductivity , @xmath35 , of magnetite is dominated by phonons in this temperature range , and limited by phonon - electron scattering,@xcite even when @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> as a result , @xmath35 increases as @xmath11 is _ decreased _ through and below @xmath4 , and the material s thermal coupling to the cryostat _ improves _ as @xmath11 is reduced . in _ </S>",

    "<S> this is precisely the opposite of what one would expect from thermally - driven switching . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in all devices the power dissipated at switching does _ not _ approach zero as @xmath34 , again inconsistent with thermally - driven switching . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at a given @xmath11 the power dissipated just before @xmath21 is swept back down through the high - to - low conductance threshold significantly exceeds that dissipated at the low - to - high point in many devices , including those in fig .  1 , inconsistent with thermal switching expectations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , nanocrystal and thin film devices show quantitatively similar switching properties and trends with temperature , despite what would be expected to be very different thermal paths . </S>",
    "<S> these switching characteristics are also qualitatively very different from those in known inhomogeneous joule heating.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these facts rule out local heating through the verwey transition as the cause of the conductance switching .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 ( inset ) shows details of hysteresis loops on a nanocrystal device comparing different voltage sweep rates . </S>",
    "<S> the loop shape and switching voltages are unchanged to within the precision of the data collection as voltage sweep rates are varied from around 0.7  v / s up to 70  v / s . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the switching process is relatively rapid . </S>",
    "<S> further studies will examine the intrinsic switching speed .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed conductance transition appears to be driven _ </S>",
    "<S> electrically_. figure 4 is a plot of the low - to - high conductance switching voltage as a function of @xmath25 in a series of film devices for several temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the linear dependence implies that the transition is driven by electric field itself , rather than by the absolute magnitude of the voltage or the current density . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the voltage extrapolates to a nonzero value at @xmath37 is likely a contact resistance effect . </S>",
    "<S> minimizing and better understanding the contact resistance will allow the determination of the electric field distribution within the channel .    </S>",
    "<S> the length scaling of the transition voltage also demonstrates that this is a _ bulk _ </S>",
    "<S> effect . </S>",
    "<S> the contacts in all of these devices are identical , so any change in switching properties must result from the magnetite channel . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the resistive switching in pr@xmath38ca@xmath39mno@xmath5 ( pcmo ) that is ascribed to a change in contact resistance due to occupation of interfacial states@xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> strongly implies that for each temperature there is a characteristic electric field required for switching . </S>",
    "<S> the non - zero intercepts of the trend lines indicate that some device - dependent threshold voltage must be exceeded for switching even when @xmath37 , suggestive of contact effects.,width=302 ]    the field - driven conductance transition may give insights into the equilibrium verwey transition </S>",
    "<S> . this switching may be useful in testing recent calculations@xcite about the role of strongly correlated b - site fe 3@xmath12 electrons and their coupling to phonons in the verwey transition mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to ask , to what degree is the field - driven electronic transition coupled to the local structure ? </S>",
    "<S> it is greatly desirable to perform local probes of the magnetite structure ( via x - ray or electron - diffraction techniques or scanned probe microscopy ) _ in situ _ in the channel of biased devices , to see if the coherence between structural symmetry changes and the formation of a gap in the electronic spectrum is broken under these noequilibrium conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this is a significant experimental challenge . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , local raman spectroscopy of devices under bias could reveal field - induced changes in phonon modes and electron - phonon couplings , and single - crystal thin films permit the application of bias along well - defined crystallographic directions relevant to structural symmetry changes at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we do note that qualitatively identical switching occurs in nanocrystal devices as in strained thin films strongly coupled to rigid mgo substrates . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that elastic constraints on scales much larger than the unit cell have relatively little influence on the observed switching .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible that the nonequilibrium carrier distribution contributes to destabilizing the insulating state . in the presence of a strong electric field </S>",
    "<S> a carrier can gain significant energy even in a _ </S>",
    "<S> single _ hopping step , even though carrier relaxation times are very short . a rough estimate of the average critical @xmath40-field for switching at 80  k is @xmath41  v / m , from the slope of the line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . the high temperature cubic unit cell is 0.84  nm on a side , meaning that a carrier traversing one cell would gain approximately 8.4  mev , comparable to @xmath42  10.3  mev . </S>",
    "<S> conductance switching at such high fields may require consideration of such nonequilibrium carrier dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of multiple switching transitions in individual nanocrystal and film devices also bears further study . </S>",
    "<S> the suggested charge order may melt inhomogeneously , with portions of the channel having different switching thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> there could also be charge - ordered intermediate states between the insulating regime and the most conducting regime.@xcite again , optical measurements@xcite with sufficient spatial resolution could address these possibilities . through improved metal / magnetite contacts and further study , it should be possible to unravel the precise nature of this nonequilibrium transition , and its relationship to the equilibrium , bulk verwey transition . </S>"
