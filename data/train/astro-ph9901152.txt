    "at large temperatures or large densities hadronic matter is expected to undergo two phase transitions : one which deconfines quarks ( and gluons ) and one which restores chiral symmetry . up to",
    "now it is an unsettled issue whether these two phase transitions are distinct or coincide .",
    "the more , it is even unclear whether there are real phase transitions or only rapid crossover transitions .",
    "such transitions have received much attention in heavy ion physics as well as in the context of neutron stars which provide a unique environment to study cold matter at supernuclear densities @xcite . even though a deconfinement phase transition seems intuitively evident at large enough densities , from a theoretical point of view a confirmation of the existence of a deconfined quark phase in neutron stars",
    "is so far limited by the uncertainties in modeling qcd at large densities . all the more it is important to study and compare different available models to shed some light on similarities and differences with respect to the behavior of matter at large densities as well as on the corresponding predictions of neutron star properties like e.g.  its mass and radius . in the future such experience may prove to be useful if either an improved understanding of matter under extreme conditions provides a more exclusive selection between the various models or new experimental results on neutron star properties are available to set more stringent constraints .    usually the quark matter phase is modeled in the context of the mit bag model @xcite as a fermi gas of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 quarks . in this model the phenomenological bag constant @xmath3 is introduced to mimic qcd interactions to a certain degree .",
    "the investigation of such a phase was furthermore stimulated by the idea that a quark matter phase composed of almost an equal amount of the three lightest quark flavors could be the ground state of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "indeed , for a wide range of model parameters such as the bag constant , bag models predict that the quark matter phase is absolutely stable i.e.  its energy per baryon at zero pressure is lower than the one of @xmath4fe .",
    "if this is true , this has important consequences in physics and astrophysics @xcite leading e.g.  to the possibility of so called `` strange stars '' @xcite which are neutron stars purely consisting of quark matter in weak equilibrium with electrons .",
    "of course , to check the model dependence of such findings it is important to perform the corresponding calculations also in models different from the mit bag model . in a recent work by buballa and oertel",
    "@xcite the equation of state ( eos ) of quark matter was investigated in the framework of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with three quark flavors . applying this model",
    "it was found that strange quark matter is not absolutely stable .",
    "this would rule out the existence of strange stars .",
    "on the other hand , the possibility of quark phases in the interior of neutron stars is in principle not excluded by this result  even though this possibility gets energetically less likely .",
    "only a detailed phase transition calculation can answer the question which effect the findings in @xcite have on the existence of quark phases inside neutron stars .",
    "this is what we are aiming at in the present work .    in principle , for the description of a neutron star which consists of a quark phase in its center and a surrounding hadronic phase ( and , as we shall discuss below , a mixed phase in between ) we need models for both phases .",
    "the most favorite case would be to have one model which can reliably describe both phases .",
    "so far , there are no such models .",
    "therefore , we will use various versions of the relativistic mean field model to parametrize the hadronic phase . for the quark phase we follow buballa and oertel @xcite in using the three - flavor version of the njl model .",
    "the njl model has proved to be very successful in the description of the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry exhibited by the true ( nonperturbative ) qcd vacuum .",
    "it explains very well the spectrum of the low lying mesons which is intimately connected with chiral symmetry as well as many other low energy phenomena of strong interaction @xcite . at high enough temperature and/or density",
    "the njl model predicts a transition to a state where chiral symmetry becomes restored . despite that promising features which at first sight might suggest the njl model as a good candidate for modeling both the low and high density region of a neutron star this model has one important shortcoming , namely it does not confine quarks . at low densities , however , the bulk properties of strongly interacting matter are significantly influenced by the fact that quarks are confined there .",
    "therefore , we can not expect that the njl model gives reliable results for the eos at low densities .",
    "thus we will use the relativistic mean field model to describe the confined phase . at higher densities , however , the quarks are expected to be deconfined .",
    "there we expect the njl model to be applicable since the lack of confinement inherent to this model is irrelevant in that regime .",
    "the interesting feature of the njl model is that it reflects the chiral symmetry of qcd . clearly , it would be preferable to have a lagrangian for the hadronic phase which also respects chiral symmetry like e.g.  the one constructed in @xcite for the two - flavor case and the su(3 ) generalizations @xcite .",
    "such lagrangians , however , are more complicated to deal with .",
    "first applications to neutron star matter seem to indicate that the modifications are rather small as compared to the relativistic mean field models used here @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we therefore will restrict our considerations to the much simpler extensions of the walecka model which include hyperonic degrees of freedom ( relativistic mean field models ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : hp ] we discuss how the eos for the hadronic phase of a neutron star is calculated within several variants of relativistic mean field models .",
    "we keep brief here since such models are frequently used and well documented in the literature ( cf .",

    "[ sec : qp ] we apply the njl model to the description of the possible quark phase of the neutron star . here",

    "[ sec : pt ] is devoted to the construction of the phase transition and to the application of the complete eos to the internal structure of the neutron star .",
    "finally we summarize and discuss our results in sec .",

    "neutron stars cover a wide range of densities . from the surface of the star which is composed of iron with a density of @xmath5g/@xmath6 the density can increase up to several times normal nuclear matter density in the center of the star .",
    "since there is no single theory that covers this huge density range , we are forced to use different models to meet the requirements of the various degrees of freedom opened up at different densities .",
    "for subnuclear densities we apply the baym - pethick - sutherland eos @xcite .",
    "the degrees of freedom in this eos are nuclei , electrons and neutrons .",
    "the background of neutrons appears above neutron drip density ( @xmath7 ) when the most weakly bound neutrons start to drip out of the nuclei which themselves get more and more neutron rich with increasing density . for a detailed discussion of the baym - pethick - sutherland eos see also @xcite .",
    "we also refer to @xcite where a relativistic mean field model is extended to also describe this low density range .    at densities of about normal nuclear density",
    "@xmath8 the nuclei begin to dissolve and merge together and nucleons become the relevant degrees of freedom in this phase .",
    "we want to describe this phase in the framework of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model which is widely used for the description of dense nuclear matter @xcite . for an introduction to the rmf model see e.g.@xcite .",
    "we use three eos s calculated by schaffner and mishustin in the extended rmf model @xcite ( denoted as tm1 , tm2 , gl85 ) and one by gosh , phatak and sahu @xcite .",
    "for the latter one we use gps as an abbreviation .",
    "these models include hyperonic degrees of freedom which typically appear at @xmath9 @xmath8 .",

    "the use of different hadronic models should reflect this uncertainty to some degree . in the following",

    "@xmath39 is a @xmath40 matrix in flavor space .",
    "for simplicity we use the isospin symmetric case , @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 matrices act in flavor space .",
    "for @xmath43 they are the generators of @xmath44 while @xmath45 is proportional to the unit matrix in flavor space ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the four - point interaction term @xmath46 is symmetric in @xmath47 .",
    "in contrast , the determinant term @xmath48 which for the case of three flavors generates a six - point interaction breaks the @xmath49 symmetry .",
    "if the mass terms are neglected the overall symmetry of the lagrangian therefore is @xmath50 . in vacuum",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken down to @xmath51 which implies the strict conservation of baryon and flavor number .",
    "the full chiral symmetry  which implies in addition the conservation of the axial flavor current  becomes restored at sufficiently high temperatures and/or densities .",
    "the finite mass terms introduce an additional explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry . on account of the chiral symmetry breaking mechanism",
    "the quarks get constituent quark masses which in vacuum are considerable larger than their current quark mass values . in media with very high quark densities constituent and current quark masses",
    "become approximately the same ( concerning the strange quarks this density regime lies far beyond the point where chiral symmetry is restored ) .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 appearing in ( [ eq : nambulag ] ) have dimension energy@xmath54 and energy@xmath55 , respectively . to regularize divergent loop integrals we use for simplicity a sharp cut - off @xmath56 in 3-momentum space .",
    "thus we have at all five parameters , namely the current quark masses @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the coupling constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the cut - off @xmath56 .",

    "these parameters are chosen such that the empirical values for the pion decay constant and the meson masses of pion , kaon and @xmath64 can be reproduced .",
    "the mass of the @xmath65 meson is underestimated by about 6% .",

    "this treatment is identical to a leading order calculation in the inverse number of colors @xmath79 @xcite . in principle",
    ", one can go beyond this approximation by taking into account @xmath79 corrections in a systematic way .",
    "this amounts in the inclusion of quark - antiquark states ( mesons ) as rpa modes in the thermodynamical calculations @xcite .",
    "several things then change : first of all , these mesons might contribute to the eos .",
    "we are not aware of a thorough discussion of such an eos for three flavors with finite current quark masses .",
    "the two - flavor case is discussed in @xcite .",
    "qualitatively the masses of the meson states rise above the chiral transition point .",
    "therefore , they should become energetically disfavored and thus less important .",
    "an additional technical complication arises due to the fact that the relation between the fermi energy and the chemical potential becomes nontrivial . instead of ( [ eq : fermimom ] )",
    "one has to solve an additional gap equation for each flavor species .",
    "these gap equations are coupled to the gap equations for the constituent quark masses given in ( [ eq : gap ] ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details . for simplicity",
    "we will restrict ourselves in the following to the hartree approximation and comment on the possible limitations of that approach in the last section .",
    "coming back to the eos we also need the energy density and the pressure of the quark system .",

    "the appearance of the density independent constant @xmath87 ensures that energy density and pressure vanish in vacuum .",
    "we note here that this requirement fixes the density independent part of @xmath82 which influences the eos via ( [ eq : endensq ] ) , ( [ eq : pressq ] ) and therefore the possible phase transition to quark matter .",
    "we will come back to this point in the last section . in",
    "what follows we shall frequently compare the results of the three - flavor njl model with the simpler mit bag model @xcite .",
    "for that purpose it is important to realize that the njl model predicts a ( density dependent ) bag pressure @xmath82 while in the mit bag model the bag constant @xmath3 is a density independent free parameter .",
    "there usually also the quark masses @xmath88 are treated as density independent quantities .",
    "( an exception is the model discussed in @xcite which uses density dependent effective quark masses caused by quark interactions in the high density regime . ) in the bag model energy density and pressure of the quark system are given by @xmath89 and @xmath90 suppose now that the densities are so high that in the three - flavor njl model the effective quark masses have dropped down to the current quark masses . in this case ,",
    "energy density and pressure take the form of the respective expressions in the mit bag model with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "however , a word of caution is in order here . for _ very high _ quark particle number densities the corresponding fermi momenta become larger than the momentum cut - off @xmath56 introduced to regularize the njl model . in this case",
    "the results of the njl model become unreliable .",
    "e.g.  the upper limit of the momentum integration in ( [ eq : numbdens ] ) would be no longer given by the fermi momentum but by the cut - off @xmath56 which would be clearly an unphysical behavior of the model .",

    "the qp which might be found in the center of a neutron star consists of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 quarks and electrons in weak equilibrium , i.e.  the weak reactions @xmath93 imply relations between the four chemical potentials @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96",
    ", @xmath97 which read @xmath98 since the neutrinos can diffuse out of the star their chemical potentials are taken to be zero . the number of chemical potentials necessary for the description of the qp in weak equilibrium is therefore reduced to _ two _ independent ones . for convenience we choose the pair ( @xmath99 , @xmath97 ) with the neutron chemical potential @xmath100 in a pure qp ( in contrast to quark matter in a mixed phase which we will discuss later ) we can require the qp to be charge neutral .",
    "this gives us an additional constraint on the chemical potentials via the following relation for the particle number densities : @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the electron particle number density .",

    "at this point it should be noted that the arguments given here for the qp also holds for the hp .",
    "there one also ends up with _ two _ independent chemical potentials ( e.g.  @xmath99 and @xmath97 ) if one only requires weak equilibrium between the constituents of the hp and with _ one _ chemical potential ( e.g.  @xmath99 ) if one additionally requires charge neutrality . as we will discuss later",

    "note that we start already at a density as high as two times nuclear saturation density @xmath108@xmath109 since we want to describe only the high density regime of the neutron star with quark degrees of freedom while for low densities we use the hadronic eos described in the previous section .",
    "concerning the low density regime of the three - flavor njl model we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "there it was shown that the energy per baryon of a charge neutral system of quarks and electrons in weak equilibrium ( described by the njl model and a free electron gas ) shows a minimum somewhat above two times @xmath110 .",
    "this implies that in the density region below this minimum the pressure is negative .",

    "note that all condensates have negative values ( cf .",
    "( ) ) . one might wonder why the dropping of the condensates of the light up and down quarks does not decrease the strange quark mass ( and condensate ) due to the last coupling term in ( [ eq : gap ] ) . indeed , strange quark mass and condensate have dropped in the low density region ( not shown here ) from their vacuum values down to the plateaus shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : qqrho ] , [ fig : mrho ] due to their coupling to the up and down quark condensates .",

    "we find that the results of the njl model calculation can not be reproduced by a bag model using the current strange quark mass  no matter which bag pressure is chosen . as already discussed above , the reason simply is that in the njl model up to four times @xmath110 there are no strange quarks in a system which is in weak equilibrium ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : pfrho ] ) . on the other hand , in bag models using the much lower current strange quark mass",
    "one finds a reasonable amount of strange quarks already at vanishing pressure which typically corresponds to @xmath119 times @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that , a bag model with the plateau values for bag pressure and strange quark mass ( denoted as `` mit '' in the figures ) yields a very good approximation to the njl result for the energy per baryon up to @xmath120 times @xmath110 . for higher",

    "this is due to the use of the much larger effective strange quark mass of @xmath118mev in the latter case as compared to the current strange quark mass of @xmath122mev used in the former .",

    "[ fig : peps ] is reasonably well described by mit bag models with the plateau value @xmath121mev no matter which quark masses are chosen ( current or effective quark masses ) .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath124 relation is not very sensitive to the quark masses .",

    "[ fig : earho ] and [ fig : pmub ] .    before constructing the phase transition inside the neutron star",
    "let us briefly discuss the limitations of the njl model in the form as we have treated it here .",
    "as a typical low energy theory the njl model is not renormalizable .",
    "this is not an obstacle since such theories by construction should be only applied to low energy problems . in practice",
    "the results depend on the chosen cut - off or , to turn the argument around , the njl model is only properly defined once a cut - off has been chosen .",
    "this cut - off serves as a limit for the range of applicability of the model .",
    "here we have used one cut - off @xmath56 for the three - momenta of all quark species . concerning the discussion of other cut - off schemes and their interrelations we refer to @xcite . when the density in the quark phase gets higher the fermi momenta of the quarks rise due to the pauli principle .",
    "eventually they might overwhelm the cut - off of the njl model .",
    "at least beyond that point the model is no longer applicable .",
    "we have made sure in our calculations that this point is never reached ( cf .",
    "[ fig : pfrho ] ) .",
    "in addition , at very high densities one presumably enters a regime which might be better described by ( resummed ) perturbation theory .",
    "while the nonperturbative features of the njl model vanish with rising density , medium effects as mediated e.g.  by one - gluon exchange grow with the density @xcite . to summarize , concerning the calculation of the eos it turns out that the njl model should neither be used at low densities where confinement properties are important nor at very high densities where the njl model as a low energy theory leaves its range of applicability .",
    "however , the njl model might yield reasonable results in a window of the density range where confinement is no longer crucial but chiral symmetry as a symmetry of full qcd remains to be important .",
    "in the previous sections we have discussed the underlying eos s thought to reflect the properties of confined hadronic matter ( hp ) and deconfined quark matter ( qp ) in its particular regime of applicability . applying these eos",
    "s we want to calculate in this section the phase transition from the hp to the qp to see which phase is the favored one at which densities .",
    "( the existence of a qp inside the neutron star of course requires the phase transition density to be smaller than the central density of the star . )",
    "it is worth to point out which phase structure is in principle possible if a hadronic model and the njl model are connected at a certain density value @xmath125 ( which is dynamically determined in the present work by a gibbs construction as we shall discuss below ) . at density @xmath125",
    "we assume a first order phase transition from confined hadronic to deconfined quark matter . even without a matching to a hadronic model the njl model already exhibits a transition , namely from a low density system with broken chiral symmetry to a high density system where chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "the respective density is denoted by @xmath126 . for densities larger than @xmath126 the goldstone bosons which characterize the chirally broken phase are no longer stable but can decay into quark - antiquark pairs . if @xmath126 was larger than @xmath125 the following scenario would be conceivable : there would be three phases , namely ( i ) a hadronic , i.e.  confined phase at low densities , ( ii ) a phase where quarks are deconfined but massive ( in this phase e.g.  pions would still appear as bound states ) , and ( iii ) a high density phase where quarks are deconfined and their masses are so low that all mesons can decay into quarks .",
    "had we neglected all current quark masses , the quarks in the third phase would be exactly massless . with finite current quark masses , however , the constituent quark masses keep on dropping with rising density in the third phase ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mrho ] ) .",
    "this definitely interesting scenario with three phases is not realized in our model .",
    "it turns out that the deconfinement phase transition happens far beyond the chiral transition , i.e.  @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , only the phases ( i ) and ( iii ) appear here .    in principle",
    ", since we assume the deconfinement phase transition to be of first order these two phases can coexist in a mixed phase .",
    "indeed , it was first pointed out by glendenning that beside a hp and a qp also this mixed phase ( mp ) of quark and hadronic matter may exist inside neutron stars @xcite .",
    "( for a discussion of the geometrical structure of the mp and its consequences for the properties of neutron stars see @xcite . )",
    "this possibility was not realized in previous calculations due to an inadequate treatment of neutron star matter as a one - component system ( one which can be parameterized by only one chemical potential ) .",
    "as we have already discussed , the treatment of neutron star matter as a charge neutral phase in weak equilibrium indeed reduces the number of independent chemical potentials to one .",
    "but the essential point is that - if a mp exists - charge neutrality can be achieved in this phase e.g.  with a positively charged amount of hadronic matter and a negatively charged amount of quark matter .",
    "therefore it is not justified to require charge neutrality in both phases separately . in doing",
    "so we would `` freeze out '' a degree of freedom which in principle could be exploited in the mp by rearranging electric charge between both phases to reach `` global '' charge neutrality . a correct treatment of the phase transition therefore only requires both phases to be in weak equilibrium , i.e.  both phases still depend on two independent chemical potentials .",
    "we have chosen the pair ( @xmath99 , @xmath97 ) .",
    "such a system is called a two - component system .",
    "the gibbs condition for mechanical and chemical equilibrium at zero temperature between both phases of the two - component system reads @xmath128 using eq .",
    "( [ gibbscondition ] ) we can calculate the equilibrium chemical potentials of the mp where @xmath129 holds .",
    "fig.[p3d ] illustrates this calculation .",
    "the hp@xmath130mp phase transition takes place if the pressure of the charge neutral hp ( white line ) meets the pressure surface of the qp ( njl ) . up to this point",
    "the pressure of the qp is below the pressure of the hp making the hp the physically realized one . at higher pressure",
    "the physically realized phase follows the mp curve which is given by the gibbs condition ( [ gibbscondition ] ) .",
    "finally the mp curve meets the charge neutral qp curve ( white line ) and the pressure of the qp is above the pressure of the hp , making the qp the physically realized one . for every point on the mp curve one",
    "now can calculate the volume proportion @xmath131 occupied by quark matter in the mp by imposing the condition of global charge neutrality of the mp @xmath132 here @xmath133 and @xmath134 denote the respective charge densities . from this",
    ", the energy density @xmath135 of the mp can be calculated by @xmath136 along the mp curve the volume proportion occupied by quark matter is monotonically increasing from @xmath137 to @xmath138 where the transition to the pure qp takes place .    taking ( i ) the charge neutral eos of the hp at low densities ( sec .

    "we denote this eos as the _ hybrid star _ eos . fig .",
    "[ pepsgps ] shows this eos if we apply gps for the hp eos .",
    "the hybrid star eos consists of three distinct parts . at low densities ( @xmath140 ) matter",

    "is composed of a mixed phase of hadronic and quark matter .",
    "this mp part of the eos is shaded gray . only at unaccessible high densities ( @xmath142 )",
    "matter consists of a pure qp .",
    "the preceding statements refer to the use of gps for the eos of the hp . concerning all the other variants of rmf used here ( tm1 , tm2 , gl85 ) we have found that the hp@xmath130mp transition does not appear below @xmath143 .",
    "as we will discuss below such high energy densities can not be reached inside a stable neutron star which is described by one of these eos .    at this point",
    "we should note the essential difference between the treatment of neutron star matter as a one- and a two - component system ( cf .",
    "while the former one leads to the well known phase transition with a constant pressure mp ( like in the familiar liquid - gas phase transition of water ) , we can see in fig.[pepsgps ] that the pressure is monotonically increasing even in the mp if we apply the correct two - component treatment .",
    "this has an important consequence on the structure of the neutron star . since we know from the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium ",
    "the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations @xcite  that the pressure has to increase if we go deeper into the star , a constant pressure mp is strictly excluded from the star while a mp with increasing pressure can ( in principle ) occupy a finite range inside the star .    to see if the densities inside a neutron star are high enough to establish a mp or a qp in its center we have to solve the tov equations with a specified hybrid star eos following from our phase transition calculation . from the solutions of the tov equations we get a relation between the central energy density ( or central pressure ) and the mass of the neutron star ( cf .",
    "[ fig : meps ] ) .    the maximum possible central energy density ( the critical energy density @xmath144 )",
    "is reached at the maximum mass that is supported by the fermi pressure of the particular hybrid star eos . above this critical density",
    "the neutron star gets instable with respect to radial modes of oscillations @xcite .",
    "we have applied the four hp eos s ( denoted by gps , tm1 , tm2 and gl85 ) to calculate the four corresponding hybrid star eos s .",
    "( the one for gps is shown in fig.[pepsgps ] . )",
    "we found that in _ no _ eos the central energy density of a typical @xmath145 neutron star is large enough for a deconfinement phase transition .",
    "( here @xmath146 denotes the mass of the sun . )",
    "the corresponding neutron stars are purely made of hadronic matter ( hp ) . in fig .",
    "[ pepsgps ] where gps is used also the neutron star masses are shown as a function of the central energy density . there",
    "the central energy density of a @xmath147 is about @xmath148 which is clearly below @xmath141 which is at least necessary to yield a mp core .",
    "( this is also shown in the context of the gibbs construction in fig.[p3d ] where the central pressure of a @xmath147 and of a @xmath149 neutron star is marked . ) in fig .",
    "[ pepsgps ] we can see that only near the maximum mass of @xmath150 neutron stars with a mp core are possible .",
    "this , however , only holds for the gps hybrid star eos and only in a quite narrow mass range from @xmath151 . in the density range up to the critical density all other eos s ( tm1 , tm2 , gl85 )",
    "do not show a phase transition at all .",
    "the critical energy densities for these eos s are in the range of @xmath152 while the densities for the hp@xmath130mp transition are above @xmath143 .",
    "( the corresponding maximum masses are @xmath153 . ) from this we conclude that within the model constructed here the appearance of deconfined quark matter in the center of neutron stars turns out to be very unlikely .",
    "we have studied the possible phase transition inside neutron stars from confined to deconfined matter . for the description of the quark phase we have utilized",
    "the njl model which respects chiral symmetry and yields dynamically generated quark masses via the effect of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we found that the appearance of deconfined quark matter in the center of a neutron star appears to be very unlikely , for most of the studied hadronic eos s even impossible .",
    "the ultimate reason for that effect is the high value of the effective strange quark mass which turns out to be much higher than its current mass value in the whole relevant density range ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mrho ] ) .",
    "this finding , of course , is based on several assumptions which need not necessarily be correct . in lack of an eos based on a full qcd calculation at zero temperature and finite nuclear density , we had to rely on simpler models for the eos in different density regimes .    concerning the low density regime we have used various relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models .",
    "to some degree the use of different variants of the rmf model should reflect the uncertainties of this approach .",
    "these models are generalizations of the walecka model @xcite which describes the hadronic ground state of nuclear matter at density @xmath110 quite successfully . at somewhat higher densities",
    "the used rmf models deal with hyperons as additional degrees of freedom .",
    "since these rmf models do not have any explicit quark degrees of freedom we expect them to become unreliable at high densities where the confinement forces are screened and the hadrons dissolve into quarks .    to describe this high density regime we have utilized the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model in its three - flavor extension .",
    "the merits of the njl model are ( at least ) twofold : for the vacuum case , it gives a reasonable description of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and of the spectrum of the low lying mesons .",
    "for sufficiently high density and/or temperature , the njl model exhibits the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "a shortcoming of the njl model is that it does not confine quarks , i.e.  there is no mechanism which prevents the propagation of a single quark in vacuum .",
    "therefore in an njl model calculation the quarks significantly contribute to the eos also at low densities .",
    "this was the ultimate reason why we considered the njl model only in the high density regime where confinement is supposed to be absent anyway while utilizing the hadronic rmf models to describe the confined phase . on the other hand",
    ", we should recall that energy density and pressure of the njl model were determined such that both vanish at zero density , i.e.  in a regime where we have not utilized the njl model afterwards .",
    "this procedure determines the effective bag pressure @xmath82 given in ( [ eq : defeffbag ] ) by fixing @xmath87 ( [ eq : defb0 ] ) to @xmath154 . clearly , this procedure is somewhat unsatisfying since the effective bag pressure @xmath82 influences the eos and therefore the onset of the phase transition . indeed ,",
    "if we reduce @xmath87 by only @xmath155% by hand from its original value of @xmath154 we already observe drastic changes in the phase structure of the neutron star favoring deconfined quark matter . on the other hand , the physical requirement that any model should yield vanishing energy density and pressure in vacuum is the only way to uniquely determine the eos of the njl model without any further assumptions .",
    "possible alternatives to the use of the njl model for the description of the deconfined quark matter are the mit bag model @xcite and the extended effective mass bag model @xcite .",
    "the latter includes medium effects due to one - gluon exchange which rise with density ( while the effective masses of the njl model decrease ) . as already discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : qp ] for the regime of very high densities such a resummed perturbation theory might be more adequate .",
    "furthermore , mit bag models can be very useful in interpreting more involved models like the njl model in terms of simple physical quantities like the bag constant and the quark masses .",
    "therefore we have frequently compared our njl model results with the mit bag model in sec .  [",
    "sec : qp ] .",
    "for a further discussion of the mit bag model and its application to neutron stars see @xcite .",
    "the distinct feature of the njl model is that nonperturbative effects are still present beyond the phase transition point .",
    "it is reasonable to consider such effects since it was found in lattice calculations @xcite that for qcd at finite temperature the eos beyond the phase transition point can neither be properly described by a free gas of quarks and gluons nor by qcd perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "presumably this holds also for the finite density regime . on the mean field level",
    "the most prominent nonperturbative feature of the njl model which remains present beyond the phase transition point is the constituent strange quark mass which is much larger than the current strange quark mass in the whole relevant density regime ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mrho ] ) .",
    "this high strange quark mass has turned out to be crucial for the phase transition .",
    "as we have shown above the eos of the qp can be reasonably well approximated by an mit bag eos up to 5 times @xmath110 using a comparatively low bag constant of @xmath121mev and an effective strange quark mass of @xmath118mev .",
    "these are the plateau values of the corresponding quantities in the njl model calculations shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mrho ] and [ fig : brho ] . in figs .",
    "[ fig : earho]-[fig : peps ] the curves labeled by mit use these values for the bag constant and the effective strange quark mass .",
    "using such a bag constant in connection with the _ current _ strange quark mass would allow the existence of a qp inside a neutron star @xcite .",
    "this , however , does not remain true once a much higher effective strange quark mass is used .",
    "qualitatively , the chain of arguments is that a higher mass leads to a lower pressure ( cf .",
    "[ fig : pmub ] ) .",
    "this disfavors the quark phase in the gibbs construction , i.e.  shifts the phase transition point to higher densities .",
    "this is the reason why in our calculations the existence of quark matter in the center of a neutron star is ( nearly ) excluded . especially for typical neutron stars with masses",
    "@xmath156 the central energy density is far below the deconfinement phase transition density ( cf .",
    "[ fig : peps ] ) .",
    "this finding is independent of the choice of the version of the rmf model .",
    "this suggests that it is the njl model with its large strange quark mass which defers the onset of the deconfinement phase transition rather than the modeling of the hadronic phase . throughout this work we have used the njl parameter set of @xcite .",
    "we have also explored the set given in @xcite with @xmath157mev , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160mev , and @xmath161mev .",
    "the results are very similar to the ones presented here .    for simplicity",
    "we have treated in the present work the njl model in the hartree approximation . in principle , going beyond the mean field approximation might influence the order of the chiral phase transition ( for related work towards that direction for the two - flavor case cf .",
    "if it turned out that this would result in a strong first order phase transition then the effective strange quark mass might change more drastically and in the region of interest would be perhaps much lower than in the case studied in the present work .",
    "this would favor the appearance of quark matter in the interior of neutron stars .",
    "clearly , it would be interesting to study how a more involved treatment of the njl model beyond the hartree approximation would influence our findings presented here .",
