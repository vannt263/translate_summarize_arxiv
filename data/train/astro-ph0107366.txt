    "over the last five years the rotation curves of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies and the constraints they impose on cosmological theories have received much attention in the literature .",
    "an lsb galaxy is usually defined as a disk galaxy with an extrapolated central disk surface brightness @xmath1 mag arcsec@xmath2 fainter than the typical value for `` normal '' high surface brightness ( hsb ) spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "colors , metallicities , gas - fractions , and extensive population synthesis modelling all support the idea that lsb galaxies are unevolved galaxies with low ( current and past ) star formation rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "the observation that lsb and hsb galaxies follow the same tully - fisher ( tf ) relation requires ( in the conventional picture ) that lsb galaxies are dominated by dark matter ( dm ) @xcite . for reasonable stellar mass - to - light ratios @xmath3  low surface brightness implies low stellar density . yet , the extended , low surface density stellar disks can not be the major contributors to the dynamics in lsb galaxies , as no shift in the zero - point of the tf relation with surface brightness is observed .",
    "this contrasts with the dominance of the stellar population in hsb galaxies of similar luminosity .",
    "the modest @xmath3  values as implied by the blue colors and the ( baryonic ) tf relation , together with the diffuseness of the stellar disks make analyses of the dm distribution in lsb galaxies less ambiguous than in hsb galaxies where the stellar component can be significant even for fairly low @xmath3  values .",
    "lsb galaxies are therefore ideal laboratories for measuring the distribution of dark matter for comparison with predictions of theories of galaxy formation .",
    "for example , one of the results of numerical cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations is a so - called `` universal halo mass density profile '' @xcite , commonly known as a `` nfw profile . ''",
    "nfw ( and all cdm ) mass density profiles are characterized by steep central cusps .",
    "this is in contrast with the other commonly used `` classic '' pseudo - isothermal sphere halo model which is characterized by a constant density core .",
    "the parameters of the nfw mass density distribution are related to the mass of the halo and the density of the universe at the time of collapse and are therefore set by the cosmology . as these parameters can be determined from observations ,",
    "this opens the possibility of testing the nfw cdm model as well its underlying assumptions .    a first analysis of lsb galaxy hi  rotation curves by @xcite indicated that they did not rise as steeply as their hsb counterparts of similar luminosity , contrary to cdm predictions .",
    "the mass distribution in lsb galaxies is more extended and of lower density than in hsb galaxies @xcite .",
    "other results also indicate that the steep rotation curves implied by cdm are hard to reconcile with the observed shallow rotation curves of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "to explain this discrepancy the possibility of redistribution of the ( cuspy ) dm due to violent star - formation ( thus creating the observed cores ) was sometimes raised , but this has been shown to be inconsistent with other observational data @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the shapes of rotation curves of lsb galaxies were inconsistent with those predicted by the nfw prescription .",
    "this could not be explained by the effects of star formation as the larger masses of lsb galaxies would require large bursts in order to redistribute matter on large scales .",
    "their quiescent evolutionary history argues strongly against this @xcite .    this comparison with the cdm model is often dismissed because of the limited resolution of the observed hi  curves .",
    "the early hi  lsb rotation curves were obtained using the vla and wsrt radio synthesis telescopes .",
    "the relatively large beams of these instruments resulted in rotation curves with only a limited resolution .",
    "@xcite did however show that for the best resolved cases the effects of beam smearing were not strong enough to explain the observed shallow curve as simply the result of a steep nfw model curve affected by beam - smearing .",
    "similar results were found for more fashionable cosmologies , such as @xmath0cdm ( @xmath4 ) , though with smaller discrepancies .",
    "even so , the theoretical debate now seems to have settled on halos with cusps even steeper than nfw halos @xcite , thus worsening the possible conflict between the data and the simulations . from the observational point of view",
    "the easiest and least ambigous way to test the reality of these discrepancies is to measure high - resolution rotation curves .",
    "optical h@xmath5 rotation curves of five lsb galaxies from the sample of @xcite ( bmh ) were presented in @xcite ( smt ) . though smt found that for two of the five galaxies the inner slopes of the rotation curves were steeper than derived from the hi  observations , this difference does not affect the bmh conclusion that lsb rotation curves have shallower slopes than hsb rotation curves of similar amplitude .",
    "because of these steeper slopes , smt derive higher maximum - disk @xmath3  values ( in some cases @xmath6 ) , strengthening one of the conclusions from @xcite that the maximum @xmath3values in lsb galaxies are too large to be accommodated by reasonable star formation histories and initial mass functions .",
    "such high values are inconsistent with the existence of a baryonic tf - relation @xcite .",
    "a different approach was taken by @xcite .",
    "they attempted to apply a rigorous correction for beamsmearing to the bmh hi  data , and thus to derive the true `` infinite resolution '' rotation curve .",
    "they conclude that the data are not of high enough resolution to accept or reject the nfw hypothesis with any significance . however , as they use a modified nfw profile with the inner slope of the mass - density distribution as an ( additional ) free parameter , it is not clear how significant this conclusion is .",
    "the usual 3-parameter rotation curve fits are already under - constrained ; adding another parameter does not improve the significance of the results .",
    "furthermore , in some cases they find such low values for the inner slope that their nfw - halos effectively become core - dominated .",
    "these halos do of course fit the data , but do not occur in cdm simulations .",
    "the general picture as derived from early observations of rotation curves of lsb galaxies therefore still holds : lsb galaxies are unevolved , low density galaxies , dominated by dm .",
    "their rotation curves have shallower slopes than those of hsb galaxies of similar amplitude , and the shape of the best - resolved lsb curves are not necessarily consistent with the nfw rotation curve shapes .      in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of high - resolution high - quality hybrid h@xmath5/hi  rotation curves of a sample of 30 lsb galaxies . of this sample",
    "26 curves were taken from the large sample of 50 lsb galaxies presented in mcgaugh , rubin & de blok ( 2001 ) ( herafter paper i ) . in that paper an extensive description is given of the data , the sample and reduction method .",
    "we also refer to that paper for a comparison of the new h@xmath5 data with the bmh hi  curves .",
    "we also re - analyse the data for an additional 5 curves taken from @xcite . in this paper",
    "we derive mass models under various assumptions for @xmath3  and fit these models both with nfw halos and pseudo - isothermal halos .",
    "a similar analysis for a different set of rotation curves of dwarf and lsb galaxies is given in de blok & bosma ( 2001 ) .",
    "in section 2 we discuss the sample , and discuss the derivation of the rotation curves .",
    "we also show internal and external comparisons of the data and discuss possible systematics . in section 3",
    "we discuss the various mass models .",
    "section 4 contains the results of the model fitting .",
    "section 5 discusses the implications for the various halo models . in section 6",
    "we turn our attention to the maximum disk and a summary is given in section 7 .",
    "when using absolute distances we have used a hubble constant @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "the data and reduction methods have been extensively described in paper i. in summary , we use long - slit major axis spectra taken with the 4-m telescope at kitt peak in june 1999 and february 2000 and the 100@xmath9 telescope at las campanas in november 1998 .",
    "velocities were derived from the intensity weighted centroid of the h@xmath5 and [ nii ] lines .    as the aim of this excercise is to derive mass models which can yield significant constraints on the distribution of dm we select only the 26 high quality galaxies from paper i. we split this high - quality sample in two sub - samples .",
    "sample i contains lsb galaxies from bmh and @xcite for which a full set of photometry and hi  data is available . in sample",
    "i we also include the five galaxies presented in smt . for these galaxies hi  and optical photometry",
    "are taken from bmh .",
    "tables  [ fgalsample ] and [ esosample ] contain a full list of the galaxies analysed here , along with some of their global parameters .",
    "sample ii consists of eso - lv and ugc lsb galaxies , for which an optical rotation curve is available but no optical or hi  photometry .    for the galaxies in sample i , hi  observations are available which often extend to larger radii than the h@xmath5 data .",
    "to make the best use of both types of data , we have constructed hybrid rotation curves .",
    "these consist of the h@xmath5 data over the range of radii where available , and 21-cm data to define the outermost points .",
    "no attempt has been made to `` average '' the different types of data : h@xmath5 is given precedence over the range of radii where it is available .",
    "one of the main assumptions made when deriving mass models from rotation curves is that the gas and stars trace circular orbits in an axisymmetric potential .",
    "though the shape of the optical rotation curves in paper i is well - defined , the scatter between individual datapoints means we can not simply use the raw rotation curves to estimate the radial run of the gravitational potential . for this one needs a smooth curve which retains real small - scale details , but without the observational scatter .",
    "the method most often used to produce these smooth curves is to fit splines to the data .",
    "here we use have used a robust version of this procedure ( local regression , see loader 1999 ) .",
    "the smooth curves were rebinned to a bin width of 2@xmath9 .",
    "the error bars in the rebinned data points consist of two components : one due to observational errors caused by the measurement uncertainties in the individual raw datapoints ( for this we use the average weighted measurement error in each bin ) , and an additional component caused by differences between approaching and receding sides and non - circular motions ( which we define as the difference between the weighted mean raw velocity and the velocity implied by the spline fit at that radius ) . for the final error estimate",
    "these two uncertainties were added quadratically .",
    "for some high s / n data points the error bars become unrealistically small ( sometimes less than 1 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "this has no physical significance and simply tells us that the profile centroids were well - determined .",
    "these small error bars can however easily dominate any model fit and can severely bias @xmath10 values or goodness - of - fit parameters .",
    "for this reason , and as the observational and physical uncertainties ( slit position , streaming motions ) make it difficult to determine a physically meaningful rotation velocity with an accuracy of more than a few km s@xmath8 , we have imposed a minimum error on each point of 4 km s@xmath8 ( before inclination correction ) . the curves were corrected for inclination using the values given in tables  [ fgalsample ] and [ esosample ] .    the end result is a smooth representation of the data , which is reproducible and as objective as possible , to use as input for the mass models .",
    "figure  [ smoraw ] show overlays of both the raw hybrid curves and the smooth versions .",
    "it is easy to verify that no systematic differences in slope or shape have been introduced .",
    "the error bars in the smooth curves are also a good representation of the uncertainties in the underlying raw data .",
    "table  [ electable ] contains the hybrid smooth rotation curves . for each galaxy",
    "we list the radii in arcsec , as well as in kpc , together with the observed rotation velocities and the uncertainties in these values .",
    "also included are the rotation curves for the gas component ( already included is the factor 1.4 mass scaling for he ) , the disk component ( values listed assume @xmath11 ) , and where applicable the bulge component ( also for @xmath11 .",
    "as noted above , we have included the five lsb galaxies presented in smt in our sample i. as smt show their raw data and derived smooth curves , we can compare both sets of smooth rotation curves to investigate possible systematics in our respective methods .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ swcomp ] .",
    "it is clear that the correspondence between both velocities and errorbars is good and the differences are minor . in most cases ( f568 - 1 , f568-v1 and f574 - 1 ) both sets agree at ( better than ) the 1@xmath12 level .",
    "small remaining differences are usually caused by a slightly different estimate of the velocities in sparsely sampled parts ( f563-v2 and f568 - 3 ) .",
    "the smt curve for f563-v2 ( fig .",
    "[ swcomp ] , top - left ) is slightly higher than our curve in the inner parts , but falls below ours in the outer parts .",
    "the sparseness of optical data points in the outer parts and different interpretations of the continuity between hi  and optical data are probably the main cause of this difference . for f568 - 3 ( fig .",
    "[ swcomp ] , bottom ) we find a small ( @xmath13 ) systematic difference between both smooth curves .",
    "this galaxy has been measured independently by smt and by us ( paper i ) .",
    "these raw data sets agree in detail , and the difference must therefore be due to a slightly different interpretation of the sparse raw data . in summary , the smooth curves we present here give a good and reproducable representation of the data .",
    "in order to find the signature of the dark halo one needs to model the observed rotation curve using a number of separate dynamical components , described below .      to model the stellar disk , the @xmath14-band photometry presented in @xcite was used .",
    "the rotation curve of the disk was computed following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the disk was assumed to have a vertical sech@xmath15 distribution with a scale height @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the rotation curves of the stellar component were resampled at the same radii as the smooth curves .",
    "we assume @xmath3  is constant with radius .",
    "while one expects some modest variation in @xmath17 with radius @xcite , the color gradients in lsb galaxies tend to be small , so this effect is not likely to be significant .",
    "the hi  surface density profiles presented in bmh and @xcite were used .",
    "they were scaled by a factor of 1.4 to take the contribution of helium and metals into account .",
    "their rotation curve was derived assuming the gas was distributed in a thin disk .",
    "the gas rotation curves were resampled at the radii of the smooth observed rotation curve .",
    "the dark halo component differs from the previous two in that we are interested in parametrizing this component assuming some fiducial model .",
    "the choice of this model is the crux of most of the dm analyses in the literature , and many models exist .",
    "these can be broadly distinguished in two groups : halo models with a core , and halo models with a cusp .",
    "an example of the first category is the pseudo - isothermal halo , an example of the latter the cdm nfw halo .    as one of the goals of this paper is to assess the relevance of either category to the high - resolution lsb galaxy rotation curves , we will present models derived using both models .",
    "we do realize there are many intermediate models described in the literature that probably can fit our data equally well .",
    "however , our goal here is simply to see where the data lead us : is there a preference for models with a core or with a cusp ?",
    "we now describe the details of both models .",

    "the nfw mass density distribution takes the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the characteristic radius of the halo and @xmath27 is related to the density of the universe at the time of collapse .",
    "this mass distribution gives rise to a halo rotation curve @xmath28}\\right]^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 .",
    "it is characterized by a concentration parameter @xmath30 and a radius @xmath31 .",
    "these are directly related to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but are used instead as they are a convenient way to parametrize the rotation curve .",
    "the radius @xmath31 is the radius where the density contrast exceeds 200 , roughly the virial radius @xcite .",
    "the characteristic velocity @xmath32 of the halo is defined in the same way as @xmath31 .",
    "these parameters are not independent and are set by the cosmology .",
    "one of largest uncertainties in any mass model is the value of @xmath3 .",
    "though broad trends in @xmath3   have been measured and modelled ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the precise value for an individual galaxy is not well known , and depends on extinction , star formation history , initial mass function , etc .",
    "rotation curve fitting is a problem with too many free parameters @xcite and some assumptions regarding @xmath3  must be made .",
    "we therefore present disk - halo decompositions using four different assumptions for @xmath17 for the galaxies in sample i. for the galaxies in sample ii only the minimum - disk model is presented .    * minimum disk . *",
    "this model assumes that the observed rotation curve is due entirely to dm .",
    "this gives an upper limit on how concentrated the dark mass component can actually be and is the version of minimum disk preferred in the cdm literature .",
    "* minimum disk + gas . *",
    "the contribution of the atomic gas ( hi and he ) is taken into account , but @xmath3  is assumed to be zero .",
    "this is the classical definition of minimum disk as used in the hi  rotation curve literature .",
    "* constant @xmath3 .",
    "* here @xmath3  is set equal to a constant value based on an initial mass function and a star formation history appropriate for lsb galaxies . for the range in color @xmath33 which lsb galaxies normally exhibit",
    "@xcite a value @xmath34 is a good estimate .",
    "for example , using the @xcite model with constant star formation rate and salpeter imf , we find that @xmath35 corresponds to @xmath36 . the pegase2 model ( rocca - volmerange , priv .",
    "comm . ) gives a value @xmath37 , whereas the model by @xcite yields @xmath38 .",
    "the models by @xcite give values around @xmath39 .",
    "the value @xmath40 is thus actually at the `` light - weight '' end of the plausible range , but this was deliberately chosen in order to give maximum opportunity for the cuspy nfw models to fit the data .",
    "we realize that the values derived here should not be regarded as definitive : changes in the imf model used or different estimates for internal extinction can lead to different values .",
    "however , here we attempt to derive a conservative estimate for @xmath3  based on the observed properties of the stellar population .",
    "further ( upward ) refinement of the @xmath17 value is thus more likely to cause more problems for nfw fits .",
    "* maximum disk .",
    "* the rotation curve of the stellar component is scaled to the maximum value allowed by the ( smooth ) rotation curve , but with the restriction that the dm density is required to be positive at all radii ( thus avoiding a so - called `` hollow halo '' ) @xcite . because of the different dm distributions that we test ( core and cusp ) this can ocassionally lead to maximum disk values that differ slightly for each of the two models .",
    "a more extensive description is given in  6 .",
    "each of the rotation curves was fitted using the gipsy task rotmas .",
    "the program determines the best - fitting combination of @xmath20 and @xmath22 ( for the pseudo - isothermal halo ) or @xmath41 and @xmath32 ( for the nfw halo ) , using a least squares fitting routine .",
    "we assigned weights to the data points inversely proportional to the square of their uncertainty .",
    "additional checks were made with other fitting programs to check the results of the fits ( discussed in sect .",

    "the resulting halo rotation curve is shown as the long - dashed line .",
    "the final total model curve is drawn as the full line . in each of the model panels we also give the reduced @xmath10 of the fit and the chance @xmath42 that the data and the model could result from the same parent distribution .",

    "values @xmath43 indicate that the data and the model are a good match .",
    "values @xmath44 indicate that the model is incompatible with the data , and that better models can be found .",
    "we show two best - fitting values .",
    "one as found by the linear fit of the gipsy rotmas task ( indicated as a `` plus''-cross ( + ) ) , and one found by finding the minimum in the plotted logarithmic parameter space ( indicated by a `` times''-cross @xmath45 ) .",
    "these two are identical , except when extreme parameter values occur ( usually during maximum disk fits ) and numerical precision of the fitting routine starts to play a role .",
    "this effect is visible in the bottom - right corners of the nfw contour plots , where the very large values of @xmath32 in combination with the small values of @xmath41 cause increasingly ragged contours .",
    "a large difference between these two best values therefore indicates that the fit should not be regarded as definitive .",
    "indeed , in a number of these cases ( indicated in the tables as italic numbers ) the fitting routine was unable to determine a valid solution , and an indicative value had to be chosen by hand .",
    "this happened mostly with the nfw models .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that the inner parts of the rotation curves can be well described by @xmath46 , whereas the nfw model has the form @xmath47 . to accommodate the model , the fit tries to stretch out the nfw curve ( resulting in small @xmath41 and high @xmath32 ) in order to make it _ look _ linear .",
    "the second and fourth columns of panels in fig .",
    "[ nfwiso ] show the 1@xmath12 ( thick contour ) and @xmath48 ( thin contours ) probability contours of the halo parameters in logarithmic space .",
    "the reason for choosing a logarithmic representation is that the @xmath10 distributions for the nfw halo parameters often show extended tails towards very small @xmath41 and/or large @xmath32 . for comparison ,",
    "[ linchi2 ] shows a representative example of the @xmath12-contours for the minimum disk model of f583 - 4 plotted in linear @xmath41-@xmath32 space .",
    "it is important to realize that the @xmath12 contours are plotted _ with respect to the minimum @xmath10_. that is , existence of a narrow distribution only means that the minimum @xmath10 is well defined .",
    "it does _ not _ imply that the fit is good in an absolute sense .",
    "for that one needs to refer to the value of the reduced @xmath10 itself or the probability @xmath42 that the data and model are compatible .",
    "there are many cases where the nfw model is not a good fit , making it difficult to plot absolute likelihood contours .",

    "the rapid rise and subsequent dip in the rotation velocity at small radii clearly suggest the dominance of the bulge in this giant lsb galaxy . we have assumed the bulge to be maximal at @xmath69 .",
    "as the bulge accounts for most of the rotation velocity in the inner parts , this seems to argue against cuspy halos in giant lsb galaxies .",
    "the pseudo - isothermal halos generally provide better fits than the nfw halos . in fig .",
    "[ compchi2 ] we compare the reduced @xmath10 values for the four different @xmath3  cases . for the minimum disk case we plot samples i and ii , for the other cases only sample i is plotted .",
    "it is clear that the large majority of the curves presented here is best fitted by a pseudo - isothermal halo .",
    "this holds true even in the maximum disk case where one might naively expect the dominance of the optical disk to wipe out any discrepancies of a particular halo model ( though perhaps not for lsb galaxies ) .    another way of comparing the models is given in table  [ veratable ] .",
    "this lists the number of galaxies in sample i that have good ( @xmath43 ) or bad ( @xmath44 ) fits for each of the two models . here",
    "again it is clear that the pseudo - isothermal model performs much better , for every assumption of @xmath3 .",

    "if we double ( or halve ) the size of the error bars , @xmath10 will change for both halo cases , but will always remain less for the pseudo - isothermal case . to alter this result would require systematic changes to the shapes of all the rotation curves .",

    "residuals are plotted against halo scale size ( @xmath31 for nfw and @xmath20 for pseudo - isothermal halos ) , radius in kpc , number of optical disk scale lengths and fraction of maximum radius of the rotation curve . as described in the previous section",
    ", the nfw fits that fail do so in a systematic way : the inner velocity is overestimated , then the model drops below the observed velocities in the middle and in the outer parts it once again overpredicts the velocity .",
    "the nfw residuals are most pronounced when plotted against @xmath70 .",
    "the majority of the residuals change sign at @xmath71 and @xmath72 . as the radius @xmath73 does not have any physical significance , but is determined by the observations ( slit angle , presence of h@xmath5 , etc . )",
    "this indicates that the systematics are due to the choice of model , rather than being associated with any particular length scale in the galaxies .",
    "similar conclusions are reached when the residuals are plotted for the min+gas , constant @xmath3  and maximum disk cases .    though this is not readily apparent in fig .",
    "[ nfwiso ] , the residuals for the pseudo - isothermal halo model also show a systematic behaviour , though at a much lower level than the nfw model . here",
    "the residuals do not increase towards the center , and as the typical size of the residuals is smaller than the uncertainty in the individual data points , this just shows us that the rotation curve shape is subtly different from that of a pure pseudo - isothermal halo .",
    "this should come as no surprise given the simplifying assumptions of e.g.minimum disk that we have made .      of the two models investigated ,",
    "the pseudo - isothermal halo best describes the data .",
    "here we briefly explore some correlations between the pseudo - isothermal halo model parameters and the parameters describing the luminous components of the galaxies . to increase the range of the parameters we also consider the samples of @xcite of ( mainly ) luminous hsb galaxies , and @xcite of late - type dwarf galaxies . from these samples we only select bulge - less galaxies brighter than @xmath74 to be consistent with the range of luminosities found in our sample .",
    "[ isocor ] presents the results for the three samples .",
    "we show the min+gas case , which the two comparison samples refer to as their `` minimum disk '' .",
    "the most obvious correlation visible in fig .",
    "[ isocor ] is that between @xmath20 and @xmath19 . this is a reflection of the fact that these two are correlated through the asymptotic velocity @xmath22 ( see eq .  3 ) .",
    "lines of constant @xmath22 have a slope of @xmath75 in the @xmath76 diagram , and the diagram therefore just reflects the limited range in @xmath77 in the samples .",
    "there is an indication that that @xmath20 increases towards lower surface brightnesses , and that @xmath19 decreases ( as one would expect if lsb galaxies inhabited lower density halos ) .",
    "the large scatter in these figures sheds little light on galaxy formation or the details of pseudo - isothermal halos .",
    "how the observed regularities of galaxy kinematics ( like the tully - fisher relation ) can emerge from this scatter remains a mystery .",
    "a further analysis is presented in @xcite where the mass density distributions that give rise to the observed rotation curves are presented .",
    "they show that the minimum disk mass density distributions at small radii can be parametrized by a power law @xmath78 where for the lsb galaxies @xmath79 , clearly different from @xmath80 as predicted by cdm .",
    "these minimum disk slopes are upper limits . when stars are properly taken into account , assuming some reasonable value for @xmath17 , the slopes decrease , and become even more consistent with constant density cores .",
    "succesfull theories of galaxy formation and evolution that attempt to model lsb galaxies should thus be able to produce halos dominated by constant - density cores .      as noted earlier ,",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath32 halo parameters are related .",
    "here we compare the derived @xmath41 and @xmath32 values with those predicted by @xmath0cdm with the @xcite prescription for @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 with a cobe normalized power spectrum .",
    "the values of @xmath41 depend on the assumed @xmath17 , which , as discussed before , is uncertain .",
    "minimum disk however gives strong upper limits on the values of @xmath41 : when @xmath17 is increased the halo needs to compensate by becoming less concentrated @xcite .",
    "minimum disk models with @xmath41 values higher than found in simulations can usually be reconciled with these observations by increasing @xmath17 or introducing a bulge to bring the @xmath41-values down , as one can see from the progressive decrease in @xmath41 values from minimum disk to maximum disk .",
    "explaining minimum disk models with concentrations lower than the simulated values is more difficult .",
    "it indicates one or more of three problems : failure of the model , failure of the assumption of circular motion in deriving rotation curves , or a dramatic ( non - cosmological ) re - distribution of dm .",
    "this last option is not really understood , and potentially removes any of the predictive power that the cdm theory has .",
    "we will not discuss it here , except to note that the most plausible effect , adiabatic contraction , further concentrates the dm , making the problem worse .",
    "as an aside we note here that the min+gas case sometimes gives slightly higher @xmath41-values than the simple minimum disk case .",
    "in most cases this is due to a central depression in the hi  surface density that gives rises to imaginary rotation velocities , which have to be compensated for by the halo . also some of the outer rotation velocity is explained by the gas rotation curve , yielding a halo curve that bends more at small radii .",
    "consequently the halo model tends to be slightly more concentrated .",
    "[ csumm ] shows the derived @xmath41 and @xmath32 values and compares them with the @xmath0cdm predictions . for the minimum disk case",
    "we show both samples i and ii , for the other three @xmath17 values only sample i is shown .",
    "the data points are coded to indicate their significance level @xmath42 .",
    "several points can be made about fig.[csumm ] .",
    "firstly , the bottom - right plot clearly shows that maximum disk is inconsistent with the nfw halos expected to arise in @xmath0cdm .",
    "secondly , there is some correlation between the significance of the fits and their position in the @xmath84 diagram . in the minimum disk case",
    "the majority ( 11 out of 14 ) of the @xmath43 points are found at @xmath85 km s@xmath8 .",
    "most ( 17 out of 19 ) of the @xmath86 points are found to the right of this line .",
    "this division becomes more clear in the minimum disk+gas and constant @xmath3  plots .",
    "as the high @xmath32 values tend to occur at lower @xmath41 , this is likely to be the effect of a nfw halo trying to fit a solid - body - like curve , by hiding its curvature outside the visible galaxy , i.e. , by decreasing @xmath41 and increasing @xmath32 .",
    "thirdly , the distribution of points does not agree with that predicted by the numerical models @xcite .",
    "there are more points above , but more importantly , below the 1@xmath12 lines than expected .",
    "this low-@xmath41 tail consists of fits that have a high to reasonable significance @xmath42 associated with them .",
    "we show the distribution again in fig .",
    "[ cdist ] .",
    "the two histograms are for minimum disk ( open histogram , samples i and ii ) and constant @xmath3  ( filled histogram , sample i ) .",
    "over - plotted are log - normal distributions showing the distribution derived from numerical simulations .",
    "unfortunately , these simulations do not agree on the value of the dispersion .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model by @xcite gives a logarithmic dispersion @xmath87 , while the distribution for relaxed @xmath0cdm halos as found by @xcite has a logarithmic dispersion of @xmath88 .",
    "the observed distribution is clearly wider than either theoretical one . by changing the cosmology of the model",
    "one can change the mean of the distribution ( e.g.  ocdm has a mean @xmath89 ) @xcite , but the width hardly changes . thus one can possibly shift the model to higher @xmath41 to fit the high-@xmath41 end of the distribution , but it is impossible to explain the large observed low-@xmath41 tail with the kind of log - normal distribution one derives from the simulations .",
    "rotation curves have the implicit assumption of circular motion .",
    "can non - circular motions affect the rotation curves ? as the nfw models show the largest residuals in the centers of some of the lsb galaxies , it is possible that they could be affected by non - circular motions due to non - axisymmetric components .",
    "we will investigate the matter here by comparing the morphology of our galaxies with the quality of the fits .",
    "table  [ morphtable ] contains a short description of the morphology of the galaxies , where we have focussed on the central parts . in the table `` core '' refers to a galaxy whose central light distribution can best be described by an axisymmetric model , presumably implying negligible non - circular motions in the inner part .",
    "the word `` core '' is used very loosely here . it does not necessarily indicate the presence of a bulge or massive central component , but is just an indication of the ( deprojected ) round shape of the isophotes in the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "`` bar '' indicates a central morphology dominated by a bar - like structure , usually magellanic , that may indicate the presence of non - circular motions .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ morphstattable ] ( for the minimum disk assumption ) .",
    "the conclusion is that there is no clear dependence of residual velocity on morphology .",
    "there is thus no indication that the failure of nfw to fit some galaxy rotation curves can be attributed to the presence of bars or non - circular motions .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the inner rotation curves of hsb galaxies can usually be well explained by scaling up the rotation curve derived from the light distribution .",
    "this maximum disk procedure results in @xmath3  values that are reasonably consistent with those derived from stellar population synthesis models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , bars seem to demand near - maximal disks in hsb galaxies @xcite    the matter of maximum disk in lsb galaxies was first discussed by @xcite who noted that from a stellar population point of view maximum disk demanded unreasonably high @xmath17 values . substantial amounts of dm were still needed within the optical disk to explain the observed hi  curves .",
    "smt revisited the subject and noted that the slightly steeper slopes they found using their h@xmath5 curves , enabled them to scale up the disk rotation curve by an even larger factor .",
    "the maximum disk @xmath3value is extremely sensitive to the inner slope , and only a very small increase is needed to change it by a significant factor . in lsb galaxies ,",
    "the maximum disk @xmath3  values are thus much larger than expected on the basis of colors , metallicities and star formation histories .",
    "the higher @xmath3  values as found by smt worsened this problem ( a consequence already noted in @xcite ) , despite the fact that their maximum disk models could slightly better reproduce the observed inner curve .    though it seems unlikely that the maximum disk results can be explained using `` reasonable '' stellar populations , given what we know about the star formation history , dust content and metallicity of lsb galaxies , the matter is still relevant for exploring possible baryonic disk dm scenarios . to explain maximum disk in lsb galaxies purely in terms of baryons one has to assume a large amount of unseen material in the form of e.g.  cold molecular gas , optically thick neutral hydrogen , low mass stars or non - standard initial mass functions .",
    "it should be noted though that many of these hypothetical mass components would however violate constraints imposed by disk stability @xcite , near - infra red colors @xcite , and would possibly introduce a surface brightness segregation in the baryonic tf - relation @xcite    in fig .",
    "[ mlhisto ] we compare the maximum disk @xmath54-band @xmath3ratios - band values using the @xmath90 color .",
    "we converted our data to @xmath54-band , rather than converting the hsb data to @xmath14-band , as the colors of lsb galaxies are better determined than those of the broeils hsb galaxies .",
    "the color gradients in lsb galaxies are small , so systematic effects are negligible . ] for sample i , with those derived by @xcite for a sample of mostly hsb galaxies and by @xcite for a sample of dwarfs .",
    "we again show only bulge - less galaxies brighter than @xmath91",
    ". also indicated are @xmath3  values from @xcite , who tabulate stellar mass - to - light ratios for various star formation histories and population synthesis models as a function of color . here",
    "we show representative values ( assuming a simple salpeter imf ) spanning the color range exhibited by late - type hsb galaxies , gas - rich dwarfs and lsb galaxies .",
    "the @xmath3  values for hsb galaxies agree to within a factor of 3 and can be considered to be ( close to ) maximum disk .",
    "the values found for lsb galaxies and dwarfs are less easily reconciled with the model values .",
    "observationally values up to @xmath92 are found , while the typical model value ( again for a simple salpeter imf ) is @xmath93 for @xmath94 ( the average color for a dwarf / lsb ) .",
    "this discrepancy can not be explained with extinction or population effects .",
    "extinction in dwarfs and lsb galaxies is less than in hsb galaxies @xcite , and a factor of @xmath95 ( 3.0 mag ) extinction is hard to reconcile with the known properties of lsb galaxies .",
    "line - of - sight extinctions observed towards hii regions in lsb galaxies are never as large @xcite .",
    "apart from changing the imf in an _ ad hoc _ way it is hard to see how such high @xmath3  values can be reached given the constraints imposed by what we know about the star formation history ( low sfr in past and at present ) and the blue ( optical and nir ) colors of lsb galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the maximum disk values as found in lsb galaxies are not representative of the evolutionary stage of these galaxies .",
    "while the maximum disk prescription now has somewhat greater success in predicting the inner shape of the rotation curves of lsb galaxies , it requires stellar mass - to - light ratios which are too large for the stellar populations in these galaxies .",
    "the mass discrepancies are still large ; all this does is move the dm from halo to disk .      just as the minimum disk assumption gives us an upper limit on the amount of dm implied by rotation curves , the maximum disk hypothesis gives us an upper limit on the amount of mass that could potentially be hidden in a disk .",
    "it is therefore still useful to ask ourselves what these maximum disk upper limits imply for the stellar disks .",
    "maximum disk means maximum surface density ( luminous surface density times @xmath3 ) , and therefore gives an absolute upper limit on the mass surface density in stellar disks ( for mass components that are distributed like the stars ) .",
    "figure  [ maxdisk ] summarizes the maximum disk results for the sample i lsb galaxies as well as the @xcite and @xcite hsb and dwarf samples .",
    "we plot the maximum disk @xmath3  values , as well as the luminosity , rotation velocity , surface brightness , and maximum disk surface density .",
    "the data are divided into three surface brightness bins .",
    "as already shown in @xcite , at fixed @xmath77 lsb galaxies have higher maximum @xmath3  values than hsb galaxies .",
    "figure  [ maxdisk ] also shows the maximum surface density @xmath12 . as",
    "the decrease in surface brightness is faster than the increase in maximum disk @xmath17 , towards low surface brightnesses the maximum surface density @xmath12 in a disk decreases with surface brightness .",
    "the @xmath96 panel suggests that there is a well - defined upper limit to the maximum surface density disks can attain . even under maximum disk ,",
    "lsb galaxy disks have on average lower surface densities than hsb galaxy disks , again putting limits on the amount of baryonic mass one can hide in these disk .",
    "figure  [ nfwiso ] shows that even in the maximum disk case most lsb galaxies have @xmath77(disk ) @xmath97(observed ) .",
    "therefore , even in the maximum disk case a moderate amount of dm is still required in the optical disk .",
    "it is therefore hard to explain the tf relation for lsb galaxies in the context of maximum disk : the stellar disk then needs to provide the luminosity , _ and _ the necessary rotation velocity .",
    "lsb galaxies would deviate systematically from the hsb tf relation , which is evidently not the case @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in the inset panel in fig .",
    "[ maxdisk ] ( lower - right ) . using the arguments in @xcite we find that @xmath98 needs to be constant for galaxies to obey a tf relation independent of surface brightness .",
    "if all galaxies were truly maximum disk ( in the sense that @xmath77(disk ) @xmath99(observed ) , one could replace this by the requirement that @xmath100 needs to be constant .",
    "the lower - right panel shows that this is not the case : at fixed @xmath77 there is a substantial scatter which would translate in @xmath101 mag scatter in tf .",
    "clearly the observed scatter is much smaller , and this shows the clear need for an additional mass component to make tf work . in other words , maximum disk for _ all _ galaxies and tf are incompatible .",
    "the most important conclusion from this work is that the large majority of the high - resolution rotation curves presented here prefer the pseudo - isothermal core - dominated halo model . for a small number of galaxies neither the pseudo - isothermal nor the nfw models are an adequate description of the data",
    "this should not come as a surprise as the true dm distribution is likely to be more complex than the models presented here .",
    "nevertheless , the general trend is that for almost all galaxies discussed here the relative quality of the fits using the pseudo - isothermal model is better than those for the nfw model .    for a small numer of galaxies",
    "the nfw model provides a good fit , but generally the concentrations derived from the observed rotation curves are lower than predicted by the simulations .",
    "this is hard to fix : the most likely effect which may alter the initial cosmological nfw halo is adiabatic contraction , but this has the effect of making the final ( observed ) halo _ more _ concentrated , so one would have to start off with ( cosmologically relevant ) halos that are even _ less _ concentrated .",
    "it is worrying that for one or two extreme cases the difference between `` cdm does work '' or `` cdm does nt work '' depends on subtle differences in data , data handling , or analysis .",
    "figure  [ nfwswaters ] illustrates that opposite claims can sometimes be made from the same data .",
    "hence we re - iterate the need for the highest quality data of a large sample , in order to minimize these effects .",
    "we refer to @xcite where it is shown that _ all _ data presented here are consistent with a core - dominated model ; the good nfw fits that are found for a number of lsb galaxies can be attributed to resolution effects .",
    "* pseudo - isothermal halos are a better description of the data than nfw halos . *",
    "the number of galaxies that can not be fit with nfw halos is significantly larger than the number of galaxies that can not be fitted with the pseudo - isothermal model . *",
    "the quality of the fit is not obviously related to morphology , luminosity , or surface brightness . *",
    "a larger number of low-@xmath41 nfw halos is found than one would expect based on the distribution derived from cdm simulations . *",
    "if one were to construct models that would have the correct @xmath41-@xmath32 values as predicted by cosmology , then the resulting @xmath3  values would be too low to be consistent with stellar population numbers .",
    "the shape of the curves would still be wrong .",
    "* the maximum disk prescription works to predict the inner rotation curve shape to some extent , but gives mass - to - light ratios which are too high to be accounted for by stellar population synthesis models .",
    "* applying the maximum disk values yields absolute upper limits on the disk mass surface density that is strongly correlated with surface brightness .",
