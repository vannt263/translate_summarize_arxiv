    "although there is a consensus that cosmic rays with energies less than the knee energy at @xmath0 ev are accelerated by supernova remnant shocks , the origin of higher energy cosmic rays is unknown .",

    "the maximum particle energy is derived for the extremes of quasi - parallel ( q-@xmath2 ) and quasi - perpendicular ( q-@xmath3 ) shocks @xcite .",
    "we find that the maximum particle energy is not greatly increased in the latter case due to a geometric constraint that applies in cases where a large scale toroidal magnetic field is absent . in  3 , we consider the highest energy that particles can be accelerated by shock fermi processes at a relativistic external shock , following @xcite . in ",
    "4 we show that the highest energies that can be reached by fermi processes in supernova or grb - type explosions result from second - order gyroresonant stochastic acceleration in the shocked fluid of a relativistic blast wave @xcite .",
    "this maximum particle energy @xmath4 can exceed @xmath5 ev in grb blast waves for reasonable parameter values .",
    "cosmic rays with energies above the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum is proposed to originate from second - order fermi acceleration at relativistic shocks (  5 ) .",
    "we treat first - order fermi acceleration of relativistic nonthermal particles with @xmath6 .",
    "our notation is that @xmath7 is the flow speed , and the blast - wave evolution is described by momentum @xmath8 .",
