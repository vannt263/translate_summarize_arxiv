    "the interaction with surface acoustic waves ( saw ) is an important tool in the study of two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) in various regimes  @xcite , in particular , under conditions of the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "as well known , the two - dimensional electron system exhibits a metallic phase in strong magnetic fields , near the half filled landau level , @xmath2 .",
    "this phase has been understood as a gas of so - called _ composite fermions _ ( cfs ) .",
    "this concept formulated in the framework of a chern - simons theory  @xcite has appeared successful to explain the acoustic properties of 2deg  @xcite and to extract quantitative information about cfs trajectories .",
    "so far , both experimental and theoretical studies have concentrated on the linear response regime , which is valid for low sound intensities . on the other hand , a very peculiar _ nonlinear _ response of 3deg to acoustic waves ( aw )",
    "has been predicted  @xcite and experimentally observed in  @xcite and in  @xcite .",
    "a striking feature of this nonlinear response is its _ anomalous sensitivity _ to an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "in fact , nonlinear response appears suppressed by so weak magnetic field which does not effect linear absorption at all  @xcite .",
    "the theory of nonlinear response in external magnetic field has been elaborated in  @xcite , a comprehensive review is given in  @xcite .",
    "what is important is that an external magnetic field provides an _ intrinsic scale _ to measure the force acting upon electrons from the aw .",
    "it is therefore natural to investigate whether the nonlinear effects observed for electrons are also present in the two dimensional cf liquid , and what new information they provide .",
    "this is the aim of the present paper .",
    "to begin with , let us recall the qualitative picture of nonlinear acoustic response of 3deg .",
    "if wave vector @xmath3 is much greater than the electron mean free path @xmath4 , then an electron traverses many acoustic periods before being scattered .",
    "consequently , it contributes to the absorption as a free particle .",
    "since for typical electron the @xmath3-projection of the electron velocity @xmath5 , @xmath6 , is much greater than the sound velocity , @xmath7 , it `` feels '' a rapidly oscillating field of the acoustic wave , the contribution to the absorption being small . as result , only a small electron group with @xmath8 appears important .",
    "these _ resonant _ electrons determine linear absorption .",
    "the situation is very similar to the well known _",
    "landau damping _ of plasma waves  @xcite . turning to",
    "the _ nonlinear _ effects one has to discuss dynamics of the resonant electrons in the finite - amplitude field produced by the aw . as a result ,",
    "a part of resonant electrons with small @xmath9 become trapped by the acoustic field .",
    "moving fully synchronously with the aw , the trapped electrons do not contribute to the absorption , the total absorption being decreased .",
    "this is is the reason for the nonlinear behavior of the absorption in the absence of the external magnetic field .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "now let us turn to the linear absorption in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the most interesting behavior takes place at @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the classical cyclotron radius while @xmath12 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the the electron orbit embeds many acoustic wave lengths , as it is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "again , only vicinities of the turning points 1 and 2 are important because only in these regions @xmath13 can be of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "correlation of acoustic phases at the turning points lead to well known _ geometric oscillations",
    "_  @xcite . for composite fermions geometric oscillations",
    "have also been clearly observed  @xcite .    to preserve the picture of nonlinear absorption discussed above , the force component along @xmath3 , @xmath14 , should be much less than the typical force from the acoustic wave , @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the amplitude of the aw - induced potential profile .",
    "otherwise some electrons appear _ de - trapped _ , and the absorption returns to the linear one .",
    "the situation near a turning point in this case is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . comparing the forces we arrive at the estimate for the critical magnetic field , @xmath17",
    ". measuring @xmath18 one immediately finds the force @xmath19 near the turning points . to reproduce the",
    "above discussed scheme for cfs is the main idea behind this work .",
    "now let us turn to the case of interests , namely to 2deg interacting with saw .",
    "in many experimental situations one can neglect the deformational interaction due to strains created by saw in the plane of 2deg , and the force experienced by the electrons is purely electromagnetic .",
    "it is created by the external magnetic field and by the ac electric field of the surface acoustic wave .",
    "the latter arises because of piezoelectric effect in the materials used to create the 2deg ( gaas - algaas heterostructures ) .",
    "the `` bare '' piezoelectric field is parallel to the propagation direction , @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the unit vector along @xmath3-direction .",
    "the effective electric field is then given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the saw frequency , and @xmath25 is the wave coordinate ; @xmath26 .",
    "by @xmath27 we mean the screened electrostatic potential . the relationship between this and the bare potential is discussed in ref .",
    "the cf - picture arises after the chern - simons transformation which attaches an even number of flux quanta of a fictitious magnetic field to each electron .",
    "the resulting particles are called the _",
    "composite fermions_. for definiteness we will consider the case of two attached flux quanta , appropriate for the state around @xmath2 . at the mean field level , the composite fermions will then feel an effective magnetic field @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the external ( real ) magnetic field and @xmath30 is the chern - simons field . here @xmath31 is the magnetic flux quantum and @xmath32 is the electron density which includes the density modulation by saw , @xmath33 .",
    "correspondingly there will be a modulation of the chern - simons field , @xmath34 .",
    "we will let @xmath35 represent the average effective field , so that the total magnetic field acting on the composite fermions is @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , the motion of the cfs will create an ac electric chern - simons field which is given by @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath38-component of @xmath39 is given by the @xmath40-component of the current .",
    "we can find this from the density modulation using charge conservation . assuming that the density modulation is @xmath41",
    ", we get @xmath42 .",
    "we will later see that this assumption is justified .",
    "we then have @xmath43 .",
    "this is true under the assumption of a harmonic density perturbation and as long as there is no net current through the sample .",
    "the @xmath40-component of the cs electric field can , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be considered as a potential field .",
    "the corresponding potential will be denoted @xmath44 , and in the following we will calculate the response to this field .",
    "however , it can be shown ( see below ) that in the regime of strong nonlinearity the cs electric field is not important at all .",
    "below we employ the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . to calculate the nonlinear absorption by cfs we employ the boltzmann equation for the cf distribution function , @xmath45 , considering cfs as particles with charge @xmath46 and mass @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , the classical hamiltonian is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the canonical momentum ( the kinematic momentum is @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 is the vector potential while @xmath44 is the total scalar potential as explained above .",
    "the vector potential consists of two parts .",
    "one emerges from the static external effective magnetic field @xmath52 , and one from the ac chern - simons field that is created by the saw - induced density modulation . at @xmath2 , @xmath53 , and the magnetic field",
    "is then @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "it is convenient to split the distribution function as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the fermi function .",
    "then the boltzmann equation for @xmath57 is @xmath58 here we use the relaxation time approximation @xmath59 for the collision operator which significantly simplifies the calculations .",
    "as is emphasized in  @xcite , this leads to charge non - conservation .",
    "however , this is not expected to give any qualitative change at @xmath60 ( see , e.  g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) is written in terms of the ac chern - simons magnetic field @xmath61 .",
    "the latter must be expressed through the density modulation as an integral over the distribution function .",
    "the boltzmann equation ( [ boltzmann ] ) is then in reality a complicated integro - differential equation for the non - equilibrium distribution function .",
    "it is easy to show , however , that the main contribution to the density modulation comes from the equilibrium part @xmath62 , so that in calculating @xmath57 we can approximate the density modulation with @xmath63 coming from @xmath62 .",
    "indeed , using the fact that in all the region of acoustic amplitudes @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the fermi energy , we can then expand @xmath62 around the point @xmath66 .",
    "the lowest - order term , @xmath63 , is estimated as @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the density of states per spin ( as usual , we assume the 2deg to be fully spin - polarized )",
    ". then we can solve eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) for @xmath57 with the assumption that @xmath69 , and come back to show that the non - equilibrium correction coming from @xmath57 is small compared to @xmath63 .",
    "we will first consider the case @xmath53 .",
    "proceeding to the solution , we note that in the resonant region @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the magnetic force then points mainly in the @xmath40-direction , and the main part of this will be given by @xmath72 .",
    "this may be combined with the potential @xmath44 to give the effective potential @xmath73 such that @xmath74 , the sign being @xmath75 for particles with @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 . using the approximation @xmath79 and assuming the electric potential to have the form @xmath80 we can find the explicit expression for @xmath73 , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 the equation for @xmath57",
    "can then be written as @xmath83 with @xmath84 the dimensionless parameter @xmath85 has a clear physical meaning .",
    "indeed , @xmath86 is just a typical velocity of the particles trapped in the potential @xmath87 , while @xmath88 is their typical oscillation frequency .",
    "since each scattering event rotates the particle momentum and leads to its escape from the resonant group , nonlinear behavior exists only if @xmath89 , or @xmath90 thus @xmath85 is the main parameter responsible for nonlinear behavior .",
    "equation ( [ resbolt ] ) is easily solved by the method of characteristics , giving the equations @xmath91 solving first the equation for @xmath92 and @xmath93 we obtain @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a constant of integration .",
    "it has the meaning of a dimensionless energy for the motion in the @xmath40-direction .",
    "the remaining equation for @xmath57 and @xmath93 is then @xmath96 the sign is @xmath75 for particles with @xmath97 and @xmath77 for particles with @xmath98 .",
    "equation ( [ resbolt1 ] ) requires boundary conditions . for the untrapped particles , we use periodic boundary conditions , while for the trapped ones we require @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the turning points to the left and right of @xmath93 respectively .",
    "the result is @xmath102^{-1 }    \\int_{\\xi}^{\\xi+2\\pi}\\upd \\xi'\\frac{\\psi'(\\xi')}{s(\\xi ' ) }    e^{a\\int_{\\xi}^{\\xi'}\\frac{\\upd \\xi''}{s(\\xi'')}}\\ , ; \\label{ut}\\\\   \\bar{f}_{1,t}^+(\\xi ) & = &   \\left[\\sinh\\left\\{a\\int_{\\xi_1}^{\\xi_2}\\frac{\\upd \\xi '' }    { s(\\xi '' ) } \\right\\}\\right]^{-1 }     \\int_{\\xi_1}^{\\xi_2}\\upd \\xi'\\frac{\\psi'(\\xi')}{s(\\xi ' ) }       \\cosh\\left\\{a\\int_{\\xi_1}^{\\xi'}\\frac{\\upd \\xi''}{s(\\xi'')}\\right\\ }    e^{a\\int_{\\xi}^{\\xi_2}\\frac{\\upd \\xi''}{s(\\xi '' ) } } \\nonumber \\\\    & & - \\int_{\\xi}^{\\xi_2}\\upd \\xi'\\frac{\\psi'(\\xi')}{s(\\xi ' ) }    e^{a\\int_{\\xi}^{\\xi'}\\frac{\\upd \\xi''}{s(\\xi '' ) } } , \\label{t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath103 the expression for @xmath104 can be obtained by changing the sign of @xmath92 .",
    "it is easy to check explicitly , that as @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "consequently , only resonant particles are important .    in the following",
    "we will consider the limiting case of strong nonlinearity @xmath107 . in this limit",
    "we can expand the distribution functions ( [ ut ] ) and ( [ t ] ) in powers of @xmath85 and then compute the non - equilibrium density modulation @xmath108 . as a result , @xmath109 which is small ( @xmath110 is of order @xmath111 in typical experiments .",
    "the approximation could break down if @xmath112 was very large ) .",
    "similarly , we may calculate the current in the @xmath38-direction due to @xmath57 in order to determine the @xmath40-component of the cs electric field .",
    "again , this contribution appears proportional to @xmath85 and small .",
    "this means that any higher harmonics in the cs electric field will be suppressed by a factor @xmath85 .",
    "we are now able to calculate the absorbed power per length of cross section , @xmath113 , from the acoustic wave .",
    "it is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes average over the period of the acoustic wave , while @xmath116 when evaluating @xmath117 one must include contributions from both trapped and untrapped particles in all directions ( i. e. for both signs @xmath118 ) , and adjust the range of @xmath119 accordingly",
    ". the contributions from particles with different sign of @xmath92 will cancel in the order @xmath120 terms , and the leading contribution will be to order @xmath85 .",
    "after rather tedious calculations we arrive at the result , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is some numerical factor that is found from numerical integration .",
    "let us now turn to the case where the effective external magnetic field , @xmath52 , is not exactly zero , that is , where the filling fraction @xmath0 is close to but not equal to @xmath123 . in the resonant region , the hamiltonian ( [ resham ] )",
    "is then changed to @xmath124 here and in the following we write the expressions for particles with @xmath76 , for @xmath78 the sign of the last term must be changed .",
    "we still write @xmath125 , but the force acquires a new contribution @xmath126 . the boltzmann equation ( [ resbolt ] )",
    "is then transformed to the form @xmath127(\\partial   f_1/\\partial s)+af_1=au , \\qquad b = v_fb^*/q\\pi_0\\ , .\\ ] ] the physical interpretation of the parameter @xmath128 is the ratio of the magnetic force from the external magnetic field to the force from the modified electrostatic potential @xmath87 . solving the equations for the characteristics we get instead of eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) , @xmath129 here we write @xmath93 for @xmath130 , i. e. we translate the origin of the coordinates to adjust to the modified potential . in the case",
    "@xmath131 , in which we are most interested , there will be only one turning point , which we will denote @xmath132 , and all particles will be untrapped .",
    "this will then be the only point where @xmath133 , and we get @xmath134 .",
    "the particles will then come from @xmath135 at @xmath136 , turn at @xmath132 and return to @xmath135 at @xmath137 .",
    "of course this is not the true trajectory of the particles , but it approximates the true trajectory close to the turning point . the nonequilibrium distribution function is @xmath138 here the integral over @xmath93 is to be taken along the trajectory defined by the constant @xmath119 .",
    "that is , for particles that have passed their turning point ( and thus have @xmath98 ) we must integrate up to @xmath132 and then back to @xmath93 remembering the change of sign of @xmath92 . when @xmath139 and @xmath131 the argument of the exponential is very close to 0 in the region of effective interaction near the turning point .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we will therefore set the exponential to 1 in this region .",
    "changing variable from the integration constant @xmath119 to the position of the turning point , @xmath132 , and expanding @xmath140 in powers of @xmath141 to lowest order we obtain for the total absorption @xmath142 this is equal to the _ linear absorption _ , @xmath143 , in the absence of an external magnetic field , which can be directly calculated from the linearized boltzmann equation .",
    "indeed , magnetic field restores linear absorption .",
    "the possibility to restore linear absorption at @xmath144 allows one to determine directly the @xmath3-component of the force , @xmath145 , acting upon cf at the turning points .",
    "since the effective force is a complicated function of saw intensity and frequency ( a detailed theoretical study of this force will be published elsewhere ) , the relationship ( [ bstar ] ) seems useful . on the other hand , the product @xmath146 can be directly determined from eq .",
    "( [ abssb ] ) knowing the _ measured _ absorbed power , @xmath113 .",
    "consequently , a way to check the above concept is first to reach nonlinear behavior at @xmath147 , then restore the linear behavior by changing magnetic field by the quantity @xmath148 , and finally measure the absorbed power without changing saw intensity .",
    "it is shown that absorption of saw by 2deg will show a pronounced nonlinear behavior at @xmath2 .",
    "small deviations from @xmath149 will restore linear absorption .",
    "studies of these deviations allow one to determine the effective force acting upon composite fermions .",
