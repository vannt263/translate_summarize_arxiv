    "the classical xy model has been widely used for decades as a model for phase transitions in materials with interacting spins .",

    "the @xmath14 xy model undergoes the well - known kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition @xcite , characterized by an unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs at the kt transition temperature @xmath15 .",
    "the kt transition is a continuous phase transition , but with unique critical properties @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 xy model exhibits a more conventional phase transition with well - known critical exponents @xcite .",
    "it is thought to describe many ferromagnetic materials with two - component spins .",
    "in addition , it describes phase transitions in which the `` spins '' actually represent the phases of a complex order parameter , such as the @xmath17 transition in he@xmath18 and superconductor - to - normal phase transition at zero applied magnetic field .",
    "the _ frustrated _ classical xy model , in either @xmath14 or @xmath16 , has a much wider range of phase diagrams than does the unfrustrated case just mentioned . in this model ,",
    "the coupling between spins is such that the ground state of the system can not minimize all the bond energies simultaneously .",
    "interest in this model was greatly increased when it was realized that this model described real systems , such as josephson junction arrays in an applied magnetic field .",
    "the first demonstration that the fully frustrated xy model undergoes a continuous phase transition in @xmath19 was given by teitel and jayaprakash @xcite , using monte carlo ( mc ) techniques .",
    "this work was later extended to other values of the so - called frustration parameter @xmath20 @xcite , leading to an extensive literature on two - dimensional ( 2d ) frustrated xy model on various lattices and at different values of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 frustrated xy model has also been studied extensively , in part because it is believed to describe flux line lattice ( fll ) melting @xcite under an applied magnetic field in high - t@xmath21 superconductors .",
    "@xcite used a uniformly frustrated 3d xy model on a stacked triangular lattice to study the melting of an unpinned abrikosov lattice in a type - ii superconductor .",
    "they showed convincingly that this melting transition is first order , rather than continuous  a prediction subsequently confirmed by experiment .",
    "earlier work on a frustrated xy model on a simple cubic lattice , with magnetic field parallel to one of the lattice axes @xcite found a continuous phase transition .",
    "li and teitel @xcite used a uniformly frustrated xy model similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the properties of the vortex line liquid which appears above the melting temperature , and to investigate the possibility of a further phase transition between an entangled and a disentangled vortex line liquid above the fll melting transition .",
    "chen and teitel @xcite later extended this work to the more realistic case of uniaxially anisotropic couplings ; they suggested that there was another phase transition temperature @xmath22 above the fll melting temperature @xmath23 , where superconducting coherence parallel to the applied magnetic field would vanish .",
    "_ @xcite have , however , suggested that this apparent existence of a transition to a disentangled vortex liquid is a result of finite system sizes and simulation times .",
    "more recently , the uniformly frustrated 3d xy model was studied by monte carlo methods on a simple cubic lattice with a magnetic field parallel to the @xmath24 $ ] direction @xcite . for this choice of field direction",
    ", the simple cubic lattice behaves as a stack of 2d triangular lattices with @xmath25 stacking .",
    "it was found that this system , similar to that studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , exhibits a clear first - order fll melting transition .",
    "nguyen and sudb  @xcite considered a uniformly frustrated anisotropic villain model ( an approximation to the uniformly frustrated xy model ) to study the phase diagram of a uniaxially anisotropic high - t@xmath21 superconductor as a function of the applied magnetic field and temperature .",
    "they found two phase transitions : the lower - temperature one is fll melting , while that at higher temperature involves the destruction of the phase coherence in the direction of the applied magnetic field .    in this paper , we study phase transitions in the fully frustrated xy model in @xmath16 , using primarily mc simulations .",
    "this model is of interest , in part , because it may be relevant to fll melting in the high - t@xmath21 materials .",
    "in addition , because of great advances in microfabrication techniques , it is now possible to make microscale or nanoscale arrays of josephson superconducting grains _ in three dimensions_. such an array should , in a suitable applied magnetic field , be describable by a frustrated xy model , at least to a first approximation .",
    "it has also recently been suggested that a fully frustrated xy model might also be realized by an assembly of cold atoms on a suitably constructed optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the fully frustrated xy model is characterized by the frustration vector @xmath26 , as further defined below .",
    "such a model has been previously studied by diep _",
    "@xcite , who found that , in contrast to the @xmath27 case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , there was a continuous phase transition .",
    "we extend the work of ref .",
    "@xcite by calculating the critical behavior of the helicity modulus , equivalent to the spin - wave stiffness constant ( or to the superfluid density in a superconductor ) .",
    "we also carry out a more extensive finite - size scaling analysis than done by those workers , thus obtaining more accurate information about the critical behavior .",
    "our results do , however , confirm that the phase transition is continuous , not first order .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "sec : level3 ] , we give the results of our monte carlo calculations , finite - size scaling methods , and renormalization group methods .",
    "section [ sec : level4 ] presents a summary and discussions .",
    "we now describe the model hamiltonian on which our calculations are carried out . for convenience ,",
    "we present this hamiltonian as it applies to a simple cubic lattice of superconducting grains in the presence of an applied external magnetic field @xmath28 , though the model is not limited to this application , of course .",
    "then the frustrated xy model in @xmath16 is described by the hamiltonian @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the phase of the superconducting order parameter on the @xmath31th site , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the flux quantum , @xmath34 is the vector potential , @xmath35 is the coupling constant between the @xmath31th site and @xmath36th site , and @xmath37 represents a sum over all distinct pairs of nearest - neighbor sites on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "we assume a constant coupling between each nearest - neighbor pair of sites , so @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; we neglect the possible dependence of @xmath2 on the applied magnetic field @xmath28 and the temperature @xmath40 .",
    "we also assume weak screening as in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , the local magnetic field @xmath41 is approximated by the applied magnetic field @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath42 component of the frustration vector @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 where the sum is taken along the sides of a plaquette on the @xmath45 plane of the lattice ; analogous definitions hold for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "if the simple cubic lattice has lattice constant @xmath48 , @xmath49 represents the flux through a single plaquette perpendicular to the @xmath31th axis , in units of one flux quantum .",
    "one can also define the vortex number ( or _ vorticity _ ) of each square plaquette .",
    "for example , the vorticity of a plaquette lying in the @xmath45 plane is defined by @xmath50 where the sum runs counterclockwise around the perimeter of the plaquette , viewed from the positive @xmath42 direction , and the phase differences are chosen so that @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are defined analogously .    in order to study possible phase transitions within this model",
    ", we have calculated several quantities .",
    "one of these is the specific heat @xmath54 per site , given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the total number of sites in the lattice , @xmath57 is the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil ] ) , and @xmath58 denotes an average within the canonical ensemble .",
    "a first - order phase transition is generally indicated by a @xmath59-function - like anomaly in @xmath54 , while a continuous phase transition is signaled by lattice - size - dependent divergence in the @xmath54 .    to study the vortex lattice melting , we calculate a suitable vorticity density - density correlation function .",
    "specifically , we first introduce the fourier transform of the vorticity density @xmath60 , where @xmath61 represents the vorticity of a plaquette centered at @xmath62 and oriented perpendicular to the @xmath31th axis .",
    "we then calculate some of the correlation functions @xmath63 where the sum is carried out over all @xmath62 and @xmath64 such that @xmath65 . in our actual simulations , we use periodic boundary conditions in all three directions . in practice",
    ", it is more convenient to compute the fourier transform of @xmath66 .",
    "this fourier transform is known as the vortex structure factor , and is given by @xmath67 . because of the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath68 is defined only for @xmath69(m_1 , m_2 , m_3)$ ] , where @xmath70 are integers , and the computational cell is assumed to contain @xmath71 sites .",
    "we obtain @xmath66 by first computing @xmath68 and then fourier - transforming back into real space .",
    "the phase transition in this model is best characterized by the _ helicity modulus tensor _",
    "@xmath72 @xcite .",
    "@xmath73 measures the stiffness of the phase @xmath74 against an external twist .",
    "it is defined as the second derivative of the free energy with respect to an infinitesimal phase twist @xcite @xmath75 @xmath73 is conveniently calculated by adding a fictitious vector potential @xmath76 to the hamiltonian in eq.([eq : hamil ] ) , as @xmath77 in the presence of periodic boundary conditions on the phases .",
    "the resulting diagonal components are readily evaluated , with the result @xmath78^{2}\\right\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{nk_{b}t}\\left\\langle \\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle}j_{ij } \\sin ( \\phi_{i}-\\phi_{j}-a_{ij})(\\mbox{\\^{e}}_{ij}\\cdot \\mbox{\\^{e}}_{\\alpha})\\right\\rangle^{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath79 is the unit vector from the @xmath31th site to the @xmath36th site , and @xmath80 is the unit vector in the @xmath6 direction . since the helicity modulus @xmath81 is proportional to the @xmath6 component of the superfluid density , it follows that when @xmath82 , there is nonzero phase coherence in the @xmath6 direction , and when @xmath83 , the phase coherence is lost",
    ". therefore , the superconductor - to - normal phase transition occurs at the temperature at which @xmath83 .",
    "the correlation time @xmath84 is a measure of how long it takes for the system to lose its memory of its previous state .",
    "@xmath84 can be obtained by calculating a time - displaced autocorrelation function @xcite .",
    "the time - displaced autocorrelation function @xmath85 of the energy , for example , is defined by @xmath86[e(t^\\prime+t)-\\langle e \\rangle]\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int[e(t^\\prime)e(t^\\prime+t)-\\langle e \\rangle^2]\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime , \\label{eq : auto}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are two different monte carlo `` times . ''",
    "since monte carlo simulations involve fictitious dynamics , these times are not related in any obvious way to a physical time .",
    "however , the length of the monte carlo time does give a measure of the persistence of various mc states in time .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : auto ] ) can be expressed more conveniently when we have a set of measurements of the energy @xmath89 from @xmath90 ( after equilibration ) up to some maximum time @xmath91 . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : auto ] ) becomes @xmath92 since the autocorrelation function is expected to fall off exponentially at long times as @xmath93 the correlation time @xmath84 can be calculated from @xmath94 this expression for @xmath84 is also called _ integrated correlation time_. mc `` measurements '' will be statistically independent only if they are separated by intervals of @xmath95 or more .",
    "in addition , the correlation time @xmath84 is related to the dynamic exponent @xmath96 by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the _ correlation length _",
    "( equal to @xmath99 at the @xmath100 ) .",
    "the dynamic exponent measures the extent of the critical slowing down .",
    "the smaller @xmath96 is , the more accurate are the numerical measurements .",
    "if there is a continuous phase transition , various quantities should exhibit singular behavior near the transition temperature @xmath101 .",
    "if we define a reduced temperature by @xmath102 then in the thermodynamic limit the correlation length @xmath98 , the specific heat per site @xmath103 , and the helicity modulus @xmath104 near @xmath101 are expected to vary as @xmath105 where @xmath8 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are critical exponents .",
    "if @xmath101 is known , the simulation data can be fitted to the expected asymptotic form to obtain values of the critical exponents .",
    "but since @xmath101 is typically not known in advance , it is usually more accurate to use a different method .",
    "one such method is finite - size scaling , which extracts values for the critical exponents by investigating how measurements depend on the size @xmath99 of the system @xcite .",
    "this procedure is carried out by expressing a quantity of interest in terms of the correlation length and then introducing a new dimensionless function , known as a _ scaling function_. for example , @xmath54 and @xmath104 are expressed as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the linear system dimension . since the scaling functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 should depend on a single variable , we can make all the data for each system size @xmath99 fall on the same curve by appropriately adjusting the values of the critical exponents and @xmath101 .",
    "when this happens , we assume that we have the correct values for these quantities .",
    "another method is the phenomenological renormalization group ( prg ) @xcite . to calculate the critical behavior of @xmath104 , for example , we consider two different system sizes @xmath99 and @xmath110 and introduce the ratio @xmath111 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammasf ] ) this ratio becomes @xmath112 when @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , if one plots two different curves of @xmath114 versus @xmath87 with the same ratio of @xmath115 , the temperature at which they intersect is @xmath101 , and the value of @xmath116 at that temperature yields the ratio @xmath117 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath118 , or its inverse value @xmath119 , and the critical exponent @xmath8 can also be determined from binder s fourth - order cumulant @xmath120 @xcite defined by @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "the scaling form for the binder s cumulant is @xmath123 , without any prefactor .",
    "hence , @xmath124 can be taylor expanded about @xmath118 as @xmath125 if we plot @xmath120 for several values of @xmath99 as a function of temperature or its inverse value , they will intersect at the critical temperature @xmath101 . to obtain the exponent @xmath8 , we can calculate @xmath126 , where @xmath127 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor ] ) , we find that @xmath128 hence , the ratio of the two slopes for different values of @xmath99 gives @xmath8 .",
    "to carry out our monte carlo calculations , we used the standard metropolis algorithm with periodic boundary conditions in all three directions .",
    "we started with a random phase configuration at temperature @xmath129 , then cooled down to @xmath130 in steps of @xmath131 , except near @xmath101 , where we decreased the temperature in steps of @xmath132 . at each @xmath40",
    ", we took 50000 monte carlo steps per site through the entire lattice for equilibration , and then calculated the expectation values of the quantities of interest by averaging over an additional 20000 mc steps .",
    "we also used the final configuration of the previous @xmath40 as the starting one of the current @xmath40 .",
    "near @xmath101 , the system undergoes critical slowing down ; so we increased the number of mc steps up to @xmath133 for equilibration and @xmath134 for averaging .    instead of considering continuous angles between @xmath135 and @xmath136 for the phases @xmath137 of the order parameter on each site",
    ", we used the 360-state clock model , which allows angles of @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , ... , @xmath141 .",
    "this simplification should have no effect on our results , since it is known that there is no distinction between the continuum and the discrete results for the @xmath9-state clock model when @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "to calculate the phase factors @xmath143 , we use the gauge @xmath144 , where the frustration is @xmath145 .",
    "thus , for example , the phase factors @xmath146 arising from the field component parallel to @xmath96 all vanish except for bonds in the @xmath147 direction ; for these bonds , and @xmath148 , @xmath146 is given by @xmath149 the phase factors @xmath150 and @xmath151 are given by analogous expressions .",
    "for @xmath26 and periodic boundary conditions in all three directions , all the phase factors are equal to either @xmath135 or @xmath152 , and thus all the couplings are of the form @xmath153 .",
    "this choice of gauge automatically satisfies the condition given in eq .",

    "@xcite . as in those two examples ,",
    "the finite magnitude of @xmath54 at its peak is a result of the finite system size ; otherwise , @xmath54 would diverge at @xmath101 in the infinite system .",

    "the plot for the rescaled data has considerable uncertainty in the slope ; so @xmath8 can not be determined with great accuracy using this method , at least using simulations of the size we have carried out here .",
    "all of our numerical data appears to be consistent with a single phase transition at @xmath174 .",
    "by contrast , there are two separate phase transitions in two - dimensional fully frustrated xy model on a square or triangular lattice , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of these is a kt transition while the other is in the ising universality class .",
    "although the two transition temperatures are close to each other , the ising transition temperature is slightly higher than that of the kt transition .",
    "reference  @xcite explains the sequence of these phase transitions in terms of the loss of phase coupling across a domain wall .",
    "although our results are consistent with a single phase transition , we do not have sufficient data to rule out the possibility that there could be two separate phase transitions in our model , as further discussed below .",
    "to gain further insight into our numerical results , we have also used the mean - field approximation developed by shih and stroud @xcite to find the relevant eigenmodes near the phase transition at @xmath118 . near @xmath118 ,",
    "the linearized mean - field equations are @xmath239 where @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",

    "the hamiltonian is periodic with a unit cell of @xmath244 , which implies that eq .",

    "@xmath101 is given by the condition that the determinant of the matrix of coefficients should vanish .",
    "this requirement leads to two values of @xmath245 ; each is fourfold degenerate .",
    "thus , the transition temperature in the mean - field approximation is @xmath246 .",
    "the four degenerate eigenmodes corresponding to this eigenvalue are @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and @xmath250 ; these modes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenmode ] . of course",
    ", any linear combination of these modes would also be an eigenmode . since the four eigenmodes are degenerate",
    ", they must be related by some discrete symmetry operations of the lattice .",
    "thus , we might expect that there are several degenerate ground states .",
    "indeed , our simulations at very low temperatures ( @xmath251 ) do suggest that the system can readily fluctuate among several different states at such temperatures .",
    "we have investigated the phase transition in a fully frustrated 3d xy model on a simple cubic lattice , corresponding to an applied magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath184 as in ref.@xcite , we see a _ continuous _ phase transition .",
    "we also extract the critical exponent ratios @xmath252 , @xmath213 , and , with less accuracy , @xmath8 itself , using a variety of numerical techniques .",
    "we get @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath236 .",
    "it is of some interest to compare these values with those of other models . in the isotropic ( unfrustrated )",
    "3d xy model , @xmath253 @xcite , @xmath254 @xcite ( @xmath255 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and @xmath256 @xcite . for the _ anisotropic _ but unfrustrated xy model in @xmath16 , ref .",
    "@xcite reported that @xmath257 . in the weakly frustrated xy model in @xmath16 ( @xmath258 , with @xmath259 )",

    "@xcite found that @xmath263 in a random - coupling 3d xy model with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath264 .",
    "our value of @xmath8 satisfies the usual trend that @xmath8 becomes larger than @xmath265 when the magnetic field is nonzero .",
    "however , our results appear not to satisfy the two hyperscaling laws @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "possibly the reason is that at this phase transition , two order parameters go to zero : the helicity modulus , and a discrete , ising - like order parameter related to the amplitude of the structure factor at a characteristic wave vector .",
    "the @xmath118 we obtain from the prg method for @xmath104 agrees very well with that found from the rgt method , and quite well also with that estimated from @xmath268 .",
    "it is , however , about @xmath269 lower than that obtained by the mean - field approximation .",
    "this deviation is not a surprise , because the monte carlo @xmath101 has been shown to be lower than that found by mean - field theory in other frustrated xy systems @xcite .    in order to avoid the problem of critical slowing down , instead of just increasing the number of monte carlo steps , one might attempt to use the cluster flipping algorithm , as first proposed by swendsen and wang @xcite , and later by wolff @xcite , and many others @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is very successful in reducing critical slowing down for unfrustrated models such as the @xmath270 @xmath271 model and the potts model .",
    "but when the system is frustrated , especially fully frustrated , a mere extension of the cluster algorithm does not reduce the critical slowing down , and may even _ increase _ the correlation time @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the cluster percolation temperature @xmath272 is much larger than @xmath101 in the frustrated system , rendering the cluster flipping trivial at @xmath118 because the percolating cluster takes up almost the entire system .",
    "therefore , the cluster should be generated in such a way that @xmath272 is closer to @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "critical slowing down might also be reduced if the standard metropolis algorithm is combined with the cluster algorithm , resulting in a hybrid algorithm @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group transformation method is based on certain assumptions which may lead to systematic errors @xcite .",
    "specifically , it assumes that the blocked system has a typical phase configuration of another 3d xy model on a simple cubic lattice with @xmath273 , i.e. , that they appear with the correct boltzmann probabilities as the original states .",
    "this assumption is not exactly correct , and contributes to some systematic error , which can not be easily estimated . in the present paper , we have tried to estimate these errors using the jackknife method .",
    "the renormalization group method is also affected by finite - size effects , because the original system has a different size than does the rescaled system . to optimize the benefits of this method , therefore",
    ", we should ideally run simulations on as large a system as possible .",
    "we should also do an extra simulation on a system whose size is the same as that of the rescaled system , and compare the two results .",
    "we also comment briefly on the difference between our work and that of diep _ et al .",
    "these authors did not compute the helicity modulus , nor did they comment on the connection between the model and a superconducting array in a magnetic field .",
    "in addition , because of the several techniques described above , we are able to get more accurate values of the ratio @xmath197 , as well as values for @xmath117 and of @xmath8 itself .    finally , we briefly discuss the possibility that the phase transition at @xmath101 might actually be two separate phase transitions . in the 2d fully frustrated xy model , as already mentioned , there are indeed two separate phase transitions : a kt transition at a lower temperature , followed by an ising - like transition at a slightly higher temperature @xcite between a state in which the vortices are ordered in a checkerboard pattern and a disordered vortex state . in the present case",
    ", the transition at @xmath101 also involves the nearly simultaneous disappearance of 3d xy order ( signaled by the vanishing of the helicity modulus ) and a discrete order parameter ( indicated by the vanishing of the vortex structure factor ) .",
    "once again , in 3d , the discrete order is characterized by a checkerboard configuration of the vortex state below @xmath101 ( see figs.[fig : densitytc][fig : densitysf ] ) , although in this case the discrete order parameter is described by four degenerate modes , as determined by the mean - field solution , rather than two as in the 2d fully frustrated xy model @xcite .    although the discrete and xy order appear to vanish at the same temperature in 3d , and there is no evidence of two separate phase transitions",
    ", we believe that our numerical results are not sufficient to conclusively rule out two separate phase transitions .",
    "in particular , we have not carried out careful numerical studies of the critical behavior of the _ discrete _ order parameter .",
    "it would be of interest to carry out further numerical studies , especially of the discrete order parameter , to answer this question definitively .    to summarize , we have studied the phase transition in the fully frustrated xy model , using monte carlo simulations in conjunction with two types of real - space renormalization group approaches .",
    "we find , in agreement with previous work , that the phase transition is continuous , and we obtain accurate values of the critical exponents @xmath197 and @xmath117 , and a slightly less accurate value for @xmath8 itself .",
    "the phase transition could , in principle , be probed experimentally in a suitable three - dimensional lattice of coupled superconducting grains , and possibly also in an assembly of cold atoms in an optical lattice .",
