    "it is now possible , using a variety of techniques , to assemble well - defined and large samples of galaxies at redshifts spanning most of the hubble time , from the present to @xmath2 .",
    "while many of the global properties of these galaxies  such as their luminosity function , clustering , and contribution to the star formation rate density  have been , or are , in the process of being characterised , there have been relatively few studies to date of their individual properties , such as their stellar populations and chemical enrichment , particularly at @xmath3 .",
    "the simple reason is that , at these redshifts , the faintness of all but the brightest galaxies makes spectroscopic observations challenging , even when using the largest aperture telescopes in the world in conjunction with highly efficient spectrographs .",
    "nevertheless , a small number of detailed observations , which have targeted the brightest members of the population , have begun to provide some insight into the chemical properties of high redshift galaxies .",
    "a number of authors , including @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , have used nebular emission lines of [ ] , [ ] , and h@xmath4 ( the @xmath5 method of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to measure the oxygen abundance of the ionized gas in galaxies at @xmath6 selected with the lyman break technique @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that the brightest of these lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) appear to be neither supersolar nor as metal poor as the damped ly@xmath7  systems at comparable redshifts .",
    "unfortunately , a degeneracy in the @xmath5 calibration can lead to uncertainties of up to one order of magnitude in the derived oxygen abundance .",
    "more recently @xcite have extended this work to using [ ] and h@xmath7 ( the @xmath8 index discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to show that galaxies at @xmath9 that are bright at rest - frame optical wavelengths are also metal - rich , with near - solar values of ( o / h ) . however , one drawback of methods based on nebular emission lines from h  ii  regions is that , at these redshifts , most of the lines used as abundance diagnostics fall at near - infrared wavelengths . in this",
    "spectral region observations from the ground are made difficult by a multitude of strong night sky emission lines and by the limitations of current detector technology .",
    "it is simpler , observationally , to perform optical rather than infrared spectroscopy and thereby study the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of high redshift galaxies .",
    "such spectra consist of the integrated light from the hot and luminous o and b stars in the galaxy ( _ the stellar spectrum _ ) on which are superimposed the resonant absorption lines produced by the interstellar gas ( _ the interstellar spectrum _ ) . by exploiting the large wavelength coverage and high efficiency of the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ) on the keck telescope , @xcite obtained a high resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) optical spectrum of the gravitationally lensed lbg ms1512cb58 at @xmath10 . from a detailed analysis of the interstellar absorption lines ,",
    "these authors were able to determine , for the first time , the abundance pattern of many elements in a lyman break galaxy . as well as indicating a relatively high metallicity , @xmath11 , their results suggest a rapid timescale for the metal enrichment , of the order of a few hundred million years . such in - depth studies are , however , observationally very demanding and with present means can only be carried out on a few exceptionally bright galaxies .    to overcome these difficulties we consider in this paper a novel technique for abundance determinations based on the rest - frame uv _ stellar _ spectrum .",
    "such a technique has of course been applied extensively to the analysis of the optical spectra of _ old _ stellar populations , such as in elliptical galaxies , for the last twenty years through the well - established system of ` lick indices ' @xcite .",
    "however , its possible extension to the uv spectra of star - forming galaxies has not been addressed up to now . and",
    "yet , even at relatively low resolution and s / n , the rest - frame uv spectra of high redshift galaxies show a rich variety of stellar features which are mostly photospheric blends of absorption lines , as well as lines produced in stellar winds .",
    "it is thus worthwhile exploring to what extent the stellar spectrum can yield new metallicity probes ( see , for example , the very recent work by * ? ? ?",
    "as the integrated stellar spectrum from a whole galaxy has contributions from many different types of stars , it is not straightforward to extract information about the underlying stellar population . nevertheless , progress in this direction can be made by employing spectral synthesis codes such as _ starburst99 _ ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "such codes consider a particular star formation law and stellar mass function and use theoretical evolutionary tracks to evolve the stellar population with time .",
    "employing empirical libraries of stellar spectra to sum the contributions from individual stars , the codes can then predict the evolution of the population s integrated uv spectrum . by comparing an observed spectrum with those synthesized with a range of different model parameters , it is then possible to constrain the properties of the underlying young stellar population [ see @xcite for a review ] .",
    "the original empirical libraries adopted by _ starburst99 _ were compiled from observations of galactic stars obtained by the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ satellite . in order to assess the sensitivity of the stellar spectrum to metallicity , a lower metallicity library was later appended following a _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ programme to observe hot stars in the metal - poor large and small magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "the success of this work demonstrated the potential of using spectral synthesis modelling to determine the metallicity of stellar populations , as discussed in more detail below (  [ subsec : sensitivity_z ] ) .",
    "however , galactic and magellanic clouds stars only sample a narrow range of metallicities .",
    "a major drawback for extending the empirical libraries of stellar spectra to other metallicities is that only relatively nearby stars can be observed with _ hst _ at the required spectral resolution and s / n . even enlarging the libraries to include other local group galaxies would be challenging and observationally expensive while providing little increase in metallicity parameter space . with no prospects in the foreseeable future for extending the empirical libraries to higher and lower metallicities",
    ", it may appear as if we have reached a limit to this type of analysis .    here",
    "we propose that a solution to this problem is to replace the empirical libraries in _ starburst99 _ with theoretical ones .",
    "a similar approach has been recently developed for the lick indices by @xcite and @xcite . besides increasing the range of metallicities that can be investigated , theoretical spectra offer the additional benefits of a wider wavelength coverage and the possibility of altering the relative abundances of different elements , as well as the overall degree of metal enrichment , thus catering for a variety of star formation histories .",
    "this flexibility may be particularly important when dealing with galaxies in the distant past , when the dominant mode of star formation may have been quite different from that commonly encountered in the nearby universe .",
    "fortunately , the increasing sophistication of modern hot star model atmosphere codes makes it possible to predict the emergent uv spectra from stars of different structural parameters and stellar wind properties .",
    "we have therefore used the non - lte line - blanketed model atmosphere code _ wm - basic _",
    "@xcite , which includes the effects of stellar winds and spherical atmospheric extension , to create theoretical libraries of stellar spectra over a range of metallicities (  [ subsec : wmbasic ] ) and integrated these libraries into _ starburst99 _ (  [ subsec : starburst99 ] ) .",
    "the outputs of _ starburst99 _",
    "models thus produced compare favorably with more conventional models based on empirical libraries of stellar spectra (  [ subsec : comp_emp_spec ] ) .",
    "the coupling of state - of - the - art codes from the fields of hot stars and starburst galaxies has allowed us , for the first time , to investigate the sensitivity of the integrated spectrum of a star - forming region to metallicity from @xmath12 to @xmath13 (  [ sec : synthetic_spectra ] ) .",
    "we consider in particular three blends of photospheric lines from ob stars  centered at 1370 , 1425 , and 1978  and conclude that the last one of these is probably the most suitable for stellar abundance determinations . in ",
    "[ sec : lbg_comparison ] we compare our models with keck observations of two bright star - forming galaxies and find that the metallicities deduced from the stellar line indices agree to within a factor of @xmath14 with the values measured in the interstellar media of these galaxies using established techniques .",
    "we discuss the results and draw our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we describe how we first generated theoretical spectral libraries with _ wm - basic _ and then incorporated them into _",
    "starburst99 _ , in order to create a code capable of modelling the uv spectral features of star - forming regions over a range in metallicities .",
    "note that although _ wm - basic _ permits a free choice of metallicities , the evolutionary tracks and model atmospheres employed by _",
    "starburst99 _ are restricted to metallicities of 2 , 1 , 0.4 , 0.2 and 0.05@xmath15 .",
    "for this reason , we created theoretical libraries at these five metallicities .        in order to predict the emergent stellar flux at different wavelengths ,",
    "it is necessary to produce a realistic model of the atmospheric structure of a star .",
    "for hot , massive stars this requires a substantial effort because the physical conditions in their atmospheres are complex and very different from those considered in standard models .",
    "they are dominated by the influence of the radiation field , which has an energy density larger than , or of the same order as , the energy density of atmospheric matter .",
    "this has two important consequences .",
    "first , severe departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) are induced , because radiative transitions between ionic energy levels become much more important than those caused by inelastic collisions between ions and electrons . as a result , we encounter non - lte effects in the entire atmosphere of massive hot stars .",
    "second , hydrodynamic outflows of atmospheric matter ( stellar winds ) are initiated by line absorption of photons transferring outwardly directed momentum to the atmospheric plasma .",
    "the velocity fields of these outflows are mostly subsonic in the stellar photospheres , where the weak photospheric lines are formed , but become highly supersonic above the photosphere , where the stronger spectral lines are formed . both non - lte and stellar winds affect the emergent energy distributions , ionizing fluxes and line spectra significantly and their effects need to be included in the spectral synthesis of hot stars ( for a detailed discussion see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "developing a code that solves the full complex set of coupled equations describing the physics of hot star atmospheres is a challenging numerical problem .",
    "these equations include the radiation hydrodynamics of the stellar wind ( with the radiative line force from millions of spectral lines ) , the statistical rate equations ( for determining the occupation numbers of different ionic species ) , the spherical radiative transfer equations for the spectral lines and the continuum , the energy equation and additional processes such as x - rays generated by shocks in the stellar wind outflow .",
    "it is not surprising that the development of such codes has become feasible only in recent years with increased computing power , improvements in numerical techniques , and expanded databases of atomic data .",
    "examples of these sophisticated new codes are _ cmfgen _",
    "@xcite , _ fastwind _",
    "@xcite , and _ wm - basic _ @xcite .    for the present work we chose to use the _ wm - basic _ code which has the important advantage of being extremely fast thanks to its use of a very advanced escape probability algorithm for the line transfer in expanding media .",
    "while this is an approximate treatment of the line transfer problem , it works very well when modelling the uv spectra of hot stars @xcite . for the population synthesis work described here",
    "the speed of computation is crucial , since one needs to synthesize and add together the many different stellar spectral types that contribute to the integrated spectrum of a young stellar population .    before explaining in more detail how we used the code for our purposes",
    ", we note here that _",
    "wm - basic _ treats the wind as homogeneous , stationary and spherically symmetric .",
    "although winds are known to be time - dependent and unstable , these assumptions seem to be reasonable approximations when modelling time- and population - averaged spectral properties ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "_ wm - basic _ also allows for the inclusion of the effects of the ionizing emission from randomly distributed shocks in the stellar wind outflow using the approach developed by @xcite . taking into account emission from shocks may be important for modelling correctly strong wind lines from high ionization stages such as , , , and @xcite , but photospheric and low ionization wind lines are unaffected by this process . since in this first step of our work",
    "we will focus on the spectral synthesis of photospheric line features , we decided not to include the effects of shock emission at this stage .",
    ".[fig : wmb_grid ] ]      _ wm - basic _ is distributed by a.w.a .",
    "pauldrach as freeware software on the world wide web and can be run on an ibm - compatible personal computer ( pc ) with a microsoft windows operating system , at least 350mhz cpu , 64 mb ram and 200 mb free disk space .",
    "for the purposes of this work , it was installed on a 2ghz pentium pc in cambridge and on a 1ghz athlon pc in hawaii , both with 512 mb ram . despite the sophistication of the code , the operation of _",
    "wm - basic _ is straightforward : the user specifies the stellar parameters of the star to be modelled and the program outputs the corresponding synthetic spectrum .",
    "we computed theoretical uv spectra for 87 grid points in the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram at each of the five metallicities selected , with an individual model taking between 35 and 80 minutes to run . as we required a high spectral resolution , for improved accuracy , we requested output resolutions of 0.6  and 0.25  in the wavelength ranges 9001150  and 11502124  respectively . in the remainder of this section",
    "we discuss the selection of the grid points , which are summarised in table  [ tab : wmb_grid ] and figure  [ fig : wmb_grid ] , and the other input parameters used by _ wm - basic_.    as the purpose of our grid of models was to create libraries of theoretical spectra from which _ starburst99 _ could then synthesise the integrated uv spectra of star - forming regions , we first assessed which stars make a significant contribution to the total uv light . this is not immediately obvious because while hotter and more luminous stars produce prodigious amounts of uv flux they are much rarer and shorter - lived than lower mass stars .",
    "simulations using _",
    "starburst99 _ with its empirical libraries show that @xmath16% of the uv light at 1450  and 1800  is generated by stars with zero age main sequence mass greater than 5@xmath17 . for this reason",
    ", we restricted our grid to stars evolving from ones with masses of at least this value .    to run realistic spectral synthesis models one must sample this upper part of the h - r diagram with sufficient grid points .",
    "starburst99 _ employs the evolutionary tracks of @xcite to evolve the stellar population with time , we used these tracks as a guide for which grid points to select .",
    "we chose points corresponding to both zero age and evolved stars with initial masses of 120 , 100 , 80 , 60 , 50 , 40 , 30 , 25 , 20 , 15 , 10 and 5 @xmath17 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : wmb_grid ] .",
    "the evolutionary tracks were used to specify the full set of stellar parameters at each grid point , namely luminosity @xmath18 , effective temperature @xmath19 and photospheric radius @xmath20 .",
    "we list these values in table  [ tab : wmb_grid ] .",
    "it is also necessary to specify the stellar wind properties . for simplicity",
    "we first discuss stars of solar metallicity .",
    "the terminal velocity @xmath21 of the wind of each star was determined from the empirical scaling formula of @xcite which relates @xmath21 to the effective temperature and photospheric escape velocity as follows : @xmath22 @xmath23 note that the photospheric escape velocity is defined as @xmath24^{0.5}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the photospheric gravity , @xmath20 is the photospheric radius and @xmath26 is the ratio of radiative thomson to gravitational acceleration .",
    "this last parameter takes into account the effect of thomson scattering in weakening the effect of the gravitational potential .",
    "we also had to estimate the mass loss rate @xmath27 from each star in the grid .",
    "one of the predictions of radiation - driven wind theory [ see @xcite for details ] is that a wind momentum ",
    "luminosity relation exists such that @xmath28 for @xmath29 where the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 vary with spectral type and ( for o stars ) with luminosity class . by using the empirical calibrations by @xcite and the revisions by @xcite",
    ", we determined the wind momenta and hence mass - loss rates at most grid points .",
    "note , however , that the wind momentum - luminosity relationship of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , which seems to hold for supergiants and o - type giants , apparently breaks down in o - type dwarfs with luminosities @xmath32 . for these stars we adopted the relation @xmath33 to account for their much weaker winds .",
    "the same formula was applied to b - type giants and dwarfs with luminosities @xmath34 .",
    "for lower luminosities a very low value @xmath35 was adopted to simulate a very weak , unobservable , stellar wind .",
    "values of @xmath27 and @xmath21 for solar metallicity are listed in the last two columns of table  [ tab : wmb_grid ] .",
    "given that stellar winds are believed to be driven by the transfer of photon momentum due to the absorption and scattering of radiation by _ metal _ lines , it is expected that the wind properties will be sensitive to the metallicity . to test this assertion observationally ,",
    "the properties of galactic hot stars and those in the metal - poor large and small magellanic clouds have been compared @xcite . while there is clear evidence for smaller terminal velocities in smc stars @xcite ,",
    "further data are required to quantify the dependence of the mass - loss rate on metallicity .",
    "nevertheless , there is an obvious trend for smaller wind momenta in lower metallicity o stars , and investigations are now underway to see whether this is also the case for b and a supergiants . in our models we adopted the best theoretical estimates for the scaling of @xmath21 and @xmath27 with metallicity ,",
    "as given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite : @xmath36 @xmath37    note that the hydrodynamic structure of the _ wm - basic _ models is calculated by accounting for a radiative line force in the equation of motion , parameterized by a ` line force multiplier ' .",
    "in order to calculate models with pre - specified values of the mass - loss rate and terminal velocity , it is necessary to estimate values of this parameter . to this end",
    ", we used the analytical approach by @xcite in an iterative algorithm to provide the _ wm - basic _ code with force multipliers that yield the appropriate values of @xmath21 and @xmath27 as the result of the solution to the equation of motion .",
    "when running the grid at the five metallicities ( 2 , 1 , 0.4 , 0.2 and 0.05@xmath15 ) , we had the choice of using either ( i )  _ wm - basic s _ solar reference abundances scaled by a constant factor or ( ii )  our own choice of individual element abundances .",
    "we first consider the case of modelling star - forming regions within our galaxy of ` solar ' metallicity .",
    "two possible sets of element abundances are the solar scale and the orion nebula scale ; we compare them in table  [ tab : orion_abundances ] .",
    "the differences between the two , particularly in some of the element ratios [ e.g. ( n / o ) , ( mg / o ) and ( si / o ) ] are still a source of concern ; presumably they reflect unresolved systematic errors in either , or both , sets of measurements . in the present work",

    "element ratios can ( and do ) vary as a function of metallicity , reflecting the past history of star formation of a galaxy .",
    "departures from solar ratios are plausible in high redshift star - forming galaxies , given that these objects generally support much higher star formation rates than our galaxy did at any time in its past . under these circumstances , elements synthesized by long - lived stars , primarily iron and other fe - peak elements , may well be underabundant relative to the products of massive stars ( oxygen and other @xmath7-capture elements ) , as found by pettini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in ms1512cb58 .",
    "while one of the advantages of our fully theoretical approach to synthesizing the uv spectra of star - forming galaxies is that we could in principle choose any mix of elements , for this first attempt we decided to simply scale the orion nebula abundance pattern to different metallicities , keeping the relative element ratios fixed at their values in the @xmath50 model listed in table  [ tab : orion_abundances ] .",
    "if the results of the work presented here are sufficiently promising , it will be possible in future to generate models with different abundance ratios to , for example , determine the level of @xmath7-element enhancement in the galaxies under study .",
    "ours is the latest in a series of developments and improvements to expand the capability of the spectral synthesis code _ starburst99 _ since it was first released in september 1998 .",
    "the original version ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) did allow some parameters to be calculated at five metallicities ( 2 , 1 , 0.4 , 0.2 and 0.05@xmath15 ) thanks to the inclusion of evolutionary tracks and model atmospheres at these metallicities .",
    "however , it was only possible to synthesize the emergent _ ultraviolet spectrum _ of a star - forming region of solar metallicity because empirical stellar libraries were available only for milky way o - type stars .",
    "the inclusion of spectra of galactic b stars in october 1999 @xcite allowed the useful spectral range of the synthesized spectra to be extended to 1850   where these cooler stars make a significant contribution to the integrated light .",
    "the next major development to the code was the introduction in december 2000 of a library of o - type spectra assembled from _ hst _ stis observations of stars in the large and small magellanic clouds @xcite , giving the user the option to synthesize the uv spectrum of a population with a ` hybrid ' metallicity of about 1/4 solar , albeit over the restricted wavelength range 12501600 .",
    "most recently , @xcite created a grid of 230 expanding non - lte line - blanketed model atmospheres , at 2 , 1 , 0.4 , 0.2 and 0.05@xmath15 , and incorporated them into _",
    "starburst99 _ for the purpose of calculating realistic ionizing fluxes from young stellar populations .    @xcite utilized two sets of model atmospheres : the _ wm - basic _ code by @xcite for o stars and the _ cmfgen _ code by @xcite and @xcite for wolf - rayet stars .",
    "thus , their o - star models were calculated with the same code used in the present study .",
    "since @xcite focused on the emergent ionizing continuum below 912  and not on the line spectrum at longer wavelengths , the spectral resolution of their models is not sufficient for the absorption line studies that are the subject of this paper .",
    "however , the continuous spectra predicted by @xcite and by us are identical  unless wolf - rayet stars were important contributors to the continuum from the integrated stellar population , which is usually not the case .        for the present work",
    ", we built a non - public version of _",
    "starburst99 _ in which the empirical uv library of _ iue _ and _ hst _ spectra was replaced by the grid of theoretical spectra generated with _",
    "wm - basic _ as described in ",
    "[ subsec : wmbasic ] .",
    "most of the implementation followed the same steps as the standard version of _",
    "starburst99 _ , but with two significant differences , as we now explain .",
    "first , the theoretical spectra are not characterized by spectral types but by their effective temperatures and gravities .",
    "therefore , we can immediately link them to the positions in the h - r diagram predicted by the stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "this is a major advantage over empirical libraries because it avoids the intermediate step of having to adopt a spectral type vs. effective temperature calibration .",
    "recent theoretical and empirical work @xcite has shown that the effective temperature scale of o stars needs to be revised downward from previous calibrations .",
    "such a revision affects spectral synthesis models based on the empirical libraries but not those generated theoretically .",
    "second , model atmospheres predict both the idealized line - free continuum , and the apparent continuum which includes line blanketing .",
    "therefore we can link the theoretical spectra to the evolutionary models without having to normalize them first .",
    "empirical uv spectra are always affected by an unknown amount of the interstellar reddening . as a result",
    ", they must be rectified prior to adding them to a library .",
    "then , the rectified spectra are recalibrated to flux units by fitting a theoretical low - resolution continuum at each grid point in the h - r diagram .",
    "this process introduces additional uncertainties which are avoided when a purely theoretical method is employed .",
    "we performed extensive tests with the synthesized spectra .",
    "as discussed below (  2.3 ) , the computed photospheric features agree well with those generated with empirical stellar libraries . in addition , the stellar wind lines of  @xmath51 and  @xmath52 show reasonable agreement . however , we believe that a more detailed study of all wind lines is warranted ; since these lines are not utilized in the present analysis , their discussion is deferred to a future paper .",
    "once work on the wind lines is completed , we will release an updated version of the _ starburst99 _ code which includes the new theoretical libraries .    with our new , fully theoretical , code we can now model the spectra of star - forming regions as a function of time , for either an instantaneous burst or a continuous star formation law and with a choice of the initial mass function ( imf ) slope and mass range , for metallicities of 2 , 1 , 0.4 , 0.2 or 0.05@xmath15 .      before using our new code to investigate the effects of metallicity on the integrated stellar spectrum",
    ", we performed a ` sanity check ' by comparing the outputs of two of our _ starburst99 + wm - basic _ models with the corresponding model spectra generated in the conventional manner , that is using empirical libraries of stellar uv spectra .",
    "since the latter are available for two metallicities , corresponding to galactic and magellanic cloud stars respectively , we compared them with the fully theoretical spectra generated with @xmath53@xmath15  and 0.2@xmath15 .. we compare them with our closest theoretical libraries , for @xmath54 . in both the empirical and theoretical case , the evolutionary tracks used by _",
    "starburst99 _ are for @xmath55 . ]",
    "the comparison is illustrated in figure  [ fig : emp_theor_comp ] for our ` standard ' case of a continuous star formation model with a salpeter imf between 1 and 100@xmath17  ( see  [ sec : synthetic_spectra ] ) .",
    "the spectra generated with the _ wm - basic _ libraries were smoothed and normalised according to the procedures described in  [ subsec : continuum_fit ] .",
    "it is important to realise , when comparing the two sets of spectra , that they differ in their interstellar absorption .",
    "the empirical stellar spectra , obtained from observations of real stars , include the most prominent uv interstellar absorption lines which can be strong , particularly along sight - lines to the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the _ wm - basic _ spectra , on the other hand , do not suffer from this contamination and are purely stellar .",
    "when this difference is taken into account , figure  [ fig : emp_theor_comp ] shows that there is a reasonably good agreement between the spectra produced by the empirical and theoretical libraries at both metallicities .",
    "some of the discrepancies , such as those at wavelengths greater than 1700  in the solar metallicity models , appear to arise from the continuum normalization rather than from intrinsic differences .",
    "of particular interest for the present work are two blends of photospheric absorption lines , at 13601380  ( which also includes the weak stellar wind line  @xmath56 ) and 14151435 , which @xcite showed to be sensitive to metallicity .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : emp_theor_comp ] reveals a fairly good correspondence in these wavelength regions .",
    "having confirmed that our new version of _ starburst99",
    "_ produces results that are consistent with those generated by the empirical libraries , we can now turn to its application to the study of high redshift star - forming galaxies . in order to do so , it is necessary first of all to specify the mode of star formation .",
    "_ starburst99 _ considers two limiting cases , either an instantaneous ( i.e. unresolved in time ) burst in which all the stars form at time @xmath58 and the stellar population then evolves passively , or continuous star formation at a constant rate .",
    "this distinction is important for our purposes because in the burst scenario the integrated spectrum changes rapidly with time , on timescales of a few myr , reflecting the short lifetimes of the o and b type stars . in this limit ,",
    "the emergent spectrum is more sensitive to the age than the metallicity of the stellar population . on the other hand , in the constant star formation limit",
    ", a quasi - equilibrium is reached within a few tens of myr , after which there is little spectral variation with time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", we used our new version of _",
    "starburst99 _ to compute synthetic spectra , at time intervals of 5myr from 5 to 150myr , for each of the five metallicities considered . before analysing these spectra",
    ", however , it is necessary to perform a couple of processing steps , as we now explain .    in order to measure any spectral features ( whether wind , photospheric , or interstellar lines ) it is necessary to first normalize the spectra",
    "this process removes the shape of the underlying continuum by fitting an appropriate function to regions deemed to be free of emission / absorption features and then dividing the spectrum by this function .",
    "second , a comparison between observed and synthesized spectra is best carried out at comparable spectral resolution so that , in general , it is necessary to smooth one spectrum to match the resolution of the other . the important point to be aware of",
    "is that continuum fitting and spectral resolution are intimately related .",
    "this is because in reality there are very few , if any , wavelength intervals in the uv spectrum of a young stellar population that are truly free of photospheric absorption lines .",
    "thus , smoothing the spectrum invariably results in the depression of even relatively line - free regions and produces an apparent ` pseudo - continuum ' which is lower than the real continuum level , now no longer discernible .",
    "the primary motivation of this work is to generate a set of fully theoretical spectra which can be compared with those of star - forming galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the largest samples of such galaxies are from the spectroscopic surveys by steidel and collaborators @xcite conducted with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) on the keck telescopes .",
    "the resolution of this data set , fwhm@xmath72  in the rest frame , or @xmath73kms@xmath64  at 1500 , is the major source of line broadening , and dominates over the broadening from internal stellar processes , stellar rotation , and the velocity dispersion of the stars within a galaxy .",
    "we therefore simply convolved the synthetic spectra generated by _ starburst99 + wm - basic _ with a gaussian of fwhm@xmath74 . in order to define the continuum level , we used both our model spectra and actual spectra of lyman break galaxies to select ` pseudo - continuum ' points which are listed in table  [ tab : continuum_windows ] . for each model spectrum",
    ", we fitted a spline curve through the mean flux in each of these narrow windows and divided by this fit to produce a normalized spectrum . figure  [ fig : spline_fit ] shows some examples of the spline curves fitted to the models .",
    "figure  [ fig : synthetic_spectra ] presents the smoothed and normalised spectra of the 2 , 1 , 0.4 , 0.2 and 0.05@xmath15  models , 100myr after the onset of star formation ( by this time the stellar features in the composite uv spectrum have fully stabilised and show no residual time variation ) .",
    "examination of the figure shows that the spectral appearance _ is _ strongly altered by the presence of metals . the most obvious change ,",
    "as the metallicity decreases , is in the declining strengths of both the absorption and emission components of the stellar wind lines , especially  @xmath75 .",
    "such a marked dependence on metallicity has recently been reported in all the strongest stellar wind lines by @xcite in their study of star - forming regions in nearby galaxies at far - uv wavelengths with the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer_. while it may be tempting to calibrate these features in terms of metallicity , unfortunately ( for the present purposes )  @xmath76 is normally blended with strong interstellar absorption in the spectra of high redshift galaxies ( see , for example , fig .  4 of * ?",
    "furthermore , the strengths and profiles of these lines respond not only to metallicity , but also to the slope and upper mass cutoff of the imf (  [ sec : imf_comparison ] ) and to time dependent dust obscuration @xcite .",
    "although there have been attempts to interpret the ( and  @xmath77 ) lines in terms of metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a proper treatment requires careful deblending of the different components ( photospheric , wind , and interstellar ) which contribute to these composite spectral features .",
    "these complicating factors are much less important for the numerous blends of photospheric absorption lines which make up most of the uv spectrum of star - forming regions and which can also be seen from figure  [ fig : synthetic_spectra ] to scale with metallicity .",
    "following the inclusion of the low metallicity library of _ empirical _ stellar spectra into starburst99 , @xcite investigated the influence of metallicity upon the spectral appearance of a star - forming region .",
    "they drew attention to two blends of lines near",
    "1370  and 1425  ( which they attributed to  @xmath56 and  @xmath78 , and to  @xmath79 ,  @xmath80 , and  @xmath81 respectively ) and showed that the equivalent widths of these blends decrease by factors of 24 as the metallicity of the stellar population drops from solar to @xmath82 solar .    we can verify and extend these results with our _ starburst99 + wm - basic _ models .",
    "figures  [ fig : plot_ew_indices_1370 ] and [ fig : plot_ew_indices_1425 ] show the equivalent widths we measure for the ` 1370 ' and the ` 1425 ' line indices [ integrated , as prescribed by @xcite , over the wavelength ranges 13601380  and 14151435  respectively ] for different metallicities and ages .",
    "these measurements confirm that the lines indices increase monotonically with metallicity over the range @xmath83 considered here .",
    "equally important is the fact that the indices are stable after @xmath84myr from the onset of star formation , at which point a quasi - equilibrium is reached with approximately constant relative numbers of each type of star , even though individual stars continuously form and die .",
    "dependence on metallicity and stability with time are both necessary conditions to avoid a degeneracy between age and metallicity which would compromise the usefulness of a line index .",
    "although our model spectra support the initial suggestion by @xcite that the 1370 and 1425 indices may be useful metallicity indicators , these two spectral features are far from ideal for this purpose .",
    "first , they are weak , with equivalent widths of only @xmath85  at @xmath86 ; therefore their use as metallicity diagnostics requires data of high s / n .",
    "a second complication is the fact that these lines are blends of transitions from more than one element and therefore only give some ( poorly defined ) ` average ' metallicity .",
    "it would not be possible , for example , to use them to investigate departures of different elements from their solar ratios .",
    "finally , their far - uv wavelengths make them difficult to measure from the ground at redshifts lower than @xmath87 , thereby excluding the large numbers of star - forming galaxies now being discovered at these intermediate redshifts @xcite .",
    "aware of these restrictions , we considered other uv stellar features which do not suffer from the same problems .",
    "the most suitable candidate we have found is in the range @xmath8819002050 .",
    "the broad blend of lines in this region was identified thirty years ago with the _ s2/68 ultraviolet sky - survey telescope _ on board the td1 satellite which provided one of the first views of the sky at ultraviolet wavelengths . from spectrophotometric measurements of early - type stars at a resolution of 35 , @xcite reported the presence of a broad absorption region between 1900   and 1940 , which they attributed to line blocking by numerous photospheric transitions @xcite .",
    "a more extensive study by @xcite confirmed that many of the absorption features between 1800  and 2200  are indeed transitions .",
    "these authors also showed that the strength of the absorption is greater in b - stars of earlier types and higher luminosity classes .",
    "@xcite observed a similar trend for b stars in the large magellanic cloud and noted that the absorption is much weaker in o stars .",
    "in a conference proceedings , @xcite addressed the question of whether the feature is sensitive to metallicity by studying stars in the metal - poor small magellanic cloud .",
    "their results showed that , on average , the b star absorption is weaker at lower metallicities .    in a study of the ultraviolet properties of nearby starbursts , @xcite used _",
    "spectra of @xmath89 galaxies to create composite spectra with mean metallicities of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "their work showed that not only is the absorption clearly visible in the spectra of starburst galaxies but also confirmed that this feature is indeed stronger in higher metallicity environments .",
    "in addition to these encouraging preliminary indications , the absorption at @xmath92   overcomes many of the difficulties discussed above for the 1370 and 1425 indices .",
    "it is broader and stronger , it should be mainly sensitive to the iron abundance , and is accessible from the ground for galaxies down to @xmath93 .",

    "starburst99 _ do not extend to these mid - uv wavelengths .",
    "this is not a problem , however , for _ wm - basic _ , and the output from our runs was deliberately chosen to reach beyond 2000  ( see figure  [ fig : synthetic_spectra ] ) .",
    "the spectra shown in figure  [ fig : synthetic_spectra ] , which are the first to model the integrated spectrum of a star - forming region at mid - uv wavelengths , indeed confirm that the strength of the blend increases with increasing metallicity .    to assess its variation with both time and metallicity",
    "we have defined a new index , based upon the equivalent width measured between two appropriate wavelengths . in choosing these wavelengths",
    ", we took into consideration not only our synthetic models but also the observed spectra of lyman break galaxies , so as to avoid contamination with other spectral features .",
    "interstellar absorption lines are fortunately not a problem , provided we avoid  @xmath94 which can be strong ( the much weaker + blend at @xmath95 is less of a concern ) .",

    "although in good agreement with each other , these values are somewhat higher than @xmath140 determined for the interstellar gas (  [ subsec : cb58_comp ] ) . in q1307bm1163 we can only measure the 1978 index , because the 1425 blend is affected by a noise spike  see figure  [ fig : lbg_models_bm1163 ] .",

    ", it would seem that the hot star models tend to slightly underestimate the strengths of the photospheric blends at 1425  and 1978  at a given metallicity .",

    "[ fig : plot_ew_imf_variation ] ]      finally , we briefly consider the sensitivity of the 1425 and 1978 indices to the imf parameters . to this end",
    ", we generated a new set of synthetic spectra as described in ",
    "[ sec : synthetic_spectra ] , but with different imf prescriptions , and remeasured values of ew(1425 ) and ew(1978 ) at the five metallicities considered in this work .",
    "table  [ tab : imf_par ] gives details of the imf parameters considered .",
    "model ` a ' is our standard case of continuous star formation with a salpeter imf at age 100myr .",
    "model ` b ' has a steeper power - law slope ( @xmath144 in eq .",
    "[ eq : imf ] ) , and is thus close to the @xcite imf at the high mass end .",
    "model ` c ' has the standard salpeter slope but the imf is truncated at @xmath145 .",
    "thus , both models b and c have comparatively fewer high mass stars than model a.    as can be seen from figure  [ fig : plot_ew_imf_variation ] , decreasing the proportion of massive stars consistently increases the equivalent widths of the two blends ( at a given metallicity ) , reflecting the fact that these spectral features are strongest in late o and early b - type stars . however , there are other spectral changes which accompany these imf alterations .",
    "the most obvious one ( see figure  [ fig : plot_spectra_imf_variation ] ) is in the character of the  @xmath76 line which in models b and c no longer exhibits a discernible p - cygni component , as already noted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the empirical observation that lyman break galaxies normally show such p - cygni features  as demonstrated by the composite spectrum of @xcite  argues against significant departures from a salpeter imf ( at least for masses @xmath146 ) even at these early epochs .    .",
    "model a is for our standard case of continuous star formation with a salpeter imf at age 100myr .",
    "models b and c have comparatively fewer massive stars than model a. [ fig : plot_spectra_imf_variation ] ]",
    "rest - frame uv spectra of galaxies at redshifts @xmath3 are now being routinely obtained with large ground - based telescopes .",
    "current samples already include thousands of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and their numbers will continue to grow in the years ahead . encoded in all these spectra is information on the chemical composition of the galaxies which is one of the key physical properties for understanding their previous history and future evolution .",
    "potentially , knowledge of the relative abundances of the chemical elements in these galaxies can tell us about the accumulation of the products of previous stellar generations , the consumption of gas into stars , the pace of star formation activity , the initial mass function , and the importance of inflows and outflows in shaping the chemical evolution of galaxies in the distant past .    in this paper",
    "we have taken the first steps towards decoding some of this information . in order to do so ,",
    "we have found it necessary to synthesize _ ab initio _ the spectra of stars at the upper end of the h - r diagram and use them , via a spectral synthesis code , to predict the emergent uv spectrum of a composite stellar population as a function of metallicity .",
    "this approach was dictated by the practical difficulties with current facilities to assemble such a library of stellar spectra directly from observations and was made possible by the high degree of sophistication achieved by codes such as _ wm - basic _ and _ starburst99_. a further advantage of a fully theoretical method such as ours is that one has complete control over the wavelength coverage and resolution of the synthesized spectrum , as well as over the metallicity and relative abundances of individual elements .",
    "the results of this initial study are encouraging , in that theoretical and empirical spectra resemble each other closely and in detail  while the models may not be perfect yet , they provide a remarkably good representation of reality .",
    "we have focussed our attention on three blends of photospheric stellar lines , near 1370 , 1425 , and 1978 , and found that they are indeed mostly sensitive to metallicity . in the idealized case of a continuous star formation activity at a constant rate ,",
    "the equivalent widths of these three features vary little with time after approximately 50myr , and increase by factors of @xmath147 as the metallicity of the stars increases from 1/20 of solar to twice solar . of the three blends ,",
    "the one at 1978  may be the most useful because : ( a ) it is the strongest , with an equivalent width ew(1978)@xmath148  at solar metallicity ; ( b ) the wavelength interval 19352020  over which it is defined is free of strong interstellar lines ; ( c ) its rest - frame wavelength makes it accessible to ground - based spectroscopy over the redshift range @xmath149 where recent surveys for high redshift galaxies have been prolific ; and ( d ) it is due primarily to lines and thus measures the abundance of a single element rather than a combination of several .",
    "we have only been able to test the validity of our method in two cases , by comparing the synthetic spectra we generated with those of two bright high redshift galaxies , ms1512cb58 at @xmath10 and q1307bm1163 at @xmath122 .",
    "we find that in these two cases the metallicities deduced from the photospheric lines agree , to within a factor of @xmath14 , with those derived from analyses of interstellar absorption and emission lines .",
    "more extensive comparisons will allow us to refine the calibrations of our line indices in terms of metallicity .",
    "the principal conclusion of this work is that photospheric uv lines offer a much needed complementary avenue to determining the degree of metal enrichment in high redshift galaxies .",
    "the main weaknesses of the method we have developed are : ( a ) it is based on spectral features that are broad and shallow .",
    "thus , while they can be detected even in spectra of modest resolution , their measurement does require a moderately high signal - to - noise ratio , s / n@xmath150 per pixel at @xmath151 .",
    "( b ) the equivalent widths of the features in question depend on the mix of spectral types present in a star - forming region .",
    "thus , their strengths would vary with time in isolated bursts of star formation and , to a lesser extent , with the initial mass function .",
    "however , to date , neither single bursts nor departures from a universal imf ( at the upper mass end ) have been found to be common in high redshift galaxies .",
    "the main strength of the technique is its complementarity to other abundance measures : it is applicable precisely where other techniques fall short .",
    "abundance determinations from interstellar absorption lines require a combination of spectral resolution and s /",
    "n that is not achievable with current means for the vast majority of high redshift galaxies .",
    "circumventing this problem by co - adding spectra of many galaxies is fraught with dangers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since the absorption lines are normally on the flat part of the curve of growth , where their equivalent widths are much more sensitive to the velocity dispersion of the gas than to its column density ( and therefore metallicity ) .",
    "furthermore , most abundant elements are depleted onto dust in the interstellar medium ; correcting for unknown and variable amounts of dust depletion is a significant complication which has not yet been fully resolved even in qso absorption line studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "emission lines from regions , on the other hand , when observed at high redshifts are limited to the strongest lines which sample only a few elements ( primarily oxygen ) .",
    "the so - called ` strong line methods ' give estimates of the oxygen abundance that are only accurate to within a factor of @xmath14 [ see , for example , the discussion by @xcite ] , comparable to the accuracy of the photospheric uv line method explored here , at least on the basis of initial tests . furthermore , there are only a few redshifts intervals at @xmath3 where the nebular lines required for abundance measurements all fall within near - ir windows accessible from the ground , and even then contamination by strong sky emission lines is often a limiting factor to the measurement of reliable line ratios .",
    "looking ahead , there are thus strong motivations for continuing the work we have begun by : ( a ) incorporating future improvements in _ wm - basic _ into our hybrid code and , ( b ) most importantly , performing more extensive cross - checks between abundances deduced from nebular emission lines and with our photospheric uv absorption line technique , in cases where both methods are applicable . with a reliable calibration of the latter in hand",
    ", we would then have the means to measure stellar abundances in a wholesale manner over a wide range of cosmic epochs .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to adi pauldrach and his collaborators for making the _ wm - basic _ code freely available and for their kind assistance in the initial stages of this project .",
