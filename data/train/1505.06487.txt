    "[ sec : intro ]    hot subdwarf stars are located between the upper main sequence and the white dwarf ( wd ) sequence in the hertzsprung - russell diagram . they are evolved , core - helium burning , low - mass stars ( @xmath9 ) with very thin hydrogen envelopes @xcite . among hot subdwarfs ,",
    "sdo stars ( @xmath10 ) represent a significantly smaller fraction than sdbs ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "spectroscopically , sdo stars show a large variety : the two main groups are the h - rich ( sdo ) and he - rich ( he - sdo ) stars .",
    "@xcite showed that a strong correlation exists among surface temperature , he and c , n abundances in he - sdo stars .",
    "canonical stellar evolution theory predicts that sdo stars evolve from sdb stars .",
    "whilst binarity is quite frequent among sdbs , with a binary fraction of about 50% @xcite , the fraction of binary he - sdos is very low @xcite .",
    "many sdo binaries are associated with a planetary nebula ( pn ) , like uu sge , v477 lyr and be uma @xcite .",
    "the sdo stars in these binaries are hotter and more massive stars in the immediate post giant branch stage .",
    "binaries with compact sdo stars evolve from sdb binaries and the @xmath12120 myr sdb lifetime is long enough for their pne to attenuate and become hardly detectable @xcite .    @xcite performed binary population syntheses and identified several evolutionary channels that lead to the formation of hot subdwarf stars . in close binaries that evolve through one or more common envelope (",
    "ce ) phases @xcite , the secondary is engulfed by the atmosphere of the primary while it is on the red giant branch .    as the secondary spirals inward due to tidal friction",
    ", the red giant loses mass . by the end of the ce phase",
    "the primary loses most of its envelope and the binary orbital period shrinks to a few hours . if the core gained enough mass for he ignition during the preceding evolution the primary experiences a he - flash and settles on the extreme horizontal branch . in case",
    "the core mass is insufficient for he burning , the primary evolves as a low - mass pre - white dwarf . in both cases the common envelope is ejected during the final stage of ce evolution and a very close binary remains @xcite .",
    "while this theory can explain the mass loss required for the formation of hot subdwarfs , it also needs a precise timing between mass loss and the core helium flash .",
    "eclipsing hot subdwarf binaries with irradiated companions can give insight into the details of these processes , making such binaries fundamental to understand ce evolution .",
    "here we report the discovery of a new eclipsing binary with an sdo primary and a strongly irradiated red dwarf companion . after describing the observations",
    ", we discuss the spectral modelling and determination of the stellar and orbital parameters from the spectroscopic and light curve analysis .",

    "j0640 + 3856 ) was discovered serendipitously during regular astrometric observations of minor planets . on one of the images the object completely disappeared , suggesting a sudden deep eclipse . we started to monitor j0640 + 3856 using the 0.6/0.9/1.8  m schmidt telescope at piszkstet observatory .",
    "we took ccd photometric observations on seven nights between december 2013 and february 2014 using johnson / bessell @xmath13 and cousins @xmath14 filters , and also without filters .",
    "the telescope was equipped with an apogee alta - u 4k@xmath154k ccd camera .",
    "the observations revealed that the period is 0.187  d and there is a strong reflection effect with an amplitude of @xmath120.5mag .",
    "the sudden and deep primary minimum suggested that the system might contain a hot and small primary star eclipsed by a cool secondary object .",
    "we obtained further observations via the service program on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) on la palma . in february and march 2014",
    "we observed two primary eclipses with sloan @xmath16 and @xmath17 filters and a secondary eclipse in @xmath17 band , using the acam imager @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced with standard procedures .",
    "the flat minima indicated that the eclipse depths are 6 and 5 mag , respectively , and the totality of the primary eclipse lasts for about 5.7min , while the eclipse duration is approximately 24min .    on march 1 , 2014 , we obtained two spectra using the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) and osiris spectrograph on la palma . due to the highly variable seeing we used a 1.23 arcsec slit providing a dispersion of @xmath18 / pixel and @xmath19 / pixel with the r2500v and the r1000b grisms , respectively .",
    "these low- and medium - resolution spectra were taken between 3850 - 7400   and 4400 - 6000  , and reached a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr)@xmath1230 with 540s exposure times .",
    "we acquired phase - resolved spectroscopy on march 6 , 2014 , using the wht and the dual - beam isis spectrograph .",
    "this was operated with the r600b / r600r gratings and a 1 arcsec slit , providing a resolution of @xmath20 / pixel in the blue and covering the 3800 - 5200  and 6200 - 7800  regions .",
    "since the @xmath21 line was weak , we did not use the red region in the analysis .",
    "we took ten spectra between orbital phases @xmath22 and @xmath23 with 600s exposure times .",
    "the average snr of these spectra is 25 .",
    "all spectroscopic data were reduced with our iraf based data reduction pipeline .",
    "bias and flat field corrections were done with the ccdproc task , raw spectra and arc calibrations were extracted with apall and wavelength calibrated with the identify / reidentify tasks .",
    "we identified @xmath12150 cuarne lines in the wht calibration data , that allowed for an eighth order legendre polynomial dispersion function with a root - mean - square ( rms ) @xmath120.1 .",
    "the gtc hgarnexe calibrations allowed us to identify @xmath1250 - 100 lines and use a sixth order dispersion function with rms@xmath120.6 .",
    "in april 2014 we obtained 1.5h ccd photometry with the 1 m rcc telescope at the piszkstet observatory , using an fli camera with a field of view of 9.4@xmath24@xmath159.4@xmath24 , with a sloan @xmath16 filter and 2@xmath152 binning giving a plate scale of 0.27@xmath25/pixel .",
    "in addition , we obtained @xmath1221h of fast photometry ( 5s exposure times ) in december 2014 and february 2015 using the same telescope with the ocelot camera ( an andor ixon+888 emcdd camera ) without filter , in order to search for any oscillations from the sdo star .",
    "we did not detect any significant periodic signal with amplitudes greater than 7mmag .    in order to detect whether any pn could be associated with the sdo",
    ", we took 27 h@xmath8-filter images with 120s exposure times with the same telescope in april 2014 .",
    "the composite image did not show any sign of a pn .",

    "the photometric mass ratio was found to be significantly smaller ( @xmath26 ) than the spectroscopic one . on the other hand , comparing the two solutions ( with adjusted or fixed mass ratios ) , we found that all the other adjusted parameters , and also the @xmath27 have remained within their 1@xmath28 values .",
    "this is a consequence of the small amplitude ellipsoidal variation , due to the minor oblateness of the secondary star and , therefore , the weak dependence of the light curve on @xmath29 . we therefore decided to keep the solution obtained with the fixed spectroscopic mass ratio and the derived astrophysical quantities were computed accordingly . considering the other quantities common to the spectroscopic and photometric analyses , while the light curve solution clearly confirms the spectroscopic temperature of the secondary , the local gravities were found to be higher .    using the spectroscopic mass ratio we found a mass of @xmath30 @xmath31 for the sdo star and @xmath32 @xmath31 for the companion , in agreement with a mid - m dwarf ( m6v ) classification .",
    "we note that although the spectroscopic mass ratio is higher , yet consistent with our light curve analysis , the poor quality of our spectra means it is not precisely determined .    comparing the spectroscopic and photometric @xmath33 values of the sdo primary , despite that the lower spectroscopic value is closer to expectations",
    ", the photometric result is evidently the more robust .",
    "this is because it is determined purely by the system geometry via the eclipse durations , which give the relative radii as a the function of @xmath34 .",
    "then , by the use of kepler s third law , one can see that @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , even a @xmath36 error in the mass of the primary would result in a @xmath37 dex discrepancy in its @xmath33 value .",
    "this is valid only for spherical stars with negligible tidal and rotational effects , but our solution ( i.e.  the low values of the fractional radii ) is consistent with the assumption that these effects play only a minor role in the system . as a consequence",
    ", we accept the high @xmath33 values obtained from the light curve analysis instead of their spectroscopic value and conclude that the sdo primary is a compact object on its way to the wd cooling sequence .",
    "turning to the adjusted atmospheric parameters of the secondary , its bolometric albedo ( @xmath38 ) was found to be greater than unity .",
    "this is not an unphysical solution , but implies that light from outside of a given photometric passband is being reprocessed and re - emitted in the passband .",
    "a similar situation has been found before for other systems ( ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for kic  10661783 , a totally eclipsing binary with a @xmath39 scuti component ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for the eclipsing sdob+dm binary v1828  aql ) ) .",
    "we also found an unusually high gravity darkening coefficient ( @xmath40 ) for the secondary . the large uncertainty",
    ", however , makes this result ambigous .",
    "we note that the relatively poor fit to the data in secondary minimum is likely due to the simplistic treatment of the most highly - irradiated part of the atmosphere of the secondary component , which is eclipsed during secondary minimum .",
    "a complete physical description of the phsyics in this atmosphere is not available in our code , or in other commonly available light curve modelling codes .",
    "we have discovered an sdo+m6v eclipsing binary ( ra=@xmath0 ; dec=@xmath1 ; j=2000.0 ; r@xmath2=17.2 mag ) that shows 6-mag deep primary eclipses and a @xmath120.5mag reflection effect .",
    "these are the most extreme variations among all hw  vir type binaries known to us and the primary minimum is even deeper than that of nn  ser , a well - known white dwarf with an extreme eclipse depth @xcite . with photometric and spectroscopic",
    "follow - up we constrained the atmospheric properties of the components and the binary orbit .",
    "although the specific spectral features and the effective temperature ( @xmath41 k ) classify the primary component as an sdo star , the surface gravity is at the upper limit of sdos ( @xmath42 cgs ) and the radius ( @xmath43 ) is smaller than for normal sdo stars .",
    "these parameters place the primary component in a special position , suggesting the sdo star is a pre - wd , similar to be  uma which is classified as a borderline object between sdo subdwarfs and dao white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of a pn around j0640 + 3856 also supports the evolved hot subdwarf ( post - sdb ) scenario .",
    "we have constructed a simple model to reproduce the spectral contribution of the irradiated companion .",
    "although this model is optimized for the substellar point , it represents the day side of the companion well , suggesting that the strong irradiation heats up the entire inner hemisphere homogeneously .",
    "our results suggests that the secondary component may be inflated by only a few percent , like in the cases of similar close binaries @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the substellar point of the red dwarf is heated to about 22500k .",
    "the heat transport of these inflated stars is ineffective , so the large temperature difference between the day and night sides is preserved over long timescales @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the most probable companion spectral type is mid - m .",
    "a later - type or more compact companion would be unable to reproduce the eclipses while an earlier type and more massive companion would be inconsistent with the radial velocity curve .",
    "the biggest advantage of j0640 + 3856 is that it is a double - lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "spectroscopic observations covering the full orbital cycle will yield more precise parameters ( especially masses ) for the components , as well as an opportunity to monitor and analyse the changing features in the spectra caused by the reflection effect .",
    "the j0640 + 3856 system is a good analogue to study interactions in planetary systems with hot jupiters .",
    "both the illumination effect in the primary minimum and the thermal radiation and reflected light disappearance and reappearance in the secondary minimum , is similar as is the luminosity ratio .",
