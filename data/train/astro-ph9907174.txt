    "the extragalactic radiation field and its evolution with redshift play an important role in our understanding of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and its constituents .",
    "ionizing photons , believed to be produced primarily by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) but with a potentially large contribution from starburst galaxies , permeate the igm and dominate the ionization of ly@xmath0 clouds , qso metal - line absorbers , and possibly high - latitude galactic clouds .",
    "tight constraints on the intensity and spectrum of this radiation are essential to the interpretation of igm observations .",
    "a direct measurement of the intensity of the ionizing background is impossible due to its attenuation by galactic and dust .",
    "thus , we must measure its effects on detectable gas and deduce its intensity and spectrum from the photon `` fossil record '' .",
    "typically , conclusions are hindered by the necessary introduction of model assumptions about the affected gas and by the inherent uncertainties of photoionization modeling .",

    "1999 ) have shown that the diminished opacity of the igm at low redshift implies that the shape of the extragalactic spectrum at @xmath9 approximates the intrinsic spectra of the ionizing sources .",
    "in contrast , the high-@xmath10 ionizing background spectrum is dominated by the effects of radiative transfer in the igm .",
    "thus , at low redshift , a first - cut picture of the extragalactic ionizing spectrum is the intrinsic spectrum of qsos , unaffected by attenuation due to the igm .",

    "the relative contribution of ionizing photons produced in ob associations in galaxies , however , is potentially very large .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath1  expresses the total fraction of lyman continuum ( lyc ) photons produced in a galaxy that escape its interstellar medium and halo and contribute to the extragalactic ionizing background .",

    "to constrain the ionizing flux from the local contribution of ngc 3067 , we reanalyzed the h@xmath0 images presented in stocke et al . (",
    "these images were obtained at the kpno 2.1 m telescope in july 1989 .",
    "the dataset consisted of two 20-min exposures through a narrow - band interference filter centered on the redshifted h@xmath0 wavelength ( @xmath34  , @xmath35 = 75  ) and a corresponding `` off - band '' image through a similar interference filter centered 400   longward of the first and chosen to avoid the redshifted @xmath366719,6731 doublet .",
    "the images were flat - fielded and calibrated so that 1 dn in the images equals @xmath37 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 incident on the telescope .",
    "using sky background well away from the location of the absorbing cloud , we scaled the overall background to identical mean values in the on - band and off - band images and then subtracted the latter from the former to produce a `` pure '' h@xmath0 image of the galaxy . in the pure h@xmath0 image we added up all the detected h@xmath0 photons in the immediate region of the galaxy to obtain an integrated h@xmath0 flux for the galaxy of 0.439 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 incident at the observer .",

    "these observations were carried out during hst cycle 6 in 1996 using the ghrs with the g270 m grating ( r  @xmath23  28,000),the ghrs large science aperture ( lsa ) , and post - costar optics .",

    "the actual shift could be as low as 5 km s@xmath6 , given the typical 0.1@xmath45 accuracy in pointing of the telescope .",

    "a summary of the detected lines appears in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "[ table2 ]    the most striking feature of the new spectra is the 30% increase in the mean level of the quasar continuum between the two epochs ( fos in 1992 and ghrs in 1996 ) .",
    "because this difference exists even after both spectra are calibrated with the best available calibration files , we attribute this increase to variability in the quasar .",

    "if this line width is purely thermal , then fe and mg should exhibit line widths correspondingly lower in proportion to their atomic masses . because we see lines in fe and mg that are @xmath55 km s@xmath6  broad , we must attribute this broadening in resolved lines to warm gas , velocity components , or high column density , which accentuates the high velocity tails of the particle distribution .",

    "indeed , a spherical cloud of constant density exhibits enhanced column density near its projected center . furthermore , in this case , uncertainties in the density profile are dominated by the larger uncertainty about the source of the ionizing radiation .",
    "because centrally condensed models require higher values of @xmath3  to match the observed @xmath59  and @xmath60 , our lower limit is not sensitive to the assumed profile .",
    "the limit is also insensitive to density clumps that may lie hidden in vla maps with @xmath23 50@xmath45 resolution . because we can not constrain the size and filling factor of these clumps , and given the relative insensitivity of our limit on @xmath3  to this subtlety , more complicated models are unjustified .",
    "the second class of models incorporate both qso and starburst contributions to the ionization of the absorbing cloud .",
    "these models keep the power - law form of the spectrum but contain a `` break '' at 13.6 ev , such that the continuum longward of the lyman limit is enhanced relative to the h - ionizing continuum .",
    "recent theoretical work by shull et al .",
    "( 1999 ) demonstrates that if @xmath1  @xmath23 0.05 , the contribution from galaxies to the extragalactic ionizing background may match the empirically evaluated contribution of agn . because an intrinsic lyman break is introduced by in stellar atmospheres and by the galactic ism",
    ", galaxies may contribute far more to the extragalactic fuv ( 912  1600  ) background than they add to the ionizing continuum . as a result ,",
    "an incident spectrum with a break at 13.6 ev may represent the extragalactic radiation background better .",
    "this is particularly relevant for @xmath59  and @xmath60 . the same general argument for a lyman break",
    "may be applied specifically to the contribution to the incident radiation by the local starburst galaxy ngc  3067 .",
    "we return to this point below .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] illustrates the schematic spectra we assume are incident on the model cloud .",
    "the solid curve represents the minimum level of the ionizing background from   4.1 required to satisfy the limits on @xmath59  and @xmath60 . if the flux at energies below 1 ryd is enhanced by at least a factor of two over that of the ionizing spectrum , the observational constraints @xmath59  and n ( ) may be satisfied independent of the level of ionizing radiation by appropriate choice of fuv flux .",
    "figures  [ fig7 ] and  [ fig8 ] illustrate the use of the quantities @xmath89 and @xmath90 to represent the levels of incident radiation just longward and just shortward of the lyman limit , respectively .",
    "although there is likely not a pure step function break in the spectrum at the lyman limit , these quantities schematically represent overall levels of fuv ( 912  1600  ) radiation ( @xmath89 ) and h - ionizing radiation ( @xmath90 ) . as figure  [ fig7 ] shows ,",
    "if @xmath91 , constraints on @xmath59  are satisfied independent of @xmath90 , and , by implication , independent of @xmath3 .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for n ( ) .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the levels of @xmath89 and @xmath92 allowed by the n ( ) constraint .",
    "if @xmath92 is assumed , the allowed values can be expressed in terms of an allowed `` break '' in the ionizing spectrum .",
    "if we fix @xmath3  @xmath93 2600 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 , we can vary the flux longward of 912   until the line in the model cloud is no longer observable . for this calculation",
    ", we assume a 3@xmath56 lower limit on n(mg  i ) @xmath94 @xmath5 and no depletion .",
    "the greatest break that accommodates the presence of mg i absorption is a factor @xmath23 150 , assuming the same range of densities as in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows contours of constant n ( ) in the model cloud for a varying break .",
    "the bold contour represents the minimum measured n ( ) ; thus , for @xmath3@xmath95 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 , @xmath96 and the break is constrained to @xmath97 .",
    "higher breaks are of course permissible for vanishing @xmath3 , and they do not violate the @xmath59  constraint ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "direct measurements of the extragalactic fuv background longward of 912   are very difficult , due to the need to subtract out local contributions to the observed radiation ( bowyer 1991 ; henry 1991 ; witt et al .",
    "1997 ) . in general , these highly uncertain estimates",
    "are consistent with an upper limit to the break of order 200  300 , assuming @xmath3  @xmath93 2600 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 .",
    "armand et al . ( 1994 ) suggest an integrated contribution from galaxies at 2000   consistent with a break of @xmath23 50  150 , again assuming @xmath3  @xmath93 2600 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 .",
    "the presence of in the ngc  3067  cloud is compatible with these estimates of the extragalactic fuv background .",
    "it is more difficult to argue that the local 912  1600   contribution of ngc  3067  may be neglected than it is to dismiss its contribution to the ionizing radiation incident on the cloud .",
    "our limit @xmath1  @xmath98 on the escape of ionizing photons becomes weaker for these lower - energy photons .",
    "as sutherland & shull ( 1999 ) show , synthetic starburst spectra have breaks in flux at 13.6 ev of @xmath99 for young starbursts , and @xmath100 for evolved ones .",
    "this result implies upper limits on the break due to ngc  3067  of @xmath101 even before considering the enhanced escape probability of photons in this energy range . in the opacity model of deharveng",
    "et al . ( 1997 ) , the local contribution of ionizing photons by ngc  3067  may arguably be neglected , but the neutral hydrogen required to account for the lyman continuum opacity does not impede the escape of fuv photons , so that ngc  3067  may produce a break of @xmath102 .",
    "the geometric scenario for @xmath1  is compatible with the inclusion of opacity , such as dust , which can also limit the escape of fuv photons .",
    "if dust is the primary source of fuv and lyc opacity , because @xmath1  @xmath103 , an optical depth @xmath104 across the 912  1600   band is required . using a standard selective extinction curve ( seaton 1979 ) and assuming that @xmath105 continues to increase shortward of 1040 ",
    ", we derive the limit @xmath106 mag , where the upper limit is due to the uncertainty in the exact form of the extinction curve shortward of 1000  . for the derived limit @xmath3",
    "@xmath107 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6  we obtain an upper limit to the v - band dust extinction @xmath108 mag . thus , dust opacity could contibute significant fuv opacity and modest optical extinction and should be incorporated into either formal model of @xmath1 .",
    "if the photons longward of 912   escape largely unimpeded from ngc  3067 , the presence of absorption implies that the gas associated with it must approach density @xmath109 @xmath110 , assuming that the mg is present at solar metallicity . at these densities , depletion may become significant , further increasing the constraints on the density .",
    "in addition , assuming that the opacity model of @xmath1  is the more accurate description , the emergent spectrum should be significantly hardened shortward of the lyman limit by the thick layer of that enshrouds the galactic disk .",
    "our photoionization modeling reveals that the indicator ratios @xmath59  and @xmath60  are insensitive to this hardening . however , the / and / ratios in the model cloud show moderate changes of 0.4  0.9 dex if the input spectrum is hardened by the thick disk in the opacity model .",
    "both the local and extragalactic interpretations presented above are subject to uncertainties in the total amount of gas present in the 3c 232 cloud , the size of the cloud , and the shape of the ionizing continuum .",
    "it is possible that the peak column density in this cloud measured by carilli & van gorkom ( 1992 ) and assumed in all the cloud models discussed here is an underestimate of the actual amount of in this cloud .",
    "the original emission maps were produced at vla in c array , with a 20@xmath45 by 30@xmath45 beam that was binned to 50@xmath45 to improve signal - to - noise . if these observations suffered from beam dilution , the actual column at the position of the quasar may peak at a far higher value .",
    "higher average values of the total hydrogen density @xmath77 , provided by a higher column density or by clumping , would increase the lower limit on @xmath3 .",
    "these changes effectively rule out the regions of parameter space shown above for all larger columns of and for centrally condensed density profiles .",
    "for example , a column @xmath111 @xmath5 requires that twice the gas be accommodated within the same physical size , such that the diameter contours in figure  [ fig6 ] shift to the right and the limit becomes @xmath3  @xmath112 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 .    for the case of purely extragalactic ionizing radiation ,",
    "our limits are insensitive to changes in the slope of the ionizing continuum . the limit @xmath3  @xmath4 2600 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6  changes by roughly 10% for changes in @xmath113 from 1.5 to 2.1 ( zheng et al .  1997 ) . because we rely exclusively on the ratios of different ions of the same elements , our limits are not sensitive to the abundance or depletions of these elements in the cloud .    of course ,",
    "the greatest uncertainty in these models is the unknown contribution of the nearby galaxy , ngc  3067 , to the ionization of the halo cloud . as",
    "discussed above , we can reasonably assume that little h - ionizing flux reaches the cloud .",
    "however , the apparent lack of opacity in the 7.6  13.6 ev range makes the metal - ionizing radiation field emergent from the cloud potentially important . only a dust component in the disk and halo of the galaxy",
    "would prevent these photons from escaping the disk .",
    "thus , the uncertainties of selective extinction in the far - uv are more important than modest upper limits to a@xmath114 .",
    "our absorption line spectra , narrow - band images , and extensive photoionization modeling of the 3c  232/ngc  3067 system allow us to limit the ionizing flux at the cloud to @xmath3  @xmath107 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6  if the ionizing spectrum is continuous .",
    "this limit is consistent with non - detections of h@xmath0 from intergalactic clouds , which provide upper limits to @xmath3  that are 4 times higher than the lower limit derived here .",
    "however , this model requires a small @xmath1  and a substantial fuv opacity to attenuate photons capable of ionizing and .",
    "our limit is derived from stringent 3@xmath56 upper limits to the column density of and a conservative interpretation of the velocity structure observed in mg i , mg ii , and fe ii .",
    "if this limit is relaxed from 3@xmath56 to 2@xmath56 in each undetected component then @xmath3  @xmath4 4300 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 .",
    "similary , if we assume only two undetected components corresponding to the two seen in the line , then @xmath3  @xmath4 4300 photons @xmath5 s@xmath6 . thus the assumed limits on produce a very conservative limit on @xmath3 .",
    "if ngc  3067  contributes significantly to the ionizing flux at the absorbing cloud , then strict constraints on the extragalactic radiation field are impossible and we are left with the robust limit on total @xmath1  given by the h@xmath0  images .",
    "the limit @xmath1  @xmath71 is significantly lower than previous measurements , but is consistent with theoretical treatments of escaping ionizing radiation .",
    "however , these two models predict radically different @xmath1 , and so should manifest themselves in distinct fashion .",
    "the opacity model proposed by deharveng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) predicts @xmath1  @xmath115 through a thick , uniform layer of .",
    "because this model relies exclusively on opacity , it predicts harder galactic spectra than the geometric model ( dove & shull 1994 ; dove et al .",
    "this difference may appear in the / and / ratios in clouds ionized by hardened galactic spectra .",
    "we note that the currently small sample of galaxies for which limits on @xmath1  have been obtained is not sufficient to allow these results to be generalized to all galaxies , or even to all starburst galaxies .",
    "an ensemble average @xmath1  taken from a larger sample of targets with varying morphology , viewing geometry , and star formation history is necessary before a reliable general estimate of @xmath1  can be made .",
    "further steps in this direction will be taken by the fuse satellite , which will observe two low - redshift starbursts shortward of the rest - frame lyman limit in an attempt to measure @xmath1  directly .",
    "there are several ways in which future hst observations ( with stis or cos ) could resolve existing unknowns in this system .",
    "in addition to estimating the extragalactic spectral index in the lyc , uv observations of and with hst / stis would determine the overall ionization state of the gas and probe the existence of a hot , collisionally ionized component .",
    "due to the beam dilution mentioned above , the measurement @xmath76 @xmath5 may be an underestimate of the total amount of present .",
    "if so , then this absorber is potentially a damped lyman @xmath0 ( dla ) system of very low redshift ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "dlas are commonly believed to arise in thick , extended disks ( wolfe et al .",
    "a key element of this picture is that the large neutral disks detected as high-@xmath10 dlas have evolved without merging .",
    "this view has been disputed by the theoretical simulations of haehnelt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who argue that dlas arise in irregular merging protogalactic clumps .",
    "the ngc  3067 cloud , if it is a dla , would suggest that these objects can also arise , at least at low redshift , in interacting systems",
    ". a stis / fuv observation of the cloud s ly@xmath0 absorption profile along a pencil - beam line of sight would not be subject to either the 21-cm absorption bias or beam dilution , and would allow the absorber to be firmly classified",
    ".    finally , a stis / g140l ( @xmath117 ) spectrum could measure many key abundances ( s , si , c , o , and ni ) .",
    "these metal lines should follow a linear curve of growth , as do the metal lines in the ngc  3067 cloud presented here .",
    "based on the numerical models presented here , fuv lines of at should easily be detectable , as should lines of .",
