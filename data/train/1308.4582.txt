    ", we refer to @xcite .    in general , it is a highly nontrivial task to design quantum codes for any given noise model . in the majority of cases ,",
    "researchers have focused on the error correction of pauli - type errors .",

    "furthermore , aiming at designing quantum codes capable of error - correcting general noise errors may not be the most fruitful way to combat decoherence and noise in quantum computers .",
    "a very common type of noise that appears in realistic settings is the so - called amplitude damping ( ad ) noise model @xcite .",
    "for instance , the ad noise model is employed to describe the photon loss in an optical fiber .",
    "the ad channel is the simplest channel whose kraus operators can not be described by unitary pauli operations .",
    "the two non - unitary kraus operators for the qubit ad channel are given by @xcite,@xmath3   \\text { and , } a_{1}\\overset{\\text{def}}{=}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma}}{2}\\left (   \\sigma_{x}+i\\sigma_{y}\\right )   = \\sqrt{\\gamma}\\left\\vert 0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right\\vert \\text { , } \\label{a0}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes the * * amplitude damping probability parameter .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we point out that ad channels acting on states characterized by higher photon numbers in combination with a finite number of modes can also be considered . for instance , qubits living in a two - dimensional hilbert space can be replaced by bosonic states of higher photon numbers in a finite number of optical modes @xcite . in general , the operator - sum decomposition of such higher - dimensional noise models is characterized by error operators * * @xmath5 * * with * * @xmath6 * * , ... , * * @xmath7 * * and , in principle , * * @xmath7 * * can approach infinity @xcite .",
    "we observe that there is no simple way of reducing @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ a0 ] ) to one pauli error operator , since @xmath9 is not normal .",
    "the pauli operators are remarkable in that they are unitary and hermitian at the same time and , in addition , both unitary and hermitian operators are normal .",
    "although the * * five - qubit code @xcite can be successfully used for the error correction of ad  errors , since it is a * * universal @xmath10-error correcting quantum code , leung et _",
    "al_. were capable of designing a four - qubit quantum code especially suitable for the error correction of arbitrary single - ad errors with a higher encoding rate equal to @xmath11 ( greater * * than @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a quantum code with higher encoding rate is very welcome , since it would require less resources for its implementation .",
    "the two main points advocated in @xcite were the following : first , when dealing with specific error models , better codes may be uncovered ; second , the fulfillment of the approximate ( relaxed ) qec conditions enlarges the realm of possible useful quantum error correcting codes .",
    "therefore , it can simplify the code construction process .    both * * the five - qubit and four - qubit codes are nondegenerate stabilizer ( additive ) quantum codes @xcite",
    ". however , the scientific literature accommodates a fairly wide variety of additional ad error correction schemes where neither additive nor nondegenerate quantum codes are employed .",
    "for instance , one of the very first qec scheme used to combat ad  errors was quite unconventional , since it used bosonic states of higher photon numbers in a finite number of optical modes ( the so - called bosonic quantum codes , @xcite ) .",
    "more conventional and recent works are inspired by the seminal work presented in @xcite . in @xcite , using the stabilizer formalism , generalizations of the leung s et _",
    "al_. four - qubit code for higher rates were constructed . specifically , a class of @xmath13   \\right ]   $ ] channel - adapted quantum codes for integers @xmath14 with encoding rate arbitrarily close to @xmath15 are generated . in @xcite ,",
    "the performance of qec schemes for the ad model has been investigated via semidefinite programs ( that is , numerical convex optimization methods @xcite ) . specifically , the optimal recovery operation to maximize the entanglement fidelity @xcite for a given encoding and noise process was uncovered .",
    "unfortunately , numerically computed recovery maps are difficult to describe and understand analytically .",
    "furthermore , recovery operations generated through convex optimization methods suffer two significant drawbacks .",
    "first , the dimensions of the optimization problem grow exponentially with the length of the code , limiting the technique to short codes .",
    "second , the optimal recovery operation may be quite difficult to implement , despite being physically legitimate .",
    "however , this exponential growth can be mitigated in two manners .",
    "first , it is possible to reduce the high dimensionality of the convex optimization procedures for generating recovery operations in qec by transforming the problem in a suitable manner .",
    "consider a quantum noisy channel @xmath16 with @xmath17 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 . by embedding the encoding into the noise process and redefining @xmath20 as a quantum spreading channel with @xmath21 strictly less than @xmath22 , the dimensionality of the convex optimization decreases from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath25   \\right ]   $ ] five - qubit code , the dimensionality reduces from @xmath26 to @xmath27 in terms of the optimization variables . for more details , we refer to @xcite .",
    "second , if the focus is on near - optimal rather than on optimal recovery schemes , it turns out that it is possible to compute such recovery operations with less computationally intensive numerical algorithms that are more scalable than those involved in semidefinite programs .",
    "briefly speaking , regarding the algorithm in terms of eigenanalysis , it is possible to significantly reduce the size of the eigenvector problem and this has a significant effect on the computational cost of these new algorithms . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "consider the ad channel and an @xmath28 \\right ]   $ ] quantum code . in this case",
    ", the dimensionality of the full optimal semidefinite program grows as @xmath29 .",
    "instead , if one considers the semidefinite programs for the first- and second - order subspaces , the dimensionality of the approximate programs only grows as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "for instance , using the @xmath32   \\right ]   $ ] css seven - qubit code , the full optimal semidefinite program requires @xmath33 optimization variables .",
    "however , the first - order semidefinite program requires @xmath34 variables and the second - order semidefinite program has @xmath35 optimization variables . for further details ,",
    "we refer to @xcite . in particular , in @xcite , to mitigate such drawbacks of the optimal recovery , a structured near - optimal channel - adapted recovery procedure was determined and applied to the ad noise model . in @xcite , an analytical approach to channel - adapted recovery based on the pretty - good measurement and",
    "the average entanglement fidelity appeared .",
    "following @xcite , a simple analytical approach to approximate qec based on the transpose channel was derived and used for the ad noise model in @xcite . in particular , it was shown in @xcite that the transpose channel is a recovery map that coincides with the perfect recovery map for codes satisfying the perfect knill - laflamme * * qec conditions @xcite .",
    "very recently , it was also proved that the transpose channel works nearly as well as the optimal recovery channel , with optimality defined in terms of worst - case fidelity over all code states @xcite . as a side remark",
    ", we underline that no definitive choice for the best figure of merit in quantum information processing tasks has been made yet @xcite and this fact becomes especially relevant when quantifying the performance of quantum codes @xcite . in @xcite , focusing on the ad noise model , it was shown that fidelity alone may be not sufficient to compare the efficiency of different error correction codes . in @xcite , a numerical search based upon a greedy algorithm @xcite",
    "was employed to construct a family of high rate nonadditive quantum codes adapted to the ad noise model that outperform ( in terms of encoded dimension ) the stabilizer codes presented in @xcite . in @xcite , families of high performance nonadditive quantum codes of the codeword stabilized ( cws , @xcite ) type for single ad - errors that outperform , in terms of encoded dimension , the best possible additive codes were presented .",
    "these code families were built from nonlinear error - correcting codes for classical asymmetric channels or classical codes over @xmath36 .",
    "finally , for the sake of completeness , we also point out that a method for the construction of good multi - error - correcting ad codes that are both degenerate and additive can be found in @xcite .    taking into account all these above - mentioned facts",
    ", we emphasize that there is :    * no clear understanding of the role played by degeneracy in the analysis of the performance of stabilizer quantum codes for ad errors , @xcite ; * no explicit evidence of the relevance of the role played by self - complementarity in the analysis of the performance ( quantified by means of the entanglement fidelity ) of nonadditive quantum codes , @xcite ; * no explicit analytical computation of the entanglement fidelity of arbitrary quantum codes for ad errors for simple - to - construct recovery maps , @xcite ; * no explicit performance comparison in terms of the entanglement fidelity between additive and nonadditive quantum codes for ad errors , @xcite .    in this article ,",
    "following the working methodology advocated by one of the authors in @xcite , we seek to advance our quantitative understanding via simple analytical computations of the role played by degeneracy , self - complementarity , additivity and nonadditivity of quantum codes for the gad error model @xcite . specifically , we present the analysis of the performance of various approximate quantum error correction schemes for the gad  channel .",
    "we consider both stabilizer and nonadditive quantum codes .",
    "the performance of such error - correcting schemes is quantified by means of the entanglement fidelity as a function of the damping probability and the non - zero environmental temperature .",
    "the recovery scheme employed throughout our work applies , in principle , to arbitrary quantum codes and is the analogue of the perfect knill - laflamme recovery scheme adapted to the approximate quantum error correction framework for the gad error model .",
    "we also analytically recover and/or clarify some previously known numerical results in the limiting case of vanishing temperature of the environment .",
    "in addition , our extended analytical investigation suggests that degenerate stabilizer codes and self - complementary nonadditive codes are especially suitable for the error correction of the gad noise model .",
    "finally , comparing the properly normalized entanglement fidelities of the best performant stabilizer and nonadditive codes characterized by the same length , we show that nonadditive codes outperform stabilizer codes not only in terms of encoded dimension but also in terms of fidelity .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",

    "it can be shown that the gad qubit channel can be realized by considering the evolution of a two - level quantum system ( that is , a qubit ) in a dissipative interaction , in the born - markov rotating - wave approximation @xcite , with a bath of harmonic oscillators taken to be initially in a thermal state @xcite .",

    "however , we have tried to maintain the same degree of conservativeness in all our estimates in order to preserve the fairness of the comparisons between pairs of different quantum codes .",
    "after all , exact analytical calculations of the entanglement fidelities can be quite intimidating .",
    "they are conceptually straightforward but computationally extremely tedious if performed by hands to avoid the drawbacks of numerical results @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that conservative estimates are not uncommon in qec since , after all , we are lead to deal with approximations . for instance , conservativeness appears in analytic estimates of error thresholds in topological qec when crude combinatorics arguments are employed @xcite as well as in the numerical estimation of the error threshold to depolarization of toric codes by means of monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "* third , despite the variety of quantum codes employed in the approximate qec of gad  errors presented in this work , we emphasize that we can not state without a doubt that for any given arbitrary noise model , nonadditive and degenerate codes are more efficient , in general , than additive and nondegenerate codes . in all honesty , we feel uncomfortable in extrapolating a general statement from a large , but yet limited , number of special cases .",
    "perhaps , this is the reason why qec is an art : general statements can not be made a priori , each scenario has to be taken into consideration separately .",
    "it is a matter of finding a good matching between the noise model and the quantum code .",
    "furthermore , we are not able to quantify exactly the effect on the code performances provided by fractional encoding , a feature of nonadditive codes , or by the possibility of correcting a number of errors greater than the one that is uniquely identified , a feature of degenerate codes .",
    "also , we can not rule out the possibility that the mathematical structure behind the sign pattern that characterizes the various codewords spanning the codespaces may play a relevant role in determining the performance of the error correction schemes . in conclusion",
    ", the merit of achieving higher performances can not be ascribed to specific properties of a code , but rather to the properties of a code _ together _ with a family of errors it is designed to correct .",
    "this final remark is in excellent agreement with the fact that , for instance , degeneracy must not be regarded as a property of a quantum code alone , but rather a property of a code together with a class of errors it is designed to recover .    in conclusion",
    ", we feel we have truly challenged ourselves in this work from an analytical stand - point and we tried to advance our understanding of approximate qec of gad errors for various qubit codes , both additive and nonadditive , as much as we could . we are confident we have succeeded in this regard . however , in all fairness , it is very likely that quantitative results in qec will always require the help of numerical investigations . in future efforts , we wish to further sharpen our analytic estimations by using , if possible , both additional analytical and numerical scrutiny .",
