    "a central task of the theory of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) is to describe the consequences of this zero temperature singularity on physical properties at finite temperature since all experiments can only be done at non - zero temperature @xcite .",

    "recently , there have been intense efforts to establish a @xmath0-symmetric quantum theory as a complex extension of the conventional quantum mechanics @xcite , since the discovery that a non - hermitian hamiltonian having simultaneous parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry has a real spectrum @xcite .",
    "motivated by the pseudo - hermiticity of non - hermitian systems , the qpt in a non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric ising model , which is driven by a complex staggered transverse field , has been explored based on the exact solution @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the phase diagram can be characterized by the geometric phase .",
    "the phase boundary can be identified by a divergence of berry curvature density , which is defined in the context of biorthogonal bases .    in this paper , we address two questions concerning the quantum criticality for the non - hermitian ising model at finite temperature . at first , whether the qpt driven by complex parameters has residual criticality at finite temperature .",
