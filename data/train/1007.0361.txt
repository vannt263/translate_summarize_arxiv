    "in the chamber we have two groups of electrons belonging to cloud : primary photo - electrons generated by the synchrotron radiation photons and secondary electrons generated by the beam induced multi - pactoring . electrons in the first group generated at the beam pipe wall interact with the parent bunch and are accelerated to the velocity given by : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the classical electron radius and @xmath13 is the effective value of bunch population and @xmath14 @xmath15 ibeing the bunch spacing and @xmath16 the length of bunch .",
