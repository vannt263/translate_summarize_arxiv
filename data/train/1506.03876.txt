    "the continuous interest in inverse spectral theory @xcite has reached many important results connected with cavities , billiards and their inherent quantum chaology @xcite .",
    "apart from the purest interest of kac s question and the shape of drums , fresh applications of quantum mechanics seem to draw the attention to similar problems in different areas such as propagation in crystals .",
    "recent examples in experiments connected with the quantum behaviour of matter @xcite illustrate the important role of tight - binding lattices and their shapes .",
    "this is also true for other emulations of solids in mesoscopic physics , which sacrifice quantumness in favour of geometrical flexibility , with the aim of exploring more and more effects inexpensively @xcite .",
    "along with these examples comes the necessity of dealing with inverse spectral problems defined on lattices of any dimensionality , in particular tight - binding chains .",
    "thus , inverse lattice design can be conceived as an answer to the problem of a discrete shape producing a specific spectral feature .",
    "the incarnations of tight - binding models are of a great variety , but the focus of this paper shall be centered in waveguides , since they can be regarded as elongated variants of the more traditional drum .",
    "see figure [ fig : i.0 ] .",
    "waveguides can also be open at their ends , which makes them accessible through scattering , with slight perturbative effects in their resonating frequencies when compared with their closed counterparts .",
    "the question is , can we hear the shape of a pipe ?    in this paper we provide a general answer to the following two practical questions : is it possible to produce an arbitrary finite spectrum by the mere use of a one - dimensional chain _ without  _ local potentials ?",
    "are these results applicable to the transport properties of a scattering device ?",
    "the answers shall be delivered by characterizing the space of all tight - binding hamiltonians that produce a suitably defined spectrum , together with their plausible realization in bent waveguides operating with a well - established binding mechanism at corners @xcite .",
    "similar problems have been proposed in previous works ; notably , the system of interest has a close resemblance with quantum graphs , for which there are extensive studies @xcite . however , there are also sharp differences between our waveguides and one - dimensional wires conforming a graph . for instance",
    ", evanescent transport is possible only in the presence of a non - vanishing thickness , and it is through this mechanism that we shall establish finite difference equations . in this respect , it is important to mention that significant results in the field of graphs can be found in @xcite , relating the spectrum of a continuous one - dimensional laplacian with that of a finite difference operator defined on graph vertices .",
    "nevertheless , the design of a specific graph producing an arbitrary spectrum is rarely given in the literature .",
    "we present our discussion as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we characterize the spaces of hamiltonians for a given spectrum and we generate a set of algebraic equations that relate hopping amplitudes ( couplings ) in terms of energies as parameters .",
    "this part is of a mathematical nature and it is carefully presented . as an application , in section [ sec:3 ] we study bent waveguide realizations of tight - binding arrays .",
    "we demonstrate that exactly solvable systems of the inverse problem can be emulated by explicit design of the lattice : the dirac oscillator , the finite oscillator and partially isospectral chains are presented .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec:4 ] .     systems described in this paper : bent waveguides with multiple corners and tight - binding arrays of resonators.,width=453 ]",
    "we shall work with nearest neighbour tight - binding systems of identical sites , which belong to the wider class of jacobi matrices .",
    "we must mention that previous work such as @xcite and references therein , deals with the inverse spectral theory of such operators .",
    "although the theory has more general hypotheses related to all posible tridiagonal matrices , the claimed solution in such references rests on the assumption of two known spectra for two hamiltonians belonging to the same sequence  see corollary 2.5 in @xcite .",
    "the intertwining of levels and the specific form of the spectral function allow to determine univocally the elements of one of the hamiltonians ( either the first or second in the sequence ) .",
    "however , our inverse problem is restricted to the knowledge of only one spectrum .",
    "we shall see that this explains the existence of infinite solutions .",
    "the determination of such a space of solutions can be seen as a complementary result to the known literature .",
    "let us establish our mathematical notation : we choose units such that @xmath0 , we denote by @xmath1 the number of sites in the array and we assume that any state @xmath2 can be written as a superposition of a complete set of localized ( atomic ) states @xmath3 :     @xmath4 to be concentrated around the site located at @xmath5 ( e.g. a wannier function @xcite , but without band index for simplicity ) . since we deal with arrays of identical sites , we must have identical localized functions related by translations @xmath6 .",
    "the atomic states themselves @xmath3 can be translated by means of a unitary operator @xmath7    t |n = |n-1 , t^ |n = |n+1 . [ 1.2 ] the matrix elements of @xmath7 are clearly given by @xmath8 .",
    "we can define an observable @xmath9 associated to the site label @xmath10 with the property    n |n = n |n , n|n|m = n _ n , m . [",
    "1.3 ] for any function @xmath11 of the operator @xmath9 alone , we must have    f(n ) |n = f(n ) |n f_n |n . [ 1.4 ] the stationary schrdinger equation corresponding to nearest neighbour chains with variable couplings but without local potentials is thus    h |_k",
    "= e_k |_k = |_k , 1 k n+1 , [ 1.5 ] where now @xmath12 encodes the information on the variable couplings , according to their location in the chain .",
    "in fact , ( [ 1.5 ] ) can be written as a recurrence if we set        e_k _",
    "_ n+1^k + f_n-1^ * _ n-1^k , 1 k n+1 , 1 n n+1 . [ 1.7 ] since the system is finite , the previous relation is supplemented with fictitious boundary conditions @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , the couplings to fictitious sites must vanish @xmath14 .    with these conditions ,",
    "the physical block of the system is determined by the non - vanishing elements of the operator @xmath12 .",
    "since we are interested in completely connected chains , we impose @xmath15 for @xmath16 , but it is important to stress that @xmath17 can be arbitrarily large .    a few results can be established already : the spectrum @xmath18  with @xmath19 as in ( [ 1.5]) is not quite arbitrary .    if @xmath20 , then @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath18 is symmetrical around the origin .",
    "to prove this assertion , we multiply by @xmath22 both sides of ( [ 1.7 ] ) and define @xmath23 , leading to    - e_k _ n^k = f_n _ n+1^k + f_n-1^ * _ n-1^k , [ 1.8 ] which implies that @xmath24 is an eigenstate of @xmath19 with eigenvalue @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "a simple corollary of this result is that for @xmath17 even , @xmath27 , i.e. at least one @xmath28 should vanish .",
    "another result of interest here is the nature of wavefunctions in connection with couplings .",
    "let @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 .    the proof is given by a gauge transformation when @xmath32 is allowed to be complex .",
    "if we set @xmath33 , @xmath34 and multiply both sides of ( [ 1.7 ] ) by @xmath35 , we find    e_k ( e^i _ n_n^k ) = f_n ( e^i _ n+1 _ n+1^k ) + f_n-1^ * ( e^i _ n-1_n-1^k ) . [ 1.9 ] from this relation it follows that the new state     hamiltonian @xmath36 @xmath26 .    therefore , without loss of generality , we can work with real and positive couplings @xmath32 in one - dimensional systems without loops .",
    "although we are not concerned now with a non - trivial topology of the chain , it is worth mentioning that the influence of magnetic fields would destroy ( [ 1.9 ] ) .    in passing ,",
    "we note that in certain applications related to transmission of information along chains ( e.g. bosonic or fermionic matter in optical lattices @xcite ) one needs a second - quantization scheme .",
    "the formalism previously developed can be generalized easily to such situations : the local - field replacements @xmath37 , @xmath38 , with canonical relations @xmath39=\\delta_{n , m}$ ] or @xmath40 lead to spectral problems similar to ( [ 1.7 ] ) .",
    "returning to our problem as stated in ( [ 1.5 ] ) , we recognize that @xmath19 can be identified with the position operator @xmath41 of an @xmath42- or @xmath43- deformed oscillator ( e.g. deformations of heisenberg algebras _  la  _ manko @xcite ) .",
    "this type of quantum optical application requires an operator @xmath44 representing the occupation number of photons at a given frequency , i.e. a normal mode in a cavity .",
    "what we note from this connection is that indeed , position operators have symmetric spectra about the origin and that eigenvalues can be distributed either continuously , discretely , in bounded regions , in closed intervals , or in the whole real line .",
    "finally , the inverse spectral problems that we tackle in this paper must be fed is known from the outset .",
    "we touch upon this case in other sections.]with the following information :    * a symmetric , but otherwise arbitrary set @xmath18 , * a set of real coupling constants @xmath32 , * an arbitrary but fixed size @xmath1 .    with this in mind",
    ", we characterize the spaces of solutions in what follows .      in this section",
    "we determine the space @xmath45 of all possible nearest - neighbour hamiltonians that lead to the same spectrum - complying , of course , with the requirements of the previous section .",
    "we shall see that such spaces can be characterized by orbits generated by linear operators , which however do not correspond to the whole space of @xmath46 unitary matrices due to the nearest - neighbour restriction .",
    "we shall see as well that the gauge transformations defined by ( [ 1.10 ] ) are but a trivial part of @xmath45 . for a positive integer @xmath10 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath47 the group of unitary @xmath48 matrices and let us define @xmath49 .",
    "then , for a fixed @xmath18 we have an equivalence class @xmath50 containing @xmath19 such that    ^n+1 _ h u_h ( n+1 ) [ 1.11 ] where the contentions are proper except for @xmath51 or vanishing couplings . the process by which we shall work consists in the introduction of two auxiliary operators @xmath52 and",
    "@xmath41 ; @xmath52 encodes the information of the couplings and @xmath41 connects all the hamiltonians isospectral to the homogeneous chain .",

    "we must note that @xmath41 could be non - unitary , which renders a solution space beyond the set of all symmetries of the periodic chain .",
    "we also note that the validity of ( [ 1.20 ] ) is restricted to the physical @xmath1 dimensional block , which is more conveniently described by @xmath1 dimensional projectors @xmath63 as follows :    x p ( t+t^ ) p^ x^ = p ( t+t^ ) p^.

    "this is shown in figures [ fig:1.3](a ) and ( b ) ; in ( b ) we find indeed a peak at @xmath134 as the most problable value ( i.e. the periodic case ) , accompanied by a nonvanishing width that reveals the existence of other systems with the same spectrum ( note however that the eigenfunctions do not coincide ) .",
    "the average and deviation are @xmath135 and @xmath136 respectively .",
    "the second example gives a distribution of couplings ( see histograms in figures [ fig:1.3](c ) and ( d ) ) with a decay faster than exponential .",
    "this is natural , given the fact that the spectral span is roughly the width @xmath137 of the gaussian in ( c ) , and the maximum coupling of the system must be constrained also by a gaussian band , i.e. the coupling distribution and the energy distribution have a similar asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the average of the coupling distribution is @xmath138 .",
    "we also find that the most probable value of the coupling is @xmath139 and it is considerably greater than zero ( here @xmath140 ) ; this is explained by noting that nonzero couplings may give rise to zero or close to zero energy eigenvalues .",
    "thus , if the spectral distribution is dominated by the centre of a band , we obtain matrix elements of @xmath19 that are predominantly _ displaced  _ from the centre , as shown in figure [ fig:1.3](d ) .",
    "we test our tight - binding models with a physical system that provides the required flexibility .",
    "adjustable couplings , as well as the existence of evanescent modes draw our attention to systems of waveguides with several bendings .",
    "such realizations are indeed susceptible of manipulations that produce partial isospectrality : we should bear in mind that the dirichlet boundary value problem posed by bent waveguides leads to nontrivial behavior at high energies or frequencies , connecting the problem with wave - like manifestations of chaos @xcite .",
    "however , at very low energies we can take advantage of trapped states at corners @xcite ( in fact , only one bound state at a right bending angle ) , providing an exponentially evanescent coupling of two corners as a function of the distance between them .",
    "the idea then is to accomodate as many levels as necessary below the propagation threshold of the guide ; this is done by adjusting the distances between the corners contained in the array .",
    "see figures [ fig : i.0 ] , [ fig:1.4 ] and [ fig:1.4.1 ] . in this way we engineer the necessary couplings for a given spectrum and",
    "finally tame the beast .",
    "it is important to mention that , from the physical point of view , some realizations put restrictions on the width of waveguides @xcite .",
    "our realizations are of a different nature , and the existence of bound states in corners is independent of the scale .",
    "in fact , they have been confirmed experimentally even with microwaves @xcite .",
    "this can be easily explained by noting that the classical theorems found by exner and seba rely on the smoothness of the waveguide  in contrast to our case as well as the independent variation of width and curvature .",
    "quoting their result , `` a bound state with energy below the first transversal mode exists for all sufficiently small @xmath141 '' , which ensures the existence of a trapped mode for a certain range of the width and `` the proof ... establishes existence of the critical width @xmath142 ... '' .",
    "in addition , goldstone and jaffe ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) proved by a variational method the existence of bound states for all widths in twisted tubes of _",
    "constant  _ section .",
    "right - angle bends , on the other hand , have infinite curvature at the corner and do not have constant section . for a single corner , one is convinced that increasing the separation distance between boundaries amounts to a global scaling of the system  see the explanation below ( 7 ) in @xcite . in connection with scaling properties in the limit of vanishing width , some works have shown the persistence of evanescent modes in effectively one - dimensional wires @xcite , but here we provide an explicit dependence of the evanescence length in terms of the geometry .",
    "the equation to solve here is of the helmholtz type ( a quantum particle trapped in the cavity or te modes in a good conductor ) :    ( x , y ) = 0 , ( x , y ) = 0 ( x , y ) . [",
    "3.1 ] the associated hamiltonian for this equation is simply @xmath143 . for two adjacent corners 1 and 2 , we find the coupling @xmath11 by means of an overlap between trapped modes    f = _ _ 1(x , y ) h",
    "_ 2(x , y ) dxdy , [ 3.2 ] giving rise to the following block representation of a two - corner system at very low energies :    h _ e = (    cc e_b & f + f & e_b    ) .",
    "[ 3.3 ] here , @xmath144 is the energy of a trapped mode in an isolated corner .",
    "numerical calculations show that for an infinite guide @xmath145 @xcite , that is , a fraction of the propagation threshold @xmath146 if the straight segment has a width @xmath147 .",
    "it has been shown theoretically and experimentally @xcite that such trapped modes have exponentially vanishing tails as functions of the distance @xmath141 from the corner , measured along a straight segment .",
    "we write @xmath148 with @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath11 can be written to a very good approximation as    f ( d ) = ( 0 ) ( - ) . [ 3.4 ] we have verified this law numerically for a system of two corners in different configurations , the results are shown in figures [ fig:1.4 ] and [ fig:1.4.1 ] .",
    "this is also in agreement with the classic results by carini and co workers @xcite .    with these considerations we justify the applicability of tight - binding models for the description of spectra and wave functions of more intricate systems of waveguides .",
    "we also perform numerical computations of the 2d problem for each realization , in order to give a fair comparison with our predictions . +     numerical results for the decay of energy splittings as a function of distance @xmath141 in units of width @xmath147 .",
    "the close agreement with the red curve is a clear indicative of exponentially vanishing couplings ; the parameters are @xmath150 , @xmath151 .",
    "this has been computed for u and s configurations shown in figure [ fig:1.4.1].,width=264 ]     symmetric and antisymmetric states for s and u waveguides .",

    "the incarnation using microwave resonators provided a natural way to adjust couplings by varying distances between dielectric disks .",
