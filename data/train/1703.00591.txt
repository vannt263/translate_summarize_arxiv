    "how much does @xmath4 differ from the block diagonalizer @xmath1 of @xmath21 ?",
    "there are two important aspects that needs clarification regarding this perturbation problem .",
    "first , @xmath65 may or may not be @xmath10-block diagonalizable .",
    "although allowing this counters the common sense that one can only gauge the difference between diagonalizers that exist , it is for a good reason and important practically to allow this . as we argued above , a generic  is usually not block diagonalizable , and thus even if the  for @xmath21 has a diagonalizer , its arbitrarily perturbed",
    "problem is potentially not block diagonalizable no matter how tiny the perturbation may be .",
    "this leads to an impossible task : to compare the block diagonalizer @xmath1 of the unperturbed @xmath21 , that does exist , to a diagonalizer @xmath67 of the perturbed matrix set @xmath65 , that may not exist .",
    "we get around this dilemma by talking about an approximate diagonalizer of @xmath65 , that always exist .",
    "it turns out this workaround is exactly what some practical applications calls for because most practical  come from block diagonalizable  but contaminated with noises to become approximately block diagonalizable and an approximate diagonalizer for the noisy   gets computed numerically .",
    "in such a scenario , it is important to get a sense as how far the computed diagonalizer is from the exact diagonalizer of the clean albeit unknown , had the noises not presented .",
    "the second aspect is about what metric to use in order to measure the difference between two block diagonalizers , given that they are not unique . in view of definition  [ dfn : us - jbdp ] and the discussion in the paragraph immediately proceeding it , we propose to use @xmath68 for the purpose , where @xmath69 is some matrix norm .",
    "usually which norm to use is determined by the convenience of any particular analysis , but for all practical purpose , any norm is just as good as another . in our theoretical analysis below , we use both @xmath70 , the matrix spectral norm , and @xmath71 , the matrix frobenius norm @xcite , but use only @xmath71 in our numerical tests because then is computable . additionally , in using , we usually restrict @xmath1 and @xmath4 to @xmath72 .",
    "mica @xcite aims at separating linearly mixed unknown sources into statistically independent groups of signals .",
    "a basic mica model can be stated as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the observed mixture , @xmath75 is a nonsingular matrix ( often called _ the mixing matrix _ ) , @xmath76 is the source signal , and @xmath77 is the noise vector .",
    "we would like to recover the source @xmath78 from the observed mixture @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath80^{\\operatorname{t}}$ ] with @xmath81 for @xmath82 , and @xmath83^{\\operatorname{t}}$ ] .",
    "assume that all @xmath84 are independent of each other , and each @xmath84 has mean @xmath52 and contains no lower - dimensional independent component , and among all @xmath84 , there exists at most one gaussian component .",
    "assume further that the noises @xmath85 are real stationary white random signals , mutually uncorrelated with the same variance @xmath86 , and independent of the sources . to recover the source signal @xmath78 , it suffices to find @xmath87 or its inverse from the observed mixture @xmath79 .",
    "notice that if @xmath87 is a solution , then so is @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a block diagonal scaling matrix and @xmath37 is a block - wise permutation matrix . in this sense , there is certain degree of freedom in the determination of @xmath87 .",
    "such indeterminacy of the solution is natural , and does not matter in applications .",
    "we have the following statements .    1",
    ".   the covariance matrix @xmath90 of @xmath79 satisfies @xmath91 where @xmath92 stands for the mathematical expectation , and @xmath93 is the covariance matrix of @xmath78 . by the above assumptions , we know that @xmath94 .",
    "assume that @xmath95 is accurately estimated as @xmath96 .",
    "then we have @xmath97 in particular , in the absence of noises , i.e. , @xmath98 , becomes an equality .",
    "2 .   the kurtosis @xmath99 of @xmath79 is a tensor of dimension @xmath100 .",
    "fixing two indices , say the first two , and varying the last two , we have @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the kurtosis of @xmath78 and it can be shown that @xmath103 .    together , they result in a   for @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 is an exact @xmath10-block diagonalizer when no noise is presented .",
    "when we attempt to block - diagonalize @xmath65 , all we can do is to calculate an approximation @xmath67 of @xmath106 for some @xmath34 and @xmath41 , which corresponds to the indeterminacy of mica ( even in the case when @xmath98 , i.e. , there is no noise ) .",
    "the point we try to make from this case study is that , in practical applications , due to measurement errors , we only get to work with @xmath107 that are , in general , only approximately block diagonalizable and , in the end , an approximate block diagonalizer @xmath4 of @xmath65 gets computed . in the other word , we usually do nt have @xmath21 which is known block diagonalizable in theory but what we do have is @xmath65 which may or may not be block diagonalizable and for which we have an approximate block diagonalizer @xmath4 . then how far this @xmath4 is from the exact diagonalizer @xmath1 of @xmath21 becomes a central question , in order to gauge the quality of @xmath4 .",
    "this is what we set out to do in this paper .",
    "our result is an upper bound on the measure in .",
    "such an upper bound will also help us understand what are the inherent factors that affect the sensitivity of .",
    "though tremendous efforts have gone to solve / , their perturbation problems had received little or no attention in the past .",
    "in fact , today there are only a handful articles written on the perturbations of  only . for",
    ", cardoso @xcite presented a first order perturbation bound for a set of commuting matrices , and the result was later generalized by russo @xcite . for general , using gradient flows , afsari @xcite studied sensitivity via cost functions and obtained first order perturbation bounds for the diagonalizer .",
    "shi and cai @xcite investigated a normalized   through a constrained optimization problem , and obtained an upper bound on certain distance between an approximate diagonalizer of a perturbed optimization problem and an exact diagonalizer of the unperturbed optimization problem .     can also be regarded as a particular case of the _ block term decomposition _ ( btd ) of third order tensors @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness conditions of tensor decompositions , which is strongly connected to the sensitivity of tensor decompositions , received much attention recently ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , perturbation theory for tensor decompositions , often referred to as _ identifiability of tensors _ , up to now , is only discussed for the so - called _ canonical polyadic decomposition _ ( cpd )",
    "( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "perturbation theories for other models of tensor decompositions , e.g. , the tucker decomposition and btd , have not been touched yet .",
    "more work is obviously needed in this area .      a biggest reason as to why no available perturbation analysis for   is , perhaps , due to lacking perfect ways to uniquely describe block diagonalizers , not to mention no available uniqueness condition to nail them down , unlike many other matrix perturbation problems surveyed in @xcite .",
    "quite recently , in the sense of definition  [ dfn : us - jbdp ] , cai and liu @xcite established necessary and sufficient conditions for a  to be uniquely block diagonalizable .",
    "these conditions are the cornerstone for our current investigation in this paper .",
    "unlike the results in existing literatures , the result in this paper does not involve any cost function , which makes it widely applicable to any approximate diagonalizer computed from min / maximizing a cost function .",
    "the result also reveals the inherent factors that affect the sensitivity of .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : uniq ] , we discuss properties of a uniquely block diagonalizable  and introduce the concepts of the moduli of uniqueness and non - divisibility that play key roles in our later development .",

    "secondly , it is general enough to cover the case when the  for @xmath65 is actually @xmath10-block diagonalizable .",

    "theorem  [ thm : main ] , as a perturbation theorem for , can be used to yield an error bound for an approximate block diagonalizer of block diagonalizable @xmath21 by simply letting all @xmath318 , i.e. , @xmath319 .",
