    "recently the star collaboration announced @xcite the results on possible local parity violation in heavy ion collisions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that in the hot dense matter created in heavy ion collisions local , instanton or sphaleron , transitions to qcd vacua with different topological charge may result in metastable domains , where parity is locally violated .    in this paper",
    "we will solely concentrate on an analysis of the experimental results .",
    "we will neither attempt to provide alternative explanations for the observed correlations , such as e.g. given in ref .",
    "@xcite nor will we discuss the likelihood that the proposed effect may occur in a heavy ion collision .",
    "for detailed discussion of the underlying mechanism and the latest theoretical review of this problem we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the phenomenon due to local parity violation , which is of relevance for the discussion here , is the so called chiral magnetic effect @xcite .",
    "it leads to the separation of negatively and positively charged particles along the system s angular momentum ( or equivalently the direction of the magnetic field ) into two hemispheres separated by the reaction plane . as a result",
    ", the system exhibits a electric current along the direction of the angular momentum , and thus breaks parity locally in a given event .",
    "however , since instanton ( sphaleron ) and anti - instanton ( anti - sphaleron ) transitions occur equally likely , the chiral magnetic current is either aligned or anti - aligned with the angular momentum . as a result , the expectation value of any parity odd observable , such as @xmath1 vanishes . here",
    "@xmath2 is the chiral - magnetic current and @xmath3 is the angular momentum .",
    "consequently , a direct measurement of parity violation even in a small subsystem is impossible .",
    "however , one may attempt to identify the existence of these parity violation domains by studying the fluctuations or the variance of a parity - odd observable . since the variance of a parity - odd observable is parity even , in principle other , genuinely parity - even , effects may contribute , and one needs to separate those carefully before being able to draw any conclusions about the existence of local , parity violating domains .    in ref .",
    "@xcite voloshin proposed a method to measure the variance of a parity odd observables .",
    "he suggested to measure the following correlator @xmath4 , where @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the azimuthal angles of the reaction plane and produced charged particles respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig_rplain ] .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the azimuthal angles of the reaction plane and produced charged particles , respectively . ]    as we will discuss in more detail in section [ sec : integrated ] this rather involved correlation function has the advantage that correlations which are independent of the reaction plane do not contribute . as a result , a large fraction of the expected background should cancel .",
    "recently the star collaboration has reported the measurement of the above correlation function @xcite , both integrated over the entire acceptance as well as differential in transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in",
    "the following section we will analyze the integrated star result and will suggest additional measurements necessary to further clarify the situation .",
    "in the subsequent section , we will concentrate on the @xmath0 differential results and explore to which extend they are consistent with the expected soft phenomena due to the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "in ref . @xcite the details of the star measurement are given . among other things star",
    "shows the results for @xmath10 and for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the azimuthal angles of the produced charged particles .",
    "the paper gives reasonable arguments that@xmath13where @xmath14 is the angle of the reaction plane , and @xmath15 characterizes the elliptic anisotropy for the particle with angle @xmath16 .",
    "for the rest of the discussion we will assume that the relation ( [ react_plane ] ) is correct .",
    "as a consequence , we will work in a frame where the reaction plane is defined by the @xmath17 coordinates and where the @xmath18 direction is perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "in other word we work in a frame where @xmath19 , see fig .",
    "[ fig_rplain ] .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath20 is independent of the direction of the reaction plane-[\\phi _ { \\beta } -\\psi _ { rp}])\\right\\rangle $ ] ] , it will be the same also in the frame where the reaction plane is specified e.g. , @xmath19 .",
    "thus within our frame we have to consider the following two - particle correlations:@xmath21    star has measured both these correlation functions for same sign , @xmath22 , and opposite sign , @xmath23 , pairs of charged particles . qualitatively the data for @xmath24 collisions can be characterized as follows .",
    "* for same sign pairs:@xmath25using eq .",
    "( [ math ] ) this implies@xmath26 * for opposite sign pairs we find that@xmath27 + again , using eq .",
    "( [ math ] ) , this means@xmath28    the actual data decomposed into the above components are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sscc ] .     and out of plane @xmath29 for same and opposite charge pairs in @xmath24 collisions .",
    "as can be seen the correlations for same charge pairs are mainly in - plane.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and out of plane @xmath29 for same and opposite charge pairs in @xmath24 collisions . as can be seen the correlations for same charge pairs are mainly in - plane.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the fact that for same charge pairs the sinus - term in eq .",
    "( [ ss0 ] ) ( see fig . [ fig_sscc ] ) is essentially zero whereas the cosine term is finite , tells us that the observed correlations are actually _ in plane _ rather than out of plane .",
    "this is contrary to the expectation from the chiral magnetic effect , which results in same charge correlation out of plane .",
    "in addition , since the cosine term is negative , the in - plane correlations are stronger for back - to - back pairs than for small angle pairs .",
    "second , we see that for opposite charge pairs the in- and out - of - plane correlations are virtually identical .",
    "this is hard to comprehend , given that there is a sizable elliptic flow in these collisions .",
    "at present , there is no simple explanation for neither of these observations .",
    "however , they may be explained by a cluster model , which requires several , not unreasonable , assumptions @xcite .",
    "one may ask if there is room for a parity violating component if for the same sign @xmath30 , i.e. the signal is in - plane rather than out of plane . following the argument of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can always write@xmath31where @xmath32 is the part of the correlation which is caused be the parity violation ( at this stage we do not claim that @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 represents all other contributions by correlations projected on the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane . denoting the correlations in - plane @xmath35 by @xmath36 we obtain:@xmath37-p ,   \\notag \\\\",
    "\\left\\langle \\cos ( \\phi _ { \\alpha } -\\phi _ { \\beta } ) \\right\\rangle _ { same } & = & [ b_{in}+b_{out}]+p.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the advantage of @xmath38 is obvious .",
    "the background is @xmath39 , meaning that all correlations that do not depend on the reaction plane orientation cancel .",
    "the star collaboration studied many known sources of reaction plane dependent correlations and all effects produce @xmath39 which is much smaller than the observed signal .",
    "we note , however , that at present the background is not understood since none of the present models is able to explain the value of @xmath40 .    following the above argument",
    ", however , immediately implies that ( using eq .",
    "( [ ss0 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) ) @xmath41i.e .",
    ", the parity violating effect has to be precisely of the same magnitude as all other , standard correlations .",
    "this relation is quite an unexpected coincidence .",
    "it means that the parity signal is quite strong , and consequently should also be visible in @xmath42 if the background is well understood .    in our view , it is mandatory to explore if the relation , eq .",
    "( [ end ] ) , is just a coincidence or an indication of potential problems with the present interpretation of the data . to answer this question it is essential to analyze the correlation function @xmath43 differentially in transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity as it has been already done for @xmath44",
    ". should relation ( [ end ] ) persist also for the differential correlations , one would have to conclude that the proposed parity violating effect is not seen in the data .",
    "the star collaboration has also presented @xcite the measurement of @xmath45 in mid - central @xmath24 collisions as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the absolute values of the particles momenta .",
    "qualitatively the data can be characterized as follows .",
    "dependence of the signal , not in the overall normalization . ]    * for same sign pairs in the range @xmath50 gev:@xmath51 * for opposite sign pairs the signal vs @xmath52 and @xmath53 is consistent with zero .",
    "one would expect @xcite that the parity violating signal should be a soft , low @xmath54 phenomenon .",
    "thus the observed increase of the signal for same sign pairs with @xmath52 seems to be inconsistent with the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "as we will show such a conclusion is not necessarily correct and the true signal may indeed be consistent with the expected low @xmath0 dynamics .    indeed , by definition@xmath55where @xmath56 is the number of correlated pairs [ via @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the number of all pairs .",
    "the latter can be easily approximated by [ @xmath46 and @xmath59:@xmath60\\right )   \\notag \\\\ & \\propto & p_{+}^{3}e^{-2p_{+}/t }   \\label{all - sum}\\end{aligned}\\]]and@xmath61where in the following calculations we take @xmath62 gev .",
    "gev . ]    the calculated distributions of all pairs vs @xmath63 and @xmath64 are presented in fig .",
    "it is worth noticing that both functions are concentrated in the small @xmath54 region , reflecting typical thermal distributions for @xmath53 and @xmath52 . due to the soft nature of chiral magnetic effect",
    ", one expects that the distributions in @xmath53 and @xmath52 for the correlated particles should not differ much from the underlying thermal distributions .",
    "this is indeed the case as we will demonstrate next .     and",
    "@xmath65 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath65 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to estimate the distribution of correlated same sign pairs it is sufficient to multiply eq .",
    "( [ data - pt ] ) by the expressions ( all - sum ) and ( [ all - dif ] ) , respectively .",
    "consequently we obtain @xmath66    as can be seen the dependence of the number of correlated same pairs vs @xmath64 is identical to the dependence of all pairs presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_pairs ] .",
    "clearly the signal is concentrated in the low @xmath54 region and indeed is unchanged from a thermal distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig_boost ] the dependence of the number of same sign pairs vs @xmath67 is compared with the dependence of all pairs ( previously shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pairs ] ) .",
    "we find that the momenta of correlated particles are slightly shifted to the higher @xmath54 and the shape is roughly similar .",
    "the momentum shift required by the data is @xmath68 which could conceivably be due to the large magnetic field , although it is somewhat on the high end of what one would naively expect from electromagnetic phenomena .",
    "in this note we have discussed several aspects of the recent measurement of possible local parity violation in @xmath24 collisions by the star collaboration .",
    "we made the following three observations :    \\(i ) for particles with the same charge star sees large negative correlations in - plain @xmath69 and very small correlations out of plain @xmath70 .",
    "for opposite sign correlations in - plane and out - plain are both positive and of the same magnitude .",

    "trivial correlations projected on the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "this may be a pure coincidence or an indication that the present interpretation of the data as a signal for local parity violation needs to be revised . to investigate this problem in more detail we need differential distribution ( vs pseudo - rapidity or transverse momenta ) of @xmath71 and @xmath72 at the same time .",
    "\\(iii ) we have also argued that the distribution of the number of correlated pairs is concentrated in the low @xmath54 region i.e. @xmath73 gev .",
    "it is not inconsistent with the predictions of the chiral magnetic effect .    at present",
