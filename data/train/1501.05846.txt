    "the advent of the `` high resolution '' ( @xmath2 ) capability of the x - ray transmission grating spectrometers on the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory opened up further possible means of probing coronal structure .",
    "one of these is through the doppler shifts of spectral lines in the x - ray emitting plasma that arise as a result of orbital or rotational motion .    for late - type stars ,",
    "the velocities involved are typically of order 10 - 100  km  s@xmath3easily sufficient for optical studies of rotationally - driven changes in spectral line profiles that are now routinely `` inverted '' to make quite detailed doppler images of surface features of varying brightness ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and zeeman doppler images of surface magnetic features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , for instruments with a resolving power of @xmath4 , such velocities only amount to a fraction of the instrumental width , and doppler studies are challenging .",
    "nevertheless , several studies have now demonstrated the utility of _ chandra _ low- and high - energy transmission grating ( letg , hetg ) spectra for probing both orbital velocities and rotationally modulated doppler shifts in magnetically active stellar systems , both binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the excess broadening implied that a significant component of the corona at temperatures less than @xmath5  k has a scale height of order the stellar radius . a similar line width analysis",
    "applied to the rapidly rotating giant fk  com by @xcite revealed doppler shifts consistent with localized emission on one hemisphere with a scale height of about a stellar radius .    the young k - type dwarf ab doradus , with a projected rotational velocity of 90 - 100  km  s@xmath3 @xcite , presents a plausible , though challenging , case for doppler inference of coronal structure based on _ chandra _ spectra .",

    "ab  dor was observed using the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) and acis - s detector on 1999 october 9 ut11:21 for a total net exposure of 52.3ks , or approximately 1.2 stellar rotation periods .",

    "the final extracted spectrum showing the spectral lines used in this analysis is illustrated in figure  [ f : spec ] .",
    "our analysis methods described below , involving light curves , cross - correlation techniques and line profile modeling , are similar to those described by @xcite and @xcite , to which the reader seeking more detail is referred .      prior",
    "to performing detailed spectral analysis , the _ dispersed _ photon events were first examined to ascertain the level at which ab  dor varied in x - rays during the observation .",
    "owing to the acis - s 3.2s frame time , 0th order events are significantly affected by photon pile - up and do not yield accurate photometry and are ignored here .",
    "flares and rotational modulation caused by dominant active regions are of particular interest since the location of their x - ray source might be betrayed by rotationally - induced doppler shifts , providing direct observational clues as to the locations of coronal activity .",
    "the x - ray light curve obtained from both heg and meg dispersed events binned at 100s intervals is illustrated in figure  [ f : lc ] .",
    "we also show in this figure the rotational `` phase '' computed according to the ephemeris of @xcite , @xmath30 .",
    "there are several very small flare - like brightenings visible , but the light curve is dominated by a moderate flare occurring midway through the observation .",
    "there is no obvious impulsive phase and the apparent flare rise time is of order 2000s , which might be considered long for a flare of this size whose decay timescale is of order 10000s .",
    "it is possible that an impulsive phase was occulted by the stellar disk just prior to rotating into view , though doppler shift measurements discussed below suggest this might not be the case .    while the light curve does not appear to show any structure that might be commensurate with rotational modulation , the relatively short duration of the observation covering only slightly more than a single phase , combined with the flare , does hinder our ability to detect such modulation if it were present .",
    "the flatness of light curve outside of the large and smaller flares indicates that the amplitude of any rotational modulation can only be of the order of 10%   or less .      as noted above ,",
    "doppler shifts of spectral lines as a function of time might betray the presence of particularly dominant coronal structures .",
    "the equatorial velocity of ab  dor is about 95  km  s@xmath3 , which amounts to approximately 25%  of the width of the o  viii 18.97    ly@xmath31 doublet as seen by the meg ; such a shift should be easily detectable in the brighter spectral lines of the ab  dor soft x - ray spectrum .      in the first part of our analysis we searched for doppler shifts of individual spectral lines as a function of time .",
    "lines used in this analysis are listed in table  [ t : lines ] .",
    "these represent the strongest lines in the hetg spectrum of ab  dor longward of 8   . while h - like and he - like lines of si are also reasonably bright , the resolving power of the chandra gratings is generally too low at these wavelengths to be of significant additional value in this line - by - line part of the study .",

    "@xcite idl software routine fitlines .",
    "uncertainties at the @xmath39 level were determined from a thorough search of the goodness - of - fit surface .",
    "since the hetg observation covered slightly more than one full rotation period , we determined line positions in the individual time - filtered bins relative to the wavelengths measured for the same lines from the entire observation . in this way",
    ", we avoid complications from small wavelength calibration errors or any long - term drift in the dispersion relation .",
    "the measured relative line positions as a function of time are illustrated in figure  [ f : orbit_all ] .",
    "the resulting line positions are fairly stable with little change as a function of orbital phase .",
    "there is a suggestion of a redshift at phase @xmath40 in fe  xvii  @xmath41 and mg  xii  @xmath42 , but this signature is not seen in other lines .",
    "the o  viii  @xmath43 line also shows some evidence for a secular trend with a single point near @xmath44 exhibiting a @xmath45 variation from the zero level , but this trend is opposite that which one might be tempted to see in o  viii  @xmath46 ; the latter is actually perfectly consistent with a zero net velocity shift .",
    "in addition to measuring individual emission lines , we also utilized a cross - correlation technique to obtain doppler shifts as a function of rotational phase .",
    "the method involves comparison of the spectra extracted for the different time bins with a reference spectrum in order to determine whether or not there is a net doppler shift between the two .",
    "this technique was first developed during earlier analyses of _ chandra _ hetgs observations of algol @xcite and fk  com @xcite , and we refer the reader to those works for a more detailed description .",
    "the advantage of this type of cross - correlation technique over the analysis of individual spectral lines is that it utilizes the signal from the whole spectrum ",
    "strong and weaker lines , isolated and blended  and is therefore , at least in principle , much more sensitive .",
    "there are about 12 strong lines longward of 10    in the meg that have the highest velocity sensitivity and will provide the greater part of the signal , and a similar number in the heg spectrum , although , again , all features in the spectrum contribute .",
    "the disadvantage of the technique is that it potentially confuses structures with different characteristic temperatures since it uses lines formed over a fairly large temperature interval.we return to this in ",
    "[ s : disc_results ] .",
    "events were binned into five time intervals corresponding to different rotational phases , and spectra were extracted for each phase bin .",
    "these spectra were then cross - correlated with the reference spectrum , which in this case was the spectrum extracted from the entire exposure , in order to determine the velocity shift at which our correlation signal ( represented by a @xmath47 statistic ) was minimized . as in the analysis of algol , the uncertainties in this procedure were estimated using a monte carlo technique in which the analysis was repeated a number of times for different poisson realizations of the spectra .",
    "the analysis was undertaken for both the heg and meg spectra separately .",
    "the full range of each spectrum that contained significant signal was used .",
    "these ranges were 226    and 218    for meg and heg , respectively .",
    "figure  [ f : crosscor ] illustrates the line - of - sight velocity of ab  dor as a function of rotational phase obtained from the cross - correlation method , for the meg ( upper ) and heg ( lower ) data .",
    "there are clearly no large velocity shifts detected , with the more sensitive , by virtue of the number of photon counts , meg data placing quite stringent limits on average net velocity excursions of less than about 20  km  s@xmath3 . in the context of the projected surface equatorial rotational velocity of 95  km  s@xmath3",
    ", this lack of obvious systematic doppler shifts indicates that the corona of ab  dor is not dominated by one or two low - latitude active regions ; the x - ray emission must be more evenly distributed over the surface , or else resides predominantly toward polar regions for which projected rotation velocities are small .",
    "the two scenarios mentioned above can in principle be diagnosed by examining spectral line widths to search for excess rotation - related broadening . in our analysis , we compared line widths of observed data to those of model profiles , which include the effects of thermal , rotational , and instrumental broadening .",
    "the procedure was again developed from that originally discussed in detail by @xcite and @xcite .    in order to minimize uncertainties in the calibration of the instrument line response function",
    ", we carried out the ab  dor line width analysis relative to an evolved star @xmath48  vel , which is known to have a very small projected rotation velocity of @xmath49  km  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "synthetic line profiles were calculated for @xmath48  vel based on the dem obtained from the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum by @xcite .",
    "lines used in this analysis are listed in table  [ t : lines ] . the mg  xii  @xmath42 line was excluded in the line width analysis because the dispersion at this wavelength is insufficient to clearly discriminate between line widths of theoretical profiles with no rotational broadening versus those broadened by surface rotation .",
    "theoretical line profiles were synthesized by convolving the thermal , rotational , and instrumental line broadening components .",
    "details of theoretical line synthesis may be found in @xcite .",
    "thermal broadening was computed using the differential emission measure as a function of temperature , @xmath50 , derived from the same hetg spectra by @xcite . for rotational broadening",
    "we assumed solid body rotation of the stellar surface ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to the projected rotational velocity @xmath51  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the stellar radius , @xmath19 , was taken to be @xmath52 , which is consistent with the interferometric result @xmath53 of @xcite .",
    "we also synthesized profiles for different effective radii to simulate the effects of rotation of a corona with a scale height significantly above the stellar surface .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "observed line widths were measured as described in  [ s : doppler ] .",
    "table  [ t : widths ] lists the line widths of ab  dor and @xmath48  vel for observed and model profiles , together with the ab  dor excess widths relative to @xmath48  vel .",
    "we also illustrate the ab  dor excess line widths in figure  [ f : order_comp ] .",
    "the uncertainties for these excess line widths relative to @xmath48  vel correspond to the quadrature propagation of the uncertainties of the individual ab  dor and @xmath48  vel line widths . also shown",
    "are the theoretical line widths corresponding to the case of no rotation , rotation at the stellar surface , and rotation at one stellar radius above the stellar surface , all relative to @xmath48  vel .",
    "here , we define the scale height as the height above the stellar surface .",
    "note that , under this definition , negative scale heights are possible and correspond to the case where rotational broadening is less than that induced by rotation of uniform surface emission .",
    "in most cases the observed line widths in figure  [ f : order_comp ] are consistent with the theoretical profiles corresponding to zero rotation , within observational errors .",
    "most of the lines are also consistent , within errors , with theoretical profiles that include rotational broadening at the stellar surface . in order to determine to what extent",
    "the observations of individual lines can constrain the scale height of the emission of ab  dor , we combined the individual results in the following way .",
    "for each ab  dor line width we subtracted the appropriate @xmath48  vel line width , then generated 100 monte carlo realizations within a normal distribution corresponding to the observed ab  dor line width ( relative to @xmath48  vel ) and @xmath0 uncertainty .",
    "line width realizations were interpolated onto a model curve that describes the line width as a function of scale height , to obtain a distribution of scale heights for each line .",
    "finally , we computed the error weighted mean of these distributions , which is shown in figure  [ f : height ] .",
    "the median scale height of this distribution occurs at -0.75@xmath19 , with a @xmath0 lower limit of -0.98@xmath19 , and @xmath0 and @xmath54 upper limits of -0.46@xmath19 and 0.07@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the case in which emission is concentrated toward the stellar poles .",
    "the median scale height maps to a stellar surface latitude of @xmath55 for very compact emission with respect to the stellar radius , while the @xmath39 limit corresponds to @xmath56 ( the @xmath57 upper limit allows very compact emission over the whole of the stellar surface ) .",
    "the general idea behind using fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) to probe line broadening is to use the combined signal in the whole of the spectrum , rather than just a small handful of bright , well - measured lines . also crucial to the analysis of individual line widths is accurate knowledge of the strength and location blends that might significantly affect the observed line widths .",
    "the analysis above was based on single well - exposed lines for which blend contributions can be estimated reasonably well , provided the temperature structure and chemical composition of the corona are well - understood .",
    "however , for other lines somewhat weaker than our sample the blend contributions become more significant and resulting systematic uncertainties in measured line widths commensurately larger .    in a fourier approach , it is the distribution of power that matters and the exact placement of the myriad of weaker lines is less important .",
    "similar fourier techniques have been applied to high resolution optical spectra of stars , as pioneered by d.  gray and co - workers ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also in principle capable of separating rotational broadening from other broadening mechanisms such as turbulence with gaussian velocity distributions . however , _",
    "grating spectra cover a decade in resolving power from short to longer wavelengths and the broadening signatures we seek amount to , at maximum , only a fraction of the instrumental width and such fine differentiation will not be possible .",
    "our method is to compare the power spectra of the observed ab  dor hetg spectra with those of synthetic spectra that have been broadened by different rotation velocities .",
    "synthetic spectra were computed using a similar approach to that described above for individual spectral lines , using the emission measure distribution with temperature , @xmath50 , in addition to element abundances , of @xcite .",
    "owing to the mass dependency of thermal broadening , this needs to be accounted for separately for the different elements prior to convolution with the rotational broadening function and instrumental profile .    since a given rotational broadening contributes more to an observed line width at longer wavelengths where the instrumental resolving power is highest , power spectra generated from synthetic spectra",
    "are fairly sensitive to the relative intensities of the strongest lines across the wavelength range .",
    "while our simulated ab  dor spectra matched the observations very well in general ( see , e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some of the intensities of stronger fe lines , in particular , differed by @xmath58%  or so from those observed .",
    "these problems are largely attributable to difficulties and complexities in theoretical predictions of the relative line strengths themselves  a problem discussed at length in the case of fe  xvii in recent work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we therefore adjusted the simulated intensities of the strongest lines to match the observed intensities .",
    "uncertainties resulting from poisson counting statistics were estimated for the fft of the observed ab  dor spectrum using a monte carlo method .",
    "we constructed 100 realizations of the observed spectrum by randomizing the counts in each spectral bin within their observed poisson errors .",
    "an fft was then computed for each of the 100 realizations , and the @xmath59 confidence limits on the mean fft of the observed counts spectrum were obtained from the resulting fft distributions . in order to facilitate comparison between ffts of model and observed spectra , the ffts were summed over intervals of 10 bins , where the bin size was 0.005  .",
    "the observed power spectrum and uncertainties are compared with those of the synthetic spectra in figure  [ f : fft ] .",
    "this analysis indicates that spectra with only instrumental broadening are not a good match to the observations , and some additional broadening is required .",
    "the fft of the model spectrum with thermal broadening and very small additional rotational broadening corresponding to a very small scale height of @xmath60 ( essentially equivalent to the case of no rotational broadening ) provides the best match to the observations , although models with slightly larger scale heights  up to @xmath61 or so can not be excluded . the model corresponding to surface rotation scale height @xmath62 exceeds the @xmath54 error bounds at scales corresponding approximately to the line fwhm .",
    "this indicates that the model line core is broader than observations indicate .",
    "models with scale heights @xmath63 are strongly excluded .",
    "a careful analysis of _ chandra _ hetg spectra using cross - correlation and fft techniques has provided quantitative constraints on the coronal scale height and structure of the rapidly rotating corona on ab  dor .",
    "this information is encoded in the observed spectrum through doppler shifts of the source plasma .",
    "these doppler shifts amount to only a fraction of the instrumental broadening and are not easily or reliably detected in single line profiles or centroids .",
    "however , the emphasis of the study presented here is that the cross - correlation and fft techniques we have exploited use the signal in the whole of the observed spectrum and can be more sensitive than analyses based on single lines .",
    "measured wavelengths of individual spectral lines illustrated in figure  [ f : orbit_all ] show no obvious or significant doppler shifts relative to the mean frame of rest , although there is a hint of a redshift at phase @xmath64 in lines of mg  xii  @xmath42 and fe  xvii  @xmath65 that is also perhaps present in o  viii  @xmath66 .",
    "the phase @xmath64 corresponds exactly to the peak of the flare evident in the light curve in figure  [ f : lc ] and it is tempting to ascribe the weak velocity shift signature to it . if so , it would imply the flare were situated on the receding hemisphere of ab  dor .",
    "we noted in ",
    "[ s : obs ] that it is possible that the impulsive phase of the flare was obscured by the stellar disk . were this the case though we might have expected to see a blueshift rather than redshift , as the flare approached along the line - of - sight around the limb , and the lack of any net blueshift at this phase tends to argue against such an explanation . one might also expect to see blue - shifted plasma as a result of chromospheric evaporation within flaring loops on the visible hemisphere in which loops are likely to be at least partly aligned along the line - of - sight ( although to our knowledge no convincing blue - shifts due to chromospheric evaporation have been detected by _",

    "suggests the redshift hint most prominent in fe  xvii  @xmath65 is spurious with an origin in some degree of systematic uncertainty not accounted for in the analysis .",
    "the cross - correlation of phase - resolved spectra provides a much more sensitive measure of doppler shifts than any of the individual lines ( figure  [ f : crosscor ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f : crosscor ] shows that doppler shifts are almost exclusively within @xmath0 of 0  km  s@xmath3 and are perfectly consistent with no significant net velocity shift .",
    "the lack of net doppler shifts larger than @xmath67  km  s@xmath3 implies that either coronal plasma at low latitudes was relatively uniformly distributed in longitude , or that plasma was concentrated at the poles during the 1999 october epoch analyzed here .",
    "we noted in ",
    "[ s : crosscor ] that the cross - correlation technique does not distinguish between lines formed at different characteristic temperatures . in this sense ,",
    "our measurements are essentially a signal - weighted average doppler shift . since the longer wavelengths are also more sensitive to velocity , the weighting for the meg spectrum is going to be more toward the h - like ne  x ly@xmath28 line and fe  xvii and o  viii features longward of this .",
    "these ions are generally formed in the temperature range 2@xmath68 , although the increasing emission measure toward higher temperatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) means that weighting will be toward the high end of this range .",
    "the heg spectrum will be more sensitive to higher temperature features , including h- and he - like si , mg and ne .",
    "these are generally formed at temperatures of 5@xmath69  k. while the cross - correlation technique might mask some subtle differences in radial velocity with temperature , the agreement of heg and meg results , and the fact that the individual lines formed at different temperatures do not show any signs of significantly different behavior , indicates that there is no temperature schism in the structure of the ab  dor corona .",
    "the degeneracy between a corona uniformly distributed in longitude or one concentrated at the poles indicated by the lack of significant doppler shifts can be removed by examining spectral line widths , which we would expect to exhibit palpable broadening were the corona to be uniformly distributed about the star , or concentrated at low latitudes .",
    "the line widths , however , show no evidence for strong additional rotational broadening , in contrast to the hetg spectra of algol presented by @xcite .",
    "both fft and individual line width analyses favor only very small additional broadening above that induced by thermal velocities and the instrumental profile .",
    "the median coronal scale height from the monte carlo simulations of all the lines combined ( figure  [ f : height ] ) is @xmath70 ; ie less than the stellar radius as measured from the stellar centre .",
    "the @xmath0 upper limit is @xmath71also less than the stellar radius .",
    "physically , these `` negative '' scale heights can be interpreted in terms of the corona being restricted toward high latitude where rotational broadening is smaller .",
    "formally , the @xmath0 upper limit corresponds to a corona limited to latitudes @xmath72 .",
    "similarly , the fft analyses also suggest the corona lies at restricted higher latitudes .",
    "these results provide direct spectroscopic evidence that the dominant coronal emission in a rapidly - rotating active star such as ab  dor is largely associated with the dark polar spots commonly found in doppler imaging and zdi analyses of photospheric spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results are not , however , definitive : the @xmath54 upper limit to the scale height based on individual lines is @xmath73 ( surface rotation or less ) .",
    "a rigorous formal limit is more difficult to define for the fft analysis , but the data suggest strongly that @xmath73 .",
    "it is also not possible to rule out some small fraction of the emission as emanating from lower latitudes .",
    "such emission would give rise to broadened line wings , of which we see no evidence in the spectra .",
    "it is , however , possible that of the order of 10%  of the emission could be in a somewhat broader spectral component .",
    "the lack of phase - related doppler shifts in the 1999 october spectra of ab  dor contrasts with the modulation seen by ( * ? ? ? * see also @xcite ) in the light of o  viii  @xmath74 in the letg observation of 2002 december , which exhibited a to peak - to - peak velocity change of 60 km  s@xmath3 and betrayed low - latitude structure during that epoch .",
    "@xcite also investigated constraints on the coronal scale height from both _",
    "letg and fuse spectra .",
    "they found @xmath75 ( 1@xmath76 ) based on the fe  xvii  15.01    line in the 2002 december epoch letg spectra . based on fuse observations from 1999 december and 2003 december of the forbidden lines fe  xviii  @xmath17 and fe  xix  @xmath77",
    ", they obtained @xmath78 . in principle , the much higher fuse resolution ( @xmath79 ) should render tighter constraints on line profiles than _ chandra _ spectra ; unfortunately , however , the very weak forbidden fe lines are compromised by the presence of neighboring strong lines and line blends .    a salient point that the long fuse observation , and the _ chandra _ letg and hetg observations , were all obtained at significantly different epochs , should be borne in mind : while particular active longitudes apparently do exist on ab  dor @xcite , details of the coronal topology would be expected to change on shorter timescales and there is no reason that particular features hinted at by one observation should be present in another .",
    "our observations indicate that the bulk of the coronal emission persists at high latitudes .",
    "both the doppler shifts and photometric rotational modulation found by @xcite suggest that some detectable emission can also occur at lower latitudes .",
    "this picture is supported by the pattern of ambiguous euv - x - ray rotational modulation evidence discussed in ",
    "[ s : abdor ] : while some observations found significant rotational modulation , others , including the extensive study of @xcite , did not .",
    "further clues as to the temporal variation of the coronal emission of ab  dor can be gleaned from doppler and zdi maps obtained in different years .",
    "@xcite presented both spot ( doppler imaging ) and magnetic field ( zdi ) maps for ab  dor for epochs spanning 1998 - 2002 .",
    "all epochs exhibited an extensive dark polar spot covering latitudes above @xmath80 or so ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , consistent with our inference of the location of the bulk of the coronal emission , and all showed some degree of structure at lower latitudes .",
    "however , qualitatively , there is quite a striking difference between maps presented for epoch 1999.97 , which is fairly close to the epoch of our 1999 october observations , and those presented for 2001.99 in the sense that the latter contain much more extensive features and structure at mid - and low - latitudes .",
    "such structure is almost absent in the 1999.97 maps , even considering the more limited phase coverage of those observations .",
    "this matches expectations from the 1999 and 2002 _ chandra _ doppler shift results reported here and by @xcite , respectively .",
    "the late 1990 s also corresponds to the peak in brightness  and presumably the minimum in spot coverage  of ab  dor based on the photometric monitoring of @xcite .      as noted in ",
    "[ s : intro ] , the type of spectroscopic constraints on the topography of coronal plasma reported here represent potentially important observational tests of coronal structure extrapolated from zdi maps of the photospheric magnetic field .",
    "our deduction of predominately polar coronal activity on ab  dor is in qualitative agreement with the ubiquitous presence of extensive polar spots on ab  dor , and with such coronal field extrapolation by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these authors inferred that , although the corona might be quite extended , much of the model emission comes from high - latitude regions close to the stellar surface .",
    "it has been especially noted by @xcite , however , that zdi can not reveal the nature of the magnetic field in polar regions and whether field structures are predominantly closed or open .",
    "these authors have investigated the influence of different magnetic configurations on global coronal structure , while @xcite have performed magnetic flux transport simulations to study the formation of polar spots . both coriolis forces",
    "@xcite and poleward meridional flows @xcite might contribute to the accumulation of polar fields .",
    "the latter would tend to produce concentric rings of alternating polarity , while the former might be expected to produce a mixed polarity pole .",
    "@xcite find that both are actually needed to produce mixed polarity regions .",
    "images from zdi support the idea of a mixed polarity polar cap as the high latitude flux that will  feed \" the cap invariably consists of intermingled positive and negative field .",
    "in the models of @xcite , the coriolis force and poleward meridional flow both produce coronae with dominant polar regions of closed field  regions that would be bright in x - rays and consistent with our spectroscopic constraints .",
    "alternative models constructed by adding dipolar and unipolar field regions instead produce x - ray dark open field regions at the poles and more equatorially - distributed coronae that are inconsistent with the spectroscopic evidence .",
    "such models also imply rotational modulation in excess of observations @xcite and would also produce rotationally - broadened line profiles well in excess of our observed widths .",
    "the coronal models reconstructed by @xcite based on zdi contemporaneous with the letg observations analyzed by @xcite had a significant high - latitude component , similar to what we find here , but also some structure at low latitudes , in qualitative agreement with the letg spectra and x - ray light curve , and with what might be expected based on the surface imaging maps .",
    "@xcite noted that the potential field reconstructions of the coronal magnetic field depended on what was assumed for the surface magnetic field on the unseen pole ( pointed away from the line - of - sight ) .",
    "they discussed two approaches involving mapping the field on the visible pole to the invisible one , either reversing the sign of the field in the process or not .",
    "the former produced much more rotational modulation of x - ray emission  and more than has been observed  than the latter , which was therefore preferred .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that potential field extrapolation models for ab  dor can be quite different to self - consistent models including the stellar wind and effects of rotation .",
    "the wind acts to open up field lines that would otherwise remain closed without the additional wind forcing .",
    "rotational drag on the field was found to wind coronal structures quite tightly around the star , even below the alfvn radius quite close to the stellar surface .",
    "another latent issue for coronal models of all types for active , rapid rotators based on magnetic maps was discussed in detail @xcite , who considered the effects of dark spots on zdi .",
    "since this method is sensitive mainly to the magnetic field in the bright regions of the stellar surface , the magnetic signatures of the dark spots can be censored to some degree .",
    "@xcite modeled the magnetic field that might have been contained in these spots on ab  dor and the similarly fast spinning , but fully - convective and lesser spotted , m4 dwarf v374  peg by adding magnetic flux to the magnetograms .",
    "the effect of missing flux for the latter star was fairly small , but very significant for ab  dor that hosts a large , seemingly permanent , polar spot . adding polar flux of a single polarity",
    "significantly increased the model plasma emission measure as well as the rotational modulation , the latter well beyond observed limits .",
    "the correlation between x - ray luminosity and large - scale magnetic flux assessed using zdi presented by @xcite , covering several orders of magnitude in both quantities , suggests that the loss of emission measure leading to x - ray emission is probably not catastrophic and perhaps also provides some support for mixed , rather than single , polarity polar fields .",
    "the spectroscopic study presented here again tends to support a more mixed polarity field at high latitudes , which should diminish the effects of any clumpy , azimuthally non - uniform emission at lower latitudes .",
    "the results could also be important for understanding angular momentum loss on young , rapid rotators .",
    "the presence of missed polarity in the dark polar spots will act to close down field lines there that would otherwise be expected to present a strong source of wind - driven mass - loss .",
    "alternatively , the polar regions could be a copious source of flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) that might dominate the mass loss of very active stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of the latter on angular momentum loss will be difficult to assess without greater understanding of such cme events , their opening angle , and at what distance from the star they become super - alvnic .",
    "the @xcite study presents a case for caution in interpretation of observed magnetograms for use in coronal models due to the inherent limitations of the observational technique .",
    "in addition to dark spot field censoring , limited spatial resolution can also give rise to missing flux of mixed polarity on scales similar to , or smaller than , the resolution limit . this missing flux and smearing of surface magnetic field structure",
    "can also give rise to significantly different predictions of coronal structure and emission @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic studies such as that presented here , together with diagnostics of coronal plasma density and optical depth , are able to provide valuable observational leverage to overcome these difficulties , and potent tests of the properties of coronal models .",
    "we have demonstrated that _ chandra _",
    "hetg spectra are sufficiently sensitive to provide doppler shift constraints on the coronal structure of ab  dor . based on a fine analysis of individual spectral lines , and on cross - correlation and fourier techniques , we draw the following conclusions .    1 .",
    "in contrast to the finding of x - ray photometric rotational modulation and rotation - driven doppler shifts in the light of the h - like o  viii ly@xmath28 resonance line based on letg observations obtained in 2002 december by @xcite , we see no significant rotational modulation or doppler signatures in the 1999 october spectra analyzed here . a cross - correlation analysis of both heg and meg spectra places stringent limits on phase - related doppler shifts of @xmath81  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with surface images that appear to show less low - latitude structure in 1999 , and with observations of variable degrees of low - latitude spot coverage at different epochs @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence in the spectra for significant blueshifts associated with a modest flare that occurred toward the middle of the observation , which might be expected from chromospheric evaporation in loops aligned along the line - of - sight .",
    "some individual spectral lines exhibit doppler shifts which appear to be statistically significant , but which are not seen in other spectral lines ; uncertainties in observed line positions therefore contain an additional element of uncertainty above that of the formal statistics of profile fitting .",
    "as also noted by @xcite , such additional uncertainties are likely to be associated with the stability and ultimate precision of the _ chandra _ optical system .",
    "individual line widths together with fourier analysis of the whole spectrum are consistent with model profiles with very little additional rotational broadening , indicating that the emission originates at the stellar poles .",
    "these results then provide the direct spectroscopic evidence that the dominant coronal activity on rapidly - rotating active stars is associated with the dark polar spots commonly seen in photospheric doppler images .",
    "the lack of significant rotational broadening in coronal lines support models in which these spots are of mixed magnetic polarity and able to sustain closed coronal loops , rather than of dipolar or unipolar origin .",
