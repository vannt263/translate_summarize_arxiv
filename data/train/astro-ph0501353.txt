    "discovering planets outside the solar system is one of the key goals of modern astronomy . since the first detection ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) using the radial velocity technique , we have come to know of the existence of @xmath1 extra - solar planets .",
    "while radial velocity monitoring of nearby stars remains the most successful technique in this venture , a promising alternative is slowly gaining ground .",
    "this so - call ` transit ' method focuses on detecting planets that transit their host stars .",
    "it requires continuous observing of a large number of stars , but can provide independent information concerning planet characteristics otherwise unobtainable by the radial velocity technique .",
    "a couple dozens planet transit searches are currently underway ( see horne 2003 for a review ) . among these",
    ", the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) has announced a large number of planetary transit candidates ( udalski et al .",
    "2002a ; and follow - ups ) , and a number of these candidates have been confirmed spectroscopically ( e.g. , konacki et al .",
    "2003a , 2004a , 2004b ; bouchy et al . 2004 ; pont et al .",
    "2004 ; torres et al .",
    "these are selected to resemble close - in gaseous planets ( period @xmath2 days ) transiting main - sequence stars in the galactic disk .",
    "many of the ogle candidates ( e.g. ogle - tr-56 , @xmath3 days ) have orbital periods a factor of @xmath4 shorter than the closest planets discovered by the radial velocity technique .",
    "the questions arise whether this is a new population of planets and why they are not seen by the radial velocity method . if confirmed to be genuine planets , they pose intriguing challenges for understanding planet formation , migration and survival .",
    "what types of objects can masquerade as planet transits ?",
    "the success of ogle in detecting planet transits relies partly on the extreme crowdiness and hence large base numbers in its fields .",
    "however , this advantage also brings on the masqueraders  a faint eclipsing binary system can project coincidentally ( or in some cases , associate physically ) near a brighter disk star . the deep eclipses and the ellipsoidal variations from the binary",
    "are then diluted by the light from the brighter star into shallow eclipses and little variations out of transit , mimicking the signatures of a transiting planet .",
    "sirko & paczynski ( 2003 ) carefully studied the light - curves of these candidates and concluded that on average @xmath5 of these are contaminations by eclipsing binaries , with the shorter - period ones more likely to be so .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of a large number of these candidates ( konacki et al .",
    "2003a ; dreizler et al .",
    "2003 ) also reached a similar conclusion , though at a much greater observational expense .",
    "moreover , spectroscopic observations are not always able to separate the blends from genuine planetary objects as the blended main star may show little or no velocity variations ( see , e.g. torres 2004 ) .",
    "high - quality photometric light - curves can be used to rule out the blends ( seager & mallen - ornelas 2003 ) , but such data are difficult to obtain for the crowded ogle fields .",
    "it is also possible to exclude some blending configurations by comparing the observed light - curves against synthetic light - curves constructed using model isochrones ( torres 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "this latter technique is more powerful if the blend and the main star are physical triples and therefore are likely coeval .",
    "our aim in this work is to provide an independent new method to recognize blends .",
    "our method is efficient , assembly - line in style , and robust .",
    "it uses original imaging data and does not require any follow - up work . as such , this method may be broadly adopted in light of the fact that ogle and other transiting searches are likely to produce an increasing number of planet candidates in the future .",
    "moreover , our method is more suitable for detecting blends that are not physically associated ( coincidental alignment ) and thereby complements the light - curve method of torres ( 2004,2005 ) .",
    "we propose to use the fact that a blended system , albeit unresolved in the images , always leaves a tell - tale sign : the shapes of their images are not round .",
    "the magnitude of the ellipticity depends on the angular separation and the relative brightness between the primary star and the seconary blend .",
    "as we show below , we can measure the shape of a typical blend in the ogle fields with great precision .",
    "comparison of the shape in and out of transit allows us to identify blends with eclipsing binaries .",
    "for instance , a star blended with an eclipsing binary with an undiluted eclipsing depth of @xmath6 is expected to exhibit a factor of 2 change in its ellipticity between the two phases .",
    "the actual change in shape may be smaller , though still detectable , as a typical star in the ogle fields is multiply blended .",
    "the success of this technique depends critically on how well we measure the shape of a star , in relation to other stars in the same image .",
    "this is where the only major obstacle in this method arises : the point - spread - function ( psf ) varies across the image due to a multitude of distortions in the photon pathway .",
    "it also varies with time as the pathway changes and the seeing fluctuates .",
    "psf anisotropy and seeing change the shapes of the objects and renders raw measurements of the ellipticity unreliable . a similar problem exists in weak gravitational lensing , where one has to disentangle the",
    "lensing induced distortions in the shapes of faint galaxies from these observational effects .",
    "fortunately , the weak lensing community has studied this problem in great detail and has come up with solutions which we adapt to the case in hand .",
    "we note that the method we develop here have aspects unique to the stellar problem .    among the hundreds of transiting systems published by the ogle - iii team ( udalski et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b , 2002c ) , we choose to focus our initial efforts on two candidates , ogle - tr-3 and ogle - tr-56 . on the basis of spectroscopic follow - up observations with 8 m class telescopes ,",
    "these two candidates were identified as likely planetary candidates since their host stars show little or no velocity variations ( konacki et al . 2003a ; dreizler et al . 2003 ) .",
    "tr-56 undergoes genuine flat - bottom transit and has detectable radial velocity variations , both consistent with a planet explanation . for this candidate",
    ", the blending scenario was examined in detail by torres et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who were able to confirm the planetary nature of this object using a combined analysis of the light curve and radial velocity measurements .",
    "the interpretation for tr-3 , however , is more open to debate .",
    "it shows no significant velocity variations , its light curve contains hints of a secondary eclipse as well as out - of - eclipse fluctuations ( sirko & paczynski 2003 ; konacki 2003a ) .",
    "the method presented here provides a completely independent assessment of the identities of these two objects .",
    "we briefly describe the data in  2 .",
    "the shape measurement technique is described in detail in  3 . in ",
    "4 we provide an extensive test of our analysis and present the results for the two planet transit candidates in  5 .",
    "the data we analyze were obtained during the third phase of ogle ( ogle iii , udalski et al .",
    "these were collected using the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at the las campanas observatory , equipped with the 8k mosaic camera .",
    "the field of view of the camera is about 35 by 35 arcminutes , with a pixel scale of @xmath7/pixel .",
    "the observations were done in the @xmath8-band , and have exposure times of 120s .",
    "our analysis does not require the full field , so instead we use small cuts of 600 by 600 pixels , not necessarily centered on the target candidate .",
    "for tr-3 we have 109 images in - transit and 308 images out - of - transit , whereas we have 65 and 259 images , respectively , for tr-56 .",
    "we retrieved all in - transit images , which results in a broad range in seeing . to minimize the systematic errors caused by the seeing correction ( see  3.2 ) , we have selected out - of - transit images such that their seeing distribution resembles that of the in - transit data .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ seeing_dist ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the shape measurements , focussing on how to deal with the variable psf .",
    "the methodology is based on the techniques developed for weak gravitational lensing applications ( e.g. , see kaiser , squires & broadhurst 1995 ; hoekstra et al .",
    "1998 ) , and we adopt their notation .",
    "the correction for the psf can be split into two separate steps .",
    "the first one is the correction for the anisotropic part of the psf , which induces an ellipticity in addition to the intrinsic ellipticity of the object under investigation .",
    "the second step is the correction for the circularization by the psf ( i.e. , seeing ) , which typically lowers the ellipticity . for both steps",
    ", we require a set of comparison stars which can be presumed to be intrinsically round .",
    "to quantify the shapes , we use the central second moments @xmath9 of the image fluxes and form the two - component polarisation    @xmath10    because of photon noise , unweighted second moments can not be used .",
    "instead we use a circular gaussian weight function , with a dispersion @xmath11 :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the pixel number in the direction of the @xmath14-axis , pointing away from the centroid of the object . for the weight function",
    "@xmath15 we adopt a gaussian with a dispersion @xmath11 . for the analysis presented here ,",
    "the weighted moments are measured from the images within an aperture with a radius of 6 pixels , and we take @xmath16 pixels , which is the optimal width for a seeing of 09 .",
    "these choices suppress the contributions from nearby stars .      in practice",
    ", the psf will not be isotropic .",
    "instead , the images are typically concolved with an anisotropic psf , which induces coherent ellipticities in the images . in order to recover the true `` shape '' of the blend , we need to undo the effect of the psf anisotropy .",
    "the correction scheme we use is based on that developed by kaiser , squires & broadhurst ( 1995 ) , with modifications described in hoekstra et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the effect of an anisotropic psf on the polarisation @xmath17 of an object is quantified by the `` smear polarisability '' @xmath18 , which measures the response of the polarisation to a convolution with an anisotropic psf , and can be estimated for each object from the data ( see hoekstra et al .",
    "1998 for the correct expressions ) .",
    "having measured the polarisations and smear polarisabilities , the corrected polarisations are given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a measure of the psf anisotropy .",
    "it is measured using a true point source by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 are the measured ellipticity of the point source and @xmath23 the diagonal components of its smear polarisability tensor .",
    "formally , the correction requires the use of the full two by two tensor , but the off - diagonal terms are typically small .",
    "examination of the measured values indicates that they are consistent with noise .",
    "we therefore only use the diagonal terms in the correction for psf anisotropy .",
    "this correction has been tested extensively in the case of galaxies convolved with an anisotropic psf ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",
    "1998 ; erben et al .",
    "2001 ) . for this application ,",
    "the correction works well , because galaxies are centrally concentrated , and their shapes are well characterized by the quadrupole moments .    in the case of two or more nearby point sources",
    "the situation is somewhat different : the shape is not well described by a simple quadrupole , and higher order moments are expected to contribute to the polarisation .",
    "to explore this in more detail , we created images that were convolved with a moffat ( 1969 ) profile and then convolved with a line ( which simulates the psf anisotropy ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of this study can be found in the appendix .",
    "here we summarize the main conclusion .",
    "the simulations indicate that the correction given by eqn .  3 is incomplete and that an additional term proportional to @xmath24 ( the total size of the anisotropy ) is needed .",
    "this leads to an improved correction for psf anisotropy , albeit empirical , given by    @xmath25    where the value of @xmath26 depends on the configuration of the point sources ( separation and flux ratio ) and the seeing .",
    "we found that the size of @xmath26 is proportional to the polarisation of the object .",
    "this is supported by an examination of the residuals in the shapes of the objects in the ogle data .",
    "the fact that @xmath26 is proportional to the polarisation is not surprising : when the polarisation is larger , the higher order moments become more important .",
    "however , in the case of ogle , blends with more than one source are likely .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to compute the expected value of @xmath26 .",
    "instead , we determine the value empirically by fitting a term proportional to @xmath24 to the shape measurements .",
    "the psf anisotropy depends on the position of the object on the chip and it typically varies with time .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to characterize the spatial variation of the psf anisotropy with a low order polynomial model fitted to a subsample of the objects identified as suitable stars ( i.e. , the stars should be bright but not saturated ) .",
    "this works particularly well for the data used here , as we use relatively small regions around the ogle transit candidates . for the analysis here we model the spatial variation by a second order polynomial .",
    "such a model is derived for each exposure and used to undo the effect of the psf anisotropy .",
    "the derivation of the psf anisotropy model implicitely assumes that the set of comparison stars are intrinsically round : i.e. , the observed polarisation is solely caused by psf anisotropy .",
    "it is possible to reject wide separation binaries ( or blends ) from this set on the basis of their large ellipticities , but it is more difficult to reject stars that have a small intrinsic ellipticity because of a companion .",
    "however , so long as the number of comparison stars is sufficiently large , because their position angles are uncorrelated with each other and with the psf anisotropy , we still can obtain an unbiased model for the psf anisotropy .    in the case of ogle ,",
    "severe crowding means most bright stars are blended with fainter stars . as a result",
    ", the noise introduced by the blends can be substantial .",
    "nevertheless , we can find a set of brighter stars which are comparatively less affected by blending and provide good estimates for the psf anisotropy .",
    "the result of this procedure carried over one frame is presented in figure  [ psf_an ] : we detected significant psf anisotropy , and found that a second - order polynomial is sufficient to remove the psf anisotropy across the whole image , leaving residual @xmath27 and @xmath28 scattering randomly around the zero - level .    in the absence of blending and shot noise , the corrected ellipticities should all be zero ( assuming the model used to correct for the psf anisotropy is perfect ) . however ,",
    "blending gives rise to non - zero ellipticities for the stars and is partly responsible for the residual anisotropy in figure  [ psf_an ] .",
    "we measure this `` intrinsic '' ellipticity of the stars used in the psf anisotropy correction using repeated observations taken by the ogle team ( as this procedure reduces the shot noise ) .",
    "we then subtract the `` intrinsic '' ellipticities from the observed ones and obtain an improved fit .",
    "we found that this iteration had little effect on the results , because of the random orientations of the blends .",
    "large values of psf anisotropy are typically a nuisance , as they imply larger corrections .",
    "however , the large range of psf anisotropy ( fig .",
    "[ psfan_dist ] ) exhibited by the ogle observations is helpful for the purpose of our paper : it allows us to examine the accuracy of the correction for psf anisotropy in more detail , and to understand the limitation of our algorithm .",
    "the second step in our correction procedure is to account for the effect of seeing , i.e. , the isotropic part of the psf .",
    "typically , an object will appear rounder with increasing seeing .",
    "an example is presented in the left panels of figure  [ seeing_var ] , which shows the ellipticities for one of the stars in tr-3 field as the seeing varies .",
    "the dependence on seeing can be rather complicated , with some configurations appearing more eccentric with increasing seeing .    in the simple case of a single blend , one could use simulations to attempt to determine the seeing dependence .",
    "this is not feasible here , because the target stars are on average blended with 1.5 objects .",
    "instead , we make use of the fact that the observations span a large range in seeing ( see fig .",
    "[ seeing_dist ] and fig .",
    "[ seeing_var ] ) to remove the seeing dependence empirically . using the following model , individually tuned for each star ,    @xmath29    this second - order fitting is sufficient to remove any visible seeing dependence for , e.g. , the object shown in figure  [ seeing_var ] . from now on ,",
    "we report the shape measurement for a fiducial seeing , taken to be 1 arcsecond .",
    "we selected a sample of a total of 171 stars around the transit candidate in the two fields .",
    "these stars have some range in brightness and ellipticity .",
    "we demonstrate below our capabilities in removing the effects of psf anisotropy and seeing .",
    "to examine the accuracy of the psf anisotropy correction , we split the in - transit data into two subsets of similar sizes : one with large psf anisotropy ( @xmath24 ) and one with small @xmath24 .",
    "the two subsets have a similar range in seeing .    in figure  [ psfcor ] , we present the differences in ellipticity measurements for these comparison stars , without correcting for psf anisotropy ( upper panels ) , after using equation  ( 3 ) to correct for the anisotropy ( middle panels ) , and after using equation  ( 5 ) to correct for the anisotropy ( lower panels ) .",
    "this experiment convinced us that we can remove psf anisotropy successfully from our data .",
    "the reduced @xmath30 for the results in the lower panels of figure  [ psfcor ] is close to unity , indicating that the estimated errors are a fair estimate of the statistical uncertainty in the measurements .    in producing figure",
    "[ psfcor ] , we have applied a seeing correction that is based on the combined in - transit data , minimizing the systematics caused by the latter correction . as mentioned above , the seeing ranges are similar for both samples , so psf anisotropy is the only systematic relevant for comparison .",
    "upper panels in figure  [ shape_zoom ] expand the view from the lower panels of figure  [ psfcor ] for the small ellipticity objects , while lower panels in figure  [ shape_zoom ] shows results from the same procedure using out - of - transit data . for some of the brighter objects , the achieved error bars are as small as @xmath31 .",
    "this capability to measure shapes accurately brings about another potential application for the algorithm described here : finding binary stars that are too close , or are too different in fluxes , to be resolved ( also see  6 ) .",
    "we now examine the reliability of the correction for seeing . if this is successful , we will be able to accurately measure the in and out - of - transit ellipticity changes in planet candidates , and constrain the blending scenario .    as shown in figure  [ seeing_dist ] , the seeing distributions for the in and out - of - transit data",
    "were chosen to be similar , i.e. we selected out - of - transit images such that the two distributions match .",
    "this approach minimizes the sensitivity of our results to systematic errors caused by the adopted seeing correction .",
    "we fit equation  ( 6 ) to the in and out - of - transit measurements separately .",
    "the resulting differences between the in and out - of - transit data are presented in figure  [ difference ] .",
    "panels  a and  b show the differences in @xmath32 and and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the lower panels in figure  [ difference ] show histograms of the differences in units of the estimated measurement uncertainty . for a normal distribution",
    ", this should be a gaussian with a dispersion of 2 , which is indicated by the solid smooth line .",
    "this gaussian provides a fair match to the observed scatter , but the data show more outliers than what would be expected from a normal distribution . for @xmath34 we obtain a reduced @xmath35=1.31 and for @xmath36 we find a similar value of @xmath35=1.37 , larger than the expected value around unity .",
    "these values reduce to 1.14 and 1.16 respectively when we reject objects that are more than @xmath37 away from zero .",
    "the bootstrap analysis provides an estimate of the random error but not of the systematic error .",
    "the results presented in figure  [ difference ] suggest that the estimated errors are typically correct , but in a few cases , residual systematic errors are still present in the data leading to the excess of outlyers .",
    "nevertheless , the results presented in figure  [ difference ] do suggest that for most objects we can measure the difference in shapes between the in and out - of - transit data accurately .",
    "we have attempted to identify what is causing some of the outlyers , but have not been able to find an obvious way to improve the measurements .",
    "we suspect that it might be due to imperfections in the correction for psf anisotropy .",
    "we also note that some of the objects are not present in all exposures ( as they lie too close to the edge ) , which might lead to differences in the actual seeing distributions , which in turn can lead to systematic errors in the shape differences .",
    "the size of the final error bar as used in figure  [ difference ] depends on the number of frames used as well as on the apparent magnitude of the object : the shape measurements in a single frame will be noisier for fainter stars .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ error ] , which shows the error in @xmath32 and @xmath33 as a function of apparent magnitude for the out - of - transit shape measurements .",
    "as expected , the errors increase with magnitude .",
    "this is more clearly seen for `` rounder '' objects , which are affected less by the correction for seeing and the last term in equation  5 for the psf anisotropy correction .",
    "we also computed the smallest possible error bar as a function of apparent magnitude using simulated images . in these images , which have the same noise properties as the ogle data , we measured the scatter in the shape of a point source . in this case",
    ", the error is solely due to poisson noise .",
    "the result is given by the dashed curve in figure  [ error ] .",
    "the actual error bars are larger , because of the uncertainties introduced by the empirical corrections for psf anisotropy and seeing .",
    "finally , figure  [ error ] also demonstrates that the accuracy with which one can measure shapes is excellent : the typical uncertainty for a star with @xmath38 is @xmath39 .",
    "the results presented in the previous section demonstrates our ability to accurately measure the shapes of objects in the ogle fields . in this section we present results for the two ogle planet transit candidates .",
    "table  [ tab_shapes]a lists the final polarisations for tr-3 and tr-56 at a fiducial seeing of 1 arcsecond measured from the out - of - transit images . we detect a significant polarisation for both transit candidates , thus implying that they are both blended with other sources . in fact , most stars studied in the crowded ogle fields show evidence of blending ( or even multiple blending ) . within a circle of @xmath40 radius ,",
    "an average star is surrounded by @xmath41 companions , with a mean flux ratio of @xmath42 and a mean sepration of @xmath43 .",
    "the resulting average ellipticity of the blend depends mainly on the brightness of the primary star : the brighter the star , the smaller the ellipticity .",
    "figure  [ edist ] shows the distribution of @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the analysed stars in the fields of tr-3 and tr-56 ( indicated by the crosses ) .",
    "the two transit candidates are indicated by the open circles , with tr-3 being the point on the left .",
    "although the distribution is peaked towards round objects , the observed ellipticities for the transit candidates are by no means anomalous .    to test whether the planet - like transit is caused by a blended eclipsing binary , we also list in table  [ tab_shapes]b differences in shape between the out and in transit data for these two stars :",
    "a significant change in shape would confirm that the blend is an eclipsing binary .",
    "we detect no change in shape in tr-56 , suggesting that the observed transit is a genuine planetary transit , in line with evidences from radial velocity , line - curve analysis and isochrone fitting ( e.g. , torres et al . 2005 ) .    in tr-3 ,",
    "however , we do observe a change in shape : the ellipticity in - transit is larger .",
    "the errors inferred from the bootstrap analysis suggest a significance of @xmath44 .",
    "however , the results presented in section 4.2 and figure  [ difference ] indicate that the distribution of errors is not exactly gaussian , but has tails .",
    "we therefore need to account for the possibility that the change in shape is caused by residual systematics . to this end , a more conservative estimate of the significance of the change in shape for tr3 can be obtained by considering the fraction of studied objects that show a difference at least as large as tr-3 .    of the objects in the fields of tr-3 and tr-56 ,",
    "accurate shapes could be determined for 171 of them .",
    "none of these objects show an ellipticity change as large as tr-3 , and we can only derive a lower limit to the probability for the observed shape change in tr-3 to be caused by systematic effects : the probability is less than @xmath45 . this is larger than the probability of a @xmath46 event ( @xmath47 ) but still sufficiently small for us to conclude that it is very likely that tr-3 is indeed a blend with an eclipsing binary system .",
    "if tr-3 is only singly blended , its polarisation should decrease by a factor of 2 during eclipse , an effect that should be emminently detectable .",
    "however , we find that its ellipticity increases by @xmath48 during eclipse .",
    "this can be explained if tr-3 is multiply blended .",
    "in fact , we have also measured tr-3 s polarization ( out - of - transit ) using different weight functions ( @xmath11 in eq . [ 2 ] ) .",
    "it varies with @xmath11 differently than a singly - blended object would , suggesting that it is indeed multiply blended . in the case of multiple blending , provided that the primary star is much brighter than the blending stars , the resulting ellipticity is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of blends , and @xmath51 is the contribution from each blend .",
    "consequently , if two blends have opposite signs for @xmath52 , the polarisation can actually increase during an eclipse .",
    "if we assume that the observed eclipse is caused by a blend with an eclipsing binary , with a eclipse depth @xmath6 ( i.e. , a full eclipse of an equal mass system ) , we can place limits on the configuration of the blend .",
    "to do so , we note that the depth of the observed transit is @xmath53 , which implies that the flux of the presumed binary contributes @xmath42 to the total flux . under these assumptions ,",
    "the change in ellipticity indicates that the binary is located @xmath54 arcseconds from the brighter star .",
    "if the eclipse depth is reduced to 25% , the presumed binary contributes 8% of the flux instead , and the separation decreases to @xmath55 arseconds .",
    "these numbers are below the resolution limit of the photometry ( by analysing centroid shift in and out of eclipse , @xmath56 ) , and the blend is likely a background source ( as opposed to a physical triple with the main star ) .",
    "interestingly , by examining the light - curve in detail , konacki ( 2003b ) have also come to a similar conclusion that tr-3 is likely a blend of a background eclipsing binary with a forground bright star .",
    "our result here confirms their suggestion and predicts the position of the blend .",
    "the sepration from the main star is small but should be detectable by hst observations .",
    "we have presented an algorithm that can detect blends of bright stars with fainter eclipsing binaries .",
    "such systems contaminate searches for transiting planets , in particular in crowded fields where blends are common .",
    "this technique provides a cheap way to find such blends , thus minimizing the amount of time required on large aperture telescope for spectroscopic follow - up of planet candidates .",
    "we have demonstrated the accuracy with which shapes can be measured using imaging data from the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) .",
    "our method requires a careful correction of the point spread function which varies both with time and across the field . to this end",
    "we have adopted a method developed in weak gravitational lensing with modifications necessary for this particular application .",
    "we have tested the correction for psf anisotropy in great detail , using a sample of 171 stars surrounding the two planet transit candidates studied here .",
    "comparison of samples with large and small psf anisotropy indicates that this correction can be applied with great accuracy . for a star with an apparent magnitude @xmath38",
    ", we obtain a @xmath57 uncertainty of @xmath58 in the polarisation .    applied to ogle - tr-3 and ogle - tr-56 , two of the planetary candidates ,",
    "we show that both systems are indeed blended with fainter stars , as are most other stars in the ogle fields . in the case of tr-56",
    "we do not detect a change in shape in and out of transit , consistent with it indeed being a genuine planetary object .",
    "for tr-3 we observe a significant change in shape . if we adopt the error bars from the bootstrap analysis , the significance is @xmath44 .",
    "however , the distribution of errors is not precisely gaussian , but has tails .",
    "a more conservative estimate of the significance , estimated from the observed distribution of shape differences , provides an upper limit of @xmath59 to the probability that the observed change is caused by residual systematics .",
    "our results favour the scenario where tr-3 is caused by a blend with a background eclipsing binary , in line with evidences from other studies .",
    "a number of studies have appeared since the ogle announcement of transit candidates , mostly aiming at distinguishing blends from genuine planets .",
    "in contrast to some of these studies which carry out follow - up spectroscopy using large telescopes , our approach uses original imaging data and is a value - added application .",
    "moreover , unlike studies which perform detailed light - curve fitting or isochrone stellar model fitting , our method is assembly - line in style and can be applied to a large number of transit candidates without too much human interaction .",
    "lastly , our technique is especially suited to finding blends that are not physically associated with the bright star , and is therefore complementary to the isochrone fitting technique which is more powerful for the physical triple case .",
    "given the efficiency in dealing with a large number of objects without requiring additional data , the shape method may also be useful for other planetary transit searches , in particular the nasa kepler mission .",
    "this transit mission aims to detect @xmath60 giant inner planets and @xmath61 terrestrial planets .",
    "recently the target survey area has been moved to a higher galactic latittude to reduce the confusion by blends with eclipsing binaries .",
    "a quick examination of the usno - b catalogue ( monet 2003 ) in this new field suggests that the stellar density is @xmath62 times less dense than that in the ogle field , with a similar number distribution in stellar magnitudes .",
    "however , stars in kepler have a psf of @xmath63 radius , we therefore expect each bright star ( @xmath64 ) to have @xmath65 companions within the psf envelope , compared to @xmath41 ( @xmath66 ) in the ogle case . the probability of blending with an eclipsing binary is likely enhanced by a similar ratio .",
    "more study is necessary to determine the false - positive rate due to blending in kepler , armed with the experience from ogle .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that our shape technique can be readily applied to this mission .    the achieved accuracy in measuring the shape of stars also bodes well for another potential application of our algorithm : finding binary stars that are too close to be resolved , yet too far apart for radial velocity studies . by detecting small deviations from circularity",
    ", we should be able to discover intermediate separation binaries ( @xmath67 ) with flux ratio as low as @xmath68 , within a large volumn of our galaxy .",
    "this will not only complement existing binary searches , but its high efficiency may also disclose binary population with an unprecedented rate such as to enable new and meaningful statistical studies . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will investigate this application in more detail , and apply it to wide field imaging data from the explore project ( malln - ornelas et al .",
    "20003 ; yee et al .",
    "2003 ) , which were obtained with the aim of finding transiting planets .",
    "au acknowledges support from the polish kbn grant 2p03d02124 and the grant `` subsydium profesorskie '' of the foundation for polish science .",
    "as indicated by figure  [ psfcor ] the correction for psf anisotropy using equation  3 leaves a systematic residual , roughly proportional to the polarisation .",
    "this correction scheme has been used extensively in weak lensing applications , and has been tested in great detail .",
    "the difference between the analysis of galaxies and the blends considered here , is that the shapes of galaxies are well characterized by their quadrupole moments . in the case of two point sources ,",
    "higher order moments contribute to the moments .    in this section",
    "we examine how to improve the correction for psf anisotropy , in particular we justify the use of equation  5 . unlike the case for galaxies ( kaiser et al .",
    "1995 ) , this problem is too complicated to solve analytically . instead we study the effect of psf anisotropy on simulated images of two point sources .",
    "we also note that new methods have been developed in which the images of the objects are decomposed into a series of localized basis functions .",
    "for instance , bernstein & jarvis ( 2002 ) use laguerre expansions , whereas refregier ( 2003 ) adopted weighted hermite polynomials .",
    "the advantage of these methods might be that they can quantify higher order moments of the images . nevertheless , as we will show below ( and in  4 ) , the empirical extension of the kaiser et al .",
    "( 1995 ) method is adequate for the results presented here .",
    "we create well oversampled images of two point sources , and convolve these with a moffat function , with a width given by the required seeing .",
    "these images are then convolved with a `` line '' , which simulates the effect of psf anisotropy .",
    "examples for two configurations are indicated by the thin solid lines in figure  [ cormod ] .",
    "the results presented in this figure are for a case where the psf anisotropy is given by @xmath69 alone , with the other component set to zero .",
    "a single point source would show a linear trend with @xmath69 , but because of the second point source the slope changes when @xmath69 changes sign .",
    "the next step is to correct these polarisations for psf anisotropy .",
    "if we use equation  3 , we obtain the dashed lines in figure  [ cormod ] . in both cases we see a clear residual @xmath70 , and not just @xmath71 .",
    "these results have led us to consider an additional term in the correction @xmath72 , leading to equation  5 .",
    "based on a large set of simulations , we found that the slope of the trend is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "this is not completely surprising , because the amplitude of the polarisation is a measure of the importance of the second point source , and consequently a measure of the relevance of higher order moments .",
    "hence the additional term in the correction for psf anisotropy is given by @xmath73 .",
    "we examined what value for @xmath74 yields the best correction .",
    "the results indicate that @xmath74 depends on the configuration , in particular on the flux ratio .",
    "for instance , in figure  [ cormod]a we used @xmath75 and in fig .",
    "[ cormod]b we obtained the best result for @xmath76 to obtain the improved corrections , indicated by the dotted lines .",
    "overall , the range in @xmath74 appears to be fairly small , although its value is difficult to determine if the polarisations are small ( i.e. , when the additional correction is small ) .",
    "we note that the conclusions listed above are based on our empirical study of the simulated images . using equation  5 ,",
    "the correction for psf anisotropy works well for most of the situations ( as is the case for the ones presented in fig .",
    "[ cormod ] ) . in some extreme cases , however , with large values for the polarisation and psf anisotropy ,",
    "the correction leaves significant residuals ( relative errors as large as 10% ) .",
