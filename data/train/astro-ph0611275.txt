    "the discovery of sdss j1004 + 4112 with an image separation of @xmath3 , the first example of a quasar multiply imaged by a massive cluster of galaxies , opened a new window for understanding our universe @xcite .",
    "although there are many examples of galaxies ( arcs ) lensed by clusters , large - separation lensed quasars have several advantages over arcs as a cosmological probe .",
    "first , the simpler ( point - like ) structure of quasars and their well - understood redshift distribution should make the large - separation lensed quasars much cleaner probes of cosmology and structure formation models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the statistics of arcs remain contentious @xcite .",
    "second , the time - variability of quasars allows the measurement of time delays among the multiple lensed images , thereby breaking the mass - sheet degeneracy of lens models given a priori knowledge of the hubble constant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "our current problem is that the small number of known systems limits their use in statistical analyses , however , current and future large lens surveys will discover many large - separation lensed quasars @xcite .    in this _ letter _ , we report the discovery of the second large - separation lensed quasar , sdss j1029 + 2623 , a quasar at @xmath4 doubly imaged by a massive galaxy cluster at @xmath5 . it was discovered in the course of the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search ( sqls ;",
    "* ) , which is a survey of strongly lensed quasars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "the image separation of @xmath1 makes it the largest separation lens among the @xmath6 lensed quasars known so far @xcite .",
    "from the sdss - ii sloan legacy survey data , we discovered the lens candidate sdss j1029 + 2623 using the algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a quasar whose redshift was spectroscopically measured by the sdss to be @xmath7 ( hereafter referred to as a ) and a stellar object ( hereafter b ) with almost the same color as component a ( see table [ tab : info ] ) .",
    "components a and b are separated by @xmath1 .",
    "there are no other point sources in the field with similar colors that would be candidates for additional quasar images .",
    "in addition to the similar colors , the @xmath8 composite sdss image shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : img ] exhibits a concentration of red galaxies centered on two bright galaxies ( named g1 and g2 ) , which implies the existence of a high - redshift cluster of galaxies .",
    "indeed , the photometric redshifts of g1 and g2 are both @xmath90.55 from their sdss colors @xcite .",
    "the properties of components a , b , g1 , and g2 are summarized in table [ tab : info ] .",
    "we note that the details of the sdss are described in a series of technical papers : @xcite for the dedicated wide - field ( @xmath10 field of view ) 2.5-m telescope ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for the photometric survey ; @xcite for the spectroscopic target selection algorithm of quasars ; and @xcite for the tiling algorithm of the spectroscopic survey .",
    "most of the sdss data are already publicly available @xcite .",
    "we obtained 600  sec spectra of components a and b with the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the subaru 8.2-meter telescope on 2006 june 28 .",
    "the observation was conducted in the 3@xmath111 on - chip binning mode , using the 300b grism , the sy47 filter and a @xmath12-width slit aligned along components a and b. the spectral resolution , wavelength coverage , and spatial scale of the ccd detector were @xmath13 , from 4700 to 9400 , and @xmath14 pixel@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "although the seeing was poor ( @xmath918 ) , the @xmath1 separation makes it easy to extract the spectra of the two components using standard iraf tasks .",
    "the spectra are shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "it is clear that both components are quasars at the same redshift , @xmath16 ( see table [ tab : info ] ) .",
    "moreover , the spectral shapes are similar ; both components have similar broad absorption line features at the same wavelength in the emission lines , similar profiles for the emission lines , and similar characteristic shapes of the red wings of the emission lines .",
    "in addition , the spectral flux ratio plotted in the lower panel of figure [ fig : spec ] is constant ( @xmath17 ) over the full range of the observed wavelengths .",
    "the similarity of the spectra supports the idea that the two components are lensed images of a single quasar .    .",
    "the feature at 7600 is atmospheric .",
    "the inset shows an expanded view of the emission lines .",
    "the vertical dot - dashed line in the inset shows the central position of the broad absorption lines . in the bottom panel ,",
    "the black solid line shows the spectral flux ratio between a and b , and the dark gray solid line shows the 1@xmath18 error of the spectral flux ratio , which is derived from the noise per pixel in each spectrum .",
    "the ratio is confirmed to be constant ( @xmath17 ) within the @xmath19 error , over the entire range of observed wavelengths .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ]    we also obtained 120  sec @xmath20- and 120  sec @xmath21-band images ( @xmath918 seeing ) with focas .",
    "on - chip @xmath22 binning yielded images with a pixel scale of 0207 pixel@xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath21-band image is shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig : img ] . from the focas images",
    ", we found that galaxy g1 is likely to be a superposition of two early - type galaxies ; however , we treated them as a single object since the poor seeing prevents us from separating them .",
    "we used sextractor @xcite for the photometry ( mag_auto ) calibrated by the sdss magnitudes of the nearby stars magnitudes of the nearby stars from the sdss @xmath23 magnitudes . ] .",
    "all galaxies ( classified by the combination of the sextractor class_star parameter and visual inspection ) with @xmath24 are plotted as filled circles in the right panel of figure [ fig : img ] . among them , we selected galaxies with colors of @xmath25 as possible cluster members , because g1 and g2 have @xmath26 colors of 0.6 and 0.8 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath26 color of 0.7 is consistent with the red - sequence color of a galaxy cluster at @xmath27 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the selected galaxies are plotted as dark filled circles in the right panel of figure [ fig : img ] .",
    "as expected , clustering of galaxies near g1 and g2 is much more pronounced after the color cut , suggesting the existence of a cluster of galaxies at @xmath28 .",
    "an interesting thing about this lens system is that the quasar images and the light center of the lensing cluster appear not to be collinear ( see figure [ fig : img ] ) .",
    "brightest cluster galaxies are sometimes significantly offset from the center of a cluster mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the lack of collinearity does not necessarily argue against the lensing hypothesis .",
    "nevertheless , it is of great interest to understand the impact of this offset for lens models . to explore this , we use standard mass modeling techniques as implemented in the public _ lensmodel _",
    "software @xcite .",
    "since the small number of observational constraints limits detailed investigations of the mass distribution , we adopt the simplest model used for modeling studies , a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) .",
    "we fit the quasar positions and fluxes assuming a position error of @xmath29 and a flux error of 20% ; we adopt errors larger than the actual measurement errors in order to account for perturbations from massive galaxies in the cluster .",
    "in addition we include a mild prior on the ellipticity , @xmath30 , to exclude models with a highly elongated cluster . with this model , we derive the allowed range for the center position of the lensing cluster potential , as shown in figure [ fig : model ] .",
    "the offset of at least @xmath31  kpc between the preferred model positions and galaxies g1 and g2 suggests either that the actual mass distribution of the lensing cluster is more complex than this simple model or that there is a genuine offset that might be confirmed in x - ray observations .    while the similarity of the optical spectra and the existence of the lensing galaxy cluster make the lensing interpretation solid , we can further test the lensing hypothesis using archival data at other wavelengths . in the first radio survey @xcite , there are two radio sources in the field : galaxy g2 , with a peak flux of 4.20 mjy / beam , is the strongest source , component b , with a peak flux of 1.01 mjy / beam , is detected just at the flux limit , and component a is not detected . although the difference could be explained by quasar variability combined with the time delay between the lensed images , it might argue a binary interpretation for the quasars . in order to clarify the interpretation of the first radio data , we obtained a 1 hour 6 cm very large array ( vla ) radio map of the system on 23 september 2006 .",
    "figure [ fig : vla ] shows the primary beam corrected vla 6 cm map ; both quasar components have more than 5@xmath18 detections ( 0.237@xmath320.045 mjy / beam for a and 0.325@xmath320.045 mjy / beam for b )",
    ". there are some offsets ( but within 5@xmath18 , see table [ tab : info ] ) between the sdss positions and the vla positions of the quasar components",
    ". however both components are extended in the vla data and better quality data will be necessary to clarify the offsets .",
    "the radio loudnesses of the images , defined relative to the sdss @xmath21-band fluxes , are 1.8 and 2.5 for images a and b , respectively . the radio flux ratio ( a / b ) of 0.73 is mildly inconsistent with the optical flux ratio of 1.2 , however , allowing for variability both between the epochs of the two observations and the multi - year time delay of the two images , finding two quasars with such similar radio loudnesses further supports the lensing hypothesis given the enormous range of radio loudnesses observed for quasars @xcite .",
    "the system was also detected as 1rxs j102912.0 + 262338 by the rosat all - sky survey @xcite with a count rate of @xmath33 counts s@xmath34 .",
    "this corresponds to an 0.1 - 2.4  kev flux of approximately @xmath35 ergs @xmath36 s@xmath15 , and it is flagged as an extended source , albeit at low significance .",
    "the x - ray position could be consistent with the position of g2 given the @xmath37 uncertainties in the x - ray data ( figure [ fig : vla ] ) .",
    "assuming the x - ray signals arise from the lensing cluster ( @xmath27 ) , the x - ray luminosity is approximately @xmath38 ergs s@xmath34 ( for a cosmological model with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) and corresponds to a velocity dispersion of approximately @xmath41  km s@xmath15 that is slightly larger than the velocity scale of @xmath42  km s@xmath15 needed to produce the 225 image separation .",
    "thus the x - ray luminosity is a little too high , suggesting that the agn in galaxy g2 is an x - ray source as well as a radio source , even though it shows no signs of agn activity in its broad band optical colors .    in summary ,",
    "the best interpretation of the two quasar components in the sdss j1029 + 2623 system is that a quasar at @xmath0 is doubly imaged by a cluster of galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "the evidence for strong lensing comes from the remarkable similarity of the spectral shapes and the similar radio loudnesses of the two quasars , and the existence of the lensing cluster with the presence of an extended x - ray source which is capable of producing the observed image separation .",
    "however , simple mass models require a center of the cluster potential offset from the positions of the bright galaxies or the rosat x - ray emission .",
    "such an offset with respect to the bright galaxies was also found for the sdss1004 + 4112 system @xcite , and the x - ray position may be dominated by the agn in galaxy g2 .",
    "thus , further follow - up observations , such as deep and high - resolution x - ray imaging and optical spectroscopy of member galaxies are needed to identify the cluster potential center .",
