    "we consider the following ( vague ) rules :    0.15 cm    @xmath15 vacant sites become occupied ( a seed falls and a tree immediately grows ) at rate @xmath16 ;    0.15 cm    @xmath15 occupied sites take fire ( a match falls ) at rate @xmath17 ;    0.15 cm    @xmath15 fires propagate to neighbors ( inside the forest ) at rate @xmath18 .",
    "0.15 cm    such a model was introduced by henley @xcite and drossel and schwabl @xcite as a toy model for forest fire propagation and as an example of a simple model intended to clarify the concept of _ self - organized criticality_.    0.15 cm    the order of magnitude of the rate of growth is much smaller than the propagation rate , @xmath19 .",
    "we will focus here on the limit case where the propagation is instantaneous : when a tree takes fire , the whole forest ( to which it belongs ) is destroyed immediately . the model is thus :    0.15 cm    @xmath15 vacant sites become occupied ( a seed falls and a tree immediately grows ) at rate @xmath16 ;    0.15 cm    @xmath15 matches fall on occupied sites at rate @xmath20 and then burn instantaneously the corresponding forest .",
    "0.15 cm    the features of the model depend on the geometry of the graph ; we only consider in this paper the case @xmath21 ( with its natural set of edges ) .",
    "they also depend on the laws of the processes governing seeds and matches ; the standard case is when these are poisson processes so that the forest fire process is markov .",
    "we deal here with the most general ( stationary ) case ; poisson processes are replaced by stationary renewal processes .",
    "0.15 cm    our main preoccupation is the behavior of this model in the asymptotic of rare seeds , namely when @xmath22 .",
    "we present four possible limit processes ( depending on the tail properties of the law of the stationary processes governing seeds ) arising when we suitably rescale space and accelerate time while letting @xmath22 .",

    "\\(v ) subsection [ intro5 ] is devoted to a brief exposition of the main ideas of the present paper .",
    "\\(vi ) finally , we give the plan of the paper in subsection [ intro6 ] .",
    "one of the successes of statistical mechanics is to explain how local interactions generate macroscopic effects through simple models on lattices . among the most striking phenomena",
    "are those observed around so - called _ critical values _ of the parameters of such models , such as scale - free patterns , power laws , conformal invariance , critical exponents or universality .",
    "0.15 cm      the study of self - organized critical systems has become rather popular in physics since the end of the 80 s .",
    "these are simple models supposed to clarify temporal and spatial randomness observed in a variety of natural phenomena showing _ long range correlations _ , like sand piles , avalanches , earthquakes , stock market crashes , forest fires , shapes of mountains , clouds , etc .",
    "it is remarkable that such phenomena reminiscent of critical behavior arise so frequently in nature where nobody is here to finely tune the parameters to critical values .",
    "0.15 cm    an idea proposed in 1987 by bak - tang - wiesenfeld @xcite to tackle this contradiction is , roughly , that of systems _ growing _ toward a _ critical state _ and relaxing through _ catastrophic _ events : avalanches , crashes , fires , etc .",
    "if the catastrophic events become more and more probable when approaching the critical state , the system spontaneously reaches an equilibrium _ close _ to the critical state .",
    "this idea was developed in @xcite through the study of the _ archetypical _ sand pile model .",
    "0.15 cm    this paradigm was used to investigate various phenomena , from physics to sociology through biology , epidemiology or economics .",
    "the pertinence of the conclusions are not always convincing .",
    "discussion to decide if whether or not there is self - organized criticality in nature or in one or another model , or even to decide what self - organized criticality should exactly be , is beyond our purpose .",
    "anyhow let us summarize the usual standard features of these models :    0.15 cm    @xmath15 local dynamics but with possibly very long range effects ( at high speed ) through a simple mechanism ; 0.15 cm    @xmath15 macroscopic states with scaling invariance properties , _ a priori _ related to the critical state of a well - known system;0.15 cm    @xmath15 long range spatial correlations and power laws for natural observables at fixed times;0.15 cm    @xmath15 presence of @xmath24-noise with @xmath25 in the temporal fluctuations of natural observables , i.e. @xmath26 of order @xmath24 where @xmath2 is the spectral density .",
    "0.15 cm    one of the specificities of these models is that the interaction is formally non local ; it is local in general , but may , when close to the _ critical region _",
    "whatever this means have long range effects .",
    "this , together with a lack of monotonicity , yields mathematical difficulties that justify a careful treatment .",
    "0.15 cm    to understand , explain or illustrate these phenomena , a multitude of models have been proposed to explore various mechanisms that would produce these effects .",
    "simple models , non necessarily realistic , are nice for they try to catch the underlying mechanisms .",
    "they have often been treated numerically , in the spirit of bak - tang - wiesenfield @xcite .",
    "forest fire models are among them and still need a mathematical rigorous study .",
    "sand pile models , while somehow more complicated , have been more studied .",
    "0.15 cm      let us explain in a few words what a sand pile model is .",
    "first , we assume that we have a definition of what a _ stable _ sand pile is .",
    "sand grains fall at random on sites .",
    "when a grain falls , if the new pile is _ unstable _ , it is immediately re - organized to become stable , through ( possibly many ) successive elementary steps .",
    "such events are called _",
    "avalanches_. this model was introduced by bak - tang - wiesenfeld @xcite and studied by dhar @xcite . since",
    ", there has been a huge amount of results and we will not try to be exhaustive ; for surveys see for instance holroyd - levine - meszaros - peres - propp - wilson @xcite , goles - latapy - magnien - morvan - phan @xcite or redig @xcite .",
    "0.15 cm    let us give a slightly more precise description of the so - called _ abelian _ sand pile model .",
    "the state of the system is described by @xmath27 , representing local _ slopes _ of the sand pile .",
    "for instance , when @xmath28 , think that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the height of the sand pile on the site @xmath9 .",
    "a dynamic is defined on @xmath31 using a matrix @xmath32 indexed by @xmath33 , called _ toppling matrix_. it has positive entries on the diagonal ( think of @xmath34 constant ) , negative entries when @xmath35 are neighbors and null entries elsewhere .",
    "it is _ dissipative _ if @xmath36 .",
    "then define the toppling of a site @xmath9 as the mapping @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 toppling at @xmath9 consists , whenever the slope is _ too big _ at @xmath9 , of spreading grains on neighboring sites ( possibly in a non conservative way ) .",
    "a pile is stable if for all @xmath10 , @xmath39 ( then , no toppling has any effect ) . observe that successive topplings at different sites commute ( which explains the term _ abelian _ ) .",
    "0.15 cm    now consider the situation where sand grains fall at random , on each site , at rate @xmath16 .",
    "each time a grain falls , immediately topple ( possibly many times ) until stability is reached .",
    "some dissipativity assumptions guarantee that this is always possible .",
    "0.15 cm    at first glance , arrival of a new sand grain on a site has only a local effect : a non trivial toppling at @xmath9 may occur .",
    "but there can be a chain reaction creating an avalanche . and",
    "indeed , the action may , in general , have a long range effect .",
    "0.15 cm    these systems have a nice underlying group structure that depends on the size and geometry of the underlying lattice , see e.g. le borgne - rossin @xcite for such an algebraic point of view .",
    "the thermodynamic limits of the sand - pile models have been investigated . in particular , existence and uniqueness of a stationary measure have been proved .",
    "see for instance maes - redig - saada @xcite when @xmath28 and jrai @xcite when @xmath40 .",
    "some features of self - organized criticality have been observed for @xmath41 , at least numerically , in the physical literature , see e.g. lbeck - usadel @xcite .",
    "for instance , they have studied the _ sizes of avalanches _ ( number of topplings necessary to stabilize after a grain has been added ) .",
    "a scaling limit was obtained recently by drre @xcite .",
    "0.15 cm      the abelian sand pile seems to be the most popular sand pile model .",
    "however it has a lot of variants : zhang sand pile model ( see zhang @xcite , pietronero - tartaglia - zhang @xcite ) , oslo model ( see christensen - corral - frette - feder - jossang @xcite , amaral - lauristsen @xcite ) , oslo rice pile model ( see brylawski @xcite ) , chip firing game ( see tardos @xcite ) , etc .",
    "0.15 cm    moreover , various different models have been introduced and studied with the eyes of self - organized criticality .",
    "there is of course the forest fire model that we are going to discuss in this paper .",
    "let us mention briefly some other models : rotor - router model ( introduced by priezzhev - dhar - dhar - krishnamurthy @xcite under the name _",
    "eulerian walkers model _ ) , loop - erased random walks ( majumdar @xcite ) , diffusion / aggregation models ( cafiero - pietronero - vespignani @xcite ) , scheidegger s model of river basin ( scheidegger @xcite ) , models describing earthquakes ( olami - feder - christensen @xcite ) or crashes in stock markets ( staufer - sornette @xcite ) , etc .",
    "0.15 cm    as we already mentioned those systems have often been subjected to numerical experimentations and studies .",
    "of course this is a difficult task and it has sometimes been misleading : long range effects need huge simulations , the interpretation of which is not always meaningful .",
    "0.15 cm    for surveys on self - organized criticality , see bak - tang - wiesenfeld @xcite , dhar @xcite , jensen @xcite and the references therein .      here",
    "we consider the classical forest fire model on @xmath1 .",
    "recall that on each site of @xmath2 , seeds are falling at rate @xmath16 and matches are falling at rate @xmath20 , according to some poisson processes .",
    "a seed falling on a vacant site makes it immediately occupied , and a match falling on an occupied site makes instantaneously vacant the whole corresponding occupied connected component .",
    "thus the forest fire process is markov ( at least if one is able to prove that it exists and is unique ) .",
    "0.15 cm      the forest fire model was introduced independently by henley @xcite and drossel - schwabl @xcite . in the literature ,",
    "it is generally referred to as the drossel - schwabl forest fire model . in their original paper , they consider the case where @xmath2 is a cube in @xmath42 .",
    "they are interested in scaling laws and critical exponents for this model .",
    "orders of magnitude of relevant quantities are derived by analytical computations using essentially mean field considerations .",
    "the results are _ confirmed _ by computer simulations . in drossel - clar - schwabl @xcite ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the density of vacant sites in the limit @xmath22 is obtained when @xmath28 ( using heuristic arguments , see subsubsection [ clusterssize ] below ) .",
    "after this work , numerous numerical or semi - analytical studies have been produced . among others ,",
    "let us mention henecker - peschel @xcite and pruessner - jensen @xcite .",
    "numerical studies were handled again by grassberger @xcite , who computes , when @xmath43 , the density of occupied sites , the fractal dimension of fires and the distribution of the fire sizes , in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "0.15 cm    the first rigorous probabilistic treatment of this model is the paper by van den berg and jrai @xcite .",
    "they give a rigorous description of the asymptotic density of vacant sites in the limit @xmath22 for the forest fire process on @xmath0 . to our knowledge , all the rigorous results about the forest fire process concern the case where seeds and matches fall according to poisson processes .",
    "see drre @xcite ( existence and uniqueness of the process on @xmath42 with @xmath17 fixed ) , van den berg - brouwer @xcite ( behavior of the process near the critical time in dimension @xmath44 , as @xmath22 ) and brouwer - pennanen @xcite ( estimates on the cluster size distribution in the asymptotic @xmath22 , in dimension @xmath16 ) .",
    "see also the papers by the authors @xcite ( study of the invariant distribution when @xmath45 in dimension @xmath16 ) and @xcite ( scaling limit of the one dimensional forest fire process in the asymptotic @xmath22 ) .",
    "we will discuss all these results more specifically in this introduction .",
    "0.15 cm      forest fires in real life are also a subject of preoccupation and of study from different point of views . in particular",
    "there are various statistical studies of sizes ( and sometimes shapes ) of _ real _ forest fires in different regions ( see for instance holmes - hugget - westerling @xcite )",
    ". one of the recurrent observations is that the distributions of those fires have heavy tails ( power laws ) and pleasant scale invariance properties .",
    "another one is the tentative description of the ( fractal ) geometry of fires ( see for instance mangiavillano @xcite ) . for references ,",
    "connection with real life and practical interest of these studies , see cui - perera @xcite .",
    "a few studies relate the dynamics of real fires in a given region with theoretical models .",
    "one natural task was to compare real data and numerical experiments done with the toy models we have . on this aspect ,",
    "let us mention the recent ( and encouraging ) works by zinck - grimm - johst @xcite .",
    "other studies focus on the propagation of the fire itself , but this is not our main preoccupation here since we have assumed that the propagation is instantaneous .",
    "0.15 cm    a direction of study suggested by works on real forest fires is to consider fires in _",
    "inhomogeneous _ , for instance _ random _ , media . to our knowledge",
    ", this aspect has not yet been investigated .",
    "another one , that we address here , is to consider the non markov case : seeds and matches may not ( and actually should not ) fall according to poisson processes .",
    "0.15 cm      the forest fire model has a very simple ( and natural ) dynamic .",
    "it may accept a variety of interpretations . and",
    "various modifications can make it fit the description of other phenomena .",
    "indeed , we initially thought of it as a simplification of the avalanche process : snow flakes fall on each site , a snow flake falling on a vacant site makes it occupied , and a snow flake falling on an occupied site makes vacant the whole connected component of occupied sites ( such an event being called _ avalanche _ ) .",
    "this is nothing but the forest fire process with @xmath45 , see @xcite .",
    "more generally , the forest fire process may be used to model phenomena involving geometric relations and a common behavior on connected components ; natural examples arise e.g. in epidemiology ( change _ fire _ by _ virus _ ) . from these points of view",
    ", some natural modifications could be explored such as making the growth process have effect only on sites which are neighbors of occupied sites ( in the spirit of the so - called contact process ) .",
    "such variants should be dominated by the standard contact process and by the forest fire process and may enjoy interesting features .",
    "0.15 cm    in a different spirit , a _ directed _ version of the forest fire model has been studied as a toy model for neural networks . roughly , the idea is to think of growth as _ activation _ and of fire as _ signal emission_. the signal is transmitted along the ( directed ) connected component which is at the same time deactivated .",
    "the difference is that the underlying graph is a directed graph ( usually a tree ) and that the signal is ( instantaneously ) sent according to the directed edge ( instead of all the connected component ) .",
    "let us mention the work of van den berg - brouwer @xcite , which include remarks about this model , and the work of van den berg - tth @xcite .",
    "0.15 cm      a slight change of point of view about the forest fire model makes explicit a parallel with a class of coagulation / fragmentation processes .",
    "assume e.g. that @xmath28 .",
    "say that each edge @xmath46 has mass @xmath16 , and that two neighbor edges @xmath47 and @xmath46 are connected ( or belong to the same particle ) if @xmath8 .",
    "then each time a seed falls on a vacant site , this glues two particles ( preserving the total mass ) . and",
    "each time a match falls on a site ( say , belonging to a forest containing @xmath48 sites ) , this breaks a particle of mass @xmath49 into @xmath49 particles with mass @xmath16 .",
    "0.15 cm    we used this remark in @xcite to study the evolution of the sizes of particles when neglecting correlation , using a deterministic coagulation - fragmentation equation .",
    "of course , similar considerations can be handled on any graph @xmath23 .",
    "0.15 cm      let us mention two recent results about one - dimensional forest fire processes with a somehow different flavor .",
    "0.15 cm    in @xcite , volkov considers a version of the forest fire process on @xmath50 where ignition occurs only at @xmath51 .",
    "he studies the weak limit of the distribution of the ( suitably normalized ) delay between to fires involving @xmath52 , as @xmath53 .",
    "0.15 cm    in @xcite , bertoin considers a modified version of knuth s parking model where random fires burn connected components of cars . on a circle of size @xmath52 ,",
    "cars arrive at each site at rate @xmath16 .",
    "when a car arrives , it occupies the first vacant site ( turning clockwise ) .",
    "molotov cocktails fall on each site at rate @xmath54 where @xmath55 is fixed .",
    "bertoin studies the asymptotic behavior of the saturation time as @xmath53 and observes a phase transition at @xmath56 .",
    "0.15 cm      as we already mentioned , one of the difficulties with forest fire models ( and with self - organized critical systems in general ) is that the interaction is not local .",
    "the process , whenever it is markov , is not feller and some classical results fail . in dimension one",
    ", this difficulty does not yield real problems for the questions of existence and uniqueness of the process .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that obviously , the sizes of the forests always remain finite ( even when @xmath20 is very small ) .",
    "this difficulty is more important in higher dimensions , because in the absence of fires , clusters would become infinite in finite time ( due to the fact that in dimension @xmath57 , percolation occurs ) .",
    "fires prevent us from the existence of infinite clusters , but precisely , these arbitrarily huge clusters burning make difficult the control of the range of interactions .",
    "this difficulty also makes the usual proof of existence of stationary measures using compactness arguments fail ( because indeed there is a lack of continuity ) .",
    "0.15 cm    the lack of monotonicity of these models , although not fundamental , makes the use of standard intuitions and techniques impossible .",
    "monotonicity allows one to compare the processes started from two different ordered initial configurations ( coupled in a suitable way ) .",
    "monotonicity can not hold here , because a configuration with more trees will burn sooner .",
    "the geometry of the underlying lattice is crucial in statistical mechanics .",
    "recall for instance that _ phase transition _ for the ising model on @xmath42 appears only for @xmath57 ( see velenik @xcite ) . for the forest fire models ,",
    "the influence of the geometry clearly comes through the behavior of the lattice with respect to percolation .",
    "this geometrical influence was already striking in numerical studies .",
    "0.15 cm      consider a graph @xmath1 .",
    "for all @xmath58 consider an i.i.d .",
    "family @xmath59 of bernoulli random variables with parameter @xmath60 ( a _ percolation trial _ with probability @xmath60 ) .",
    "it is well known that there is @xmath61 , depending on the graph , such that for all @xmath62 , there are a.s . no infinite connected components of occupied sites , while for @xmath63 , there is at least one infinite connected component with probability @xmath16 .",
    "the real number @xmath64 is called percolation threshold of @xmath23 .",
    "it is rather natural to consider ( dynamical ) _ percolation processes _ on @xmath23 , that are couplings of percolation trials for all @xmath58 .",
    "for instance , consider a family @xmath65 of i.i.d .",
    "random variables on @xmath66 with exponential distribution with parameter @xmath16 . put @xmath67 if @xmath68 and @xmath69 if @xmath70 .",
    "then for all @xmath71 , @xmath72 is a percolation trial with probability @xmath73 .",
    "thus an infinite cluster appears at time @xmath74 defined by @xmath75 .",
    "0.15 cm    it clearly appears that the percolation threshold plays a _",
    "crucial _ role in understanding the behavior of the forest fire process on a given lattice .",
    "the simple observation is that the _ growth process _ , i.e. without fires ( @xmath76 ) , is exactly a percolation process on the lattice . for @xmath20 small , and _ a fortiori _ for @xmath22 its study is a necessary preliminary .",
    "for instance , one aspect is the formation of infinite clusters ( although in general those clusters will never appear since , taking fires into account , they must burn before they become infinite ) .",
    "recall that the percolation threshold is @xmath16 in dimension @xmath16 .",
    "it is @xmath77 on @xmath42 and once there is an infinite cluster , there is a unique one . while , for instance on a @xmath78-regular tree , just after the percolation threshold , there are infinitely many infinite clusters : these situations are rather different and should yield different behaviors for the corresponding forest fire processes .",
    "observe that though , for @xmath20 small enough , the forest fire process is easy to define for small times , things turn out to be more complicated when we reach the _ critical time _",
    "@xmath74 . even in dimension",
    "@xmath16 the separate study of the percolation process makes sense as we shall see further , subsection [ kingman ] .",
    "0.15 cm      it has also been fruitful to study modified ( for instance dynamical ) versions of percolation processes .",
    "models like frozen percolation ( aldous @xcite , see also brouwer @xcite ) , invasion percolation ( see for instance vgvlgyi @xcite ) , or self - destructive percolation ( see van den berg - brouwer @xcite and more recently van den berg - brouwer - vgvlgyi @xcite ) are closely related to the forest fire processes .",
    "let us focus one moment on this last example since it has direct implications on forest fire processes .",
    "0.15 cm    a typical configuration for the self - destructive percolation model on @xmath79 with parameter @xmath80 is generated in three steps : first generate a configuration for the ordinary percolation model with parameter @xmath60 .",
    "next , make all sites in the infinite occupied cluster vacant . finally , make occupied each vacant site with probability @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath82 be the probability that @xmath51 belongs , in the final configuration , to an infinite occupied cluster .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , van den berg , brouwer and vgvlgyi prove that this function is continuous outside of a set of the form @xmath83 .",
    "it is conjectured that this function has a discontinuity , roughly meaning that there is @xmath84 such that for any @xmath63 , the model with parameter @xmath80 is sub - critical ( there a.s .",
    "is no infinite cluster ) .",
    "0.15 cm    in @xcite , van den berg and brouwer have proved that assumption of this conjecture yields a result for a @xmath44-dimensional forest fire process after the critical time : there is @xmath85 such that for all @xmath86 , @xmath87\\!]^2 $   burns before $ t$ } \\\\ \\hbox{in the   forest fire process on $ s_n=[\\![-n , n]\\!]^2 $ } \\end{array } \\right ] \\leq \\frac12.\\ ] ]    0.15 cm      the forest - fire process on a finite graph is a finite state space continuous time markov chain ( if matches and seeds fall according to poisson processes ) .",
    "existence and uniqueness of the process thus come for free .",
    "existence of an invariant measure as well .",
    "a basic argument also yields uniqueness of the invariant measure ( because the configuration with all sites vacant is recurrent ) .",
    "hence interesting phenomena may arise only when we let the size of the lattice tend to infinity .",
    "0.15 cm    when @xmath28 , it is not very expensive to go directly to the limit : the process is naturally uniquely defined on @xmath0 .",
    "this is easily seen through a graphical construction of the process ( see @xcite ) , see also proposition [ gcgff ] below .",
    "0.15 cm    in dimension @xmath88 the situation is more delicate . on @xmath42 ( and actually on any graph with bounded vertex degree ) existence has been proved recently by drre @xcite .",
    "he also proved uniqueness , but in two steps : firstly , in @xcite , he shows that , for @xmath17 large enough ( the bound is related to the percolation threshold ) , the forest - fire process is unique . only very recently the same author , in @xcite , tackled the same question on a graph with bounded vertex degree and for all @xmath17 .",
    "this is a much more subtle task . to prove this result he has to introduce the so - called blur processes , to show that the influence of matches falling far away from @xmath51 is negligible .",
    "0.15 cm      the mean field case is slightly different .",
    "indeed , one has to adopt the dual point of view ( on edges ) .",
    "furthermore , the process can not be defined directly on an infinite lattice since we consider the complete graph .",
    "the point of view developed by rth and tth in @xcite is based on the erds - reyni construction @xcite .",
    "for all @xmath89 , let @xmath90 be a set ( of vertices ) with @xmath91 , and consider the complete graph @xmath92 .",
    "start initially with all edges vacant .",
    "then edges appear independently at rate @xmath93 .",
