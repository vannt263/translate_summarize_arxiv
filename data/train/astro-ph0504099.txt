    "the core radius and the envelope slope represented by @xmath0 are important parameters to characterize the structure of the gas .    in simple models of structure formation by gravity ,",

    ", effects of radiative cooling can be a considerable factor .",
    "for instance , the cooling flows may increase the density of the cluster central region ( see @xcite for a review ) , though recent _ asca _ , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) show several results inconsistent with the standard cooling flow model . although various models have been proposed for thermal balance against cooling flows , ( see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite references therein ) , quantitative account is not yet given successfully .",
    "another factor of the double core may be the presence of a cd galaxy in the cluster central region ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the cores associated with cds seem small compared to the typical core size of the smaller core group ; for example , in the centaurus cluster , the core radius due to the cd is estimated to be @xmath12 40  kpc or less ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in the present paper , we investigate core structures of the isothermal intracluster gas .",
    "the origin of the two core sizes is of our interest . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we examine the @xmath0-model considering the isothermal x - ray temperature and the virial temperature . in section  [ sec : observation ] , we investigate 121 clusters observed by _ rosat _ and _ asca _ and discuss the properties of the smaller and larger core clusters . in section  [ sec : simulation ] , we show the results of hydrodynamical calculations to simulate the @xmath0-model or the behavior of the isothermal gas under the cluster potential , and discuss the effect of a central cd galaxy .",

    "therefore , it is unlikely that x - ray asymmetry is characteristic to small core clusters .      in the cores of some clusters , the gas undergoes significant radiative cooling , and",

    "these may suggest that the clusters of small cores are affected by radiative cooling after the self - similar collapse .",
    "also cds or galaxies in the central region can alter the core structure through their agn activities , supernovae feedback or galactic winds .",
    "however , as discussed in section 3.2 , the difference in the relation with such galaxies is not clear between the smaller and larger core groups as compared to the relation with the cooling time .",
    "moreover , heat or pressure due to such activities of central galaxies likely works against the core getting smaller , while the relevant metal enrichment enhances radiative cooling .",
    "if the gas - mass fraction in the cooling core is nearly constant among the clusters , a scaling law follows the self - similarity @xmath101 , as ( see section  [ sec : theory ] and equation  ( [ eq : ng0 ] ) ) @xmath102 this dependence is seen in figure  [ fig:6]b for the clusters of the larger core group . for large core clusters of @xmath103 , radiative cooling is not yet significant and their cores remain to follow the self - similar relation .",

    "3 .   the 121 clusters can be classified by the core size into two groups , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "no clear correlation is seen between @xmath15 and @xmath20 for the small core ( @xmath12 4080  kpc ) clusters , while the self - similarity @xmath79 is attained marginally for the larger core ( @xmath12 140300  kpc ) clusters .",
    "neither clear relation with cd galaxy is found for the small core clusters .",
    "it is found , however , that the small core clusters have cooling time significantly shorter than the hubble time , while the larger core clusters have longer cooling time .",
    "these suggest that radiative cooling in the core may be responsible for the small cores or breaking the self - similarity @xmath79 , which is expected from the collapse and seen in the larger core clusters .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations of the isothermal gas in clusters , which consist of the dark matter , galaxies and gas , show the self - similar relation @xmath79 and @xmath168 consistently with our analysis of the @xmath0-model ( section  [ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "calculations also show that a large cd galaxy located in the cluster center affects the gas profile within the region @xmath169  kpc .",
    "thus , under the presence of a central cd galaxy , the intracluster gas may be represented better by the double @xmath0-model than the single one .",
    ".   however , the inner core ( @xmath8  kpc ) due to the cd galaxy is too small to account for the core - size distribution of the smaller core group .",
    "finally , from the analysis of the 121 clusters as well , it is unlikely that the origin of the smaller cores is explained by the presence of a central cd galaxy .",
