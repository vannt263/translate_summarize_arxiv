    "since their discovery in the late 1970s  @xcite , scientists have proposed a growing number of progenitors and engines for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the variety in the observations of classical grbs points to multiple progenitor scenarios . based on their duration",
    ", bursts are traditionally separated in long and short grbs  @xcite . within the black hole accretion disk ( bhad ) class of models ,",
    "long - duration bursts are believed to arise from accreting black holes at the center of massive stars , e.g. from collapsars  @xcite or he - mergers  @xcite .",
    "short - duration bursts are believed to be produced by the merger of two compact objects : consisting either of a binary neutron star ( ns - ns ) or a neutron star and a black hole ( bh - ns ) : for review see , for example , @xcite .",
    "these compact mergers are produced in close binaries and the kicks imparted onto these compact remnants cause these systems to have high space velocities .",
    "these velocities , coupled with merger times , mean that bursts produced from ns - ns and bh - ns binaries should have broad spatial distributions with respect to their host galaxy , including bursts that occur well outside of their host  @xcite . with swift , the number of localized short - duration bursts has increased dramatically , and the observed spatial distributions of these bursts matches the predictions from theory  @xcite .",
    "indeed , no other model to date can easily explain the spatial distributions of short - duration bursts , and ns - ns and bh - ns mergers are almost universally considered the leading progenitors for these bursts .",
    "the bhad engine is not the only way accreting compact objects can produce possible outflows .",
    "neutron stars are also able to accrete at super - eddington rates  @xcite and ns accretion disk ( nsad ) systems will look very similar to bhad engines . alternatively , building off of the leading mechanism for soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) , theorists have argued that rapidly - spinning magnetars  @xcite can produce classical grbs  @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the neutron star models is that they  as long as the merger remnant is stable  can drive strong baryonic winds via neutrino energy deposition @xcite that potentially choke the grb jet  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the neutron star model is that the ns can be born with strong magnetic fields and these magnetars provide a means to drive late - time emission  @xcite .",
    "understanding the relative rate of merging systems that form black holes versus neutron stars can help direct theorists toward a better understanding of these systems .",
    "for example , if very few systems collapse to form black holes , either the baryonic loading problem is less severe than currently believed or mergers are not the solution to grbs . on the other extreme ,",
    "if only a small fraction remain neutron stars , it is worth identifying and trying to observe the failed grbs formed by these systems .",
    "observations of relative rates of these systems can provide a fairly direct means to constrain the nuclear equation of state .",
    "this paper brings together studies of binary neutron star merger models , nuclear equations of state , and population synthesis models to study the formation rate of different potential grb progenitors , differentiating between black hole accretion disk models , accretion - induced collapse models , and neutron star accretion models .",
    "section  [ sec : mergermodels ] describes the merger models used in this study and section  [ sec : eos ] describes the effects and uncertainties in the equation of state ( eos ) . by coupling these results with population synthesis studies",
    ", we can compare these results to the suite of grb observations ( section  [ sec : popsynth ] ) .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results on the wide range of phenomena explained by ns - ns and bh - ns binaries .",
    "in the past decade , the number of hydrodynamic simulations of ns - ns and bh - ns mergers has grown considerably@xcite .",
    "although these models are becoming increasingly sophisticated , most of the current models include only a subset of the physics needed to model these objects : hydrodynamics , neutrino transport ( or at least neutrino energy losses ) , nuclear equations of state , magnetic fields , and general relativity .",
    "nevertheless , these models are gradually painting a complete picture of the merger process and we can use them to make a first pass at the fate of these systems .      to date , no bh - ns system has been observed and , at this point , there are no observations that would require such systems to exist . however , there are clear observational biases against such systems : if the ns is formed after the black hole , as we expect , it is difficult to recycle it",
    ". hence we do not expect a millisecond pulsar in bh - ns binaries .",
    "population synthesis models predict that these systems form frequently and many of them close enough to merge within a hubble time .",
    "theoretical models for massive star evolution and the formation of bh - ns systems suffer from large uncertainties ( e.g. , treatment of star internal mixing , stellar winds , common envelope and supernova explosion ) .",
    "population synthesis models predict a range of formation rates from several orders of magnitude below the bns merger rate to rates that rival the bns rate  @xcite .",
    "the binary parameters of bh - ns systems are crucial for the outcome of the merger and only for a fraction of the parameter space will it be possible to form an accretion disk massive enough to launch a grb .",
    "if we assume the energy arises from the disk , @xmath0 can be extrated , so that the disks do not need to be extremely massive to accomodate the typical isotropic gamma - ray energies of short bursts  @xcite of @xmath1 erg ( and correspondingly lower if they are collimated ) .",
    "if the energy arises from the rotating black hole , significantly smaller disk masses are needed to produce the energies required for short bursts  @xcite . nevertheless , not all systems will be able to form disks , since the radius where tidal disruption sets in , @xmath2 , must be larger than the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , @xmath3 . since @xmath4 , but @xmath5 , for massive enough black holes the tidal radius lies inside of the isco and forming a massive accretion disk becomes impossible . for a non - spinning black hole",
    "this occurs already near @xmath6 m@xmath7 , so that bhs of the masses that are thought  @xcite to be most likely ( @xmath8 m@xmath7 ) need large dimensionless spin parameters , @xmath9 , to form sizeable disks @xcite . finally , the inclination of vector of bh - ns orbital angular momentum to bh spin vector plays an important role in the formation of a torus . at large inclination angles ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "material from the disrupted ns is ejected from the vicinity of a merger and does not form torus .",
    "non - zero tilts are expected in bh - ns systems if a ns is formed as a second compact object in a binary and with a non - zero natal kick in isolated binary evolution in field populations  @xcite and , in majority of cases , in dynamical evolution ; e.g. , globular clusters@xcite .",
    "the number of simulations studying these mergers and their fates has grown with time @xcite , all showing that the final fate of the merged system depends sensitively upon the initial conditions .",
    "based on earlier merging bh - ns models by @xcite , it was shown for one particular evolutionary model that only a fraction of bh - ns systems may potentially form an accretion torus and lead to a grb . for small bh spins ( @xmath11 ) , only 1% of bh - ns mergers were found to have a disk needed to produce a grb .",
    "for high bh spins the fraction of systems with disks have been calculated to be @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "it is important , that in future studies , the merger hydrodynamical simulations are mapped with astrophysically - motivated predictions of bh - ns system physical properties .    for this paper , we will assume the grb rate is dominated by bns mergers , but we will return to the topic of bh - ns mergers when we better understand the bns results .",
    "ns - ns mergers always form sizable accretion disks and aare the more canonical grb model .",
    "the primary difficulty with these mergers as grb progenitors is the nature of the merged core .",
    "after the merger , the remnant will evolve according to four separate pathways : collapse directly to black holes , those that initially form nss but subsequently collapse during disk accretion , those that do nt collapse to black holes until after the disk has fully accreted and the newly formed neutron star spins down , and those that , even after the spin down , remain a ns . to determine the fate of each merged object",
    ", we must combine both simulations of the merger process ( discussed in this section ) with our current understanding of the nuclear equation of state ( see section  [ sec : eos ] ) . for two equally - massed neutron stars , the merger produces a condensed core consisting of two major components formed from the cores of the initial neutron stars . as the mass ratio becomes more extreme , the more massive neutron star remains more intact , disrupting its companion . in all cases",
    ", the merger produces a merged core surrounded by a dense accretion disk with a small amount of material ( @xmath131% ) ejected during the tidal ejection process .    to study the fates of neutron stars , we use the large grid of smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations from @xcite .",
    "this grid of models includes a broad suite of neutron star mass pairs using the same input physics . for each simulation",
    ", we calculate the mass and angular momentum of the merged core ( all material above @xmath14 ) , disk masses ( bound mass with densities below @xmath15 ) and ejecta masses ( table  [ tab : merger ] ) .    at the end of the smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations , considerable mass ( @xmath16 )",
    "remains bound but at densities below @xmath15 . in table",
    "[ tab : merger ] , we refer to this material as `` disk '' material and much of it will form a disk that quickly accretes onto the compact core . if the core collapses to a black hole , the system immediately evolves into a bhad engine . if not , it may first pass through a neutron star accretion disk or magnetar engine until the accretion drives the neutron star above the maximum mass and it collapses , producing a bhad scenario .    whether or not the core is a black hole or neutron star depends upon whether it is more massive than the maximum neutron star mass at its spin rate .",
    "this depends upon the still - uncertain equation of state .",
    "recent observations by @xcite and @xcite demonstrate that this mass is least 2m@xmath7 .",
    "the exact value for the maximum mass of a particular merged core depends on the equation of state as well as the internal energy and angular momentum distribution in the core .",
    "our choice of equation of state will determine which merged cores collapse immediately to a black hole .",
    "in other cases , the core must accrete some material before it collapses . to determine the engine behind this neutron star",
    ", we must understand the accretion timescale .",
    "if the core remains a neutron star for a long period of time , the neutrino - driven wind will choke the outflow , preventing a strong burst  @xcite . to estimate the accretion time of the disk",
    ", we use the matter distribution from our models and assume an @xmath17-driven disk scenario .",
    "that is , for the spatial distribution of the disk material , we assume the accretion timescale is just the orbital period divided by the value of @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spatial position of the matter , @xmath20 is the enclosed mass and @xmath17 is the viscous disk parameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : acc ] shows the mass of the core as a function of time under our @xmath17-disk assumptions using @xmath21 .",
    "note that although much of the accretion occurs in the first 100ms , the accretion phase can last out to a few seconds for some systems .",
    "clearly , the accretion time depends linearly on the value for @xmath17 whose value is uncertain to an order of magnitude .",
    "-disk solution for the accretion time .",
    "note that in many systems , the accretion occurs very rapidly ( in the first 10,ms ) and can last out to a few seconds .",
    "the jumps occur because the angular momentum of material is not uniform and large amounts of material have similar angular momenta , and hence , accretion timescales . ]    for the most part , these models assume that the neutron stars in the binary are initially not spinning ( although for one case , we include a neutron star binaries in co - rotation ) .",
    "the assumption is well - justified since the last inspiral stages happen so quickly that even an unplausibly large dissipation can not spin up the stars substantially  @xcite .",
    "pre - merger spins are typically substantially smaller than co - rotation , but even in the co - rotation case , the mass is altered by only a few percent , but the angular momentum in the core can change by 15% .",
    "this has only a small affect on the maximum stable neutron star mass of the core , but it can dramatically change the accretion rate ( see section  [ sec : eos ] ) .",
    "be aware that the current set of simulations are incomplete , missing both physics and spatial resolution to model the physics . as this physics",
    "is improved , exact quantities on merged cores , etc . will move .",
    "but the basic trends will continue and , although there may be a shift in our results , the trends and methodology to study ns - ns and bh - ns mergers the results will remain .",
    "the fate of the core depends on the exact details of the equation of state .",
    "if the maximum neutron star mass were 2.0m@xmath7 , the maximum observed neutron star mass  @xcite , most of our merger cases would immediately collapse to a black hole .",
    "this observation only places a lower limit on the maximum mass , and the maximum mass of a cold neutron star may , depending upon the equation of state , be much higher than this maximum observed mass .",
    "in addition , fast - rotation and thermal energy can significantly raise the maximum mass . to determine the final fate of our merger remnants",
    ", we will study the maximum mass , and its dependence on the spin and internal energy , for a range of equation of state models .",
    "the merged core , especially if the components are near - equal mass , are often born with strong differential rotation  @xcite . depending upon the magnetic field strength , these cores will very quickly evolve into uniform rotation .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that a combination of magnetic winding , shearing and the magnetorotational instability can quickly redistribute the angular momentum in an accreting disk system . for a few of our fastest rotating mergers ( the merger of a 2.0m@xmath7 ns with a 1.0,1.2m@xmath7 ns and the merger of a 1.8 m@xmath7 ns with a 1.0m@xmath7 ns : see table  [ tab : merger ] ) , secular instabilities can develop that will also redistribute the angular momentum .",
    "finally , neutrino cooling in the core will drive convection in the core  @xcite that can redistribute the angular momentum .",
    "these redistribution mechanisms have timescales lying between 10 - 100ms .",
    "if it is at the low end , our assumption that it is nearly instantaneous holds . if there is a longer delay in this evolution to uniform rotation , the maximum mass could remain high for longer , producing more long - lived neutron star systems .",
    "note , however , that for our population study ( see section  [ sec : popsynth ] ) , only @xmath22% of our systems have a ns component with masses above 1.8 m@xmath7 and none of our @xmath23 systems included pairs with a massive component above 1.8 m@xmath7 and a low mass component below 1.2 m@xmath7 , so the highest angular momentum systems are extremely rare .",
    "although a multitude of dense matter equations of state ( eos ) exist which make firm predictions about maximum masses , see for example , @xcite , all of them make simplifying assumptions for the physics and theory can not place strong constraints on the final maximum mass .",
    "most models for the neutron star equation of state predict masses in a range between 2.0 and 3.0m@xmath7 , uncertainties in nuclear physics prevent a more precise prediction of the maximum mass for a non - rotating model .",
    "however , for a model with a given maximum non - rotating mass , we can predict the effect of thermal energy and angular momentum .    for our study",
    ", we use a variety of equations of state to probe the fate of our merged cores .",
    "these include , inparticular , the nl3@xcite and fsu2.1  @xcite eoss .",
    "we also include one of the equation of state models developed in  @xcite where the model parameters are matched to observations of quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries and photospheric radius expansion bursts  @xcite using a monte carlo scheme to perform marginal estimation  @xcite . in this equation of state model ,",
    "matter near and below the nuclear saturation density is described by a parameterization calibrated to the properties of laboratory nuclei and quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite . at higher densities ,",
    "matter is described by two piecewise polytropes .",
    "the rns code for rotating neutron stars from @xcite was embedded in our monte carlo simulation to output probability distributions for the maximum mass of a neutron star given a fixed angular momentum .    during the merger , shocks and viscous forces increase the energy in the core , raising the entropy .",
    "this extra thermal energy can raise the maximum neutron star mass  @xcite .",
    "most studies where this has been a large effect have assumed entropies of roughly 8@xmath24 per nucleon . however , actual estimates of the post - merger entropies used in our study  @xcite lie at about 1@xmath24 per nucleon ( table  [ tab : merger ] ) . using the nl3@xcite equation of state ( fairly typical )",
    "an entropy of 1.28@xmath24 per nucleon raises the maximum stable mass by only 1% . in this scenario ,",
    "the internal energy deposited in the core in the merged system is not sufficient to strongly affect the maximum neutron star mass .",
    "there is more thermal energy in the surrounding disk , but its low densities allow efficient neutrino cooling that is on par with the accretion time .",
    "hence , we will use the accretion time to estimate our collapse rate for systems that collapse after accretion .",
    "the angular momentum in the merged core can , however , have a larger impact on the maximum neutron star mass . if we assume the core quickly evolves into a system in solid body rotation , we can use existing equations of state to estimate the maximum neutron star mass for these rotating systems . for the fsu2.1 equation of state , we find that the maximum neutron star mass increases nearly linearly with rotational support over the range of rotations produced in neutron star mergers ( fig .  [",
    "fig : shen ] ) . as input for our population studies",
    ", we have fit the maximum neutron star mass predicted for this equation of state with the following linear approximation : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the rotational angular momentum of the compact core .",

    "this angular momentum can drastically distort the neutron star .",
    "the ratio of the polar to equatorial radii ( assuming solid - body rotation ) is also shown as a function of angular momentum . at the end of our simulations ,",
    "the core structure has not yet reached solid body rotation , and the asphericity is even more extreme ( possibly arguing for a more extreme maximum mass ) . ]",
    "thus far we have only used specific equations of state . to determine the role of angular momentum change with a broad range of allowed nuclear equations of state",
    ", we use our parameterized equation of state .",
    "the increase in the mass ( @xmath27 ) of a maximally - rotating neutron star depends upon the maximum mass of the non - rotating neutron star .",

    "the @xmath27 for a maximally rotating neutron star increases for equations of state that have larger maximum non - rotating stars .",
    "however , for the angular momenta in our merged cores , the increase in the maximum mass is much less dramatic .",
    "a fit to these lower - angular momentum systems yields the following result for the maximum rotating neutron star mass : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the maximum mass for a non - rotating neutron star . for this paper",
    ", we study different values of @xmath34 , fitting the change in mass to average values of rotating systems for a range of angular momenta from @xmath35 based on the angular momenta in the cores in our simulations ( table  [ tab : merger ] ) . for @xmath36 ,",
    "the values for @xmath37 and @xmath38 are : @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . typically , rotation adds less than a few tenths of a solar mass to our maximun mass of our merged cores .",
    "accretion of the disk material can also alter the angular momentum of the core , but how much angular momentum depends upon the exact accretion process ( including magnetic field strength ) .",
    "for this study , we assume the specific angular momentum is held constant during the accretion phase .",
    "moreover , we assume that the post - merger magnetic fields are small enough ( @xmath41 g ) to not contribute noticeably to the pressure . to obtain a more detailed survey of the possible merger fates",
    ", we created a grid of maximum masses , varying @xmath34 from 2.0 to 2.5 with constant values for @xmath37 ( @xmath42m@xmath7 ) and @xmath38 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "as a function of the maximum non - rotating mass .",

    "here we use the four fates discussed in section  [ sec : nsns ] : bh , bh@xmath44 , bh@xmath45 , ns .",
    "note that for these fates , our equation of state models assume that the neutron star has reached an equilibrium density state and it is in solid body rotation .",
    "the rotating object is differentially rotating through this period but our simplified assumptions provide an estimate of the importance of spin in the final fate .",
    "spin may prevent an immediate collapse to a black hole but , in most cases , the accretion of the surrounding material is sufficient to cause the core to collapse with or without rotation ( see table  [ tab : nsfate ] ) .",
    "to compare these results to observations , we must incorporate our findings into a study of the binary neutron star and neutron star / black hole populations .",

    "the primary uncertainty in our calculation is the lower limit on the neutron star formation mass . for our lower",
    "ns formation limit of 1.1m@xmath7 , the steiner2.4 ( maximum non - rotating neutron star mass of 2.4m@xmath7 ) marks the transition between mostly bh final states vs. mostly ns final states . if the mass is increased by 0.1m@xmath7 , the steiner2.5 marks this transition .",
    "more importantly for our analysis is the transition eos for systems that form bhs in less than 100ms . for these systems , the transition is steiner2.2 , steiner2.3 respectively for our two mass limits .",
    "the other population synthesis parameters do not produce much variation in these results .",
    "in our analysis , we found that the fate of the merged system depends sensitively on the neutron star equation of state .",
    "figure  [ fig : sum ] shows the fraction of rapid ( @xmath74ms ) and immediate collapse black holes as a function of the equation of state .",
    "if we can observationally distinguish between these fates , we can use ns - ns mergers to place constraints on the equation of state .",
    "( bhad - dashed , ns - long - dashed ) for old ( red ) and new ( magenta ) initial orbital conditions .",
    "the orbital conditions have virtually no effect on these results and the variations caused by other binary population synthesis parameters is also negligible .",
    "the primary error in these estimates is that of the initial mass distribution of neutron stars , producing an equivalent error in the maximum non - rotating ns mass limit on the eos . ]    for example , the current favored model for short - duration grbs is the merger of two neutron stars forming a black hole accretion disk . if the merged core forms a neutron star , neutrino - driven winds  @xcite drive outflows through which any jet must penetrate to produce a gamma - ray burst .",
    "current studies argue that this well - known baryon contamination problem can only be avoided if the neutron star phase lasts less than @xmath75ms  @xcite .",
    "if this is true , grbs are produced in only a fraction of all merging systems .",
    "if the maximum mass is below 2.3 - 2.4 m@xmath7 , then the cores of most neutron star mergers produce black holes within @xmath76ms of the merger . for these equations of state ,",
    "most neutron star mergers are capable of forming short - duration grbs .    above a maximum non - rotating neutron star mass of 2.3 - 2.4 m@xmath7 ,",
    "less than 4% of all mergers produce rapid - collapse black hole systems within 100ms .",
    "if only such black hole systems form short - duration grbs , this would require a rate of mergers that is 50 times higher than cannonical values . although possible , this strains our current understanding of binary and stellar evolution , arguing strongly that the maximum neutron star mass is below 2.3 - 2.4 m@xmath7 .",
    "advanced ligo will be able to place more stringent constraints on this merger rate , and this measured merger rate will provide more firm constraints on the maximum neutron star mass .    unfortunately , constraining the ns - ns merger rate and its comparison with short grb rates may not directly constrain the equation of state .",
    "bh - ns mergers can also produce short - duration grbs and , in a small subset of binary population synthesis scenarios , bh - ns merger rate is on par with the ns - ns merger rate , e.g.@xcite .",
    "although it is possible to construct a scenario where bh - ns mergers dominate the rate of ns - ns mergers , recall from section 2.1 that it is likely that most of bh - ns systems do not produce disks of sufficient size to make grbs  @xcite .",
    "if the connection between the short grbs and bh - ns mergers could be established , it will place strong constraints on binary population synthesis models ( in most scenarios , the ns - ns merger rate is an order of magnitude higher than the bh - ns merger rate ; @xcite . it will also point to the eos with maximum ns mass over 2.3 - 2.4m@xmath7 as such eos allows to eliminate the formation of short grbs from ns - ns mergers via most accepted ( bhad ) engine model .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the baryon loading from neutrino - driven winds from neutron stars does not preclude the possibility that cores that remain neutron stars can produce grbs .",
    "late - time emission from short - duration grbs either argues for some extended power source ( e.g. late - time accretion , magnetar ) or jet interaction@xcite .",
    "the magnetar power source requires a long - lived neutron star and has been shown , within the free parameters of the magnetar model  @xcite , to fit the late - time emission well .",
    "proponents of the magnetar model argue that there must be some way to avoid the burying of the magnetic field and the baryon loading , e.g. a high pressure , magnetic or radiation dominated , region along the axis prevents baryon loading and allows the production of a relativistic jet .    to rule out these alternative solutions , we either need to refine our theoretical models to prove the differences in the current interpretations or we need additional observational diagnostics to distinguish the above picture . for example , it might be possible to distinguish bh from ns formation using the gravitational wave signal  @xcite , but this will likely require a very strong signal from a nearby merger . if a stable neutron star with strong magnetic fields is formed , we would expect continued pulsar - like activity , e.g. a soft gamma - ray repeater . however , if we only have ligo localizations , it will be difficult to prove the association of any activity with the merger , e.g.@xcite .",
    "the ejecta from these models could allow us to distinguish these models .",
    "the optical / infra - red light produced by the decay of radioactive elements can be used to distinguish between ns and bh fates .",
    "the masses of the dynamic ejecta that are shown in figure  [ fig : ejecta ] ) do not vary dramatically in our models and , without alteration by the core , the extreme neutron - richness of these ejecta leads to a composition that almost exclusively consists of very massive nuclei with very large opacities  @xcite producing transients peaking in the near - infrared ( or infrared )  @xcite .",
    "however , the transient observed post - merger is composed of emission produced by a combination of this dynamic ejecta , neutrino driven winds from the core ( if the core does not collapse to a black hole ) and ejecta from the disk accretion . due to the longer exposure to the intense neutrino background , the neutron fraction is reduced , altering the composition of these ejecta and the revised opacities may allow brighter transients in the near - infrared and optical@xcite . since this ejecta is much larger for ns systems than bh disk systems@xcite , we may be able to distinguish these two systems by the wavelength of their electromagnetic emission",
    "if so , we can use observations of neutron star mergers to place constraints on dense matter equations of state .",
