    "the problem of stabilizing string moduli ( for example , the compactification volume ) is a non - trivial one . this problem is exemplified in the famous paper of dine and seiberg  @xcite . in the perturbative region of moduli space ,",
    "the khler potential for a modulus field @xmath0 typically vanishes or approaches a finite constant value in the @xmath1 limit .",
    "if the field @xmath0 is the volume modulus , this corresponds to decompactification of the extra dimensions . in a time",
    "- dependent , cosmological setting , this problem is known as the brustein - steinhardt problem  @xcite . depending on the initial conditions ,",
    "the field @xmath0 can acquire a large amount of kinetic energy and can easily overshoot any local minima in the potential , causing new dimensions of space to open up .",
    "hence , in order to create a phenomenologically acceptable cosmology , it is necessary to provide a mechanism to lower the field gently into a local minimum of the potential , in which it can remain for an observationally acceptable length of time ( i.e. , longer than the hubble time @xmath2 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we provide such a mechanism within the context of a cosmology sourced by a gas of brane winding modes .",
    "such an initial state is common to the brane gas picture of string cosmology , developed in  @xcite . in particular , we make use of the fact that the energy density in branes winding around compact dimensions redshifts more slowly than the kinetic energy of a typical khler ( volume ) modulus .",
    "friction , generated by cosmic expansion , causes the modulus kinetic energy to dissipate rapidly  @xcite .",
    "a period of brane domination then helps the field to settle into a local minimum of the potential .",
    "our example appears to be a simple realization of a general phenomenon discussed in  @xcite and more recently in  @xcite .",
    "our specific example involves a three dimensional expanding universe with energy density composed primarily of modulus energy , and that of string and membrane winding modes .",
    "however , the mechanism is quite generic and may be applied to a large number of situations ; for example , when a hierarchy in the sizes of extra - dimensions is present  .",
    "we argue that this mechanism may be useful in formulating a brane gas cosmology on phenomenologically realistic compactification manifolds of non - trivial holonomy , such as calabi - yau spaces .",
    "an intriguing cosmological scenario naturally arises within our basic setup .",
    "if wrapped co - dimension - one branes are present in the early universe , they will quickly come to dominate cosmological dynamics . in the @xmath3 dimensional expanding spacetime ,",
    "these branes manifest themselves as domain walls and lead to a period of cosmic inflation  @xcite .",
    "the inflationary period has a natural graceful exit mechanism and can last long enough to solve the horizon and flatness problems of the standard big - bang model , provided that the ratio of the string scale to the fundamental scale is sufficiently large .",
    "while this is attractive , we should point out that our scenario suffers from a domain wall problem , and is not capable , at present , of explaining the observed density fluctuations and microwave anisotropies , since the spectral index deviates significantly from the scale invariant one , @xmath4 .",
    "we speculate on possible solutions to these problems in our conclusions .",
    "in phenomenologically realistic string inspired models , the effective theory below the planck scale is typically described by a weakly - coupled , four - dimensional , @xmath5 supergravity theory .",
    "the effective action is , therefore , invariant and described by a real potential @xmath6 , and a holomorphic superpotential @xmath7 , with lagrangian density    [ act1 ] & = & _ i , j k__i,|_j _ i |_j + & - & e^k ( _ i , j k^_i,|_j(d__iw)(d_|_jw)^ -3 |w|^2 ) . where the sum is over complex - valued , chiral superfields @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "focusing on the case when all but one of the moduli ( say @xmath10 ) are fixed ( as in the model of kachru , kallosh , linde and trivedi ( kklt ) @xcite , the potential v = e^k , has a superpotential of the form w ( ) = w_0 + a e^-a , [ supv ] where @xmath11 is a tree - level contribution arising from fluxes and @xmath12 is the single free , light modulus field .",

    "the branes behave as ordinary relativistic matter , with equation of state @xmath17 .",
    "however , in the non - relativistic limit ( wrapped branes with @xmath18 ) the equation of state becomes @xmath19 .",
    "we take as our ansatz a flat ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21-dimensional , friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , with metric [ frw ] ds^2 = -dt^2+a^2(t)_i=1^d dx_i^2 , where @xmath22 is the scale factor .",

    "matter sources , obeying equation of state @xmath29 , will redshift in the expanding space as ~a^-d(1+w ) , so that wrapped @xmath13-branes with @xmath30 , satisfy _ wrapping~a^-(d - p ) , [ rdsft ] while the kinetic energy of the @xmath31 field obeys _",
    "~a^-2d , hence , kinetic energy always redshifts more rapidly than other matter sources . with sufficient cosmic friction this dissipation of the modulus kinetic energy can allow the field to be placed gently into the shallow minimum of its potential",
    "of course , if other matter sources are not present in sufficient quantities , it is possible for @xmath32 to overshoot the minimum at @xmath33 and to run off to infinity .",
    "the authors of @xcite , explicitly showed that radiation can be used to slow down the modulus and lower it into the minimum of the potential . while radiation redshifts as @xmath34 , from ( [ rdsft ] ) we see that string and brane winding gases redshift much more slowly , as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "this means that wall and string gases will be more efficient in stabilizing the modulus field than radiation . for radiation",
    "the scale factor evolves as @xmath37 , whereas for wrapped membranes , @xmath38 ( see eq .",
    "( [ sfev ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the hubble damping term in ( [ seom ] ) will be more significant for walls ( and wrapped strings ) than radiation .",
    "in the following example we take @xmath39 .",
    "it is clear from @xmath40 , that the field @xmath12 has a non - standard kinetic term . for our purposes",
    "it is convenient to switch to a canonically normalized field @xmath31 , with equation of motion + dh+v()=0 , [ seom ] where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the field @xmath32 . specializing to @xmath39",

    "in our scenario the universe experiences several possible distinct epochs , depending on the initial relative energy densities of the matter sources .",
    "the earliest epoch is potential energy dominated .",

    "> from ( [ sasha ] ) , it is clear that the modulus field will grow large if there is nothing to stop it . however , when brane winding modes are present , the kinetic energy , which redshifts very quickly ( as @xmath49 ) , dissipates due to the cosmic friction generated by the presence of the string and wall gases .",
    "assuming such sources exist in sufficient quantities , the modulus field can now be fixed .",
    "the universe becomes dominated by the energy of the brane sources and , depending on the relative initial densities of strings and walls , several possibilities can arise .",
    "if the initial energy densities of all matter components are of comparable orders of magnitude then , when kinetic energy domination ends , if walls are present , they will almost always dominate over the other components .",
    "an interesting possibility ( although requiring some fine tuning ) is the case in which all forms of energy densities are allowed to dominate for a short time .",
    "since this is the most intricate possibility , we will examine such a case numerically in the following section .",
    "for the numerical analysis we wish to solve ( [ aeom ] ) together with ( [ seom ] ) and we take initial conditions subject to the constraint equation ( [ fried ] )  ) together with ( [ seom ] ) . ] . throughout",

    "( [ cmh.eps ] ) .",
    "= 3.5 in    three difficult obstacles remain .",
    "the first is a generalized domain wall problem .",
    "since the membranes cause the universe to expand as @xmath81 , rather than like radiation with @xmath82 , a wall dominated period would drastically affect the abundance of light elements produced during nucleosynthesis . besides this , if today even one wall ( with a tension @xmath83 the electroweak scale ) were present , it would overclose the universe . thus",
    ", a universe containing walls must get rid of them eventually .",
    "a second , possibly related problem , is how to reheat the universe after the wall dominated period , in order to enter into a hot , radiation dominated universe .",
    "finally , it seems very unlikely that a wall accelerated universe can produce the observed density fluctuations and microwave anisotropies , since the scalar index for wall inflation is given by n_s-1=- , where @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , walls in @xmath39 give @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "this deviates significantly from the observed value ( e.g. , from wmapext + 2df ) of @xmath86 ( @xmath87 confidence level )  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that wrapped brane and/or string gases in the early universe provide an efficient mechanism for resolving the cosmological moduli stabilization problem .",
    "such an initial state seems quite natural in the context of string theory and , in particular , may be relevant to the brane gas picture of string cosmology  @xcite . while some progress has been made in formulating the scenario in the context of compactification manifolds compatible with realistic particle physics  @xcite , the brane gas picture may greatly benefit from the mechanism suggested here  .",
    "in addition to the stabilization of moduli , we have presented a cosmological scenario that has an attractive way of generating an inflationary epoch in the early universe , with a natural graceful exit mechanism .",
    "this phase of accelerated expansion is generated by a gas of wrapped membranes .",
    "however , as mentioned in the previous section , this cosmological scenario suffers from three remaining problems .",
    "the first is the domain wall problem .",
    "the simplest possible solution is to simply not include walls in the picture in the first place",
    ". such an initial condition is compatible with the original brandenberger - vafa picture presented in  @xcite , in which the initial state of the universe contains only strings .",
    "this also seems to be a natural starting point within the context of the type iib corner of the string moduli space , since the iib theory does not admit stable two - branes .",
    "using only a gas of string winding modes will suffice to stabilize the modulus field by our mechanism .",
    "the only downside of this picture is that a separate mechanism for inflating the universe is needed  .",
    "a second possibility is to have the walls decay at some point after inflation .",
    "if the walls decay into radiation , this would also provide our scenario with a reheating mechanism ( avoiding another obstacle ) .",
    "several ways in which this can happen are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize them here .",
    "one possibility is that the branes are stabilized embedded branes , which decay once the temperature of the plasma drops sufficiently  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the branes collide with anti - branes and annihilate , or if holes nucleate in the branes and expand at the speed of light , disolving them  @xcite .",
    "since this would occur after inflation , there would be no causal obstruction to the local decay of sub - hubble - volume brane networks . a final possibility was recently proposed by stojkovic , freese and starkman  @xcite .",
    "a sufficient abundance of primordial black holes can perforate domain walls and then the holes in the walls can grow and destroy the walls altogether .    another problem with our cosmological scenario is how to generate a scale invariant spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "this seems impossible to do within the context of wall inflation without introducing some sort of new physics .",
    "finally , we note that it is possible to obtain slow - roll inflation once the potential begins to dominate ( after the walls are gone ) .",
    "one can tune the potential so that the barrier is very flat at the top .",
    "an example of this is provided using the imaginary component ( the axion ) of the volume modulus @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "a second condition required to build a successful model , is that the initial conditions would have to be tuned so that the wall and string winding gases place the modulus gently at the top of the barrier .",
    "in such a model , the modulus itself could act as the inflaton and generate a scale invariant spectrum .",
    "we leave more detailed explorations of the above speculations to future research projects .",
