    "the dynamics of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) jets and the spectral and temporal evolution of their afterglows remain an important problem ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "much of what we know about grb progenitors and the central engines that power them comes from multi - wavelength observations of their afterglows . from the analytic models which predict the evolution of these light curves it is possible to extract estimates of jet opening angles , the energetics of the outflows , and the properties of the circumburst medium @xcite",
    "however , more recent numerical modeling has claimed that there are strong discrepancies between the analytic and numerical models of grb jets .",
    "a conical jet - like outflow expanding at a lorentz factor @xmath5 evolves as if it were a conical section of a spherical outflow as long as @xmath6 , since for @xmath6 the ( rest frame ) transverse light crossing time of the jet is larger than the expansion / deceleration time . at this stage ,",
    "the flow is described by the spherical blandford - mckee ( bm ) blast wave solutions @xcite , with @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the blast wave radius , @xmath9 is the ambient medium number density , and @xmath10 is the isotropic equivalent energy , related to the ( two - sided ) jet energy by @xmath11 ( note that @xmath12 is the angular radius ) . for @xmath6",
    "a distant on axis observer can not distinguish a jet from a sphere since the emitted radiation is beamed into a @xmath13 cone .",
    "the flow decelerates to @xmath14 at source frame time @xmath15 corresponding to an observer s frame time @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18  erg and @xmath19 .",
    "( for a burst located at redshift @xmath20 , all observed times should be increased by a factor @xmath21 ; we do not explicitly show this correction in our eqs . )",
    "the sideways expansion is expected to be relativistic as long as the blast wave is relativistic and the post - shock energy density is relativistic @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , at @xmath22 the lateral expansion rapidly increases the jet opening angle and accelerates its deceleration @xcite , reducing @xmath5 to @xmath23 with only a logarithmic increase of @xmath8 ( to @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , the observed time scale for the flow to become transrelativistic is @xcite @xmath25 on a similar time scale , the flow is expected to become quasi - spherical , i.e. the jet is expected to expand to @xmath26,and the outflow is subsequently expected to evolve into the spherical non - relativistic sedov - von neumann - taylor ( st ) flow .",
    "this simple analytic description of jet expansion was challenged by a series of numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "it was argued , based on the numerical results , that the sideways expansion of the jet is not relativistic , and that the jet retains its narrow original opening angle , @xmath12 , as long as it is relativistic @xcite .",
    "this implies that the jet continues to evolve like a conical section of a spherical outflow with energy @xmath10 , with lorentz factor following the bm solution , up to the radius @xmath27 at which it becomes sub - relativistic , @xmath28    the different descriptions of jet evolution inferred from analytic and numeric modeling lead to different predictions for the observed properties of grb afterglows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the suppression of the observed flux produced by the jet blast wave at @xmath29 , compared to that produced by a spherical blast wave with the same @xmath10 , is smaller ( i.e. the `` jet break '' is less pronounced ) if the jet does not expand significantly while it is relativistic .",
    "furthermore , if the jet does not expand significantly and remains highly collimated and relativistic at @xmath4 , then the accuracy of the late - time calorimetric estimates of the jet energy , which assume quasi - spherical emission at @xmath30 @xcite , is questionable .",
    "the main goal of this letter is to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the analytic and numeric description of jet expansion .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the properties of the flow and of the emitted radiation will be given in a subsequent more comprehensive publication @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculations are described in   [ sec : model ] , and their results regarding jet expansion are described in   [ sec : dynamics ] . in   [ sec : radiation ] we briefly discuss the implications for jet breaks and grb calorimetry .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in   [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we use the reldafna code @xcite to numerically solve the 2d special relativistic hydrodynamics equations describing the flow of an ideal fluid with a constant polytropic index , @xmath31 .",
    "reldafna is a godunov type eulerian code , with second order accuracy time and space integration .",
    "it uses adaptive mesh refinement and is massively parallelized , allowing the use of effectively high resolution even in multiscale problems such as the current jet simulations .",
    "reldafna was tested ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also   [ sec : dynamics ] ) by comparing its solutions for standard test problems to those of similar codes @xcite , and was shown to perform similarly .",
    "the initial conditions chosen for our numerical calculations were a conical section of opening angle @xmath12 within which the flow fields are given by the bm solution for @xmath32  erg and initial density @xmath33 , surrounded by a static uniform cold gas of density @xmath33 and pressure @xmath34 .",
    "the radius of the conical section was chosen so that the lorentz factor of the fluid behind the shock is @xmath35 .",
    "we present solutions for @xmath360.2 , 0.1 and 0.05 ( corresponding to @xmath37 , and @xmath38 erg ) .",
    "the @xmath39 simulation is similar to the simulation presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter zm09 ) .",
    "the only difference is that we use @xmath31 , instead of an equation of state for which @xmath40 varies smoothly between @xmath31 for relativistic material and @xmath41 for non - relativistic material .",
    "our choice is inaccurate for late times , when the flow becomes non - relativistic , but this inaccuracy is not expected to affect our results qualitatively . moreover , if a significant fraction of the post - shock energy density is carried by magnetic fields and relativistic electrons , as required in order to account for afterglow observations , @xmath40 remains close to its relativistic value further into the non - relativistic flow stage .",
    "the size of the finest numerical cells in the simulation was initially taken as @xmath42  cm , similar to zm09 .",
    "the results of our simulations were checked for convergence by increasing the grid resolution by a factor of 4 in each dimension .",
    "increased resolution calculations were carried out both for initial conditions identical to those of the nominal calculations , and for initial conditions with a reduced radius of the conical section corresponding to a post - shock bm lorentz factor of @xmath43 .",
    "these convergence tests indicated that while the lorentz factor behind the shock , as well as the lightcurves of the high frequencies that depend strongly on the high @xmath5 region , are not yet fully converged , the spreading of the jet is converged to a level of 10% . for example , the time it takes the jet angle to double its initial value decreased in the convergence test by @xmath44 for @xmath39 and by @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the results presented in the next sections are the ones obtained with the higher numerical resolution .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the numerics will be given in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:2djet_theta02_rshock ] presents the evolution of the jet opening angle , @xmath47 , as a function of time .",
    "@xmath48 is defined as the cone opening angle within which 95% of the energy , excluding rest mass energy , is included .",
    "we find that significant sideways expansion begins at @xmath49 , in accordance with the analytic estimates described in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "narrower jets begin expanding earlier , @xmath50 , in accordance with the analytic estimates , and are therefore expected to also decelerate earlier .",
    "the latter point is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : large_vs_small_jet ] , which shows the density distribution of the @xmath36  0.2 and 0.05 jet flows at identical time @xmath51 ( note that @xmath52 is independent of @xmath12 ) .",
    "the @xmath39 jet has tripled its opening angle and its tip is still close to its `` isotropic equivalent location '' , i.e. the location of a spherical blast wave with the same @xmath10 .",
    "the opening angle of the @xmath46 jet has increased by more than an order of magnitude , and its spreading has significantly slowed down its expansion .",
    "the influence of jet expansion at @xmath52 is much stronger for the narrower jet , in accordance with the analytic analysis described in   [ sec : intro ] : the ratio of @xmath52 to @xmath53 is close to unity for the @xmath54 jet , and significantly larger for the @xmath55 jet : at the source frame @xmath56 so that @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "we thus find that the jet sideways expansion is relativistic and becomes significant at @xmath59 , and that this expansion leads to deceleration to sub - relativistic velocity on a time scale @xmath60 , which for @xmath61 is much smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the analytic analysis , and inconsistent with the claims based on earlier numerical modeling , that jet expansion is not significant up to @xmath63 .    in order to identify the origin of this apparent discrepancy",
    ", we compare our numerical results to those of zm09 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2djet_theta02 ] .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the jet expansion obtained in our calculation is similar to that obtained in zm09 .",
    "the conclusion that sideways expansion is not relativistic , and unimportant until @xmath63 , was reached in zm09 based on noting that the growth of @xmath47 is much slower than the exponential growth expected for relativistic sideways expansion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2djet_theta02 ] ) . this conclusion is , however , not valid , since exponential growth is expected only for @xmath64 , and is not applicable for the evolution of the @xmath39 jet under consideration , for which expansion becomes significant only for @xmath65 .    for this regime of @xmath5 , one can not use the exponential approximation , but should rather solve the differential equation @xmath66 describing relativistic sideways expansion at the post shock speed of sound @xmath67 in the jet frame ( @xmath68 for @xmath69 ) , along with mass and momentum conservation , that determine @xmath70 ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "note that we replace eq .",
    "( 3 ) of @xcite with the more accurate eq .  ( [ eq : rhoads ] ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this modification leads to a significant modification of @xmath71 only for @xmath72 . for @xmath64 , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoads ] ) is indeed exponential , @xmath73 .",
    "however , such a regime does not exist for @xmath39 . as demonstrated in the figure ,",
    "the numerical results are in good agreement with the solution of the simple model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoads ] ) , and therefore confirm the validity of the analytic estimates described in   [ sec : intro ] .",
    "we have calculated the synchrotron emission expected to be produced by shock accelerated electrons assuming that the magnetic field and the electrons hold a constant fraction @xmath74 of the internal energy , and that the electron energy distribution is a power law with index @xmath75 .",
    "electron cooling and synchrotron self absorption are neglected .",
    "figure  [ fig:2d_lightcurves ] shows radio light - curves ( @xmath76  3ghz , for which self - absorption is not important ) predicted by the numerical model for the @xmath39 jet , for observers lying on the jet axis and at an angle @xmath77 .",
    "the numerical lightcurves of the jet are compared with those predicted for spherical ( 1d ) fireballs with total energy @xmath10 and @xmath78 , as well as with that predicted for a conical section with opening angle @xmath12 of a spherical @xmath10 fireball , representing the lightcurve predicted for a non - expanding jet .",
    "also shown is the radio flux of a spherical fireball with energy @xmath78 , assuming its evolution is described by the non - relativistic sedov - von neumann - taylor solution .",
    "the jet emission is suppressed , compared to that of a spherical blast wave with energy @xmath10 , at @xmath79 .",
    "the suppression is larger than would be predicted for a non - expanding jet ( i.e. not due to the  missing flux  from the absent @xmath80 parts of the shell , but rather to the jet spreading , in accordance with * ? ? ?",
    "the figure also demonstrates that at @xmath4 , the observed flux is similar to that of a spherical fireball with energy @xmath78 , for observers lying both on - axis and at an angle @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , although at @xmath30 the jet has not yet reached full spherical symmetry and is still mildly collimated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2djet_theta02_rshock ] ) , at @xmath4 the flux is well approximated by that of a blastwave following the non - relativistic st evolution .    in figure [ fig:2d_lightcurves_frel ]",
    "we compare the @xmath82 jet lightcurves to those of spherical ( 1d ) fireballs with the corresponding @xmath83 .",
    "scaling @xmath84 with @xmath85 brings the lightcurves to a similar ( universal ) form , implying that significant jet spreading occurs at @xmath86 .",
    "although , as noted above , at @xmath30 the jet does not yet reach full spherical symmetry , from @xmath87 onward the lightcurves do not depart from those of the 1d @xmath83 fireballs by more than @xmath88 . a more detailed analysis of the jet lightcurves will be presented in @xcite .",
    "while there still remain many unsolved problems regarding the structure and dynamics of grb jets that can only be addressed by detailed hydrodynamic modeling , our work has demonstrated that analytic estimates provide a reasonable description of the behavior of the jet and the evolution of its afterglow .",
    "we have shown that relativistic sideways expansion becomes significant at @xmath89 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2djet_theta02_rshock ] ) , in accordance with analytic estimates , and that the expansion is well described by the modified rhoads model ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2djet_theta02 ] , eq .",
    "[ eq : rhoads ] ) ) .",
    "our numerical results are consistent with those of zm09 , who calculated @xmath39 jet evolution .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between earlier numerical and analytic results arose because the simulations were nt compared to the full solution of rhoads model ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2djet_theta02 ] ,   [ sec : dynamics ] ) , and because for the large @xmath12 chosen it is difficult to test the relativistic expansion assumption since @xmath52 and @xmath53 are similar , @xmath90 ( see   [ sec : dynamics ] ) .",
    "jet expansion has a significant effect on its observed properties .",
    "the suppression of the flux at @xmath22 is stronger than in the absence of spreading ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_lightcurves ] ) , and at @xmath4 the emission of radiation from the jet blast wave is similar to that of a spherical blast wave carrying the same energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_lightcurves],[fig:2d_lightcurves_frel ] ) .",
    "moreover , although at @xmath30 the jet has not yet reached full spherical symmetry and is still mildly collimated ( see fig",

    "[ fig:2d_lightcurves ] ) .",
    "thus , the total ( calorimetric ) energy of grb blast waves may be estimated with only a small fractional error based on @xmath4 observations . we expect to see this technique and its variants @xcite applied to increasing numbers of grb afterglows when the new generation of facilities ( evla , lofar ) starts full operation .",
