    "* ) without sophisticated background subtraction , then we excised the areas of the detector where a significant signal due to sources was detected .",

    "however , in the overlapping flux range the latter is characterized by large errors due to the small number of relatively bright sources in the _ chandra _ deep fields .",
    "interestingly enough , the xmm ",
    "cosmos counts match nicely , with smaller errors , those of the wide area hellas2xmm survey ( baldi et al .",
    "2002 ) , while the pioneering measurements of bepposax @xcite are systematically higher than the counts from xmm - cosmos .",
    "one of the main aims of xmm - cosmos with its large and medium  deep coverage , is to provide a solid census of the x - ray source population to be compared with observations and models of agn evolution .",
    "according to recent synthesis models ( see e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) a high fraction of heavily obscured agn is necessary to explain the spectral shape and the intensity of the x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "we examine therefore which fraction of xrb is resolved into discrete sources in our survey .    as a first test , we computed the flux which xmm - cosmos itself resolves into discrete sources by summing their fluxes weighted on the sky coverage in the 0.52 kev , 210 kev and 5 - 10 kev energy bands .",
    "as in @xcite we used as reference value of the normalization at 1 kev of the xrb spectrum that of @xcite which assumes that the spectral shape in the 1 - 10 kev band is a power - law with spectral index @xmath19=1.4 and a normalization at 1kev of 11.6 kev @xmath6 s@xmath7 kev@xmath7 . the latter value corresponds to a flux of 0.80 , 2.31 and 1.27@xmath106 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7  deg@xmath107   in the 0.52 kev , 210 kev and 5 - 10 kev energy bands , respectively . in the 0.52 kev band",
    "we measure a contribution of the sources to the xrb which corresponds to a normalization at 1 kev of 0.49@xmath108 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7  deg@xmath107 .",
    "the corresponding values in the 210 kev and 510 kev bands are 0.92@xmath109 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7  deg@xmath107   and 0.28@xmath110 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7  deg@xmath107 .",
    "therefore xmm - cosmos resolves by itself @xmath065@xmath17 , @xmath040@xmath17 and @xmath022@xmath17 of the xrb into discrete sources in the 0.52 kev , 210 kev and 510 kev energy bands , respectively .",
    "it is worth noticing that the flux measured by @xcite is the highest measured in literature in the 110 kev energy range ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a complete collection ) .",
    "it is also worth noticing that we computed the fraction of resolved xrb by assuming that all the sources have the same spectrum .",
    "therefore , in our estimate , effects due to the broad absorption and spectral index distributions of agns are not included .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : logn1 ] , [ fig : logn2 ] and [ fig : pippo ] we compared our logn - logs to those predicted by the recent xrb model of @xcite .",
    "this model makes use of the most recent observational constraints on the agn populations and includes a conspicuous fraction of compton thick agn which , however , are not expected to significantly contribute to the xmm - cosmos counts . in the 0.52 kev band",
    "a direct comparison of our data with the model shows a 1@xmath15 agreement at the bright end . at the faint",
    "end the model predicts a slightly higher normalization when compared to most of the plotted data , including ours .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in the 210 kev band .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the model the average unabsorbed power - law spectral index of the sources is @xmath341.8 in the flux interval sampled by xmm - cosmos ( see fig .",
    "19 in @xcite ) .",
    "since in our data analysis we assumed @xmath111=1.7 we expect in this band a slight ( @xmath010% ) underestimation of the fluxes when compared to those of the model .",
    "this effect is almost negligible ( i.e. @xmath165% ) in the other bands investigated here .    by integrating our best fit 210 kev logn - logs between infinite and zero , and assuming that the slope of the `` real '' logn - logs remains constant down to low fluxes",
    ", we estimated the total contribution of agns to the xrb .",
    "we predict a total flux of agns in the xrb of 1.25@xmath106 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7  deg@xmath107 .",
    "this value is @xmath040% lower than that measured by @xcite , and @xmath0 25% smaller than those obtained by integration the model logn - logs of @xcite which predicts a flux of @xmath01.66@xmath106 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7  deg@xmath107 .",
    "this discrepancy between our predicted flux and that of @xcite , could arise by the fact that , in our measurement , we consider that all the sources have the same spectrum and from statistical uncertainty of the logn - logs parameters . by assuming an average spectral index @xmath111=1.4 for all our sources , we obtain a value for the total flux of the agns of @xmath01.48@xmath106 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7  deg@xmath107   which is consistent , within the statistical uncertanties , with the prediction of the model . considering the total flux of the xrb predicted by the model and our estimate from the logn - logs distributions , in the 210 kev band ,",
    "xmm - cosmos resolves the @xmath05565% of the total flux of the xrb into discrete sources .",
    "it is interesting to observe how in the 510 kev band our data are in good agreement with the prediction of the model .",
    "this result is particularly important since in this band it is expected the major contribution of highly absorbed agn , which are an important ingredient of the xrb models .",
    "a detailed analysis of the spectral properties of the brightest x - ray sources in xmm - cosmos is presented by @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of source counts distributions varies significantly among different surveys ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this `` sample variance '' , can be explained as a combination of poissonian variations and effects due to the clustering of sources @xcite .",
    "the variance of counts in cells for sources which are angularly correlated can be obtained with : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the mean density of objects in the sky , @xmath56 is the cell size , and @xmath114 is the angular two  point correlation function .",
    "the first term of eq . [ cvar ] is the poissonian variance and the second term is introduced by the large scale structure . in order to determine whether the differences observed in the source counts of different surveys",
    "could arise from the clustering of x - ray sources , we estimated the amplitude of the fluctuations from our data , by producing subsamples of our survey with areas comparable to those of . e.g. , _ chandra _ surveys .",
    "+ the xmm - cosmos field and the monte carlo sample fields of section 4 were divided in 4,9,16 and 25 square boxes . making use of the 0.52 kev energy band data , we computed for each subfield , the ratio of the number of real sources to the number of random sources . in order to prevent incompleteness artifacts , we conservatively cut the limiting flux of the random and data sample to 5@xmath410@xmath8 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 . at this flux",
    "our survey is complete over the entire area . in order to avoid artifacts introduced by the missing pointings in the external part of the field of view",

    "using eq .",
    "[ cvar ] we computed the expected amplitude of source counts fluctuations with @xmath114 taken from @xcite .",
    "they computed the x - ray two  point correlation function in the xmm - cosmos field and detected clustering signal with angular correlation length @xmath117 @xmath01.9@xmath20 @xmath00.8@xmath20 and @xmath06@xmath20 in the 0.52 kev , 24.5 kev and 4.510 kev band , respectively .",
    "the observed slope is @xmath118=1.8 in all the energy bands .",
    "the predicted fractional standard deviations are therefore 0.13 , 0.19 , 0.23 and 0.28 on scales of 0.44 deg@xmath1 , 0.19 deg@xmath1 , 0.11 deg@xmath1 and 0.07 deg@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "these values are in good agreement with those observed in the sub - samples of our dataset as shown by the value of the fitted @xmath119 to the counts in cell fluctuations ( see table [ tab : fit ] ) . as shown in table [",
    "tab : fit ] , at this limiting flux and on the areas considered here the main contribution to the source counts fluctuations is from the poissonian noise . at the flux limit assumed here ,",
    "the ratio @xmath120/@xmath121 increases from @xmath00.5 on the smallest scale ( 16 x 16 arcmin ) to @xmath00.85 on the largest scale ( 40 x 40 arcmin ) .",
    "this ratio scales as : @xmath122 where @xmath113 deg@xmath107 is the surface density of the sources , @xmath117 ( deg ) is the angular correlation length and @xmath123 ( deg ) is the size of the cell . in order to estimate at which flux limit fluctuations introduced by the large scale structure are predominant , we estimate that @xmath120/@xmath121 would be @xmath01 on the smallest scale , corresponding to a chandra acis field of view ( 16 x 16 arcmin ) at a surface density of the order of @xmath0900 deg@xmath107 , corresponding to a 0.5 - 2 kev flux s@xmath0 8@xmath410@xmath5 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 . at even fainter fluxes the dominant contribution to the total expected source counts fluctuations on this area ( @xmath124 ) comes from the large scale structure ,",
    "therefore the contribution of statistical fluctuations becomes less important . with the same procedure , we can estimate the total expected fluctuations ( @xmath124 ) and the relative importance of @xmath121 and @xmath120 also for the hard band ( 5 - 10 kev ) , even if in this band we do not have enough statistics to divide our field in sub - samples . using the formal best fit for @xmath117 in this band found by miyaji et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( @xmath117=6@xmath20 ) , we find that at the faintest 5 - 10 kev flux ( s@xmath010@xmath57 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 ) sampled by the xmm - cosmos survey ( @xmath125 110 deg@xmath107 ) the ratio @xmath120/@xmath121 is smaller than one on all the four scales here analyzed , with a total expected standard deviation of the fluctuations ranging from @xmath00.20 on the largest scale to @xmath00.40 on the smallest scale .",
    "these values for @xmath124 are significantly larger than those shown in table 3 for the soft band , because in the hard band the surface density of sources is lower and the angular correlation length is higher than in the soft band .",
    "this analysis is at least qualitatively consistent with figures 8 and 10 , which show a significantly larger dispersion in the data from different surveys in the hard band than in the soft band .",
    "moreover , the results here discussed are also consistent with the observed fluctuations in the deep chandra fields ( see , for example , bauer et al .",

    "this estimate must be made with care since we have only one sample on this scale .",
    "assuming that the angular correlation function of @xcite was universal , the residual uncertainties on the source counts are estimated to be @xmath165 - 6% in the 0.52 kev and 210 kev bands , and of the order of the 10% in the 510 kev band .",

    "<S> we present the data analysis and the x  ray source counts for the first season of xmm_newton _   observations in the cosmos field . </S>",
    "<S> the survey covers @xmath02 deg@xmath1 within the region of sky bounded by @xmath2 ; @xmath3 with a total net integration time of 504 ks . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum likelihood source detection was performed in the 0.52 kev , 24.5 kev and 4.510 kev energy bands and 1390 point - like sources were detected in at least one band . </S>",
    "<S> detailed monte carlo simulations were performed to fully test the source detection method and to derive the sky coverage to be used in the computation of the logn - logs relations . </S>",
    "<S> these relations have been then derived in the 0.52 kev , 210 kev and 510 kev energy bands , down to flux limits of 7.2@xmath410@xmath5 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 , 4.0@xmath410@xmath8 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 and 9.7@xmath410@xmath8 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the large number of sources detected in the cosmos survey , the logn - logs curves are tightly constrained over a range of fluxes which were poorly covered by previous surveys , especially in the 210 and 510 kev bands . the 0.52 kev and 210 kev differential logn - logs were fitted with a broken power - law model which revealed a euclidean slope ( @xmath92.5 ) at the bright end and a flatter slope ( @xmath91.5 ) at faint fluxes . in the 510 kev energy band </S>",
    "<S> a single power - law provides an acceptable fit to the observed source counts with a slope @xmath92.4 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with the results of previous surveys shows good agreement in all the energy bands under investigation in the overlapping flux range </S>",
    "<S> . we also notice a remarkable agreement between our logn - logs relations and the most recent model of the xrb . </S>",
    "<S> the slightly different normalizations observed in the source counts of cosmos and previous surveys can be largely explained as a combination of low counting statistics and cosmic variance introduced by the large scale structure . </S>"
