    "in classical chemical kinetics , the evolution of concentrations of various components in a reaction is described by ordinary differential equations .",
    "such a description turns out to be unsatisfactory in a number of applications , especially in biology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are several ways to construct a more adequate mathematical model .",
    "if the reaction is fast enough , one should take into account that the concentration is not constant in space in the volume where the reaction takes place .",
    "then , the change of concentration due to spatial transport should be taken into account and the system of odes should be replaced by a system of pdes of reaction - diffusion type . in some cases , one should also take into account random changes in time of the rates of reaction .",
    "then , the ode is replaced by a stochastic differential equation .",
    "if the rates change randomly not just in time but also in space , then evolution of concentrations can be described by a system of spdes .    on the other hand ,",
    "the rates of chemical reactions in the system and the diffusion coefficients may , and as a rule do , have different orders .",
    "some of them are much smaller than others and this allows one to apply various versions of the averaging principle and other asymptotic methods , thereby eventually obtaining a relatively simple description of the system .    in this paper , we study the case where the diffusion rate is much larger than the rate of reaction and we show that in this case , it is possible to replace spdes of reaction - diffusion type by suitable sdes .",
    "such an approximation is valid , in particular , if the reaction occurs only on the boundary of the domain ( this means that the nonlinearity is included in the boundary conditions ) .",
    "this replacement is a result of _ averaging _ in the fast spatial transport .",
    "we would like to stress that our approach allows us also to calculate the main terms of deviations of the solution of the original problem from the simplified model .",
    "notice , moreover , that the case where the diffusion coefficients and some of the reaction rates are large compared with other rates can be considered in a similar way .",
    "more precisely , we are dealing with the following class of equations : @xmath0 for some @xmath1 .",
    "these are reaction - diffusion equations perturbed by a noise of multiplicative type , where the diffusion term @xmath2 is multiplied by a large parameter @xmath3 and a noisy perturbation is also acting on the boundary of the domain  @xmath4 .    here , @xmath4 is a bounded open subset of @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , having a regular boundary ( for more details , see section [ sec2 ] ) and , in the case @xmath7 , we take @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "@xmath2 is a uniformly elliptic second order operator and @xmath9 is the corresponding conormal derivative .",
    "this is why the same constant @xmath3 , which is in front of the operator @xmath2 , is also present in front of the conormal derivative @xmath10 . in what follows",
    ", we shall denote by @xmath11 the realization in @xmath12 of the differential operator @xmath2 , endowed with the conormal boundary condition .",
    "the coefficients @xmath13 are assumed to be measurable and satisfy a lipschitz condition with respect to the third variable , uniformly with respect to the first two variables , and the mapping @xmath14 is bounded with respect to the space variable .",
    "the noisy perturbations are given by two independent cylindrical wiener processes , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , defined on the same stochastic basis @xmath17 , which take values on @xmath12 and @xmath18 , respectively , and have covariance operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . , we denote by @xmath21 the banach space of bounded linear operators on @xmath22 and by @xmath23 the subspace of nonnegative and symmetric operators . ] in space dimension @xmath7 , we can take @xmath24 equal to the identity operator so that we can deal with space  time white noise .",
    "moreover , as @xmath25 , in space dimension @xmath7 , we do not assume any condition on @xmath26 .",
    "stochastic partial differential equations with a noisy term also acting on the boundary have been studied by several authors ; see , for example , da prato and zabczyk @xcite , freidlin and wentzell @xcite and sowers @xcite",
    ". the last two mentioned papers also deal with some limiting results with respect to small parameters appearing in front of the noise .",
    "however , the limiting results which we are studying in the present paper seem to be completely new and we are not aware of any previous results dealing with the same sort of multiscaling problem , even in the simpler case of homogeneous boundary conditions ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , our interest is in studying the limiting behavior of the solution @xmath28 of problem ( [ eq1 ] ) as the parameter @xmath29 goes to zero , under the assumption that the diffusion @xmath30 associated with the operator @xmath2 , endowed with the conormal boundary condition [ this corresponds to a diffusion @xmath30 on some probability space @xmath31 which reflect on the boundary of @xmath4 ] , admits a unique invariant measure @xmath33 and a spectral gap occurs .",
    "that is , for any @xmath34 , @xmath35 for some constant @xmath36 . this can be expressed in terms of the semigroup @xmath37 associated with the diffusion @xmath30 , by saying that @xmath38 moreover , as shown in remark [ rem21 ] , the space @xmath12 is continuously embedded into @xmath39 .",
    "our aim is to prove that equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be replaced by a suitable one - dimensional stochastic differential equation , whose coefficients are obtained by averaging the coefficients and the noises in ( [ eq1 ] ) with respect to the invariant measure @xmath33 .",

    ", we show that it can be rewritten as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a standard brownian motion and the diffusion coefficient @xmath57 is explicitly given in terms of @xmath24 , @xmath58 , @xmath26 and @xmath59 .",
    "when we say that equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be replaced by ( [ eq1bis ] ) , we mean that the solution @xmath28 of ( [ eq1 ] ) can be approximated by the solution @xmath60 of ( [ eq1bis ] ) in the following sense : @xmath61}\\biggl|\\int_d    @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    in order to prove ( [ finale ] )",
