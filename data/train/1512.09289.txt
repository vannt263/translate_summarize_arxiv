    "in the last few decades , numerical simulation has become an indispensable tool for plasma physics in a wide range of problems from astro- and atmosphere physics , to laser plasma interactions . often for such studies one needs to model plasma kinetics in presence of the strong electromagnetic fields , which produce relativistic motion of the charges in plasma .",
    "such systems can be described by using the particle methods @xcite , where plasma is presented by the _ macro - particles _ , which have the same charge - to - mass ratios as plasma particle species , but represent large quantities of the real ones .",
    "one example here is the particle - in - cell ( pic ) method , which is widely used for the plasma modeling @xcite . in pic",
    ", the electromagnetic fields are calculated at the nodes of a spatial grid , and each macro - particle interacts with only a few such nodes in its vicinity .",
    "the majority of the pic codes advance the electromagnetic fields via the finite - difference time domain ( fdtd ) methods @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the finite differences approximate all derivatives in the maxwell equations , and the discrete steps are used to advance the fields - particles system in time .",
    "the fdtd scheme stability is defined by the resolutions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which define the precisions of the temporal and spatial derivatives of the electric and magnetic fields . in practice , the velocities of the traveling waves in fdtd happen to depend on how well their propagation is resolved in space and time , and this phenomenon is known as the _",
    "numerical dispersion_. in the cases , where electromagnetic waves co - propagate with the relativistic particles , such dispersion may result to the unphysical wave - particle interactions , which should be treated explicitly @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the derivatives in the maxwell equations are coupled , and for the better accuracy , the fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 in fdtd are usually staggered in space and in time . in this case , the terms @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the lorentz force , with which wave acts on the particle , may compensate each other with a reminder @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the particle s lorentz factor . for a relativistic particle",
    ", the force @xmath8 can be very small , and for the correct projection of the staggered fields a very fine temporal and spatial resolutions may be required @xcite .",
    "the mentioned issues become especially important in modeling the wakefield acceleration of particles ( wfa ) . in wfa ,",
    "the strong plasma waves transfer the energy from a high - power laser or particle _ driver _ beam , to the trailing particles , eventually injected into these waves @xcite .",
    "these accelerators are being actively explored for the last two decades in pursuit for the compact sources of high intensity beams of energetic particles .",
    "the three - dimensional fdtd pic modeling is commonly used for the detailed theoretical studies of wfa physics , and to interpret the experiments .",
    "besides the wfa modeling , such simulations are used to study the accompanying phenomena , e.g. generation of x - rays by the accelerated charges @xcite , collimation of the particle beams @xcite etc .",
    "one alternative to the fdtd approach is the pseudo - spectral time domain ( pstd ) method @xcite . in pstd , at each time step the equations are translated from the real space to a spectral ( e.g. fourier ) domain , where the derivatives are presented by the linear coefficients .",
    "this approach provides high precision in calculation of the spatial derivatives , and , in some cases , allows to run simulations with the much lower spatial resolutions , than the finite differences methods @xcite .",
    "moreover , for a wide class of equations , their spectral counterparts can be integrated in time analytically , so that the accuracy of the fields dynamics modeling does not directly depend on the simulations temporal resolution @xcite .",
    "this is known as the pseudo - spectral analytical time domain ( psatd ) method , and it was shown to produce no numerical dispersion of electromagnetic fields associated with the temporal and spatial resolutions in pic @xcite .",
    "here we develop the psatd pic considering that the model geometry has a certain level of cylindrical symmetry , which allows to replace the three - dimensional cartesian geometry with a series of cylindrical models with different symmetries , e.g. fourier series over the azimuthal angle .",
    "this is known as the _ quasi - cylindrical _ geometry , and previously it was proposed for the fdtd pic simulations in @xcite . allowing to model the laser - plasma interactions with only few angular modes ,",
    "the quasi - cylindrical fdtd approach has become popular for modeling wfa - type problems @xcite , and the combinations of such method with the fourier methods were considered @xcite . for the fully spectral quasi - cylindrical psatd , we consider the decomposition into the _ cylindrical harmonics _",
    ", where the angular fourier decomposition is naturally extended by the fourier - bessel transform of the azimuthal modes .",
    "previously , the quasi - cylindrical spectral modeling was considered for a variety of problems @xcite , and in this work we apply it for pic simulations .",
    "one similar method was recently developed in @xcite , in parallel with the present one .",
    "in @xcite the different mathematical formulation is used , which has led to a different numerical scheme .",
    "the physical and mathematical models are presented and discussed in [ sec1 ] . in [ sec2 ] , we briefly discuss the implementation of the scheme , and demonstrate a few examples of laser plasma simulations , which are compared to the ones provided by the quasi - cylindrical fdtd pic .",
    "the conclusions are given in [ sec3 ] , and are followed by a brief review of the spectral transforms ( [ appendix1 ] ) , and their properties ( [ appendix2 ] ) .",
    "two main ingredients of a numerical model of plasma electrodynamics are the integrator of the electromagnetic equations called _ maxwell solver _ , and the _ particle pusher _ , which integrates the motion equations for the charged plasma particles . in our maxwell solver",
    ", we employ the fourier - bessel transform for the spatial distributions of electromagnetic fields , and the charge densities and currents .",
    "the description of the transform is provided in [ appendix1 ] , and in the following text we denote the spectral images with the hat - like accent , @xmath9 .",
    "the spatial dependencies are considered in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath10 , while the vectorial components are chosen to be cartesian , @xmath11 , so they are naturally well - defined on the axis , @xmath12 ( in contrast to the cylindrical components ) .",
    "the components of the fourier - bessel series are the cylindrical harmonics , which are the eigenfunctions of the laplace operator , @xmath13 . on the other hand , the first - order operators involve coupling of the azimuthal modes , and do not transform directly into the linear coefficients ( see [ appendix2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , to take advantage of these properties , we derive the mathematical model , where the laplace operator acts on the functions updated in time ( i.e. are acted on by @xmath14 ) , and the operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 act only on the terms , which are re - calculated at each iteration .",
    "for convenience , in the following discussion we use the dimensionless units  the field components are normalized as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mass of the electron and the elementary charge , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the wavenumber and the frequency , which correspond to a scale unity @xmath24 ( e.g. laser or plasma wavelength ) .",
    "the mass , charge , velocity , coordinates of the particles are in the units of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 respectively , and time is normalized to @xmath27 .",
    "the particles density @xmath28 in this notations is normalized to the critical plasma density for the unity wavelength , @xmath29 .      to construct the spectral maxwell solver , we start from the standard equations for the electric and magnetic fields ( cf @xcite ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the normalized charge density and current .    as mentioned before , in the fourier - bessel space the first - order operators couple the angular fourier modes , and are to be excluded from the integration . for this",
    ", we replace the magnetic field with its rotation vector , @xmath33 , which in contrast to the pseudo - vector @xmath34 is a polar vector , and it behaves similarly to the currents ( in magnetostatic problems @xmath35 ) .",
    "next , we take the curl of the faraday s law and combine it with the poisson equation , which leads to :    [ maxwell1 ] @xmath36 and the equation for the magnetic field is : @xmath37    equations ( [ maxwell1 ] ) are now well adapted for the integration in the spectral space , and after the fourier - bessel transform the first pair reads :    [ maxwell2 ] @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the longitudinal and transverse wavenumbers ( for details see [ appendix1,appendix2 ] ) . equations ( [ maxwell2:1 ] ) can be used to advance @xmath42 and @xmath43 in time , and the magnetic field , needed for the lorentz force calculation , follows from the static equation , @xmath44    it is easy to see , that , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be advanced in time with [ maxwell2:1 ] , the first - order derivatives appear only to communicate fields with particles , so they are recalculated at each integration step .      in the time - domain",
    "particle - in - cell methods , the system of fields and particles advances in time by the discrete steps .",
    "let us consider one integration cycle on the time interval @xmath45 , and denote the variables at @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 with the indices `` 0'',``1/2 '' and `` 1 '' respectively . during one cycle",

    "lorentz force is calculated at the particles positions , and their velocities are advanced to @xmath61 .",
    "the steps ( * i , ii , vi * ) are common for the pic methods , and their various implementations are widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the steps ( * iii * ) and ( * v * ) , are simply the translations between spectral and real domains , and these operations are discussed in [ appendix2 ] .    the step ( * iv * ) corresponds to the spectral maxwell solver , where eqs .",
    "( [ maxwell2:1 ] ) are integrated in time for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "let us assume that , following the particles dynamics , the current @xmath53 remains constant during one integration cycle , and the density evolves linearly from @xmath64 to @xmath52 . in this case , on the interval",
    "@xmath45 the electromagnetic equations can be written as : @xmath65 can be integrated in time analytically , which allows to obtain the fields at @xmath48 as : @xmath66 where vector @xmath67 contains the known variables , and the integration coefficients are :    @xmath68    on any interval , when @xmath32 and @xmath31 can be assumed constant , [ maxwell5 ] is the exact solution of the maxwell equations .",
    "the physical precision of such solution is independent of @xmath0 , but is defined solely by the accuracies of the initial and boundary conditions .",
    "this is a principal advantage of the developed psatd method along with the high accuracy of spatial derivatives achieved in spectral calculations .",
    "[ [ charge - continuity . ] ] charge continuity .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the simulations , [ maxwell5 ] relies on the charge density and current , which are calculated via the weighted projections of macro - particles positions and velocities onto the grid .",
    "the numerical errors , produced in such projections , typically dominate the overall accuracy of the model , and should be considered with care .",
    "one issue related to the projection errors in pic , is that the continuity equation , @xmath69 may be not satisfied with the sufficient precision .",
    "consequently , the violation of charge continuity leads to violation of the poisson equation , @xmath70 , and the magnetic monopoles absence condition , @xmath71 . considering the series of [ maxwell5 ]",
    ", one may show that : @xmath72 where the term in the rightmost side corresponds to the continuity equation [ continuity_eq ] .",
    "the produced errors tend to accumulate , and the unphysical electric and magnetic fields may develop .    commonly in the pic methods , the charge continuity is assured by either correcting the deposed current @xcite , or by using the charge - conserving deposition techniques @xcite .",
    "the proper current correction may be introduced as , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 satisfies , @xmath75 . in the fourier space ,",
    "this correction becomes a simple algebraic operation , which makes this approach especially convenient in the spectral methods @xcite . in the developed scheme ,",
    "the current correction reads : @xmath76 and in contrast to the pure fourier approach , differential operations in [ poiss_chk1 ] are not linear in the fourier - bessel space , but involve matrix operations . in the simulations ,",

    "the vertical boundaries are periodic , as imposed by the fourier transform , and the horizontal boundary , @xmath77 , is chosen to be reflective ( cf [ appendix1 ] ) . in the situations , when these conditions do not correspond to the physical model , it is often possible to assume the unbounded media , i.e. sufficiently large simulation domain , so that the interaction does not reach the boundaries . in the cases , when such approximation can not be provided ,",
    "the absorbing boundaries can be produced by multiplying the concerned values by the evanescent envelopes ( for an example , see @xcite ) .    in beam - plasma interactions , the domain of interest",
    "may often be restricted to the area around a laser or particle beam , which travels through the plasma . in this case",
    ", we may apply the unbounded media model by considering the simulation domain , which covers the interaction region , and co - propagates with it .",
    "obviously , such _ moving window _ technique requires the fields at the downstream boundary to be suppressed in order to prevent their upstream translation . in our scheme ,",
    "when using the moving window , after each shift of the simulation domain we multiply @xmath42 and @xmath78 with a profile function , which is equal to unity everywhere but in a narrow layer near the boundary , where it is evanescent .",
    "we have tested the profiles : @xmath79 for suppression of @xmath42 , and @xmath80 for a less perturbing suppression of @xmath78 . for this operation ,",

    "this makes the proposed approach advantageous in a wide class of problems , where co - propagation of relativistic particles and light is involved , e.g. simulations of the wakefield accelerators .",
    "the developed model was implemented in the code plares - pic , which was tested and benchmarked against the quasi - cylindrical fdtd pic code calder - circ .",

    "<S> a new spectral particle - in - cell ( pic ) method for plasma modeling is presented and discussed . in the proposed scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the fourier - bessel transform is used to translate the maxwell equations to the quasi - cylindrical spectral domain . in this domain , </S>",
    "<S> the equations are solved analytically in time , and the spatial derivatives are approximated with high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the finite - difference time domain ( fdtd ) methods that are commonly used in pic , the developed method does not produce numerical dispersion , and does not involve grid staggering for the electric and magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> these features are especially valuable in modeling the wakefield acceleration of particles in plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed algorithm is implemented in the code plares - pic , and the test simulations of laser plasma interactions are compared to the ones done with the quasi - cylindrical fdtd pic code calder - circ . </S>"
