    "the study of many - body phenomena in nanoscale systems is attracting a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "progress in nanotechnology made it possible to construct nanodevices such as quantum dots ( qd s ) which act as ideal one - impurity systems in which the kondo physics is clearly displayed @xcite .",
    "the spectral density of localized electrons of a magnetic impurity in a metallic host , described by the impurity anderson model @xcite , is known to display a resonance near the fermi energy in the localized ( or kondo ) regime @xcite .",
    "the conductance through a qd is proportional to this density and calculations of the latter using the wilson renormalization group leads to a good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the density of localized electrons , the density of conduction electrons coupled to the former shows a dip or fano antiresonance @xcite ( see section 3 ) .",
    "using the fact that the tip of the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) captures essentially conduction electrons , fano line shapes have been observed using scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) for different cases of magnetic impurities on metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "they should also manifest in the conductance through quantum wires side - coupled to qd s @xcite .",
    "the impurity anderson model also describes the physics of the conductance through arrays of qd s weakly coupled to conducting leads @xcite .",
    "a quantum corral is an area of about 40 nm@xmath4 delimited by a closed line of typically several tenths of atoms or molecules placed next to each other one at a time on an atomically flat metallic surface using a stm .",
    "the same microscope can be used to perform sts to study with mev resolution the electronic density inside these corrals @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting are the ( 111 ) surfaces of cu , au and ag .",
    "these metals have nearly spherical fermi surfaces with eight necks at the [ 111 ] and equivalent directions in which a gap opens .",
    "this allows the presence of shockley states localized at the ( 111 ) surface uncoupled to the bulk states for small wave vector parallel to the surface and with nearly free electron dispersion @xcite .",
    "sts experiments performed on these surfaces reveal fascinating standing - wave patterns and one can see the density coming from the wave functions obtained solving the schrdinger equation for a two - dimensional free electron gas inside a hard - wall corral @xcite",
    ". experiments in which different atoms or molecules were used to build the corral ( co , fe , s , co ) suggest that the details of the boundaries are not important for the physics .",
    "a continuous description of the boundary is justified by the fact that the fermi wave length @xmath5 nm is larger than the distance between adatoms . however , as discussed in section 6 , the corrals are leaky and the hard - wall assumption should be abandoned for a quantitative description .    the experiment of the quantum mirage is a beautiful combination of the physics of the quantum corral and the many - body kondo effect .",
    "one co atom acting as a magnetic impurity is placed at the focus of an elliptical corral built on the cu(111 ) surface , and a fano dip is observed not only at the place of the impurity , but remarkably also at the empty focus with reduced magnitude @xcite .",
    "variants of this experiment involving other corral shapes and more that one impurity were presented in a conference @xcite . in the original experiment ,",
    "the space dependence of @xmath6 , the differential conductance after subtracting the corresponding result without impurity , clearly resembles the density of the state number 42 in increasing order of energy of free electrons in a hard - wall elliptical corral .",
    "this suggests that the main features of this space dependence can be explained by a one - body calculation .",
    "in fact , important features , like the possibility of obtaining mirages out of the foci can be understood by a simple tight - binding calculation @xcite or from green functions using hard - wall eigenstates @xcite .",
    "interesting effects like anti mirages were predicted for a non - magnetic impurity inside a hard - wall elliptical corral @xcite , and quantum mirages in s - wave superconductors were calculated @xcite .",
    "also phenomenological scattering theories in which the energy dependence of the kondo resonance ( directly related with the voltage dependence of @xmath7 ) as well as an inelastic part of the scattering are taken from experiment , are able to describe quantitatively the space dependence @xcite .",
    "however , the calculation of the line shape of @xmath7 , its dependence on the particular geometry of the corral , temperature or magnetic field , and the effects of interaction between impurities is out of the scope of these one - body approaches .",
    "the first calculation of the voltage dependence of @xmath7 has been done by one of us using perturbation theory in the coulomb repulsion of the anderson model @xmath3 @xcite a many - body calculation of the mirage effect is a challenge due to the particular nature of the conduction states brought by the confinement in the corral . in particular ,",
    "available exact results for thermodynamic properties of the kondo and anderson impurities , obtained with the bethe ansatz , assume a constant density of conduction states @xcite , while the wilson renormalization group @xcite ( which allows accurate calculation of dynamical properties and was used in the context of nanoscopic systems and sts @xcite ) , requires high symmetry around the impurity . if only a finite number of hard - wall eigenstates with well defined energies are mixed with the impurity ( a problem that can be treated with exact diagonalization @xcite ) , the line shape of @xmath6 becomes qualitatively wrong ( see section 6 ) .",
    "the reason is that the separation of the relevant energy levels is large in comparison with the kondo temperature @xmath8 k , while one knows that for a well developed kondo resonance to exist , @xmath9 should be larger than the average separation of the relevant levels @xcite .",
    "this points to the need of including a finite width of the corral eigenstates , which become resonances @xcite .",
    "this need persists in presence of direct hybridization of the impurity with bulk states as shown in section 6 @xcite .",
    "the width of the resonances can not be too large because otherwise the space dependence of the state 42 of the elliptical corral , observed in @xmath10 @xcite would be blurred .",
    "a subject of current interest and debate in the literature is the relative importance of the hybridization of the impurity with bulk @xmath11 and surface @xmath12 states .",
    "a first principles calculation seems not possible because of the large supercells needed .",
    "they should contain more than 10 layers perpendicular to the [ 111 ] direction in order for the shockley surface state to develop , and more than 100 atoms per layer to reach the dilute limit of co impurities on the surface @xcite . on the basis of the rapid decay in @xmath6 as the stm tip",
    "is moved away from an impurity on a clean ( 111 ) surface , and a jellium theory of plihal and gadzuk @xcite , knorr _",
    "_ concluded that bulk states dominate the formation of the kondo singlet @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with tight - binding calculations @xcite .",
    "however , recently lin , castro neto and jones , using a nearly free electron approximation , including the effect of the gaps in the [ 111 ] and equivalent directions and calculating the wave functions under an adequate surface potential , concluded that the kondo effect in the cu(111 ) surface is dominated by surface states @xcite .",
    "they also obtained good agreement with experiment for the distance dependence of the amplitude of @xmath7 and its voltage dependence on top of the impurity . using a similar approach , but without attempting to solve the many - body problem , merino and gunnarsson concluded that surface states play an important role in the differential conductance for a system with a magnetic impurity on a clean ( 111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "therefore , the issue of the relative importance of @xmath11 and @xmath12 remains unclear .",
    "in contrast , in absence of the impurity , the relative contribution of the surface states to the conductance ( stm tip - substrate hybridization ) is known to be between 1/2 and 2/3 from experiments in which the bias voltage is swept below the bottom of the surface band ( @xmath13 ev below the fermi energy ) @xcite .    since from the experiments we know",
    "that the presence of the corral strongly affects electronic structure of the surface states , it is clear that the variation of the line shape of @xmath7 for different corrals or positions of the impurity inside the corral and its comparison with theory should help to elucidate the relative role of the hybridization of the impurity with surface and bulk states .",
    "a stronger sensitivity to the geometry implies a greater participation of the surface states in the formation of the kondo resonance .",
    "also the interaction between magnetic impurities inside a quantum corral should increase with the relative importance of surface states @xcite .",
    "unfortunately only the voltage dependence of @xmath7 for a co atom on a clean cu(111 ) surface and on an elliptical corral built on that surface is available for comparison @xcite .",
    "using perturbation theory in @xmath3 both line shapes are qualitatively explained without bulk states @xcite ( see section 8) . however , as we will show , this seems to be a particular case and usually the shape and width of the fano dip are more sensitive to the geometry .    in this work",
    "we discuss the main aspects of the physics of the quantum mirage .",
    "the emphasis is on the basic understanding of the phenomenon and its many - body aspects rather than on quantitative fits .",
    "the latter would require more detailed knowledge of matrix elements and their wave vector dependence , crystal fields and other details .",
    "we extend previous many - body calculations for the space and voltage dependence of @xmath6 to new different situations .",
    "this can serve as a basis for comparison with experiment and help to elucidate the relative participation of surface and bulk states in the formation of the kondo singlet for a co atom on a cu(111 ) surface .",
    "we use three different many - body techniques : perturbation theory in @xmath3 @xcite , exact diagonalization plus embedding @xcite and a slave - boson mean - field approximation ( sbmfa ) @xcite .",
    "the former two have already been applied to the quantum mirages @xcite but have the disadvantage that they do not reproduce the correct exponential dependence of @xmath9 with the coupling constant for large @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the resonance level width @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sbmfa is more appropriate to study the dependence of the width of the resonance on geometry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the impurity anderson model for either the corral or open surfaces , and discuss its assumptions and limitations .",
    "section 3 discusses the kondo resonance and fano antiresonance in the simplest version of the model for later comparison . the formalism and basic equations that determine the tunneling current are presented in section 4 , using a many - body formalism , including tunneling of the tip of the stm with surface , bulk and impurity states .",
    "section 5 is rather technical and explains the different many - body approaches . in section 6 we explain the effects of the confinement on the surface states , and how they are transmitted to the kondo resonance and the line shape of the mirage effect .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the space dependence of the differential conductance @xmath7 inside an elliptical quantum corral , the effect of the impurity on it ( @xmath6 ) , and the relation of these quantities with the wave functions of the surface states inside the corral .",
    "this brings insight into the effect of the width of the surface states and what controls the intensity at the mirage point . in section 8",
    "we present results for the dependence of @xmath6 on bias voltage in different situations : clean surface , elliptical corrals and a circular corral . in section 9",
    "we estimate a lower bound for the participation of surface states in the kondo resonance . in section 10 the interaction between two anderson impurities inside an elliptical corral is discussed .",
    "section 11 contains a summary and a discussion .",
    "in this section , we explain and discuss the model used to describe the electronic structure of a system composed of one magnetic impurity interacting with surface and bulk states .",
    "the case of two impurities is left for section 10 .",
    "the surface states can correspond to eigenstates of a clean perfect surface , or to a surface with a soft - wall corral . in both cases ,",
    "the energy spectrum of the surface states is continuous .",
    "the wave functions @xmath16 of the surface eigenstates are normalized in a large area @xcite . of course , all physical results are independent of this area .    we take only one localized @xmath17 orbital for the impurity .",
    "technically it renders some many - body techniques easier ( except the sbmfa ) .",
    "previously jsghy _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite assumed a fully degenerate ground state while other recent calculations for impurities on ( 111 ) surfaces considered the @xmath18 orbital more important @xcite .",
    "tight binding calculations suggest that cu(111 ) surface states hybridize more strongly with the co @xmath19 orbital , while bulk states prefer @xmath20 and @xmath21 orbitals @xcite .",
    "recent accurate calculations using the wilson renormalization group indicate that for the expected filling of near one @xmath17 hole per co impurity , the kondo resonance becomes strongly asymmetric in the orbitally degenerate case @xcite .",
    "then , one would expect in this case also a strongly asymmetric @xmath6 in contrast to the experimental observations for the ( 111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "we neglect the @xmath22 orbitals of the impurity .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are creation operators for an electron in the @xmath26 surface ( bulk ) conduction eigenstate in the absence of the impurity , but including the corral if present .",
    "the impurity is placed at the two - dimensional position @xmath27 on the surface , and we assume that the hybridization of the impurity @xmath17 orbital with the surface state @xmath28 is proportional to its normalized wave function at that point @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "similarly for the bulk states , the hybridization is proportional to some average @xmath30 of the bulk wave function in the direction normal to the surface , that depends on @xmath27 :    @xmath31    where @xmath0 , @xmath1 are energies representing local hybridizations in a tight - binding model @xcite ( see next section ) and @xmath32   is the square root of the surface per cu atom of a cu(111 ) surface .",
    "we assume also a constant density of bulk states .",
    "however , we must warn that recent calculations obtain a significant dependence of the matrix elements with wave vector @xcite .",
    "this dependence affects the line shape of @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , one expects that the _ trends _ in the modifications of the voltage dependence of @xmath7 due to the modifications of the geometry remain the same , at least on a qualitative level .",
    "this is also suggested by the weak dependence of the results on the cutoff for the surface states @xmath33 , which should be introduced in any theory of quantum corrals to avoid divergences in the green s functions for the surface states .",
    "this can be though as an energy dependent hybridization @xmath0 which is constant below @xmath33 and goes to zero abruptly at @xmath34 .",
    "a linearly decreasing @xmath0 has also been used @xcite .",
    "increasing @xmath34 leads to a weak increase in the width of the resonances and to a more asymmetric line shape , but the main conclusions regarding the mirage effect are not altered .",
    "the many - body part of the hamiltonian which renders it non - trivial in all cases is the on - site coulomb repulsion at the impurity site @xmath3 .",
    "another difficulty is the calculation of the surface wave functions @xmath35 for soft walls .",
    "they have been calculated exactly for a soft circular corral @xcite and can be reasonably well approximated for an elliptical corral @xcite .",
    "we return to this point in section 6 . for open structures",
    ", the surface green s function can be calculated using scattering theory @xcite . however",
    ", this renders the many - body problem too difficult .",
    "before discussing the many - body techniques and the effect of the corral , we want to illustrate some basic features of the kondo physics , using the simplest case of the anderson model in which the impurity is hybridized with only one band ( either surface or bulk ) with constant density of states @xmath36 and wave vector independent hybridization .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) eliminating the terms with @xmath37 , considering that the @xmath25 create bloch waves , ( @xmath38 , where @xmath39 creates an electron at site @xmath40 with position @xmath41 ) and taking @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of sites .",
    "then , the impurity is hybridized with the band at one site that we call @xmath44 .",
    "the impurity spectral density @xmath45 of this model has been calculated accurately using wilson renormalization group @xcite and agree qualitatively with those of perturbation theory in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the results presented in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) were obtained using a self - consistent approach @xcite based on an interpolation for the self energy of the green s function between the expression up to second order perturbation theory in the coulomb repulsion @xmath3 @xcite and the exact result for @xmath46 .",
    "the resonant level width is @xmath47 .",
    "this approximation works well for @xmath48 @xcite .    2.0 cm 0.4 cm    as seen in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , @xmath45 shows characteristic charge fluctuation peaks ( or shoulders for small @xmath3 ) at @xmath49 and @xmath50 and another peak near the fermi energy @xmath51 characteristic of the kondo regime .",
    "this peak is the so called kondo resonance .",
    "its half width at half maximum corresponds to the kondo temperature @xmath9 . at temperatures above",
    "@xmath9 the kondo effect disappears and the spectral weight of the kondo peak is transferred to the other two .",
    "the sts is much more sensitive to the conduction electrons than to the localized ones because the former are more extended in space and reach the tip of the stm with a larger amplitude .",
    "the site most affected by the impurity is the one which hybridizes with it ( @xmath44 ) . using equations of motion ( in the same way as done in the next section )",
    ", it is easy to show that the green function at this site is ( the spin index is dropped for simplicity )    @xmath52 ^{2}g_{d}(\\omega ) ,   \\label{gsimple}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is the corresponding green s function in the absence of the impurity and @xmath54 is the green s function of the impurity .",
    "this equation is exact and does not depend on the approximations for @xmath55 .",
    "if the unperturbed conduction band extends from @xmath56 to @xmath57 then    @xmath58 @xmath9 and we are interested in energies @xmath59 , we can neglect the first term inside the brackets and approximate @xmath60 . replacing this in eq .",
    "( [ gsimple ] ) and using @xmath61/\\pi $ ] one obtains the very simple result    @xmath62    thus a peak in @xmath45 implies a dip in the conduction density of states and more pronounced near the impurity ( see fig . 1 ( b ) ) . in more complex situations , in particular when confinement due to the corral is important , the real part of @xmath53 can not be neglected and the dip in @xmath63 is not directly related with the kondo peak in @xmath45 . in extreme cases , either the dip is replaced by a peak @xcite or the structure near @xmath51 disappears , as we will show in section 6 .    in any case , the above simple picture corresponds to a first rough approximation of the experimental observations of the voltage dependence of @xmath10 for impurities on the ( 111 ) surfaces of cu and noble metals , and we will use it for later comparison .",
    "in this section we write the basic equations which relate @xmath7 with the green s function at the impurity site .",
    "we include the hopping of the tip of the stm with the impurity , surface and bulk states in a many - body formalism .",
    "the tunneling geometry and energy diagram is shown for example in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , but the impurity should be included if the tunneling current is measured near it @xcite , and also the bulk states according to experiment @xcite .    the total system @xmath64 consists of a subsystem @xmath65 described by the hamiltonian @xmath66 [ eq . ( [ ham ] ) ] and",
    "@xmath67 contains the tip , which we assume can be described as a non - interacting system with one - particle energies @xmath68 and the fermi energy set at zero .",
    "@xmath65 has all one particle energies , including the fermi level , displaced by @xmath69 to lower energies by a bias voltage @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the elementary charge . for simplicity",
    "we treat the case of positive @xmath70 in which electrons are transferred from the tip to @xmath65 .",
    "extension to negative @xmath70 is trivial using an electron - hole transformation .",
    "we assume a local hopping of the tip with the different states    @xmath72    @xmath73    here @xmath74 creates an electron in the tip eigenstate @xmath75 with spin @xmath76 , @xmath77 describes the coordinates of the tip on the plane , and @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are parameters that describe the hopping of the tip with the different states of @xmath65 .",
    "the function @xmath81 is small and decays strongly with the distance between the tip and the impurity @xmath82 due to the strongly localized nature of the impurity wave function .",
    "however , when @xmath83 , a small @xmath80 introduces an important source of asymmetry in the line shape of @xmath7 in addition to that corresponding to the structure of the green s functions ( see section 8) .    treating @xmath84 in lowest order in perturbation theory and at @xmath85 , using fermi s golden rule , the current due to the transfer of electrons from @xmath67 to @xmath65 becomes    @xmath86    where @xmath87 , @xmath88 are the eigenstates and energies of @xmath64 and @xmath89 is the ground state assumed non degenerate .",
    "using the same notation with a subscript @xmath66 for @xmath65 , we have @xmath90 with the product restricted to @xmath75 such that @xmath91 .",
    "replacing above and doing the calculations within @xmath67 one has    @xmath92    using the lehman representation @xcite , the sum over @xmath93 is seen to represent the part of the spectral density @xmath94 of @xmath95 for electron addition .",
    "this corresponds to excitations above @xmath51 with positive argument of @xmath96 @xcite . by symmetry",
    "it is independent of @xmath76 .",
    "transforming the sum over the tip states @xmath75 as an integral assuming a constant density of states @xmath97 one gets    @xmath98    from here , it is clear that the differential conductance is proportional to the spectral density of the state @xmath99 :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the green s function of @xmath102",
    ". therefore , in the rest of the paper we will be mainly concerned on the space and energy dependence of @xmath103 .",

    "12 we show the line shape expected in a smaller elliptical corral , with semimajor axis reduced to @xmath144 nm keeping the same eccentricity @xmath143 , so that the state 35 ( see fig . 10 ) falls at the fermi energy .",
    "this state has extrema at positions @xmath322 , and the average separation of the levels is larger than in the previous case .",
    "the surface spectral density near the fermi level is larger at @xmath323 than at the foci @xmath324 . even including the same hybridization strength of the impurity with surface and bulk states , the depth and width of @xmath6 is substantially larger if the impurity is placed at @xmath323 rather than at the foci .",
    "note also that the intensity with the tip at the opposite point @xmath325 is considerable larger in this case .",
    "this is due to the fact that the negative interference between states 42 and 35 explained in the previous case is substantially reduced .",
    "a stronger mirage in this geometry has been predicted before @xcite .    in the rest of this section",
    ", we show results for the line shape for the tip placed on the impurity and several positions of the impurity inside a circular corral of radius @xmath326 nm , in such a way that the degenerate states 37 and 38 lie at the fermi level .",
    "experiments in this corral have been done to illustrate the simultaneous presence of two mirages @xcite .",
    "we use the sbmfa , because it gives the correct exponential dependence of @xmath327 with the coupling constant @xcite .",

    "3.0 cm    2.0 cm 0.4 cm    in absence of the impurity , the density of surface conduction electrons at the fermi energy has a pronounced relative maximum near @xmath328 @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "13 ( a ) , the depth and width of @xmath6 varies considerably as the impurity and stm  tip are moved together from the center of the corral to this maximum . at the center , only the corral surface states with angular momentum projection @xmath329 can hybridize with the impurity . since the corresponding resonances are far from the fermi level ( see fig .",
    "14 ) , the fano antiresonance for @xmath330 is more than 80% due to bulk states .",
    "in fact , doing the same calculation with @xmath313 ( assuming no hopping between tip and bulk states , see eqs .",
    "( [ h ] ) and ( [ gh ] ) ) , @xmath331ev .",
    "therefore for @xmath330 the bulk states play a major role not only in the formation of the kondo state but also in the variation of the stm current @xmath310 which is mainly _ due to the current between tip and bulk states_. at remote positions this fano antiresonance of bulk states will not be observed @xcite . in general , the contribution to the dip in @xmath332 due to bulk states ( and interference with surface states ) , captured at the impurity by the hybridization of tip and bulk states , will be absent at a mirage point and is a natural limitation of the intensity at the mirage point ( see next section ) . for @xmath333 ,",
    "the intensity of @xmath6 decreases to @xmath112 40% if the tip - bulk hopping is disconnected .",
    "compared with the rapid variation for @xmath334 , the width and magnitude of @xmath6 oscillates weakly with position for @xmath335 @xmath336 , with larger intensity and width for @xmath337 , 0.65 , and 0.85 ( see fig .",
    "however , there is a dramatic increase for @xmath338 , with a maximum near 0.96 , as shown in fig .",
    "although unfortunately at this short distances from the boundary our theory ceases to be reliable ( because of our simple assumption of a continuous boundary potential ) , it is instructive to relate this result with the variation of the density of surface states @xmath339 at the fermi energy @xmath153 with position . as shown in fig .",
    "14 , there is a moderate increase in @xmath339 near @xmath340 as @xmath341 increases from 0.15 to 0.95 .",
    "this is mainly due to the contribution of resonances with high angular momentum projection which render @xmath342 rather flat in energy . instead , for @xmath343 , the resonances with @xmath329 are selected and they lead to the displayed oscillatory behavior .    2.0 cm    2.0 cm 0.4 cm    the parameters of fig .",
    "13 correspond to an equal participation of bulk and surface states in the resonant level @xmath206 .",
    "considering the case @xmath207 , as expected , the variation of the width of the resonance with the position of the impurity is less pronounced , but otherwise the same qualitative features as before are obtained . except for the peculiar behavior near the boundary of the corral ,",
    "the greater sensitivity to the position is for @xmath344 @xmath345 as before .",
    "comparison between both cases is presented in fig .",
    "15 . in fig . 15 ( a ) and ( b )",
    "we have used an intensity of the boundary potential @xmath346 , which leads to a broadening @xmath347 mev of the surface conduction states at the fermi level ( see section 6 a ) .",
    "this value leads to a space dependence in agreement with experiment ( see section 7 ) . in fig .",
    "15 ( c ) we show how the space variation is affected if the confining potential is increased to @xmath348 , leading to @xmath349 mev .",
    "the oscillations in the surface density of states and therefore the variation of the width of the resonance with position becomes much more pronounced .",
    "there is a tendency to a change in the line shape , similar to that of fig .",
    "6 for @xmath350 mev , which can allow to identify or rule out this regime experimentally . for other positions of the impurity (",

    "within our local picture for the hybridization of the impurity and tip with conduction states , a simple estimate of a lower bound for @xmath2 can be obtained from the mirage experiment in the elliptical quantum corral @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the intensity of @xmath6 at the mirage point @xmath352 ( for the tip position @xmath325 ) to that at the impurity @xmath353 ( for @xmath354 ) was reported to be @xmath355 . as in section 3 , let us approximate @xmath356 .",

    "now , at the mirage point one can neglect @xmath362 @xcite .",
    "assuming instead perfect transmission from the surface states ( as if only the state 42 were relevant ) , one has @xmath363 .",
    "since the amplitude at the mirage point is less than that for perfect transmission , one has from eqs .",

    "using @xmath368 , this implies @xmath369 , with @xmath370 .",
    "a smaller tip - bulk hopping @xmath79 leads to a larger lower bound for @xmath371 .",
    "experiments with two impurities inside an elliptical quantum corral have been done @xcite , but the results were not published yet .",
    "these experiments should be particularly useful as a test of the relative strength of the hybridization of the impurity with bulk and surface states , since one expects that at distances larger than @xmath1120.5 nm , the interaction between two kondo impurities is dominated by surface states . in this section",
    "we extend previous calculations of the line shape of @xmath6 when there is one impurity at each focus of an elliptical corral , using the technique of exact diagonalization plus embedding , described in section 5 c @xcite .",
    "other calculations of the interaction between magnetic impurities in a corral have been made by perturbation theory in the kondo coupling @xcite .",
    "however , this technique does not work in the case we are interested of antiferromagnetic kondo coupling @xmath372 @xcite .",

    "the hilbert space of @xmath217 contains one or two impurities and the most important surface conduction states ( those represented in fig .",
    "10 ) and two additional ones ( 24 and 62 ) although they do not affect the results .",

    "the value of @xmath258 controls the width of the conduction states and therefore , the intensity at the mirage point , as explained in sections 6 and 7 .",
    "3.0 cm    2.0 cm 0.4 cm    in fig .",
    "16 , we represent the change in differential conductance for @xmath293 for the case in which there is one impurity at each focus , comparing two situations . in the first one @xmath147 and @xmath380 ev",
    "is taken to reproduce approximately the experimental width . in the second one @xmath0",
    "is reduced by a factor @xmath300 and @xmath1 increased to 1.2 ev in order that the same width and practically the same line shape is obtained . in the former case ,",
    "the effect of the interaction between impurities is stronger and the line is wider and with some structure due to a partial splitting of the kondo resonance . in the second case ,",
    "the result is very similar to the sum of the spectra at both foci when only one impurity is present .",
    "this is the result expected for weak interactions .",
    "using a simple impurity anderson model in which the particular structure of the surface states inside a corral is taken into account appropriately , the basic physics of the mirage experiments in quantum corrals @xcite can be understood .",
    "the resulting space and voltage dependence of the differential conductance @xmath7 is in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the voltage dependence of @xmath7 observed for one co atom on a clean cu(111 ) surface and for a co atom at the focus of an elliptical corral built on that surface can both be explained with the same set of parameters ( see fig .",
    "while the space dependence of @xmath7 is mainly determined by non - interacting conduction electron green s functions , the calculation of the dependence of @xmath7 on bias voltage is a non trivial many - body problem in which the particular structure of the conduction electrons for surface states introduces additional complications .",
    "single - particle scattering theories were successful in explaining the space dependence of @xmath10 @xcite , but the voltage dependence is actually used to adjust a phenomenological energy dependent phase shift . therefore the differences in the line shape as a function of the applied voltage in different structures ( like the above mentioned between an impurity on a clean surface or inside the corral ) can not by accounted for . in contrast , the many - body treatment is very difficult to implement for open structures , while one - body scattering theory assuming simple interactions , allows not only to calculate but also to optimize open structure to obtain multiple mirages or other desired effects @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", our approach leads to very good agreement with the space dependence of @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "9 ) except perhaps for the finest details which we did not attempt to fit . in addition , it allows to understand the basic observed features , including the mirage effects and its intensity , in terms of the interference of wave functions in the corral ( see section 7 )",
    ".    experiments in which the change in differential conductance after addition of one impurity in a quantum corral @xmath6 is measured should be able to discern the relative importance of surface and bulk states in the formation of the kondo singlet .",
    "measurements in circular corrals , easier to handle theoretically , would be useful .",
    "in section 8 we presented some results for this case .",
    "in addition , the change of @xmath6 when more than one impurity is present in the corral is very sensitive to the surface - impurity hybridization .",
    "the observation of a quantum mirage establishes a lower bound for this hybridization which we have estimated .",
    "the calculations presented here are for @xmath85 .",
    "within perturbation theory , the results can be extended easily to @xmath381 .",
    "some results were presented in ref .",
    "important changes occur in the scale of the kondo temperature , but the behavior is similar to that already known for the simple case explained in section 3 .",
    "an improvement of the many - body theory requires a better knowledge of the hybridization of the impurity with surface and bulk states and their wave vector dependence ( which we have neglected ) .",
    "the wave vector dependence is expected from a jellium model @xcite . in particular for the states near the fermi energy @xmath51 and wave functions decaying as @xmath382 out of the surface , one expects @xmath383 @xmath384 constant and",
    "therefore a smaller wave vector parallel to the surface @xmath385 implies a weaker decay rate @xmath386 in the perpendicular @xmath387 direction , and therefore a larger hybridization with impurity and tip . for surface states near @xmath51",
    ", @xmath388 is small and one would expect a weaker decay for surface than bulk states .",
    "this suggests a stronger relative hybridization of bulk states with the impurity in comparison with the tip , because the former is closer to the surface .",
    "this would be consistent with the fact that the hybridization of the tip with surface and bulk states is of the same order @xcite , and the proposal that bulk states dominate the hybridization with the impurity @xcite .",
    "however , more detailed calculations of the matrix elements found oscillations of the matrix elements with @xmath387 , and a stronger relevance of surface states in the formation of the kondo state @xcite and in the distance dependence of the observed @xmath7 for magnetic impurities on clean ( 111 ) surfaces @xcite .    we have shown that the width of the surface conduction electrons @xmath222 plays a crucial role in the many - body theory ( see section 6 ) . we have calculated this width for a circular confinement potential and found that it increases linearly with energy @xcite .",
    "however , we assumed that for a clean surface the surface states are well defined for all wave vectors and this is not the case for energies above the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "since localization involves a participation of all wave vectors , there is a contribution to the width brought by the states of larger wave vector which we have neglected .",
    "however , since most of the physics depends on the value of @xmath222 at the fermi energy and we took it as a parameter , our conclusions are not affected .",
    "correlation functions of impurities inside a quantum corral have been studied previously @xcite . for perfect confinement",
    "a strong enhancement should occur .",
    "however , for realistic broadening of the surface conduction states , and distances of the order of several nm involved in the mirage experiments , we expect that the single ion physics dominate the rkky interactions , and no significant magnetic correlations are present @xcite .",
