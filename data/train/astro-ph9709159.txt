    "on the other hand , galaxies too faint to be included in a sample of given limiting magnitude are brightened due to lensing and may therefore be included in the sample .",
    "the net effect , known as magnification bias , can go either way : it can lead to an enhancement or suppression of the observed number density of galaxies , depending on the slope of the number - magnitude relation .",

    "we plot @xmath44 as a function of @xmath73 for a foreground galaxy sample at @xmath74 and a background sample at @xmath75 , for the four cosmological models described in section 2.1 .",

    "the price of selecting a subsample is a smaller number of galaxies and therefore larger poisson errors ; so in practice a careful cut suited to the available data would need to be made .",
    "figure  [ wth ] shows that the typical cross - correlation signal expected on sub - arcminute scales is a few percent . on angular scales larger than 1 arcminute",
    "the signal drops to less than a percent . for fixed @xmath49",
    "it is largest for the einstein - de sitter model and smallest for the cosmological constant model , at least on arcminute scales or smaller .",

    "correlation function @xmath83 for a foreground galaxy sample at @xmath74 as a function of the redshift @xmath84 of the background sample .",

    "these figures show the slow increase in the amplitude of the signal with @xmath86 above a redshift of 1 .",
    "there is no significant variation in the shape of the curves among the four cosmological models .",
    "thus if the amplitudes were normalized to the same value at @xmath87 , there would be very little difference between the curves at higher @xmath84 .",
    "the difference between the predictions of the four models shown in figures  [ wth]-[wth02 ] can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "the dominant dependence arises due to the factor of @xmath45 outside the integral in equation  [ omegagl ] for @xmath44 . taking the normalization of the power spectrum into account this",
    "is reduced to @xmath88 for the cluster - abundance normalization of @xmath49 and the bias relation @xmath89 .",
    "this is because the expression for @xmath44 depends explicitly on the factor @xmath90 .",
    "the line - of - sight integral in equation  [ omegagl ] further weakens the dependence on @xmath45 . in a low-@xmath45 universe ,",
    "the growth of perturbations is slowed down at late times .",
    "hence , normalizing to present - day cluster abundances leads to a higher normalization at earlier times compared to the @xmath62 models .",
    "this in turn means that nonlinear effects , which are significant on angular scales of @xmath91 or less , become important earlier on and lead to a larger enhancement due to nonlinear clustering by today .",
    "the nonlinear enhancement is reinforced by a geometrical effect : for lower @xmath45 , and even more so for larger @xmath92 ( for given @xmath45 ) , the physical distance to a given redshift is larger .",
    "this leads to a larger lensing path - length and thus a further increase in the lensing signal .",
    "the combination of all these effects is shown in figure  [ wth ] . on scales well below an arcminute the signal for the open model becomes comparable to that in the einstein - de sitter model .",
    "this is due to the dominance of the nonlinear enhancement on these scales .",
    "the curve for the open model is also distinctly steeper than for the others . for @xmath93",
    ", however , there is no significant variation in the shape of the curves . for the @xmath58dominated model",
    "the effect of the growing mode is not as strong as for the open model .",
    "thus on small scales , even though the geometric effect gives a stronger enhancement than for the open model , the net amplitude of @xmath44 is smaller than for the open model .",
    "finally , note that @xmath44 is proportional to the bias factor of the foreground sample .",
    "if this bias factor is larger or smaller than the value of @xmath76 which we assumed to fit the large  scale structure data , @xmath44 will be correspondingly altered .",
    "we consider two sources of error involved in an observational determination of the cross - correlation from two galaxy samples .",
    "the first potential error arises when a background galaxy is mis - identified as a foreground galaxy . in this case",
    "the auto  correlation of the background galaxy sample will erroneously enter into the measured cross - correlation .",
    "say @xmath94 of the background galaxies redshifts are sufficiently mis - estimated that they are taken to be part of the foreground sample . the observed cross ",
    "correlation is then given by @xmath95 where the second term is the error made due to assigning galaxies to the wrong sample .",
    "it is proportional to the fraction of galaxies which is mis - identified and to @xmath96 , the auto ",
    "correlation function evaluated at the mean redshift of the background sample , for the redshift distribution of eq .  [ nz ] .",
    "we have calculated the auto  correlation at @xmath91 and scaled it to @xmath97 assuming a power law slope of @xmath98 ; @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the number of galaxies in the foreground and background samples .    in figure  [ wmiss ]",
    "we plot the cross - correlation @xmath83 ( lower set of matching curves ) together with the measured cross - correlation function @xmath101 ( upper set of matching curves ) .",
    "two values of @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are used ( for samples of equal size ) .",
    "the results show that for @xmath105 the error is small for @xmath106 but not when @xmath107 .",
    "this sets an approximate standard required for using photometric redshifts or other possible methods to select the two galaxy samples .",
    "a second source of error is the statistical uncertainty in estimating the angular correlations .",
    "using a poisson distribution to estimate the error in @xmath108 provides a rough guide for the number of galaxies required to estimate the cross - correlation signal .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath109 in the estimate of @xmath110 for a random distribution of objects is given by ( peebles 1980 ) @xmath111 where @xmath4 is the solid angle subtended by the survey area , and @xmath112 is the fraction in the bin used for angle @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath113 is just the inverse of the number of pairs in a given bin in @xmath73 .    for a sample with about @xmath114 galaxies per @xmath115 degree@xmath116",
    "( e.g. as in each field of woods & fahlman ( 1997 ) whose sample reaches limiting magnitudes of @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) , the above estimate gives @xmath120 if 10 bins in @xmath73 are used .",
    "thus in excess of about @xmath114 galaxies each in the foreground and background sample would be required for a detection of a @xmath121 cross - correlation signal with a high level of significance .",
    "we have presented results for the cross - correlation of two galaxy samples with different redshift distributions .",
    "the signal is dominated by the effect of magnification bias due to weak lensing . to ensure that the contribution from gravitational clustering of the galaxies is negligible",
    ", we have assumed that the redshift distributions of the two samples do not overlap . with the use of photometric redshifts (",
    "e.g. connolly et al .",
    "1995 ; sawicki , lin & yee 1997 ) , it is feasible to obtain deep galaxy samples that can be separated into sub - samples with desired redshift distributions .",
    "if only limiting magnitudes are used to create two sub - samples , then there will be a significant overlap and the interpretation of the signal is not as clean .",
    "theoretical predictions can however be made for the expected signal assuming a redshift distribution .",
    "the results shown in figures 1 - 3 demonstrate that most models predict a signal of 1 - 4% for the cross - correlation function .",
    "these numbers apply for a background sample with a mean redshift @xmath122 and a number count slope of @xmath81 , on angular scales from a few arcseconds to an arcminute .",
    "as argued in section 4 , the measurement of such a signal appears feasible in the near future .",
    "the cross - correlation function is a measure of the projected dark matter power spectrum . for a given spectrum ,",
    "the variation with angle on small scales is largest for open cosmological models and thus provides a probe of @xmath4 .",
    "the cross - correlation however is also proportional to the bias factor of the foreground ( @xmath123 ) galaxy sample .",
    "thus there is a degeneracy in the dependance on the cosmological model and the biasing of intermediate redshift galaxies .",
    "the bias factor can vary with the redshift of the foreground sample and with @xmath4 . given a model or empirical measure of the bias factor",
    ", the cross - correlation can be used as a probe of the power spectrum and @xmath4 .",
    "else , for a given cosmology , it can constrain the bias factor of galaxies . ideally , by combining the cross - correlation with other lensing measures which are independent of bias , such as the ellipticity auto  correlation function , constraints on the cosmological model as well as on the biasing of galaxies at intermediate redshifts can be obtained .",
