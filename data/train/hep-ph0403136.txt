    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 radiative decay to @xmath10 ( baryon and antibaryon pair ) is a good channel to study the possible bound or resonant states of the @xmath10 system .",
    "abundant @xmath8 and @xmath9 events have been collected at the beijing electron positron collider ( bepc ) .",
    "more data will be collected at upgraded bepc and cleo - c .",
    "based on the analysis of the 58 million @xmath8 events accumulated by the bes2 detector at the bepc , recently bes2 reported @xcite that they observed a strong , narrow enhancement near the threshold in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath0 ( proton - antiproton ) pairs from @xmath11 radiative decays .",
    "the structure has the properties consistent with either an @xmath12- or @xmath13-wave breit - wigner resonance function . in the s - wave case ,",
    "the peak mass is blow @xmath14 around @xmath15 with a total width @xmath16 .in order to get more useful information about properties of the resonances such as their @xmath17 quantum numbers , mass , width , production and decay rates , etc . , partial wave analyses ( pwa ) are necessary .",
    "pwa is an effective method for analysing the experimental data of hadron spectrum .",
    "there are two types of pwa : one is based on the covariant tensor ( also named rarita - schwinger ) formalism@xcite and the other is based on the helicity formalism@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite showed the connection between the covariant tensor formalism and the covariant helicity one .",
    "ref.@xcite provided pwa formulae in a covariant tensor formalism for @xmath1 decays to mesons , which have been used for a number of channels already published by bes@xcite and are going to be used for more channels .",
    "a similar approach has been used in analyzing other reactions@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite provided explicit formulae for the angular distribution of photon of the @xmath1 radiative decays in the covariant tensor formalism , and also discussed helicity formalism of the angular distribution of the @xmath1 radiative decays to two pseudoscalar mesons , and its relation to the covariant tensor formalism .",
    "now we extend the covariant tensor formalism to the @xmath18 with b represents baryons @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 etc , and derive the decay amplitudes for various intermediate resonant states in the framework of the relativistic covariant tensor formalism .",
    "in this paper we study the phenomenological spin parity determination of resonances .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows : in section 2 , we present the necessary tools for the calculation of the tensor amplitudes , within a covariant tensor formalism . this will allow us to derive covariant amplitudes for all possible processes . in section 3 , we present covariant tensor formalism for @xmath1 radiative decays to baryon antibaryon pairs .",
    "since covariance is a general requirement of any decay amplitude , all possible amplitudes are written in terms of covariant tensor form .",
    "all amplitudes include a complex coupling constant and blatt - weisskopf centrifugal barriers where necessary . in section 3",
    ", we provide the angular distribution of the photon and proton .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "in this section we present the necessary tools for the construction of covariant tensor amplitudes .",
    "the partial wave amplitudes @xmath23 in the covariant rarita - schwinger tensor formalism can be constructed by using pure orbital angular momentum covariant tensors @xmath24 and covariant spin wave functions @xmath25 together with metric tensor @xmath26 , totally antisymmetric levi - civita tensor @xmath27 and momenta of parent particles . for a process",
    "@xmath28 , if there exists a relative orbital angualar momentum @xmath29 between the particle a and b , then the pure orbital angular momentum @xmath29 state can be represented by covariant tensor wave functions @xmath24@xcite which is built out of relative momentum .",
    "thus here we give only covariant tensors that correspond to the pure s- , p- , d- , and f - wave orbital angular momenta : @xmath30b_2(q_{abc } ) , \\\\\\label{l3 } \\tilde t^{(3)}_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda } & = & [ \\tilde r_\\mu\\tilde r_\\nu\\tilde r_\\lambda -{1\\over 5}(\\tilde r\\cdot\\tilde r)(\\tilde g_{\\mu\\nu}(p_a)\\tilde r_\\lambda + \\tilde g_{\\nu\\lambda}(p_a)\\tilde r_\\mu+\\tilde g_{\\lambda\\mu}(p_a)\\tilde r_\\nu)]b_3(q_{abc } ) , \\\\ & & \\cdots   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the relative four momentum of the two decay products in the parent particle rest frame ; @xmath32 . and @xmath33 @xmath34 is a blatt - weisskopf barrier factor@xcite ,",
    "here @xmath35 is the magnitude of @xmath36 or @xmath37 in the rest system of @xmath38 , @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "the spin-1 and spin-2 particles wave functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 satisfy the following conditions @xmath43 and @xmath44    note that for a given decay process @xmath28 , the total angular momentum should be conserved , which means @xmath45 where @xmath46 in addition parity should also be conserved , which means @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the intrinsic parities of particles @xmath38 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , respectively . from this relation ,",
    "one knows whether @xmath53 should be even or odd . then from eq .",
    "( [ conservation ] ) one can find out how many different @xmath54 combinations , which determine the number of independent couplings . also note that in the construction of the covariant tensor amplitude , for @xmath55 coupling , if @xmath56 is an odd number , then @xmath57 with @xmath58 the momentum of the parent particle is needed ; otherwise it is not needed .",
    "the general form of the decay @xmath59 amplitude can be written as follows by using the polarization four - vectors of the initial and final states , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the polarization four vector of the @xmath1 with spin projection of @xmath62 ; @xmath63 is the polarization four vector of the photon with spin projections of @xmath64 ; @xmath65 is the @xmath66-th partial wave amplitude with coupling strength determined by a complex parameter @xmath67 .",
    "the spin-1 polarization vector @xmath61 for @xmath1 with four momentum @xmath68 satisfies @xmath69 with @xmath70 . here",
    "the minkowsky metric tensor has the form @xmath71 for @xmath1 production from @xmath72 annihilation , the electrons are highly relativistic , with the result that @xmath73 for the @xmath1 spin projection taking the beam direction as the z - axis .",
    "this limits @xmath62 to 1 and 2 , i.e. components along @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "then one has the following relation @xmath76 for the photon polarization four vector , there is the usual lorentz orthogonality conditions .",
    "namely , the polarization four vector @xmath63 of the photon with momenta @xmath77 satisfies @xmath78 which states that spin-1 wave function is orthogonal to its own momentum .",
    "the above relation is the same as for a massive vector meson .",
    "however , for the photon , there is an additional gauge invariance condition .",
    "here we assume the coulomb gauge in the @xmath1 rest system , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath79",
    ". then we have @xcite @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 . for",
    "@xmath83 , the total spin of @xmath0 system can be either @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "these two states can be represented by @xmath1 and @xmath86 @xcite . where @xmath87 one can see that both @xmath1 and @xmath86 have no dependence on the direction of the momentum @xmath88 , hence correspond to pure spin states with the total spin of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , @xmath92 are momenta and spin of the proton antiproton pairs , respectively . @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the masses of @xmath95 and @xmath19 , @xmath96 , respectively ; @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the standard dirac spinor .",
    "if we sum over the polarization , we have the two projection operators : @xmath99    to compute the differential cross section , we need an expression for @xmath100 .",
    "note that the square modulus of the decay amplitude , which gives the decay probability of a certain configuration should be independent of any particular frame , that is , a lorentz scalar .",
    "thus by using the eqs .",
