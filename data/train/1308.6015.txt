    "a prominent example is optical lattice clocks @xcite , where magnetically insensitive `` clock - state '' atoms are confined by `` magic '' wavelength optical fields .",
    "the addition of coupling terms ( interaction with the environment ) to the free evolution hamiltonian for a two - level system can , however , be turned to an advantage and exploited in metrology applications . in this case",

    "two - level atoms are typically manipulated with quasi - resonant radiation fields , giving rise to dynamics equivalent to a magnetic spin-1/2 particle in a b - field @xcite .",
    "the physics of a two - level atom in a steady field is captured by the well - known rabi solution describing the oscillation of population between the two states , which for an atom initially in its lower energy state takes the following form for the ( single atom ) population inversion @xcite @xmath3 ^ 2\\sin^2\\left[\\omega(\\delta)t/2\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the on - resonance rabi frequency and @xmath5 is the generalized rabi frequency for a field detuned by @xmath6 from the transition frequency .",
    "the on - resonance rabi frequency is the product of the driving field amplitude and the matrix element between the two states for the atom - field interaction , and may hence display spatial variation according to the intensity distribution of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this was recently exploited to map out the magnetic microwave near - field of a coplanar waveguide by means of ultracold @xcite and hot @xcite atomic clouds .",
    "similarly , in the far field of a horn antenna , the effect of a spatially inhomogeneous microwave drive field has also been observed for extended atomic clouds @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the inversion @xmath7 may also acquire a position dependence through a spatial variation of the detuning @xmath6 .",
    "this could , for example , arise from a position dependent differential ac stark shift imposed by a laser beam @xcite or via a nonuniform magnetic field ( zeeman shift ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on dispersive probing of microwave driven rabi oscillations between two zeeman tunable hyperfine states in a prolate sample of ultracold @xmath8rb atoms .",
    "we organize our presentation as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section : background ] we briefly review dispersive probing schemes and their applications , and discuss approaches for imprinting magnetic order in inhomogeneously broadened samples .",

    "cloud leads to an inhomogeneous shift in the resonance .",
    "this in turn gives rise to a decay in rabi oscillations when probed dispersively along its axis .",
    "section  [ section : interplay ] presents examples of such decaying waveforms , which are interpreted in a simple dephasing model and compared to complementary data acquired by means of spatially resolved state - selective absorption imaging .",
    "here we also discuss the small but observable effect the dispersive probe beam has on the atomic sample in terms of a differential light shift , breaking the symmetry for the resulting spin texture .",

    "when a beam of light of well - defined frequency passes through a gas of atoms it may be attenuated as a result of absorption , as well as shifted in phase .",
    "dispersive detection techniques make use of the latter effect and are a very suitable tool for tracking dynamical processes in `` real time '' for cold and ultracold atomic systems . for example",
    ", dispersive probing has been used to follow breathing @xcite and center - of - mass oscillations @xcite , and the process of forced evaporative cooling @xcite for trapped atomic clouds . moreover , coherent phenomena such as rabi oscillations between hyperfine states @xcite , larmor precession @xcite and phase space dynamics of spinor condensates @xcite have been recorded and studied dispersively .",
    "the phase shift measurement is obtained by comparing the phase - shifted beam to a reference beam in either homodyne or heterodyne detection schemes .",
    "for example , the former is achieved in mach - zehnder interferometers @xcite , while the latter is achieved in frequency modulation ( fm ) spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dispersive probing may also take the form of polarization spectroscopy for gases in birefringent states @xcite .",
    "the implementations listed in the preceding paragraph all make use of non - imaging photodetectors , which are generally both faster and less expensive than low noise ccd cameras @xcite , but do , of course , imply that direct spatial information imprinted on the probe light is integrated out .",
    "spatially resolved dispersive imaging techniques for ultracold atoms have been in play since right after the achievement of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , with variants thereof developing subsequently @xcite .",
    "systems with magnetic order are of fundamental importance in condensed - matter physics and an area of substantial interest .",
    "trapped ultracold atomic gases provide a clean and highly flexible experimental test bed where to simulate such systems and have been utilized in many studies over the last 15 years or so to investigate spatial magnetic order by using atomic spin degrees of freedom . the starting point for many such experimental studies in a continuous geometry",
    "is to expose the gas to a spatially varying coupling field , inhomogeneously driving dynamics between spin states .",

    "@xcite used a spatially varying rabi drive to wind up the phase of the order parameter of a two - component @xmath9 condensate and observed the subsequent unwinding owing to its kinetic energy .",
    "the spatial variation of the coupling resulted as a combined effect of the presence of a magnetic field gradient and the accompanying variation of the two - photon rabi frequency .",
    "similar methods were used later to excite dipole topological modes in condensates @xcite , to create spin waves in an ultracold gas above the bec transition @xcite , to observe spatial segregation in both ultracold bose gases @xcite and fermi gases @xcite . very recently , phase - winding in an elongated two - component bec was used to generate dark - bright solitons @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of spin waves has direct relevance to spintronics and spin caloritronics @xcite , and studies have demonstrated universal spin transport in fermi gases near the hydrodynamic regime @xcite and engineered high - quantum number spin waves @xcite .",

    "there has also been substantial interest in studying two - component becs , where spatio - temporal variation of rabi coupling was employed in association with controlling the atomic interactions to study spatial mixing - demixing dynamics @xcite , spin textures following a quench @xcite and non - equilibrium dynamics @xcite .    in the present paper",

    "observed non - exponential washing out of rabi oscillations was described well by a simple model from which a value of the magnetic field gradient could be extracted .",
    "this value for the magnetic field gradient was in excellent correspondence with complementary measurements based on absorption images . for our demonstration",
    "we applied a field gradient of about 500  nt / mm , leading to a center - to - edge change in rabi frequency of @xmath141 from the @xmath142  khz central and on - resonance rabi frequency .",
    "fitting our model function over a time interval @xmath143  ms ( yielding more than 10 cycles ) allows us to determine this gradient to within 25  nt .",

    "the absorption images of prolate clouds at the end of the rabi drive revealed the formation of ( continuous ) magnetic order along the sample similar to previously reported findings @xcite , but also how the small but finite light shift from the dispersive probe breaks the symmetry of the spin patterns .",

    "for example , atoms have recently been used as a scanning `` soft '' probe for measuring the height and position of free - standing carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "experiments of this kind have so far relied on absorption imaging for measuring the atomic loss constituting the meter variable .",
    "dispersive probing strategies hold the promise of vastly improving the data acquisition rate over such destructive detection schemes .",
    "furthermore , atomic clouds have been envisaged for sensing the magnetic field from oscillating micro - mechanical wires carrying a current @xcite .",
    "we believe a rabi driven , dispersively probed , prolate atomic cloud would form an interesting interface to such systems .",
