    "strange mesons are produced below or close to their respective threshold in binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath2 at @xmath3  gev , @xmath4 at @xmath5  gev ) .",
    "the production at these energies requires multiple nucleon - nucleon collisions or secondary collisions like e.g. @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) for the k@xmath0 or the strangeness exchange reaction @xmath8 for the k@xmath1 .",
    "k@xmath0 mesons contain an @xmath9-quark and hence can hardly be absorbed in hadronic matter consisting almost entirely of u- and d - quarks .",
    "the k@xmath1 on the other hand can be reabsorbed via the inverse direction of the strangeness exchange reaction mentioned above .",
    "the experiments were performed with the kaon spectrometer ( kaos ) at the heavy - ion synchrotron ( sis ) at the gsi in darmstadt @xcite .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer has a large acceptance in solid angle and in momentum ( @xmath10  msr , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the particle identification and the trigger are based on separate measurements of the momentum and of the time - of - flight .",
    "the background due to spurious tracks and pile - up is removed by a trajectory reconstruction based on three large - area multi - wire proportional counters .",
    "the short distance of 5 - @xmath12  m from the target to the focal plane minimizes the number of kaon - decays in flight .",
    "the loss of kaons by decay is accounted for by monte carlo simulations using the geant code .",
    "three different collision systems have been investigated ( , , and ) at incident beam energies ranging from @xmath13  agev to @xmath14  agev .",
    "results have been published in @xcite and will in part be presented in this contribution .",
    "section [ eos ] briefly summarizes the results on the excitation function of the k@xmath0 production and the conclusions that can be drawn on the nuclear equation - of - state . in section [ mapart ]",
    "the dependence of the k@xmath0 and of the k@xmath1 production on the collision centrality is discussed .",
    "section [ dynamics ] shows details on energy spectra and polar angle distributions and in section [ azimuthal ] azimuthal distributions for @xmath15 , k@xmath0 , and k@xmath1 are presented .",
    "early transport calculations predicted that the k@xmath0 yield in collisions at beam energies below the production threshold in nucleon - nucleon collisions would be enhanced by a factor of about 2 if a soft rather than a hard equation - of - state is assumed @xcite .",
    "recent calculations take into account modifications of the kaon properties within the dense nuclear medium .",
    "the repulsive k@xmath17n potential assumed depends nearly ( or less than ) linearly on the baryonic density @xcite and thus reduces the k@xmath0 yield accordingly . on the other hand , at subthreshold beam energies",
    "the k@xmath17 mesons are created in secondary collisions involving two or more particles and hence their production depends at least quadratically on the density . to disentangle these two competing effects",
    "we have studied the k@xmath0 production in a light ( ) and in a heavy collision system ( ) at different beam energies near threshold .",
    "the maximum baryonic density reached in reactions is significantly higher than in reactions .",
    "moreover , the maximum baryonic density reached in au+au reactions depends strongly on the compression modulus of nuclear matter @xmath18 @xcite whereas in c+c collisions this dependence is rather weak @xcite .",
    "hence , the ratio of the k@xmath0 multiplicity per nucleon @xmath19 in to the one in is expected to be sensitive to the compression modulus @xmath18 while providing the advantage that uncertainties within the experimental data ( beam normalization etc . ) and within the transport model calculations ( elementary cross sections etc . )",
    "are partly cancelled .",
    "figure [ fig_eos ] shows a comparison of the ratio @xmath20 for k@xmath0 together with the predictions of rqmd transport model calculations @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed with two values for the compression modulus : @xmath21  mev ( solid line ) and @xmath22  mev ( dashed line ) corresponding to a `` soft '' or to a `` hard '' nuclear equation - of - state , respectively .",
    "the rqmd transport model takes into account a repulsive k@xmath17n - potential and uses momentum - dependent skyrme forces to determine the compressional energy per nucleon ( i.e. the energy stored in the compression ) .",
    "the comparison demonstrates clearly that only the calculation based on a soft nuclear equation - of - state reproduces the trend of the experimental data .",
    "a similar result is obtained using the transport code iqmd @xcite .",
    "the centrality of the collision was derived from the multiplicity of charged particles measured in the interval @xmath23 by a hodoscope consisting of 84 plastic - scintillator modules . in order to study the centrality dependence the data measured close to midrapidity ( @xmath24 ) were grouped into five centrality bins both for and for collisions at @xmath25  agev .",
    "the inclusive kaon multiplicity for each centrality bin is defined as @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the kaon production cross section and @xmath28 being the fraction of the reaction cross - section for the particular event class which was determined by normalising the charged particle multiplicity distribution measured with a minimum bias trigger .",
    "the corresponding mean number of participating nucleons for each centrality bin @xmath29 was calculated from the measured reaction cross - section fraction for this bin using a glauber model .",
    "figure [ fig_ratio ] presents the multiplicity per number of participating nucleons @xmath30 as a function of @xmath29 for k@xmath0 , for k@xmath1 , and for pions .",
    "the lines are functions @xmath31 fitted to the data yielding similar values of @xmath32 for k@xmath0 and for k@xmath1 as well in as in and @xmath33 for pions .",
    "the resulting k@xmath1/k@xmath0 ratio is about 0.02 for as well as for and is rather constant as a function of the collision centrality .    at low incident energies the strangeness - exchange reaction @xmath34 plays a key role in the k@xmath1 production . if the rates for the k@xmath1 production are equal to those for the k@xmath1 absorption , this reaction is in chemical equilibrium . in this case",
    "the law - of - mass action is applicable and leads to the following relation between particle yields @xmath35 \\cdot [ \\rm{y } ] / [ \\rm{k}^- ] \\cdot [ \\rm{n } ] \\ , = \\ , \\kappa$ ] with @xmath36 $ ] being the multiplicity of particle x and @xmath18 the equilibration constant @xcite . at this",
    "low beam energies the hyperons are produced together with k@xmath0 and k@xmath37 in equal rates , hence , @xmath38 = [ \\rm{k}^+ ] + [ \\rm{k}^0 ] \\approx 2 \\cdot [ \\rm{k}^+]$ ] .",
    "the multiplicity of nucleons [ n ] can be related to the average number of participants @xmath29 .",
    "the pion density [ @xmath15 ] contains unequal contributions from [ @xmath40 , [ @xmath41 and [ @xmath42 due to the isospin asymmetry of the colliding system .",
    "the details of the calculation to obtain the equilibration constant @xmath18 from the measured data can be found in @xcite .",
    "the results using the separate fits to the and data are presented in the lower right panel of figure [ fig_ratio ] and they show that @xmath18 is independent of the centrality and of the collision system within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "although the production of k@xmath0 and of k@xmath1 mesons is strongly coupled via the strangeness exchange reaction significant differences between k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 have been found @xcite .",
    "the left hand side of figure [ fig_spec_tmbin ] shows the production cross sections for k@xmath0 and for k@xmath1 mesons measured close to midrapidity as a function of the kinetic energy in the center - of - momentum system for the five centrality bins in au+au collisions at @xmath25  agev .",
    "the uppermost spectra correspond to the most central reactions , the subsequent bins are shown from the top to the bottom of the figure with decreasing centrality . the error bars represent the statistical uncertainties of the kaon and the background events .",
    "an overall systematic error of 10% due to efficiency corrections and beam normalization has to be added .",
    "the solid lines represent the boltzmann function @xmath43 fitted to the data .",
    "@xmath44 is a normalization constant and the exponential function describes the energy distribution with @xmath45 being the inverse slope parameter .    the spectra presented in figure [ fig_spec_tmbin ] exhibit a distinct difference between k@xmath1 and k@xmath0 : the slopes of the k@xmath1 spectra are steeper than those of the k@xmath0 spectra .",
    "the inverse slope parameters @xmath45 as a function of @xmath29 for each centrality bin are displayed in the right hand side of the figure .",
    "@xmath45 increases with increasing centrality and is found to be significantly lower for k@xmath1 than for k@xmath0 , even for the most central collisions .",
    "the same behaviour has been observed for collisions at @xmath46  agev .",
    "another observable showing a distinct difference between k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 is the polar angle emission pattern .",
    "due to limited statistics we considered only au+au collisions at @xmath25  agev grouped into two centrality bins : near - central ( impact parameter @xmath476 fm ) and non - central collisions ( @xmath486 fm ) @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_angdis ] displays the polar angle distribution for k@xmath0 ( upper panels ) and for k@xmath1 ( lower panels ) , both for near - central ( right ) and for non - central collisions ( left ) .",
    "the solid lines represent the function @xmath49 which is fitted to the experimental distributions with the values of @xmath50 given in the figure . in near - central collisions",
    "the k@xmath1 mesons exhibit an isotropic emission pattern whereas the emission of the k@xmath0 mesons is forward - backward peaked .",
    "the angular distributions observed for k@xmath0 and for k@xmath1 in collisions at @xmath46  agev are similar to the ones presented in figure  [ fig_angdis ] @xcite .",
    "the left hand side of figure [ fig_azimuthal ] shows the azimuthal distributions of @xmath52 and k@xmath0 mesons for semi - central collisions at @xmath25  agev , the right hand side the distributions for @xmath52 , k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 in collisions at @xmath46  agev @xcite .",
    "the distributions are corrected for the angular resolution of the reaction plane determination @xcite .",
    "the data are fitted using the first two components of a fourier series @xmath53 resulting in values for @xmath54 and @xmath55 as given in the figures together with the statistical errors .",
    "the determination of the coefficient @xmath54 is subject to an additional systematic error of 0.04 .    in both , @xmath52 and k@xmath0 mesons ,",
    "exhibit a pronounced enhancement at @xmath56 , i.e.  perpendicular to the reaction plane . for @xmath52 mesons",
    "this effect can be interpreted as rescattering and absorption within the spectator fragments .",
    "the study of collisions was performed at a higher incident energy of @xmath46  agev .",
    "the resulting higher production cross section for k@xmath1 mesons provides an opportunity to study both charged kaon species .",
    "the data are shown on the right hand side of figure [ fig_azimuthal ] along with @xmath52 mesons for semi - central collisions .",
    "both , @xmath52 and k@xmath0 mesons follow , the same trend already observed in collisions .",
    "the values for @xmath55 are smaller than in as one might expect for the smaller system .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath52 and to the k@xmath0 mesons the k@xmath1 mesons show an in - plane enhancement .    this `` positive '' ( in - plane ) elliptic flow of particles is observed for the first time in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies .",
    "in contrast to this observation one would expect a preferential out - of - plane emission ( negative elliptic flow ) of k@xmath1 mesons due to their large absorption cross section in spectator matter",
    ".    a depletion of the expected out - of - plane emission pattern of k@xmath1 mesons might be due to the fact that they are produced via strangeness - exchange reactions .",
    "this causes a delay in the freeze - out of the k@xmath1 mesons  @xcite and , hence , a reduced shadowing effect by the spectator fragments which have moved further away . the observed in - plane emission of k@xmath1 mesons , however , can not be easily explained by this scenario .    in order to quantitatively explain the k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 meson azimuthal distributions in figure [ fig_iqmd ] we compare our data to recent results of the iqmd model @xcite .",
    "this transport calculation takes into account both the space - time evolution of the reaction system and the in - medium properties of the strange mesons .",
    "the dashed and solid lines represent results of calculations without and with in - medium potentials , respectively . in the case of the k@xmath0 mesons the effect of the repulsive k@xmath0n potential is small in this model .",
    "a large fraction of the observed out - of - plane enhancement , in contrast to other models @xcite , is caused by the scattering of k@xmath0 mesons .",
    "the transport code ( hsd ) @xcite in contrast predicts a dominant influence of the potential on the emission pattern of the k@xmath0 mesons . in the system au+au at 1  agev where both size and life time of the fireball are larger than in the ni+ni case , the effect of the repulsive k@xmath0n potential was found to be very important @xcite .",
    "the lower part of figure [ fig_iqmd ] shows a comparison of the k@xmath1 data to calculations without ( dashed ) and with ( solid ) k@xmath1n potential .",
    "when neglecting the k@xmath1n potential , the calculation predicts a weak out - of  plane elliptic flow caused by shadowing .",
    "this effect is rather small because of the late emission of k@xmath1 mesons .",
    "when taking into account the attractive in - medium k@xmath1n potential the model is able to describe the experimental in - plane elliptic flow pattern much better .",
    "model calculations with the hsd code @xcite predict a flat azimuthal distribution both with and without a k@xmath1n potential and , hence can not explain the observed in - plane flow of k@xmath1 mesons .",
