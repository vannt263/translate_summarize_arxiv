    "the error boxes of unidentified gamma - ray sources are usually large , and thus the task of finding appropriate candidate counterparts at other wavelengths has not been easy .",
    "about 20 bright point - like gamma - ray sources were found near the galactic plane using cos - b ( swanenburg et al .",
    "1981 ) some of which may be concentrations of molecular hydrogen ( mayer - hasselwander & simpson 1990 ) .",
    "another few , such as the crab and vela pulsars , were identified based on their periodic emission ( thompson et al .",
    "the nature of the other objects remained unknown .    the much more sensitive egret telescope on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _",
    "( _ cgro _ ) was expected to contribute decisively to the identification of the cos - b sources . and indeed , the higher count rates and tighter source locations provided by egret confirmed the existence of most of the cos - b sources and led to the identification of several other sources .",
    "most prominent were the gamma - ray pulsars geminga and psr  b170644 which could be identified on the basis of detections at x - ray and radio wavelengths ( see e.g.  kanbach 2002 and becker & pavlov 2001 for a review and references ) . at high galactic latitudes about 90 new high - energy sources",
    "could be correlated with blazars .",
    "the final egret catalog of gamma - ray sources lists 271 objects ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) of which about 170 are unidentified .",
    "their distribution suggests that most of them are galactic .",
    "the origin and nature of this population of extremely energetic objects is clearly of interest .",
    "seven of the galactic gamma - ray sources are rotation - powered pulsars , identified through the periodic modulation of their gamma - ray fluxes .",
    "these seven are also persistent , point - like sources at gamma - ray energies . in the 100 mev  1 gev energy range , these sources have hard , power - law - like spectra with high - energy cut - offs at a few gev .",
    "although rotation - powered pulsars are best known as radio sources , this is not true for all  geminga , for example , shows at best marginal evidence of pulsed radio emission ( kuzmin & losovkii 1997 ) .",
    "geminga is thus taken as the prototype of a ` radio - quiet ' gamma - ray pulsar of which many more should exist in the galaxy . although geminga s gamma - ray luminosity is rather low ( its small distance of about 160 pc makes it a bright source ) the property of radio faintness could be indicative of pulsar emission where the beamed radiation at different wavelengths is emitted into widely different directions .",
    "such a model may be applicable to young , high luminosity pulsars as well ( yadigaroglu & romani 1995 )",
    ". there are other models to explain geminga s radio faintness though ( e.g.  gil et al .  1998 ) .    a review of the spectra of unidentified low galactic latitude egret sources ( bertsch et al . 2000 ;",
    "merck et al .",
    "1996 ) shows that about 10 objects exhibit the very hard power - law type spectra with a cut - off at several gev as seen also in the identified pulsars .",
    "these objects would be prime targets for identification efforts at other wavelengths .",
    "relatively deep radio searches ( at 770 mhz ) at the positions of several of these sources have not found radio counterparts ( nice & sayer 1997 )",
    ". population studies of the unidentified gamma - ray sources close to the galactic plane indicate that their luminosities are also quite compatible with the luminosities of the younger identified pulsars ( kanbach et al .",
    "suggestions , other than pulsars , for the nature of these gamma - ray sources have also been widely discussed .",
    "energetic objects , like massive young stars or ob associations and snrs have been correlated with the 3eg catalog ( e.g. romero et al .",
    "2000 ) and certainly indicate a close relationship with the gamma - ray sources .",
    "multi - wavelength observations focusing on promising candidate sources have been quite successful in recent years .",
    "observations in x - rays have been useful : e.g.  in the cases of 3eg  j2006@xmath112321 = pmn2005@xmath112310 ( wallace et al .  2002 ) and 3eg j2016 + 3657 = b2013 + 370 ( halpern et al .",
    "new pulsar / isolated neutron star identifications were reported , e.g.  3eg  j2227 + 6122 ( halpern et al .",
    "2001b ) by discovery of the characteristic pulsar period of rx / ax  j2229.0 + 6114 .",
    "x - ray observations were used to relate the high galactic latitude source 3eg  j1835 + 5918 to an isolated neutron star , rx  j1836.2 + 5925 ( reimer et al . 2001 ; mirabal & halpern 2001 ; halpern et al . 2002 ) .    with the wealth of incoming discoveries from the parkes multi - beam pulsar survey ,",
    "promising associations between newly discovered radio pulsars and egret sources have also been discussed .",
    "these associations include the two young pulsars psr  j14206048 and psr  j18370604 ( damico et al .",
    "2001 ) in the vicinity of 3eg  j14206038 and 3eg  j18370606 , respectively ; psr  j10165857 near the snr g284.31.8 is a plausible counterpart for 3eg  j10135915 ( camilo et al .",

    "we do recognize , of course , that the assumption is not accurate far off - axis , however , this is partially compensated in that there is a good deal of conservatism built into the definition of the positional uncertainty and by the fact that there is very little impact on the position centroid .    as a further check on our estimate of the systematic error in the correlation of the x - ray and optical positions a position - error weighted least squares fit was performed .",

    "the fitted quantities for right ascension , declination , and roll angle were @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "considering that we have ignored any possible systematic errors in the non - x - ray positions , such as those due to proper motion , we feel that applying this offset is unjustified .",

    "the spectral data were corrected for the effects of charge transfer inefficiency produced by proton damage to the front - illuminated ccds early in the mission . finally , we accounted for the impacts of molecular contamination on the acis filters with the number of days since launch set at 1275 .",
    "for the absorbing column we used tbabs in xspec ( v.11.2 ) with the default cross sections but with the abundances set to wilms , allen & mccray ( 2000 ) .",
    "the data were binned with no less than 10 counts per spectral bin .",
    "all given errors on spectral parameters are extremes on the two interesting parameters at the 68% confidence range .",
    "as noted previously , spectral analysis were restricted to the energy range @xmath48 kev because of the large uncertainties in the acis spectral response at low energies .",
    "three spectral models were applied .",
    "the first model , an absorbed power law , resulted in a statistically excellent fit ( @xmath37 of 16.7 for 15 degrees of freedom ) but with physically unreasonable parameters such as a very steep power law spectral index of 8.2 .",
    "the second model was the thermal , emission - line xspec model mekal . with @xmath49 ( solar metallicity ) , we obtained an acceptable fit ( @xmath50 for 15 degrees of freedom ) with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 kev .",
    "the 1@xmath30 confidence ranges for the column absorption and temperature are @xmath53 and @xmath54 kev , respectively . the third model , a blackbody with @xmath55 and @xmath56 kev , provides an alternative statistically acceptable representation of the x - ray spectrum ( table  [ t : spectra ] ) .",
    "the spectrum and residuals of that fit are shown in figure  [ f : spectrum_s312_bbody ] .    from the hi in the galaxy ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) we compute the column absorption through the galaxy in the direction to @xmath0-cygni to be @xmath57 .",
    "this is comparable with the column absorption of sources in @xmath0-cygni ( maeda et al .",
    "1999 ; uchiyama et al .",
    "2002 ) and significantly higher than what is found from spectral fits of s312 , suggesting that this source is a foreground object .",
    "the low - column mekal spectrum together with the positional identification would appear to establish s312 ( rx j2020.2 + 4026 ) as the x - ray counterpart to the k0v - star , invalidating its association with the unidentified egret source 3eg j2020 + 4017 .",
    "this conclusion is bolstered by considering the upper limit to the x - ray luminosity of @xmath58 which we obtained from the x - ray flux of @xmath59 and the distance upper limit of @xmath60 pc .",
    "the latter was derived from the star s spectral type k0 ( brazier et al .",
    "1996 ) and distance modulus .",
    "we note that the luminosity is slightly high suggesting the star is rotating `` rapidly '' which is mildly inconsistent with the optical spectra .      as with s312 ( rx j2020.2 + 4026 )",

    "all with fewer than 69 detected source counts , no spectral fitting was attempted .",

    ", the data were separated between back- and front - illuminated ccds , the back - illuminated ccds being somewhat more sensitive to low energy x - rays .",
    "clearly , since most of these sources were detected with a small number of total counts , the uncertainties are large and it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions .",
    "thus the figures are primarily included for completeness .",
    "we note that the hardest sources ( s203 , s302 , s313 , s316 ) , those that occupy the upper - right portions of the diagrams , are among those with no usno and/or 2mass counterparts and these may be background sources ( agn ) absorbed by the galactic column .",
    "the very soft and unabsorbed sources ( s315 , s219 , s403 , s207 , s210 , s217 ) are likely to be associated with foreground stars and all have optical and infrared candidate counterparts . the infrared colors ( table  [ t:2mass_colors ] ) of all of these objects , except for the candidate counterpart to s219 , are those expected for evolved main sequence ( primarily k ) stars .",
    "the counterpart to s219 would have to be a giant or supergiant .",

    "there is also , less compelling , evidence that s219 flared .",

    "a deep search for radio pulsations from 2cg078 + 2 was carried out using the gbt on 2003 december 27 .",

    "( 2002 ) in their detection of 65-ms radio pulsations from the pulsar in snr  3c  58 .",
    "given the uncertain position of the putative pulsar , the observing time was divided into four separate pointings of the 15@xmath71 ( fwhm ) beam : one pointing was approximately centered on rx j2020.3 + 4026 , and the remainder were arranged so as to cover much of the egret error region likely to contain the @xmath0-ray source with 99% probability ( figure  [ radio_pointings ] ) .",
    "due to time constraints , dwell times of 4 hr for three of the pointings , and 3 hr for the fourth , were used .",
    "the pointings are summarized in table  [ radio_pointings_tabel ] .",
    "data were acquired with the berkeley caltech pulsar machine ( bcpm ) , an analog / digital filter bank ( backer et al .",
    "1997 ) that divides the frequency band into 96 contiguous channels and samples the incoming voltages of the two orthogonal circular polarizations received by the telescope every 72 @xmath72s . for these observations ,",
    "the channel bandwidth was set to 0.5 mhz so that a total band of 48 mhz was recorded .",
    "after summing the polarizations , the resulting total - power time samples were written to disk with 4-bit precision for subsequent off - line processing .",
    "known pulsars were successfully detected before and after the 2cg078 + 2 observations .",

    ", 12 ( 10 ) adjacent time samples were added together prior to dedispersion of the 4-hr ( 3-hr ) observations .",
    "the resulting decimated time series had effective sampling times of 864 and 720 @xmath72s .",
    "this choice of decimation was convenient for the periodicity search , which uses a base - two fourier transform algorithm . for a @xmath73-point fourier transform , the effective integration times were 3.9 hr and 3.2 hr .",
    "the latter data were zero padded .",
    "each observation was analyzed separately .",
    "the data were first dedispersed at 301 trial dispersion measure ( dm ) values between 0 and 300 @xmath74 pc .",
    "the expected dm from the ne2001 electron density model ( cordes & lazio 2002 ) for @xmath75 and @xmath76 is @xmath77 @xmath74 pc , assuming a distance of 1.5 kpc ( landecker , roger & higgs 1980 ) .",
    "the maximum dm in this direction is 350 @xmath74 pc ( cordes & lazio 2002 ) .",
    "the resulting time series were then fourier transformed and the amplitude spectra searched for significant features . to increase sensitivity to narrow duty - cycle pulses , individual spectra summing the first 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 harmonics were also searched .",
    "the resulting list of candidate signals above a s / n threshold of 6 were then folded in the time domain for visual inspection .",
    "no convincing pulsar - like signals were found .",
    "based on the known system parameters ( camilo et al .",
    "2002 ) we estimate the sensitivity of our observations to be @xmath78 mjy at periods @xmath79 ms and dms consistent with the 1.5 kpc distance . with a typical duty cycle",
    "@xmath80 , this yields @xmath81jy . for a distance of 1.5 kpc",
    "the 820-mhz luminosity limit @xmath82 is @xmath83 . for an assumed radio spectral index of @xmath84",
    "( see e.g.  lorimer et al .",
    "1995 ) the corresponding luminosity at 1400 mhz is @xmath85 which is lower than most of the recent deep radio search limits ( see e.g.  camilo 2003 ) .",
    "if there is a pulsar operating in 3eg j2020 + 4017 , our sensitivity limit suggests that the pulsar either does not produce significant amounts of radio emission or that its geometry is such that the radio beam does not intersect with the line of sight .",
    "we have searched a portion of the @xmath0-cygni field for possible x - ray counterparts to the intriguing gamma - ray source 3eg j2020 + 4017 ( 2cg078 + 2 ) using _ chandra _ and rosat .",
    "we have shown that a previous candidate , rx j2020.2 + 4026 , is almost certainly not the gamma - ray source but identified with a normal star .",
    "this conclusion is based on the refined position of the x - ray source , its spectrum and coincidence with both optical and infrared sources and the inferred x - ray luminosity .",
    "further , we have found a total of 38 x - ray sources in the _ chandra _ s2- , s3- and s4-fields which covers only part of the much larger error box containing the location of the egret source . a re - analysis of archival rosat hri data revealed three more x - ray sources within the egret error box which are not detected in the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "two of these sources are surely variable whereas the third source was found in a region not covered by the _",
    "chandra _ observation .",
    "we found that some of the _ chandra _ sources have counterparts that may be main - sequence stars based on their identification with optical objects and 2mass sources of normal colors . of course the x - ray emission may not be due to the main sequence star , but can arise from an accreting compact companion .",
    "none of the x - ray sources appear to be radio pulsars , down to a limiting sensitivity of @xmath86 for an assumed pulse duty cycle of 4% .",
    "this limit also applies to the entire region associated with the 99%-confidence position contours of 3eg j2020 + 4017 .",
    "determining an upper limit for a putative x - ray point source located within the 68% confidence contour of 3eg j2020 + 4017 using archival rosat pspc data we found a @xmath64 luminosity upper limit of @xmath87 which is four times smaller than the rosat pspc - deduced luminosity observed from the vela pulsar ( @xmath88 , e.g.  table 3 in becker & aschenbach 2002 ) but about four times higher than the total rosat observed x - ray luminosity from geminga ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "we therefore consider it as a valid option that the counterpart of 3eg j2020 + 4017 is a neutron star with an x - ray luminosity similar to that observed from vela - like to middle - aged pulsars .",
    "an object with such luminosity would not have been detected in the x - ray data from rosat which cover that region of the sky . adopting the snr age of 5400 yrs and assuming a spin - down to x - ray energy conversion factor of @xmath3 ( becker & trmper 1997 ) we are able to constrain the spin - parameters of such a putative neutron star to be @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 g , which are consistent with the properties of known vela- to middle - aged pulsars ( e.g.  gonzalez & safi - harb 2003 , becker & pavlov 2001 ) , given the uncertainty of this approach . the ratio of the @xmath0-ray to soft x - ray flux deduced from our upper limit , @xmath93 , is consistent with this conclusion .    in order to obtain a full census of the x - ray population in the error box of 3eg j2020 + 4017 further observations with _",
    "chandra _ are required .",
    "as the discovery of geminga has taught us , deep follow - up optical observations of new x - ray sources can also lead to the identification of the nature of a high - energy source .",
    "finally , the measurements we expect from the _ glast _ mission ( launch 2007 ) should provide a much improved signal - to - noise ratio and a source location better than @xmath94 for this gamma - ray source .",
    "this will open the possibility to directly search for pulsar periodicities in the gamma - ray data . in case",
    "no pulsar is found , the restricted number of _ chandra _ sources in the _ glast _ error box will then be prime candidates for even deeper searches for counterparts .",
