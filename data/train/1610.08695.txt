    "since the thought - experiment of schrdinger cat states ( scss ) was proposed as an example of macroscopic superposed states in 1935 @xcite , the implementation of this quantum coherence has been investigated in various physical systems .",
    "one of the well - known representations for the scs is the superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases @xcite and the research on this nonclassical state has great potential not only for understanding fundamental quantum physics but also for openning up new avenues for quantum technologies ( e.g. , continuous - variable quantum computing @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite , and quantum communications @xcite ) .",
    "quantum optics has provided an excellent platform for generating both trapped and traveling scss .",
    "for example , the stationary scs has been firstly demonstrated in an optical cavity system interacted with flying atoms @xcite .",
    "we here focus on how to generate the traveling scss , which could be used as a carrier of quantum information ( qi ) from one qi processing unit to the other .",
    "an optical parametric amplifier enables to create nonclassical photons in the setup of quantum optics ( e.g. , a squeezed vacuum state ( svs ) ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , the scheme of subtracting photons has been theoretically proposed to achieve the approximated scss with high fidelity @xcite and been experimentally realized with the moderate size of its amplitude in the optical scss @xcite .",
    "it is known that the scss with a sufficiently large amplitude are utilized for fault - tolerant continuous - variable qi processing @xcite .",
    "because this method brings the very high fidelity to scss at small amplitudes , the amplification of the scss may be required for practical qi processing @xcite .",
    "in addition , the traveling scss are also useful resource states for performing nonlocality tests @xcite and for testing indistinguishability of macroscopic states @xcite .",
    "the rapid development of superconducting circuit technology has shown the potential to provide a new platform for scalable quantum systems .",
    "the scs has been recently built inside a 3d microwave cavity coupled with a specific superconducting qubit and quantum zeno dynamics has been also used for implementing scss @xcite .",
    "a dispersive hamiltonian brings the capability to control cavity states useful for continuous - variable qi processing in a cavity - superconductor architecture , and entangled coherent states have been very recently created inside two cavities jointed with a superconducting qubit @xcite .",
    "in particular , the josephson junction non - linearity has been recently used for realizing the josephson parametric amplifier ( jpa ) @xcite or josephson traveling - wave parametric amplifier ( jtwpa ) to generate traveling nonclassical microwave photons in circuit - quantum electrodynamics ( circuit - qed ) @xcite .",
    "we here do not distinguish between the jpa and jtwpa because both produce a traveling svs even though they are quite different from each other on other characteristics . using a traveling photon resource from jtwpa / jpa , many interesting experiments have performed in circuit - qed beyond conventional experiments in quantum optics @xcite and this technical development allows us to investigate traveling microwave qubits through transmission lines corresponding to a photonic qi processing in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "for example , the most recent experiments have shown the detection schemes of a single microwave photon with excellent detection efficiency @xcite , which will be a key ingredient for traveling - microwave qi processing .",
    "we here propose a scheme of generating the odd scss propagating in a transmission line in circuit - qed",
    ". for its implementation , a jtwpa and a single microwave detector are basically required in superconducting circuits . in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] , a svs @xmath0 is traveling in the 1d transmission line with which the other line is coupled by a microwave beam - splitter ( bs ) .",
    "if the detector of a single microwave photon is located in the other line , the event of the photon measurement reveals the single - photon subtraction from the svs and the output state has very high fidelity compared with the traveling odd scs .",
    "finally , we show that the extension of this idea can be applied for creating traveling generalized entangled cat states , which may be useful for qudit qi processing and microwave logical qubits in quantum error - correction @xcite .",
    "an even / odd schrdinger cat state is presented by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and the coherent state is @xmath3 note that @xmath4 and @xmath5 for bigger @xmath6 . in particular , the odd scs @xmath7 can be reformulated in the superposition of odd photon - number states ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9    it is known that an odd scs can be approximately generated from a svs with a single - photon subtraction and we here assume that the single - photon subtraction operation is ideally represented by the photon annihilation operation @xmath10 .",
    "the svs is given by @xmath11 which contains only even photon - number states ( @xmath12 ; squeezing parameter)@xcite .",
    "if a single photon is subtracted from @xmath13 , the output state ( named single - photon subtracted svs @xmath14 ) is given by @xmath15 which is normalized by the factor @xmath16 .",
    "note that this state only contains odd photon number states .",
    "thus , the fidelity between @xmath14 and @xmath17 @xcite is given by @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] , @xmath19 reaches to an odd schrdinger cat state with the maximum fidelity as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath20 and a high fidelity can be achieved with the condition of @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath23 at @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 at @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 at @xmath30 and @xmath31 as shown in fig .  [ fig:02 ] .",
    "we present a novel scheme for implementation of a traveling schrdinger cat state from a svs produced through the jtwpa .",
    "the proposed scheme has two main parts in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] . the first part before a microwave bs shows how to generate the traveling svs , which has been recently implemented in several world - leading groups @xcite .",
    "the jtwpa is formed in a chain of josephson junctions , capacitors , and inductors and the technique of resonant phase matching is used in a four - wave mixing process either to amplify an input signal or to generate a svs .",
    "the bandwidth of the jtwpa is about some ghz and the four - wave mixing process brings the squeezing of the output microwave at the end of the jtwpa .",
    "thus , the squeezed state from the jtwpa might be used as an important resource of traveling microwave states for qi processing in circuit - qed .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] , the protocol is as follows .",
    "1 ) a svs @xmath32 is generated by the jtwpa in mode @xmath33 .",
    "2 ) @xmath13 passes through a transmission line and a microwave bs makes a coupling with transmission @xmath34 between the transmission line and an additional line @xmath35 .",
    "3 ) at the end of the line @xmath35 , a superconducting qubit is located to detect a single - photon microwave in a cavity .",
    "4 ) if the detector clicks , a single - photon subtracted svs is heralded in mode @xmath33 and a quadrature measurement is performed to verify the odd scss .      in the second step of the protocol",
    ", the action of the bs with transmission @xmath34 is described by the operator @xcite @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general , the transmission rate @xmath38 in a mirowave bs is controlled by the common length of two transmission lines and a relatively short length is required for @xmath39 .",
    "a single - photon detector is of essence for photonic qi processing and has been very recently demonstrated in experimental circuit - qed @xcite . because the energy of microwaves is in general some orders of amplitude weaker than optical photons and their wavelength are about the order of a chip size ( milimeters to centimeters ) , it is very challenging for the detection of propagating microwave photons but a technical breakthrough has been developed to build a single microwave detector with a high efficiency and a low dark - count probability . in ref .",
    "@xcite , four levels of a flux qubit are driven to be in dressed states to absorb a microwave photon in a half - wavelength resonator .",
    "then , the readout of the qubit excited state is performed in a parametric phase - locked oscillator with detection efficiency above 0.6 .    at the final part in figure [ fig:01 ] , if a single photon is detected in mode @xmath35 , the outcome state in mode @xmath33 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "note that @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be decomposed into three terms , which are transformed to its normalization factor , @xmath45 , and @xmath10 ( see detail calculations in @xcite ) .",
    "it shows that the projection to a single - photon state from a vacuum in mode @xmath35 has the consequence of subtracting a photon with a bs from the other state in mode @xmath33 but to leave only the operator @xmath10 .",
    "the fidelity @xmath46 between @xmath47 and @xmath48 is given by @xmath49.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure [ fig:03 ] implies that the scs @xmath50 can be always found with the same fidelity @xmath46 along the contour line and that the appropriate parameter @xmath12 is fixed at a specific transmission rate @xmath34 to acquire the maximum @xmath46 .",
    "for example , if a big squeezed vacuum is given with @xmath51 , its photon distribution in fock states is very flat and @xmath52 is approximately @xmath53 due to @xmath54 .",
    "thus , a bs with @xmath55 always gives us lower fidelity to the odd cat distribution while a bs with @xmath56 only does an opportunity to obtain good fidelity as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] .",
    "finally , homodyne ( or heterodyne ) measurement is a well established scheme for gaining the quadrature distribution in quantum optics . the quantum state tomography from this measurement scheme has been successfully performed in circuit - qed by a jpa squeezing method @xcite .",
    "for example , an ordinary microwave amplifier ( like a high - electron - mobility transistor ) amplifies the input signal with large noise and the output states are too much blurred ( or noisy ) for quadrature detection .",
    "however , jpa can amplify the signal well enough with a phase - sensitive method .",
    "in particular , the output signal through jpa can clearly provide improvement of homodyne measurement to perform quantum tomography and even a realistic model with loss / noise conditions is demonstrated with an extra bs as an imperfect homodyne measurement in circuit - qed @xcite .",
    "we here propose a new scheme for building generalized entangled coherent states ( ecss ) as a traveling entangled state in a representation of several coherent states in microwaves .",
    "the ecss have been investigated for applications of qi processing @xcite and the implementation schemes have been developed in quantum optics and circuit - qed @xcite .",
    "an optical svs is treated as an input even scs in quantum optics and two svss are mixed with a bs to build a qubit ecs while the ecs in circuit - qed is trapped inside two microwave cavities . however , our target state is a more generalized ecs ( named qudit ecs ) and this qudit - type states are demonstrated and very useful for encoding quantum error - correcting codes under photon - loss @xcite .    the qudit ecs @xmath57 is defined as the entangled state with multiple coherent states .",
    "for example , for @xmath58 , @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for coefficient @xmath64 @xcite . based on the above scheme of generating odd scss , it is assumed that each single photon - subtraction operation is implemented in modes @xmath33 and @xmath65 and @xmath66 is approximately equal to @xmath67 in mode @xmath65 because @xmath68 makes positive numbers in the terms of the power @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ sq_v01 ] ) .",
    "once the single - photon detection occurs from the input svss simultaneously , the output state after a typical bs with @xmath70 is very close to the qudit ecs such as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 upto linear phase operations",
    ".    from the qudit ecs @xmath74 , a microwave detection in mode @xmath33 ( or @xmath65 ) possibly generates a superposition of four coherent states which could be a carrier of error - correctable logical qubits against photon losses @xcite .",
    "however , because the amplitude of these coherent states are not large enough for fault - tolerant qi processing , one may need to perform the amplification schemes of traveling coherent states ( or scss ) to maintain the orthogonality among the coherent states @xcite .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:04 ] , the final output starting from two svss is explicitly given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , @xmath77 due to @xmath78 .",
    "for example , if a two - photon state @xmath79 is measured in @xmath80 , the outcome is given by @xmath81 .",
    "on the other hand , we can obtain @xmath82 with detection of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "thus , a traveling logical qubit can be built in the superposition of only even - photon states and is error correctable by parity measurements @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the state @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ sec4 - 04 ] ) is also known as a robust quantum resource for quantum sensing against photon losses @xcite .",
    "the n00n state , given by @xmath85 for photon number @xmath86 , provides the heisenberg limit for quantum phase metrology but is fragile against photon losses while @xmath84 still keep the phase information in the presence of channel losses .",
    "for example , if photon losses occur in mode @xmath65 , the n00n state loses the superposition of two - mode states and becomes a mixed state only in mode @xmath65 without phase information while other resilient states ( like @xmath80 and @xmath74 ) can be two - mode mixed states with many fock - state components , which contain imprinted phase information @xcite .",
    "in summary , we propose an implementation scheme of traveling scss and qudit ecs in circuit - qed .",
    "a single - photon subtraction method is currently feasible using newly developed microwave - photon detectors and a nonclassical state ( i.e. , svs ) is manifested as an input resource state to generate approximated scss .",
    "the fidelity of the output states with the target odd scss reaches to above 0.95 for @xmath87 theoretically . furthermore",
    ", if one can perform the scheme of the odd scs twice simultaneously , a traveling qudit ecs could be feasible .",
    "a few obstacles still remain for demonstrating our scheme in the state - of - the - art techniques of circuit - qed .",
    "the amount of losses are currently inevitable in traveling microwaves along transmission lines .",
    "the current schemes of a single - microwave detector include a few circulators in which microwave photons suffer losses , so our setup might be built in a single superconductor chip without a circulator .",
    "the single microwave detectors in @xcite are equivalent to on - off detectors and only can be used for our scheme with @xmath55 due to maintaining a very low average photon number in the detection line .",
    "this causes a low success probability to generate the odd scs .",
    "thus , the improvement of the single - photon detector will provide higher success probability for the scheme .",
