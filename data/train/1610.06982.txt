    "polarization of light was initially defined with the help of stokes parameters @xcite @xmath1 . the point having coordinates @xmath2 lies on a sphere of radius @xmath3 called poincare sphere represented by @xmath4 for unpolarized light @xmath5 and for partially polarized light @xmath6 .",
    "stokes parameters involve coherence functions@xcite of order ( 1,1 ) and it has been realized that these are insufficient to describe polarization completely as @xmath7 does not represent only unpolarized light.@xcite these parameters are still relevant because of the non - classicalities associated with polarization , _ viz _ , the polarization squeezing and polarization entanglement.@xcite + appropriate continuous variables for non - classical polarization states are stokes operators@xcite which have a clear analogy with the stokes parameters .",
    "these operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 have a similarity with spin variables of atomic systems and are given by @xmath10 simultaneous exact measurement of these variables is impossible as they follow the uncertainty relations to limit their variances written as @xmath11 which can be obtained by using the commutation relations @xmath12=0,~[\\hat s_j , \\hat s_k]=2i{\\sum_{l}\\epsilon_{jkl}}~\\hat s_{l}.\\ ] ] @xmath13 being levi - civita symbol for @xmath14 or @xmath15 as annihilation and creation operators follow the commutation relations @xmath16=\\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "+ similar to the concept of ordinary squeezing , polarization squeezing is defined using the commutation relations followed by stokes operators and uncertainty products .",
    "polarization squeezing having applications in quantum information theory , it is desirable to devise methods for generation of states with appreciable polarization squeezing .",
    "+ in this paper , we investigate the polarization squeezing using the most general criterion for it , in the coherent light under a squeezing operation such as degenerate parametric amplification with a nonlinear interaction hamiltonian and report the closed form result .",
    "the incident coherent beam shows high polarization squeezing after nonlinear interaction and the degree of polarization squeezing can be less than unity by a very small amount for certain photon intensity and phases in two polarization modes .",
    "it is important to note that in most cases of realizations of polarization squeezing the beam intensity has been very large in order to efficiently realize a quadrature measurement .",
    "however , in this study we get a tighter bound on beam intensity with some additional conditions .",
    "polarization squeezing was first defined by chirkin et al.@xcite as @xmath17 , _",

    "+ luis and korolkova@xcite finally compared various criteria and gave the following criterion for polarization squeezing of a component of @xmath20 along a unit vector @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is component of @xmath20 along unit vector @xmath24 which is perpendicular to @xmath25 .",
    "for suitable orthogonal components @xmath26 and @xmath23 , they have discussed the order of stringency of the various criteria as @xmath27    the authors finally have written the criterion for polarization squeezing in the form @xcite @xmath28 arguing that there are infinite directions @xmath29 for a given component @xmath26 and therefore it is needed to consider maximum possible value of @xmath30 .",

    "consider a beam of two mode coherent radiation and we pass it through a squeezing operation like degenerate parametric amplification that changes @xmath38 mode after the nonlinear interaction .",
    "hamiltonian in the interaction picture@xcite for this kind of a squeezing operation can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 are annihilation operators for the two linear polarizations @xmath38 and @xmath41 .",
    "the state at time @xmath42 after this nonlinear interaction is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 being a coupling constant .",
    "+ if , the incident light in the coherent state @xmath46 with @xmath47 , straight forward calculations give the expectation values and variances of stokes operators after the interaction time @xmath48 as @xmath49 and @xmath50    in order to study the maximum polarization squeezing , we perform extensive numerics for the minimization of squeezing factors obtained by plugging in the values for all three stokes operators @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 using the criterion mentioned in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "this minimization was done for fixed number of photons in both the polarization modes and we observe that with the forms of polarization squeezing factors obtained for set of values @xmath54 corresponding to maximum polarization squeezing in @xmath51 and @xmath53 , it is challenging to perform analytical calculations .",
    "+ however , we find that @xmath55 attains its minimum at @xmath56 and @xmath57 making it analytically feasible to find the conditions on photon intensity and time for maximum polarization squeezing to occur , though it is difficult to show that these are the only minima .",
    "the polarization squeezing factor and degree of polarization squeezing for stokes operator @xmath58 has the form @xmath59 for these set of values @xmath54 , the expression for @xmath55 can be written as @xmath60 or @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "polarization squeezing , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath63 is not likely to occur when @xmath64 as @xmath65 can not take negative values . for polarization squeezing , therefore , we look for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "it shows that @xmath91 .",
    "it can also be seen that @xmath92 as @xmath93 is positive for @xmath94 and its derivative with @xmath95 , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath96 .",
    "we can similarly show that @xmath97 and thus we have @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath99 , @xmath100 in the interval @xmath101 in which polarization squeezing occurs in the interval @xmath102 . for @xmath82",
    ", however , @xmath103 and hence @xmath66 in the interval @xmath84 in which polarization squeezing occurs in the interval @xmath102 .",
    "this becomes clear if we write @xmath104 if @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the values of @xmath38 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively , the expression for polarization squeezing factor can be written as @xmath109 minimization of this expression with respect to @xmath38 by derivative method for a positive root of equation @xmath110 gives the minimum value of polarization squeezing factor corresponding to maximum polarization squeezing as @xmath111 at time @xmath112.\\ ] ] @xmath55 is less than 1 for @xmath90 .",
    "we thus note that for polarization squeezing to occur one shall have two conditions @xmath90 and @xmath113 .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath126 and @xmath94 .",
    "it is observed that in order to achieve maximum polarization squeezing the intensity of light should be tending to zero in the parametrically amplified mode and maximum in the counter - mode .",
    "we found the maximum polarization squeezing is feasible to be analytically calculated in the stokes parameter @xmath127 by minimization of polarization squeezing factor @xmath128 .",
    "it is shown that degree of polarization squeezing is maximum for some definite combinations of @xmath129 and @xmath130 , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath131 and other values .",
    "however , it is not possible to show analytically that these are the only maxima . in this particular case",
    ", we see analytically that polarization squeezing may occur only if the denominator @xmath70 in the expression for polarization squeezing factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) holds a negative value .",

    "it should be noted that this condition on beam intensity allows to achieve polarization squeezing even for a low beam intensity .",

    "( [ eq16 ] ) , in all the three possible cases for photon intensities in two polarization modes .",
    "some examples of photon number values are studied and the plot shows that the maximum polarization squeezing is achieved for equal intensity of light in both the modes .",
    "this plot also presents the pattern for occurrence of polarization squeezing on time axis .    the contour plot for @xmath135 from eq .",

    "[ f3 ] clearly shows that @xmath137 for @xmath138 which is consistent with the essential condition @xmath90 for polarization squeezing .",
    "efficient polarization squeezing shown to be a resource for quantum communication , achieving good extent of polarization squeezing in coherent light via a nonlinear interaction is important .",
    "this work gives an added advantage of low beam intensity in order to observe polarization squeezing in such a system for significant interaction times under some specific conditions .",
