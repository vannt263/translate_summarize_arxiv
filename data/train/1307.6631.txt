    "quantum degenerate ultracold atomic sources have been used to study fundamental processes such as quantum phase transitions @xcite , quantum non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite and entanglement of massive particles @xcite .",
    "their ability to be highly isolated from their environment and controlled precisely by optical , magnetic and rf fields makes them an ideal platform for engineering and manipulating non - trivial quantum states . in quantum optics ,",
    "the most common way to produce entangled states has been through squeezing , and it has been recognised that the intrinsic nonlinearities of atoms naturally lead to quadrature squeezing @xcite .",
    "number squeezing can be achieved with spin squeezing techniques @xcite , molecular dissociation of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , four - wave mixing @xcite , double - well potentials @xcite , or mixing quadrature - squeezed states using ramsey interferometry @xcite .",
    "the creation of these non - classical atomic states has relevance for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics such as the epr paradox @xcite , as well as atom interferometry @xcite .",
    "while these techniques have resulted in significant experimentally detectable number squeezing , they have been limited to small numbers of atoms , typically a few hundred @xcite .",
    "ultracold atomic interferometers are also reaching state of the art sensitivities in precision measurements @xcite .",
    "while all current atom interferometry is limited by technical noise sources , it appears that bec - based coherent sources offer the best chance of overcoming some of these issues , for the same reasons that optical lasers are typically preferred for optical interferometry . in particular",
    ", it appears that bose - condensed sources allow for higher fidelity mirrors and beamsplitters @xcite , are less sensitive to the effects of distortions in the optical wavefronts of the beamsplitters and mirrors and the coriolis effect @xcite , and are robust to the adverse effects of strong outcoupling when feedback - cooled @xcite .",
    "if these technical noise sources can be reduced and/or controlled , atom interferometers will be limited by atomic shot noise , which leads to a sensitivity that scales as the square root of the atomic flux . from that point ,",
    "sensitivity will only be improved by increasing the atomic flux and brightness @xcite , and/or using non - classical quantum states such as squeezed states to go below the shot noise limit @xcite .",
    "producing squeezed states for metrological purposes is therefore only relevant when it can be achieved in a context of large numbers of atoms .",
    "this paper examines the generation of atomic squeezing using the inherent kerr - like nonlinearities of ultracold atoms , and demonstrates a trap geometry in which metrologically relevant levels of squeezing are present in trap geometries that are compatible with large atomic number .",
    "the creation , detection and application of squeezing requires precise mode - matching , and is therefore very sensitive to uncontrolled coupling between spatial modes of the atomic field .",
    "atomic squeezing experiments have typically attempted to operate in the single - mode regime , where the trap is tight enough such that all higher modes are frozen out @xcite . however , tight traps limit the total number of atoms , as the 3-body recombination rate places an effective maximum atomic density in the gas , and well before that limit , the interatomic interactions break the single - mode operation .",
    "both of these effects limit the number of atoms that can be squeezed effectively , so we will examine a broader range of trap geometries , and calculate the dynamics in the presence of multiple spatial modes .",
    "many similar previous simulations have been performed in one or two spatial dimensions , by integrating out some of the remaining dimensions @xcite . for simulations of semiclassical fields",
    "this can be a reasonable approximation , but it can ignore spontaneous scattering processes in full quantum field theory calculations , so we take care to include full 3d simulations .    in section [ sectwomodeanalytic ] we examine the ideal behaviour of a nonlinear bosonic two - state system when that system possesses only a single spatial mode , extracting full analytic solutions for the number squeezing in each of the two states , as well as the number difference squeezing between the two states .",
    "these solutions of the ideal case provide a check on the multimode cases we consider later in the paper , as well as providing a bound on the best possible squeezing for the system . in section [ sec : mmdescription ]",
    "we show how multimode behaviour becomes important in physical systems , and introduce our model for simulating higher dimensional trap geometries .",
    "section  [ sec:1dsim ] analyses one - dimensional models , highlighting some of the issues regarding optimising squeezing parameters and mode - matching in squeezing experiments .",
    "section  [ sec : pipulse ] shows that the application of a @xmath0-pulse during the process can significantly improve mode - matching issues .",
    "section  [ sec:2d3dsqueezing ] investigates measurable squeezing in 2d and 3d , and uses a bogoliubov analysis to explain the scaling with system size and dimensionality .",
    "section  [ sectionconclusion ] describes the conclusion that large volume , flat - bottomed , three - dimensional traps , which are obviously compatible with large atom number , can produce extremely high degrees of squeezing .",
    "our goal is to describe the number squeezing possibilities of a bec comprising two relevant internal states denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian for a pair of coupled atomic internal modes is the spatial integral of the hamiltonian density : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the annihilation field operator for a particle at position @xmath5 and in internal state @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the mass of the atoms , @xmath8 is the trapping potential for atoms in internal state @xmath6 , @xmath9 describes the coupling between the two states , and the @xmath10 describe the various inter- and intra - state nonlinearities and are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the inter- and intra - species s - wave scattering lengths .",
    "we begin by considering a simplified version of the problem , assuming that only one of these spatial modes is relevant for each of the condensate s components .",
    "this is done by writing the multimode atomic field operators in terms of a set of basis functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 annihilate a particle with normalised spatial mode @xmath17 and internal state @xmath1 or @xmath2 respectively . with this expansion ,",
    "the nonlinear term in the multimode hamiltonian for the self - interaction of the @xmath1 internal state becomes @xmath18 when the system remains predominantly in spatial mode @xmath19 , we can approximate this sum as the single term @xmath20 where @xmath21 we proceed similarly for the other terms . in the parameter regimes we are interested in , the detuning between the two spatial modes will be irrelevant , so setting our zero of energy appropriately , we are left with only a standard kerr - type nonlinearity arising from atom - atom interactions , as well as a linear coupling between the two modes .",
    "the hamiltonian governing this reduced system is given by @xmath22 where the @xmath23 describe the various inter- and intra - mode nonlinearities , and @xmath24 couples the two modes and allows for population transfer between them .    when considering squeezing , the hamiltonian ( [ eqtwomodehamiltonian ] ) has typically been handled within the framework of spin squeezing , which has a long history @xcite .",
    "this approach involves exploiting the equivalence between the algebra of two harmonic oscillators and that of angular momentum , and writing @xmath25 using these variables eq .",
    "( [ eqtwomodehamiltonian ] ) becomes @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total number operator , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "for initial states which are total number fock states , the last two terms are physically meaningless phase shifts and the first term can be removed by an appropriate choice of detuning . in this case eq .",
    "reduces to the josephson hamiltonian with zero detuning @xcite @xmath30 the system described by @xmath31 is then solved using angular momentum algebra .",
    "the reduction of eq .   to the josephson hamiltonian has led to the common misconception that no squeezing can be generated in this system if @xmath32 as the effects of the @xmath33 term are usually dismissed as an irrelevant detuning .",
    "this is not true in general for initial states other than a total number fock state as the @xmath34 term leads to a number - dependent detuning .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that for the case of an initial coherent state this term leads to squeezing .",
    "a spin - echo pulse applied half - way through the experiment which exchanges the population of modes @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( which is the protocol used in most spin squeezing experiments ) also cancels the effects of this term , and in this case squeezing is only generated if @xmath37 . in this work",
    "we directly solve eq .",
    "demonstrating that squeezing is generated ( in the absence of a spin - echo pulse ) even if @xmath38 .",
    "the system is prepared with all the population initially in @xmath1 , and vacuum in @xmath2 .",
    "we choose the initial state @xmath1 to be a coherent state with average number @xmath39 . as the system is insensitive to the initial phase of the coherent state ,",
    "this is equivalent to a mixture of coherent states of uncertain phase , or a mixture of poisson - distributed number states .",
    "such a state is consistent with bec coherence experiments @xcite .    at time @xmath40 , the coupling @xmath24 is applied until time @xmath41 , resulting in a portion of the population being transferred into mode @xmath2 .",
    "we assume this transfer process is fast relative to the nonlinear energy time scale , ensuring that , as the initial states were coherent states , after the population transfer both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are still described by coherent states with mean number @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the coupling @xmath24 is then switched off until time @xmath44 , while the atoms interact solely through the nonlinear terms .",
    "after this hold time @xmath45 , the coupling @xmath24 is switched back on until time @xmath46 , with a phase shift @xmath47 compared to its first application . during this last stage ,",
    "the two modes exchange population and the quadrature variances are converted into number variance , in the same way that homodyne measurements are used in quantum optics to convert quadrature squeezing into number squeezing , which can be directly measured . in this interpretation",
    ", @xmath47 is the relative phase of the strong local oscillator , which allows specific phase angles of the quadrature squeezing to be examined .",

    "the local phase evolution of the atomic field is density dependent .",
    "consequently the mode shape of the atomic field changes depending on the nonlinearity - density product , which means that unless @xmath70 for all @xmath71 , the mode shapes will not overlap perfectly during the final coupling pulse .",

    "we might speculate that the effects of these first two problems would be lessened by trap geometries that lead to near - constant density profiles for the bec .",

    "we can not make strong conclusions without also considering the effects of coupling between spatial modes , however , which leads to the third potential problem : coupling between modes is inevitable in the presence of a nonlinearity , meaning that the modes can not be analysed independently .",

    "the only tractable phase space representation is the functional wigner representation @xcite , which is well behaved when the quantum field is approximately gaussian , as it is for coherent and squeezed states .",
    "stochastic methods based on the functional wigner representation have been used to model the behaviour of becs and atom lasers @xcite , as the wigner representation allows the mapping of the system to a fokker - planck equation with positive semi - definite diffusion matrix ( unlike the @xmath72-representation @xcite ) , and does not suffer exponential path - weighting problems that would constrain it to very short simulation intervals ( as would the positive-@xmath72 representation @xcite ) .",

    "( [ eqfieldhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "this defines the evolution of the functional wigner distribution of the system , which has a one - to - one correspondence with the density matrix .",
    "the equation of motion for the functional wigner distribution contains derivatives of third order which we assume to be negligible .",
    "this uncontrolled approximation is called the truncated wigner approximation ( twa ) , and while it has been used widely on ultracold gases @xcite , care must be taken that the simulation remains valid .",
    "for our simulations we checked the results of our simulations against the analytic two - mode solution , as well as checking for typical indications of twa breakdown such as the appearance of negative densities in lightly populated modes .",
    "we were also able to use the bogoliubov analysis described in section [ sec:2d3dsqueezing ] as an independent estimate of the validity of the twa .",
    "we found that the twa remained valid except in some 3d simulations with high nonlinearities , where there were a large number of modes , and the number of particles per mode could drop to ten or less in the densest regions where the squeezing was generated .",
    "over very long time scales , this low mode occupation began to result in twa breakdown .",
    "fortunately , the best squeezing was typically found in regions where the twa was valid .    under the twa ,",
    "the equation of motion for the functional wigner distribution is a fokker - planck equation , and can therefore be sampled by a set of stochastic equations , as described in @xcite .",

    ", suppose the atoms were in a gaussian atomic distribution , but we consider a mode that only includes the atoms within @xmath90 standard deviations of the centre . for low @xmath90 , this mode shape is considerably closer to the constant density case than a standard gaussian .",

    "it is worth noting that despite their difficulty , in multimode systems with large atom number , full 3d simulations need to be carried out to accurately determine the presence of number or spin squeezing .    excluding these modes by making them energetically unfavourable can reduce the system to a single mode problem , making our analytic solution valid , but requires extremely tight trapping potentials .",
