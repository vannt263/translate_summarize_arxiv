    "an impurity with a strong spin - orbit interaction scatters spin up and down electrons with opposite left - right asymmetry . the asymmetric scattering of conduction electrons by spin - orbit scatterers was already investigated by ballentine and huberman @xcite , @xcite almost 30 years ago .",
    "they explained the deviations of the hall constant from the free electron values for heavy liquid metals such as tl , pb and bi . they calculated the spin - orbit scattering using perturbation theory .",

    "the opposite left - right asymmetry of spin up and down scattering by spin - orbit interaction yields two related effect in zero magnetic field :    * in the presence of a spin current sos yields an anomalous hall effect .",
    "a spin current through a conductor with spin - orbit scattering yields a net transverse scattering and therefore a net transverse electric field .",
    "the spin up and down electrons in a spin current have opposite ( drift- ) velocities and therefore a spin - orbit scatterer deflects both spins to the same side .",
    "this generates an anomalous hall effect , i.e. , spin hall effect with a transverse electric field . * for a pure charge current the spin up and down electrons are scattered to opposite sides of the original trajectory .",
    "the sos does not generate a charge imbalance .",
    "however , it creates opposite gradients in the chemical potential for spin up and down electrons .",
    "this effect has been predicted by dyakonov and perel @xcite and hirsch @xcite .",

    "the effect of the au condensation is very small and for larger @xmath1 the ahc actually decreases . from fig.2",

    "this reduction is equivalent to the conductance of about @xmath58 to @xmath59 of cs .",
    "this agrees well with a rather surprizing observation that we made in a previous investigation .",
    "there we condensed pb and au onto an fecs double layer .",
    "the pb and au introduced an additional ahc , but the dependence of the @xmath47 on the coverage of the surface impurities was quite unexpected . for a coverage of @xmath60 or @xmath61 of about 0.03",
    "atomic layer @xmath47 showed a large extremum , and at a coverage of 0.2 atomic layer @xmath47 had almost completely disappeared .",
    "our interpretation of this behavior was that impurities at the surface introduced so much disorder close to the surface that ( i ) most of the spin current decayed before  it reached the pb ( au ) impurities at the surface and ( ii ) the spin - orbit scattered electrons could not generate much current in y - direction because their mfp was so short .",
    "our new experimental data in fig.5 or fig.6 demonstrate that this reduction of the mfp is so dominant that after each au evaporation @xmath51 reduces .",
    "the new au impurities do not generate any significant additional ahc , and the ahc of the lower au layer is reduced because of the mfp reduction .",
    "this reduction of the mfp in the last cs layer can be ( i ) a reduction in the whole last cs layer by a factor of two or ( ii ) a reduction to zero in the upper @xmath58 of cs .",

    "it is compared with the ahe of fe(csag)@xmath0 multi - layers .",
    "although the two kinds of impurities cause almost identical normal scattering and the mfps in the resulting multi - layers are essentially the same , the ahe is quite different .",
    "the difference in the ah conductance @xmath47 is due to a spin current which experiences the spin - orbit scattering of the au impurities .",
    "this effect has been baptized `` spin hall effect '' .",
    "the spin current is due to the different specular reflection of spin up and down electrons at the fecs interface . by condensing a series of csau layers",
    "the size of the spin current can be analyzed geometrically .",

    "each time the longitudinal conductance @xmath20 is reduced by @xmath64this @xmath65 corresponds to the conductance of about @xmath58 of cs .",
    "it is suggested that this is a ( precursor of ) surface localization of the conduction electrons in the cs .",
    "such an effect has recently been observed in the superconducting proximity effect of pbk double layers @xcite .",
    "the pure but very disordered fe film in the fe(csag)@xmath0 multi - layer has an ah conductance of about @xmath41 . when fe is covered with the csag film the ah conductance increases with the coverage ( as is shown in fig.5 ) .",
    "this is due to the following facts @xcite",
    ", @xcite :    \\(i ) if the electric field in the fe points in the x - direction then the current has a finite y - component ( which represents the ah conductance of the fe film @xmath66fe@xmath67 ) .",
    "a fraction of the conduction electrons cross the interface to the cs and carry with them their y - component of the current .",
    "this current in y - direction yields an additional contribution the hall conductance @xmath68 .",
    "this induced ah conductance increases with the cs thickness .",
    "it saturates when the cs thickness reaches about half the mean free path in the cs .",
    "\\(ii ) the second contribution is caused by the electrons which are accelerated in the cs .",
    "when those electrons cross into the fe they have a much larger drift velocity than the native fe electrons .",
    "they therefore yield a strongly enhanced ah conductance within a thin layer of the fe .",
    "this layer has a thickness of about half the mean free path of the fe electrons .",
    "both contributions are of the same order of magnitude and contribute to the increase in the ah conductance of the fe(csag)@xmath0 multi - layer .",
    "the role of the ag impurities lies in the limitation of the mean free path to about @xmath69 .",
    "therefore the increase of the ah conductance levels out at about @xmath14 .",
    "this mechanism of the induced ahe depends on ahe in the fe layer and the mean free paths in the fe and the cs .",
    "we can imagine two different origins of the spin current in the cs film , ( i ) transfer of the spin current in the ferro magnetic fe film through the fecs interface and ( ii ) different specular reflection of the spin up and down electrons in the cs at the fecs interface .",
    "the experimental data favor the second mechanism as the following discussion shows .",
    "\\(i ) the spin up and down electrons in the fe have different densities and mfp s",
    ". therefore the spin up and down current densities in the fe are different .",
    "this represents a spin current which could cross the fecs interface and enter the cs film .",
    "the resulting spin current density @xmath70 at the upper cs surface should be at best independent of the cs thickness",
    ". any scattering within the cs should reduce @xmath70 at the free cs surface .",
    "experimentally we observe , however , a larger ah conductance for the first au coverage when the cs thickness is larger . in a previous experiment we covered a fecs double layer ( @xmath71 ) with 0.02 atomic layer of au and observed @xmath72 @xmath73 . in the present experiment we covered the fecs double layer ( @xmath74 ) with 0.04 atomic layer of au and observed @xmath75 . although the au coverages are not identical it is obvious that the larger cs thickness yields a large spin current density at the free surface .",
    "( ii ) the spin up and down electrons in the cs experience a different degree of specular reflection at the fecs interface .",
    "these electrons have accumulated a finite drift velocity before they are reflected .",
    "this drift velocity increases with larger cs thickness because the effective mfp increases .",
    "the resulting spin current after the reflection is proportional to the current before the reflection .",
    "therefore the spin current density at the free surface increases with increasing cs thickness .",
    "this is the experimental observation .",
    "let us first consider a spin current in a non - magnetic metal film with a constant spin current density @xmath70 .",
    "the metal contains normal and spin - orbit scattering impurities .",
    "the total relaxation time @xmath76 is the same for spin up and down electrons .",
    "in addition the sos impurities scatter spin up and down electrons to the opposite film edges .",

    "the specular part of the reflected electrons maintains the accummulated drift velocity and contributes a current density @xmath109 @xmath110 at @xmath111 .",
    "when @xmath112 then the interface generates a spin current @xmath113 which moves away from the interface into the cs and is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "from now on the electric field has no effect on the size of the spin current .    the electrons ( of the spin current ) with @xmath106 move with an average velocity @xmath116 away from the interface into the cs .",
    "here @xmath117 is the fermi velocity and @xmath118 is of the order of @xmath119 within the cs film both electron spins experience the same relaxation time @xmath76 .",
    "therefore @xmath76 is the decay time for both the charge current and the spin current , for example @xmath120 . in the stationary situation",

    "@xmath121 which yields @xmath122 if there is a finite specular reflection @xmath123 at the upper surface then part of the spin current @xmath113 is reflected at the upper surface .",
    "this results in a spin current which propagates in the negative z - direction and has the form @xmath124    in the following we neglect the specular reflection at the upper surface and we treat the charge current density as constant in the film .",
    "then the polarization @xmath125 of the current density is position dependent.@xmath126          our group recently investigated the effect of surface impurities on the conductance of alkali films using the superconducting proximity effect @xcite .",
    "in these experiments it was demonstrated that the conductance of a @xmath2 thick k film on top of a pb film lost its conductance when covered with a sub - mono layer of pb .",
    "but it maintained its full ability to reduce the superconducting transition temperature of the pb film .",
    "as discussed in @xcite this is the behavior of localized electrons in the k whose localization length is larger than the film thickness",
