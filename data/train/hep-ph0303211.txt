    "the striking phenomenon of geometric scaling discovered in the hera data @xcite has triggered a wide interest .",
    "the inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) cross section @xmath0 measured as a function of the photon virtuality @xmath1 and the bjorken variable @xmath2 , was shown to depend on the single combined variable @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "empirically , this scaling turns out to be valid for @xmath6 and for all available values of @xmath7 ( in practice , for @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) .",
    "geometric scaling has also been found more recently in deep - inelastic scattering off nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a similar scaling behaviour was discussed a long time ago in the framework of elastic proton - proton scattering @xcite . at that time , an impact parameter analysis revealed that the rise of the cross section as a power of the center - of - mass energy was due to an effective growth of the size of the interaction region , which was almost black in its center .",
    "geometric scaling in @xmath10 scattering was discovered in the context of the discussion of saturation effects , and is often considered as an evidence for the fact that the proton looks already quite black , or `` saturated '' , at hera .",
    "the scaling variable turns out to be the dimensionless ratio of the photon virtuality @xmath1 and the so - called saturation scale , which has the following dependence upon the bjorken variable : @xmath11 the latter is believed to characterize the mean transverse momentum of partons with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath2 .",
    "the growth of this typical momentum scale with energy @xmath12 is understood within several different formulations of dense parton evolution @xcite which technically lead to non - linear integro - differential equations .",
    "geometric scaling was seen in numerical simulations of these models @xcite .",
    "it was shown to be consistent with qcd evolution in the range in which it is verified in the data @xcite . in ref.@xcite , it was derived from perturbative qcd for @xmath1 above the saturation scale as a feature of the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite with appropriate boundary conditions . in ref.@xcite , the symmetry of the quantity @xmath13 under the interchange of @xmath1 and @xmath14 already noticed in ref.@xcite was interpreted as a possible evidence for a proton looking like a collection of independent dipoles of typical size @xmath15 .",
    "the generalized vector dominance model combined with the color dipole model as formulated in @xcite also leads to geometric scaling .",
    "more recently , geometric scaling for all @xmath7 was deduced from the critical behaviour of the correlation function of wilson lines which appears at small @xmath2 in a near - light - cone hamiltonian formalism @xcite .",
    "this approach looks fundamentally different from the other ones , in the sense that it does not rely on the parton model .",
    "most of the latter discussions were only concerned with inclusive quantities .",
    "the proton was assumed an homogeneous disk , and its size large with respect to the size of the probe , so that boundary effects could be neglected .",
    "the reason for these assumptions is the technical complication of the saturation equations when full dependence upon transverse coordinates is taken into account .",
    "however , one knows that the saturation scale itself depends on the impact parameter .",
    "indeed , it is related to the density of partons inside the proton , which obviously decreases smoothly when one moves from the center to the periphery .",
    "the saturation scale in the ideal case described before was only a kind of effective one .",
    "actually , it is theoretically not clear what this scale is in a real proton , because all momenta from @xmath16 to @xmath1 are _ a priori _ expected to contribute to cross sections .    the importance of impact parameter studies for the phenomenology of saturation effects at hera was explained in ref.@xcite .",
    "a theoretical discussion of the impact parameter dependence of the saturation scale @xmath17 was provided in  @xcite . in the latter paper , some arguments were put forward in favor of a `` local '' geometric scaling , which would manifest itself in the fact that cross sections for exclusive processes only depend on the ratio of scales @xmath18 .",
    "let us also stress that geometric scaling for exclusive processes has recently been predicted qualitatively in the context of the discussion of generalized parton distributions @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that `` local '' geometric scaling is testable experimentally . in the first section ,",
    "we explain why this new scaling is expected .",
    "we then propose a method to investigate it at hera .",
    "finally , we discuss the qualitative results obtained so far by applying our method to the data .",
    "in this section , we show how local scaling appears within different theoretical approaches .",
    "we consider the idealized process of scattering of a dipole of size @xmath19 off a dipole of size @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath1 are fixed momentum scales , which are taken in the perturbative region in the following discussion , and the ordering @xmath22 is assumed . the small dipole is called `` projectile '' and the large one `` target '' . in the end",
    ", @xmath21 will be formally extrapolated to @xmath23 .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 the maximum rapidity available at c.o.m . energy @xmath12 .",
    "we explore here the perturbative picture of high energy scattering .",
    "we consider dipole - dipole scattering at fixed impact parameter @xmath25 as given by the bfkl equation .",
    "we assume that @xmath25 is larger than the sizes of the initial - state dipoles : @xmath26 .",
    "the mellin representation of the solution of the bfkl equation then reads @xcite @xmath27 where the integration goes over a line in the complex plane parallel to the imaginary axis and intersecting the real axis between 0 and 1 . in our conventions ,",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 matrices are related by @xmath30 , so that generally speaking the amplitudes are essentially real at high energy .",
    "this is true in particular for the bfkl solution  ( [ eq : ampb ] ) .",
    "the following standard notations have been used : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the function @xmath33 is the mellin transform of the elementary dipole - dipole elastic amplitude with respect to the ratio of their sizes , with appropriate normalization .",
    "the forward amplitude @xmath34 is obtained by integrating  ( [ eq : ampb ] ) over the impact parameter @xmath25 . as formula  ( [ eq : ampb ] ) holds only in a large @xmath25 approximation , we must set the lower bound of the integral to a number of the order of the size of the largest interacting dipole .",
    "we choose @xmath35 and check the consistency a posteriori .",
    "the forward amplitude then reads @xmath36 one checks the normalizations by computing the total cross section , using the optical theorem which reads @xmath37 in our conventions . setting @xmath38 , one recovers the well - known expression of the elementary ( lowest order ) dipole - dipole cross section  @xcite .",
    "let us recall how one obtains geometric scaling from this equation .",
    "one is interested in the large @xmath39 region , where a saddle point gives the dominant contribution to the integral in  ( [ eq : forward ] ) . expanding the function @xmath40 to second order around @xmath41 , the amplitude  ( [ eq : forward ] ) reads @xmath42 with the definitions @xmath43 ( the bfkl intercept ) and @xmath44 . at fixed @xmath39 ,",
    "the amplitude becomes large ( of the order of the area of the target ) when the argument of the exponential is positive , which occurs below the scale @xmath45 satisfying the relation @xmath46 note that this formula can be compared with the form of the saturation scale previously quoted  ( [ eq : satscal1 ] ) provided one makes the identifications @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the equation @xmath49 defines the so - called critical line below which , per definition , the amplitude  ( [ eq : forward ] ) is large and non - linear corrections prove to be necessary to ensure probability conservation . the interesting feature of eq.([eq : saddleinter ] )",
    "is that it can be rewritten as a function of the ratio of the variables @xmath1 and @xmath14 , up to some approximation . putting  ( [ eq : saddleinter ] ) and  ( [ eq : satscal ] ) together , one arrives at @xmath50 the factor which still contains the rapidity alone is slowly varying , hence it can be approximated by its value for a fixed typical rapidity @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath1 is sufficiently close to @xmath14 , one can trade the exponential for @xmath52 .",
    "this approximation applies when @xmath53 . introducing the notation @xmath54",
    ", the amplitude rewrites @xmath55 which exhibits geometric scaling .    to make contact with hera phenomenology",
    ", one has to set @xmath56 and to average the projectile size @xmath57 with weight given by the squared photon wave function .",
    "this is the well - known dipole model @xcite which provides an appealing and useful picture of dis in the leading - logarithmic approximation of qcd .",
    "the virtual photon - proton cross section reads @xmath58 @xmath59 is the photon wave function on a @xmath60 colour dipole . besides the transverse size @xmath57 and virtuality of the photon @xmath1",
    ", this wave function also depends on the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath61 of the antiquark .",
    "the notation  `` @xmath62 '' stands for an integration over @xmath61 . for negligible quark masses",
    ", @xmath63 is a function of @xmath64 only which vanishes rapidly at large @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "thus the scaling property of the dipole - proton amplitude  ( [ eq : geof ] ) is transmitted to the photon - proton cross section itself which then exhibits the same behaviour as the amplitude @xmath34 in eq.([eq : geof ] ) .",
    "the formula just established would give a reasonable description of the data in a limited kinematical range , provided one considers @xmath65 and @xmath66 as effective parameters .",
    "indeed , the values given by the leading order bfkl equation are known to be incompatible with the data on one hand , and to receive large corrections from next - to - leading order terms on the other hand .",
    "the parameters have to be adjusted such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "then formulae  ( [ eq : satscal1 ] ) , ( [ eq : satscal ] ) show that the choice @xmath69 implies @xmath70 , which is reasonable .",
    "to obtain more reliable expressions , neglected effects such as diffusion into the infrared have to be taken into account . as shown in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the latter have sizable effects both on the parametric form of the saturation scale  ( [ eq : satscal ] ) and on the expression of the amplitude  ( [ eq : geof ] ) , but do not spoil the overall picture .",
    "the previous analysis can be taken over to the impact parameter dependent amplitude  ( [ eq : ampb ] ) in a straightforward way .",
    "the steepest - descent method gives ( see @xcite ) @xmath71 this amplitude is again of order @xmath52 for @xmath72 , the saturation scale @xmath14 being given by @xmath73 within the approximations already made in the inclusive case , the amplitude can then be expressed as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath14 only : @xmath74 where the saturation scale now depends on the impact parameter @xmath25 .",
    "thus we see that the amplitude for each impact parameter is a function of the ratio of the inverse size of the projectile and of the _ local _ saturation scale .",
    "however , the kinematical range in which formula  ( [ eq : scalingfinal ] ) may apply is quite restricted .",
    "let us set @xmath75 .",
    "we have required large impact parameters ( in practice , @xmath76 ) and @xmath14 close to @xmath1 , which has to sit in the perturbative regime ( @xmath77 ) . from formula  ( [ eq : satscal2 ] ) , one sees that the latter conditions require a large rapidity evolution , during which the saturation regime might already be reached for smaller impact parameters ( i.e. @xmath78 for some @xmath79 ) .",
    "it is not possible to quantify this effect without knowing the dynamics for all impact parameters .",
    "we shall now refer to another , maybe safer approach , which will however lead to comparable conclusions on `` local '' geometric scaling .      in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the argument that the quantum evolution was quasi - local in impact parameter was developed on the basis of an analysis of the non - linear evolution equations . as a result",
    ", the dipole - proton scattering amplitude at fixed impact parameter can be written in a factorized form , because the latter feature means that the impact parameter dependence remains unchanged throughout the rapidity evolution .",
    "the non - perturbative profile of the proton is introduced as an initial condition .",
    "the validity of such a factorization has been confirmed very recently in the context of @xmath80 reactions @xcite .",
    "the amplitude then reads @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the forward amplitude  ( [ eq : forward ] ) . above the saturation scale ,",
    "@xmath82 exhibits geometric scaling as seen on eq.([eq : geof ] ) , thus the amplitude @xmath83 also scales .",
    "the profile function @xmath84 was postulated ( we chose the normalization such that @xmath85 ) .",
    "it involves the long - distance scale @xmath86 , which is put by hand and interpreted as an initial condition .",
    "this leads once again to a scaling of the form  ( [ eq : scalingfinal ] ) , with a local saturation scale given by @xmath87 we see that this result is qualitatively close to eq.([eq : satscal2 ] ) , except for the @xmath25-dependence which is exponential rather than powerlike .",
    "this stems from the fact that non - perturbative physics with short range pion fields were introduced here , whereas previously only long - range coulomb - like fields were considered .    at this point",
    ", it may be useful to evaluate the saturation scale at hera from these formulae .",
    "for values of the rapidity @xmath39 of the order of those measured at hera in the small-@xmath2 region ( @xmath88 ) , one sees from formula  ( [ eq : satval2 ] ) that @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath14 reaches the value of @xmath16 at the impact parameter @xmath90 .",
    "this means that for a probe of size @xmath91 , the proton looks grey everywhere and extends up to a radius of about @xmath92 .",
    "as geometric scaling at fixed impact parameter seems to be a definite prediction of saturation models , it is worth testing it against the data .",
    "a former analysis @xcite has already shown the relevance of impact parameter dependent analysis in the discussion of saturation . there , the @xmath28-matrix element for dipole - proton scattering at fixed impact parameter was extracted from diffractive electro - production of vector mesons at hera .",
    "this quantity can be interpreted as a transparency coefficient , and thus quantifies the `` blackness '' of the proton as seen by the projectile .",
    "such kind of analysis is always model - dependent , since to get the correct normalization of the @xmath28-matrix element , one has to rely on an _ ad hoc _ model for the final - state vector meson . although it was shown in ref.@xcite that requiring that the initial state be a _ longitudinal _",
    "photon limits the model - dependence , an estimated uncertainty of 20% was still recognized .",
    "however , dependence of the cross section on a scaling variable can be tested in a model - independent way .",
    "the scattering amplitude at fixed impact parameter can be extracted from differential cross sections for high energy quasi - elastic processes by a fourier transform with respect to the momentum transfer . by quasi - elastic",
    "we mean that the initial and final states have the same number of particles . in practice",
    ", the process we are thinking of will be diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons .",
    "let us consider such a quasi - elastic process .",
    "its amplitude @xmath93 is related to the differential cross section through the formula @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the usual mandelstam variable and all other dependences are implied . at high energies , it is well - known that the scattering amplitude @xmath93 is essentially real .",
    "formula  ( [ eq : differential ] ) shows that @xmath96 is proportional to the square root of the differential cross section @xmath97 .",
    "a further fourier transform with respect to the two - dimensional momentum transfer then gives the scattering amplitude for a fixed impact parameter @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a bessel function . for formula  ( [ eq : transfo ] ) to be valid , it is important that the quasi - elastic final state be well identified as a _",
    "single _ particle or resonance . a more complex final state like @xmath100 ( which is what is actually observed in the experiments ) can proceed through several different channels ( with intermediate states @xmath101 , @xmath65 , @xmath102 ... ) .",
    "its study would require the careful treatment of phases and interference effects , see for example refs.@xcite .",
    "we shall assume that we have a single - channel process , and we use formula  ( [ eq : transfo ] ) to extract the @xmath25-dependent amplitude from the available data .",
    "we shall now be more specific , specializing to the case of electroproduction of vector mesons @xmath103 , where @xmath104 will in practice be a @xmath101 meson .",
    "the picture is the following . at high energy ,",
    "the photon splits into a dipole of fixed size @xmath57 which scatters off the proton before recombining into a meson . due to its high relative velocity ,",
    "the dipole does not change size during the scattering .",
    "accordingly , the scattering amplitude @xmath93 is the convolution of the photon wave function @xmath59 , the meson wave - function @xmath105 and the dipole amplitude @xmath83 in the same way as in eq.([eq : conv ] ) @xmath106 the forward amplitude @xmath107 appearing in  ( [ eq : conv ] ) being replaced by the impact parameter dependent one @xmath83 . due to the fact that the product of the wave functions @xmath108 is peaked around a typical dipole size depending only on the external transverse momentum scales , the scaling of the dipole amplitude @xmath83 ( see eqs.([eq : scalingfinal ] ) )",
    "is transmitted to the photon - proton amplitude @xmath93 . as it is well - known from both empirical tests @xcite and experimental @xcite studies ,",
    "the relevant distance scale at the photon - meson vertex is a combination of the photon virtuality @xmath1 and of the meson mass @xmath109 , namely @xmath110 instead of @xmath19 as in the case of inclusive scattering .",
    "we then obtain from eqs.([eq : satscal2 ] ) , ( [ eq : satval2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : scalingfinal ] ) that the amplitude @xmath93 in eq.([eq : ampinter ] ) should be a function of the scaling variable @xmath111 only , once the impact parameter @xmath25 is fixed .",
    "to check this statement , we apply the transformation  ( [ eq : transfo ] ) to the hera published data on electroproduction of @xmath112 vector mesons . in the presently published experimental analysis @xcite , the total cross section as well as the logarithmic @xmath95-slope @xmath113 are quoted .",
    "the data can then be represented by the parametrization @xmath114 up to @xmath115 of the order of @xmath116 , which corresponds to the range in which data have been collected .",
    "the scattering amplitude at each impact parameter reads @xmath117 we take the total cross section from @xcite .",
    "the kinematical range of these measurements is shown on fig.[fig : kin ] .",
    "the experimental points range from @xmath118 to @xmath119 and @xmath120 to @xmath121 . due to the lack of data for the slope @xmath113 for all values of @xmath7 and @xmath122",
    ", we shall assume @xmath123 all quantities appearing in the previous formula being expressed in powers of 1  gev .",
    "the parametrization  ( [ eq : b ] ) at @xmath124 is taken from  @xcite .",
    "a logarithmic energy dependence has been added according to the donnachie - landshoff parametrization for the pomeron  @xcite .",
    "we set the regge slope @xmath125 to the value @xmath126 which is measured in hadron - hadron cross sections .",
    "the relevance of this choice and its implications will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the results of our analysis are displayed on fig.[fig : local ] for three different impact parameters , @xmath127 .",
    "needless to say , our plot is only illustrative of the method and , being theoreticians , we can not provide a quantitative analysis .",
    "the error bars shown take into account only the error on the total cross section ( @xmath128 ) and the contour gives a rough idea of the total uncertainty , evaluated as if they were uncorrelated and small by the formula @xmath129 we assumed an error on the slope @xmath113 of 5% which seems realistic regarding the quality of recently measured data ( see the @xmath130 analysis of @xcite ) .",
    "we see from  ( [ eq : uncertainty ] ) that the uncertainty on @xmath113 affects mostly the large impact parameter region . for small @xmath25 ,",
    "an additional error would come from the fact that the data does not extend to arbitrarily large @xmath115 , hence the exponential form  ( [ eq : expo ] ) is not constrained for small @xmath25 .",
    "this is the reason why we performed our analysis only down to impact parameters as large as 0.3  fm ( see @xcite for a more complete discussion ) .    the results on fig.[fig : local ] are consistent with `` local '' geometric scaling within uncertainties , for each of the displayed impact parameters .",
    "although the kinematical range of the data is not very large , scaling is a non - trivial feature since data points of different @xmath1 and @xmath122 overlap , as seen on fig.[fig : kin ] .",
    "we stress that from the technical point of view , the fact that the scaling holds for _ various _ values of @xmath25 comes from a subtle interplay between the @xmath131 dependence of @xmath132 and @xmath113 in formula  ( [ eq : expo ] ) .",
    "finally , let us note that the data points denoted by a cross correspond to very low values of @xmath7 ( @xmath133 ) , and are kinematically quite separated from the other data .",
    "as they are measured with a different method , we do not make a point of the fact that they do not seem to lie on the same curve as the larger @xmath7 data .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated that `` local '' geometric scaling , predicted by the saturation models for deep - inelastic scattering , is compatible with the hera data .",
    "however , a consistent experimental analysis with careful treatment of uncertainties as well as an extension of the kinematical range is needed to draw a strong conclusion .",
    "in particular , an extension of the range in @xmath122 would enable us to compare measurements sitting at very different @xmath7 but at the same scaling variable @xmath134 .",
    "this would constitute a definite test of this local scaling .    nevertheless , let us note the surprizing fact that scaling seems to work well for large impact parameters , very far from the center of the proton , and even outside the `` grey '' zone ( @xmath135 ) , where the concept of saturation scale makes little sense .",
    "this feature depends of course a lot on the form of the measured @xmath113 , and particularly on its energy dependence , which was introduced in an _ ad hoc _ way in eq.([eq : b ] ) .",
    "interestingly enough , if the energy dependence were less steep for large momentum transfers @xmath136 , scaling would also be slightly better verified at small impact parameters .",
    "such a feature is likely to happen since it seems that the harder the momentum scales , the weaker the energy - dependence of the @xmath95-slope .",
    "this rule of thumb is most seen in large-@xmath95 proton - dissociative photoproduction of @xmath101 mesons @xcite , although of course it is not a quasi - elastic process and our analysis would not apply .",
    "moreover , recent preliminary experimental results indicate that @xmath125 is smaller than the donnachie - landshoff value , and decreases with the scale @xmath137 .",
    "if scaling were confirmed also for large impact parameters , it might be an indication of some more general symmetry of high energy dynamics .",
    "one would in principle be able to plot all data for different @xmath25 as a function of a unique scaling variable @xmath138 , see formula  ( [ eq : scalingfinal ] ) .",
    "however , we checked that the parametrizations for the saturation scale proposed so far in eqs.([eq : satscal ] ) , ( [ eq : satscal2 ] ) do not lead to a superposition of all points on a single curve .",
    "this means that the available approaches to the computation of the impact parameter dependence of the saturation scale are not good enough yet .",
    "the theoretical status of the impact parameter dependence of the saturation scale is still unclear , mainly due to technical difficulties in solving the full saturation equations .",
    "better insights into these issues would help a lot the understanding of high energy scattering within qcd .",
    "important issues like unitarity problems require a good understanding of the evolution in impact parameter @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for a model which predicts such an evolution ) .",
    "on the experimental side , diffractive vector meson production in dis is being investigated intensively at hera @xcite , and more data will be available soon .",
    "we believe that it would be worth to plot the forthcoming data in the way we propose in this paper .",
