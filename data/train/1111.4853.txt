    "since the work of yau @xcite in 1975 , where the liouville property for positive harmonic functions on complete manifolds with non - negative ricci curvature was proved , the structure of various spaces of harmonic functions have been at the heart of geometric analysis .",
    "some years later , yau conjectured that the space of polynomial growth harmonic functions of fixed order is always finite dimensional in open manifolds with non - negative ricci curvature .",
    "extensive literature has appeared on this conjecture and related problems .",
    "understanding progressed quickly ( yau s conjecture was proved by colding and minicozzi @xcite ) and gave birth to many tools ( see @xcite for an introduction to the subject ) . in algebraic setting bounded harmonic functions played a central role since the introduction of the poisson boundary by furstenberg @xcite , see also the survey @xcite .",
    "recently , the geometric approach made a remarkable appearance in the algebraic realm when kleiner proved that the space of harmonic functions with polynomial growth on the cayley graph of a group with fixed polynomial volume growth is finite dimensional using the approach of @xcite .",
    "he used this fact to provide a new proof of gromov s theorem @xcite ( see @xcite for a quantitative version of this theorem ) .",
    "another place where harmonic functions have played an important role recently is in the proof of the central limit theorem on random graphs . a central element in the proofs ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) is the construction of a harmonic function @xmath2 on the cluster which is close to linear  the term @xmath3 is called the corrector and once one shows that @xmath4 , the proof may proceed .",
    "the focus of this article is the case of random graphs .",
    "classical tools of geometric analysis do not extend to this context in a straightforward way .",
    "indeed , a random environment is not regular at the microscopic scale . in order to understand harmonic functions ,",
    "one thus needs to control the macroscopic behavior of the environment .",
    "let us take supercritical percolation as an example ( see @xcite for background and definitions ) .    for @xmath5 , consider the random graph @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 and @xmath8 being a random set containing each edge of @xmath0 with probability @xmath9 , independently of the other edges .",
    "it is classical that there exists @xmath10 such that for @xmath11 , there is almost surely no infinite connected component ( also called cluster ) , while for @xmath12 , there is a unique infinite cluster .",
    "when @xmath12 , we denote this cluster by @xmath13 .",
    "[ thm : percolation ] let @xmath14 and let @xmath12 . then with probability 1 , the infinite cluster @xmath13 has no non - constant sub - linear harmonic functions .",
    "this immediately shows that the corrector @xmath15 is unique , as was conjectured by berger and biskup ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 3 ) .    in more regular settings , claims of this sort have been proved using the following strategy : try to show that two random walks starting at neighbors will couple before time @xmath16 with probability bigger than @xmath17 .",
    "this fact is classical in the case of the hypercubic lattice @xmath0 where an explicit coupling can be exhibited . in the random context",
    "it is not clear how to construct an explicit coupling , but a number of approaches in the literature allow to construct a coupling indirectly .",
    "the known gaussian heat kernel bounds ( see below ) allow to construct a coupling that will fail with probability @xmath18 .",
    "using also the central limit theorem already mentioned , one could improve this to @xmath19 . nevertheless , getting",
    "the precise @xmath20 seems difficult with these approaches .",
    "the approach we will apply below not only gives the precise order @xmath20 , but the proof is also significantly simpler than those just suggested .",
    "the proof uses an entropy argument similar to avez @xcite who showed that a cayley graph satisfies the liouville property if the entropy of random walk on it is sublinear .",
    "in fact the `` if '' here is an `` if and only if '' as was shown by kaimanovich & vershik @xcite and , with a different approach , by derriennic @xcite , but we will not need the other direction .",
    "two extensions were known before for this result : it applies to random graphs @xcite and it can be quantified ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) .",
    "it turns out that both generalizations can be applied simultaneously .",
    "further , theorem [ thm : percolation ] is but an example : the techniques work in great generality , even reversibility is not needed .",
    "only stationarity of the walk and some weak ( sub-)diffusivity are used .",

    "stationary environments are very common and we provide ten examples in the end of section [ sec : entropy ] . most of these examples are embedded in @xmath0 and for these we could have used a much simpler definition  there is no need to `` couple the environments such that the resulting rooted markov chains are isomorphic with probability 1 '' .",
    "one could just say that they have the same law considered as a random function @xmath37 $ ] , after shifting @xmath36 to @xmath38 ( formally this is a stronger requirement , but all our examples embeddable into @xmath0 have it ) .",
    "however , examples [ exmp : poisson ] , [ exmp : gw ] and [ exmp : uipq ] are not embeddable into @xmath0 , and we found no simpler definition that catches all examples of interest . a very important subset of stationary environments is given by environments @xmath22 with the structure of a weighted graph ( with the weight being a positive function @xmath39 on every couple @xmath40 , and @xmath41 on every couple @xmath42 ) .",

    "let us expand on the particular application in kleiner s proof of gromov s theorem .",
    "it was known before kleiner that to show gromov s theorem it is enough to show that any group with polynomial volume growth has a non - trivial finite - dimensional representation .",
    "kleiner showed that any group has a non - trivial linearly growing harmonic function , and that groups with polynomial growth have a finite dimension of those ( even of polynomially growing functions ) .",
    "since the group acts on harmonic functions on its cayley graph by translations , this provides a finite dimension representation and proves gromov s theorem .",
    "shalom and tao @xcite showed that a quantitative version of kleiner s proof can be performed .",
    "further , they characterized the linearly growing harmonic functions  for groups with polynomial volume growth these are the non - constant harmonic functions with minimal growth ( * ? ? ? * theorem 6.1 ) ) .",
    "they showed ( personal communication ) that when the group is nilpotent , any such function must be a character of the group ( or the sum of a character and a constant ) , in analogy to the choquet - deny theorem @xcite .",
    "for virtually nilpotent groups this holds mutatis mutandis .",
    "we plan to analyze harmonic functions with minimal growth in the context of cayley graphs , especially of wreath products , in a future paper .",
    "we now return to the setting of this paper , i.e.  of stationary random graphs . using the entropy of the random walk , it is possible to bound from below the minimal growth of non - constant harmonic functions in terms of the rate of escape of the random walk .",
    "a particularly interesting case is the case of stationary environments with diffusive behavior , for which the bound is often sharp .",
    "a stationary environment @xmath29 satisfies _ diffusive or sub - diffusive behaviour _",
    "@xmath58 if @xmath59 where here and below @xmath60 is the average over both the environment and over the walk ( the so - called annealed average ) . we may now state our main result :    [ no sublinear harmonic ] let @xmath29 be a stationary environment such that @xmath61 for some constants @xmath62 independent of @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath29 satisfies , then for almost every environment , there are no non - constant sublinear harmonic functions .",
    "as already stated , it applies to many different models , some of them significantly less well - understood than percolation . see a list of examples at the end of section  [ sec : entropy ] .",
    "whether follows from polynomial growth in the reversible case is an interesting question .",
    "the carne - varopoulos bound @xcite gives that @xmath63 which would give ( with the same proof as that of theorem [ no sublinear harmonic ] , see theorem [ no sublinear harmonic] in section [ sec : entropy ] ) that any stationary random graph with polynomial volume growth has no non - constant harmonic functions @xmath2 with @xmath64 . without stationarity the carne - varopoulos bound @xmath65 can not be improved , as was shown by barlow & perkins @xcite .",
    "kesten gave a beautiful argument that a stationary random graph embedded in @xmath0 satisfies , see _",
    "e.g. _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) .",
    "but it does not seem to apply just assuming polynomial growth .",

    "of course , one can encounter very different behavior depending on the environment ( like in the deterministic case ) .",
    "hence we will assume that our environments satisfy volume doubling and poincar inequality .",
    "in this section we do not assume stationarity , and hence we do not need a root for our graph .",
    "the object of interest is therefore simply a random weighted graph @xmath66 .",

    "the minimal @xmath16 from which the properties hold may depend both on the environment and on @xmath71 .",
    "these properties are classical in geometric analysis .",
    "they go back to the theory developed by de giorgi , nash and moser @xcite in the fifties and sixties for uniformly elliptic second - order operators in divergence form . in the deterministic context",
    ", they imply the harnack principle and gaussian bounds for the heat kernel .",
    "the versions above are tailored for the random case : they take into consideration that in most examples of interest these properties do not hold from every point since some unusual points always exist .",
    "so we require that they hold for balls which are not too far from our root @xmath36 , relative to their size .",
    "this is reminiscent of barlow s good and very good balls @xcite , but our requirements are much weaker , we only need the properties to hold for `` macroscopic balls '' , balls whose distance to @xmath36 is proportional to their size .",
    "let us remark on the appearance of the number 2 in @xmath72 in both properties .",
    "for the volume doubling property it is clear that these properties are equivalent for all choices bigger than 1 _ i.e. _  if one were to define a `` 3-volume doubling property '' then it would be equivalent to the `` 2-volume doubling property '' defined above , though perhaps with different @xmath70{vd}}}}$ ] and minimal @xmath16 .",
    "the same holds for the poincar inequality , under the assumption of volume doubling .",
    "this is well known in deterministic settings , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , and the proof carries over to the random case with no change .    with these definitions we can state the following easy but , we believe , conceptually important",
    "theorem :    [ finite dimension ] let @xmath66 be a random weighted graph ( not necessarily stationary ) . if @xmath66 satisfies and , then for every @xmath73 , the space of harmonic functions with @xmath74 for all @xmath25 large enough , is finite dimensional .",

    "we sum up : @xmath533    as before , percolation can be seen as a stationary random graph , and it is sufficient to prove @xmath534 where @xmath535 and @xmath536 depend only on @xmath77 and the percolation probability @xmath9 .",
    "also note that one can restrict ourselves to @xmath537 , since in the regime @xmath538 , the heat kernel decreases fast enough so that one can tune the constant @xmath536 in order to obtain the result for free .",
    "again we use the variables @xmath539 from ( [ a],[eq : stretched ] ) . take @xmath323 to be given by the stretched exponential bound for @xmath539 , .",
    "fix @xmath540 .",
    "let @xmath541 .",
    "so the gaussian estimates imply that for a.e .",

    "recall also that lemma [ lem : alln ] from the previous section says that for critical percolation @xmath445 for all @xmath16 .",
    "together these give @xmath549           \\le 4d(d+1)~\\frac{c\\cdot c_3 ^ 2}{n^{d+1}}\\exp\\big[-c_4|x|^2/n\\big].\\ ] ] we do not need to control the behavior of the gradient on @xmath550 since this event has probability at most @xmath551 .",

    "\\cdot \\frac{c_3 ^ 2}{n^{d+1}}\\exp\\big[-c_4|x|^2/n\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] putting all the pieces together , we obtain the result .",
    "the proof involved only gaussian estimates at mesoscopic scale and the entropy argument .",
    "it extends to other contexts such as random conductances satisfying the uniform elliptic condition ( see example [ random conductance ] ) .",
    "one may then get , using convolution , annealed second space - derivative and first time - derivative estimates for the heat kernel using the first space - derivative estimates .",
    "we refer to section 5 of @xcite for more details .",
    "this study must be understood as an introduction and some initial steps in the subject .",
    "there are many natural questions on harmonic functions which remain open .",
    "we present few of them in this section .",
    "the question of minimal growth harmonic functions was implicitly studied in the literature : the failure of the liouville property corresponds to a special case of minimal growth .",
    "when the the liouville property is true , it becomes interesting to determine the minimal growth .",
    "even the deterministic case ( _ i.e. _  transitive or cayley graphs ) has interesting phenomenology and we plan to analyze some examples in a future paper .",
    "note that groups always admit linear growth harmonic functions @xcite .",
    "this is no longer the case for stationary random graphs . when the random walk is subdiffusive ( note that the random walk on cayley graphs is at least diffusive , a result due to erschler , see lee and peres @xcite ) , theorem [ no sublinear harmonic] ( page ) implies a phenomenon which is specific to random environments :      therefore graphical fractals , uipq , critical galton - watson trees conditioned to survive and the incipient infinite cluster ( iic ) do not admit linear growth harmonic functions .",
    "we mention that it was already proved @xcite that the uniform infinite planar triangulation is almost surely liouville .",
    "there are no non - constant harmonic functions on the critical galton - watson tree or on the iic as both have infinitely many cut vertices . indeed , the galton - watson tree is well - known to be one - ended and hence , as a tree , must have infinitely many cut vertices",
    ". the existence of cut points for the iic is essentially known , but we did not find a reference and including a full proof would take us too far off - topic .",
    "cayley graphs with polynomial growth automatically satisfy the volume doubling property and the poincar inequality , thus implying that spaces of harmonic functions with prescribed polynomial growth are finite dimensional .",
    "the possibility of such behavior in the case of stationary random graphs of polynomial volume growth is a legitimate question .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that we do not necessarily have poincar inequality at our disposal ( in the case of the uipq for instance ) .",
    "therefore , we can not use the technology developed in section [ sec : polynomial growth ] in the general context .",
    "we mention that there exists another strategy to prove finite dimensionality , proposed in @xcite , relying on the following weaker statement : for every harmonic function @xmath2 on @xmath45 and @xmath227 : @xmath553 where is @xmath127 a constant independent of @xmath25 and @xmath16 .",
    "this inequality appears in standard proofs of elliptic harnack inequalities and holds for a larger class than those satisfying the doubling volume property and poincar inequality .",
    "still one can not expect it to hold in graphs with small `` bottlenecks '' like the uipq .",
    "the computation of the dimension of spaces of harmonic functions does not restrict to the case of linear growth harmonic functions .",
    "for a graph @xmath45 and @xmath73 , let @xmath554 $ ] be the dimension of the space of harmonic functions with growth bounded by a polynomial of degree @xmath78 .",
    "the similarity between @xmath0 and the infinite cluster of percolation might extend to the dimension of the space of harmonic functions with arbitrary polynomial growth .",
    "more precisely , we ask the following question :        it is natural to ask if an invariance principle for the random walk in the random environment @xmath13 implies that the sequence @xmath555)$ ] coincides with @xmath556)$ ] . on @xmath0 , diffusivity and the invariance principle are robust under rough isometry .",
    "therefore , one can ask if @xmath557)_{k\\geq 0}$ ] is invariant under rough isometry for these kind of graphs . this is not true in general . for instance",
    ", liouville property is not invariant under rough isometry ( see @xcite for the first example or @xcite for a simpler one ) .",
    "more generally , one can ask whether a small perturbation of a cayley graph modifies drastically the harmonic functions on it . for instance , consider percolation on a cayley graph @xmath45 such that @xmath558 ( the infimum of the values for which there exists a _ unique _ infinite cluster ) is strictly smaller than 1 .",
    "fix @xmath559 and set @xmath560 to be the unique infinite cluster of the percolation with parameter @xmath9 .        in the context of cayley graphs ,",
    "the space of harmonic functions with a certain growth rate is crucial in the study of the underlying group .",
    "indeed , the latter acts on harmonic functions naturally . in the random",
    "setting , we do not have this interpretation .",
    "nevertheless , an interesting question is to understand what information on the random graph is encoded in the sequence @xmath557)_{k\\geq 0}$ ] . in particular , the following question would be a first step in this direction :        we wish to thank ofer zeitouni for pointing out that the entropy argument works also in non - reversible setting , and russell lyons for directing us to @xcite .",
