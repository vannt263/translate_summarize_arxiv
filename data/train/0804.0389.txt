    "current studies to extract the properties of a dark energy component of the universe from observational data focus on the determination of its equation of state @xmath7 ( see @xcite ) , which is the ratio of the dark energy s pressure to its energy density @xmath8 .",
    "chevallier and polarski @xcite and linder @xcite proposed the following parameterization of the equation of state : @xmath9 hereafter simply cpl , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are real numbers .",
    "it is usually assumed to parameterize our ignorance about the dynamics of dark energy , and was in particular extensively used by the dark energy task force @xcite as a phenomenological benchmark to compare and contrast the performances of different dark energy probes ( see @xcite ) . despite its simplicity the cpl parameterization exhibits interesting properties as discussed in detail by linder @xcite .",
    "in particular , the two parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 have a natural physical interpretation : they represent the equation of state s present value and its overall time evolution , respectively .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that the best description of @xmath11 in terms of the derivative of @xmath12 is given by the relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the logarithmic derivative of @xmath12 defined as @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the scale factor of the universe .",
    "moreover linder and huterer @xcite and upadhye et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that at most a two - parameter model can optimally be constrained by future data .",
    "additional major properties are its bounded behaviour for high redshift ( @xmath17 ) and its ability to describe a large variety of scalar field dark energy models .",
    "consequently , the cpl parameterization seems to be a good compromise to define a model independent analysis .",
    "+ unfortunately , it can not describe all possible dynamics @xcite , which fact can easily be understood by looking at the dark energy dynamics in the ( @xmath18)-phase space .",
    "the cpl parameterization can be re - casted in the following form : @xmath19 that highlights the linear relation between @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "a discussion of characteristic phase space properties of several classes of dark energy models can be found in @xcite .",
    "it appears that some subclasses are well described by an approximation like eq.([lintraj ] ) , but that in general dark energy models do not follow a linear trajectory .",
    "linder @xcite himself for instance argues , that eq.([cpl ] ) will hardly be able to handle rapid transitions or oscillations .",
    "consequently there is an unavoidable degree of `` parameterization dependence '' in the results .",
    "this rather obvious fact has motivated many different approaches to test the dark energy dynamics .",
    "not only other parameterizations of dark energy s equation of state have been considered @xcite , but also parameterizations of the dark energy density alone @xcite , or of the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "finally non - parametric tests have been studied @xcite , see @xcite for a general discussion . since cpl is widely implemented in both observational and theoretical studies , it is essential to test its robustness in reconstructing the dynamics of physically motivated dark energy models .    focusing on quintessence models , caldwell and linder @xcite have shown that the subclasses comprising the so - called `` freezing '' and `` thawing '' models are well parameterized by the cpl functional form , whereas corasaniti and copeland @xcite pointed out that certain models , in particular the `` tracker models '' @xcite , would be better described by an equation of state of step - like functional form .",
    "step - like functions are able to describe slow or rapid transitions between two asymptotic values , their modeling is however somewhat arbitrary : a fermi - function has been used by bassett et al .",
    "@xcite , a linear combination of fermi - functions by corasaniti and copeland @xcite , a power - law behaviour by hannestad and mrtsell @xcite , an e - fold model by linder and huterer @xcite , and hyperbolic tangent functions by pogosian et al .",
    "@xcite and douspis et al .",
    "the main drawback of such step - like equations of state is the necessity to introduce four parameters .",
    "given that large number of degrees of freedom , this kind of parameterization does therefore not seem to be the appropriate choice to extract constraints from data , even if an interesting and non - trivial study in this direction has been done in @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we however propose to test the significance of the physical information enclosed in the cpl parameterization , obtained from a fiducial cosmology that is described by a step - like model of dark energy . for",
    "if we take seriously the task of testing a possibly wide range of dark energy models with future cosmological probes like snap / jdem , we will have to use a parameterization of dark energy s equation of state .",
    "but if we do not want to take the risk of exluding a model on the basis of a parameterization that may not be the appropriate description of the actual dark energy phenomenology , we will have to quantitatively know the intrinsic limitiations of the specific parameterization we chose .",
    "+ in the following section [ approach ] we present and discuss the explicit functional form of our fiducial model , and set up our data framework consisting of supernova ia data as forecasted for a satellite mission like snap / jdem in combination with future expectations for the cmb shift parameter @xmath2 and the bao parameter @xmath3 . after a discussion of our analysis strategy we will",

    "these expected errors on magnitudes correspond to a long term scenario ( 2015 - 2020 ) , or a stage iv data model as defined in the report of the dark energy task force @xcite .",
