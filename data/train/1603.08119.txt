    "community networks or do - it - yourself networks ( diys ) are bottom - up built decentralized networks , deployed and maintained by their own users . in the early 2000s , community networks ( cns ) gained momentum in response to the limited options for network connectivity in rural and urban communities",
    ". one successful effort of such a network is guifi.net , located in the catalonia region of spain .",
    "guifi.net is defined as an open , free and neutral community network built by its members : citizens and organizations pooling their resources and coordinating efforts to build and operate a local network infrastructure .",
    "guifi.net was launched in 2004 and till today it has grown into a network of more than 30.000 operational nodes , which makes it the largest community network worldwide @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : traffic_guifi ] shows the evolution of total inbound and outbound guifi.net traffic to the internet for the last two years .",
    "pink represents incoming traffic from internet and yellow represents outgoing traffic . for two years",
    "the traffic is doubled and peaks are as a result of a new links and fiber optics in the backbone .",
    "similar to other community networks , guifi.net aims to create a highly localized digital ecosystem .",
    "however , the predominant usage we have observed , is to access the cloud - based internet services external to a community network .",
    "for instance , more than 50% of the user - oriented services consumed in guifi.net are gateway proxies that provide internet connectivity hence impose a heavy burden on the limit backbone links @xcite . for a very long time in the past , user - oriented services had not been developed locally because of lacking streamlined mechanisms to exploit all the available resources within a community network as well as other technological barriers . with the adoption of _ _ community network micro - clouds _ _",
    ", i.e. , the platform that enables cloud - based services in community networks , local user - oriented services gathered a huge momentum .",
    "community network users started creating their own homegrown services and using alternative open source software for many of today s internet cloud services , e.g. , data storage services , interactive applications such as voice - over - ip ( voip ) , video streaming , p2p - tv , and etc .",
    "in fact , a significant amount of services were already locally deployed and running within guifi.net including guifitv , graph servers , mail servers , game servers @xcite .",
    "all these services are provided by individuals , social groups , small non - profit or commercial service providers . because guifi.net nodes are geographically distributed , given this set of local services , we need to decide where",
    "these services should be placed in a network .",
    "obviously , without taking into account the underlying network resources , a service may suffer from poor performance , e.g , by sending up large amounts of data across slow wireless links while faster and more reliable links remain underutilized .",
    "therefore , the key challenge in community network micro - clouds is to determine the location , i.e. servers at certain geographic points in the network , where the different services multiplexed on a shared infrastructure will be running . while conceptually straightforward , it is challenging to calculate an optimal decision due to the dynamic nature of community networks and usage patterns . in this work",
    "we aim to address the following question : _ `` given a community network cloud infrastructure , what is an effective and low - complexity service placement solution that maximises end - to - end performance ( e.g. , bandwidth ) ? ''",
    "_ our preliminary results show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms the current random placement adopted in guifi.net by 35% regarding its bandwidth gain .",
    "more importantly , as the number of services increases , the gain tends to increase accordingly .",
    "[ sec : qmp ]",
    "in this section , we characterize wireless community networks by presenting our experimental measurements in a production example over five months , which exposes the necessity of deploying localized services @xcite and justifies our motivation of proposing an intelligent placement algorithm .",
    "the network we consider , began deployment in 2009 in a quarter of the city of barcelona , spain , called sants , as part of the _ quick mesh project _ ( qmp ) . in 2012 , nodes from _ universitat politcnica de catalunya _ ( upc ) joined the network , supported by the eu confine project .",
    "we shall refer to this network as _ qmpsu _ ( from quick mesh project at sants - upc ) .",
    "qmpsu is part of the guifi community network which has more than @xmath0 operational nodes . at the time of writing",
    ", qmpsu has around 61 nodes , 16 at upc and 45 at sants .",
    "there are two gateways , one in upc campus and another in sants , that connect qmpsu to the rest of guifi.net ( see figure [ fig : qmpsantsupc ] ) .",
    "a detailed description of qmpsu can be found in @xcite , and a live monitoring page updated hourly is available in the internet .",
    "typically , qmpsu users have an outdoor router ( or ) with a wi - fi interface on the roof , connected through ethernet to an indoor ap ( access point ) as a premises network .",
    "the most common or in qmpsu is the nanostation m5 , which integrates a sectorial antenna with a router furnished with a wireless 802.11an interface .",
    "some strategic locations have several nanostations , that provide larger coverage .",
    "in addition , some links of several kilometers are set up with parabolic antennas ( nanobridges ) .",
    "ors in qmpsu are flashed with the linux distribution which was developed inside the qmp project wihich is a branch of openwrt and uses bmx6 as the mesh routing protocol @xcite .      in the following ,",
    "we characterize the network performance of qmp network .",
    "our goal is to determine the key features of the network and its nodes ; in particular to understand the network metrics that could help us to design new heuristic frameworks for intelligent service placement in community networks @xcite .",
    "measurements have been obtained by connecting via ssh to each qmpsu or and running basic system commands available in the qmp distribution .",
    "this method has the advantage that no changes or additional software need to be installed in the nodes .",
    "live measurements have been taken hourly over the last 5 months , starting from october 2015 to february 2016 .",
    "we use this data to analyse main aspects of qmp network .",
    "+     +     +     +     +     +    figure [ fig : presence ] shows the node and link presence .",
    "we define presence as the percentage a given node or link is observed over the captures .",
    "overall , 90 different nodes were detected . from those ,",
    "only 61 were alive during the all measurement period , leading to a presence higher than 98% .",
    "around 30 nodes were missed in majority of the captures ( i.e. , presence less than 10% ) .",
    "these are temporarily working nodes from other mesh networks and laboratory devices used for various experiments .",
    "figure [ fig : presence ] also reveals that 56% of links used between nodes are unidirectional and others are bidirectional .",
    "figure [ fig : traffic - bh - ecdf ] , depicts the empirical cumulative distribution function ( ecdf ) of the average traffic sent in each of the links in the busy hour .",
    "the overall average traffic observed is 70 kbps .",
    "figure [ fig : link - traffic ] shows the average traffic in both directions ( upload / download ) of the three busiest links .",
    "we characterize the wireless links of the qmp network by studying their throughput .",
    "figure [ fig : bw - ecdf ] shows the ecdf of the throughput of the links .",
    "the figure shows that the link throughput can be fitted with an exponential distribution with mean  21.8 mbps . in order to see the variability of the throughput , figure [ fig : link - bw ]",
    "shows the throughput averages in both directions ( upload and download ) of the three busiest links ( same links as in figure [ fig : link - traffic ] ) .",
    "when we compare the figure [ fig : link - bw ] and figure [ fig : link - traffic ] , we observe that the throughput is slightly affected by the traffic in the links .",
    "solid and dashed lines are used to identify the measurements on each direction of the links ( dashed line for download , solid line for upload ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the asymmetry of the throughputs measured in both directions it not always due to the asymmetry of the user traffic . for instance ( node gsgranvia255 )",
    ", around 6 am , when the user traffic is the lowest and equal in both directions , the asymmetry of the links throughputs observed in figure [ fig : traffic - bh - ecdf ] remains the same .",
    "we thus conclude that this asymmetry must be due to the link characteristics , as level of interferences present at each end , or different transmission powers .",
    "a significant amount of applications that run on guifi.net and qmp network are network - intensive ( bandwidth and delay sensitive ) , transferring large amounts of data between the network nodes @xcite .",
    "the performance of such kind of applications depends not just on computational and disk resources but also on the network bandwidth between the nodes on which they are deployed . therefore , the placement of such services in the network is of high importance . here",
    "are some observations ( features ) that we captured from the measurements in qmp network :    * qmp network is highly dynamic and diverse due to many reasons , e.g. , its community nature in an urban area ; its decentralised organic growth with extensive diversity in the technological choices for hardware , wireless media , link protocols , channels , routing protocols etc . ; its mesh nature in the network etc .",
    "the current network deployment model is based on geographic singularities rather than qos .",
    "the network is not scale - free .",
    "the topology is organic and different for conventional isp network . *",
    "the resources are not uniformly distributed in the network .",
    "wireless links are with asymmetric quality for services ( 30% of the links have a deviation higher than 30% ) .",
    "we observed a highly skewed traffic pattern ( figure [ fig : traffic - bh - ecdf ] ) and highly skewed bandwidth distribution ( figure [ fig : bw - ecdf ] ) .",
    "currently used _ organic ( random ) placement scheme _ in guifi.net community network is not sufficient to capture the dynamics of the network and therefore it fails to deliver the satisfying qos .",
    "the strong assumption under random service placement , i.e. , uniform distribution of resources , does not hold in such environments .",
    "furthermore , the services deployed have different qos requirements .",
    "services that require intensive inter - component communication ( e.g streaming service ) , can perform better if the replicas ( service components ) are placed close to each other in high capacity links @xcite . on other side , bandwidth - intensive services ( e.g. , distributed storage , video - on - demand )",
    "can perform much better if their replicas are as close as possible to their final users ( e.g. , overall reduction of bandwidth for service provisioning ) .",
    "our goal is to build on this insight and design a network - aware service placement algorithm that will improve the service quality and network performance by optimizing the usage of scarce resources in community networks such as bandwidth .",
    "[ sec : model ]",
    "the deployment and sharing of services in community networks is made available through _ community network micro - clouds _ ( cnmcs ) .",
    "the idea of cnmc is to place the cloud closer to community end - users , so users can have fast and reliable access to the service . to reach its full potential",
    ", a cnmc needs to be carefully deployed in order to utilize the available bandwidth resources .      in a cnmc",
    ", a server or low - power device is directly connected to the wireless base - station providing cloud services to users that are either within a reasonable distance or directly connected to base - station .",
    "these nodes are core - graph nodes what we call in guifi.net .",
    "it is important to remark that the services aimed in this work are at infrastructure level ( iaas ) , as cloud services in current dedicated datacenters ( we assume qmp nodes are core - graph nodes ) . therefore the services are deployed directly over the core resources of the network ( nodes in the core - graph ) and accessed by base - graph clients .",
    "services can be deployed by guifi.net users or administrators .",
    "the services we consider can be centralized or distributed .",
    "the distributed services can be composite services ( non - monolithic ) built from simpler parts , e.g. , video streaming .",
    "these parts or components of service would create an overlay and interact with each other to offer more complex services .",
    "a service may or may not be tied to a specific node of the network .",
    "each nodes can host one or more services .",
    "in this work we assume offline service placement approach where single or a set of application are placed `` in one shot '' in the underlying physical network .",
    "we might rearrange the placement of the same service over the time because of the service performance fluctuation ( e.g. weather conditions , node availability , changes in use pattern , and etc . ) .",
    "we do not consider real - time service migration .",
    "we call the community network the _ underlay _ to distinguish it from the _ overlay _ network which is built by the services .",
    "the underlay network is supposed to be connected and we assume each node knows whether other nodes can be reached ( i.e. , next hop is known ) .",
    "we can model the underlay graph as : @xmath1 where or is the set of outdoor routers present in the cns and @xmath2 is the set of wireless links that connects them .",
    "let @xmath3 be the bandwidth of the path to go from node @xmath4 to node @xmath5 .",
    "we want a partition of @xmath6 clusters : @xmath7 of the set of nodes in the mesh network .",
    "the cluster head @xmath4 of cluster @xmath8 is the location of the node where the service will be deployed.the partition maximizing the bandwidth from the cluster head to the other nodes in the cluster is given by : @xmath9    [ sec : algorithm ]      we designed a bandwidth - aware algorithm that allocated services taking into account the bandwidth of the network .",
    "we take a network snapshot ( capture ) from qmp network regarding the bandwidth of the links .",
    "our bandwidth - aware service placement algorithm basp ( see algorithm [ alg : basp ] ) runs in three phases .",
    "@xmath7 @xmath10    @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14    @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19    \\(i ) initially , we use the naive k - means partitioning algorithm in order to group nodes based on their geo - location .",
    "the idea is to get back clusters of locations that are close to each other .",
    "the k - means algorithm forms clusters of nodes based on the euclidean distances between them , where the distance metrics in our case are the geographical coordinates of the nodes . in traditional k - means algorithm ,",
    "first , @xmath6 out of @xmath20 nodes are randomly selected as the cluster heads ( centroids ) .",
    "each of the remaining nodes decides its cluster head nearest to it according to the euclidean distance .",
    "after each of the nodes in the network is assigned to one of @xmath6 clusters , the centroid of each cluster is re - calculated .",
    "grouping nodes based on geo - location is in line with how guifi.net is organized .",
    "the nodes in guifi.net are organized into a tree hierarchy of _ zones _ @xcite . a zone can represent nodes from a neighborhood or a city .",
    "each zone can be further divided in child zones that cover smaller geographical areas where nodes are close to each other .",
    "from the service perspective we consider placements inside a particular zone .",
    "\\(ii ) the second phase of the algorithm it is based on the concept of finding the cluster head maximizing the bandwidth between the head and member nodes of the cluster , formed in the first phase of the algorithm . the cluster heads computed in this phase are the ones having the maximum bandwidth to the other nodes in the cluster @xmath21 . the cluster heads are node candidates for service placement .",
    "\\(iii ) the third and last phase of the algorithm includes reassigning the nodes to the selected cluster heads having the maximum bandwidth .    regarding computational complexity",
    ", the naive brute force method can be estimated by calculating the _ stirling number of the second kind _",
    "@xcite which counts the number of ways to partition a set of @xmath20 elements into @xmath6 nonempty subsets , i.e. , @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "however , for basp , finding the optimal solution to the k - means clustering problem if @xmath6 and @xmath25 ( the dimension ) are fixed ( e.g. , in our case @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ) , the problem can be exactly solved in time @xmath28 , where n is the number of entities to be clustered .",
    "the complexity for computing the cluster heads in phase two is @xmath29 , and @xmath30 for the reassigning the clusters in phase three .",
    "therefore , the overall complexity of basp is @xmath31 , which is significantly smaller than the brute force method .    [",
    "sec : evaluation ]",
    "solving the problem stated in equation [ equ1 ] in brute force for any number of @xmath32 and @xmath6 is np - hard . for this reason we came out with our heuristic .",
    "initially we used k - means algorithm for a first selection of the clusters .",
    "then , we limit the choice of the cluster heads to be inside the sets of clusters obtained using k - means . inside these clusters",
    "we computed the cluster heads having the maximum bandwidth to the other nodes . to emphasise the importance of phase two and three , in this section we compare _ basp _ to _ naive k - means _ which partitions the nodes into @xmath6 groups such that the sum of squares from nodes to the assigned cluster heads ( centroids ) is minimized . at the minimum ,",
    "all cluster heads in _ naive k - means _ are at the mean of their voronoi sets ( the set of nodes which are nearest to the cluster heads ) .",
    "our experiment is comprised of 5 runs and the presented results are averaged over all the successful runs .",
    "each run consists of 15 repetitions .",
    "figure [ fig : bw_clusters ] depicts the average bandwidth to the cluster heads obtained with _",
    "naive k - means _ algorithm and our _ basp _ algorithm .",
    "figure reveals that for any number of @xmath6 , our _ basp _ algorithm outperforms the _ naive k - means _ algorithm .",
    "for k=2 the average bandwidth to the cluster head is increased from 18.3 mbps ( obtained with naive k - means ) to 27.7 mbps ( obtained with our basp algorithm ) i.e. , 40% increase .",
    "the biggest increase of 50% is when k=7 .",
    "based on the observations from the figure [ fig : bw_clusters ] , the gap between two algorithms is growing as @xmath6 increases .",
    "k increases as network grows .",
    "note that our heuristics enables us to select nodes ( cluster heads ) that provide much higher bandwidth then any other random or naive approach .",
    "but , if we were about to look for the optimum bandwidth within the clusters ( i.e. , optimum average bandwidth for the cluster ) , then this problem would end up to be an np - hard .",
    "finding the solution is np - hard , because finding the optimum entails running our algorithm for all the combinations of size @xmath6 from a set of size @xmath20 .",
    "this is a combinatorial problem that becomes intractable even for small sizes of @xmath6 or @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xmath33 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "for instance , if we would like to find the optimum bandwidth for a cluster of size k=3 , then the algorithm need to run for every possible ( non repeating ) combination of size 3 from the set of size 54 .",
    "that is for 54 nodes we would end up having  25k combinations ( @xmath34 ) , or 25k possible nodes to start with .",
    "we managed to do this and the optimum average bandwidth obtained was 62.7 mbps .",
    "the optimum bandwidth obtained for @xmath35 was 49.1 mbps , and for @xmath36 was 16.9 mbps .",
    "however the computation time took very long ( 65 hours for @xmath37 , 30 minutes for @xmath35 etc . ) , comparing to basp where it took 23 seconds for @xmath37 and 15 seconds for @xmath35 .",
    "table [ tab : centrality ] shows the basp improvement over naive k - means algorithm .",

    "<S> seamless computing and service sharing in community networks have been gaining momentum due to the emerging technology of community network micro - clouds ( cnmcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , running services in cnmcs can face enormous challenges such as the dynamic nature of micro - clouds , limited capacity of nodes and links , asymmetric quality of wireless links for services , deployment models based on geographic singularities rather than network qos , and etc . </S>",
    "<S> cnmcs have been increasingly used by network - intensive services that exchange significant amounts of data between the nodes on which they run , therefore the performance heavily relies on the available bandwidth resource in a network . </S>",
    "<S> this paper proposes a novel bandwidth - aware service placement algorithm which outperforms the current random placement adopted by guifi.net . </S>",
    "<S> our preliminary results show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms the current random placement adopted in guifi.net by 35% regarding its bandwidth gain . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , as the number of services increases , the gain tends to increase accordingly .    </S>",
