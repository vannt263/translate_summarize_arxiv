    "transient phenomena are manifestation of various classes of astrophysical sources .",
    "their study contributes to characterise the dynamics of such objects and gain clues on the physical processes responsible for their behaviour and evolution with time . in the current time domain era , most if not all transient sources are discovered and signal their transient character through the emission of one or multiple peaks in their flux time profile as a manifestation of enhanced activity . in high  energy astrophysics , for instance ,",
    "this is the case for black  hole candidates in binary systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , that of outbursting magnetars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or that of super fast x  ray transients ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    moving to most energetic and disruptive events on stellar scales , gamma",
    "ray bursts ( grbs ) are no exception .",
    "their gamma  ray time profiles , lasting from a fraction of a second all the way up to thousands seconds @xcite , are characterised by a variable number of pulses with no firm evidence for periodicity .",
    "such pulses often cluster within some emission episodes , separated by so ",
    "called quiescent times , during which the gamma  ray activity drops to the detector s background level . the so  called grb `` prompt '' , i.e. the gamma ",
    "ray emission itself , is still the least understood aspect of the grb phenomenon : e.g. , what is ( or are ) the gamma  ray emission mechanism(s ) , at what distance from the collapsing object , which kind of environment ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "one of the open issues concerns the stochastic ( or deterministic ? ) process which rules the time profile and its complicated multi  pulse structure @xcite .    to tackle this",
    ", one must develop an effective technique to detect as many peaks as possible in the observed light curves to a reliable degree , properly accounting for the statistical uncertainties affecting the time series .",
    "several authors in the grb literature faced this problem building on different techniques : @xcite ( hereafter , lf ) set up a simple but effective algorithm based on the poisson statistics affecting photon counting detectors .",
    "other authors made extensive use of lf algorithm @xcite to study the peak intensity as well as the distribution of waiting times , defined as the time intervals between adjacent pulses . in an alternative approach , @xcite set up a dedicated filter based on wavelets to suppress the statistical noise in grb time profiles and study the basic statistical properties of pulses as a consequence .",
    "more recently , @xcite studied the statistics of waiting times between emission episodes and precursor activity in grbs observed by several past and present experiments by adapting an algorithm originally developed for gravitational data analysis .",
    "this is based on a combined time ",
    "frequency decomposition of the time series variance .",
    "motivated by the peak detection problem in grb time series , in this paper we propose a new algorithm , called `` multiple excess peak search algorithm '' ( hereafter , mepsa ) , that is described in sect .",
    "[ sec : desc ] . as it will be shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : valid ] , compared with the previous lf algorithm and with a more conservative version of the same devised by us , mepsa is characterised by a lower rate of false positive and a higher rate of true positive events , particularly for low signal  to  noise ratio ( snr ) peaks .",
    "moreover , thanks to its high flexibility , mepsa can easily be adapted and tailored to different time series that are routinely obtained in many fields other than grbs , without having to modify the code itself .",
    "[ sec : appendix ] describes the output information provided by the code , which is made publicly available .",
    "mepsa searches the input light curves for peaks by applying simultaneously a multi  pattern set of excesses , i.e. a set of @xmath0 patterns .",
    "the input time series must have uniform sampling and must be affected by statistical uncorrelated gaussian noise .",
    "the series must be either background  subtracted , or removed of possible trends , so that changes in the expected value should only be due to signal and not to background .",
    "for each bin of the light curve , let @xmath1 the rates in the @xmath2-th bin .",
    "a given pattern @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) consists of a fixed number of adjacent bins around the given @xmath2-th bin : around @xmath2 there are a given @xmath5 leftward bins ( which temporally precede the @xmath2-th bin ) and @xmath6 rightward bins ( which temporally follow the @xmath2-th bin ) . the pattern assigns each of its bins , except for the @xmath2-th bin , a threshold @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) in terms of number of @xmath9 s ( where @xmath9 is the statistical noise corresponding to that bin ) .",
    "pattern @xmath3 is then said to be fulfilled by bin @xmath2 when the following conditions are simultaneously fulfilled : @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "each pattern has different numbers of leftward and rightward bins as well as different threshold values for each of them . for each bin @xmath2",
    "the search is performed by applying simultaneously a set of 39 different patterns ( @xmath12 ) and the @xmath2-bin is promoted to peak candidate if at least one pattern is fulfilled .",
    "the complete set of threshold values @xmath7 currently adopted is reported in table  [ tab : pattern ] .",
    "operatively , threshold values are not hard  coded , but are stored within an external file : this allows users to disable existing patterns / enable new ones in a very flexible way .",
    "when the entire light curve has been screened , the whole procedure is repeated to rebinned versions of the same curve , each time increasing the rebinning factor by one up to a maximum value @xmath13 established by the user . moreover , for a rebinning factor of @xmath14 ( integer ) of the original light curve , there are @xmath14 possible offsets : in fact , one can choose @xmath14 different starting bins and end up with as many different rebinned profiles . for for a given @xmath14 rebinning factor , all the corresponding rebinned curves are searched through the same algorithm .",
    "the goal behind this is to identify peaks with very different snr and/or very different timescales .",
    "the computational time scales as @xmath15 , so unreasonably high values should be avoided .",
    "clearly , most of the peaks are expected to be detected in multiple searches .",
    "so a final crosscheck is performed to make sure the same peak candidate is not going to be classified repeatedly as a number of distinct peak candidates .",
    "this is done by comparing the peak times together with the timescales associated with each peak time . finally ,",
    "when the same peak candidate is detected at different timescales , the algorithm selects the one with the ( statistically most significant ) highest value .",
    "this timescale is therefore defined as `` detection timescale '' and hereafter is denoted with @xmath16 .",
    "this automatically identifies the timescale at which the peak is detected at best ; as such , this can be taken as a reasonable proxy for the peak timescale itself .",
    "the set of values chosen for the pattern thresholds had been determined after analysing hundreds of grb profiles detected with _",
    "@xcite , _ bepposax_/grbm @xcite , and _",
    "swift_/bat @xcite . as such",
    ", they were tailored to the grb features themselves so as to ensure an acceptable trade - off between the rate of true negative and that of false positive detections . in this respect ,",
    "the algorithm in its current version ( october 2014 ) has proved to be conservative , as is shown in sect .",

    "[ fig : a_vs_r ] the violin plot of the normalised scatter , i.e. the difference between true and estimated values normalised by the estimated uncertainty , as a function of peak rate .",

    "there is no significant trend with peak rate : the variance of distribution remains essentially unchanged throughout the spanned range , and so does the mean value . in all cases",
    "the null value is within @xmath94 of the distribution .",
    "all mean values are above zero , suggestive of a small bias that tends to overestimates the peak rate , even though it is still within uncertainties .",
    "a possible explanation for that is that mepsa searches the peak through all the possible binnings and shifts , with the result of a slight bias towards positive statistical fluctuations .",
    "figure  [ fig : a_vs_r_lf ] shows the analogous violin plots for the normalised residuals for lfa and cfla , respectively , for the identified well separated pulses . in both cases , the accuracy is remarkably worse at low snr values , where peak rate estimates become crucially biased by statistical fluctuations that overestimate as much as up to @xmath95 .",
    "it is worth noting that in this respect clfa is even worse on average .    .",

    "both lfa and clfa provide significantly more biased estimates of the true peak rates than our algorithm does.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]      both mepsa and lfa algorithms do not assume any specific shape for the peaks .",
    "as non  parametric methods , they have the benefit of being applicable to a broad variety of time series characterised by peaks .",
    "the downside is that peak fwhm must be estimated from the data themselves and not through fitting parameters that are linked to specific peak models .",
    "lfa algorithms provide no direct information about peak width , the only bare proxy being the times of the two adjacent valleys surrounding a given peak .",
    "analogously , a detection timescale @xmath16 is associated to each mepsa peak ( sect .",
    "[ sec : desc ] ) . as in the case of lfa valleys ,",
    "the detection timescale is affected by the peak snr : at low snr values it tends to bin up the light curve as much as possible to reach the required statistical excess to trigger mepsa . on the other side , at high snr",
    "the peak already triggers some mepsa patterns at low timescales and at longer timescale , although the snr increases , the average peak rate estimate likely decreases .",
    "all this turns into favouring the short timescales at high snr and the other way around at low snr .",

    "[ sec : deltatbin ] , mepsa does not provide a direct estimate of the peak snr , to calculate which one should integrate over the entire pulse profile or , equivalently , over its fwhm and correct it by a given factor . as it was shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : deltatbin ] , mepsa can only roughly estimate the fwhm , and so does it for the snr , too .",
    "a snr proxy is yielded by the estimated snr , snr@xmath103 , which is calculated by mepsa over the detection time @xmath16 .",
    "we studied the relation between the estimated and true snr s for the sample of well separated simulated peaks and obtained that , regardless of the scatter , the relation can be approximately linearly described as , @xmath104 as displayed by figure  [ fig : snr ] .    ) peaks that have been identified by mepsa.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    practically , starting from the values obtained by mepsa for the snr@xmath103 and @xmath16 of a given peak , one could use eq .",

    "[ fig : eff_mepsa ] and estimate the efficiency  corrected rate of such peaks in the time series .",
    "we presented mepsa , multiple excess peak search algorithm , which searches for peaks by applying a mask of multi  excess patterns to an evenly spaced , background  subtracted ( or detrended ) time series , which is thought to be affected by statistical uncorrelated gaussian noise .",
    "this is often the case also for photon counting detectors operating in the high counting regime .",
    "we compared its performance against the popular and widely adopted lfa as well as with a slightly more conservative version of the same , under two complementary aspects : the false positive and the true positive rates . in either case mepsa",
    "is more reliable , showing a lower fp rate ( @xmath105  bin@xmath72 ) as well as a higher true positive one , especially at low snr ( @xmath106 45 ) .",
    "we showed that mepsa efficiency most crucially depends on the combination of separability , defined as the ratio between the lowest temporal separation from adjacent peaks and the fwhm of a given peak , and snr . at snr@xmath8345 ,",
    "efficiency significantly drops .",
    "this is also the case when adjacent peaks overlap non  negligibly , i.e. when separability drops below 1 , with little but significant dependence on snr , that we modelled with a double power  law in the separability  snr plane .",
    "mepsa also yields some proxies to characterise fwhm and snr of pulses and we described a quick way to do that .",
    "although the motivation originally sprang up from grb time profiles , its applicability extends to other similar fields of high  energy astrophysics as well as solar x  ray flares , and , more in general , whenever the applicability requirements on the input time series are fulfilled .",
    "the search algorithm is decoupled from the mask of multiple excesses being searched .",
    "this property makes it particularly flexible , so that users possibly interested in events other than grbs can quickly modify and optimise the mask of multiple excesses , disable existing patterns and/or enable new ones , once these have been tested through simulations or independent data sets .",
