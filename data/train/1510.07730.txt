    "the encke gap is a 320  km wide division in saturn s a ring centered at a planetary distance of 133,581  km .",
    "it is maintained by gravitational action of the embedded moon pan , which shape is approximated by an ellipsoid with axes @xmath0  km @xcite . in total , there are four ringlets found in this division , three of them are visible in fig  [ fig : enckegap ] .",
    "the central ringlet shares it s orbit with pan .",
    "there are two further ringlets fainter than the central ringlet , each about 100  km away from the center towards the inner and outer gap edge , which we call the inner and outer ringlets .",
    "another more diffusive ringlet is located between central and outer ringlet .",
    "the optical depths of central , inner , and outer encke ringlets vary significantly with azimuthal longitude .",
    "for instance , the clumps in the encke central ringlet are found to be concentrated in a region 060@xmath1 ahead the orbit of pan with slant optical depth @xmath2 ( @xcite , @xcite ; m. sremevi 2011 , private communication ; @xcite ) , while other parts of the ringlet are much fainter .",
    "@xcite suggested that the concentration results from a combination of plasma drag and the particle dynamics in the horseshoe region of pan .",
    "observations show strong forward light scattering , indicating that encke ringlets are composed of micron - sized particles @xcite .",
    "furthermore , based upon the strength of spectra feature , the so called ` christiansen effect ' , @xcite suggested that the fraction of particles with radius smaller than 10@xmath3 in encke ringlets is less than in f ring or the ringlet in laplace gap . later in section  [ sec : f_rad ] we show that the large eccentricities of small ( radii less than 2.4@xmath3 ) particles induced by solar radiation pressure can explain the lack of few micron particles .",
    "apart from the few - micron particles , the lifetimes of larger micron - sized particles ( radii between 2.4@xmath3 and 100@xmath3 ) are restricted by several processes .",
    "we will demonstrate that the lifetimes are about 30 years with putative embedded moonlets or about @xmath4 years ( for 10@xmath3 radius particles ) due to plasma sputtering .",
    "consequently , mechanisms must be at work to replenish these narrow dusty ringlets .",
    "our main purpose is to understand the origin and evolution of particles in the central ringlet . to this end",
    "we explore the hypothesis that pan , or putative , unseen moonlets in the horseshoe region of pan , act as dust sources of encke central ringlet .",
    "such a population of moonlets with size between tens to hundreds of meters would be below the detection limits of the cassini imaging science subsystem ( iss ; the resolution is @xmath51  km / pixel on the rings , @xcite ) .",
    "dust is released from pan and these moonlets through micrometeorite impacts ( the impact - ejecta process ) and/or in mutual collisions between the moonlets .",
    "these processes have been widely invoked to explain the dust formation in other contexts .",
    "for example , impact - ejecta process is used to explain the dust cloud around galilean moons @xcite , saturn s f ring @xcite and g ring arcs @xcite , while impact - ejecta together with moonlet mutual collisions is proposed to maintain rings of uranus and neptune @xcite .",
    "non - gravitational forces must be taken into account in the dynamics of micron - sized dust .",
    "important perturbations for a circumplanetary particle are solar radiation , planetary oblateness , and electromagnetic forces @xcite .",
    "furthermore , plasma drag should also play a role .",
    "an ionosphere mainly composed of @xmath6 and @xmath7 has been discovered around saturn s ring system @xcite .",
    "the interaction between ions and dust increase the semi - major axes of dust , probably explaining the observed semi - major axis distribution in encke central ringlet at certain range of co - rotating longitudes ( * ? ? ?",
    "21 ) .    in order to describe the generation , evolution , and sustainment of the encke central ringlet",
    ", we establish a kinetic model considering the ` birth ' , evolution , and ` death ' of dust in the encke central ringlet .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the kinetic equations are developed in section  [ sec : kinetics ] , with short summaries in section  [ sec : sum_dyn ] and [ sec : sum_kin ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , the results and discussions are presented .",
    "conclusions and outlook are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "assuming for simplicity , a narrow dusty ring with a homogeneous spatial distribution of the dust grain in a well defined region of the ringlet . then , the time evolution of the total number of particles @xmath8 in this ringlet is given by the kinetic balance @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the gain and loss rates caused by sources and sinks , respectively .",
    "assuming the ringlet reaches a quasi - steady state , @xmath12 and the total number of ringlet particles can be estimated as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the average particle lifetime dominated by the particle sinks and the dynamical life of particles ( i.e. , they may escape the ringlet ) .",
    "this equation can also be written in terms of ringlet geometric optical depth @xmath15 with the optical depth increase rate @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the averaged radius of the dust grains and @xmath18 is the total area of the ringlet .",
    "the value of @xmath19 is obtained by setting the semi - major axis to @xmath20 and assuming a ringlet @xmath21 , the latter is equal to the diameter of pan s hill sphere . in other words , for an estimate of the number of particles of a ringlet at steady - state , two crucial parameters must be quantified : the source rate @xmath22 and the mean particle lifetime @xmath14 , characterizing the particle sources and sinks .",
    "a similar model was established by @xcite for dense rings , where a kinetic balance between adhesion and collisional release of regolith like particles from the surface of parent bodies was considered .",
    "the model was used to explain the lower cut - off of particle size saturn s dense rings . here",
    "we follow a similar concept , considering a putative population of skyscraper - sized moonlets in the horseshoe region of pan acting as major dust source .",
    "an embedded moonlet belt in the encke central ringlet would act both as source and sink of dust .",
    "these moonlets , if they exist , would be gravitationally bound to the horseshoe or tadpole region of pan .",
    "their size must be in the range of tens to hundreds of meters in diameter , with upper limit smaller than the detection limit of cassini imaging science subsystem @xcite . as suggested by @xcite ,",
    "most structures in saturn s f ring are related to prometheus , pandora , and a population of embedded moonlets .",
    "the kinky and clumpy structures of the encke gap ringlets resemble the f ring structures , and thus may be in a similar result from the gravitational action of such embedded moonlets .    what is a reasonable guess of the population of these embedded sub - km moonlets ?",
    "@xcite have about 87 cassini vims occultation profiles of the encke ringlets , 24 of them have sufficient signal - to - noise ratio to assure the detection of the low optical depth ringlet .",
    "no ( infrared ) opaque objects have been identified in occultations .",
    "the typical fresnel zone for such an occultation is about 40 meters @xcite .",
    "therefore the total scanned area on the central ringlet is roughly @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is width of ringlet .",
    "this is about @xmath25 of the total ringlet area ( the @xmath26 mentioned above ) .",
    "imagine there are 100/10,000 occultation - detectable moonlets embedded in encke central ringlet , this means the chance to find at least one moonlet in these 87 occultations is about @xmath27/@xmath28 .",
    "therefore it is safe to say that there could have hundreds to thousands of sub - km moonlets .",
    "our assumption is : there are 100 moonlets with radius of 250 meters .",
    "this makes the total moonlet optical depth @xmath29 .",
    "although such assumption seemed to be over - simplified , as we shown in the following section , all we need is the cross section which acts as source and sink of dust for impact - ejecta process .",
    "this @xmath29 can also spread into a moonlet population with some steeper size distribution , this does not change the result of impact - ejecta process .",
    "next question is why we choose @xmath30 ?",
    "in fact , for impact - ejecta process , the source rate and sink rate are both proportional to the total moonlets cross section .",
    "so , as long as one do nt choose an extreme @xmath31 which makes other sources or sinks become important , the ringlet will reach same balance .",
    "schematically , the release of dust through the impact - ejecta process from pan or putative embedded moonlets in the encke central ringlet is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sources ] .",
    "the mass production rate @xcite can be parameterized in the form @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the mass flux of projectiles dominated by interplanetary dust particles ( idps ) , we adopt a fiducial value of @xmath34 ( explain later ) ; the ejecta yield @xmath35 is the ratio of ejected mass to the mass of the projectile , and @xmath36 is the cross section of the targets . the yield is obtained base on the experiments and assume a pure icy surface @xcite .",
    "note that the both @xmath33 and yield are highly uncertain .",
    "for example , if there are 10% of silicate on the surface of target moons , the yield decrease to about 2/3 of this value .    at saturn",
    "s heliocentric distance , the mass flux of idps ( @xmath37 ) is not yet well determined by observations .",
    "the infinity sign ( @xmath38 ) indicates this flux is far from saturn and is not influenced by saturn s gravity , while the @xmath33 in eq .",
    "is the flux enhanced by gravitational focusing of saturn .",
    "the gravitational focusing is a function of radial distance to saturn @xcite .",
    "since the flux is not yet well determined , we simply use @xmath39 as fiducial number , same as previous studies @xcite which is based on model by @xcite .",
    "after consider the gravitational focusing @xcite , we obtain @xmath34 in the orbital range of encke gap . note that this impactor flux is likely overestimated and has order(s ) of magnitude uncertainties .",
    "the reason is that , base on the impactor flux above , there should have dust cloud near rhea .",
    "but optical observations by cassini iss @xcite and measurements of cosmic dust analyzer ( cda ) onboard cassini @xcite both can not detect dust cloud or ring near rhea .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that the impactor flux is not stationary , but is varying with time . for example",
    ", @xmath33 should be increased while the saturn system is passing through meteor swarms , same mechanisms for the meteor showers observed on earth regularly .",
    "if the ejecta size - distribution is approximated by a power law , then the total production rate of ejecta larger than radius @xmath40 is given by @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the maximum radius and mass of the ejecta .",
    "following again the work by @xcite we take @xmath44 and @xmath45 with density @xmath46 , a size that is believed to represent the peak mass flux of the projectiles , and @xmath47 denotes the slope of the cumulative size distribution .    by assuming the distribution of particle size between @xmath40 and @xmath42 are same in the ringlet as in the ejecta , the effective radius of particle @xmath17 which weighted by the average cross section is @xmath48^{1/2 } \\ , , \\gamma \\neq 2\\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the minimum particle radius . in the encke gap ,",
    "particles smaller than 2.4@xmath3 have very short lifetimes so that they practically do not contribute to the particle population in the central encke ringlet .",
    "this is because they rapidly develop large eccentricities by the action of solar radiation pressure and are lost to the a ring ( see section  [ sec : f_rad ] for details ) .",
    "therefore we use @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath47 in equation ( [ eq : s_avg ] ) , which results in @xmath52 .",
    "not all of the freshly produced ejecta contribute to the ringlet because their initial speed may not be sufficient to overcome the gravity of their parent body .",
    "especially for pan a fraction of ejecta simply fall back to the satellite . to quantify this effect",
    "we describe the initial speed distribution by a power law @xcite @xmath53 with the normalization @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the heaviside step function and @xmath56 the minimum ejecta speed .",
    "plausible values for the slope of the speed distribution @xmath57 should lie between 2 and 3 . here",
    "@xmath58 would be expected for regolith targets and a larger number @xmath59 is for solid surfaces .",
    "the minimum ejecta speed @xmath56 is constrained by the fraction of the projectile s kinetic energy @xmath60 that is converted into the ejecta s kinetic energy @xmath61 .",
    "we use the relationship between the ratio @xmath62 , yields @xmath63 , minimum ejecta speed @xmath56 and slope @xmath57 given by @xcite @xmath64                            \\quad \\text{for } \\zeta \\neq 3\\ ] ] or @xmath65 where we assume a maximum ejecta speed @xmath66 @xcite . in experiments",
    "@xcite the ratio @xmath62 is found in the range between a few percent to several tens of percent .",
    "it is larger when the projectile speed is high or the target surface is hard @xcite . in the encke gap",
    ", the impactor speed @xmath67 is relatively high ( @xmath68 , due to gravitational focusing of saturn ) and the target surfaces are probably regolith - like . hence we adopt a moderate value @xmath69 . using this value together with @xmath70 ( for regolith surfaces ) and @xmath35",
    ", we obtain @xmath71 from eq .  .",
    "because of the power law distribution of initial speeds , most of the particles are ejected with speeds only marginally larger than @xmath56 .",
    "the ejecta speed of 1@xmath72 is larger than the escape velocity of sub - km moonlets , but smaller than that of pan .",
    "three body effects can be incorporated in an approximate manner , resulting in the expression for the escape velocity @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the radius and mass of the moon , @xmath76{m/(3m_s+m)}$ ] is the hill radius of the moon and @xmath77 the radial distance to saturn .",
    "the moonlet mass is calculated by assuming a moonlet density of 410 kg / m@xmath78 , as was estimated for pan @xcite .",
    "therefore , for pan and a 250-meter - radius moonlet in the encke gap , the escape velocities are about 3.6  m / s and 0.06  m / s , respectively .",
    "the fraction of escaping ejecta is related to the escape velocity @xmath79 and the initial speed distribution of ejecta @xcite @xmath80 therefore , only some ( @xmath528% ) ejecta from pan can escape , while all ejecta from 250 meter moonlets can escape .",
    "for this simple estimate we ignored the non - spherical shape of pan and the detailed three body dynamics in the hill sphere , which cause the escape velocity to vary with the launching position of ejecta @xcite .    as shown above , dust produced by impact - ejecta can not all escape pan .",
    "furthermore , for those escape pan , it is still unlikely that they can contribute to the encke central ringlet because they are gravitationally scattered by pan .",
    "we use @xmath81 to represent the fraction of escaped ejecta from pan that enter the ringlet , which should a be very small number and is quantified to be 0.125% in section  [ sec : res_pan ] . on the other hand , ejecta escape from smaller moonlets are already in horseshoe orbit of pan and the gravity of these less massive moonlets is not important , therefore we assume all ejecta from moonlets contribute to the ringlet .",
    "putting all the parameters into equations   , we obtain the rates for dust production @xmath82 , dust escape @xmath83 , and optical depth increase @xmath84 , and all summarized in table  [ tbl : n_plus ] . here",
    "we used @xmath85 612 km@xmath86 for the cross section of pan and @xmath85 20 km@xmath86 for the moonlet belt . since the value of @xmath81 must be very small and we do not see another mechanisms to transport these scattered particles back to the ringlet",
    ", we conclude that pan can not be the major source of encke central ringlet .",
    ".dust production rates due to the impact - ejecta process in the encke central ringlet .",
    "the putative moonlets have a total cross section @xmath87 of 20@xmath88 , or optical depth of @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath82 is the dust production rate ; @xmath83 is the rate that dust escaping the source moon ; @xmath84 is the optical depth increase rate .",
    "the factor @xmath81 describes the fraction of ejecta from pan that can contribute to the ringlet ( i.e. , particles remaining in horseshoe region ) , it s value is roughly estimated to be about 0.125% ( see section [ sec : res_pan ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the particle dynamics can explain the minimum particle size and the azimuthal asymmetry in encke central ringlet .",
    "the solar radiation pressure indicates that particle radius must be larger than 2.4@xmath3 to avoid collision with the gap edges .",
    "the plasma drag causes the semi - major axes of ringlet particles of 1100@xmath3 increase by 100.1 km / year , and the uncertainties on ion densities may increase the number by a factor of 10100 .",
    "@xcite proposed that the outward migration and the resulting azimuthal asymmetry of encke central ringlet particles is caused by the combination of gravity of saturn , pan , and drag force ( especially the plasma direct collision ) . here",
    "we further consider the coulomb plasma drag and use simulation to demonstrate the azimuthal asymmetry as the result of ` modified horseshoe orbit ' .",
    "furthermore , we also shown that when the plasma drag is strong enough , the particle source is restricted to a small region of longitudes since particles generated from another region of the ringlet can not survive for very long time  they are pushed outside the horseshoe orbits .",
    "this implies one might deduce the strength of the plasma drag from the cassini observations by studying the azimuthal asymmetry of the encke central ringlet .    in future work , we would like to further investigate the ring kinetics .",
    "a generalized concept of ring kinetics describes the balance of the counteracting processes of coagulation and fragmentation @xcite .",
    "@xcite have applied this concept to a case of bimodal size distribution ( ` carriers ' and ` dust ' ) of ring particles , in order to explain the lack of sub - centimeter particles in dense planetary rings .",
    "however , this simplified model had not considered the shearing forces during lateral collisions and the direct actions by colliding carrier , both should increase the efficiency on releasing particles .",
    "we thank to miodrag sremevi for the observation on the azimuthal variation in the encke central ringlet . also thank for thomas mnch for the calculation in equilibrium potential .",
