    "matter - wave gap solitons ( gss ) are localized modes that can be created in elongated bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) loaded into one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical - lattice ( ol ) potentials , with the intrinsic nonlinearity induced by repulsive interactions between atoms .",
    "gss have been the topic of a large number of original works .",
    "results produced by these studies were summarized in several reviews @xcite . within the framework of the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the description of matter - wave patterns is based on the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for the macroscopic wave function @xmath0 @xcite:@xmath1 which has proven to be very successful in reproducing experimental results for the zero - temperature bec ( for instance , for multiple vortices , as shown in detail in refs .",

    "furthermore , @xmath7 is the radial - confinement potential and @xmath8 is the axial potential , which may include the axial harmonic trap and the 1d ol , with depth @xmath9 and period @xmath10 : @xmath11 the energy scale in the underlying ( no - interaction ) linear problem is set by the ol s recoil energy , @xmath12 .    most commonly , theoretical studies of gss in elongated geometries are carried out in terms of the 1d gpe @xcite:@xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "this is an effective evolution equation for the axial dynamics described by the 1d wave function @xmath15 which can be derived from the full three - dimensional ( 3d ) gpe after averaging out the radial degrees of freedom under the assumption that the radial confinement is so tight that the transverse dynamics are frozen to zero - point oscillations .",
    "these conditions , however , are not easy to realize using typical experimental parameters @xcite , and when such conditions are not met the transverse excitations can no longer be neglected , making an essentially 3d analysis necessary . in this work , we aim to investigate different physically relevant regimes and capture 3d effects in the generation and stability of matter - wave gss in elongated becs",
    ". this analysis should make it possible to determine the range of validity of the 1d gpe for the description of the gss under typical experimental conditions , as well as characteristic features of the fundamental and higher - order gss in realistic situations .    in principle , when the transverse excitations are relevant , eq .",
    "( [ ii-0c ] ) fails and one has to resort to the full 3d gpe ( [ ii-0a ] ) , as recently done in ref .",
    "@xcite , or , alternatively , use extended 1d models that , within the framework of certain assumptions , take into account effects of higher - order radial modes on the axial dynamics of the condensate , leading to effective 1d equations with the cubic - quintic @xcite or nonpolynomial @xcite nonlinearities . in this work , we will consider both the full 3d gpe and the effective 1d model with a nonpolynomial nonlinearity , which was derived , for the case of the self - repulsive nonlinearity , in ref .",

    "we will demonstrate that , while the range of applicability of the 1d gpe ( [ ii-0c ] ) is severely limited in realistic situations , the above - mentioned generalization gives a good description of stationary matter - wave gss in virtually all cases of practical interest .",

    "the model is formulated in section ii , where we also recapitulate the derivation of the effective nonpolynomial 1d equation following the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , as this derivation is essential for the presentation of the results for the gss .",
    "the main findings are collected in sections iii , where families of gs solutions are reported in several physically relevant regimes for strong , intermediate , and weak transverse confinement and shallow or deep ol potential .",
    "both fundamental gss and their multipeak bound states are considered .",
    "only in the case of tight confinement combined with a shallow ol does the ordinary 1d gpe provide for a sufficiently accurate description of the gss in comparison with results of full 3d computations . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective nonpolynomial 1d equation provides for good accuracy in all cases ; for the fundamental solitons and their bound states alike .",
    "the stability of the gss is studied in section iv by means of systematic simulations of the evolution of perturbed solitons .",
    "the conclusion is that the fundamental gss are stable ( except in a narrow region close to the upper edge of the band gaps ) , even in the case of strong deviation from the usual 1d description .",
    "multisoliton bound states are stable if the ol potential is deep enough .",
    "conclusions following from results of this work , including applicability limits for the mean - field approximation and 1d approximations , are formulated in section v.",
    "the model that was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for a bec in the absence of ol potentials resorted to the adiabatic approximation , to neglect correlations between the transverse and axial motions .",
    "this approximation assumes that the axial density varies slowly enough to allow the transverse wave function to follow these slow variations . because the ol imposes a new spatial scale , which may be more restrictive , it is necessary to find out if the adiabatic approximation remains valid in the presence of the ol . to this end , we will now briefly recapitulate the derivation of the effective 1d equation based on this approximation .",

    "thus , eq . ( [ ii-13 ] ) incorporates an energy shift @xmath41 , which is irrelevant for the dynamics but simplifies the form of the equation and makes the global chemical potential that follows from this effective 1d equation exactly coinciding with the corresponding 3d result .",
