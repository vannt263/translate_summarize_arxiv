    "let @xmath22 be the probability mass function ( pmf ) or probability density function ( pdf ) ( as the case may be ) of @xmath21 .",
    "the asymptotic equipartition property ( aep ) for @xmath18 is the assertion that @xmath23 either in probability or with probability one as @xmath2 goes to @xmath24 .",

    "however , in the non - asymptotic regime where one wants to establish non - asymptotic coding results for finite block length @xmath2 , the aep in its current form can not be applied in general . in this paper",
    ", we aim to establish the non - asymptotic counterpart of the aep , which is broadly referred to as the non - asymptotic equipartition property ( nep ) , so that the nep can be applied to finite block length @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , with respect to @xmath1 , we first characterize , for any finite block length @xmath2 , how close @xmath5 is to @xmath1 by determining the information spectrum of @xmath4 , i.e. , the distribution of @xmath5 ; such a property is referred to as the nep with respect to @xmath1 . for any iid source pair @xmath30 with finite conditional entropy @xmath31 and mutual information @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the shannon conditional entropy of @xmath21 given @xmath34 if @xmath18 is discrete , and the conditional differential entropy of @xmath21 given @xmath34 if @xmath18 is continuous , we then examine , for any finite block length @xmath2 , how close @xmath35 ( @xmath36 , respectively ) is to @xmath33 ( @xmath32 , respectively ) by determining the distribution of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 , respectively ) , where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , respectively ) is the conditional pmf or pdf ( as the case may be ) of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , respectively ) given @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , respectively ) ; these properties are referred to as the nep with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath43 , respectively .    in the same way",
    "as the aep plays an important role in establishing the asymptotic coding ( including source , channel , and multi - user coding ) results in information theory , our established nep is also instrumental to the development of non - asymptotic source and channel coding results . using the nep with respect to @xmath1",
    ", we further establish a non - asymptotic fixed rate source coding theorem , which reveals , for any finite block length @xmath2 , a complete picture about the tradeoff between the minimum rate of fixed rate coding of @xmath6 and error probability when the error probability is a constant , or goes to @xmath7 with block length @xmath2 at a sub - polynomial @xmath8 , @xmath44 , polynomial @xmath8 , @xmath10 , or sub - exponential @xmath11 , @xmath12 , speed .",
    "in particular , it is shown that for any finite block length @xmath2 , the minimum rate ( in nats per symbol ) of fixed rate coding of @xmath13 with error probability @xmath14 is @xmath45 , where @xmath16 and @xmath46 ^ 2 - h^2 ( x ) $ ] is the information variance of @xmath18 . in a separate paper @xcite ,",
    "non - asymptotic channel coding theorems of similar nature will be established with the help of the nep with respect to other information quantities ; in particular , it is shown @xcite that for any binary input memoryless channel with uniform capacity achieving input @xmath18 , random linear codes of block length @xmath2 can reach within @xmath47 of the channel capacity while maintaining word error probability @xmath14 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 ^ 2 - h^2 ( x |y ) $ ] is the conditional information variance of @xmath18 given @xmath50 with @xmath50 being the output of the channel in response to the input @xmath18 .",
