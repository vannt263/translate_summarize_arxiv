    "most of the difficulty of quantum many - body physics stems from the complexity of its fundamental mathematical objects : many - body wavefunctions and density matrices . in the simplest case , where we have @xmath0 qubits , a wavefunction ( pure state )",
    "can be considered as a function mapping @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is characterized by @xmath2 complex parameters .",
    "density matrices ( mixed states ) have even greater mathematical complexity , mapping @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 complex parameters .",
    "the aim of this work is to describe a pictorial representation of quantum many - body wavefunctions , in which a wavefunction characterizing a chain of @xmath0 qubits maps into an image with @xmath5 pixels .",
    "thus , an increase in the number of qubits reflects itself in an increase in the resolution of the image .",
    "these images are typically fractal , and sometimes self - similar .",
    "extension to higher spin _ qudits _",
    "is straightforward , and is also explored . some physical properties of the wavefunction become visually apprehensible : magnetization ( ferro or antiferromagnetic character ) , criticality , entanglement , translation invariance , permutation invariance , etc .",
    "visualization of complex data is a common problem in many branches of science and technology .",
    "let us review here some of the relevant hallmarks that preceded our work .",
    "historically , it can be argued that the single most relevant advance in calculus was the discovery of the relation between algebraic functions and curves in the plane in the xvii century .",
    "function visualization provided an insight which guided most of the subsequent development of calculus , not only by helping solve established problems , but also by suggesting new ones . with the advent of the new information technologies",
    ", complex data visualization has developed into a full - fledged field of research .",
    "the reader is directed to @xcite for a recent review of state - of - the - art techniques , and @xcite for a historical perspective .    as a relevant example , the problem of visualization of dna and protein sequences was addressed in 1990 by jeffrey making use of the so - called _ chaos game representation _ ( cgr ) @xcite .",
    "dna sequences are long , highly correlated strings of four symbols , @xmath6 .",
    "let us label the four corners of a square with them .",
    "now , select the central point of the square and proceed as follows .",
    "pick the next symbol from the string .",
    "find the point midway between the selected point and the corner which corresponds to the symbol .",
    "mark that point , and make it your new selected point .",
    "if the sequence is genuinely random , the points will cover the square uniformly .",
    "otherwise , patterns will emerge , very often with fractal structure .",
    "the original purpose of the technique was mere visualization , but it evolved @xcite to provide quantitative measurements , such as shannon entropies , which help researchers to characterize dna and protein sequences @xcite .    in 2000 ,",
    "hao and coworkers @xcite developed a different representation technique for long dna sequences that also had fractal properties . given a certain value of @xmath0 , they computed the frequency of every subsequence of length @xmath0 within the global sequence , thus obtaining a mathematical object which is similar to a many - body wavefunction , only mapping from @xmath7 .",
    "the number of different subsequences of length @xmath0 is @xmath8 .",
    "hao and coworkers represented the subsequence probability distribution by dividing a unit square in a recursive way , into @xmath8 small squares , and attaching a color to each of them .",
    "the resulting images have fractal appearance , as remarked by the authors , but their quantification is not pursued .",
    "their purpose is to identify which types of subsequences are under - represented , and to this end they analyse the corresponding patterns of low frequency .    in 2005",
    "latorre @xcite , unaware of the work of hao et al . , developed independently a mapping between bitmap images and many - body wavefunctions which has a similar philosophy , and applied quantum information techniques in order to develop an image compression algorithm .",
    "although the compression rate was not competitive with standard _",
    ", the insight provided by the mapping was of high value @xcite . a crucial insight for the present work was the idea that latorre s mapping might be inverted , in order to obtain bitmap images out of many - body wavefunctions .",
    "focusing on quantum mechanics , the simplest visualization technique is provided by the representation of a qubit as a point on a bloch sphere .",
    "early work of ettore majorana @xcite proved that a permutation - invariant system of @xmath0 spins-1/2 can be represented as a set of @xmath9 points on the bloch sphere .",
    "this majorana representation has proved very useful in characterizations of entanglement @xcite .    a different approach that can provide visualization schemes of quantum many - body systems was introduced by wootters and coworkers in 2004 @xcite .",
    "the idea is to set a bidimensional array of operators which fulfill certain properties , and measure their expectation values in the given state .",
    "those values , displayed in a 2d lattice , generate a discrete analogue of a wigner function .      in this work ,",
    "we describe a set of techniques which provide graphical representations of many - body wavefunctions , which share many features with the schemes of latorre and hao and coworkers .",
    "the main insight is that the increase in complexity as we add more qubits is mapped into an increase in the resolution of the corresponding image .",
    "thus , the thermodynamic limit , when the number of qubits tends to infinity , corresponds to the continuum limit for the images .",
    "the scheme is recursive in scales , and this makes the images look fractal in a natural way .",
    "in fact , as we will discuss , exact self - similarity of the image implies that the wavefunction is factorizable .    in section [ 2dplots ]",
    "we describe the basic wavefunction plotting scheme , while section [ examples ] is devoted to providing several examples ( heisenberg , itf , dicke states , product states , etc . ) emphasizing how physical features map into plot features .",
    "the procedure is generalized in section [ otherplots ] , and some alternative plotting schemes are described , which allow us to try states of spin-1 systems , such as the aklt state .",
    "section [ selfsim ] , on the other hand , deals with the fractal properties of the plots and extracts useful information from them . in section [ entanglement ] discusses how to recognize entangled states in a wavefunction plot , along with a simple technique to estimate entanglement by inspection .",
    "a different plotting scheme , based upon the frame representation and related to the wootters group approach is succintly described in section [ pauli ] , and a few pictures are provided for the sake of comparison .",
    "the article finishes with conclusions and a description of future work .",
    "let us consider a couple of qubits .",
    "the tensor basis is composed of four states : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "consider also a unit square , @xmath14\\times[0,1]$ ] , and divide it into four `` level-1 '' squares .",
    "we can associate each of the basis states to one of the squares , as shown in figure [ fig.2dplot ] ( top ) .",

    ", as it is shown in figure [ fig.2dplot ] ( bottom ) . for a wavefunction with @xmath0 qubits , we will have to descend down to level-@xmath16 squares .",
    "each of them will correspond to one of the tensor basis states .",
    "if the number of qubits @xmath0 is odd , the same scheme can be applied with a rectangular plot .",
    "the last step is straightforward : attach a color , or a gray level , to each of the level-@xmath16 squares , depending on the value of the wavefunction . obviously , using only levels of gray ( or color intensity )",

    "unless otherwise stated , each cell is filled with a color corresponding with its wave - function amplitude according to the following scheme : color intensity corresponds to the modulus ( white means zero ) , and hue is used as a phase indicator .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     on the other hand , taking the half - filling dicke states of figure [ fig.dicke ] , it is evident that , at every magnification level , the number of different subimages increases by two .",

    "this bound is found to be fulfilled by the numerical calculations shown in figure [ fig.entropy.dicke ] .",
    "the reason for the difference between the estimate and the actual values of entanglement in fig .",
    "[ fig.entropy.dicke ] is twofold .",
    "first , the number of different level-@xmath38 quadrants is , in general terms , a very poor way to estimate the dimension of the subspace spanned by them .",
    "second , the value estimated this way is just the schmidt rank , whose logarithm is just an upper bound to the actual entanglement entropy .",
    "both problems can be handled within the more comprehensive framework , described in the next section .      given a wavefunction plot and a level @xmath39 ,",
    "let us divide the full region into a grid of @xmath40 sub - plot .",
    "moreover , let @xmath41 be an index running through all such sub - plots and @xmath42 be the actual image displayed in it , as in equation [ final.image ] .",
    "now we define a _ cross - correlation matrix _ for the plot image , @xmath43 , as    @xmath44    this cross - correlation matrix bears full information about entanglement of the first @xmath45 qubits within the wavefunction , as we proceed now to show .    according to equation [ final.image ] , the image on quadrant @xmath41",
    "is given by a linear combination of the right - states .",
    "using the orthogonality property assumed for them we obtain    @xmath46    thus , we recognize that @xmath43 is just the _ density matrix for the left part_. in other terms :    @xmath47    therefore , _ the cross - correlation matrix of the wavefunction plot holds full information related to entanglement_.    for example , for a product state , all subimages are equivalent modulo normalization .",
    "thus , we can assume that    @xmath48    with @xmath49 is the norm for each subimage .",
    "obviously , @xmath50 and , thus , the matrix @xmath51 is just a projector on a line .",
    "its spectrum is , in decreasing order , @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , its entanglement entropy is zero .",
    "in this last section we describe a rather different approach to the problem of providing a graphical representation of a quantum many - body system , but still self - similar by design . instead of plotting wavefunction amplitudes , or probabilities , we can plot the expectation values of a bidimensional array of operators , chosen in such a way that the full information contained in the wavefunction is preserved .",
    "this is called a _ frame representation _ of the quantum state @xcite . according to wootters and coworkers @xcite",
    ", the final representation may correspond to a discrete analogue of a _ wigner function _",
    "@xcite , with very interesting properties in order to characterize _ non - classicality _ , such as its _ negativity _ @xcite .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath9 qubits , described by a certain density matrix @xmath53 .",
    "now , let us consider the unit square @xmath14 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] and any two numbers , @xmath41 and @xmath29 , characterized by their binary expansion : @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",

    "self - similarity , therefore , is rooted in the plotting scheme , as in the previous case .    as an example , we provide in figure [ fig.pauliitf ] images illustrating the itf quantum phase transition : above , @xmath90 is small and only correlations in the @xmath86-axis are relevant .",
    "below , @xmath90 is large and correlations appear only in the @xmath91-axis .",
    "the middle panel shows the critical case .",
    "in this work we have described a family of schemes which allow visualization of the information contained in quantum many - body wavefunctions , focusing on systems of many qubits .",
    "the schemes are self - similar by design : addition of new qubits results in a higher resolution of the plots .",
    "the thermodynamic limit , therefore , corresponds to the continuum limit .",
    "the philosophy behind the schemes is to start out with a region @xmath92 and divide it into several congruent subdomains , all of them similar to @xmath92 .",
    "this subdivision procedure can be iterated as many times as needed , producing an exponentially large amount of subdomains , each of them characterized by a geometrical index .",
    "this index can be now associated to an element of the tensor - basis of the hilbert space , and its corresponding wavefunction amplitude goes , through a certain color code , into that subdomain .",
    "the most simple example is with @xmath92 a square which splits into four equal quadrants , but we can also start with a right triangle , or even with a line segment .    physical features of the wavefunctions translate naturally into visual features of the plot . for example , within the scheme in section [ 2dplots ] , the spin - liquid character of the ground state of the heisenberg model shows itself in a characteristic pattern of diagonal lines .",
    "this pattern is able to distinguish between open and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "other features which show up in the plots is magnetization , criticality , invariance under translations or permutation of the qubits , and marshall s sign rule .",
    "we have analysed the characteristic features of product states , the ground states of the ising model in a transverse field , the majumdar - ghosh hamiltonian or dicke states .",
    "we have also studied spin-1 systems , such as the aklt state .",
    "a very relevant physical feature which becomes apparent in the plots is entanglement .",
    "factorizability is straightforward to spot : a wavefunction is factorizable if all sub - images at a certain division level are equal , modulo normalization .",
    "the schmidt rank of a given left - right partition of the system is related to the dimension of the subspace spanned by all sub - images within the corresponding subdivision of the plot and , so , a crude method to obtain an upper bound is to count the number of different sub - images .",
    "the full information about entanglement is contained in the matrix that we have termed as cross - correlation , which contains the overlap between all subimages at a certain division level .    in a very different spirit",
    ", we have illustrated the frame representations of quantum states of many qubits .",
    "this approach is related to wooters group ideas . in it ,",
    "the expectation values of a selected set of operators are shown in a 2d array , which is again displayed in a self - similar manner .    in this work",
    "we have taken the first steps in the exploration of an alternative strategy in the study of quantum many - body sytems , which can provide support to the corpus of methods in the field .",
    "regarding further work , we would like to stress the further exploration of interesting quantum many - body states which we have not done here , for example the ground states of fermionic hamiltonians , the hubbard model , the mott transition or the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "understanding the plotting structure of matrix product states of low dimension might also result profitable .",
    "moreover , the mathematical properties of the mapping itself are worth studying by themselves .    as a final remark",
