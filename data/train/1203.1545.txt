    "galaxy clustering as measured in redshift - space contains the imprint of the linear growth rate of structure @xmath5 , in the form of a measurable large - scale anisotropy @xcite .",
    "this is produced by the coherent peculiar velocity flows towards overdensities , which add an angle - dependent contribution to the measured redshift . in linear theory , these _ redshift - space distortions _",
    "( rsd ) in the clustering pattern can be quantified in terms of the ratio @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the linear bias of the sample of galaxies considered ) .",
    "a value for @xmath4 can be obtained by modeling the anisotropy of the redshift - space two - point correlation function @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the separations perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight ) or , equivalently , of the power spectrum ( see @xcite for a review ) . since @xmath7 can be defined as the ratio of the _ rms _ galaxy clustering amplitude to that of the underlying matter , @xmath11 , the measured product @xmath12 is equivalent to the predicted combination @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the latter is a prediction depending on the gravity theory , once normalized to the amplitude of matter fluctuations at the given epoch , e.g. using cmb measurements .",
    "measurements of the growth rate @xmath5 are crucial to pinpoint the origin of cosmic acceleration , distinguishing whether it requires the addition of `` dark energy '' in the cosmic budget , or rather a modification of general relativity .",
    "these two radically alternative scenarios are degenerate when considering the expansion rate @xmath14 alone , as yielded , e.g. , by the hubble diagram of type ia supernova ( e.g. @xcite ) or baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao , e.g @xcite ) .",
    "although the rsd effect is well known since long , its important potential in the context of dark energy studies has been fully appreciated only recently @xcite .",
    "this led to a true renaissance of interest in this technique @xcite , such that rsd have quickly become one of the most promising probes for future large dark energy surveys .",
    "this is the case of the recently approved esa euclid mission @xcite , which is expected to reach statistical errors of a few percent on measurements of @xmath5 in several redshift bins out to @xmath15 using this technique ( coupled to similar precisions with the complementary weak - lensing experiment ) .    in general , forecasts of the statistical precision reachable by future projects on the measurements of different cosmological parameters have been produced through widespread application of the so - called fisher information matrix technique @xcite .",
    "this has also been done specifically for rsd estimates of the growth rate and related quantities @xcite .",
    "one limitation of these forecasts is that they necessarily imply some idealized assumptions ( e.g. on the gaussian nature of errors ) and have not been verified , in general , against systematic numerical tests .",
    "this is not easily doable in general , given the large size of planned surveys .",
    "a first attempt to produce general forecasts based on numerical experiments was presented by @xcite , who used mock surveys built from the millennium simulation @xcite to numerically estimate the random and systematic errors affecting their measurement of the growth rate from the vimos vlt deep survey . using a grid of reference survey configurations , they calibrated an approximated scaling relation for the relative error on @xmath4 as a function of survey volume and mean density .",
    "the range of parameters explored in this case was however limited , and one specific class of galaxies only ( i.e. bias ) was analyzed .",
    "the second crucial aspect to be taken into consideration when evaluating fisher matrix predictions , is that they only consider statistical errors and can not say anything about the importance of systematic effects , i.e. on the _ accuracy _ of the expected estimates .",
    "this is clearly a key issue for projects aiming at percent or sub - percent precisions , for which systematic errors will be the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "in fact , a number of works in recent years suggest that the standard linear kaiser description of rsd is not sufficiently accurate on quasi - linear scales ( @xmath16 ) where it is routinely applied ( @xcite ) .",
    "various non - linear corrections are proposed in these papers , the difficulty often being their practical implementation in the analysis of real data , in particular in configuration space @xcite .",
    "one may hope that in the future , with surveys covering much larger volumes , it will be possible to limit the analysis to very large scales , where the simple linear description should be adequate .",
    "still , ongoing surveys like wigglez @xcite , boss @xcite and vipers ( guzzo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , will still need to rely on the clustering signal at intermediate scales to model rsd .    here",
    ", we shall address in a more systematic and extended way the impact of random and systematic errors on growth rate measurements using rsd in future surveys .",
    "we shall compare the results directly to fisher matrix predictions , thoroughly exploring the dependence of statistical errors on the survey parameters , including also , in addition to volume and density , the bias parameter of the galaxies used .",
    "this is also relevant , as one could wonder which kind of objects would be best suited to measure rsd in a future project .",
    "these will include using halos of different mass ( i.e. bias ) , up to those traced by groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "potentially , using groups and clusters to measure rsd could be particularly interesting in view of massive galaxy redshift surveys as that expected from euclid @xcite , which can be used to build large catalogues of optically - selected clusters with measured redshifts . a similar opportunity will be offered by future x - ray surveys , such as those expected from the e - rosita mission @xcite , although in that case , mean cluster redshifts will have to be measured first .",
    "this paper is complementary to the parallel work of @xcite , where we investigate the impact on rds of redshift errors and explore how to disentangle geometrical distortions introduced by the uncertainty of the underlying geometry of the universe ",
    "i.e. the alcock - paczynski effect @xcite  on measurements of rsd .",
    "also , while we were completing our work , independent important contributions in the same direction appeared in the literature by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec sims ] we describe the simulations used and the mass - selected subsamples we defined ; in   [ sec rsd ] we discuss the technical tools used to estimate and model the two - point correlation function in redshift space , @xmath8 , and to estimate the intrinsic values of bias and distortion to be used as reference ; in   [ sec err ] we present the measured @xmath8 and show the resulting statistical and systematic errors on @xmath4 , as a function of the halo bias ; here we discuss in detail how well objects related to high - bias halos , as groups and clusters , can be used to measure rsd ; in   [ sec form ]",
    "we organise all our results into a compact analytic formula as a function of galaxy density , bias and survey volume ; we then directly compare these results to the predictions of a fisher matrix code ; finally we summarize our results in ",
    "[ sec concl ] .",
    "the core of this study is based on the high - resolution baryonic acoustic - oscillation simulations at the institute for computational cosmology ( basicc ) of @xcite , which used @xmath17 particles of mass @xmath18 to follow the growth of structure in dark matter in a periodic box of side @xmath19 .",
    "the simulation volume was chosen to allow for growth of fluctuations to be modelled accurately on a wide range of scales including those of bao .",
    "the very large volume of the box also allows us to extract accurate measurements of the clustering of massive halos .",
    "the mass resolution of the simulation is high enough to resolve halos that should host the galaxies expected to be seen in forthcoming high - redhift galaxy surveys ( as e.g. luminous red galaxies in the case of sdss - iii boss ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted are broadly consistent with recent data from the cosmic microwave background and the power spectrum of galaxy clustering ( @xcite ) : the matter density parameter is @xmath20 , the cosmological constant density parameter @xmath21 , the normalization of density fluctuations , expressed in terms of their linear amplitude in spheres of radius @xmath22 at the present day @xmath23 , the primordial spectral index @xmath24 , the dark energy equation of state @xmath25 , and the reduced hubble constant @xmath26 .",
    "we note the high value of normalization of the power spectrum @xmath27 , with respect to more recent wmap estimates ( @xmath28 , @xcite ) .",
    "this has no effect on the results discussed here ( but see @xcite for a method to scale self - consistently the output of a simulation to a different background cosmology ) .",
    "outputs of the particle positions and velocities are stored from the simulations at selected redshifts .",
    "dark matter halos are identified using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) percolation algorithm @xcite with a linking length of @xmath29 times the mean particle separation .",
    "position and velocity are given by the values of the center of mass . in this paper , only groups with al least @xmath30 particles are considered ( i.e only halos with mass @xmath31 ) .",
    "this limit provides reliable samples in term of their abundance and clustering , which we checked by comparing the halo mass function and correlation function against @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "we use the complete catalogue of halos of the simulation at @xmath32 , from which we select sub - samples with different mass thresholds ( i.e. number of particles ) .",
    "this corresponds to samples with different bias values .",
    "table [ tab halo masses ] reports the main features of these catalogues .",
    ".properties of the halo catalogues used in the analysis .",
    "@xmath33 is the threshold value of @xmath34 , e.g. the catalogue @xmath35 is the set of groups ( i.e. halos ) with at least @xmath36 dm particles ; @xmath37 is the corresponding threshold mass ; @xmath38 is the total number of halos ( i.e. the number of halos with @xmath39 ) ; @xmath40 is the number density ( i.e. @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the simulation volume ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in doing this exercise , a specific problem is that , as shown in table  [ tab halo masses ] , catalogues with larger mass ( i.e. higher bias ) are also less dense .",
    "our aim is to separate the dependence of the errors on these two variables .",
    "to do so , once a population of a given bias is defined by choosing a given mass threshold , we construct a series of diluted samples obtained by randomly removing objects .",
    "the process is repeated down to a minimum density of @xmath43 , at which shot noise dominates and for the least massive halos the recovered @xmath4 is consistent with zero . in this way",
    ", we obtain a series of sub - samples of varying density for fixed bias , as reported in table  [ tab dilution ] .",
    "the full samples are the same used to build , e.g. , figure [ fig beta lin - exp ] .    in figure [ fig surface ]",
    "we plot the relative errors on @xmath4 measured from each catalogue of table [ tab dilution ] , as a function of the bias factor and the number density .",
    "these 3d plots are meant to provide an overview of the global behavior of the errors ; a more detailed description is provided in figures [ fig fisher n]-[fig fisher b ] , where 2d sections along @xmath40 and @xmath7 are reported .",
    "for all the samples considered , the volume is held fixed .    as shown by the figure ,",
    "the bias dependence is weak and approximately described by @xmath44 , i.e. the error is slightly larger for higher - bias objects .",
    "this indicates that the gain of a stronger clustering signal is more than cancelled by the reduction of the distortion signal , when higher bias objects are considered .",
    "this is however fully true only for samples which are not too sparse intrinsically .",
    "we see in fact that at extremely low densities , the relationship is inverted , with high - bias objects becoming favoured . at the same time , there is a clear general flattening of the dependence of the error on the mean density @xmath40 . the relation is not a simple power - law , but becomes constant at high values of @xmath40 . in comparison , over the density range considered here , the old scaling formula of guzzo et al . would overestimate the error significantly .",
    "this behaviour is easily interpreted as showing the transition from a shot - noise dominated regime at low densities to a cosmic - variance dominated one , in which there is no gain in further increasing the sampling .",
    "such behaviour is clear for low - mass halos ( i.e. low bias ) but is much weaker for more massive , intrinsically rare objects .",
    "we can now try to model an improved empirical relation to reproduce quantitatively these observed dependences .",
    "let us first consider the general trend , @xmath45 , which describes well the trend of @xmath46 in the cosmic variance dominated region ( i.e. at high density ) . in figure [ fig surface ] such a power - law",
    "is represented by a plane .",
    "we then need a function capable to warp the plane in the low density region , where the relative error becomes shot - noise dominated .",
    "the best choice seems to be an exponential : @xmath47 , where , by construction , @xmath48 roughly corresponds to the threshold density above which cosmic variance dominates .",
    "finally , we need to add an exponential dependence on the bias so that at low density the relative error decreases with @xmath7 , such that the full expression becomes @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the grid shown in figure [ fig surface ] represents the result of a direct fit of this functional form to the data , showing that it is indeed well suited to describe the overall behaviour . in the right panel we have oriented the axes as to highlight the goodness of the fit : the _ rms _ of the residual between model and data is @xmath50 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest measured values of @xmath46 .",
    "this gives our equation the predictive power we were looking for : if we use it to produce forecasts of the precision of @xmath4 for a given survey , we shall commit a negligible error ( figure [ fig fisher n ] ) , with the _ rms _ of the residuals , @xmath50 . ]",
    "( @xmath51 ) on @xmath46 ( at least for values of bias and volume within the ranges tested here ) . to fully complete the relation , we only need to add the dependence on the volume , which is in principle the easiest .",
    "to this end , we split the whole simulation cube into @xmath52 sub - cubes , with @xmath53 . by applying this procedure to 5 samples with different bias and number density ( see table [ tab dilution ] ) we make sure that our results do not depend on the particular choice of bias and density .",
    "figure [ fig rbt vs vol ] shows that @xmath54 independently of @xmath40 and @xmath7 , confirming the dependence found by @xcite .",
    "we can thus finally write the full scaling formula for the relative error of @xmath4 we were seeking for @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "clearly , by construction , this scaling formula quantifies random errors , not the systematic ones .",
    "the fisher information matrix provides a method for determining the sensitivity of a particular experiment to a set of parameters and has been widely used in cosmology . in particular , @xcite introduced an implementation of the fisher matrix aimed at forecasting errors on cosmological parameters derived from the galaxy power spectrum @xmath58 , based on its expected observational uncertainty , as described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "this was adapted by @xcite to the measurements of distances using the baryonic acoustic oscillations in @xmath58 . following the renewed interest in rsd , over the past few years",
    "the fisher matrix technique has also been applied to predict the errors expected on @xmath4 , @xmath59 and related parameters ( e.g * ? ? ?",

    "the extensive simulations performed here provides us with a natural opportunity to perform a first simple and direct test of these predictions .",
    "given the number of details that enter in the fisher matrix implementation , this can not be considered as exhaustive . yet , a number of interesting indications emerge , as we shall see .",
    "we have computed fisher matrices for all catalogues in table [ tab dilution ] , using a code following @xcite . in particular , our fisher matrix predicts errors on @xmath4 and @xmath7 , given the errors on the linear redshift space power spectrum modeled as in eq .",
    "( [ eq kaiser spectrum beta ] ) @xcite .",
    "we first limit the computations to linear scales , applying the standard cut - off @xmath60 .",
    "we also explore the possibility of including wavenumbers as large as @xmath61 ( that should better match the typical scales we fit in the correlation functions from the simulations ) , accounting for non - linearity through a conventional small - scale lorentzian damping term .",
    "our fiducial cosmology corresponds to that used in the simulation , i.e. @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath62 and @xmath23 today .",
    "we also choose @xmath63 km s@xmath64 as reference value for the pairwise dispersion .",
    "we do not consider geometric distortions @xcite , whose impact on rsd is addressed in the parallel paper by @xcite . to obtain the fisher predictions on @xmath4",
    ", we marginalize over the bias , to account for the uncertainty on its precise value , and on the pairwise velocity in the damping term ( when present ) .",
    "figure [ fig fisher n ] shows the measured relative errors on @xmath4 as a function of the number density , compared to the fisher forecasts for the two choices of @xmath65 .",
    "we also plot the scaling relation from eq .",
    "( [ eq err mine general ] ) , which best represents the simulation results .",
    "we see that the simulation results are in in fairly good agreement with the fisher predictions , when we limit the computation to very linear scales in the power spectrum ( solid line ) .",
    "the inclusion of higher wavenumbers produces unrealistically small errors and with a wrong dependence on the number density .",
    "both the solid lines and points reproduce the observed flattening at high number densities , which corresponds to the transition between a shot - noise and a cosmic - variance dominated regime , respectively .    similarly ,",
    "figure [ fig fisher b ] looks at the dependence of the error on the linear bias parameter , comparing the simulation results ( points and scaling formula best - fit ) to the fisher forecasts .",
    "the behaviour is similar to that observed for the number density : there is a a fairly good agreement when the fisher predictions are computed using @xmath66 , except for very low values of the number density and the bias .",
    "again , when non - linear scales are included , the fisher predictions become too optimistic by a large factor .",
    "we have performed an extensive investigation of statistical and systematic errors in measurements of the redshift - distortion parameter @xmath4 from future surveys . we have considered tracers of the large - scale distribution of mass with varying levels of bias , corresponding to objects like galaxies , groups and clusters . to this purpose",
    ", we have analyzed large catalogues of dark - matter halos extracted from a snapshot of the basicc simulation at @xmath32 .",
    "our results clearly evidence the limitations of the linear description of redshift - space distortions , showing how errors depend on the typical survey properties ( volume and number density ) and the properties of the tracers ( bias , i.e. typical mass ) .",
    "let us recap them and discuss their main implications .    * estimating @xmath4 using the hamilton / kaiser harmonic expansion of the redshift - space correlation function @xmath1 extended to typical scales , leads to a systematic error of up to @xmath67 .",
    "this is much larger than the statistical error of a few percent reachable by next - generation surveys .",
    "the larger systematic error is found for small bias objects , and decreases reaching a minimum for halos of @xmath68 .",
    "this reinforces the trend observed by @xcite . *",
    "additional analysis of mock surveys from the millennium run confirm that the observed systematic errors are not the result of potentially missing sub - structure in the basicc halo catalogues .",
    "* the use of the deprojected correlation function increases the statistical error , inducing also some additional systematic effects ( details are given in appendix [ sec deprojected ] and also in the companion paper by @xcite ) . * for highly biased objects , which are sparser and whose",
    "surveys typically cover larger , more linear scales , the simple kaiser model describes fairly well the simulated data , without the need of the empirical damping term with one extra parameter accounting for non - linear motions .",
    "this results in smaller statistical errors .",
    "* we have derived a comprehensive scaling formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq err mine general ] ) , to predict the precision ( i.e. relative statistical error ) reachable on @xmath4 as a function of survey parameters .",
    "this expression improves on a previous attempt @xcite , generalizing the prediction to a population of arbitrary bias and properly describing the dependence on the number density . +",
    "this formula can be useful to produce quite general and reliable forecasts for future surveys ] .",
    "one should in any case consider that there are a few implementation - specific factors that can modify the absolute values of the recovered _ rms _ errors .",
    "for example , these would depend on the range of scales over which @xmath1 is fitted .",
    "the values obtained here refer to fits performed between @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this has been identified through several experiments as an optimal range to minimize statistical and systematic errors for surveys this size @xcite .",
    "theoretically , one may find natural to push @xmath71 , or both @xmath72 and @xmath71 to larger scales , as to ( supposedly ) reduce the weight of nonlinear scales . in practice , however , in both cases we see that random errors increase in amplitude ( while the systematic error is not appreciably reduced ) .",
    "+ similarly , one should also keep in mind that the formula is strictly valid for @xmath32 , i.e. the redshift where it has been calibrated .",
    "there is no obvious reason to expect the scaling laws among the different quantities ( density , volume , bias ) to depend significantly on the redshift .",
    "this is confirmed by a few preliminary measurements we performed on halo catalogues from the @xmath73 snapshot of the basicc .",
    "conversely , the magnitude of the errors may change , as shown , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "we expect these effects to be described by a simple renormalization of the constant @xmath74 .",
    "+ finally , one may also consider that the standard deviations measured using the 27 sub - cubes could be underestimated , if these are not fully independent .",
    "we minimize this by maximizing the size of each sub - cube , while having enough of them as to build a meaningful statistics .",
    "the side of each of the 27 sub - cubes used is in fact close to @xmath75 , benefiting of the large size of the basicc simulation .",
    "* we have compared the error estimations from our simulations with idealized predictions based on the fisher matrix approach , customarily implemented in fourier space .",
    "we find a good agreement , but only when the fisher computation is limited to significantly large scales , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "when more non - linear scales are included ( as an attempt to roughly match those actually involved in the fitting of @xmath77 in configuration space ) , then the predicted errors become unrealistically small .",
    "this indicates that the usual convention of adopting @xmath78 for these kind of studies is well posed . on the other hand",
    ", it seems paradoxical that in this way with the two methods we are looking at different ranges of scales .",
    "the critical point clearly lies in the idealized nature of the fisher matrix technique .",
    "when moving up with @xmath65 and thus adding more and more nonlinear scales , the fisher technique simply accumulates signal and dramatically improves the predicted error , clearly unaware of the additional `` noise '' introduced by the breakdown of linearity . on the other hand , if in the direct fit of @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 ) one conversely considers a corresponding very linear range @xmath81 , a poor fit is obtained , with much larger statistical errors than shown , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig beta lin - exp ] .",
    "there is no doubt that smaller , mildly nonlinear scales at intermediate separations have necessarily to be included in the modelling if one aims at reaching percent statistical errors on measurements of @xmath4 ( or @xmath59 ) .",
    "if one does this in the fisher matrix , then the predicted errors are too small .",
    "the need to push our estimates to scales which are not fully linear will remain true even with surveys of the next generation , including tens of millions of galaxies over gpc volumes , because that is where the clustering and distortion signals are ( and will still be ) the strongest .",
    "of course , our parallel results on the amount of systematic errors that plague estimates based on the standard dispersion model also reinforce the evidence that better modelling of nonlinear effects is needed on these scales .",
    "the strong effort being spent in this direction gives some confidence that significant technical progress will happen in the coming years ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "+ in any case , this limited exploration suggests once more that forecasts based on the fisher matrix approach , while giving useful guidelines evidence the error dependences , have to be treated with significant caution and possibly verified with more direct methods .",
    "similar tension between fisher and monte carlo forecasts has been recently noticed by @xcite . *",
    "finally , in appendix [ sec likelihood ] we have also clarified which is the most unbiased form to be adopted for the likelihood when fitting models to the observed redshift - space correlation function , proposing a slightly different form with respect to previous works .    with",
    "redshift - space distortions having emerged as probe of primary interest in current and future dark - energy - oriented galaxy surveys , the results presented here further stress the need for improved descriptions of non - linear effects in clustering and dynamical analyses . on the other hand , they also indicate the importance of building surveys for which multiple tracers of rsd ( with different bias values ) can be identified and used in combination to help understanding and minimizing systematic errors .",

    "to estimate @xmath4 , in section [ sec fitting procedure ] we defined a likelihood function comparing the measured correlation function @xmath1 and the corresponding parameterized models .",

    "the dashed line shows as reference the asymptotic common value of @xmath4 that both methods identically recover at high densities .",
    "note how using eq .",
    "[ eq delta y ] yields an unbiased estimate down to significantly smaller densities , whereas the estimator based on eq .",
    "( [ eq scatter hawkins ] ) becomes rapidly more and more biased below @xmath90 .",
    "the intrinsic scatter of the measurements , as usual obtained from the 27 sub - cubes of this specific catalogue , also follows a similar trend . , width=302 ]    however , the weighting factors @xmath91 in the likelihood definition depend explicitly on @xmath89 , which may result in an improper weighting of the data when the correlation signal fluctuates near zero .",
    "we have directly verified that when the estimate is noisy , it is preferable to use a smooth weighting scheme rather than one that is sensitive to local random oscillations of @xmath92 , which is more likely to yield biased estimates .",
    "this supported our choice of adopting the usual sample - variance expression @xmath93 estimated over @xmath94 realizations of the survey .",
    "this can be done using mock realizations @xcite , or , alternatively , through appropriate jack - knife or booststrap resamplings of the data . specifically , we find a significant advantage of the weighting scheme based on sample variance when dealing with low - density samples .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig bt vs n 20 ] , where @xmath4 is estimated on the catalogue with @xmath95 using the two likelihoods and gradually diluting the sample ( note that all computations in this section use the linear - exponential model , with @xmath96 directly measured in real - space ) .    in order to understand the reasons behind this behaviour",
    ", we have studied independently the various terms composing the likelihood .",
    "we use one single sub - cube ( i.e. 1/27 of the total volume ) , from the catalogue with @xmath97 , and consider two extreme values of the mean density .",
    "first , we consider the case of the highest density achievable by this halo catalogue , @xmath98 . in the upper panel of figure [ fig enzo perc100 pi9.75 refhawkins ] we plot a section of @xmath1 at constant @xmath99 , together with the model @xmath100 corresponding to the best - fit @xmath4 and @xmath101 parameters . in this density regime",
    "the values of the recovered best - fit parameters are essentially independent of the form chosen for @xmath102 ( as shown by the coincident values of @xmath4 on the right side of figure [ fig bt vs n 20 ] ) .",
    "the match of the model to the data is very good . in the central panel ,",
    "we plot instead , for each bin @xmath103 along @xmath9 , the absolute value of the difference between model and observation , @xmath104 , together with the corresponding standard deviations in the two cases , which are virtually indistinguishable from each other .",
    "finally , the lower panel shows the full values of the terms contributing to the @xmath82 sum , again showing the equivalence of the two choices in this density regime .    .",
    "top panel : cut - through @xmath1 at fixed @xmath105 ( broken line ) , and corresponding best fit model @xmath100 using the hawkins et al .",

    "central panel : residual values @xmath106 between the data and model values ( light grey line ) and values for the scatter of each point , according to the two definitions of eqs .",

    "bottom panel : corresponding terms in the @xmath82 sum ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq fit app ] ) ) .",
    "the two definitions for the scatter , as expected , produce virtually identical values for the likelihood . , width=302 ]    however ,",
    "when we sparsely sample the catalogue , as to reach a mean density of @xmath107 @xmath108 ( leaving all other parameters unchanged ) , a very different behaviour emerges ( figure [ fig enzo perc3.08 pi9.75 refhawkins ] ) ( upper panel , second blue square from the left ) we show the same behaviour when averaged over 27 sub - samples . ] .",

    "again , the model curve in the top panel corresponds to the best - fit parameters obtained using the hawkins et al .",
    "form of the scatter of each measurements .",
    "the fit is very unsatisfactory .",
    "the bottom panel shows how the likelihood expression based instead on the standard deviation of @xmath110 as from eq .",
    "( [ eq delta y ] ) rejects these parameter values , giving high @xmath82 values ( red solid curve ) .",
    "note the different scale on the ordinate , with respect to previous figure .",
    ", width=302 ]    using the hawkins et al . definition for the variance yields a best - fit model that overestimates the data on almost all scales ( top panel ) , corresponding to unphysical values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the central panel now shows how in this regime the two definitions of the scatter , ( which weigh the data - model difference ) , behave in a significantly different way , with the hawkins et al .",
    "definition being much less stable than the one used here , and in general anti - correlated with the values of @xmath1 in the upper panel . in the lower panel ,",
    "the dashed line shows how this anti - correlation smooths down the @xmath113 peaks resulting in erroneously low values for the @xmath82 that drive the fit to a wrong region of the parameter space . in the same panel ,",
    "the solid line shows how the likelihood computed with our definition for these same parameters gives high @xmath82 values , thus correctly rejecting the model ( and @xmath114 ) we find @xmath115 .",
    "consequently , @xmath116 is not well defined ( figure [ fig enzo perc3.08 pi9.75 refhawkins ] , central panel ) resulting in a zero weight for the corresponding @xmath82 summand ( lower panel ) . ] .",
    "in a real survey , the direct measurement of @xmath96 is not possible . a way around this obstacle is to project @xmath1 along the line of sight , i.e. along the direction affected by redshift distortions .",
    "we hence define the projected correlation function as @xmath117 inverting the integral we recover @xmath96 .",
    "more precisely , following @xcite , we have @xmath118 where @xmath10 is the usual mathematical constant , not to be confused with the line - of - sight separation @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq projected ] ) .    a more extended investigation of the effects arising when using the deprojected @xmath96 instead of that directly measured ( hereafter @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively )",
    "is carried out in @xcite . here",
    "we limit the discussion to the impact of the deprojection technique on the estimate of @xmath4 , as a function of the mass ( i.e. the bias ) of the adopted tracers , focussing on the systematic effects ( figure [ fig beta dep ] ) .",
    "obtained when the real - space correlation function @xmath96 is directly measured from the simulation ( triangles ) or deprojected as in real surveys ( rhombs and inverted triangles ) .",
    "the latter correspond to two different integration limits @xmath121 in the projection .",
    "the two lower panels give ths systematic and statistical error as in figure  [ fig lin vs exp].,width=302 ]    one possible source of systematic error in performing the de - projection is the necessity of defining a finite integration limit @xmath121 in eq .",
    "( [ eq deprojected ] ) . in figure [ fig beta dep ]",
    "two different choices of @xmath121 are considered .",
    "we notice that these choices ( purple inverted triangles and yellow rhombs ) result in different slopes of @xmath4 as a function of bias , which differ from the slope obtained using @xmath120 ( green triangles ) .",
    "this is plausibly due to the fact that using a limiting @xmath121 we are underestimating the integral ( consider that @xmath122 for @xmath123 ) .",
    "this effect grows when the bias increases , because of the corresponding growth of @xmath92 which leads to a larger `` loss of power '' in @xmath124 .",
    "however , we can not use arbitrarily large values of @xmath121 because the statistical error increases for larger @xmath121 ( see lowest panel of figure [ fig beta dep ] ) .",
    "this may be due to the increase of the shot noise at large separations .",
    "similarly , the drop of correlation signal at small separations due to the finite size of the dark matter halos produces an impact on @xmath4 which grows with bias .",
    "finally , as suggested previously @xcite and discussed extensively in @xcite , figure [ fig beta dep ] shows how using @xmath119 in modelling rsd , produces a statistical error about twice as large as that obtained using @xmath120 ( lower panel ) ."
