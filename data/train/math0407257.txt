    "the system is located in a constant exterior magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "we have denoted by @xmath6 , @xmath7 , div , curl respectively the laplace operator , gradient , divergence and curl operators according to the space variable @xmath8 , in the euclidian metric of @xmath1 .",
    "the positive constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 are coupling constants , and @xmath11 is the external normal vector to the boundary of @xmath0 . the real lam constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 are such that : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the system ( [ magneto ] ) has a natural time - decreasing energy : @xmath17 when @xmath0 is simply connected , g.  perla menzala and e.  zuazua have showed that this energy tends to zero as time tends to infinity , which is a simple consequence , using la salle invariance principle , of the non - existence of stationnary solution for ( [ magneto ] ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give estimates on the speed of this convergence .",
    "the system ( [ magneto ] ) may be seen as a coupling between the lam system : @xmath18 with dirichlet boundary conditions , which is a conservative system , and the following heat equation : @xmath19 the decay of energy is produced by this strongly dissipative equation . from the point of view of @xmath20 , the dissipation is caused by the coupling term : @xmath21 .",
    "let us first consider the uniform decay with respect to initial condition of the energy : @xmath22 where @xmath23 if independent of the initial condition . in this case",
    "it is easy to show , using the semi - group property of the equation ( [ magneto ] ) , that @xmath23 maybe taken as a negative exponential function .    in paragraph",
    "[ intro.dec.unif ] we state , with a technical hypothesis on @xmath0 , a necessary and sufficient condition on the geometry of the problem for ( [ stab.unif ] ) to hold .",
    "when this condition is not fulfilled , there exist rays on @xmath0 , named @xmath24-resistant rays , along which the energy of some solutions of ( [ magneto ] ) concentrates , and the dissipative term @xmath25 is very small .",
    "indeed , when such a ray exists , there is a sequence of solutions of ( [ magneto ] ) concentrating on the ray and which is in first approximation parallel to @xmath24",
    ".    when there is no uniform stabilization we show ( with the same technical property on @xmath0 than before ) , that solutions of ( [ magneto ] ) decay with polynomial speed for smooth enough initial data ( cf paragraph [ intro.dec.poly ] ) .",
    "the speed of decay still depends on the geometry of @xmath0 . in this case , the possible existence of boundary @xmath24-resistant rays ( i.e. living only in the boundary of @xmath0 ) of infinite life - length is the main obstacle to the decay .    before giving more explicit results , let us mention some earlier works on related subjects . as it was already stated , the convergence to @xmath26 for the energy of magnetoelasticity in a bounded , simply connected domain was shown by g.  perla menzana and e.  zuazua in @xcite , but their method does not give any information on the rate of convergence . by energy methods ,",
    "mu~ noz rivera and racke @xcite , muoz rivera and de lima santos @xcite have shown the rate of convergence to be at least polynomial , in dimension @xmath27 or @xmath28 , but only for some precise types of domains .",
    "andreou and dassios @xcite have examined the same system on the entire space @xmath1 , showing again polynomial decay for some initial conditions .",
    "the linear system of thermoelasticity has been more precisely understood . in this system , the lam equations are coupled with a scalar heat equation .",
    "the dissipation is caused by the longitudinal part of the lam equation ( the curl - free part of @xmath20 ) . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors give ( under a spectral assumption ) a necessary and sufficient condition on @xmath0 , of geometrical nature , for the uniform decay in dimension @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "namely , this decay is equivalent to the non - existence of rays , called `` transversal polarization rays '' , carrying the transversal component of @xmath20 ( the divergence - free component ) , which resists to the dissipation . in @xcite",
    ", the authors also prove the polynomial decay in dimension @xmath27 , under the same spectral assumption , which is namely that the operator associated to the equation does not admit any real eigenvalue . as shown in @xcite , this spectral condition",
    "is always fulfilled for the system of magnetoelasticity in a bounded , simply - connected domain .",
    "the comparison of the two systems of thermo and magnetoelasticity show that thermoelasticity is slightly less dissipative ( the coupling of the lam system with the heat equation is weaker ) , and more difficult to describe , because of the non - trivial polarization of transversal waves .",
    "assume that @xmath29 has no contact of infinite order with its tangents .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian flow of the symbol of a dalembertian @xmath30 , which is defined locally in @xmath31 ( the spherical cotangent bundle of @xmath0 ) , maybe extended until the boundary of this bundle to a global flow , the generalized bicharacteristic flow , wich may be seen as a continuous flow on the spherical compressed cotangent bundle @xmath32 ( cf @xcite ) . we shall call bicharacteristic rays or just rays the characteristic curves of this flow .",
