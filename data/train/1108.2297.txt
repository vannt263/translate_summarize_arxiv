    "orbital photometric phase variations have long been used in the study and characterisation of eclipsing binaries @xcite , where the large masses and small orbital radii result in phase variations at the magnitude to millimagnitude level .",
    "the three dominant components of these variations are i ) ellipsoidal variations , due to the non - spherical nature of a star caused by gravitational distortion ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ) ii ) relativistic beaming , due to the radial motion of the star shifting the stellar spectrum ( e.g. @xcite ) iii ) reflected / emitted light , which varies depending on what phase of a body is visible ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the visible bandpass orbital phase variations of a star due to a hot - jupiter companion are much smaller - around the part - per - million ( ppm ) level - and thus have eluded detection until relatively recently .",
    "the high precision space - based photometry of corot ( 0.56 - 0.71@xmath0 m ) @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite have opened up this exciting new way of studying exoplanets for first time , with several detections recently reported in the literature :    * corot-1b @xcite ; reflected / emitted light amplitude @xmath7ppm * hat - p-7b @xcite ; ellipsoidal amplitude @xmath8ppm , reflected / emitted light amplitude @xmath9ppm * corot-3b @xcite ; ellipsoidal amplitude @xmath10ppm , beaming amplitude @xmath11ppm * kepler-7b @xcite ; reflected / emitted light amplitude @xmath12ppm    in this letter , we investigate the hot - jupiter orbiting the g0v star tres-2 @xcite , where we detect a reflected / emitted light amplitude of @xmath13ppm to a confidence of @xmath14 , or 99.98% .",
    "we also measure the ellipsoidal variation and relativistic beaming amplitudes to be @xmath15ppm and @xmath16ppm respectively , which are broadly consistent with theoretical expectation .",
    "if our detected signal is interpreted as being purely due to scattering , then the corresponding geometric albedo would be @xmath3 ( using system parameters from table 2 , column 2 of @xcite ( kb11 ) , as will be done throughout this work ) , meaning that just four months of _ kepler _ s exquisite photometry has detected light from the darkest exoplanet yet found . extrapolating to a 6year baseline , one can expect to detect albedos @xmath17 ( to 3@xmath2 confidence ) at similar orbital radii down to @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "this clearly highlights the extraordinary potential which would be granted by an extended mission for _",
    "we make use of `` data release 3 '' ( dr3 ) from the _ kepler mission _ , which consists of quarters 0 , 1 and 2 ( q0 , q1 & q2 ) .",
    "full details on the data processing pipeline can be found in the dr3 handbook .",
    "the data includes the use of bjd ( barycentric julian date ) time stamps for each flux measurement , which is crucial for time sensitive measurements .",
    "all data used are publicly available via mast .",
    "we use the `` raw '' ( labelled as `` ap_raw_flux '' in the header ) short - cadence ( sc ) data processed by the dr3 pipeline and a detailed description can be found in the accompanying release notes .",
    "the `` raw '' data has been subject to pa ( photometric analysis ) , which includes cleaning of cosmic ray hits , argabrightenings , removal of background flux , aperture photometry and computation of centroid positions .",
    "it does not include pdc ( pre - search data conditioning ) algorithm developed by the dawg ( data analysis working group ) . as detailed in dr3 ,",
    "this data is not recommended for scientific use , owing to , in part , the potential for under / over - fitting of the systematic effects .",
    "the raw data exhibit numerous systematic artifacts , including pointing tweaks ( jumps in the photometry ) , safe mode recoveries ( exponential decays ) and focus drifts ( long - term trends ) .",
    "the first effect may be corrected by applying an offset surrounding the jump , computed using a 30-point interpolative function either side . due to the exponential nature of the second effect , we chose to exclude the affected data rather than",
    "attempt to correct it .",
    "the third effect may be corrected for using a detrending technique .    for this latter effect",
    ", we use the cosine filter utilised to detect ellipsoidal variations in corot data by @xcite .",
    "the technique acts as a high - pass filter allowing any frequencies of the orbital period or higher through and all other long - term trends are removed .",
    "thus , we protect any physical flux variations on the time scale of interest .",
    "we applied the filter independently to q0+q1 data and then q2 data .",
    "this is because the _ kepler _ spacecraft was rotated in the intervening time and so the long - term trend will not be continuous over this boundary . after removing 3@xmath2 outliers with a running 20-point median and transits using the ephemeris of kb11",
    ", we applied the filter , with the resulting fitted trends shown in fig  [ fig : detrending ] .",
    "our final cleaned data consists of 154,832 sc measurements with a mean snr@xmath20 .",
    "we first define our null hypothesis , @xmath21 , where we employ a flat line model across the entire time series , described by a constant @xmath22 . for a physical description of the orbital phase variations",
    ", we first tried the same model as that used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this simple model is sufficient for cases where one is dealing with low signal - to - noise and reproduces the broad physical features .",
    "the model , @xmath23 , is given by    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the orbital phase ( defined as being 0 at the time of transit minimum ) and @xmath26 are coefficients related to the physical model .",
    "@xmath22 is simply a constant to remove any dc ( direct - current ) component in the data .",
    "@xmath27 corresponds to the reflection / emission effect and is expected to be have a negative amplitude .",
    "@xmath28 corresponds to the relativistic beaming effect and is expected to be positive .",
    "@xmath29 corresponds to the ellipsoidal variations and should be negative .",
    "@xmath30 is a dummy term which should be zero and ensures the ellipsoidal variation is detected with the correct phase .",
    "we also tried a third model , @xmath31 , where the @xmath27 term is replaced by the reflection caused by a lambertian sphere :    @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in addition to three models , we have three data input modes .",
    "the first is simply corrected for detrending and nothing else , denoted @xmath33 .",
    "the second mode renormalises each orbital period epoch .",
    "this renormalisation is done by computing the median of each epoch and dividing each segmented time series by this value and we denote this mode as @xmath34 . finally , we tried allowing each orbital period epoch to have its own variable renormalisation parameter , which is simultaneously fitted to the data along with the orbital phase curve model .",
    "this parameter is dubbed @xmath35 for the @xmath36 orbital period epoch . denoting this data input mode as @xmath37",
    ", the fits now include an additional 51 free parameters .",
    "the models are fitted to the unbinned data using a markov chain monte carlo algorithm described in kb11 ( method a ) with @xmath38 accepted trials burning out the first 25,000 . in total",
    ", there are nine ways of combining the three models with the three data modes .",
    "all nine models are fitted and results are given in table  [ tab : results ] , with our preferred model description being @xmath23 , @xmath37 ( since thermal emission is likely dominant over scattering , see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] presents the results of fitting the detrended _ kepler _ photometry .",
    "our models make no prior assumption on the sign or magnitude of the @xmath26 coefficients .",
    "the orbital period and transit epoch are treated as gaussian priors from the circular orbit results of kb11 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : results ]        when considering statistical significance , what one is really interested in is the confidence of detecting each physical effect i.e. reflection / emission , ellipsoidal and beaming .",
    "for this reason , model comparison tools , such as the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) or an f - test are inappropriate .",
    "this is because these methods evaluate the preference of one hypothesis over another , where the two models would be a null - hypothesis and a hypothesis including reflection / emission , ellipsoidal variations , beaming and the dummy term .",
    "thus , any inference drawn from this would be for the _ entire _ model and not for each individual effect . in the analysis presented here , simple inspection of the posteriors from fig  [",
    "fig : super ] shows that only one effect is actually detected ( reflection / emission ) , but a model comparison method would evaluate the significance of all four physical effects ( including the dummy term ) versus no effect .",
    "a more useful statistical test would consider the significance of each physical effect individually from a joint fit .",
    "an excellent tool to this end is the odds ratio test discussed in @xcite .",
    "if a parameter was equal to zero , we would expect 50% of the mcmc runs to give a positive value and 50% to give a negative value .",
    "consider that some asymmetry exists and a fraction @xmath39 of all mcmc trial were positive and @xmath40 were negative .",
    "the reverse could also be true and so we define @xmath39 such that @xmath41 i.e. it represents the majority of the mcmc trials .",
    "the odds ratio of the asymmetric model over the 50:50 model is :    @xmath42    for only two possible models , the probability of the asymmetric model being the correct one is @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "we perform this test on each of the four parameters fitted for , @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 .",
    "the associated results are visible in the top - left corners of each posterior shown in fig  [ fig : super ] , for our preferred model and data mode i.e. @xmath23 , @xmath37 . to summarise",
    ", only one parameter presents a significant detection - the reflection / emission effect . here , we find @xmath27 s posterior is sufficiently asymmetric to have a probability of occurring by random chance of just 0.02% , which equates to 3.67@xmath2 .",
    "we consider any signal detected above 3@xmath2 confidence to merit the claim of a `` detection '' rather than a measurement and thus we find tres-2b to be the darkest exoplanet from which visible light has been detected .    as discussed in  [ sub:3models ] , we tried two different models for the reflection / emission effect ; a simple sinusoid ( @xmath23 ) and the reflected light from a perfectly lambertian sphere ( @xmath31 ) . between the two models , there is negligible difference in the goodness - of - fit , as seen in table  [ tab : results ] , for all three data modes . including the lambertian model takes some power away from the ellipsoidal variations though and thus the current data does not yield a preference between a lambertian sphere model or stronger ellipsoidal variations .",
    "the duration of the transit , and thus occultation since tres-2b maintains negligible eccentricity , is equal to @xmath44seconds ( defined as the time between when the planet s centre crosses the stellar limb to exiting under the same condition ) .",
    "in contrast , the orbital period of tres-2b is @xmath45days .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath4646 times more integration time of the orbit than the occultation event .",
    "this indicates that we should expect to be able to reach a sensitivity of @xmath47 times greater , purely from photon statistics .",
    "the uncertainty on our phase curve measurement is @xmath48ppm .",
    "we therefore estimate that one should have an uncertainty on the occultation depth of @xmath49ppm .",
    "if we assume the nightside has a negligible flux , then the depth of the occultation is expected to be @xmath50ppm ( i.e. equal to the day - night contrast ) , and this already suggests that the present publicly available _ kepler _ photometry will be insufficient to detect the occultation . to test this hypothesis , we will here fit the occultation event including the q0 , q1 and q2 data .    to perform our fit",
    ", we use the same gaussian priors on @xmath51 and @xmath52 as earlier .",
    "we also adopt priors for other important system parameters from kb11 , such as @xmath53 , @xmath54% and @xmath55seconds .",
    "we stress that these are all priors and not simply fixed parameters .",
    "we also make use of the priors on the @xmath35 coefficients from the @xmath31 , @xmath37 fit .",
    "data are trimmed to be within @xmath56days of the expected time of occultation to prevent the phase curve polluting our signal , leaving us with 8457 sc measurements . assuming a circular orbit , the data were fitted using an mcmc algorithm .",
    "the marginalised posterior of the occultation depth yields @xmath57ppm , which is clearly not a significant detection .",
    "the derived uncertainty of 13 - 14ppm is very close to our estimation of @xmath49ppm and thus supports our hypothesis that the current _ kepler _ data are insufficient to detect the occultation of tres-2b .",
    "we also note that the inclusion of the q2 data does improve the constraints on the occultation event ( kb11 found @xmath58ppm using q0 & q1 only ) .",
    "hot - jupiters are generally expected to be dark",
    ". significant absorption due to the broad wings of the sodium and potassium d lines is thought to dominate their visible spectra @xcite , leading to low albedos of a few percent . indeed , aside from the recent report of kepler-7b s @xmath59% _ kepler_-band geometric albedo ( kb11 ) ,",
    "searches for visible light from hot - jupiters have generally revealed mere upper limits ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 6.5@xmath601.9ppm contrast ( determined from our preferred model @xmath23 , @xmath37 ) between the day - side and night - side photon flux that we measure for tres-2b represents the most sensitive measurement yet of emergent radiation in the visible from a hot - jupiter , and is a factor of @xmath4620 and @xmath466 dimmer than the corresponding differences for hat - p-7b @xcite and kepler-7b .    in order to interpret the visible flux",
    ", we use the planetary atmosphere modelling code cooltlusty @xcite . for simplicity , we adopt equilibrium chemistry with nearly solar abundance of elements , although we leave titanium oxide and vanadium oxide ( tio and vo ) out of the atmosphere model . these compounds could , if present in the upper atmosphere of a hot - jupiter , strongly affect the atmosphere structure and the visible and near infrared spectra , by making the atmosphere more opaque in the visible and by leading to a thermal inversion if the stellar irradiation exceeds @xmath4610@xmath61@xmath62 @xcite .",
    "we leave tio and vo out of our calculations , however , because of the difficulty of maintaining heavy , condensible species high in the atmospheres @xcite .",
    "instead , we use an ad hoc extra opacity source @xmath63 , as described in @xcite .",
    "we calculate a grid of models with @xmath63 ranging ( in @xmath64 ) from 0 to 0.6 in steps of 0.1 and with redistribution @xmath65 ranging from 0 to 0.5 in steps of 0.1 ( @xmath65 represents the fraction of incident irradiation that is transported to the nightside , which is assumed in our models to occur in a pressure range from 10 to 100mbars ) . for each of these 42 parameter combinations ,",
    "we calculate a day - side model , a night - side model , and a model that has the same temperature / pressure structure as the dayside but that has the star turned off , so as to calculate the emitted ( and not scattered ) flux ( thus also giving the scattered component ) .",
    "we draw several inferences from our models and the data .",
    "first , the nightside contributes negligible flux in the _ kepler_-band ( always @xmath6612% of the dayside , and for most models significantly less than that ) , meaning that the 6.5ppm number represents essentially the entire day - side flux .",
    "second , by also including the available infrared secondary eclipse data on tres-2b @xcite , we find that in our model set there must be some redistribution ( but not too much ) and there must be some extra absorber ( but not too much ) . for each model",
    ", we compute a @xmath67 value , including 6 data points : _ kepler_-band , _",
    "ks_-band , and the four _ spitzer _ irac channels ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 & 8.0@xmath0 m ) .",
    "fig  [ fig : pnkappa ] portrays the @xmath67 values of our grid of models , with the colour ranges corresponding to the @xmath67 values bounding 68.3% of the integrated probability ( 1@xmath2 ) , 95.5% ( 2@xmath2 ) , 99.7% ( 3@xmath2 ) and 99.99% ( 4@xmath2 ) .",
    "the models that best explain the available data correspond to @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath4630% of incident flux redistributed to the night ) . in particular , models with no extra absorber",
    "are completely inconsistent with observations , even on the basis of the _ kepler _ data alone . the upshot is that some extra opacity source appears to be required to explain the emergent radiation from this extremely dark world .",
    "owing to this optical opacity , our models that are consistent with the data have thermal inversions in their upper atmosphere , as in @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite find that the ir data of tres-2b may be explained by models both with and without thermal inversions ; nevertheless , we believe that optical opacity sufficient to explain the _ kepler _ data is likely to heat the upper atmosphere , as per @xcite .    finally , by computing the scattered contribution to the total flux , we find that for all parameter combinations the scattered light contributes @xmath7010% of the _ kepler_-band flux , and for the best - fit models the scattered light is @xmath701.5% of the total .",
    "tres-2b , therefore , appears to have an extremely low geometric albedo ( for all models , the geometric albedo is @xmath4% , and for the best - fit models it is @xmath460.04% ) .",
    "exact values for the amount of extra optical opacity , redistribution and the albedo can not be presently provided because inferences about them depend on unknown quantities such as the wavelength dependence of the extra opacity source and the altitude dependence of winds .    ) and moderate extra optical opacity ( @xmath63 ) .",
