    "the relationship between star formation and local galaxy density is one of the clearest pieces of evidence of the effect of environment on galaxy evolution . in the local universe the star - formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies increases with galaxy density up to the scale of galaxy groups , and then drops sharply in the denser environment of clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
