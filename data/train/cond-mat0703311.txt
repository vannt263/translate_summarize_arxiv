    "in this review we present results of our recent investigations@xcite addressing several problems in the field of open quantum systems ; some have a rather long history . with the actual experimental probes now being carried out at the nanoscale , these problems have become more pressing , and some have actually been suggested by the experimental developments.@xcite perhaps the most fundamental ( and difficult ) of these problems is the matter of accounting within a calculationally tractable approach for relaxation vs.  coherent dynamics in open quantum systems .",
    "in particular the coherent and quantum - noise features induced by the bosonic environment ( bath of noninteracting bosonic modes ) are especially interesting , because this model is widely applicable for quantum computing systems . here",
    "we consider bath - induced rkky - type exchange interactions in two - qubit systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , sec .",
    "[ sec : m ] , we formulate the model and discuss the issue of the initial conditions .",
    "an example of the semiconductor ( si - ge type ) based qubit model is given and the nature of the interactions is discussed .",
    "section  [ sec : onset ] is devoted to the initial dynamics of the induced interaction and quantum noise .",
    "in particular , in sec .",
    "[ ssec : os ] we present an exactly solvable model to obtain the exchange interaction as well as the time - dependent correction due to the initial conditions .",
    "the model also demonstrates the delay in the response of the qubits caused by the finite propagation velocities of the mediating virtual bosons . in sec .",
    "[ ssec : dm ] , we study the interplay of the coherent dynamics and quantum noise by calculating the concurrence.@xcite evolution of the reduced density matrix elements is also investigated .    at large times , as the system forgets the initial state , the exchange interaction becomes stationary .",
    "this regime is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : lt ] .",
    "we utilize the master - equation formulation of markovian dynamics , sec .",
    "[ ssec : me ] , and go over an illustrative one - dimensional ( 1d ) example of the emerging interaction and quantum noise in sec .  [ ssec:1d ] .",
    "generalization to higher dimensionality is given in sec .",
    "[ ssec : gd ] .",
    "a solid - state based three - dimensional ( 3d ) example of a semiconductor qubit model is presented in sec .",
    "[ ssec:3d ] . in the latter discussion",
    "we compare bath - induced coupling and noise to other interactions , such as an electromagnetic coupling of p - impurity spins ( qubits ) .",
    "finally , brief summary and outline of some open challenges are offered in sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we consider two qubits , i.e. , two two - state quantum systems , modeled by localized electron spins ( @xmath0 ) immersed in a common quantum environment .",
    "the qubits are located at the distance @xmath1 from each other , far enough so that the direct overlap of the electron wave functions is negligible .",
    "the environment is modeled by a bath of bosonic modes , which are maintained at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "it is usually assumed that external influences , as well as possibly internal bath - mode interactions , set a fast time scale @xmath3 for the bath correlations to equilibrate .",
    "the bath modes are then regarded as otherwise noninteracting .",
    "at least for the low - frequency bath modes , it is usually argued that such a thermalization time for a generic case should be of order @xmath4 .",
    "the thermal - state density matrix of the bath modes , taken here as noninteracting bosonic fields , is @xmath5 \\ , , \\ ] ] where we set @xmath6 , and the partition function is @xmath7 .",
    "the bath is linearly coupled to each qubit , @xmath8 where the superscripts ( @xmath9 ) label the two spins , and the bath operators are given by @xmath10 the overall hamiltonian of the qubit - bath system is @xmath11 where @xmath12 and the two spin-@xmath0 ( qubits ) will be assumed split by external magnetic field , @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the energy gap between the up and down states for spins 1 and 2 .",
    "a natural example of such a system are spins of two localized electrons interacting via lattice vibrations ( phonons ) by means of the spin - orbit interaction.@xcite another example is provided by atoms or ions in a cavity , used as two - state systems interacting with photons.@xcite    our emphasis here will be on calculating and comparing the relative importance of the coherent ( induced interaction ) vs.quantum-noise effects of a given bosonic bath in the two - qubit dynamics .",
    "we do not include other possible two - qubit interactions in such comparative calculation of dynamical quantities . in sec .",
    "[ ssec:3d ] we also include the direct electromagnetic ( em ) coupling for a comparison of the bath - induced and em dipole - dipole interaction strengths .",
    "an interesting realization of the model formulated above can be found in the impurity electron spin dynamics in semiconductors .",
    "let us consider p donor impurities embedded at controlled positions in an otherwise very clean si ( or ge ) crystal matrix .",
    "the system is maintained at very low temperature , as appropriate for quantum computing .",
    "therefore , the outer donor - impurity electron remains bound .",
    "the spins of such localized electrons can be utilized as qubits .",
    "they are subject to external magnetic field @xmath15 , which produces the zeeman splitting ( [ eq : m : h_s ] ) .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction couples the spin to the deformation potential fluctuations of the host semiconductor , producing the energy change @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath18 . here",
    "the tensor @xmath19 is sensitive to lattice deformations .",
    "it was shown@xcite that for the donor state which has tetrahedral symmetry ( which is the case for p in si or ge ) , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : m : h - so ] ) yields the spin - deformation interaction of the form @xmath20 \\\\ \\label{eq : m : h - sd - hxyz } + \\,{\\rm b}\\mu _ { \\textrm{b } } \\left [ { \\bar \\varepsilon _ { xy } \\left ( { \\sigma_x h_y+\\sigma_y h_x}\\right)+{\\text{c}}{\\text{.p}}{\\text{.}}}\\right]\\,.\\ ] ] here c.p .  denotes cyclic permutations and @xmath21 is the effective dilatation .",
    "the tensor @xmath22 already includes averaging of the strain with the gradient of the potential over the donor ground state wave function .    as before , let us assume that we have two impurities separated by distance",
    "d*. for definiteness , one can direct the magnetic field along the @xmath23-axis .",
    "then the spin - deformation interaction hamiltonian simplifies to @xmath24 in terms of the quantized phonon field , we have@xcite @xmath25 where in the spherical donor ground state approximation@xcite @xmath26 here @xmath27 is _ half _ the effective bohr radius of the donor ground state wave function . in an actual si or ge crystal ,",
    "donor states are more complicated and include corrections due to the symmetry of the crystal matrix including the fast bloch - function oscillations .",
    "however , the wave function of the donor electrons in our case is spread over several atomic dimensions ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , it suffices to consider `` envelope '' quantities .",
    "thus , in the spin - phonon hamiltonian ( [ eq : m : h_sb])-([eq : m : x_jm ] ) coupling constants will be taken in the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it will be instructive to consider a one - dimensional calculation , which simplifies the notation .",
    "general results@xcite are presented later in this article .",
    "one can think of a 1d channel geometry along the @xmath23 direction .",
    "this will give an example of an ohmic bath model discussed later . in a 1d channel",
    "the boundaries@xcite can approximately quantize the spectrum of the phonons along @xmath31 and @xmath32 , depleting the density of states except at certain resonant values .",
    "therefore , the low - frequency effects , including the induced coupling and quantum noise , will become effectively one - dimensional , especially if the effective gap due to the confinement is of the order of @xmath33 .",
    "the frequency cutoff comes from ( [ eq : m : f(k ) ] ) , namely , it is due to the bound electron wave function localization . a channel of width comparable to @xmath34 will be required .",
    "this , however , may be difficult to achieve in si or ge with the present - day technology .",
    "other systems may offer more immediately available 1d geometries for testing similar theories , for instance , carbon nanotubes , chains of ionized atoms suspended in ion traps,@xcite etc . in the 1d case , the longitudinal acoustic ( la , @xmath35 ) phonons will account for the @xmath36 component of the coupling , whereas the transverse acoustic ( ta , @xmath37 ) phonons will affect only the @xmath31 and @xmath32 spin projections .",
    "it will be shown later that the contributions of the cross - products of coupling constants , @xmath38 with @xmath39 , to quantities of interest vanish .",
    "the combinations that enter the dynamics are @xmath40 with the usual assumption for the low - frequency dispersion relations @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the expressions ( [ eq : m : gk-1d ] ) lead to the ohmic bath model .",
    "the shape of the frequency cutoff resulting from ( [ eq : m : gk-1d ] ) is not exponential .",
    "however , to estimate the magnitude of the interaction one can equivalently consider the exponential cutoff,@xcite with the summation over bosonic modes carried out as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the density of states .",
    "the coupling constants should then be taken as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the cross section of the channel , and the cutoff is @xmath47 for the @xmath23 component , and @xmath48 for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 components .    for numerical estimates ,",
    "we note that a typical value@xcite of the effective bohr radius in si for the p - donor - electron ground state wave function is @xmath49 nm .",
    "the crystal lattice density is @xmath50kg / m@xmath51 , and the g - factor is @xmath52 . for an order - of - magnitude estimate",
    ", we take a typical value of the phonon group velocity , @xmath53 m/s . the spin - orbit coupling constants in si are@xcite @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the ge lattice ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is dominated by the non - diagonal terms,@xcite @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath58 nm , @xmath59kg / m@xmath51 , @xmath60 m/s , and @xmath61 .",
    "this results in a much stronger transverse component interaction . in both cases",
    "the magnetic field will be taken of order @xmath62 g .",
    "one could use other experimentally suggested values for the parameters , such as , for instance , @xmath63 .",
    "this will not affect the results significantly .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "a realistic phonon environment includes the time scale at which it is reset to the thermal state .",
    "one can think of the short- and long - time dynamics in reference to this time scale . in the long - time regime , it is customary to introduce markovian - type assumptions , which include resetting the bath to the thermal state instantaneously . we will use this approach in the master - equation formulation of the large time dynamics , sec .",
    "[ ssec : me ] .    for the short - time dynamics",
    ", one has to address the matter of the initial conditions at @xmath64 .",
    "we will use the initially factorized density matrix , with the thermal state assumed for the bath . in quantum computing applications , such an initial condition has been widely used for the qubit - bath system,@xcite @xmath65 this choice allows comparison with the markovian results , and is usually needed in order to make the short - time approximation schemes tractable;@xcite specifically , it is necessary for the exact solvability of the model considered in the next section .",
    "a somewhat more `` physical '' excuse for the factorized initial conditions is formulated as follows .",
    "quantum computation is carried out over a sequence of time intervals during which various operations are performed on individual qubits and on pairs of qubits .",
    "these operations include control gates , and measurements for error correction .",
    "it is usually assumed that these `` control '' functions , involving rather strong interactions with external objects , as compared to interactions with sources of quantum noise , erase the fragile entanglement with the bath modes that qubits can develop before those time intervals when they are `` left alone '' to evolve under their internal ( and bath induced ) interactions .",
    "thus , for evaluating relative importance of the quantum noise effects on the internal ( and bath induced ) qubit dynamics , which is our goal here , we can assume that the state of the qubit - bath system is `` reset '' to uncorrelated at @xmath64 .",
    "let us consider relatively short time scales and analyze how the exchange interaction , accompanied by the quantum noise , sets in .",
    "one can argue that such an investigation is only feasible provided one knows the initial condition for the qubits - bath density matrix .",
    "indeed , the short - time interaction ( and quantum noise ) should depend on the initial condition .",
    "the factorized initial condition , with the thermal - state bath , assumed here , is expected in most quantum computing applications , as discussed above .",
    "when the evolution of isolated qubits is slow with respect to the other time scales such as that of decoherence , so that one can assume vanishing qubit splitting energy , @xmath66 , and if only one system operator enters the qubit - bath interaction , then one obtains an exactly solvable model . a more general `` adiabatic '' system that allows exact solvability",
    "is obtained when @xmath67 commutes with @xmath68 .",
    "for example , for electron spins of p - impurities in si one has the spin - phonon interaction dominated by such an adiabatic term , and only one such system operator in the interaction matters for the onset dynamics .",
    "though this situation is rarely the case in quantum computing systems , the present model provides a convenient tool for evaluating the initial dynamics of the exchange interaction build - up , as well as for analyzing the response delay due to the finite speed of the mediating virtual bosonic particles .",
    "these features are difficult to capture analytically in other models .    therefore , let us presently take @xmath69 , while @xmath70 . with the above assumptions",
    ", one can utilize the bosonic operator techniques@xcite to obtain the reduced density matrix for the system ( [ eq : m : h_sb])-([eq : m : x_jm ] ) , @xmath71 where the projection operator is defined as @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are the eigenvectors of @xmath74 .",
    "the exponent in ( [ eq : os : adiabaticsolution ] ) consists of the real part , which leads to decay of off - diagonal density - matrix elements resulting in decoherence , @xmath75\\ , , \\ ] ] and the imaginary part , which describes the coherent evolution , @xmath76 here we defined the standard spectral functions@xcite @xmath77 and @xmath78 calculating the sums by converting them to integrals over the bath - mode frequencies @xmath79 in ( [ eq : os : decoherencefunction - rel ] ) and ( [ eq : os : decoherencefunction - iml ] ) , assuming the ohmic bath with @xmath80 , for @xmath81 one obtains a linear in time , @xmath82 , large - time behavior for both the temperature - dependent real part and for the imaginary part .",
    "the coefficient for the former is @xmath83 , whereas for the latter it is @xmath84 . for the super - ohmic models , @xmath85 , the real part grows slower , as was also noted in the literature.@xcite    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     ' '' ''    let us estimate the development of entanglement for the p - in - si case , considering only the bath - induced effects .",
    "taking @xmath86 as the initial state , one expects entanglement to develop due to the @xmath87 interaction term .",
    "the corresponding coupling constant is @xmath88s@xmath89 . at distances of about @xmath90",
    "this part of the interaction can be already well approximated by @xmath91s@xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 components of the interaction are smaller by a factor @xmath92 and will not be considered",
    ". the pure state would then be developing as @xmath93 . at times",
    "@xmath94 , the maximally entangled ( bell ) states are obtained , with the first occurring at @xmath95s , and then at intervals of @xmath96s .",
    "the actual entanglement is lowered by ( i ) the short - time ( adiabatic ) decoherence term , ( ii ) the large - time relaxation amplitudes ( rates ) . the latter are due to the @xmath97 components of the qubit - bath coupling and are of order @xmath98s@xmath89 . as a result",
    "the first peak of the concurrence is lowered by a factor of @xmath99 , and the subsequent peaks decrease by @xmath100 per each cycle .",
    "we have studied the induced indirect exchange interaction due to a bosonic bath which also introduces quantum noise . at certain time",
    "scales the induced two - qubit interaction is sufficiently strong to produce significant coherent effects .",
    "this interaction can be a factor to be considered in designs of solid state ( as well as ion - trap based ) qubit registers .",
    "even more importantly , the fact that noise - inducing environment can also yield coherent features in the dynamics of open quantum systems poses several interesting fundamental challenges .",
    "the usual approach to thermalization@xcite has been to assume that , for large enough times , the time evolution of the system plus bath is not just covered by the combined hamiltonian , but is supplemented by the instantaneous loss - of - memory ( markovian ) approximation , which introduces irreversibility and imposes the bath temperature on the reduced system dynamics in the infinite - time limit , which is then approached as the density matrix elements assume their thermal values , according to @xmath101 with exponential relaxation ( diagonal ) and decoherence ( off - diagonal ) rates defining the time scales @xmath102 . however , it turns out that the traditional phenomenological no - memory approximations , yielding thermalization , the fermi golden rule for the transition rates , etc .",
    ", assume in a way too strong a memory loss : they erase the possible bath contributions to the coherent part of the dynamics at shorter times , such as the lamb shift for a single system as well as the induced rkky interactions for a bi - partite system .",
    "indeed , while relaxation leading to ( [ eq : dis : sth ] ) is driven by the `` on - shell '' exchanges with the bath , it is the memory of ( correlation , entanglement with ) the bath modes that drives , via virtual exchanges , the induced interaction .",
    "actually , the `` on - shell '' condition , imposed by the so - called secular approximation,@xcite also underestimates additional decoherence at short times@xmath103@xmath103the `` pure '' or `` adiabatic '' contribution to the off - diagonal dephasing@xmath103@xmath103that has thus been estimated by using other approaches.@xcite    perhaps the simplest way to recognize the ambiguity is to ask if the hamiltonian in ( [ eq : dis : sth ] ) should have included the bath - induced interaction terms ( not shown ) ?",
    "should the final boltzmann distribution correspond to the energy levels / basis states of the original `` bare '' system or the one with the rkky - interaction / lamb shifts , and more generally , a bath - renormalized , `` dressed '' system ?    there is presently no consistent treatment that will address in a satisfactory way all the expected _ physics _ of the bath - mode effects on the dynamics .",
    "the issue is partly technical , because we are after a _ tractable _ , rather than just a `` foundational '' answer .",
    "it is well accepted that the emergence of irreversibility can not be fully treated within tractable and calculationally convenient approaches derived directly from the microscopic dynamics : phenomenology has to be appealed to . however , even allowing for phenomenological solutions , most of the known tractable markovian - approximation - involving schemes that allow for the emergence of the indirect exchange interaction , treat thermalization in a cavalier way , yielding typically the noise term corresponding to @xmath2-dependent relaxation , but in the strict @xmath104 limit resulting in the completely random ( @xmath105 ) density matrix ( proportional to the unit operator ) .",
    "this then avoids the issue of which @xmath106 should enter in ( [ eq : dis : sth ] ) . and , as mentioned , the established schemes that yield a more realistic , thermalized density matrix at @xmath107 , lose some intermediate- and short - time dynamical effects .",
    "thus , we have discussed the challenges in formulating unified treatments that will cover all the ( or just most of the interesting ) dynamical effects , over several time scales , from short to intermediate times ( for induced interaction effects and pure decoherence ) to large times ( for the onset of thermalization ) , while providing a tractable calculational ( usually perturbative , many - body ) scheme .",
    "this discussion also alludes to several other interesting conceptual challenges in the theory of open quantum systems .",
    "let us presently comment on the issue of the bath - mode interactions with each other , as well as with impurities , the latter particularly important and experimentally relevant@xcite for conduction electrons as carriers of the indirect - exchange interaction .",
    "indeed , the traditional treatment of open quantum systems has assumed noninteracting bath modes .",
    "when the bath mode interactions had to be accounted for , the added effects were treated either perturbatively,@xcite or , for strong interaction , such as luttinger - liquid electrons in a 1d channel , the collective excitations were taken@xcite as the new `` bath modes . '' generally , however , especially in markovian schemes , one has to seek approaches that do not involve certain double - counting .",
    "indeed , the assumption that the bath modes are at a fixed temperature , could be possibly considered as partially accounting for the effects of the mode - mode and mode - impurity interactions , because these interactions can contribute to thermalization of the bath , on par with other influences external to the bath .",
    "this may be particularly relevant for phonons that always have strong anharmonicity for any real material . in a way this problem fits with the previous one",
    ": we are dealing with effects that can be , on one hand , modeled by added terms in the total hamiltonian but on the other hand , may be also mixed in the process of thermalization that is modeled by actually departing from the hamiltonian description and replacing it with liouville equations that include noise effects .",
    "while all this sounds somewhat `` foundational , '' recent experimental advances , interestingly , bring these challenges to the level of application that requires tractable , albeit perhaps phenomenological solutions that can be directly confronted with experimental data .",
    "there are other interesting topics to be considered , for instance , the question of whether additional sources of quantum noise are possible ?",
    "for instance , it has been recently established@xcite that potential difference between two leads ( reservoirs , or baths , of electrons ) can be a source of quantum noise with the potential difference playing the role of the temperature parameter .",
    "as an example of a more practical issue to be investigated , let us mention the possible effect of the sample geometry on phonon and conduction electron induced relaxation and interactions .",
    "the one - dimensional aspect of the electron gas in a channel has already been explored.@xcite indeed , electrons are easy to confine by gate potentials .",
    "the situation for phonons , however , is less clear : can geometrical effects modify , and particularly reduce , their quantum - noise generation capacity , or change the induced interactions ? our preliminary studies reviewed in this article , seem to indicate strong overall geometry dependence of the exchange interactions .",
    "however , the situation is not entirely clear , especially for the strength of the noise effects , and requires a full scale exploration because recent experiments with double dot nanostructures in si membranes@xcite suggest that true nanosize confinement ( due to the sample dimensions ) of otherwise long - wavelength modes ( in the transverse sample dimensions ) is now possible and will have dramatic effect on the phonon spectrum and , as a result , on those physical phenomena that depend on the phonon interactions with electron spins ."
