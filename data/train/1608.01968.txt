    "commensurate approximations to an incommensurate system are computationally expensive , and their approximation error is unclear . here we introduce a new method for computing a class of observables derived from the density of states for multi - layer incommensurate heterostructures _ without _ requiring an artificial strain in the system .    to approximate an observable of an infinite incommensurate system , we approximate local lattice site contributions to the observable .",
    "we observe that a site is uniquely defined by its local geometry .",
    "using an equidistribution theorem , there is a predictable distribution of local geometries , and hence site contributions .",
    "consequently , we can express observables in incommensurate heterostructures in terms of an integral over a unit cell , in a fashion rather similar to bloch theory .",

    "to parameterize the local geometries , we define the modulation operator @xmath14 on sheet @xmath5 for position @xmath15 : @xmath16 then the relative shift of site @xmath17 is @xmath18 ( see figure [ fig : bshift ] ) .",
