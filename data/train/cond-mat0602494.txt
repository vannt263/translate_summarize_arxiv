    "since born and von krmn , the construction of microscopic elastic models of crystals has formed an important part of solid - state physics , aimed to determine elastic constants and lattice dynamical properties ( born & von krmn 1912 ; born 1914 ) . imposing global translational and rotational invariance is a delicate matter , although the required relationship are well established ( born & huang 1954 ) .",
    "in fact , inconsistencies associated with rotational invariance in the earlier models were pointed out by lax ( 1965 ) and keating ( 1966@xmath0 ) .",
    "more recently , the importance of triangular lattices has emerged with the study of soft matter systems such as percolating gels ( feng & sen 1984 ; schwartz _ et al . _ 1985 ; arbabi & sahimi 1993 ) , membrane with crystalline order ( kantor & nelson 1987 ; seung & nelson 1988 ; gompper & kroll 1997 ) , biological membranes ( discher _ et al_.  1997 ; coughlin & stamenovic 2003 ) , red blood cell cytoskeleton ( saxton 1990 ; lim _ et al_.  2002 ; marcelli _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) , and finite element modeling ( gusev 2004 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a triangular lattice embedded in three dimensions and we determine the most general expression of the harmonic elastic energy up to next - nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "we formulate a systematic procedure to generate all the energy terms allowed by symmetry .",
    "this procedure could be applied to other type of lattices .",
    "we show that in order to correctly ensure rotational invariance , it is necessary to consider the boundary of the lattice , as first suggested by lax ( 1965 ) .",
    "our central result , equation  ( [ fk ] ) , gives _ all _ the allowed energy terms , with no particular connection to mechanical elements such as springs , elastic wedges , etc .",
    "this contrasts with the above cited papers that postulate energy terms in a non exhaustive way .",
    "in particular , the most general energy contains a non - central nearest neighbour term ( with coefficient @xmath1 ) , which was believed to violate rotational invariance in percolating gels ( feng & sen 1984 ) on the grounds of keating s argumentation ( 1966@xmath0 ) .",
    "the situation is actually delicate since in a later paper , keating ( 1968 ) restricted the generality of some assertions of its earlier papers .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "2 we formulate the elastic energy of triangular lattices . in  2@xmath2 , we write down all the scalar energy terms quadratic in the displacements of the lattice vertices . in  2@xmath3 ,",
    "we retain only the terms satisfying the six - fold symmetry of an infinite triangular lattice . in  2@xmath4 , we consider also the edges : we study the symmetries relative to them and we retain the allowed edge terms . in  2@xmath5 , we impose global translational and rotational invariance , taking explicitely into account the reduced symmetry of the boundary , and we retain the allowed terms . in  2@xmath6 , we collect all the contributions and we extract the resulting bulk terms . in  3 , we analyse and discuss the results obtained in  2 . in  3@xmath2 , we give a possible interpretation of our energy in terms of mechanical elements . in ",
    "3@xmath3 , we rewrite the energy into the generic expression ( [ fk ] ) , which constitutes our central result . in  3@xmath4 , we establish the connection between our model and its continuum version .",
    "finally , in  4 , we give a brief summary and we detail the origin of the rotational invariance problem .",
    "let us consider a bounded triangular lattice . in its undistorted state",
    ", we assume that it lies in a plane @xmath7 and that its vertices ( i.e.  its sites ) are evenly separated by a distance  @xmath8 ( figure  [ notations ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the position of a generic vertex  @xmath10 .",
    "we also assume that the elastic properties of the lattice are symmetric with respect to  @xmath7 .    in an arbitrary distorted state",
    ", @xmath11 becomes @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a three - dimensional displacement .",
    "the most general quadratic expansion of the lattice elastic energy , @xmath14 , is given by @xmath15 in this expression , we have separated the terms coupling identical vertices from those coupling different vertices .",
    "we have excluded the terms linear in @xmath13 , because they must vanish for the undistorted state to be a minimum of the energy .",
    "since @xmath14 is scalar , the tensors @xmath16 and @xmath17 must satisfy @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the superscript t means transpose .",
    "note that in general @xmath20 .",
    "we fix the _ interaction range _ by assuming that all the @xmath17 vanish except when @xmath10 and @xmath21 are nearest or next - nearest neighbours .      to begin with , we consider the _ bulk _ vertices , i.e. the vertices that are far away enough from the boundary ( this point will be precised in  2@xmath22 ) so that the triangular symmetry may be assumed . in the bulk",
    "the elastic properties are assumed to be spatially homogeneous .",
    "let @xmath23 be a unitary vector normal to @xmath7 .",
    "let ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) be two three - dimensional vectors forming a _ local _ orthonormal basis in @xmath7 , allowed to vary from site to site . the tensors @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be decomposed into the complete basis @xmath26 , where the symbol @xmath27 represent the tensorial product .",
    "elements linear in @xmath23 , such as @xmath28 , have been excluded , since the undistorted lattice is symmetric with respect to @xmath7 .    to construct @xmath16",
    ", we take @xmath24 along any one of the six nearest - neighbour directions of the undistorted lattice , and @xmath29 . because of the triangular symmetry",
    ", each term in the decomposition of @xmath16 must be even in @xmath24 and in @xmath25 , and the coefficients of @xmath30 and @xmath31 must be equal ( this condition is necessary for @xmath16 to be invariant under an in - plane @xmath32 rotation ) .",
    "hence , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the identity tensor in the plane @xmath7 . by virtue of the lattice homogeneity , the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 should not depend on @xmath10 .",
    "we now construct @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the unit vector in the direction going from @xmath11 to @xmath38 .",
    "we take @xmath39 and @xmath29 . without loss of generality the decomposition of @xmath17 over @xmath40",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath41 by virtue of the lattice homogeneity , the coefficients @xmath42 take only two sets of values : either @xmath43 if @xmath10 and @xmath21 are nearest neighbours , or @xmath44 if @xmath10 and @xmath21 are next - nearest neighbours .",
    "the in - plane mirror symmetry with respect to @xmath37 requires that @xmath17 must be even in @xmath25 , which leads to @xmath45      we now anticipate that we shall clearly distinguish between the @xmath16 and @xmath17 belonging to the bulk and those belonging to the edges . denoting by @xmath46 the part of the energy @xmath14 which involves only the _ bulk _ terms , we arrive , from equation  ( [ fgen ] ) , ( [ s ] ) , ( [ ageneral ] ) and ( [ ageneral - bis ] ) , at @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\ \\!\\!&+&\\!\\!\\sum_{<\\alpha\\beta>}^\\text{(bulk)}\\sum_{i={1}}^{2 } \\delta^{\\alpha\\beta}_i \\left[a_i\\,\\bm{u}^\\alpha_\\perp\\cdot\\bm{u}^\\beta_\\perp + \\tilde{a}_i\\,u^\\alpha_n\\,u^\\beta_n + \\bar{a}_i\\,(\\bm{u}^\\alpha_\\perp\\cdot\\bm{t}^{\\alpha\\beta})\\ , ( \\bm{u}^\\beta_\\perp\\cdot\\bm{t}^{\\alpha\\beta})\\right]\\!,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 denotes the normal component of @xmath13 and @xmath49 the projection of @xmath13 on @xmath7 .",
    "the symbol @xmath50 indicates the summation over both nearest and next - nearest neighbour pairs of vertices .",
    "as already mentioned , we assign to the former the suffix @xmath51 and to the latter the suffix @xmath52 ( see figure  [ clusters ] where these numbers are indicated as i and ii ) .",
    "the function @xmath53 takes the value @xmath54 if the pair \\{@xmath10 , @xmath21 } is of type @xmath55 and zero otherwise",
    ". we shall hereafter call such functions _",
    "indicatrix functions_.      with arbitrary coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , the energy form ( [ favantrans ] ) is not invariant under a global translation or rotation of the lattice . in order to correctly ensure rotational invariance ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account the _ edges _ of the lattice .",
    "this seems counterintuitive , because one expects the contribution of the edges to be subdominant with respect to the expensive contribution of the bulk .",
    "however , as it will more precisely be shown in  4 , this is not the case , because in a rotation the displacements of the edges are proportional to the size of the system .",
    "since our interest lies in the bulk terms , we choose the simple shape of a regular hexagon of edge length @xmath59 ( figure  [ notations ] ) as our system . consistently with the energy expansion",
    ", the specificity of the edges must be taken into account up to the next - nearest neighbour distance .",
    "for this purpose , we group the vertices into _ neighbour clusters _ in which all the inter - distances are at most equal to the next - nearest neighbour distance ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "there are seven types of such clusters , which we label from i to vii ( see figure  [ clusters ] ) .",
    "a vertex is said to participate in a neighbour cluster of type y if it can be grouped with its neighbour vertices into a neighbour cluster of type y. note that vertices near the edges participate in a smaller number of neighbour clusters than those in the bulk , because of their lacking neighbours .    to each vertex @xmath10 we now assign a _ type _ depending on which neighbour clusters it participates in : two vertices are assigned the same type if , and only if , their positions within the set of neighbour cluster in which they participate are indistinguishable .",
    "close inspection shows that the edge vertices are classified into five types , labeled from 1 to 5 , as shown in figure  [ bords ] .",
    "the vertices of type 1 are the bulk vertices .",
    "we apply a similar procedure to assign a type to the oriented nearest and next - nearest neighbour vertex pairs , which we call _ vertex doublets_. we distinguish the vertex doublets @xmath61 from @xmath62 since generally @xmath20 .",
    "two vertex doublets are assigned the same type if , and only if , their positions and orientations within the set of neighbour clusters in which they participate are indistinguishable .",
    "we thus determine eight types of vertex doublets , labeled from 1 to 8 ( figure  [ bords ] ) .",
    "the vertex doublets of type 1 are the bulk nearest - neighbour vertex doublets and those of type 2 are the bulk next - nearest neighbour vertex doublets . we also define types for the vertex _ pairs _ in the following way . when the two doublets associated with a given pair are of the same type , the pair is assigned that type ( this holds for the types @xmath63 ) while the pairs corresponding to doublet types 3 and 7 are assigned the type 3 and those corresponding to doublet types 4 and 8 are assigned the type 4 .      in order to take into account the local symmetry up to the next - nearest neighbour distance , we consider the _ symmetries of the set of neighbour clusters _ in which the vertices or vertex doublets participate .",
    "let us first examine the coefficients of the tensors @xmath16 for vertices of type 2 to 5 ( edge vertices ) .",
    "since each one possesses an axis of symmetry , we choose @xmath24 along this axis and @xmath64 as indicated in figure  [ bords ] .",
    "then , as @xmath16 must be even in @xmath25 , we arrive at @xmath65 where @xmath66 may either @xmath24 or @xmath25 . for definiteness",
    ", we choose @xmath67 for vertices of type 2 or 4 and @xmath68 for vertices of type 3 or 5 .",
    "we now construct the tensor @xmath17 for the vertex doublets of type 3 to 8 ( edge types ) .",
    "the most general expression for @xmath17 is given by an expression similar to ( [ ageneral ] ) : @xmath69 we choose @xmath39 and @xmath25 as indicated in figure  [ bords ] .",
    "the vertex doublets of types 4 and 8 have a mirror symmetry with respect to @xmath24 , hence @xmath17 must be even in @xmath25 , which implies @xmath70 .",
    "other relationships can be obtained by comparing the coefficients of @xmath17 and those of @xmath71 .",
    "first , note that @xmath19 implies @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . then , since the vertex doublets of type 5 and 6 do not change type when exchanging @xmath10 and @xmath21 , their coefficients must satisfy @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",
    "therefore @xmath78 for types 5 and 6 .",
    "finally , we find @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in the following ,",
    "we define @xmath83 as the tensor that performs a counterclockwise @xmath84 rotation in the plane @xmath7 ; depending on the relative orientations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath85 is either equal to @xmath83 or to @xmath86 .",
    "note that in general , we do find @xmath20 , contrary to what is the case in the bulk .",
    "the total elastic energy can now be written as @xmath87 , with @xmath88 given by ( [ favantrans ] ) and @xmath89 obtained by collecting the edge terms defined above .",

    "the third line in ( [ fedgeavantrans ] ) requires more explanations .",

    "consequently , only five combinations of the elastic parameters given for instance in figure  [ ressorts ] are measurable .",
    "we have also found that only three coefficients survive in the large scale limit , the lam coefficients and the bending modulus ; therefore our discrete description introduces two new elastic coefficients . from the following",

    "one of the main issue in the paper was the necessity to take into account the boundary elastic energy in order to correctly impose rotational invariance .",
    "this is well exemplified by the following energy term , which represents the sum of the energies of the angular springs between nearest bonds : @xmath237 where @xmath55 runs over all the pairs of adjacent bonds , making an angle @xmath238 , and @xmath239 runs over the interior bonds when @xmath240 is indicated , or over the boundary bonds when @xmath241 is indicated . in the last sum , the bonds ( @xmath242 ) must be taken counterclockwise . indeed ,",

    "the method developed in this paper  which consists in defining neighbour clusters based on the interaction range , in considering explicitely the edges of the lattice , in considering the local symmetries defined in terms of cluster environment to distinguish the various edge terms , etc.provides a safe basis to further implement rotational invariance .",
