    "<S> it is shown that for magnetic materials the role of hypothetical patch potentials is opposite to that required for reconciliation of the data with the drude model .    the casimir effect @xcite is of much interest due to its promising multidisciplinary applications in nanotechnology , condensed matter physics , physics of elementary particles , and in gravitation and cosmology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many experiments on measuring the casimir force between boundary surfaces made of different materials separated by a vacuum gap or a liquid have been performed in the last 15 years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the magnitude of the casimir force can be controlled by using different boundary materials @xcite , phase transitions @xcite , and by using the boundary surfaces structured with nanoscale corrugations @xcite .    a unified description of both the van der waals and casimir forces is given by the lifshitz theory @xcite in terms of the dielectric permittivity @xmath0 and magnetic permeability @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the role of magnetic materials in the casimir force has been studied theoretically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interest stems from the possibility to obtain a repulsive casimir force for application in micromachines . </S>",
    "<S> using real magnetic materials @xcite did not validate the early results which used constant @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath4 can be large only at @xmath5hz , its entire contribution to the lifshitz formula is through the zero matsubara frequency @xcite . for metals , </S>",
    "<S> the zero - frequency term is strongly influenced by the inclusion ( drude model approach ) or neglect ( plasma model approach ) of the relaxation properties of free electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus using @xmath3 provides another parameter to study the role of the relaxation properties of free electrons in the casimir effect . </S>",
    "<S> some experiments demonstrate strong disagreement between the measured data and theoretical predictions when the relaxation properties of electrons are taken into account for metals @xcite or the dc conductivity is included for dielectrics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same data are found to be consistent with theory when the relaxation properties are neglected for metals or the dc conductivity of dielectrics is disregarded . </S>",

    "<S> we describe demonstration of the casimir force between surfaces of a plate and a sphere , both coated with ferromagnetic metal ni , performed by means of dynamic atomic force microscope ( afm ) using the frequency shift technique . </S>",
    "<S> the lifshitz theory was generalized for the case of magnetic bodies in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but till now was not unequivocally verified experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> note that measurements of the casimir interaction between an au - coated sphere and a ni - coated plate @xcite confirmed the influence of magnetic properties on the casimir force under an assumption that the plasma model approach is adequate ( for au interacting with ni the drude model approach is not sensitive to magnetic properties and leads to almost the same results as the plasma model approach @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of ni - ni test bodies used here is that the magnetic properties significantly affect the casimir force when both the plasma and drude model approaches are used leading to considerably different results @xcite . using this property </S>",
    "<S> , we have unequivocally confirmed that the magnetic properties influence the casimir force in accordance with predictions of the lifshitz theory . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is excellent with the plasma model approach , and the drude model approach is excluded by our data at a 95% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> we have also excluded any possible role of patch effects on the conclusions obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this opens opportunities for far - ranging applications of the magnetic casimir effect in nanotechnology including the realization of the casimir repulsion through a vacuum gap @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we have used the same apparatus and cantilever preparation as in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> a coating rate @xmath11 / s was used . </S>",
    "<S> both test bodies were cleaned using a multi - step procedure to remove any attached adsorbates ( both neutral and with net charge ) and debris ( see @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cantilever was clamped in a specially fabricated holder and placed inside the vacuum chamber that was capable of reaching a pressure of @xmath12torr by using mechanical , turbo and ion pumps . </S>",
    "<S> the ni - coated plate was fixed on the top of the piezo with double sided vacuum adhesive tape . </S>",

    "<S> the directly measured quantity was the change of resonant frequency of the periodically driven cantilever which was detected by a phase locked loop system @xcite ( see details for our setup in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> the driving frequency was kept near the resonance frequency of the cantilever to obtain the highest signal to noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance frequency was detected with an optical interferometer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to keep the interferometric cavity length between the top of the cantilever and the end of the fiber fixed , we used a piezo above the cantilever , which was controlled by a proportional - integral - derivative feedback loop . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath81 nm this allows the use of the multiplicative approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results are shown in figs .  2 and 3(a  d ) within different separation regions by the black and gray bands ( their widths are defined by the errors in the optical data ) for the drude and plasma model approaches , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that at separations considered the difference between the predictions of the drude and plasma models for @xmath82 is approximately proportional to @xmath83 . as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 , the drude model approach is excluded by the data at a 67% confidence level over the region from 223 to 420 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma model approach is in excellent agreement with the data . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 we plot the same data for @xmath82 , but with the total experimental errors determined at a 95% confidence level over the region from 223 to 350 nm ( in the inset the interval from 300 to 350 nm is shown on an enlarged scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> the errors at the 95% confidence level are obtained in a conservative way as the doubled errors found at the 67% confidence level @xcite . as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 , over the region from 223 to 350 nm the drude model approach is excluded even at a higher , 95% , confidence level . for @xmath14 from 420 to1000 nm both the plasma and drude model approaches are consistent with the data </S>",
    "<S> . it should be noted , however , that at large @xmath14 the data are not informative with respect to the two models . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at @xmath84 , 550 , 750 , and 1000 nm the total relative experimental error is equal to 6% , 20% , 100% , and 321% , respectively , whereas the respective differences between the predictions of the drude and plasma model approaches are equal to 8.5% , 10% , 12% , and 14% .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that according to the lifshitz theory the magnetic properties of ni in ni - ni system significantly influence the gradient of the casimir force in the framework of both theoretical approaches ( they increase @xmath82 when the drude model approach is used and decrease it if the plasma model approach is applied ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our measurements unequivocally demonstrate the influence of magnetic properties on the casimir force as is predicted by the lifshitz theory combined with the plasma model approach . </S>",
    "<S> of even greater importance is the fact that for two magnetic metals the lifshitz theory predicts @xmath85 where the drude and plasma model approaches are indicated by the indices d and p ( see figs . 3 and 4 where the black bands are above the gray ) </S>",
    "<S> this is opposite to the case of two nonmagnetic metals where @xmath86 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the inclusion of effect of patches in the calculation for two magnetic test bodies is in principle incapable to bring the data in agreement with the drude model approach because patches always lead to an additional attractive force . </S>",
    "<S> this proves that surface patches do not play any role in our experiments and confirms the model of patches @xcite which leads to a negligibly small effect @xcite .    in this experiment </S>",
    "<S> both interacting bodies are magnetic and consist of many domains . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is necessary to analyze possible contribution of magnetic forces into the measurement results . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by considering two parallel ni films of @xmath87 area and applying the general formulation of the proximity force approximation @xcite . for films </S>",
    "<S> more than 150 nm thickness the magnetization of each domain is perpendicular to the film surfaces , i.e. , has only the @xmath88-component equal to @xmath89 , where @xmath90 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization of the first ( 1 ) and the second ( 2 ) films can be described by a function of two variables @xmath91 . in order to obtain the pair of infinite films described by the periodic functions , we perform the periodic continuation of @xmath91 as odd function with the periods 2@xmath92 and @xmath93 and use the fourier series @xmath94 here , @xmath95 if the spontaneous magnetization is absent .    next , </S>",
    "<S> using the standard formalism developed in magnetic force microscopy @xcite , one can calculate the magnetic field created by one ni film and the magnetic force acting on the other film . keeping in mind that the magnetic force between a pair of domains belonging to different films can be both attractive and repulsive , and that these domains have different size and </S>",
    "<S> are randomly arranged , the resulting magnetic force on a sphere is equal to zero under the condition that the spontaneous magnetization of at least one film is zero . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is obtained for a film of infinitely large area . </S>",
    "<S> our ni film of @xmath96 area contains of about @xmath97 domains whose sizes are approximately equal to film thickness @xcite to minimize the magnetic energy . in this case a noncompensated gradient of the magnetic force is estimated to be less than @xmath98n / m , i.e. , a factor of 100 less than the experimental error .    to avoid the spontaneous magnetization of ni films </S>",
    "<S> , we made them sufficiently thick and screened the weak environmental magnetic field in our setup . </S>",
    "<S> if , however , there is some nonzero spontaneous magnetization of both films , the resulting gradient of the magnetic force acting on a sphere , although nonzero , is negligibly small . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the magnetic field near the center of a large film does not depend on @xmath88 for @xmath99 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , even for a fully magnetized film ( which is not the case for our setup ) the gradient of the magnetic force acting on a sphere in the region of experimental separations is much less than @xmath100n / m , i.e. , much less than the experimental error in the measurements of @xmath48 .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have experimentally demonstrated that the magnetic properties of ni influence the casimir interaction as predicted by the lifshitz theory combined with the plasma model approach . </S>",
    "<S> the drude model approach in application to magnetic metals is excluded at a 95% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that any hypothetical patch potential will only exacerbate the deviation from the drude model approach . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results allow realization of the casimir repulsion through a vacuum gap which could lead to many potential applications in nanotechnology . </S>"
