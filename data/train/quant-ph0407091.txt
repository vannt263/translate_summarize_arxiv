    "quantum computers @xcite are of enormous interest because of their ability to perform calculations which appear to be intractable on any conceivable classical computer .",
    "the leading technology for the implementation of quantum logic gates is liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , and nmr quantum computers @xcite have been used to implement a range of quantum algorithms , mostly notably shor s algorithm which was used to factor fifteen @xcite .",
    "unfortunately nmr devices have one great disadvantage : the small energy gap between the zeeman levels that are used as computational basis states means that direct cooling is not a practical method for obtaining a pure initial state .",
    "the most common way round this is to prepare a pseudopure state @xcite , whose behaviour is identical to that of a pure state up to a scaling factor , but this is not a good solution for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the efficiency of pseudopure state preparation falls off exponentially with the number of qubits in the quantum computer @xcite , which means that nmr devices can not be scaled up to useful sizes , and secondly the states used are provably separable@xcite , and so can not exhibit the phenomenon of entanglement .",
    "these problems are not inherent in nmr quantum computation , but arise from the use of pseudopure states prepared from high temperature thermal states .",
    "we have recently shown how high purity initial states can be prepared using _",
    "para_-hydrogen  techniques @xcite , and that these states can be used to perform the simplest quantum computation , deutsch s algorithm @xcite .",
    "similar results have been obtained by hbler _",
    "@xcite , albeit with a lower spin state purity . here",
    "we describe the use of a new molecular system which allows essentially pure initial states to be generated , and the implementation of grover s quantum search algorithm @xcite on our pure state computer .",
    "state initialization on demand is achieved by using a laser pulse to initiate a rapid chemical reaction , and is therefore both well controlled and time coherent with the nmr radiofrequency pulses .",
    "we prepare pure spin states using an effect called _ para_-hydrogen  induced polarization ( phip ) @xcite .",
    "the existence of the _ para _  isomer of dihydrogen , , is a consequence of the pauli principle , which requires the overall wavefunction to be antisymmetric with respect to exchange of the fermionic nuclei .",
    "it follows that  molecules in even rotational states , most notably the @xmath1 ground state , possess an antisymmetric nuclear spin wave function and correspond to nuclear spin singlets , termed _",
    "para_. thus if  is cooled to a temperature of in the presence of a paramagnetic catalyst then essentially pure _",
    "para_-hydrogen  will be obtained , with the singlet spin wavefunction @xmath2 corresponds to the ground state and @xmath3 to the excited state of a spin-1/2 particle .",
    "the _ para_-hydrogen  molecule can not be used directly for nmr quantum computing , due to its high symmetry , but this can be overcome by using a chemical reaction to prepare a new molecule , in which the two hydrogen atoms can be made distinct and can be separately addressed . for further details see @xcite .    in our previous work",
    "we have used the two hydride nuclei in , where dppe indicates 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane , as our nmr quantum computer .",
    "detailed analysis of this system shows that the spins are not prepared in an absolutely pure singlet state , but in a slightly mixed state , which can be easily converted to a werner state @xcite of the form @xmath4 with a spin - state purity of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "although this system is adequate for an initial proof of principle experiment , it is not ideally suited for quantum computing ; in particular its spin  spin relaxation time ( @xmath6 ) is uncomfortably short .",
    "we have , therefore , prepared a novel but closely related system , , where dpae indicates 1,2-bis(diphenylarsino)ethane .",
    "this system has a slightly longer spin  spin relaxation time ( @xmath7 ) , and has the further advantage that the initial state can be prepared with a purity indistinguishable from one ( the purity was measured using techniques described previously @xcite and was found to be @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus we describe our new system as a pure state nmr quantum computer .",
    "although our quantum computer starts in a pure state , it does not start in the state conventionally assumed for two qubit quantum computers , that is @xmath8 in the computational basis .",
    "it is , however , simple to convert our initial state to this form by using a disentangling circuit , such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disentangle ]",
    "grover s quantum search algorithm @xcite permits an efficient search for one of @xmath9 matching items within a search space of size @xmath10 .",
    "the algorithm is most conveniently described in terms of a binary function , with @xmath10 possible inputs of which @xmath9 _ satisfy _ the function , that is produce an output of @xmath11 .",
    "the function is assumed to be implemented by means of an _ oracle _ , which will produce values of the function for any given input , but does not permit any other method of analyzing the function .",
    "the best classical algorithm is simply to try inputs at random , and this will allow a satisfying input to be located in @xmath12 queries .",
    "by contrast , grover s quantum search allows a satisfying input to be located in @xmath13 queries .",
    "the simplest case occurs when @xmath14 and @xmath15 , in which case the satisfying input can be located in a single query , and this is the case we will concentrate on here .",
    "the key element in an implementation of grover s search is a quantum function evaluation oracle , @xmath16 , which performs the transformation @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 indicates a quantum register in a state corresponding to the input @xmath19 , and the function @xmath20 has values of @xmath21 or @xmath11 .",
    "typically @xmath19 is written in binary form , and @xmath18 is a set of qubits with values corresponding to successive bits of @xmath19 . a quantum circuit which can be used to locate one satisfying input from four using this oracle is shown in fig .  [ fig : grover ] .",
    "our two qubit system comprises the hydride nuclei in , where the hydride atoms are derived from _",
    "the precursor compound  was prepared from @xmath22 and dpae using techniques described previously @xcite . essentially pure _",
    "para_-hydrogen  was prepared at a temperature of using a charcoal - based catalyst , and was introduced into a nmr tube containing  dissolved in @xmath23-benzene .",
    "the nmr tube was then transferred into a spectrometer fitted with a / probe modified for _ in situ _",
    "photolysis @xcite .",
    "the spectrometer triggered a uv pulse of wavelength from an mpb technologies msx-250 pulsed xecl excimer laser , irradiating the active region of the nmr sample and producing the unstable species .",
    "intermediates of this type have been shown to react with hydrogen on the sub - microsecond timescale @xcite , which would in this case lead to the formation of .",
    "for further details see @xcite .",
    "the hydride resonances appear at and , with a frequency separation of @xmath24 , while the hydride @xmath25 coupling ( @xmath26 ) was .",
    "the transmitter frequency was placed exactly between the two resonance frequencies .",
    "the laser flash acts as an initialisation switch , generating the pure state @xmath27 on demand , which is subsequently used for the implementation .    the singlet state @xmath27 can be converted to the desired initial state @xmath8 using the nmr pulse sequence @xmath28 \\ ; 90_y \\ ; [ \\frac{1}{4j } ] \\ ; 180_x \\ ; [ \\frac{1}{4j } ] \\ ; 180_y \\ ; [ \\frac{1}{2\\delta } ] \\ ; 90_x\\ ] ] which has been described previously @xcite .",
    "this pulse sequence is composed of a series of hard rf pulses ( which excite both spins equally ) and periods of evolution under the background hamiltonian , indicated by enclosing the appropriate evolution time in brackets . following nmr conventions operations are applied from left to right .",
    "no selective pulses are used , but at two points equal and opposite @xmath29 rotations are applied to the two qubits .",
    "these were achieved by evolution under the zeeman hamiltonian at frequencies of , with evolution under the small @xmath25 coupling neglected over these short periods .",
    "nmr pulse sequences to implement the four possible functions @xmath20 with a single satisfying value can be developed in the same way and are shown below , where each function is identified by listing its satisfying input .",
    "@xmath30 \\ ; 90_{-x } \\ ; 90_y \\ ; 90_{-x } \\ ; [ \\frac{1}{4j } ] \\ ; 180_x\\\\ p_{01 } & \\equiv [ \\frac{1}{4j } ] \\ ; 180_x \\ ; [ \\frac{1}{4j } ] \\ ; [ \\frac{1}{2\\delta } ] \\ ; 180_x\\\\ p_{10 } & \\equiv [ \\frac{1}{2\\delta } ] \\ ; [ \\frac{1}{4j } ] \\ ; 180_x \\ ; [ \\frac{1}{4j } ] \\ ; 180_x\\\\ p_{11 } & \\equiv [ \\frac{1}{4j } ] \\ ; 180_x \\ ; [ \\frac{1}{4j } ] \\ ; 90_{-x } \\ ; 90_y \\ ; 90_{-x } \\end{split}\\label{eq : pf}\\ ] ] two of these functions require equal @xmath29 rotations to be applied to the two qubits , and these were achieved using composite @xmath29 pulses .",
    "the final element used in our pulse sequences is a gradient pulse , indicated by _",
    "crush_. this is a short period of evolution during which time the magnetic field is temporarily made spatially inhomogeneous , so that spins in different parts of the sample experience different larmor frequencies .",
    "these crush pulses were applied immediately before and after the grover circuit , at which points the qubits should be in eigenstates of the computational basis .",
    "these states do not evolve under magnetic fields , and should not be affected by the crush pulse , but most error terms which can arise will be dephased @xcite .    putting these elements together gives the final pulse sequence used to implement grover s search , @xmath31 where @xmath32 corresponds to one of the four pulse sequences shown in equation  [ eq : pf ] .",
    "the state of the spin system is analyzed by applying a hard @xmath33 pulse and observing the resulting nmr spectrum . with appropriate phasing the state of each qubit",
    "is then indicated by multiplets pointing upwards for @xmath34 or downwards for @xmath3 .",
    "a phase reference spectrum is easily obtained using the sequence @xmath35 and the experimental results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .    .",
    "the four lower spectra were acquired after implementing grover s search with the oracle set to each of the four functions in turn . ]",
    "these spectra show exactly the pattern expected : each computation ends with the system in one of the four basis states , and the final state corresponds with the satisfying input of the corresponding function .",
    "note that in this paper we have used the same conventions as in @xcite , where the first qubit occurs on the right hand side of the nmr spectrum ; this is the reverse of the convention used in @xcite .",
    "there are small imperfections visible in the spectra : in particular there are imbalances in the intensities of the two multiplets and of the two lines in each multiplet , and the overall signal intensity is lower in spectra obtained from quantum computations than in the phase reference spectrum . the imbalances can be ascribed to errors in the implementations of the logic gates , while the signal loss is largely a consequence of relaxation during the pulse sequences .",
    "the effects of relaxation are less marked in this study than in our previous implementation of deutsch s algorithm @xcite ; this partly reflects the longer relaxation times in our new spin system , but is also a consequence of the symmetry in the gates applied to each qubit in grover s algorithm .",
    "these results confirm that it is possible to use _",
