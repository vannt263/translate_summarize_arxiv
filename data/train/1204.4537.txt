    "the process of the decay @xmath0 is intensively investigating from experimental  @xcite as well as from theoretical  @xcite points of view . in these works",
    "phenomenological models with intermediate vector mesons @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 were used . in all these models",
    "arbitrary parameters was introduced and adjusted to fit experimental data .    on the other hand",
    "the similar processes @xmath5 in the extended nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite were described  @xcite .",
    "let us note that njl  @xcite model allows us to describe the number of tau lepton decays  @xcite . in this work the investigation of the @xmath6 decays",
    "is continued and the decay @xmath0 is calculated in the framework of the extended njl model which takes into account intermediate @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "the amplitude of the decay is described by the feynman diagrams given in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "these diagrams are similar to diagrams used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the process @xmath7 .",
    "contact    ( 200,100 )    rho    ( 200,100 )    the lagrangian of quark - meson interactions in the framework of the extended njl model was given in refs .",
    "therefore , in present work we give only the expression for the amplitude describing the decay @xmath0 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fermi coupling constant ; @xmath10 is the cosine of the cabibbo angle , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the @xmath13 and @xmath14 meson momenta .",
    "the @xmath15 term corresponds to the contribution given by the contact diagram and the diagram with an intermediate @xmath1 meson . using the factor for @xmath16 transition",
    ", we can get the expression that coincides with one given by the vector meson dominance model : @xmath17 where @xmath18 mev is the mass of @xmath1 meson and @xmath19 is its total decay width .",
    "the contribution of the amplitude with an intermediate @xmath3 meson reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 corresponds to the @xmath22 transition , it was defined in  @xcite .",
    "the vertex constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined from the extended njl model lagrangian  @xcite : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 the definitions of integrals @xmath32 was given in ref .",
    "@xcite was calculated in the @xmath33 approximation as it was done in more recent works  @xcite with 3-dimensional cut - off . ] using the same set of parameters and the approach to loop integral computation , we re - calculated the energy dependence of the @xmath34 process cross - section .",
    "here we get a better description of the experimental data with respect to our earlier result  @xcite obtained within the same model ( but with another treatment of the loop integrals and other parameter values ) .",
    "it allows us to get a better agreement with experimental data for @xmath35 cross - section , see fig .",
    "[ eepiomega ] .",
    "use this formulas we get values for the branching of the @xmath0 : @xmath36    in experimental work  @xcite the results of the fit cvc model is given . with the help of the formula given in  @xcite we can get a prediction for the spectral density , see fig .",
    "[ tauomegepi ] .",
    "the position of the peak in the njl prediction for the spectral density differs from the one seen in the data .",
    "first of all , this is because we took the standard value of the @xmath37  mev value , while the fit of the cleo data gives about @xmath38  mev .",
    "moreover , we did not take into account the contribution of the @xmath39 intermediate state .",
    "the latter is important for the spectral function at large @xmath40 values , while it is very much suppressed in the decay spectrum .",
    "from our model one can get parameters for the density and the form factor : @xmath41 @xmath42 the comparison of experimental and theoretical values for these parameters is presented in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    ".experimental and theoretical data . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tbl1 ]",
    "the presented calculation show that the extended njl model allows to describe the branching of the decay @xmath0 in a satisfactory agreement with experimental data without introduction of any additional arbitrary parameters .",
    "this fact distinguishes our model from phenomenological approaches used earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we note that cleo experimental  @xcite values for energy range from @xmath43 to @xmath44  gev do nt coincide with number of other experiments  @xcite and njl prediction .",
    "it may affect to values for @xmath45 mass and @xmath39 contribution given by fits  @xcite .    in future works we are going to describe within the same model the @xmath46 lepton decays with the creation of @xmath47 mesons .",
