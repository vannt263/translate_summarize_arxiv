    "a first step in the data processing is the automatic flagging of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) with the aoflagger @xcite .",
    "we slightly decreased the default flagging thresholds to avoid flagging good data as cas  a and cyg  a have flux densities @xmath13  jy in the observed frequency range .",

    "after flagging we averaged the data to 4  s time steps to reduce its size .",
    "the data were calibrated with the blackboard selfcal ( bbs ) software system @xcite .",
    "we used high - resolution 10 arcsec clean components models of cas  a ( fig.[f_cas_model ] ) and cyg  a ( mckean et al . in prep . ) for calibration .",
    "these models were obtained from previous lofar observations around 70  mhz .    as the observations are pointed towards the two brightest sources on the sky , either cas a or cyg a dominates the total signal on all baselines .",
    "we made a copy of the 4  s data and averaged further down from 512 to 1 channel per subband .",
    "we then obtained gain solutions for all four correlations with bbs on a 4  s timescale .",

    "the observations were carried out in the maxi - short configuration and doppler tracking was turned off .",
    "we observed in frequency switching mode with 10  s sampling and 6 simultaneous 1.25  mhz subbands ( ivc bands ) each having 2048 channels ( using re - circulation ) and 2 polarizations ( xx , yy ) .",
    "each subband is centered near an expected crrl line frequency and we observe 3 crrl lines per setup where each line is covered twice with a different central frequency setting ( typically offset by 0.3 - 0.4  mhz ) . in total",
    "we specified 8 spectral setups of 6 subbands and cover a total of 24 lines ( all 22 @xmath0 lines within the observed frequency range and 2 additional @xmath15 lines ) .",
    "each spectral setup observed 10 minutes on - source and then changed to the next setup and after the last setup is done we return to the first setup . this way we cycled the spectral setups through the full 12  h observation and created similar uv and time coverage for each subband .",
    "the total observing time per subband was about 1.5  h.    the first step in the data reduction was the automatic flagging of rfi with the aoflagger .",
    "a dedicated wsrt p - band flagging strategy was developed for this purpose .",
    "the data were then averaged down and calibrated with casa @xcite using the high resolution 10clean components model of cas  a ( fig.[f_cas_model ] ) .",

    "we then convolved all images from all subbands to a common resolution of 80@xmath3100  arcsec@xmath14 and created an image cube for each subband .      from the wsrt 300 - 390",

    "the crrl @xmath0 ( @xmath16n=1 ) lines are clearly visible in the individual spectra for both lofar and wsrt .",
    "we investigated the overlapping subbands containing crrls between the two lofar observations and we find that the line profile parameters agree within errors .",
    "we removed the edge channels from the spectra and fitted a low order polynomial to the line free channels to estimate the continuum .",
    "we then convert the spectra to optical depth units following @xcite .",
    "the typical spectral rms per channel , in optical depth units , are 5@xmath310@xmath17 , 6@xmath310@xmath17 and 4@xmath310@xmath17 for lofar 55 - 78 mhz , 33 - 57 mhz and wsrt respectively .",
    "the peak signal to noise for individual @xmath0 lines in the lofar spectra is typically 79 for the -47 component and 24 for the -38  km  s@xmath1 component .",
    "similarly for wsrt the typical peak signal to noise is about 5 for the -47 and 1.5 for the -38 component .",
    "we perform line spectra stacking to the obtain higher signal to noise line profiles necessary to measure the line optical depth and line full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of each of the velocity components .",
    "the initial stacking of line spectra was performed as described in @xcite .",
    "these stacked spectra contain on average 6 @xmath0 lines in the wsrt range and 10 to 20 stacked lines in the lba range ( table  [ t_alln ] ) . stacking these lines over small changes in n is allowed as we expect the rrls to change slowly and smoothly in the observed frequency ranges .",
    "the stacked wsrt spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ f_app_wsrt_substack ] and the line profiles are found to be gaussian .",
    "the three velocity components at -47 , -38 and 0  km  s@xmath1 are narrow enough and sufficiently separated that we can fit them well with individual gaussians .",

    "this latter spectrum is only used for our investigation of the gas ionization using the hydrogen lines in sect .",
    "[ s_ionisation ] .    for the lba spectra",
    "there is strong line broadening with decreasing frequency , as expected from the stark effect ( e.g. sect .",
    "[ s_line_width ] ) .",
    "this leads to significant line blending for the -47 and -38  km  s@xmath1 components .",
    "furthermore , this causes the line profiles to have voigt profiles instead of gaussian profiles .",
    "voigt profiles are characterized by broad line wings .",
    "these broad wings can be affected by residuals in the continuum as well as nearby lines , such as crrl @xmath15 ( @xmath16n=2 ) , @xmath18 ( @xmath16n=3 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath16n=4 ) lines . in order to obtain the best possible fit we performed a different stacking procedure to optimize the continuum baseline in the lba line spectra .",
    "this procedure is described in detail in salas et al .",
    "( in prep . ) and is similar to the procedure used by @xcite for their low - frequency crrl spectra .    here",
    "we shortly summarize the main aspects of this procedure .",
    "for each stack the spectra are first searched for crrl @xmath0 and @xmath15 lines that are unblended with other lines and unaffected by rfi and bandpass roll - off .",
    "these lines were then stacked and fitted with voigt profiles to create template line profiles .",
    "these profiles are subtracted from each ( unstacked ) line spectrum and the residual spectra are stacked to search and fit for the crrl @xmath18 lines .",
    "these @xmath18 lines are then also subtracted from the individual line spectra and one final stack is performed to search and fit for the @xmath19 lines and also remove those from the individual line spectra .",
    "the residual baseline in the individual line spectra , where all @xmath0 , @xmath15 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 lines have the been removed , are then baseline corrected by a polynomial of order 0 . using the baseline corrected spectra we repeated the stack of the lines .",
    "this procedure is repeated 5 times on the lba spectra by increasing the polynomial order by one in each step .",
    "finally , stacked spectra with only one kind of transition are obtained by removing the corresponding best fit voigt profiles from the individual spectra .",
    "the @xmath0 line spectra resulting from this procedure are shown in figs .",
    "[ f_app_lba_substack_1 ] and [ f_app_lba_substack_2 ] .",
    "the baseline corrected , stacked line spectra are then fitted with voigt profiles for each of the three velocity components .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ t_lba_cia ] .",
    "the line broadening continues to increase towards lower frequencies and below 40  mhz ( n=550 ) it is no longer possible to robustly disentangle the -47 and -38  km  s@xmath1 components .    in salas",
    "( in prep . )",
    "we have verified this baseline correction procedure with detailed simulated lofar spectra that have the same resolution and noise characteristics as our observations and are processed in the same manner . in the lba range studied here this baseline correction procedure provides only a minor improvement in our recovery of the line profiles .",
    "however , this procedure becomes increasingly important at frequencies below 33  mhz .",
    "this spectral line stacking procedure with baseline correction processing , as described above , is only used for the crrl stacks as it removes all unidentified line features .",
    "upperlimits to the undetected hrrls , table  [ t_lba_hrrl ] , are obtained from stacked spectra without these corrections applied .",
    "the wsrt spectra clearly show that there are at least 3 crrl velocity components in emission at -47 , -38 and 0  km  s@xmath1 relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , see figs .",
    "[ f_app_wsrt_substack ] and [ f_app_wsrt_full_stack ] .",

    "in addition the wsrt spectra also show evidence for the presence of a weak line near -55  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "it is most prominent at the highest frequency stack , but observed at the 3@xmath20 level in all stacks ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ f_app_wsrt_substack ] ) .",
    "a similar feature is not seen in hi absorption or co emission spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which makes it unlikely that it is associated with crrl from another cold cloud at this velocity .",
    "a more likely explanation is that this feature is associated with rrl emission from sulphur ( srrl ) and/or other elements at higher atomic numbers ( sometimes referred to as xrrl or zrrl ) from the -47  km  s@xmath1 cloud .    here",
    "we will focus on the crrl and hrrl emission from the -47 and -38  km  s@xmath1 velocity components that arise in clouds situated in the perseus arm .",
    "the -38 feature is rather broad and the wsrt spectra show tentative evidence that this feature may in fact consist of more than one component .",
    "this can also be seen in the assymetric line profiles of co emission @xcite and hi 21  cm absorption @xcite .",
    "in particular the co ( j=2 - 1 ) emission spectrum from @xcite and @xcite shows two emission peaks , one at -40 and one at -36  km  s@xmath1 . for our current analysis",
    "we will treat the -38 feature as a single component .",
    "the wsrt data also show the presence of hydrogen rrls ( hrrl ) .",
    "these lines are shifted by + 149.4  km  s@xmath1 in the stacked crrl spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ f_app_wsrt_full_stack ] ) .",
    "this difference corresponds exactly to the difference in rest frequencies between the crrl and hrrl lines .",
    "this is only the 2nd detection of hrrls along this line of sight and our detection is at a lower frequency than the first detection at 420  mhz by ( * ? ? ?",

    "this is the first interferometric detection and the first time that also the weaker -38  km  s@xmath1 component is detected . for the even weaker orion spur crrl component",
    "we did not detect the corresponding hrrls .",
    "if the hydrogen to carbon rrl ratio in the orion spur is similar to that in the perseus arm components then this non - detection reflects that even higher signal to noise measurements are necessary to detect the hrrls for the orion component .",
    "the hrrl line for the -47  km  s@xmath1 component has the same width as the corresponding crrl line , indicating that they both arise in the same gas .",
    "however , we notice that the hrrl line for the -38  km  s@xmath1 component has a significantly narrower width than the corresponding crrl line",
    ". this may constitute additional evidence that the -38  km  s@xmath1 crrl component consists of multiple velocity components and that the hrrls only trace part of this .",

    "[ s_line_width ] we will model this with collisional and radiation broadening . for n@xmath12550",

    "our -47 hrrl line is also narrower than the detection reported by ss10 , but not as much as for the -38 component .",
    "line broadening of rrls typically increases with increasing n , as discussed above , and this therefore does not explain the difference .",
    "the difference between our spectrum and ss10 is close to the noise level of the ss10 spectrum and their broader feature may be caused by a noise peak .",
    "deeper observations are necessary to investigate this further",
    ".    the hrrl velocity centroids in our wsrt spectrum , in the rest - frame for hydrogen , are at -47.4 and -38.6  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this agrees very well with the corresponding crrl lines and shows that both the carbon and hydrogen lines likely originate in the same clouds , see fig .",
    "[ f_wsrt_hcrrl_overlay ] .",
    "the line width of the crrl and hrrl lines agree well for the -47 component , but the same is not true for the -38 component where our hrrl feature is significantly narrower than the corresponding crrl feature ( fig .",
    "[ f_wsrt_hcrrl_overlay ] ) .",
    "this could indicate that only part of the -38 crrl emitting gas is traced by the corresponding hrrl line .",
    "low frequency hrrls can be used to trace the hydrogen ionization rates in the crrl emitting clouds , if they trace the same gas . for the -47 component this is possible and two methods",
    "have been proposed to derive the total hydrogen ionization rate from hrrl measurements .",
    "the first method , proposed by shaver ( 1976 ) , uses the ratio between the hi 21  cm and the hrrl integrated optical depths .",
    "it is important to use the integrated and not the peak optical depths here , as the hrrl emission at sufficiently low frequencies can be affected by line broadening due to the stark effect ( e.g. s16b ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the previous section we saw that the hi  21 cm absorption measurements are saturated and thus underestimate the true hi optical depth .",
    "this method therefore only provides an upperlimit to the ionization rate @xmath57(-47 )  @xmath5  5@xmath310@xmath58  s@xmath1 .    a second method to obtain @xmath57",
    "was first proposed by @xcite , later modified by @xcite and ss10 , and uses the ratio between the crrl and the hrrl integrated optical depths . for convenience",
    "we repeat the equation here ( as presented in ss10 ) ;    @xmath59    we use the b@xmath26 and @xmath28 values from s16a .",

    "the hrrl to crrl hydrogen ionization rate we derive for the -47 component is an order of magnitude lower than reported by ss10 .",
    "we find that this is entirely due to a difference in models used to compute the departure coefficients .",
    "we have also computed @xmath57(-47 ) from their n=250 measurement using our models and find that it is consistent with our measurement at n=267 .",
    "our hydrogen ionization rate for the -47 component is a factor of a few lower than the modeled cosmic ray ionization rate ( @xmath631@xmath310@xmath58  s@xmath1 ) and the euv plus x - ray ionization rate ( @xmath648@xmath310@xmath4  s@xmath1 ) at a galactocentric radius r@xmath65=10  kpc @xcite .",

    "@xcite furthermore points out that grain neutralization may lower the rrl derived ionization rates . in this case",
    "our rrl measurement would provide a firm lower limit to the actual ionization rate .    in the above calculation for @xmath57(-47 )",

    "this indicates that for the -47 component the crrl and hrrl do not trace the same gas . to determine whether any other hrrl model can fit the hrrl measurements we ran a full hrrl grid search with the same parameters as done for the crrls above .",
