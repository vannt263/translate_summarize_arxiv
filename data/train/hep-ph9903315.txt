    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the couplings of the gauge bosons and fermions are tightly constrained by the requirements of gauge symmetry . in the electroweak sector , for example , this leads to trilinear @xmath6 and quartic @xmath7 interactions between the gauge bosons @xmath8 with completely specified couplings .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking via the higgs mechanism gives rise to additional higgs  gauge boson interactions , again with specified couplings .",
    "+ the trilinear and quartic gauge boson couplings probe different aspects of the weak interactions .",
    "the trilinear couplings directly test the non - abelian gauge structure , and possible deviations from the sm forms have been extensively studied in the literature , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "experimental bounds have also been obtained @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the quartic couplings can be regarded as a more direct window on electroweak symmetry breaking , in particular to the scalar sector of the theory ( see for example @xcite ) or , more generally , on new physics which couples to electroweak bosons .",
    "+ in this respect it is quite possible that the quartic couplings deviate from their sm values while the triple gauge vertices do not . for example , if the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking does not reveal itself through the discovery of new particles such as the higgs boson , supersymmetric particles or technipions it is possible that anomalous quartic couplings could provide the first evidence of new physics in this sector of the electroweak theory @xcite . + high - energy colliders provide the natural environment for studying anomalous quartic couplings .",
    "the paradigm process is @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ( @xmath0 colliders ) or @xmath11 ( hadron - hadron colliders ) , where one of the feynman diagrams corresponds to @xmath12 . in this context",
    ", one may consider the quartic - coupling diagram(s ) as the signal , while the remaining diagrams constituting the background .",
    "the sensitivity of a given process to anomalous quartic couplings depends on the relative importance of these two types of contribution , as we shall see .",
    "+ in this study we shall focus on @xmath0 collisions , and quantify the dependence of various @xmath13 cross sections on the anomalous couplings . we shall consider in particular @xmath4 and @xmath14  gev , corresponding to lep2 and a future linear collider ( lc ) respectively .",
    "for obvious kinematic reasons , processes where at least one of the gauge bosons is a photon have the largest cross sections . indeed , @xmath6 production with @xmath15",
    "are kinematically forbidden at 200  gev and suppressed at 500  gev .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath1 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 production .",
    "each of these contains at least one type of quartic interaction . which involves no trilinear or quartic interactions .",
    "] + there have been several studies of this type reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "our aim is partly to complete as well as update these , and partly to assess the relative merits of the above - mentioned processes in providing information on the anomalous couplings .",
    "note that our primary interest is in the so - called ` genuine ' anomalous quartic couplings , i.e. those which give no contribution to the trilinear vertices .",
    "+ in the following section we review the various types of anomalous quartic coupling that might be expected in extensions of the sm . in section  3",
    "we present numerical studies illustrating the impact of the anomalous couplings on various @xmath6 cross sections . finally in section  4",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "the lowest dimension operators which lead to genuine quartic couplings where at least one photon is involved are of dimension 6 @xcite . a dimension 4 operator is not realised since a custodial @xmath18 symmetry",
    "is required to keep the @xmath19 parameter , @xmath20 , close to its measured sm value of 1 .",
    "thus the 4-dimensional operator _ 4 = - g^2 ( ) ( ) with [ wb ]",
    "= (    c ( w_^+ + w_^- ) + ( w_^+ - w_^- ) + w_^3 - b _    ) and w_^3 - b _ & = & _ w z _ + _ w a _ - ( -_w z _ + _ w a _ ) + & = &  . does not involve the photon field @xmath21 .",
    "the other possible 4-dimensional operator @xcite = -ie f^ w_^ w^ _ with f^&= & _ a _ - _ a _",
    "+ w_&= & _ _ - _ _ -g _ _ and [ wbsm ] _ = (    c ( w_^+ + w_^- ) + ( w_^+ - w_^- ) + _ w z _ +",
    "_ w a _    )  , generates trilinear couplings in addition to quartic ones and is therefore not ` genuine ' . in section 4",
    "we will briefly discuss the impact of possible non - zero anomalous trilinear couplings on our analysis .",
    "+ we are therefore left with several 6-dimensional operators .",
    "first the neutral and the charged lagrangians , both giving anomalous contributions to the @xmath22 vertex , with @xmath23 either being @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "[ l0 ] l_0 & = & - a_0 f^ f _ + & = & - a_0 + & & , [ lc ] l_c & = & - a_c f^ f _ + & = & - a_c + & &  . where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the photon momenta .",
    "+ since we are interested in the anomalous @xmath22 contribution we pick up the corresponding part of the lagrangian . to obtain the feynman rules for the corresponding vertex ( in agreement with @xcite ) we have to multiply by 2 for the two identical photons ( as well as for the @xmath28s in the case of @xmath29 ) and by @xmath30 for convention .",
    "+ finally , an anomalous @xmath31 vertex is obtained from the lagrangian [ ln ] l_n & = & - a_n _ ijk w_^(i ) w_^(j ) w^(k ) f^ + & = & - a_n ( p^ a^ - p^ a^ ) + & & ( - w^- _ p_^+ ( z w^+ ) + w_^+ p_^- ( z w^- ) + z _ p_^+ ( w^+ w^- ) .",

    "+ it follows from the feynman rules that any anomalous contribution is _ linear _ in the photon energy @xmath37 .",
    "this means that it is the hard tail of the photon energy distribution that is most affected by the anomalous contributions , but unfortunately the cross sections here are very small . in the following numerical studies we will impose a lower energy photon cut of @xmath38  gev .",
    "similarly , there is also no anomalous contribution to the initial state photon radiation , and so the effects are largest for centrally - produced photons .",
    "we therefore impose an additional cut of @xmath39 .",
    "+ a further consideration concerns the effects of beam polarisation .",
    "one of the ` background ' ( i.e. non - anomalous ) diagrams for @xmath40 production is where all three gauge bosons are attached to the electron line .",
    "such contributions can be suppressed by an appropriate choice of beam polarisation ( i.e. right - handed electrons ) thus enhancing the anomalous signal .",
    "we will illustrate this below .",
    "+ finally , the anomalous parameter @xmath41 that appears in all the above anomalous contributions has to be fixed . in practice ,",
    "@xmath41 can only be meaningfully specified in the context of a specific model for the new physics giving rise to the quartic couplings .",
    "one example is an excited @xmath42 scenario @xmath43 , where we would expect @xmath44 and @xmath45 to be related to the decay width for @xmath46 .",
    "however , in order to make our analysis independent of any such model , we choose to fix @xmath41 at a reference value of @xmath47 , following the conventions adopted in the literature .",
    "any other choice of @xmath41 ( e.g. @xmath48  tev ) results in a trivial rescaling of the anomalous parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "in this section we study the dependence of the cross sections on the three anomalous couplings defined in section  2 .",
    "as already stated , we apply a cut on the photon energy @xmath52  gev to take care of the infrared singularity , and a cut on the photon rapidity @xmath53 to avoid collinear singularities .",
    "we do not include any branching ratios or acceptance cuts on the decay products of the produced @xmath54 and @xmath28 bosons , since we assume that at @xmath0 colliders the efficiency for detecting these is high .",
    "+ we first consider the sm cross sections for the processes of interest , i.e. with all anomalous couplings set to zero .",
    "figure  [ total ] shows the collider energy dependence of the @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 cross sections .",
    "given in figure  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite . to cross check our results we used madgraph @xcite . ]",
    "next we study the influence of each of the three anomalous parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 separately in order to gauge the impact of each on the cross section .",
    "note that @xmath60 depends on all three parameters , while @xmath61 and @xmath62 depend only on @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ asubi ] shows the dependence of the three total cross sections of figure  [ total ] at @xmath5  gev on the anomalous parameters . in each case",
    "the cross section is normalised to its sm value , and the cuts are the same as in figure  [ total ] .    as expected",
    "the dependence on the @xmath45 is quadratic , since they appear linearly in the matrix element .",
    "the fact that the minimum of the curves is close to the sm point @xmath63 shows that the interference between the anomalous and standard parts of the matrix element is small .",
    "the anomalous parameters have a markedly different effect on the three cross sections .",
    "evidently @xmath49 has the largest influence , particularly on @xmath61 .",
    "the reason for this is easily understood .",
    "the anomalous process @xmath64 has a much larger impact on @xmath61 since there are only six other sm diagrams .",
    "in contrast , @xmath65 has a much larger sm ` background ' set of diagrams to contend with .",
    "note also that the anomalous contributions are enhanced by a factor @xmath66 compared to the @xmath67 vertex .",
    "+ of course the important question is which of the three processes offers the best chance of detecting an anomalous quartic coupling at a given collider energy . to answer this we need to combine the information from figs .",
    "[ total ] and [ asubi ] to see whether enhanced sensitivity can overcome a smaller overall event rate .",
    "we also need to consider _ correlations _ between different anomalous contributions to the same cross section .",
    "+ we consider two experimental scenarios : unpolarised @xmath68 collisions at @xmath69  gev with @xmath70  pb@xmath71 , and at @xmath14  gev with @xmath72  fb@xmath73year . starting with the @xmath1 process ,",
    "figure  [ ell200 ] shows the contours in the @xmath74 plane that correspond to @xmath75 deviations from the sm cross section at @xmath76  gev .",
    "note that there are three ellipses , one for each combination of the three anomalous couplings .",
    "evidently the sensitivity to @xmath49 and @xmath51 is comparable , corresponding to @xmath77 for this luminosity .",
    "the corresponding limit on @xmath50 is some three to four times larger .",
    "figure  [ ell500 ] shows the same contours but now at @xmath14  gev .",
    "the dramatic improvement in sensitivity ( now @xmath78 ) comes partly from the higher collision energy ( which allows for more energetic photons ) but mainly from the much higher luminosity .",
    "a correlation between the effects of @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( solid ellipses ) is noticeable at this energy .",
    "we have already anticipated a significant improvement in sensitivity for this process when the beams are polarised .",
    "specifically , with right - handed electrons ( and left - handed positrons ) we suppress a large number of sm ` background ' diagrams where the @xmath54 are attached to the fermion line .",
    "the effect of 100@xmath79 beam polarisation of this type is shown in figure  [ rell500 ] .",
    "assuming the _ same _ luminosity we obtain a factor of approximately 3 improvement in the sensitivity to an individual anomalous coupling .    turning to the sensitivity of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes , figure  [ com200 ]",
    "shows the sensitivity of the latter to @xmath49 and @xmath50 at @xmath4  gev with @xmath70  pb@xmath71 and unpolarised beams .",
    "gev ) @xmath61 is essentially zero at this collision energy . ] for comparison , we also show the corresponding @xmath1 contours from figure  [ ell200 ] .",
    "the @xmath3 process gives a significant improvement in sensitivity , particularly for @xmath50 .",
    "since the sm cross sections at this energy are comparable ( see figure  [ total ] ) , the improvement comes mainly from the enhanced sensitivity of the matrix element to the anomalous couplings in the @xmath3 case .",
    "finally , figure  [ com500 ] compares the sensitivity of all three processes to @xmath49 and @xmath50 at @xmath5  gev with @xmath80  fb@xmath71 and unpolarised beams .",
    "the best sensitivity is now provided by the @xmath2 process ( particularly for @xmath50 ) , despite the fact that it has the smallest cross section of all the three processes .",
    "note that polarising the beams has little effect on the sensitivity of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes to the anomalous couplings , since the left - handed and right - handed couplings of the @xmath28 to the electron are similar .",
    "we have investigated the sensitivity of the processes @xmath81 and @xmath3 to genuine anomalous quartic couplings @xmath82 at the canonical centre - of - mass energies @xmath83  gev ( lep2 ) and @xmath14  gev ( lc ) .",
    "key features in determining the sensitivity for a given process and collision energy , apart from the fundamental process dynamics , are the available photon energy @xmath37 , the ratio of anomalous diagrams to sm ` background ' diagrams , and the polarisation state of the weak bosons @xcite .",
    "+ at @xmath83  gev the process @xmath57 leads to the tightest bounds on the contour of @xmath84 , while the process @xmath55 is needed to set bounds also on @xmath51 . note that the contours of @xmath85 and @xmath86 can then be improved using the knowledge of the tighter bounds on the contour of @xmath84 from @xmath3 production . at this",
    "energy @xmath3 benefits kinematically from producing only one massive boson , which leaves more energy for the photons as well as having fewer ` background ' diagrams . on the other hand @xmath1 production at this energy suffers from the lack of phase space available for energetic photon emission , although this is partially compensated by the production of longitudinal bosons , which gives rise to higher sensitivity to the anomalous couplings .",
    "+ at @xmath87  gev , the effects mentioned above conspire in a somewhat different way .",
    "all three processes are now well above their threshold , and hence the availability of phase space for energetic photons is less of an issue .",
    "the importance of the longitudinal polarisation of the massive bosons increases and even though the same number of diagrams contributes to @xmath88 production as to @xmath3 production , far tighter bounds on the anomalous couplings can be expected from the former process .",
    "the production of longitudinally polarised bosons is comparable in the @xmath89 and @xmath88 processes , but the higher signal to background ratio for the latter leads to a better sensitivity to @xmath49 and @xmath50 . is still needed for investigating @xmath51 . ]",
    "+ the ability to polarise the beams leads to a significant improvement in the sensitivity of the @xmath1 process , since about a third of the contributing diagrams are removed . with polarised beams the",
    "tightest bounds now come from this process .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath90 process is hardly affected by beam polarisation .",
    "furthermore , for the typical ( large ) luminosities expected at future linear colliders @xcite the magnitude of the total cross section itself plays a less important role .",
    "+ the @xmath14  gev comparison emphasises the importance of the longitudinal polarisation states of the massive bosons ( @xmath88 and @xmath3 are more or less comparable otherwise ) .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath91 process should be more sensitive to anomalous couplings than @xmath92 , since all three final - state particles can be longitudinal polarised . with the expected linear collider luminosity",
    ", the somewhat smaller cross section should not be an issue , and the ratio of background to signal diagrams is the same as for @xmath1 production .",
    "unfortunately this process is only sensitive to @xmath51 . and",
    "@xmath50 couplings stem from the @xmath22 vertex . ] furthermore , since there is no photon in the final state 4-dimensional operators can also contribute to anomalous couplings ( i.e. an anomalous @xmath93 vertex ) and the analysis becomes significantly more complicated .",
    "+ finally it is important to emphasise that in our study we have only considered ` genuine ' quartic couplings from new six - dimensional operators .",
    "we have assumed that all other anomalous couplings are zero , including the trilinear ones .",
    "since the number of possible couplings and correlations is so large , it is in practice very difficult to do a combined analysis of _ all _ couplings simultaneously .",
    "in fact , it is not too difficult to think of new physics scenarios in which effects are only manifest in the quartic interactions .",
    "one example would be a very heavy excited w resonance produced and decaying as in @xmath43 .",
    "+ in principle , any non - zero trilinear coupling could affect the limits obtained on the quartic couplings .",
    "for example , in equation ( 4 ) we showed explicitly how a non - zero trilinear coupling ( @xmath94 ) can generate an anomalous @xmath95 quartic interaction to compete with the ` genuine ' ones that we have considered .",
    "the ( dimensionless ) strength of the former is @xmath96 , while for the latter it is @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the typical energy scales of the photons entering the vertex .",
    "( here we are considering , as a specific example , the @xmath55 process . ) since @xmath100 , @xmath101  gev and @xmath102/9 \\sim 190 $ ]  gev , both for @xmath83  gev , we see immediately that the relative contributions of the two types of couplings are in the approximate ratio @xmath103 .",
    "now , at lep2 upper limits on trilinear couplings like @xmath94 are already @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we have shown that the limits achievable on the @xmath45 are @xmath105 .",
    "hence we already know that the anomalous trilinear couplings have a minimal impact on our analysis .",
    "the same argument holds at higher collider energies .",
    "the limits on the trilinear couplings will always be so much smaller than those on the quartic couplings , that they can safely be ignored in studies of the latter .",
