    "<S> using the voros star product , we investigate the status of the two particle correlation function to study the possible extent to which the previously proposed violation of the pauli principle may impact at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> the results show interesting features which are not present in the computations made using the moyal star product .    0.2 cm * keywords * : noncomutative geometry + * pacs : * 11.10.nx    it is likely that at short distances spacetime has to be described by different geometrical structures and that the very concept of point and localizability may no longer be adequate . </S>",
    "<S> this is one of the main motivations for the introduction of noncommutative ( nc ) geometry @xcite-@xcite in physics . </S>",
    "<S> attempts have been made to formulate quantum mechanics @xcite-@xcite and quantum field theories @xcite-@xcite on nc spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the latter case , the issue of the lack of lorentz invariance symmetry has remained a challenge since field theories defined on a nc spacetime with the commutation relation of the coordinate operators @xmath0&= & i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu } \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a constant antisymmetric matrix , are obviously not lorentz invariant .    </S>",
    "<S> the twist approach to nc quantum field theory has been developed to circumvent this problem @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is triggered by the realization that it is possible to twist the coproduct of the universal envelope @xmath2 of the poincar algebra such that it is compatible with the star product .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting result that follows from the twisted implementation of the poincar group is that the bose and fermi commutation relations get deformed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is controversial though as a different point of view was presented in @xcite and the issue is not yet resolved . </S>",
    "<S> a further controversy involves the use of the moyal or voros twist , related to the use of the moyal or voros star product @xcite . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the point of view of @xcite and consider the effect of implementing the twist through the voros or moyal twist within a simple nonrelativistic setting .    </S>",
    "<S> a very striking consequence of these deformations is the violation of the pauli exclusion principle . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown that the two particle correlation function for a free fermion gas in @xmath3 dimensions ( with exclusively spatial noncommutativity , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) does not vanish in the limit @xmath6 which indicates that there is a finite probability that fermions may come very close to each other . </S>",
    "<S> the computation has been done by using twisted commutation relations among the creation and annihilation operators of the schrdinger field which in turn has been obtained by taking the non - relativistic limit of the analogous relations for the klein - gordon field . a key ingredient in the entire analysis has been the moyal twist element which reads @xmath7 where ( in two spatial dimensions ) @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the antisymmetric tensor of order two .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a comparison of nc field theories built on two different star products ( twist elements ) , namely the moyal and voros , have been made @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that although the green s functions are different for the two theories , the s - matrix is the same in both cases and is different from the commutative case . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates us to investigate the status of the two particle correlation function using deformed commutation relations obtained by incorporating the action of the voros twist element @xcite - deformed mass density of a spherically symmetric gravitational source @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 on the usual pointwise product between two fields .    to begin the analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we first write down the mode expansion of a free nonrelativistic quantum field @xmath11 of mass @xmath12 ( in units with @xmath13 ) in the nc plane as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 satisfy the usual ( anti)commutation relation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is @xmath19 for bosons and @xmath20 for fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation algebra involving @xmath16 has already been derived in @xcite for the relativistic case and can be readily shown to hold in the nonrelativistic case as well : @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now compute the two particle correlation function for a free gas in 2 + 1 dimensions using the canonical ensemble , i.e. , we are interested in the matrix elements @xmath24 , ( @xmath25 ) where @xmath26 is the canonical partition function and @xmath27 is the non - relativistic hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the physical meaning of this function is quite simple ; it tells us what the probability is to find particle two at position @xmath28 , given that particle one is at @xmath29 , i.e. , it measures two particle correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant two particle state is given by @xmath30 the two particle correlation function can therefore be written as @xmath31 where we have introduced a complete set of momentum eigenstates @xmath32 and @xmath26 is the partition function of the system .    using eq(s)([rh1 ] , [ deform_voros ] , [ commutation ] ) and noting that @xmath33 we get @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 implies complex conjugate of the second term in the above expression . substituting this in eq([rh2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the partition function of the system can now be readily computed and reads @xmath41 in the limit of the area of the system @xmath42 . substituting the above result in eq([rh4 ] ) , we finally obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mean thermal wavelength given by @xmath45 we quote the corresponding result in the moyal case @xcite in order to compare with the voros result obtained above ( [ probability ] ) : @xmath46    eq([probability ] ) shows many interesting features . note that there exists two thermal wavelengths @xmath47 and @xmath48 where the second term in the above expression vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> these wavelengths correspond to two temperatures @xmath49 and @xmath50 at which the correlation function is completely independent of whether the particles are bosons or fermions . for temperatures much less than @xmath51 the correlations exhibit mild deviations away from that of commutative bosons or fermions . </S>",
    "<S> however , for temperatures @xmath52 lying between @xmath51 and @xmath53 ( i.e. @xmath54 ) , the bosons start behaving as fermions and vice versa . these temperatures are of course extremely high . indeed , assuming @xmath55 to be of the order of the planck length squared and restoring @xmath56 one finds them to be of the order of @xmath57k . for temperatures </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 , the exponential in eq([probability ] ) becomes positive and correlation grow exponentially with distance . </S>",
    "<S> this signals the onset of instability , which can best be seen if one considers the exchange potential defined by @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> this becomes unstable or complex above this temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the existence of a high energy cut off @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> these features are completely absent when the computations are made using the moyal star product @xcite and are summarized in figures 1a , 1b , 2a and 2b , which shows the exchange potential for the moyal and voros twist in the case of bosons and fermions , respectively , for values of the dimensionless variable @xmath61 below @xmath51 ( @xmath62 ) and between @xmath51 and @xmath53 ( @xmath63 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 is measured in units of @xmath44 . for reference the commutative results ( @xmath65 ) </S>",
    "<S> are also shown in which case there is of course no distinction between moyal and voros . </S>",
    "<S> the transgression of statistics in the temperature range between @xmath51 and @xmath53 can clearly be seen . of course </S>",
    "<S> , if these temperatures are really as high as advertised here , the nonrelativistic limit would be invalid and the conclusions above will probably be modified in a proper relativistic description . </S>",
    "<S> however , the crucial point here is not so much the absolute values of @xmath55 and @xmath44 , but rather the existence of two length scales ( @xmath66 and @xmath44 ) , which is not the case in commutative theories , and the ( not unexpected ) non - trivial behaviour that occurs when these two length scales become comparable </S>",
    "<S> . this may be quantitatively different in a relativistic treatment , but generically one would again expect non - trivial behaviour when the two length scales are comparable . in effective noncommutative systems this may happen at much lower temperatures where the nonrelativistic approximation is valid .    </S>",
