    "in the strong interaction , one of the most stringent constraints on possible violation of parity ( p ) and time - reversal ( t ) symmetry comes from the measurement of the electric dipole moment ( edm ) for neutron ( nedm ) and proton ( pedm ) @xmath13 .",
    "the current upper bound is given by |d_n| < 6.310 ^ -26e for neutron@xcite , and |d_p| < 5.4 10 ^ -24e for proton@xcite , which are estimated from the results for edm of mercury atom @xmath14 given by @xmath15 @xcite    on the other hand , qcd , which is regarded as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , allows a gauge invariant , renormalizable cp odd operator in the lagrangian , called the @xmath0 term : & & id^4xg_(x)g_(x ) [ l_qcd ] , g_(x ) = _ g_(x ) in euclidean space - time with @xmath16 the field strength of gluon .",
    "some model estimations@xcite yield |d_n| ~o(10 ^ -15~10 ^ -16 ) e , and this leads to a bound @xmath17 . hence @xmath0 must be small or",
    "even must vanish in qcd .",
    "a smallness of @xmath0 in the qcd sector , however , is not protected in the presence of the electroweak sector of the standard model , where the quark mass matrix , arising from yukawa couplings to the higgs field , may be written as |^r_i(x ) m_ij^l_j(x ) + |^l_i(x ) m^_ij^r_j(x ) , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent left and right handed quark fields with flavor indices @xmath20 .",
    "diagonalizing the mass matrix and making it real , the parameter @xmath0 becomes = _ qcd + m , where @xmath21 is the original @xmath0 parameter in qcd .",
    "therefore , either @xmath21 and @xmath22 are individually small , or the two contributions cancel out to the degree that the experimental upper bound on nedm is satisfied . in either of the two cases , it seems necessary to explain why nature chooses such a small value for @xmath0 ; this is the `` strong cp problem '' .",
    "one of the most attractive explanations proposed so far is the peccei - quinn mechanism@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the axion , a new particle predicted by this mechanism , has not been experimentally observed yet .",
    "the present model estimations of the hadronic contribution to nedm , @xmath23 , are maybe enough to convince us of the the smallness of @xmath0@xcite .",
    "however , a theoretically reliable and accurate estimation for nedm will be required to determine the value of @xmath0 , if non - zero value of nedm is observed in future experiments .",
    "lattice qcd calculations seem ideal for this requirement . indeed more than 15 years ago the first attempt was made to estimate nedm in a quenched lattice qcd simulation@xcite by calculating the spin dependent energy difference of the nucleon in the presence of the uniform static electric field . in this simulation , the @xmath0",
    "was converted to the phase of the quark mass term by the chiral rotation , and a non - zero value of nedm was obtained for non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately this non - zero value of nedm turned out@xcite to be a lattice artifact due to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking of the wilson fermion action employed in the simulation ; if the @xmath0 term appears in the quark mass , an additional disconnected contribution must be included in the quenched calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "after this attempt , there has been no further lattice investigation on this problem for a long time .",
    "recently , a new lattice strategy @xcite for the extraction of nedm has been proposed , and a lattice related investigation on nedm has been made@xcite . also , a preliminary lattice qcd result of nedm estimated from the nucleon electromagnetic three - point function has been reported at the lattice 2004 conference@xcite .",
    "the value of nedm divided by @xmath0 is consistent with zero within statistical errors in this calculation , however . in all attempts , an expansion in @xmath0",
    "have been used to avoid the complex action due to the @xmath0 term .    since chiral symmetry seems important in the calculation of nedm@xcite , it may be preferable to use lattice fermion formulations having good chiral symmetry , such as the domain - wall fermion@xcite or the overlap fermion@xcite . in these formulations ,",
    "the bosonic definitions of the topological charge agree well with the fermionic definitions .",
    "in fact the domain - wall fermion was employed in ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new method to calculate nedm in lattice qcd .",
    "we consider the strategy of extracting nedm from the cp - odd part of the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleon , as in the recent lattice calculation @xcite as well as in some past model calculations @xcite .",
    "we first examine the @xmath0 dependence of the three - point ( two nucleons and the electromagnetic current ) function by expanding up to first order in @xmath0 under the assumption that @xmath0 has fairly small value .",
    "an important finding is that the parity - odd part of the three - point function contains a contribution coming from the parity - even form factors multiplied by the parity - odd part of the nucleon two - point function .",
    "this contribution has to be subtracted from the three - point function in order to properly extract the cp - odd form factor relevant for nedm .",
    "this point is not considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "we present the formula to extract the relevant form factor in terms of the nucleon two- and three - point functions , which is valid not only for lattice simulations but also for general cases as long as chiral symmetry of quarks is well formulated in the calculations .",
    "we test our formula in a lattice qcd simulation using the domain - wall fermion in the quenched approximation . a renormalization group ( rg ) improved gauge action",
    "is employed based on our experience that the residual chiral symmetry breaking due to a finite fifth dimensional extent is smaller than in the case for the plaquette gauge action at a similar lattice spacing@xcite . since our primary purpose is to check the feasibility of the lattice qcd calculation of nedm based on our formula , we focus on accumulating the statistics to obtain a sufficient sampling of topological charge on a @xmath6 lattice at @xmath5 gev with the quark mass of @xmath24 , corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "our numerical results reveal that the contribution to the three - point function from the parity - even form factors multiplied by the parity - odd part of the nucleon two - point function is really significant .",
