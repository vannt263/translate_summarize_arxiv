    "the flow of fluids through porous media is a classic problem which has many scientific and industrial applications . for very narrow pores , with diameters of the order of @xmath1 or less ,",
    "continuum descriptions become inapplicable and the transport of matter must be examined on the molecular scale .",
    "examples include molecular or ionic permeation of zeolites @xcite , of carbon nanotubes @xcite and of aquaporins @xcite and ion channels @xcite through cell membranes .",
    "the simple kinetic models examined in this work are meant to represent ion channels : they are , however , also more widely applicable - for example , we shall present results for ions flowing through an infinitely long pore that might represent a carbon nanotube or part of a zeolite .",
    "ion channels are pores through cell membranes , through which ions are transported under the influence of a concentration gradient and a large electric field .",
    "the permeability of the pores is highly selective for particular ions and the pores can also open and close to ion transport ( a phenomenon known as `` gating '' ) in response to factors such as ligand binding or changes in the electric field or the membrane tension .",
    "many channels contain a narrow region , the `` selectivity filter '' , where ionic motion is essentially single - file @xcite .",
    "some channels appear to transport only one ion at a time , while others use transport mechanisms involving multiple ions @xcite .",
    "measurements of the current through individual channels have been possible for some time , and these have resulted in a large amount of data , both on the gating characteristics of channels , and on their properties in the open state .",
    "these properties include the relationship between the ionic current and the electric field applied across the membrane ( current - voltage relations ) , as well as the conductivity of the channels as a function of the ionic concentration difference , at fixed applied voltage ( conductance - concentration relations ) .",
    "one of the challenges for theoreticians is to relate these functional characteristics to the geometric , physical and chemical structure of the pores , which are becoming increasingly well - known @xcite .",
    "this goal may be achieved by detailed simulations of the motion of ions and molecules through specific pores @xcite , or using simplified models @xcite .",
    "rates of ion transport can be predicted directly , or by application of barrier - crossing theories such as kramers rate theory @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is the extension of continuum theories to the nanoscale .",
    "goldman @xcite and hodgkin and katz @xcite(ghk ) , in their classic work , applied the one - dimensional diffusion equation in a constant electric field to predict current - voltage relations for ion channels .",
    "this work is generalized to specific and multi - dimensional ion channel models in the poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) theory of ion channels @xcite , where numerical solution methods are used to obtain the current due to diffusion in the presence of complicated and self - consistent potential fields .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of applying simple , analytically solvable , kinetic models to the problem of transport in nanopores .",
    "our approach is for the moment very general .",
    "we consider the motion of single ions through a one - dimensional pore of length @xmath0 connecting two reservoirs at different ion concentrations , under the action of a constant electric field ( we shall also consider the case of an infinitely long pore ) .",
    "ions are expected to experience friction due to collisions with the inside surface of the pore and with other particles , such as water molecules , inside the pore .",
    "we include this effect initially by a langevin - like friction within the framework of a fokker - planck ( fp ) description , although we shall see that the fp approach presents some difficulties in the confined geometry of the finite length pore , which we shall attempt to overcome by using an alternative description of the friction in terms of localized `` thermalizing centres '' .",
    "we also consider that there may be more specific binding interactions between the ion and the pore surface , for example with polar residues lining the surface .",
    "these are modelled by `` stopping traps '' - on encountering such a trap , an ions is stopped , and later released to continue its motion under the influence of friction and the electric field . the action of the stopping traps on the ion may or may not depend upon its velocity . in all cases , we attempt to find general analytic solutions for the stationary state ionic current @xmath2 , and sometimes also for the ion distribution function @xmath3 ( defined so that the probability of finding an ion between position @xmath4 and @xmath5 with velocity between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is @xmath8 ) .",
    "these solutions are functions of the applied field , as well as of parameters such as the channel length , friction coefficient and probability density of stopping traps .",
    "we hope that these results may ultimately be used to analyse the transport behaviour of specific pores or channels , by adapting the above physical parameters to the known structure of the pore under consideration .",
    "the general kinetic equation for the model is presented in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "the kinetic equation is solved in section [ sec3 ] for the case of a finite length channel with stopping traps but without friction , and in section [ sec4 ] in the case of a finite channel with friction but without traps ; difficulties arising from the use of the fp operator in a pore of finite length are discussed .",
    "these difficulties do not arise in the case of an infinite ( @xmath9 ) channel , for which a general solution is obtained in the presence of both friction and traps , in section [ sec5 ] . returning to a finite @xmath0 channel in section [ sec6 ] ,",
    "the fp friction is replaced by a distribution of thermalizing centres throughout the pore , and an explicit expression for the current is obtained in the presence of such thermalizing centres and stopping traps .",
    "concluding remarks are made in the last section .",
    "our model channel is pictured in figure [ fig1 ] . the channel , of length @xmath0 ,",
    "is located along the @xmath4-axis @xmath10 .",
    "the radius of the pore ( which is assumed to be cylindrical ) matches the ion radius , so that ionic motion inside the pore is strictly one - dimensional .",
    "the pore links two reservoirs containing ionic solutions of linear concentrations @xmath11 ( to the left ) and @xmath12 ( to the right ) : @xmath11 and @xmath12 are related to the bulk concentrations @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the reservoirs by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the radius of the pore .",
    "the inner surface of the pore is lined with stopping traps of local average density @xmath17 : we shall assume that the probability of finding @xmath18 traps within the interval @xmath19 is given by the poisson distribution with parameter @xmath20 .",
    "if an ion encounters a trap , its velocity is set to zero , generally irrespective of its initial velocity ( although we shall also consider in section [ sec3 ] the case of traps which discriminate between ions according to velocity ) .",
    "inside the pore , the ion ( of charge @xmath21 and mass @xmath22 ) is subjected to a uniform electric field @xmath23 , and hence undergoes an acceleration , towards the right , @xmath24 . after being stopped by a trap ,",
    "the ion is therefore re - accelerated by the electric field .",
    "ions also experience friction : this will initially be modelled by a force @xmath25 , where @xmath6 is the velocity of the ion , as well as the thermalizing effect of a random force , although an alternative to this langevin - like model will be presented in section [ sec6 ] . in summary ,",
    "the ion undergoes a constant acceleration due to the electric field , is slowed down by collisions with molecules inside the pore or on the pore surface ( these processes being described by a friction process ) and may be captured by traps along the channel , to account for temporary binding to polar residues on the pore surface .",
    "we shall present results for stationary state ion flow only .",
    "the general kinetic equation for the stationary state ion distribution function @xmath3 , in the presence of poisson - distributed stopping traps of average density @xmath17 as well as a langevin - like friction mechanism , with friction coefficient @xmath26 , is : @xmath27 the left - hand side ( l.h.s . ) of ( [ eq1 ] ) describes free flow of ions under the action of the constant acceleration @xmath28 arising from the external field .",
    "the r.h.s . contains two collision terms .",
    "the first accounts for the stopping traps : it is a balance between gain ( in the population of zero velocity particles ) and loss ( of particles with velocity @xmath6 ) .",
    "the second term is the fokker - planck operator acting on the distribution function : it accounts for the effect of the frictional and random forces .",
    "note that the kinetic equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is for a single ion : it does not account for interactions between several ions within the pore .",
    "this limitation will be addressed in later work .",
    "the reservoirs on the left ( @xmath29 ) and on the right ( @xmath30 ) of the channel are assumed to contain ions in thermodynamic equilibrium at the same temperature @xmath31 , but generally at different densities : @xmath11 ( to the left ) and @xmath12 ( to the right ) .",
    "the ion distribution functions in the reservoirs ( not including the contribution of any ions coming out of the pore ) are hence : @xmath32 where @xmath33}\\ ] ] is the maxwell velocity distribution function .    for illustrative purposes , we first consider the case where acceleration , traps and friction are all absent , and an ion which enters the pore at one end keeps the same velocity until it reaches the other end . the ion distribution function within the pore is then simply : @xmath34\\phi^t(v)\\ ] ] where @xmath35 denotes the heaviside step function .",
    "the ion current is given by : @xmath36 for a stationary state , continuity requires that the current be independent of position : @xmath37 substituting ( [ eq4 ] ) into ( [ eq5 ] ) one finds the result in the absence of acceleration , traps or friction : @xmath38 while the number density inside the channel @xmath39 is in this case given by @xmath40 .",
    "note that discontinuities arise in @xmath41 at the pore boundaries , @xmath42 : this reflects the fact that the regions close to the pore mouth are not modelled in detail in this simple theory .    in the subsequent sections , analytic solutions of the kinetic equation ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "will be derived for the limiting cases @xmath43 ( section [ sec3 ] ) , @xmath44 ( section [ sec4 ] ) and @xmath45 ( section [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "consider a pore of finite length @xmath0 , containing stopping traps but no friction mechanism .",
    "the traps have average local density @xmath17 and are distributed according to a poisson law as described in section [ sec2 ] : on encountering such a trap , the velocity of an ion is reduced to zero . in the absence of friction , the kinetic equation ( [ eq1 ] ) for the stationary state ion distribution function @xmath3 simplifies to : @xmath46 note that we obtain equation ( [ eq6 ] ) ( constant current throughout the pore ) on integrating both sides of ( [ eq9 ] ) over all velocities @xmath47 . if the traps are on average uniformly distributed ( @xmath48 ) , equation ( [ eq9 ] ) can be solved exactly for @xmath3 as shown in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "however , an expression for the ionic current @xmath2 can be obtained for any @xmath17 using simple arguments , without the need for an explicit solution for @xmath3 .",
    "we first note that in the stationary state , the contribution to the current due to an ion which enters the channel at one end depends only on its incoming velocity and its probability of eventually arriving at the other end , since @xmath2 does not depend on @xmath4 ( and there are no interactions between ions ) . for this model",
    ", all ions entering the channel from the left reservoir at @xmath49 will eventually reach @xmath50 , since on being stopped by a trap they are re - accelerated by the field towards the right ( assuming @xmath28 is positive ) .",
    "thus the contribution of these ions to the current is : @xmath51 ions entering the channel from the right at @xmath50 will reach @xmath49 only if they are not stopped either by the opposing field or by an encouter with a trap .",

    "equation ( [ eq15 ] ) shows that in this model , in the absence of friction , the current does not depend on the spatial distribution of the stopping traps , but only on the integral of @xmath17 between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "note that equations ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) were derived for @xmath63 .",
    "when @xmath64 , the roles of the right and left reservoirs must be interchanged .",
    "if the reservoir densities @xmath11 and @xmath12 are measured relative to an arbitrary `` reference density '' @xmath65 , such that @xmath66 and @xmath67 , a dimensionless form of the current is given by @xmath68 .",
    "this is plotted in figure [ fig2 ] , for the cases where the reservoir densities are equal ( @xmath69 ) or different ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows that the current saturates for large @xmath71 . for positive @xmath28 ,",
    "the current at saturation is due exclusively to ions from the left reservoir and @xmath72 ; for negative @xmath28 , @xmath73 . for values of @xmath71 below saturation , the magnitude of the current increases as the density of traps increases .",
    "this is because traps reduce the negative current contribution @xmath74 from the right reservoir ( for @xmath63 ) , without affecting the current @xmath75 of ions moving from the left , as can be seen in the insets , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( in dimensionless form ) are plotted individually for the case where @xmath76 .",
    "the discontinuity in the current at @xmath77 , observed for finite concentrations of traps ( @xmath78 ) , reflects the fact that the model is no longer valid in the absence of a field , when there is no stationary solution ( since ions that are stopped by a trap are not then re - accelerated ) . in the case of unequal ion densities in the two reservoirs ,",
    "the current - voltage curves are asymmetric , as shown in figure [ fig2]b .",
    "the saturation value of @xmath79 is now larger for negative @xmath28 , and @xmath2 is negative for small positive values of @xmath28 .    thus far , we have assumed that any ion which encounters a trap is stopped , regardless of its velocity .",
    "however , ions with low kinetic energy could be expected to be more likely to be bound by a polar residue lining a nanopore , than those with more energy .",
    "we now consider a variation on our previous model , in which a single trap is present at position @xmath80 inside the pore ( @xmath81 ) , which presents an `` energy barrier '' of height @xmath82 to all ions crossing @xmath80 .",
    "we shall consider two possible modes of action of this trap .    in model",
    "a , the trap at @xmath80 stops all ions with kinetic energy below the barrier height : @xmath83 ( and subsequently releases them to be re - accelerated by the electric field ) , but has no effect on ions with energy @xmath84 .",
    "the appropriate kinetic equation reads : @xmath85 equation ( [ eq16 ] ) can be solved analytically , but we shall instead use simple arguments , as before , to obtain the current @xmath2 without the explicit form of @xmath3 . as above , any ion entering the channel at the left extremity ( @xmath49 ) with velocity @xmath86 will eventually reach the right extremity ( @xmath50 ) , regardless of whether it is stopped by the trap .",
    "the contribution @xmath75 of these ions to the current is therefore given by ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "however , ions entering the channel at @xmath50 with velocity @xmath87 will only reach @xmath49 ( and hence contribute to the current ) if they are not stopped either by the field or by the energetic trap at @xmath88 .",
    "there are two possibilities , depending on the barrier height @xmath89 :    \\(1 ) @xmath90 . in this case ,",
    "any ion which reaches the trap with energy greater than @xmath89 , and so is not stopped , must have sufficient energy to overcome the remaining part of the opposing field between @xmath88 and @xmath58 . in order to have energy @xmath91 on reaching the trap at @xmath88",

    "this can be easily understood , since ions which come from the right - hand reservoir and are impeded by the barrier make a negative contribution to the current .",
    "an interesting general observation can be made here , that the presence of an energetic barrier can have the effect of increasing the ionic current . in figure",
    "[ fig3]b , the barrier height is fixed ( @xmath109 ) and the trap is moved towards the right - hand end of the pore .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics are seen to be rather sensitive to the position of the trap in the regime @xmath108 , although there is no dependence for larger @xmath106 .",
    "as @xmath88 increases , @xmath2 decreases , although the value as @xmath110 remains unchanged .",
    "we also consider an alternative energetic barrier model , model b. here , ions encountering the trap with energy greater than the barrier height , @xmath84 , do not continue unperturbed , as in model a , but instead lose energy @xmath89 , being released by the trap with reduced velocity @xmath111 , where @xmath112 .",
    "less energetic ions with @xmath113 are stopped by the trap , as in model a. following a line of reasoning as for model a , one finds that the total current ( when @xmath114 ) is : @xmath115\\ ] ] note that for model b , the current @xmath2 does not depend on the position @xmath88 of the trap . comparing expression ( [ eq24 ] ) with ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] )",
    ", we see that the current in model b with energy barrier @xmath89 is identical to that through the channel with stopping traps investigated at the beginning of this section , if @xmath116 .",
    "we now turn to a model where no stopping traps are present ( @xmath44 ) , but ions undergo frictional collisions inside the pore ( of finite length @xmath0 ) . the thermalizing effect on the ion of these collisions with the channel surface and with other molecules ( e.g. water )",
    "is modelled by a langevin mechanism , represented by a fokker - planck operator , so that the stationary state kinetic equation ( [ eq1 ] ) now becomes : @xmath117 equation ( [ eq25 ] ) may be solved subject to boundary conditions specifying the incoming particle fluxes from the left ( @xmath49 ) and from the right ( @xmath50 ) , _ i.e. _ :    [ eq26 ] @xmath118 @xmath119    in the limit of an infinitely long channel ( @xmath45 ) , the distribution must be homogeneous ( @xmath120 ) ; the solution of the corresponding fokker - planck equation ( _ i.e. _ ( [ eq25 ] ) without the @xmath121 operator in the free flow term ) is : @xmath122 on the other hand , a particular inhomogeneous solution of equation ( [ eq25 ] ) in a finite channel is : @xmath123 we now look for a solution of the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq25 ] ) for finite @xmath0 , satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ eq26 ] ) , in the form of a linear combination of the two solutions ( [ eq28 ] ) and ( [ eq29 ] ) : @xmath124\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] distribution ( [ eq30 ] ) indeed satisfies ( [ eq25 ] ) for all values of the coefficients @xmath125 and @xmath126 . imposing the boundary conditions ( [ eq26 ] )",

    "as the barrier height @xmath249 is increased , the current increases , showing that inserting an impedance to ion passage can actually enhance the total ion flow through the channel .",
    "this apparently somewhat counter - intuitive result can in fact be easily understood .",

    "@xmath180 increases the chances of an ion eventually arriving at @xmath186 , and thus enhances the current .",
    "this phenonenon may be of interest for biological ion channels , where the selectivity filter might play the role of an energetic barrier .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced some simple kinetic models for the transport of independent ions through narrow pores , under the influence of a constant acceleration , due to an applied external electric field .",
    "we consider only one - dimensional motion along the pore axis .",
    "analytic results have been obtained for the stationary ion current @xmath2 and , in some cases , also for the stationary non - equilibrium distribution function @xmath3 .",
    "boundary conditions at the ends of the pore are consistent with the presence of reservoirs containing ions at equilibrium , which determine the flux of ions entering the pore .",
    "the models include traps or energy barriers , which represent the temporary binding of an ion to polar residues lining the pore surface , and they also account for the friction and thermalization due to collisions of the ions with molecules ( _ e.g. _ water ) inside the pore as well as with its inner , confining surface . initially , this friction and thermalization was included using a fokker - planck operator in the kinetic equation .",
    "we were unable to find a solution for a pore of finite length @xmath0 when both traps and the fokker - planck description of friction are present .",
    "however , we have derived an explicit solution for the homogeneous case of an infinitely long pore . for pores of finite length",
    ", solutions are given for models with stopping traps or energy barriers in the absence of friction .",
    "for stopping traps , the current does not depend on the spatial distribution of the traps , but for a single energy barrier , there may be a dependence on its position , depending on its mechanism of action .",
    "we have also solved the kinetic equation for the distribution function @xmath3 , for a finite channel in the case where the fokker - planck mechanism is present but there are no traps or energy barriers . in this case , on imposing the incoming fluxes from the reservoirs at both ends of the pore , @xmath3 turns out not to be positive definite for short channels and/or small values of the friction constant @xmath26 .",
    "this unphysical behaviour can be understood in terms of competing time scales for high velocity ions ( which pass through the channel before they can be thermalized ) : the resulting ion current remains well - behaved , as does the number density profile . in view of this deficiency of the fokker - planck mechanism in a pore of finite length",
    ", we have introduced an alternative model , whereby ions are instead thermalized by encounters with a series of `` thermalizing centres '' , located at given positions inside the pore .",
    "energy barriers may also be present .",
    "an important conclusion arising from all the models which were considered is that the current @xmath2 invariably saturates as a function of the external field ( or equivalently the constant acceleration @xmath28 ) , since it is limited by the incoming flux from the reservoirs .",
    "this saturation behaviour contrasts with the linear increase of j with voltage predicted by the classic ghk result , which can be derived by solving the one - dimensional diffusion equation in the presence of a constant external field .",
    "a further interesting observation that emerges from this work is that the presence of stopping traps or energy barriers inside the pore can increase rather than decrease the ionic current .",
    "this is because the steady state flow of ions crossing the pore in the direction of the applied acceleration is unaffected by the traps or barriers , while the flow of ions against the field is reduced .",
    "when the former contribution is the dominant one , the current will be enhanced by the traps or barriers .    a question that arises",
    "is whether there is any correspondance between the two models of friction and thermalization considered in this work : the fokker - planck mechansim and the the model involving n thermalizing centres . in the absence of an applied field and of energy barriers , when ionic motion is driven only by the concentration gradient across the pore",
    ", an equivalence can be established between the two models ( c.f . equation ( [ 6.18 ] ) ) . however",
    ", under more general conditions , we have found no one - to - one correspondance between the two descriptions of dissipation .",
    "future work will include a complete numerical analysis of the model involving both energy barriers and thermalizing centres .",
    "we also plan to extend the kinetic models to include the possibility of collective ion permeation through a pore , by including ion - ion interactions .",

    "appropriate selection of parameters such as the pore length @xmath0 , the friction coefficient @xmath26 or the number and positions of the thermalizing centres and the positions and heights of the energy barriers , to correspond to the structure of real ion channels , should allow the predictions of these kinetic models to be compared to measured current - voltage characteristics .",
