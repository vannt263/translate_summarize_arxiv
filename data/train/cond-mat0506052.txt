    "_ to describe the phonon spectra in zncr@xmath8o@xmath10.@xcite based on a model calculation , where superexchange interaction between the magnetic ions infers a spin - phonon coupling , relative frequency shifts up to 10@xmath51 have been predicted .",
    "the order of magnitude of this effect corresponds nicely to the experimentally observed values in fecr@xmath8s@xmath10 and , therefore , wakamura@xcite considered this mechanism to dominate the phonons behavior for @xmath52 .",
    "subsequently , wakamura and coworkers@xcite discussed the sign of the relative frequency shift in terms of nearest - neighbor fm exchange and next - nearest - neighbor afm exchange for cdcr@xmath8s@xmath10 , which exhibits phonon modes with a similar temperature dependence as fecr@xmath8s@xmath10 .",
    "moreover , they could show that these anomalous changes in the phonon frequencies are absent in non - magnetic cdin@xmath8s@xmath10 , further corroborating their approach.@xcite thus , the positive shift of modes @xmath41 and @xmath42 would indicate that fm exchange ( cr - s - cr ) dominates in accordance with a strong influence of the ( cr - s ) force constants on these modes , and , correspondingly , the negative shift of modes @xmath43 and @xmath38 favors afm exchange ( cr - s - cd - s - cr ) with a strong influence of the ( cd - s ) force constants . note that a more rigorous theoretical treatment of anharmonic spin - phonon and phonon - phonon interactions in cubic spinels by wesselinova and apostolov@xcite confirms the above interpretation . in the interpretation of the effect of magnetic ordering on the ir active phonon modes becomes even more complicated , because there exist , besides fm nearest - neighbor cr - s - cr bonds , additional exchange paths via afm fe - s - fe and fe - s - cr - s - fe bonds .",
    "nevertheless , the overall temperature behavior of the phonon frequencies in fecr@xmath8s@xmath10 is similar to cdcr@xmath8s@xmath10 and may be well interpreted , accordingly .",
    "note , however , that a critical discussion of the above approach is given by bruesch and dambrogio.@xcite    a straightforward interpretation of the temperature dependence of the damping constants ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) is not obvious at all .",
    "again , considering only the anharmonicity of ionic non - magnetic crystals , the damping is expected to show some residual low - temperature value and a quasi - linear increase in the high - temperature limit , just as observed for the longitudinal damping constants of modes @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath53.@xcite however , the temperature dependence of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in general deviates from such a behavior : in the case of mode @xmath38 both damping constants show a broad maximum just above @xmath12 and a steep decrease towards lower temperature for @xmath54 .",
    "mode @xmath43 follows a similar temperature dependence for @xmath54 , but the reduction of the damping constants is slightly smaller , and in the paramagnetic regime @xmath34 and @xmath35 remain almost constant in contrast to the results of wakamura.@xcite the behavior of modes @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath52 appears even more complex , but one can identify the onset of enhancement damping close to @xmath11  k followed by broad cusp - like maxima close to 100  k , except for @xmath33 of mode  @xmath41 that increases linearly with decreasing temperatures .",
    "wakamura@xcite argues that the maxima of mode @xmath38 ( and @xmath43 ) are due to spin fluctuations of the fe spins , in agreement with the strong influence of the corresponding force constant on this mode according to bruesch and dambrogio .",
    "@xcite furthermore , long range spin order assumingly leads to the anomalous changes of the damping constants for all modes below @xmath12 . in comparison to the temperature dependences of the damping constants in",
    ", one finds that modes @xmath43 and @xmath38 behave similar to the case of .@xcite on the other hand , modes @xmath41 and @xmath42 in clearly reveal a more complex behavior than in , indicating a significant influence of the iron sublattice and the additional effective exchange coupling between fe - fe and fe - cr ions on these modes .",
    "additionally , we want to mention the large increase in intensity ( about 20  % ) for mode @xmath38 ( close to 120  @xmath27 ) when cooling from room temperature to 5  k ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the intensity remains almost constant above 200  k , while a linear increase with decreasing temperature is observed below 200  k. at this temperature , maxima appear in the temperature dependence of the damping constants , suggesting a correlation of the two phenomena with regard to the spin - fluctuation scenario discussed above .",
    "when adopting the overall interpretation of the data in terms of spin - phonon coupling , one has to consider , however , that e.g.  the appearance of the cusps in the damping constants may be connected to domain reorientation processes visible in the ac susceptibility@xcite and anomalies detected by ultrasonic investigations.@xcite although the absence of significant changes of the phonon frequencies contradicts the scenario of a structural phase transition at 60  k driven by orbital ordering as suggested in ref .  , it becomes clear that the complex mechanisms dominating the damping effects demand further theoretical studies to single out the important contributions in detail .     vs.  wave number for with @xmath19 ( upper panel ) and @xmath24 ( lower panel ) at @xmath36",

    "pure fecr@xmath8s@xmath10 shows clear anomalies in the eigenfrequencies at the transition from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic state , which can be explained by spin - phonon coupling . concerning the complex behavior of the damping constants , spin fluctuations in the vicinity of @xmath12",
    "may describe many of the anomalous changes , but further theoretical studies are necessary to corroborate this interpretation .",
    "the influence of magnetic order on the eigenmodes is reduced with increasing @xmath18 , and the appearance of a new phonon mode close to 350  @xmath27 is attributed to an impurity mode rather than to a symmetry reduction due to a - site order .",

    "the conductivity of the free charge carriers can be described by a normal drude - type behavior .",
    "the dc conductivity for @xmath19 is enhanced by a factor of four in comparison to @xmath24 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the optically derived dc conductivity for both doped compounds is is in good agreement with resistivity measurements , but localization effects at lowest temperatures appear weaker in the optical measurements .",
    "the corresponding behavior of the scattering rate , which shows a strong decrease below the ferrimagnetic phase transition , evidences the freezing - out of disorder scattering below @xmath12 . in accordance with the proposed classification of the ternary chalcogenide spinels as spin - disorder magnetoresistive materials ,",
    "the reduction of the relaxation rate corroborates such a scenario and makes clear that spin - disorder has to be considered a necessary ingredient towards a theoretical description of this fascinating class of materials .",

    "<S> a detailed investigation of phonon excitations and charge carrier dynamics in single crystals of fe@xmath0cu@xmath1cr@xmath2s@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) has been performed by using infrared spectroscopy . in fecr@xmath2s@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> the phonon eigenmodes are strongly affected by the onset of magnetic order . despite enhanced screening effects , a continuous evolution of the phonon excitations can be observed in the doped compounds with @xmath5 ( metallic ) and @xmath6 ( bad metals ) , but the effect of magnetic ordering on the phonons is strongly reduced compared to @xmath7 . the drude - like charge - carrier contribution to the optical conductivity in the doped samples indicates that the colossal magneto - resistance effect results from the suppression of spin - disorder scattering . </S>"
