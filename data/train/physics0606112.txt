    "an important aim of current wideband raman experiments is to try to efficiently generate few - cycle pulses @xcite . if driven strongly enough , the two - photon raman transition modulates the incoming field by adding sidebands separated by the transition frequency .",
    "wideband fields are generated as these sidebands generate sidebands of their own ( and so on ) , thus generating a wide comb of frequency components separated by the transition frequency . if a scheme can be implemented that adjusts the phases of each component appropriately , then few- or single- cycle optical pulses can be obtained ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "standard theoretical treatments of this process split the field into fields components centred on the teeth of this comb .",
    "the approach has the advantage that the components can be modeled reasonably well with slowly varying envelopes , but of course it has the disadvantage of needing to keep track of a large number of components .    in experiments like those of sali",
    "@xcite , the raman transition is driven near - resonantly by a pair of intense pump pulses about 100fs long ; compared to the transition frequency of about 130thz , the spectra of each pump pulse ( and hence the generated sidebands ) are relatively narrow .",
    "this means that a multi - component model is still not unreasonable , even if numerical considerations might demand that the arrays used to store these spectra overlap in frequency space .",
    "however , if we were to move to shorter pump pulses , or to a single ( much shorter ) pump pulse with enough bandwidth to efficiently excite the transition , we would reach the regime where the `` teeth '' from the spectral comb significantly overlap . at this point , not only",
    "would we be forced to move from an svea ( slowly varying envelope approximation ) solution of the field propagation to a more accurate generalized few - cycle envelope approximation ( gfea ) @xcite , but the utility of multiple field components becomes questionable . in this regime it can be advantageous to treat the field as a single unit , rather than splitting it into pieces . note that this approach still differs from solutions of maxwell s equations such as fdtd ( finite difference time domain)@xcite or pssd ( pseudospectral spatial domain)@xcite , because our single - field is based on a second - order wave equation , and uses a convenient choice of carrier function to define a field envelope .    following these considerations",
    ", we now derive a _",
    "single - field _ model for raman generation , and , apart from that notable detail , follow an analogous path to that of hickman , paisner , and bischel ( hpb ) @xcite . in the model , we find that the coupling constants retain an oscillatory behaviour at the transition frequency , and that it is this that impresses the sideband modulation on the propagating field .",
    "since the field is not only wideband , but contains significant sideband components , we need to propagate this ( no longer slowly varying ) field envelope using the gfea .",
    "the necessity of allowing for these can be demonstrated by converting the single - field model into a multi - field counterpart  without the envelope - gradient corrections , we will not get a correct multi - field model .",
    "we model the wideband raman generation process in the following way .",
    "we specify the field frequencies ( @xmath0 ) of interest , which are usually at integer spacings of the transition frequency ( @xmath1 ) from the main pump laser frequency ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "each of these field components is described usin a standard envelope theory ( i.e. as @xmath3 ) with a time - history , allowing us to simulate pulses as they travel through the raman medium .",
    "the raman medium is modelled as a two - level atom using a ( its ) bloch vector @xmath4 , and this bloch vector is driven by each combination of spectrally adjacent field components ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "each of the field components @xmath6 is driven by the atomic polarization ( @xmath7 ) in combination with its pair of adjacent field components ( i.e. @xmath8 ) .",
    "the transition evolves as ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11    @xmath12\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath13 is the number density of the atoms or molecules ; @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the population and polarization decay rates for the transition ; @xmath16 is the field - transition coupling constant ; @xmath17 is the stark shift coefficient ; @xmath18 are the frequencies and wavevectors for the field components , @xmath19 gives a rotating frame for @xmath20    additionally , a cauchy dispersion is applied to the propagation of the field components .",
    "because each of the field components has a time - history , this translates to a spectral width . in typical cases with roughly nanosecond pulse lengths , the bandwidth of each component will be tiny compared to the transition frequency , so there will be large uneventful gaps in the total spectrum .",
    "in contrast , if the pulse lengths drop to ( say ) roughly 100 femtoseconds , the bandwidths of the field components will form a noticeable fraction of the total spectrum      as regards the mismatch terms in the raman model , geoff new has remarked ( email , 20040121 ) that there s a key point about the @xmath21 s that is not made properly in most of the mcdonald et al publications ; since it is usually said rather enigmatically that the @xmath22 s are `` parameterized '' by @xmath14 .",
    "the point is that if one assumes a cauchy - type law for the refractive index variation , all the gamma s are linked by a recurrence relation , and so you only need to specify one of them , from which all the others will follow .",
    "the point is made properly ( to gn s knowledge ) only in ref @xcite .",
    "_ note : this single field derivation does mean some of the approximations as to the `` slowness '' of the field variation seem somewhat stringent .",
    "however , since a conversion to a multi - field model is possible , it would seem the field variation constraints are less stringent than they would first appear . _",
    "i start by considering the wave function @xmath23 of a single molecule ( e.g. h@xmath24 ) and the electric field @xmath25 , and write the time - dependent wave function by expanding it in terms of the eigenfunctions in the field - free ( i.e. @xmath26 ) case .",
    "this means i can get the expansion coefficients by solving for an effective schredinger equation that contains a two - photon rabi frequency created by means of an interaction term based on a field - dependent dipole moment .",
    "i assume a dispersionless medium and write all equations in terms of position @xmath27 and retarded times @xmath28 . here",
    "i follow the method of hpb @xcite , but use only a single @xmath25 field rather than multiple components .",
    "note that hpb use _ gaussian _ units , so there can appear to be inconsistencies when comparing my formulae ( in s.i . ) to theirs .",
    "i denote the known molecular eigenfunctions of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath29 as @xmath30 , and their corresponding energies @xmath31 .",
    "i want to obtain the solution to   @xmath32   where @xmath33 is the electronic dipole moment operator and the @xmath34 are a set of complex probability amplitudes .    a standard derivation for the equations of motion of the @xmath35 co - efficients proceeds as ",
    "@xmath36    we now use perturbation theory , & @xmath37 , following two independent ( but related ) strands .      this strand leaves the perturbing potential as a function of electric field @xmath25 , and does not replace it with a carrier - envelope description .",

    "the diagonal couplings @xmath48 are real ; but the off - diagonal couplings @xmath49 undergo complex oscillations according to the difference in their energy levels .",
    "their _ frequency dependence _ is discussed after the following subsection ; hpb s corresponding parameters , which _ do not oscillate _ , were assumed to be frequency independent .",
    "this strand replaces the electric field @xmath25 with a carrier - envelope description , but , unlike hpb , i use only a single carrier - envelope component rather than a set indexed by some integer @xmath50 .",
    "this is necessary , because in the previous strand i ended up with coupling constants @xmath51 with strong frequency dependences .",
    "these redefined @xmath58 parameters still oscillate , as they must because unlike in the hpb derivation , there is no frequency difference between field components to cancel with the raman transition frequency .",
    "the coupling also varies with frequency , which is discussed next .",
    "i now discuss two particular ( and vital ) approximations applied to the raman coupling parameters .",
    "first , note that ( as in hpb ) , i will take the indices @xmath46 and @xmath47 to correspond to the two states involved in the ( raman ) transition of interest ; these will be the @xmath59 and @xmath46 vibrational ( or perhaps rotational ) levels of the electronic ground state .",
    "indices @xmath60 and above will correspond to ( quoting hpb ) `` translational motion on higher electronic states '' .",
    "_ note : i can see that assigning these indices to higher electronic states will conveniently keep the energy separations for transitions to greater than that of the @xmath61 transitions , but it s not so clear to me why i can ignore all the higher vibrational ( or rotational ) states . _    since i am interested only in the raman transition , i specialise the above equations for the coefficients @xmath34 , calculating @xmath62 and @xmath63 only , and assuming that the @xmath64 dipole moment is zero .",
    "this means we will only be including transitions between indices @xmath46 and @xmath47 that _ go via one of the higher states _",
    "@xmath65 , since we still allow @xmath66 .",
    "further , i solve for the coefficients for the higher states in terms of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , in an adiabatic approximation justified when @xmath62 and @xmath63 vary only slowly compared to the exponential terms .",
    "_ note : separate from the oscillations that occur in my coupling parameters ( but not in hpb ) , there is the issue of _ frequency dependence _ which applies to both hpb and my parameters .",
    "_    for both hpb ( their eqn.(15 ) ) , and my field - carrier based derivation ( eqn.([eqn - single - a - alpha ] ) ) , the presence of the field carrier in the denominator is helpful .",
    "since it can reasonably be assumed to be much greater than the inter(raman)-level energy differences , the fractional terms will be correspondingly small , and so the @xmath51 ( @xmath58 ) parameters can be assumed to be independent of frequency ( or at least nearly so ) .",
    "this is not in any way obviously ( or even partially ) true for the no - carrier @xmath25 based ( eqn.([eqn - single - e - alpha ] ) , @xmath51 ) parameters , which depend only on the difference in raman levels  at best you might perhaps hope that the denominators were approximate multiples of each other .",
    "this approximation allows me to equate @xmath70 to @xmath71 , and hence change @xmath72 in the @xmath73 equation below .",
    "this is a vital step in getting to a simple form equivalent to the bloch equations .",
    "this follows from the above assumption ( as per hpb ) that the forward and backward transitions ( between levels 2 and 1 ) have nearly the same amplitude .",
    "this approximation allows me to replace @xmath70 with @xmath74 in the @xmath75 equation below , which simplifies my notation and makes the coupling term match that in the @xmath73 equation , important in getting to true bloch equations .",

    "i do not know whether smn silently assumes @xmath200 , or factors @xmath161 into @xmath201 . in any case",
    "@xmath200 is usually accurate enough in gases .",
    "however , one hidden complication with my above equation is that @xmath202 includes both the center `` pump '' field and the raman sideband we are amplifying  thus to properly check the gain co - efficient , we should expand it into its components , as is done below .",
    "thus the sideband envelope @xmath206 evolves as   @xmath207    since @xmath208 .",
    "i do nt convert @xmath206 into @xmath209 because it occurs equally on both side of the equation .",
    "the single - field raman model above can be converted into a traditional multi - field model as developed in e.g. hpb @xcite or syed , mcdonald and new @xcite by replacing the field envelope with a sum of multiple envelopes using carrier exponentials spaced at the raman frequency .",
    "when doing this , i will only get the correct multi - field form if few - cycle ( either sewa or gfea ) corrections to the field evolution part of the theory are applied to the effective polarization caused by the raman transition .",
    "the idea is to replace the single field envelope with a sum of multiple envelopes spaced at the raman frequency , which are best placed to represent the comb of frequencies generated by the raman interaction .",
    "note that it will not necessarily be identical to hpb and/or smn , because the field equations are derived from a propagation equation using a @xmath210 carrier , but it will be very closely related .",
    "starting from eqns.([eqn - rbpostrwa - wb - rho],[eqn - rbpostrwa - wb - w ] ) , since the single - field evolution equation ( eqn.([eqn - single - apropagate ] ) ) uses an envelope @xmath185 that is based on a carrier ( see eqn.([eqn - single - efroma ] ) ) , the single - field envelope @xmath185 is replaced with @xmath211 s at frequency @xmath212 with wavevector @xmath213 ; thus @xmath214 , @xmath215 ; also @xmath216 .",
    "the single - field envelope in terms of the new @xmath211 s is   @xmath217\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        where the factor @xmath222 turns into @xmath223 because the double summation gives two identical terms that only occur once in the single summation .",
    "when split into equations for @xmath224 and @xmath191 , the corresponding factor becomes @xmath225 .",
    "this equation for @xmath226 is equivalent to ( smn 2)@xcite , except i have just @xmath227 whereas they have @xmath228 ; however note they have the reverse sign in their carrier wave , so the only physical difference is the @xmath229 part ; also my definitions of the coupling differs slightly .",
    "note the rwa s above ( for both polarization and inversion equations ) discard modulations at frequency of multiples of @xmath230 .",
    "quite a lot of physics has been removed by these rwa approximations , although it is very reasonable except in the very wideband limit .",
    "for example , the effect of next - nearest neighbour field components acting on the transition have been ignored , as have all more distant field - field interactions . in the next - nearest neighbour case",
    ", the dropped terms would impose a rapid @xmath230 oscillation onto the polarization @xmath73 , which would in turn tend to impose sidebands at @xmath233 onto each field component .",
    "it is reasonable to ignore such sidebands in the narrowband limit studied by most users of a multi - field raman theory ; but , in principle one might extend a multi - field theory to include them by inventing a scheme to apply the sidebands to the field component they are ( near ) resonant with .",
    "note that the field evolution equation already has a carrier of @xmath234 $ ] factored out of it .",
    "thus i use @xmath235 from @xmath236 $ ] , not @xmath185 . finally , i need to insert the gfea few - cycle correction to the polarization term , because my ( @xmath237 ) sub - envelopes @xmath211 have an @xmath238 time dependence that can not be neglected .",
    "this is in agreement with both hpb@xcite barring the opposite sign on the rhs  similar agreement occurs with smn@xcite once i identify @xmath242 .",
    "note that generally @xmath130 , as it just controls a frame rotation for @xmath73 .",
    "note that we can assume , quite reasonably , that the multi - field envelopes @xmath211 will be better behaved than the single - field envelope @xmath185 .",
    "however , we have made _ more _ approximations , notably by rwaing away all the off - resonant cross terms driving the atomic transition so a multi - field approach is not always better .",
    "these off - resonant terms are at @xmath243  see just prior to the starting point above of eqns.([eqn - rbpostrwa - w0-rho ] , [ eqn - rbpostrwa - w0-w ] ) .",
    "see _ `` wideband pulse propagation : single - field and multi - field approaches to raman interactions '' _ by kinsler and new @xcite .",
    "i describe how to model a multi - frequency field such as that seen in a wideband raman generation experiment using a single field envelope rather than a set of envelopes , one at each stokes or anti - stokes frequency .",
    "this requires that the field be propagated taking into account wideband effects , as described by either the sewa theory of brabec and krausz @xcite , or the more general gfea of kinsler and new @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of this single - field approach is not restricted to the raman interaction described in this paper . it would be equally valuable for a near - degenerate optical parametric oscillator , or indeed any system where any two or more field components contain spectra that start to overlap as the pump or probe pulses get shorter .",
    "it is important to note that it will usually only be more efficient to use a single - field simulation if pump pulses are very short , and effects like the next - nearest neighbour field interactions , neglected in the multi - field theory , need to be included , or if the extra computational overhead is not inconvenient .",
    "this is because in a single - field simulation , a very fine time - resolution is necessary to model the polarization and field oscillations closely enough to get good numerical convergence .",
    "however , this situation improves when the raman transition has a smaller frequency compared to the pump pulse frequencies .",
    "one useful side effect of the fine time resolution is that it naturally gives a wide spectral bandwidth , so that many stokes and anti - stokes lines are modeled quite naturally .",
    "further , our single - field model could be invaluable in modeling a short pulse pump - probe experiment where the probe frequency does not match any of the stokes or anti - stokes spectral lines generated by the pump pulse(s ) . a multi - field simulation would then need arrays for both the pump and probe raman ` ladders' of stokes / anti - stokes lines , and the role of next nearest neighbour interactions ( ignored in the multi - field model ) could well become more significant .    in summary ,",
    "the advantages of our single - field approach are twofold .",
    "first , it includes more physics than the multi - field approach , even compared to a multi - field approach enhanced by adding gfea corrections to the propagation of the field components .",
    "secondly , it deals effortlessly with the complications of overlapping spectra in the multi - field case .",
