    "* initial states of the observable universe .  * how our universe began ?",
    "this is one of the biggest question in cosmology .",
    "the observation of the cosmic microwave background tells us about the cosmological perturbation at the last scattering , which realistic scenarios of the early universe should explain . if inflation took place preceding the big - bang nucleosynthesis , the quantum fluctuation of the inflaton can generate the seed of the cosmological fluctuation which is consistent with the scale - invariant spectrum at large scales",
    "therefore , in the context of the inflationary scenario , which is currently the most successful scenario of the early universe , the period of inflation is the earliest part of our observable universe . in this series of papers ,",
    "we pursue the question ; `` what can we claim about the initial quantum state of the observable universe if we require that the theoretical prediction should be stable against the infrared ( ir ) loop contribution ? '' the adiabatic vacuum is widely accepted to be the most natural vacuum at least for a free field theory , since it mimics the vacuum of the flat spacetime in the ultraviolet ( uv ) limit .",
    "however , in a number of publications  @xcite , it has been suggested that the adiabatic vacuum may not be stable against the ir contributions in the presence of non - linear interactions .",
    "* non - locality of the action and ir divergence problem .",
    "* when we assume that the free field has the scale invariant spectrum in the ir limit , a naive consideration can easily lead to the ir divergence due to loop corrections . here",
    "we illustrate how the ir divergence can appear from the loop corrections of the curvature perturbation in single field models . choosing the time slicing on which the inflaton field is homogeneous",
    ", we can express the action in terms of the unique dynamical degrees of freedom @xmath1 , the curvature perturbation , and the lagrange multipliers @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the lapse function and the shift vector . the hamiltonian and the momentum constraint equations relate the dynamical variable @xmath1 to the multipliers @xmath2 and @xmath3 . as is explicitly shown in various papers , for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , these constraint equations are elliptic - type equations , and schematically written as @xmath4\\ , , \\qquad   \\partial^2 n_i = f_i[\\zeta]\\ , ,   \\label{eq : c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes the spatial laplacian . by requesting the regularity at the spatial infinity , the boundary conditions of these elliptic - type equations are uniquely fixed . substituting the expressions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 into the action ,",
    "we obtain @xmath6   = \\int { { \\rm d}}^4 x\\ , { \\cal l}[\\zeta,\\ , \\partial^{-2 } f[\\zeta],\\ ,   \\partial^{-2 } f_i[\\zeta ] ] \\ , , \\label{exp : sz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence the evolution of @xmath1 is described by the above _ non - local _ action . here the inverse laplacian @xmath7 is usually supposed to be defined as multiplying the inverse of the eigenvalue of the laplacian operator by using the harmonic decomposition .",
    "when we evaluate the loop corrections to the @xmath0-point functions expanding them in terms of the interaction picture field @xmath8 , we need to evaluate the expectation values such as @xmath9 inserting the scale invariant spectrum into @xmath10 leads to the logarithmic divergence as @xmath11 .",
    "the second expression of eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) , which may arise as a consequence of the operation of @xmath7 , is more singular as @xmath12 , which diverges quadratically .",
    "the presence of non - local interactions enhances the long range correlations , and hence the singular behaviour in the ir .",
    "when we introduce the ir cutoff , say at the hubble scale at a particular time @xmath13 , the variance @xmath10 shows the logarithmic secular growth as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , denote the scale factor and the hubble scale at @xmath17 . if the ir divergence exists , the loop corrections , which are suppressed by an extra power of the amplitude of the power spectrum @xmath18 , may dominate in case inflation continues sufficiently long , leading to the break down of perturbation .",
    "* the dilatation symmetry as a necessary ingredient for ir regularity . * the regularization of the ir contributions has been discussed in a number of publications  @xcite .",
    "the important aspect in discussing the long wavelength mode of @xmath1 is the dilatation symmetry of the system .",
    "as is expected from the fact that the spatial metric is given in the form @xmath19 , a constant shift of the dynamical variable @xmath1 can be absorbed by the overall rescaling of the spatial coordinates .",
    "hence , the action for @xmath1 preserves the dilatation symmetry : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant parameter .",
    "( there are a number of literatures where this dilatation symmetry is addressed .",
    "see for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and the references therein . )",
    "one may naively expect that we can absorb the ir divergent contribution of @xmath1 using this constant shift . as an example",
    ", we set the parameter @xmath21 to the spatial average of the curvature perturbation within the hubble patch at @xmath13 , @xmath22 , where the size of the hubble patch in comoving coordinates is given by @xmath23 .",
    "then , the logarithmically divergent two - point function @xmath10 seems to be replaced with @xmath24 , which is finite but still grows logarithmically in time .",
    "one may think that if the system is described in such a way that the symmetry under the time dependent dilatation transformation is manifest , setting @xmath25 to the time dependent spatial average in the hubble patch , the logarithmic growth of @xmath26 might be eliminated .",
    "however , the reduced action written in terms of @xmath1 ( [ exp : sz ] ) does not preserve the invariance under the dilatation transformation with the time dependent parameter @xmath25 .",
    "for example , in the recent literature  @xcite , the authors showed that when we consider the whole universe with the infinite spatial volume , the dilatation transformation should be time independent to preserve the action invariant .",
    "in addition , the two - point function with @xmath7 can not be regularized by considering the dilatation symmetry alone .",
    "this quick consideration tells us that the presence of the dilatation symmetry of the system may play an important role in the regularization of the ir contributions but is not sufficient to guarantee the ir regularity and the absence of the secular growth .",
    "* residual _ gauge _ degrees of freedom in the local universe . *",
    "a missing piece in the above discussion is to pay careful attention to what are the quantities we can actually observe . since our observable region is a limited portion of the whole universe , the observable fluctuations must be composed of local quantities . furthermore , as the information that we can access is limited to our observable region , there is no reason to request the regularity at the spatial infinity in solving the elliptic constraint equations ( [ eq : c ] ) .",
    "then , there arise degrees of freedom in choosing the boundary conditions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) .",
    "the degrees of freedom in solutions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be understood as the degrees of freedom in choosing coordinates . as we showed in refs .",
    "@xcite , these residual coordinate transformations are expressed in terms of homogeneous solutions to the laplace equation as @xmath27 where @xmath28 are symmetric traceless tensors , which satisfy @xmath29 . here , we abbreviated the non - linear terms in the coordinate transformation .",
    "note that this coordinate transformations include the dilatation transformation with the time dependent function @xmath25 . since the transformations in eq .",
    "( [ exp : rc ] ) are nothing but coordinate transformations , the diffeomorphic invariant action @xmath30 $ ] should preserve the symmetry under these transformations .",
    "thus , when we consider only the local observable region , which is a potion of the whole universe , we find an infinite number of coordinate transformations which keep the action invariant .",
    "considering the dilatation transformation in the whole universe is subtle in the sense that the transformation diverges at the spatial infinity , even if the parameter @xmath21 is very small .",
    "by contrast , restricted to the local region , the magnitude of the coordinate transformations in eq .",
    "( [ exp : rc ] ) is kept perturbatively small . in this paper",
    ", we refer to the local observable ( spacetime ) region as @xmath31 .",
    "the size of the observable region on each time slicing is supposed to be of order @xmath32 at least in the far past since the past light cone asymptotes to that size .",
    "we should note that , once we insert the expressions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 into the action to obtain the action for the curvature perturbation @xmath1 , the symmetry under the residual coordinates transformation is lost , because specific boundary conditions are chosen for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in fixing coordinates . to emphasize the distinction between the coordinate transformations associated with the change of the boundary conditions and the usual gauge transformation , which keeps the action invariant",
    ", we denote the former by the _ gauge _",
    "transformation in the italic font .    * removing the residual _ gauge _ degrees of freedom .",
    "* one way to realize the invariance under the gauge transformation is fixing the gauge conditions completely .",
    "the residual _ gauge _ degrees of freedom introduced above can be also removed by employing additional _ gauge _ conditions , _",
    "i.e. , _ by fixing the boundary conditions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the boundary of the local region @xmath31 .",
    "then , we naturally expect that the ir regularity may be explicitly shown by performing the quantization in this local region , since the wavelengths that fit within this local region @xmath31 will be bounded by the size of the region .",
    "although the quantization in the local region is an interesting approach , it is not so clear how to perform the quantization after removing the residual _ gauge _ degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the difficulties is that even the translation symmetry of the quantum state can not be easily guaranteed in the local system , since it is manifestly broken by introducing the boundary condition at a finite distance .",
    "( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    as an alternative way , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we first set the initial state considering the whole universe , and then we performed the residual _ gauge _ transformation ( [ exp : rc ] ) to fix the coordinates so that the ir contributions are absorbed . through the transformation with @xmath33 ,",
    "the curvature perturbation is transmitted as @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the original curvature perturbation defined in the whole universe and its spatial average over the whole universe is set to 0 as in the conventional cosmological perturbation theory . by contrast",
    ", @xmath36 is the curvature perturbation relevant to the local universe , and its spatial average over the local region @xmath37 is set to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a time constant surface . in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered the fluctuation of the inflaton , using the flat gauge , but the same discussion follows also for the curvature perturbation @xmath1 . in the recent publication by senatore and zaldarriaga  @xcite , the same degrees of freedom in choosing coordinates are used in a slightly different way to absorb the ir divergent contributions . if the non - linear terms in the residual _ gauge _ transformation at the initial time  ( [ exp : rc2 ] ) did not yield ir divergent contributions , the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite would have proved the absence of ir divergence in general .",
    "what was shown there is that once the field operator after the residual _ gauge _ transformation is guaranteed to be regular at the initial time , its succeeding evolution does not produce ir divergence .",
    "the heart of the proof is that @xmath40 is replaced with @xmath41 in the expansion of the composite operators in terms of the interaction picture field , after the residual _ gauge _ transformation , and hence the ir contributions from @xmath40 are always canceled by those from @xmath42 .",
    "however , the non - linear part of the transformation at the initial time contains @xmath26 whose ir contributions logarithmically diverge .",
    "the lesson is that it is not straightforward to reformulate the way of quantization so that the ir divergent contributions therein are all absorbed by the residual _ gauge _ transformation .",
    "( the absorption of the ir modes of the curvature perturbation was intended in other frameworks such as @xmath43 formalism  @xcite and the semi - classical approach  @xcite . )    * the secular growth . * the appearance of ir divergence due to the residual _ gauge _ transformation mentioned above might be evaded by sending the initial time to the past infinity .",
    "this is because the size of the local region @xmath37 in comoving coordinates becomes infinitely large in this limit , making the discrepancy between the average in the local region and that in the global universe smaller and smaller",
    ". then it might be effectively unnecessary to perform the residual _ gauge _ transformation at the initial time , although this statement is not very rigorous .",
    "we should note that when we send the initial time to the past infinity , it is too naive to neglect the non - ir modes which are comparable to or shorter than the hubble length scale , because all the modes were much shorter than the hubble length scale in the distant past .",
    "this makes the issue regarding the secular growth much more complicated .",
    "for instance , once we include the contributions from the non - ir modes , we can not use the conservation of @xmath44 in the limit @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the comoving wavenumber of the external leg , relying on the long wavelength approximation such as @xmath43 formalism . here ,",
    "in a simple example , we show that vertex integrations can yield the apparent secular growth through the non - linear contributions from the modes at around the hubble scale .",
    "even if the vertex is confined in the region @xmath31 , the integration region of each vertex is still infinite in the time direction as @xmath47 , which may cause the secular growth . roughly speaking",
    ", the integrand @xmath48 will be written in terms of the dimensionless time dependent slow roll parameters and the wavenumber of the fields in this vertex @xmath49 normalized by the hubble scale .",
    "if we focus on the non - linear interaction composed of the modes with @xmath49 of order unity , the integrand @xmath48 are expressed only in terms of the parameters which are supposed to change very slowly in time and then the contribution from the interaction vertex seems to yield the logarithmic growth .",
    "this is another origin of the secular growth , which should be distinguished from the one inherited from the ir behavior of @xmath50 .",
    "of course the above argument is too native , but it shows that the absence of the secular growth from the vertex integration is rather subtle , requiring more careful treatment about the modes around the hubble scale .",
    "because of this subtlety , introducing the uv cutoff at the length scale longer or equal to the hubble length scale by hand makes the discussion incomplete .",
    "in fact , if it were allowed to simply neglect the short wavelength modes , the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite with the initial time @xmath51 sent to @xmath52 would have given a rough proof of the absence of ir divergence without any limitation to the quantum state by sending the initial time to the past infinity , which contradicts our current claim that the quantum state is restricted in order to avoid ir divergence .",
    "recently , the absence of the secular growth was claimed relying on the conservation of the curvature perturbation in refs .",
    "@xcite , but the aspects mentioned above were not discussed . in addition , even if the conservation of @xmath44 in the limit @xmath45 is proved , the logarithmic enhancement in the form @xmath53 may give rise , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the scale factor and the hubble parameter at the initial time . the factor @xmath56 can become large to overcome the suppression by @xmath57 when we send the initial time to the past infinity .",
    "* short summary of the results . * in this subsection , we summarize what we will show in this paper . taking account of the current status of ir issues mentioned above , we will establish the following three statements in this paper :    1 .",
    "there is an alternative equivalent hamiltonian that describes the quantum dynamics of our interest and whose interaction part is solely composed of the ir irrelevant operators ( , which mean the field operators associated with the operations that manifestly suppress the ir contribution such as @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "the euclidean vacuum state , which is specified by the regularity when the time coordinates in the @xmath0-point functions are analytically continued to the imaginary in the complex plane , is physically the same both in the alternative description mentioned in item 1 , and in the original description .",
    "3 .   the @xmath0-point functions in the euclidean vacuum state respect the spatial translation invariance and are regular in the ir .",
    "the secular growth is absent , even if we include the vertices with non - ir modes , as long as very high order of loop corrections are not concerned .    below",
    "we add a little more detailed explanations about the above three items .",
    "* _ gauge _ issue . * in this paper , the quantization and fixing the initial quantum state as a starting point of our discussion is performed in the original system which describes the whole universe , where the residual _ gauge _ degrees of freedom are left unfixed .",
    "then , following refs .",
    "@xcite , we introduce a field operator which preserves the invariance under any spatial coordinates transformations , including residual _ gauge _ transformations .",
    "we refer to such an operator as a genuine _ gauge _ invariant operator . as a representative",
    ", we consider a genuine _ gauge _ invariant curvature perturbation , @xmath60 .",
    "as long as the expectation values of such genuine gauge invariant operators are concerned , we can perform the residual _ gauge _ transformation without affecting the results of computations .",
    "we will show that , using this residual _ gauge _ transformation , the boundary conditions of the non - local operator @xmath7 in the action can be modified to be regular in the ir .",
    "* requirement of the _ gauge _ invariance in quantum state .",
    "* to calculate the @xmath0-point functions which preserve the invariance under the residual _ gauge _ transformations , the initial state should be also specified in a genuinely _ gauge _ invariant manner . however ,",
    "when we perform the quantization considering the whole universe , preserving the residual _ gauge _ invariance becomes obscure , because these residual _ gauge _ degrees of freedom are not present as long as we deal with the whole universe . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we discovered a correspondence between the ir regularity and the invariance under the residual _ gauge _ transformations , which will provide an important clue to the guiding principle in choosing the genuinely _ gauge _ invariant initial state .",
    "to discuss this point , aside from the original canonical variables @xmath35 and its conjugate momentum @xmath61 , whose evolution is governed by the action ( [ exp : sz ] ) , we introduced another set of the canonical variables corresponding to the description in the coordinates shifted by a constant dilatation transformation : @xmath62 where @xmath21 is a time independent c - number and @xmath63 is the conjugate momentum of @xmath64 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that requesting the equivalence between the two quantum systems described by @xmath65 and @xmath66 guarantees the ir regularity of loop corrections . here",
    ", the equivalence of two quantum systems means that the same iteration scheme ( or formally the same initial condition of the interacting system ) gives physically the same quantum state in both systems related to each other by the dilatation transformation .",
    "namely , all the expectation values evaluated in both systems are equivalent if we take into account how they transform under dilatation transformation . requesting this equivalence",
    "will be thought of as the invariance of the initial state under the dilatation transformation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we employed the iteration scheme in which the interaction is turned on at a finite past .",
    "then , it turned out that the ir regularity/_gauge _ invariance condition can not be consistently imposed . in the present paper",
    "we will set the initial quantum state at the infinite past .",
    "we will show that the above transformation can be extended to allow a time dependence of the parameter @xmath21 . as we described in the previous section",
    ", this extension plays a crucial role in discussing the absence of the secular growth .    * the euclidean vacuum . *",
    "the second and third items are related with each other , once we establish the correspondence between the _ gauge _ invariance and the ir regularity .",
    "we will show that the two quantum systems described by @xmath65 and @xmath66 are equivalent if we choose the euclidean vacuum , which is defined by requesting the regularity of the @xmath0-point functions at the distant past with the time path rotated toward the complex plane . to be more specific , as the second item",
    ", we will show that the @xmath0-point functions for @xmath35 calculated by the canonical variables @xmath65 with the boundary condition of the euclidean vacuum agrees with the @xmath0-point functions for @xmath67 calculated by the canonical variables @xmath66 under formally the same boundary condition , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath68 combined with the previously mentioned technique to deal with the _ gauge _ issue , we will show that when we choose the euclidean vacuum , the hamiltonian density for @xmath66 , can be expressed only in terms of the ir irrelevant operators .",
    "* the ir regularity and the absence of the secular growth . * as for the third item , we evaluate the @xmath0-point function of the genuinely _ gauge _ invariant operator . performing the quantization in the canonical system of @xmath66",
    ", we will show that the ir contributions do not diverge and that the secular growth is suppressed .",
    "we carefully investigate the contributions from the modes which are comparable to or less than the hubble scale , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath69 , without employing the asymptotic expansion with respect to @xmath70 .",
    "as is stressed at the end of the preceding subsection , this point is one of the necessary ingredients to show the absence of the secular growth .",
    "one may naively expect that the uv modes with @xmath71 will not effectively contribute to the vertex integration because of the oscillatory behaviour .",
    "a more careful consideration tells us that this naive expectation is not necessarily correct . in general , vertex integrations become a mixture of the positive and negative frequency mode functions , which yields the phase in the uv limit @xmath72 where @xmath73 represents the conformal time which runs from @xmath52 to 0 .",
    "then , the phase does not necessarily exhibit the rapid oscillation even for the modes with @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , which can be a cause of secular growth .",
    "intriguingly , choosing the euclidean vacuum plays a crucial role not only in the ir limit but also in the uv limit .",
    "one can show that there is no mixing between the positive and the negative frequency modes , if we choose the euclidean vacuum .",
    "therefore , secular growth is evaded in this case . * the outline of the paper . *",

    "@xcite , in calculating @xmath0-point functions , we used the retarded green function to solve the non - linear heisenberg equation .",
    "this is because we thought that using the retarded green function , whose fourier mode is regular in the ir limit , makes the proof of the ir regularity transparent .",
    "however , the perturbative expansion using the retarded green function is not suitable for the present purpose , because the positive and negative frequency modes are mixed in the vertex integrations once the retarded green function is used .",
    "therefore , the boundary conditions of the euclidean vacuum does not guarantee the convergence of the time integrations for all the vertices . by contrast ,",
    "when we calculate the @xmath0-point functions in the in - in formalism , all vertex integrals can be made manifestly convergent by adopting the boundary conditions of the euclidean vacuum ( see sec .  [",

    "i.e. , _ @xmath315 . we naively expect that in this case , the euclidean vacuum is the unique possibility .",

    "we introduce a new operator @xmath318 with an arbitrary choice of the ir suppression operator @xmath319 where @xmath170 is just the label for distinction .",

    ", one can construct various excited states that are ir regular and free from the secular growth .",
    "in the recent papers  @xcite , the absence of the secular growth is also claimed .",
    "it would be profitable to give a comparison between these works and our current work .",
    "first , in these papers , the item 1 raised in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , _",
    "i.e. , _ the presence of the canonical system , which is equivalent to the original canonical system and whose interaction hamiltonian is composed only of the ir irrelevant operators , is postulated , while this is not automatically guaranteed from the symmetry of the classical system .",
    "second , in these papers , the mode function in de sitter spacetime , whose amplitude is given by a constant hubble parameter , is used in proving the conservation of the curvature perturbation .",
    "this leads to the quantitative discrepancy in the evaluation of the secular growth from ours .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the locality of the solution @xmath326 given in eq .  ( 22 ) of the paper is crucial in their proof .",
    "however , the locality is not necessarily valid , once we take into account the fact that in the chaotic inflation , the amplitude of the fluctuation becomes larger and larger in the distant past as @xmath327 .",
    "when we neglect this effect by setting @xmath328 in eq .",
    "( [ exp : ccond ] ) to constant , the convergence condition is always satisfied ( unless the interaction coefficient @xmath329 , composed of the horizon flow functions , varies rapidly ) .",
    "therefore our result does not contradict to the conservation of the curvature perturbation that they claimed .",
    "the third point is about the treatment of the uv contributions . in this paper , we have not directly discussed about the uv renormalization .",
    "we simply assumed that the uv divergent contributions , which are shown to be localized to the region where the two arguments of the wightman functions are mutually almost light - like , can be renormalized by introducing the local counter terms .",
    "as long as the renormalization does not break the dilatation symmetry of the classical action , our discussion can hold .",
    "recently , an interesting investigation about the uv renormalization is pursued in ref .",
    "it is claimed that a decaying composite operator in the free theory is kept decaying also after the renormalization of loops .",
    "although the non - trivial assumptions such as the locality must be removed or verified , if this statement is correct , the conservation of the curvature perturbation can be shown also in the presence of the loop corrections .",
    "we should , however , emphasize that the conservation of the curvature perturbation does not prohibit the appearance of the logarithmic amplification , as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "finally , we also make a comment on the recent progress regarding the ir issues of a test field in the exact de sitter spacetime , which can be interpreted as an approximation to the entropy mode .",
    "the regularity of the loop corrections for the euclidean vacuum is shown for the massive scalar field by s.  hollands  @xcite and independently by d.  marolf and i.  morrison  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , for a massless scalar field , the ir regularity has not been shown and the absence of the secular growth is unclear  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "although the adiabatic curvature perturbation is a sort of massless field in the sense that the wightman function @xmath330 possesses the ir divergence and the long term correlation , the operation of the ir suppressing operators @xmath204 , which appear by virtue of the residual _ gauge _ symmetry and by choosing the euclidean vacuum , cures the singular behaviour .",
