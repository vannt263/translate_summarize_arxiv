    "the presence of the off - diagonal components of the multidimensional ( md ) metric can essentially change the properties of the appropriate md gravitational equations .",
    "the physical reason for this is evident : these components of the md metric are connected with the physical gauge fields ( electromagnetic or yang - mills gauge fields ) and excluding the physical fields can lead to this essential change .",
    "let us repeat the following theorem @xcite , @xcite :    let @xmath0 be a structural group of the principal bundle .",
    "then there is a one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath0-invariant metrics @xmath1 ^ 2 + g_{\\mu\\nu}(x^\\alpha ) dx ^\\mu dx^\\nu \\label{1 - 1}\\ ] ] on the total space @xmath2 and the triples @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the 4d einstein s pseudo - riemannian metric on the base ; @xmath5 are the gauge fields of the group @xmath0 ( the nondiagonal components of the multidimensional metric ) ; @xmath6 is the symmetric metric on the fibre ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 dim @xmath0 is the index on the fibre and @xmath9 is the index on the base ) .    according to this theorem we have the following independent degrees of freedom : the scalar field @xmath10 , the gauge fields @xmath11 and the 4d metric @xmath12 .",
    "note that all fields in this md gravity can depend only on the spacetime points ( points on the base ) as the total space is @xmath0-invariant .",
    "such kind of md gravity can easily solve the following problem : why the physical degrees of freedom do not depend on the extra dimensions ( ed ) .",
    "in addition to this , a topological structure of the ed is given that leads to a decrease of the numbers of equations connected with the ed in comparison with an ordinary md gravity with non - fixed ed .",
    "usually , the number of these equations is too large : this results in essential problems with the compactification .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to introduce some external fields in order to have a compactified ed . in our case",
    "the vacuum md gravitational equations is sufficient to obtain the solutions with the compactified ed . in md gravity on the principal",
    "bundle the preferable choice of the coordinate transformations is @xmath13 here @xmath14 are the coordinates on the fibre and @xmath15 are the coordinates on the base .",
    "the first term in ( [ 6 ] ) means that the choice of coordinate system on the fibre is arbitrary .",
    "the second term indicates that in addition we can move the origin of the coordinate system on each fibre on the value @xmath16 .",
    "it is well known that such a transformation law ( [ 6 ] ) leads to a local gauge transformation for the appropriate non - abelian field ( see for overview @xcite ) .",
    "that means , the coordinate transformation ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) are the most _ natural _ transformations for the md gravitation on the principal bundle .",
    "certainly we can perform the much more general coordinate transformations : @xmath17 but in this case we will mix the points of the fibre with the points of the base . then the new coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not the coordinates along the fibre and the base of the given bundle .",
    "we can introduce the new coordinates and kill the @xmath20 .",
    "but in this case the initial 4d metric can be changed very radical .",
    "for example , the initial static spherically symmetric 4d metric can become nonstatic and nondiagonal .",
    "this situation is very clear in the initial kaluza interpretation of 5d gravity with the constant and nonvariable @xmath21 component of the metric . in this case",
    "we have the ordinary vacuum electrogravity which is equivalent to the 5d gravity with the nondynamical @xmath21 component of md metric .",
    "and we can choose the new coordinates @xmath22 so that the initial 5d metric : @xmath23 will be @xmath24 evidently metric ( [ 1 - 3 ] ) will be nonstatic , nondiagonal and depend on the 5@xmath25 coordinate .",
    "of course , the new coordinate system @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is worse than the initial @xmath28 .",
    "this remark allow us to say that the md metric with the off - diagonal components of the metric @xmath29 can have unusual properties in comparison with the solutions where @xmath30 .",
    "here we will consider the md gravity on the principal bundle with su(2 ) structural group . in this case",
    "the extra dimensions is su(2 ) group sphere . ] and the 4d physical spacetime is the base of this bundle . we will search a solution for the following 7d metric @xmath31 here @xmath32 is some constant , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are the maurer - cartan form with relation @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the euler angles .",
    "we choose the potential @xmath20 in the ordinary monopole - like form @xmath38 let us introduce the color electric @xmath39 and magnetic @xmath40 fields @xmath41 here the field strength components are defined via @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the determinant of the 3d space matrix , ( @xmath44 ) are the space index . in our case",
    "we have @xmath45 in order to have the wormhole - like ( wh ) solution we must demand that the functions @xmath46 are even functions and @xmath47 is an odd function .",
    "this means that at origin ( @xmath48 ) we have only the radial @xmath49 and @xmath50 fields that indicate the presence of a flux tube of color electric and magnetic fields across the throat of this wh - like solution .",
    "the substitution to the 7d gravitational equations is given in the appendix . ]",
    "@xmath51 leads to the following system of equations @xmath52 note that the equations ( [ 2 - 14 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 15 ] ) are the  yang - mills \" equations .",
    "this system of ordinary differential equations is extremely difficult for the analytical investigation .",
    "( flux tube solution @xcite ) . ]",
    "therefore we will search for a numerical solution of this system .",
    "now we must write the initial conditions . at the origin ( @xmath48 )",
    "we can expand all functions by this manner @xmath53 here we introduce the dimensionless coordinate @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and redefine @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58",

    "the numerical calculations of eq.s ( [ 2 - 11])-([2 - 15 ] ) are presented in the figs . 1 - 5 .",
    "the initial data for these calculations are the following : @xmath64 .",
    "figs . 1 - 5 show us that in accordance with some relation between @xmath61 and @xmath62 there are two types of solutions :    1 .",
    "there exists some value of the radial coordinate @xmath65 that @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "probably this means that at @xmath68 points we have a singularity .",
    "this 4d part of the md metric we can name as gravitational flux tube . as we have some flux of color electric / magnetic field between the points @xmath69 and @xmath70 where the color electric / magnetic charges are located .",

    "the value @xmath73 means that the interval @xmath74 on the hypersurface @xmath75 .",
    "since the value of @xmath76 is finite we can name this type of the solutions as the wh - like .",

    "wh - like solution located between two @xmath74 hypersurfaces .",
    "* e = h*. infinite flux tube with constant electric and magnetic fields .",
    "* e @xmath82 h*. finite flux tube located between two singularities at points @xmath68 where are the electric and magnetic charges .    in the first 5d case the solution exists for @xmath83 where @xmath84 and the metric is asymptotically flat .",
    "the whole construction can be interpreted as the euclidean wh with the lorentzian throat @xcite .",
    "the question is : whether this situation can be kept in the 7d case for the second type of the solutions ? in ref",
    "s @xcite , @xcite a similar idea had been investigated about the changing of the signature of the 4d metric in some md metric on the regular @xmath85-hole horizon .    also in our case",
    "the numerical calculations show that on the @xmath86 plane there is a curve that separates regions with the different solution type .",
    "evidently , in the first rough approximation the equation for this curve is @xmath87 in fig .",
    "6 these regions with the different type of solutions are shown .    in the @xmath86 plane",
    "we can single out a few cases allowing a more detailed analysis .      immediately from the `` yang - mills '' equations ( [ 2 - 14 ] ) , ( [ 2 - 15 ] ) we see that @xmath89 all terms with gauge fields in ( [ 2 - 11])-([2 - 15a ] ) vanish , and at the origin @xmath90 the equation for the initial data give us @xmath91 as @xmath92 this relation can not be satisfied .",
    "this allows us to say that _ in the absence of the gauge fields ( off - diagonal components of the md metric ) the gravitational flux tubes and wh - like solutions do not exist_.      in this case ( [ 2 - 14 ] ) equation is easy to integrate @xmath94 and from ( [ 2 - 7 ] ) , ( [ 2 - 8 ] ) we see that there are only the radial color component of the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "it is very interesting to note that there is some very simple analytical solution in the case @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "the solution is @xmath96 we can apply the following gauge transformation to the potentials of eqs .",
    "( [ 2 - 2 ] - [ 2 - 4 ] ) with @xmath97 @xmath98 where @xmath99 with this gauge transformation we find that the gauge potentials become @xmath100 in fact this means that the potential ( [ 3 - 13])-([3 - 15 ] ) is an abelian one .",
    "this solution corresponds to the points @xmath101 and @xmath102 in fig .",
    "6 and we can call it an _ infinite gravitational flux tube . _ it is very close to the levi - civita - robinson - bertotti solution @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in 4d electrogravity .",
    "this remark poses a very interesting problem : how are the other solutions on the curve @xmath103 @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "6 ) ? are these solutions infinite flux tubes or something else ?    for the question which other lie groups can lead to similar results we can say that for any @xmath105 there is an inclusion su@xmath106 .",
    "this means that for any such su@xmath107 we can use the ansatz ( [ 2 - 2])-([2 - 4 ] ) .",
    "as one knows , also all other compact semi - simple lie groups ( besides u(1 ) , of course ) , have su(2 ) as one of their subgroups .",
    "therefore , for all these lie groups similar statements are also valid . for the other lie groups it is complicated to find out the spherically symmetric ansatz for the off - diagonal components of the md metric .",
    "we would like to point out the following dimensional reduction expression for the ricci scalar @xmath108 on the total space of the principal bundle @xmath109 \\label{3 - 16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath110 are the ricci scalars of the base and structural group of the principal bundle respectively ; @xmath111 is the volume of the group @xmath0 , cf .",
    "@xcite , eq . ( 8.12 ) .",
    "immediately we see that for an arbitrary lie group @xmath0 we face the problem of how to get the appropriate ansatz for the gauge field @xmath20 .",
    "in this context it should be noted that also in the models discussed here , a generalized birkhoff theorem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is valid .",
    "this means that a spherically symmetric solution possesses a further isometry without additional assumptions .",
    "of course , this result rests on the symmetries chosen for our model .",
    "probably , the most interesting above - mentioned solution in 7d gravity on the principal bundle with the su(2 ) structural group is the wh - like solution .",
    "we remember that if the @xmath112 components of the md metric are not the dynamical variables then this md gravity is equivalent to the pure 4d gravity + su(2 ) yang - mills theory . it can be supposed that in the universe there exist regions where the @xmath112 metric components are nondynamical variables and that there exist other regions where these components are dynamical variables .",
    "the composite wh can be of such a kind .",
    "it means that we have our above - mentioned wh - like solution as a throat of composite wh and two 4d yang - mills black holes attached to this throat ( see fig .",
    "such construction can polarize a space - time foam by the following way @xcite . without presence of the 7d ( 5d ) throat the handles of the space - time foam are located disordered in the space - time ( fig .",
    "8a ) . but after the appearance of the throat of composite wh the location of these handles is ordered ( fig .",
    "such model can be a geometrical model of the renormalization of the color / electric charge ( the case for the electric charge is described in @xcite ) .",
    "this composite wh with the polarization of the space - time foam is a continuation of wheeler s idea about `` charge without charge '' and `` mass without mass '' in the _ vacuum _ gravity .    in this connection",
    "we can recall wheeler s quote in ref .",
    "@xcite : `` we are therefore led to consider the view that the electron is nothing but a collective state of excitation of the foam - like medium @xmath113 in other words the electron is not a natural starting point for the description of nature , according to the present reinterpretation of the views of lorentz . instead it is a first order correction to vacuum physics . that vacuum , that zero order state of affairs , with its enormous concentrations of electromagnetic energy and multiply - connected topologies , has to be described properly before one has the starting point for a proper perturbation theoretic development . '' may be all these words can be used to a neutrino with mass , i.e. neutrino is a wormhole in the polarized space - time foam . in these cases there remains to solve the problem of the geometric description of spin .",
    "a similar 6-dimensional model , called @xmath114-fluxbranes , has been discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above - mentioned gravitational flux tube solutions can not be the throat of the composite wh as they have a singularity on the place of the @xmath115 hypersurface for the wh - like solution .",
    "it imposes some restriction on the possible relation between color electric and magnetic fields in the composite wh .",
