    "quantum correlation is one of the most striking features in quantum theory .",
    "entanglement is by far the most famous and best studied kind of quantum correlation , and leads to powerful applications @xcite .",
    "another kind of quantum correlation , called quantum discord , captures more correlations than entanglement in the sense that separable states may also possess nonzero quantum discord .",
    "quantum discord has been attracted much attention in recent years , due to its theoretical interest to quantum theory , and also due to its potential applications @xcite . up to now",
    ", the studies on quantum correlations , like entanglement and quantum discord , are mainly focused on the bipartite case .",
    "quantifying the multipartite correlations is a fundamental and very intractable question .",
    "the direct idea is that we can properly generalize the quantifiers of bipartite correlations to the case of multipartite correlations @xcite .",
    "recently , generalizing the quantum discord of bipartite states to multipartite states has been discussed in different ways @xcite . as an important measure of bipartite correlations , the geometric quantum discord , proposed in @xcite , has been extensively studied @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we generalize the geometric quantum discord to multipartite states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we review the definition of geometric quantum discord for bipartite states . in sec.3 , we give the definition of geometric global quantum discord ( ggqd ) for multipartite states , and give two equivalent expressions for ggqd . in sec.4 , we provide a lower bound for ggqd by using the high order singular value decomposition of tensors . in sec.5",
    ", we obtain the analytical expressions of ggqd for three classes of states .",
    "sec.6 is a brief summary .",
    "the original quantum discord was defined for bipartite systems over all projective measurements performing only on one subsystem @xcite .",
    "that is , the quantum discord ( with respect to @xmath0 ) of a bipartite state @xmath1 of the composite system @xmath2 ( we suppose @xmath3 @xmath4 ) was defined as @xmath5 in eq.(1 ) , @xmath6 is von neumann entropy , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a projective measurement performing on @xmath0 , @xmath9 is the abbreviation of @xmath10 without any confusion , here @xmath11 is the identity operator of system @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath13=tr_{b}[\\pi _ { a}(\\rho _ { ab})]$ ] , that is , taking partial trace and performing local projective measurement can exchange the ordering .",
    "it can be proved that @xmath14 where , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is any orthonormal basis of system @xmath0 , @xmath17 are density operators of system @xmath12 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the original definition of quantum discord in eq.(1 ) is hard to calculate , even for 2-qubit case , by far we only know a small class of states which allow analytical expressions @xcite .",
    "dakic , vedral , and brukner proposed the geometric quantum discord , as @xcite @xmath20:d_{a}(\\sigma _ { ab})=0\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , @xmath21    for many cases @xmath22 is more easy to calculate than @xmath23 since @xmath22 avoided the complicated entropy function .",
    "for instance , @xmath22 allows analytical expressions for all 2-qubit states @xcite , and also for all @xmath24 @xmath25 states @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the authors generalized the original definition of quantum discord to multipartite states , called global quantum discord ( gqd ) .",
    "consider an @xmath26-partite @xmath27 system , each subsystem @xmath28 @xmath29 corresponds hilbert space @xmath30 with dim@xmath31 ( we suppose @xmath32 ) .",
    "the gqd of an @xmath26-partite state @xmath33 is defined as ( here we use an equivalent expression for gqd @xcite ) @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath35 is a locally projective measurement on @xmath36 .",
    "similar to eqs.(2 , 3 ) , we have lemma 1 below .    _ lemma 1 .",
    "_ @xmath37 where , @xmath38 is any orthonormal basis of @xmath30 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .    _",
    "_ eq.(7 ) is proved in @xcite .",
    "eq.(8 ) can be proved as follows .",
    "noting that @xmath42 , then by eq.(3 ) and induction , eq.(8 ) can be proved .",
    "with lemma 1 , in the same spirit of defining geometric quantum discord for bipartite states in eq.(4 ) , we now define the ggqd below .    _ definition 1 . _",
    "the ggqd of state @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44^{2}:d(\\sigma _",
    "{ a_{1}a_{2} ... a_{n}})=0\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with this definition , it is obvious that @xmath45    in @xcite , two equivalent expressions for eq.(4 ) were given ( theorem 1 and theorem 2 in @xcite ) , and they are very useful for simplifying the calculation of eq.(4 ) and yielding lower bound of eq.(4 ) @xcite .",
    "inspired by this observation , we now derive the corresponding versions of these two equivalent expressions for ggqd .",
    "these are theorem 1 and theorem 2 below .    _ theorem 1 .",
    "_ @xmath46 is defined as in eq.(9 ) , then @xmath47^{2}\\ }        \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",
    "\\nonumber    \\\\     \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ = tr[\\rho _ { a_{1}a_{2} ... a_{n}}]^{2}-\\max_{\\pi } \\{tr[\\pi ( \\rho _ { a_{1}a_{2} ... a_{n}})]^{2}\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath48 is any locally projective measurement performing on @xmath49    _ proof . _ in eq.(9 ) , for any @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 , @xmath50 can be expressed in the form latexmath:[\\ ] ] and the minimum can be achieved by taking @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "we then proved eq.(41 ) .",
    "we make some remarks . for states in eq.(29 ) and states in eq.(36 ) , the gqd can also be analytically obtained @xcite , we then can compare the gqd and ggqd for these two classes of states . for states in eq.(36 ) and states in eq.(40 ) , when @xmath127 , the ggqd in eq.(37 ) and eq.(41 ) recover the corresponding results in @xcite .",
    "we also remark that , from eq.(37 ) , let the state eq.(36 ) undergo a locally phase channel performing on any qubit , similar discussions as in @xcite show that ggqd may also manifest the phenomena of sudden transition and freeze .",
    "in summary , we generalized the geometric quantum discord of bipartite states to multipartite states , we call it geometric global quantum discord ( ggqd ) . we gave different characterizations of ggqd which provided new insights for calculating ggqd .",
    "as demonstrations , we provided a lower bound for ggqd by using the high order singular value decomposition of tensors , and obtained the analytical expressions of ggqd for three classes of multipartite states .",
    "we also pointed out that ggqd can also manifest the phenomena of sudden transition and freeze .",
    "understanding and quantifying the multipartite correlations is a very challenging question , we hope that the ggqd proposed in this paper may provide a useful attempt for this issue .",
