    "based on its superior angular resolution capabilities  namely , an on - axis point spread function ( psf ) with a half - power diameter of @xmath61@xmath12  the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory @xcite is an ideal instrument for surveying populations of discrete x - ray sources in nearby spiral galaxies . to date , numerous nearby spiral galaxies have been the subjects of deep _ chandra _ observations which have sampled their resident x - ray source populations in unprecedented detail .",
    "prominent examples of such galaxies which have been the subject of such studies include m33 @xcite , m51 @xcite , m81 @xcite , m83 @xcite , m101 @xcite , ngc 1637 @xcite , ngc 2403 @xcite , ngc 3184 @xcite , ngc 6946 @xcite and ic 5332 @xcite . in each case , the _ chandra _ observations have dramatically increased the numbers of known discrete x - ray sources in each galaxy .",
    "the applications of these observations include sampling a robust number of discrete x - ray sources for statistically - significant analyses , spatially resolving the discrete sources from a component of diffuse x - ray emission detected from some galaxies , spectral analyses of the brightest discrete sources , time variability analyses ( often incorporating observations made with previous x - ray observatories ) and measurement with high accuracy of the positions of x - ray sources for the purposes of identifying counterparts at other wavelengths .    typically , the classes of x - ray objects detected by these surveys include x - ray sources associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) and supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "observations of xrbs and snrs are essential in developing a thorough understanding of stellar evolution .",
    "unfortunately , studies of xrbs and snrs in our own galaxy are hampered by observational difficulties , including significant absorption along galactic lines of sight as well as considerable uncertainties in distances to these sources .",
    "in addition , the galactic population of xrbs and snrs represent a galaxy of a single mass , metallicity , star formation history and morphological type .",
    "observing xrbs and snrs located in nearby galaxies minimizes these issues . in prior works",
    "@xcite , we analyzed high angular resolution observations at multiple wavelengths of several nearby galaxies to both identify snrs and statistically assess their properties . in the present paper",
    "we continue this work by analyzing a _ chandra _ observation of the nearby sd galaxy ngc 7793 .",
    "this observation was conducted primarily to study x - ray emission from the snr population in ngc 7793 ; here we consider the properties of the discrete x - ray sources detected in this galaxy as well as the accompanying diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "ngc 7793 , a member of the nearby sculptor group @xcite , lies at a distance of 3.91 mpc @xcite and at an inclination angle of @xmath13@xmath650@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "general properties of both ngc 7793 and the pointed _ chandra _ observation of this galaxy are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "ngc 7793 has been the subject of prior x - ray observations made with the _ einstein _ imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) @xcite and the _ rntgensatellit _ ( _ rosat _ ) position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) ( @xcite , hereafter rp99 ) .",
    "these observations detected seven x - ray sources  including an ultra - luminous x - ray source ( ulx ) located along the southern edge of the galaxy  within the optical extent of ngc 7793 .",
    "in addition , prominent diffuse x - ray emission which permeates much of the disk of the galaxy has been detected ( rp99 ) .",
    "the snr population of ngc 7793 has been well - studied by both optical and radio surveys @xcite ; based on these searches , a total of 32 resident snrs have been identified in this galaxy . in the present paper , we will concentrate on searching for x - ray counterparts to these 32 sources . n7793-s26  an additional source that was initially classified as a snr by @xcite and detected in the radio by @xcite and @xcite  has recently been classified as a microquasar candidate by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we exclude this source from our investigation presented here of the properties of snrs in ngc 7793 and we will discuss this source ( particularly its x - ray , optical and radio properties when compared to extragalactic superbubbles ) in more detail in a future paper .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : the observations and data reduction are described in section [ obssection ] .",
    "properties of the discrete x - ray sources detected by this observation  including spectral analysis of four of the most luminous sources as well as searches for multi - wavelength counterparts and time - variable emission from all sources  are discussed in section [ discretesection ] .",
    "next we discuss the diffuse x - ray emission from ngc 7793 as sampled by this observation ( section [ diffusesection ] ) , the luminosity function of the discrete sources ( section [ lfsection ] ) and the properties of the snr population of this galaxy ( section [ snrsection ] ) . finally , we summarize our results in section [ conclusionssection ] .",
    "we used the advanced charge - coupled device ( ccd ) imaging spectrometer ( acis ) @xcite onboard _",
    "chandra _ to observe ngc 7793 .",
    "the observation was obtained in very faint mode on 2003 september 6 - 7 using an aim point approximately two arcminutes west of the nucleus , ensuring the maximum coverage of ngc 7793 across the ( back - illuminated ) acis - s3 chip .",
    "the exposure lasted approximately 49724 seconds and , after correcting for the deadtime , the effective exposure time was 49094 seconds .",
    "we accumulated source - free background areas offset from the galaxy ( namely from the back - illuminated acis - s1 chip ) and extracted a light curve using 50-second bins to test for the presence of soft background flares .",
    "no flaring behavior of any kind was detected .",
    "we re - filtered the level 1 data , correcting for the induced charge - transfer inefficiency following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "this approach permits using a single event redistribution matrix in the spectral fitting , altering the response matrix for the off - axis - dependent effective area .",
    "the data was reduced with standard tools in the software application package  _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations \" ( _ ciao _ ) version 3.4 ( caldb version 3.3.0 ) .",
    "point sources were identified using wavdetect at 1@xmath15 , 2@xmath15 , and 4@xmath15 scales @xcite .",
    "the detected sources were merged into a final source list after eliminating duplicate detections .",
    "source counts were extracted using apertures that increased with off - axis angle to ensure the inclusion of an approximately constant fraction of the psf .",
    "the minimum aperture was 2@xmath15 in diameter and enclosed @xmath1695% of the psf .",
    "these same apertures were used to extract spectra ( see section [ luminousxraysourcessection ] ) or counts for quantiles ( see section [ quantilesection ] ) , depending upon the count rate . a background spectrum was obtained from a region on the acis - s3 chip but outside of the galaxy and southeast of the nucleus .",
    "we detected 22 discrete x - ray sources within the optical extent of ngc 7793 at the @xmath63@xmath7 level or greater to a limiting unabsorbed luminosity of approximately @xmath0@xmath1 @xmath2 3 @xmath3",

    "the _ rosat _ pspc revealed seven discrete sources ( rp99 ) .",
    "similar to the previous x - ray observations ( @xcite , rp99 ) , we have not detected a central x - ray source associated with the nucleus of this galaxy to the stated limiting unabsorbed luminosity .",
    "we expect that the majority of the detected sources are resident xrbs ; other possibilities include background agns , foreground stars , and x - ray luminous snrs .",
    "table [ table3 ] lists identified counterparts to the x - ray sources as detected at multiple wavelengths : we discuss each of these associations in detail in sections [ luminousxraysourcessection ] and [ otherxraysourcessection ] .",
    "lastly , table [ table4 ] contains the spectral properties of the entire population of discrete x - ray sources based on quantiles ; these properties will be discussed in more detail in section [ quantilesection ] .",
    "inspection of figure 1 reveals a remarkable asymmetry in the distribution of the discrete x - ray sources with the large majority of the discrete sources located in the eastern half of ngc 7793 .",
    "only four of the 22 discrete x - ray sources are found in the western half and there is a stark absence of discrete sources in the northwestern quadrant .",
    "einstein _ and _ rosat _ observations ( @xcite , rp99 ) also did not detect any discrete sources in this quadrant .",
    "we discuss this asymmetry more thoroughly in section [ asymmetrysubsection ] .      for four of the 22 discrete x - ray sources , there were sufficient counts above our arbitrary limit of 200 counts ( corresponding to a count rate of @xmath64@xmath310@xmath21 counts per second ) to extract spectra and generate spectral fits that yielded parameters which were measured to @xmath2230% .",
    "we now discuss general properties of each of these four sources : properties of the other discrete sources are presented in section [ otherxraysourcessection ] . in each case , the spectra were fit using the software package _ xspec _",
    "version 11.3.1 @xcite : the individual spectra were grouped to a minimum of 25 counts per bin and each spectrum was fit over the energy range where there were a sufficient number of counts .",
    "we have not performed any fits to the x - ray spectrum of the source cxou j235752.7@xmath10323309 even though the number of counts detected from this source exceed the threshold stated above because this source is physically associated with a foreground star ( see section [ otherxraysourcessection ] ) .",
    "we used four basic models to fit each extracted spectrum : a simple power law model , a bremsstrahlung model @xcite , the apec model , an optically thin thermal plasma model known as the apec model @xcite , and finally the diskbb model @xcite .",
    "this last model describes the spectrum from an accretion disk consisting of multiple blackbody components and is characterized by the temperature @xmath23@xmath24 at the inner disk radius . to account for photoelectric absorption along the line of sight we used the wisconsin cross - section models @xcite",
    "there are two choices possible when fitting the column density : fixing it at the value of the known galactic column density in the pointing direction ( that is , @xmath17@xmath25 = 1.15@xmath310@xmath19 @xmath20 ) or treating it as a free parameter . with this in mind",
    ", we performed fits to the extracted spectra using the four models first with the column density frozen to the known galactic column and then with the column density left as a free parameter .",
    "lastly , a background spectrum was extracted using an aperture 0.7 arcmin in diameter and positioned off the optical extent of the galaxy .",
    "no point sources were included in this aperture .",
    "the resulting spectrum extracted from this aperture was accurately fit using a combination of a power law component and gaussians . in table",
    "[ table4 ] , we present a representative summary of our derived best fits and not the results of every fit that we attempted obtained for each model .",
    "the background spectrum itself and best - fit model were then included in the fits to each point source without adjusting the background model fit components .    in general , the basic models return statistically acceptable fits for each source . in some cases , a particular spectrum warranted a more complex model to obtain a satisfactory fit .",
    "also , in some cases significant statistical differences in the fits were seen when the column density was frozen or thawed : below we discuss specific results for fitting the extracted spectra .",
    "the spectra of two of these sources were also analyzed by rp99 : we also compare our derived fits with the fits obtained by those authors .",

    "@xcite proposed that this x - ray source and the candidate radio snr are physically associated based on their positional proximity .",
    "rp99 commented on the soft nature of the _ rosat _ pspc spectrum of this source .",
    "based on this soft spectrum , a lack of apparent variability in the x - ray emission ( between two epochs of _ rosat _ observations ) and its positional association with a portion of ngc 7793 that features numerous snrs , rp99 speculated that this x - ray source may be a superbubble or the collective x - ray emission from multiple snrs .",
    "our fits indicate a moderately - hard spectrum for this source . the bremsstrahlung temperature is higher than that of rp99 ( @xmath8 @xmath6 1.6 kev compared to @xmath8 @xmath6 0.8 kev ) , although the error bars overlap the fitted values .",

    "the fitted column density is consistent with the known column toward ngc 7793 .",
    "if we fix the column density to the known column , the impact is largely confined to the power law model : the power law index @xmath26 falls from 2.9 to 1.7 with a slight overlap in the error bars ; for the other models , the fitted parameters differ by @xmath2210% .",
    "all models ( with the exception of the apec model ) require the addition of two zero - width gaussians to model line - like features .",
    "the gaussians have line centers at 0.94 and 1.46 kev and the equivalent widths of these lines are largest in the power law model , with values of 111 and 102 ev , respectively .    the normalization of the diskbb model is defined as [ ( @xmath27@xmath28/km)/(@xmath29/10 kpc)]@xmath30 where @xmath27@xmath28 is the inner disk radius in km and @xmath29 is the distance to the source in units of 10 kpc .",
    "the fitted normalization then corresponds to 26@xmath31 km , a value larger than is generally deemed typical of neutron stars but falling within inferred radii of other low - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in figures",

    "we note that we have detected a clear variability in the x - ray emission from this source . the prior _ rosat _ pspc observations of this galaxy reported by rp99 caught this source in a brighter state than our _ chandra _ observation by a factor of approximately three .",
    "this time - variability  coupled with the high x - ray luminosity and the moderately hard spectrum observed for this source  cast doubt on the classification of this source as a single snr .",
    "alternatively , cxou j235746.7@xmath10323607 may be an snr / xrb system analogous to the galactic source w50/ss 433 @xcite , though the observed x - ray luminosity of the former source is several orders of magnitudes greater than the latter source .",
    "it is possible that the observed x - ray emission stems from a complex of sources which remain unresolved even with the high angular resolution capabilities of _ chandra_. the classification of cxou j235746.7@xmath10323607 is therefore currently uncertain and we will discuss this source again in section [ variabilitysection ] when we discuss a search for time - variability in the x - ray emission from the detected discrete x - ray sources and in section [ snrsection ] when we describe properties of the snr population of this galaxy .",

    "rp99 described time variability in the source s emission by comparing observations made six months apart and speculated that the source may be either a background galaxy or a black hole x - ray binary with an estimated mass of @xmath6 10 @xmath32@xmath33 .",

    "there are several possible physical interpretations possible for other the sources that belong in group ( i ) .",
    "if an h  ii region contains an snr , then the separation of the group ( i ) points from the h  ii regions in group ( ii ) may result from the strong line emission present in the spectrum of the snr ; the excess absorption could be explained as circumstellar matter or recombining nucleosynthesized matter .",
    "alternatively , if the h  ii region contains the remains of a massive star , the emission would be expected to be much harder if dominated by an xrb and hence the point would appear lower in the plot ( that is , at higher @xmath8 ) .",
    "we suspect that the group ( i ) points are mainly snrs or other emission - line sources : alternatively , these sources may also be xrbs illuminating adjacent clouds of interstellar material in ngc 7793 .",
    "we note that strong emission line sources are more difficult to interpret correctly using the quantile approach because strong , low - energy line emission ( at ccd spectral resolution ) can mimic a source with a continuous spectrum and _ lower _ column density .",
    "to investigate time variability from the discrete x - ray source population of ngc 7793 , we examined two approaches : flux differences between our _ chandra _ observation and the _ rosat _ pspc observation of rp99 as well as variability within the _ chandra _ observation itself . for the differences in flux between the two observation epochs",
    ", we must consider the flux differences between sources detected by both rp99 and the present work , sources detected by rp99 but not detected by the present work , and sources detected by the present work but not by rp99 .",
    "we adopted a common energy range ( 0.2 - 2.4 kev ) to make the flux comparisons as well as a commmon spectral model ( that is , an absorbed power law ) .",
    "we note that we have recovered all of the rp99 sources .",
    "we have found only one _ chandra _ source that should have been detected by rp99 if it were active during the _ rosat _ pspc observation , namely cxou j235806.6@xmath10323757 ( see section [ luminousxraysourcessection ] ) .",
    "we considered the seven discrete x - ray sources detected both in this paper and by rp99 .",
    "table [ table6 ] presents estimates for the _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ luminosities of these sources using a power law model with a photon index @xmath9=1.5 and a column density of @xmath17@xmath18=1.15@xmath310@xmath19 @xmath20 . for cxou j235746.7@xmath10323607",
    "we also included a luminosity estimate based upon the _ einstein _ observation of this source as described by @xcite and designated in that work as 2e 2355.2 - 3253 .",
    "precise comments for time variability are hampered by the lower quality psf of _ rosat _ relative to _",
    "chandra_. the broader psf of _ rosat _ mixed diffuse emission into the discrete emission , raising the overall count rate as well as altering the nature of the spectrum , depending upon the size of the counts aperture used .",
    "the presence of the mixing may be noted because all of our _ chandra _ luminosity estimates are at least 10% lower than the _ rosat _ values .",
    "regardless , several sources stand out and merit a brief discussion .",
    "cxou j235806.6 - 323757 should have been detected , implying at least an increase in flux by a factor of @xmath630 - 50 .",
    "cxou 235748.6 - 323234 decreased by a factor of @xmath620 while cxou j235800.1 - 323325 decreased by a factor of @xmath66 - 7 .",
    "we therefore identify a total of three variable discrete x - ray sources in ngc 7793 : the remaining sources decreased by modest amounts ( factors of @xmath62 ) or are constant within the errors .",
    "to test for variability within the _ chandra _ observation , we used the standard _",
    "ciao _ tools to first barycenter the data and then extract light curves for each detected point source .",
    "the light curves were binned into 60-second intervals and these binned light curves were then run through a bayesian variability detector ( the ciao tool glvary ) .",
    "none of the sources exhibited statistically significant variability .",
    "an examination of each light curve verified that the light curves of all of the discrete sources were constant within the errors .",
    "we noted above that a majority of the point sources are located in the eastern half of the galaxy and none are located in the northwestern quadrant .",
    "such a peculiar distribution of sources is difficult to reconcile with the general orderly and symmetric optical appearance of the galaxy .",
    "explanations for such a distribution include an excess absorption toward the northwestern quadrant of the galaxy , a random probability in the distribution of the sources , a gravitational interaction between ngc 7793 and another galaxy , dramatically lower effective exposure on this portion of the chip during the observation and  patchy \" star formation activity in ngc 7793 .",
    "we rule out an excess absorption toward the northwest quadrant based on inspection of maps of dust column density toward ngc 7793 as provided by @xcite .",
    "these maps indicate a dust differential measure of only 2% across the face of ngc 7793 , which is insufficient to account for the observed asymmetry .",
    "we consider the other four explanations here in turn .",
    "we first consider a strictly random interpretation , that is , if most of the sources are x - ray transients , by chance we observed ngc 7793 at an epoch where sources in the northwestern portion of the galaxy were in an off state .",
    "consider , for example , treating ngc 7793 as a dartboard .",
    "noting that approximately one - quarter of the galaxy is devoid of point sources , we can calculate the probability ( based on areas ) that 20 point sources land outside one quadrant to be @xmath6(3/4)@xmath19 @xmath2 3@xmath310@xmath21 . if we instead consider on - and - off variability and assume that approximately eight sources in one quadrant must be ",
    "off\",20 @xmath2 28 sources in the whole galaxy . ]",
    "the probability of not detecting any source at all in this quadrant is @xmath6(1/2)@xmath60 @xmath2 4@xmath310@xmath21 .",
    "we readily acknowledge the _ a posteriori _ nature of our argument but we nonetheless consider the orders of magnitude instructive . having stated our interpretation , the difficulty with this interpretation is the lack of sources in the northwest quadrant in all of the prior _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ observations as well as the _ chandra _ observation considered here .",
    "this result makes an explanation based on short - term time - variability of the discrete x - ray sources less likely .",
    "a gravitational interaction with another member ( or multiple galaxies ) of the sculptor group is another possibility for explaining the asymmetry : such an interaction should also trigger enhanced massive star formation within ngc 7793 .",
    "the signposts of an elevated star formation rate have been revealed by numerous observations of ngc 7793 including copious amounts of diffuse radio continuum emission and diffuse [ s ii ] emission from the galaxy s disk @xcite , the elevated infrared and blue luminosities of this galaxy for its hubble type @xcite and the considerable population of resident ob associations and hii regions @xcite .    we have inspected tabulated information and distribution maps of the sculptor group member galaxies as provided by @xcite and @xcite to identify a galaxy ( or galaxies ) which may be interacting with ngc 7793 .",

    "is presented by @xcite , who argue that the sdig and a second dwarf galaxy ( ua 442 ) are companions to ngc 7793 based on similar measured radial velocities for all three galaxies .",
    "ngc 55 , the nearest major sculptor group spiral galaxy to ngc 7793 , does not appear to be interacting significantly with ngc 7793 .",
    "while the hi mass of ngc 55 ( 9@xmath310@xmath62 m@xmath33 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) more closely matches the hi mass of ngc 7793 , the projected distance from ngc 7793 is rather large ( 2.1 mpc ) if a distance of 1.8 mpc to ngc 55 is assumed @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite argue that ngc 55 is instead associated with a third major sculptor group spiral galaxy ngc 300 .",
    "this conclusion was also reached by @xcite , who have separately derived a distance of 1.9 mpc to ngc 55 .",
    "we can quantify the likelihood of an interaction between ngc 7793 and either the sdig or ngc 55 by calculating the tidal index @xmath63 @xcite , which may be defined as follows .",
    "if @xmath32 is the mass of the galaxy which is suspected of interacting with a galaxy of interest and @xmath29 is the three - dimensional separation between that galaxy and the galaxy of interest , then @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a constant equal to @xmath1011.75 when @xmath32 is expressed in units of solar masses and @xmath29 is expressed in units of megaparsecs . if @xmath63 is calculated to be less than zero , then it may be safely concluded that the galaxy of interest and the suspected interacting galaxy are not in fact interacting to a significant extent .",
    "we calculate values for @xmath63 = -3.14 and @xmath63 = -3.76 in the cases of ngc 55 interacting with ngc 7793 and the sdig interacting with ngc 7793 , respectively . based on these strongly negative values for the tidal index in both cases",
    ", we conclude that a gravitational interaction is an unlikely explanation for the observed asymmetry . separately , we have also inspected galex data for ngc 7793 to search for any obvious asymmetry in the ultraviolet morphology of the galaxy ( as might be expected by lopsided star formation ) but we find no evidence for an asymmetric appearance at that wavelength .    next , we considered the possibility that the effective exposure time of the portion of the acis - s3 chip that sampled the northwestern quadrant of ngc 7793 was significantly lower than for the rest of the chip , thereby leading to an observed deficit of discrete x - ray sources in this part of the galaxy . in figure",
    "[ fig11 ] , we present a contour plot showing the effective exposure for the acis - s3 chip during the observation : for illustrative purposes , we also include the positions of the detected discrete x - ray sources , the location of the aimpoint for the observation and finally an ellipse that spans the optical extent of the galaxy .",
    "we argue that in fact the effective exposure time for this portion of the chip is not significantly lower than for the rest of the chip and that therefore a different effective exposure time can not account for the observed asymmetry of the detected discrete x - ray sources .",
    "lastly , regarding the  patchy \" star formation scenario , we have also considered the work of @xcite , who described how the star formation activity in ngc 7793 is stochastic and occurs only in large irregular  patches \" ; such  patchy \" activity may also explain the observed asymmetric distribution of sources .",
    "@xcite accurately modeled the star formation activity in this galaxy using a stochastic self - propagating star formation model without an imposed spiral modulation .",
    "those authors also commented that  flocculent \" galaxies such as ngc 7793 ( as described by * ? ? ? * ) in general lack spiral modulation to star formation and feature a  patchy \" arm structure .",
    "the lack of spiral modulation in ngc 7793 is also supported by the absence of prominent emission from the galaxy s nucleus at any wavelength . if the star formation in the northwest quadrant happened to belong to one large `` patch , '' then the lack of x - ray sources not only at the _ chandra _ epoch but also at the epochs of the prior x - ray observations can be explained .",
    "however , this scenario lacks the full status of an explanation given that we do not have a method to date such a  patch . \"    therefore , at the present time we can not provide a clear explanation for the observed asymmetry of discrete x - ray sources in ngc 7793 .",
    "random probability seems more likely than such explanations such as a gravitational interaction with another galaxy or stochastic star formation but additional study and analysis is required .",
    "a spectrum of the diffuse emission was extracted following the method described by @xcite .",
    "point sources were removed by screening out all events within a radius that enclosed @xmath1695% of the psf at the detected position of each point source .",
    "the screening radius was increased to match the increase in the psf with off - axis angle .",
    "the resulting holes were filled in by randomly selecting from an annulus surrounding each source the approximate number of events that would have been present based on the count rate in the annulus .",
    "this process assumes only spectral and spatial uniformity of the diffuse emission on spatial scales of @xmath620 - 30@xmath15 .",
    "the inner radius of the annulus used for the back - fill was twice the outer diameter of the source screening radius to reduce the probability that the selected events were point source events scattered by the wings of the psf .",
    "the annulus was 20@xmath15 wide .",
    "annulus overlaps with other point sources were minimal , but were avoided by sampling events from the non - overlapping portions of the annulus .",
    "a radial profile of the diffuse emission was obtained from azimuthal sums in 10@xmath15-wide annuli centered on the nucleus .",
    "the diffuse spectrum was then extracted using an aperture with a radius of @xmath63@xmath66.7 determined by the point at which the diffuse profile joined the local ( non - galaxy ) background .",
    "an estimate of the impact of the backfill may be determined by summing the extraction areas of the point sources and dividing by the extraction area of the entire galaxy . for ngc 7793 ,",
    "those values are 1900 arcsec@xmath30 and 1.55@xmath6710@xmath68 arcsec@xmath30 , respectively , for an impact ratio of @xmath61.2% .",
    "the spectral fit of the diffuse emission spectrum was carried out in two steps .",
    "first , the background was fit using a variety of continuum and line features to achieve a good fit as described in @xcite .",
    "second , the diffuse spectrum + background was fit simultaneously with the background by adopting for the background the best - fit parameters determined in the first step . a version of the optically - thin thermal plasma model apec @xcite which is known as  vapec \" and which includes variable elemental abundances as determined using recent atomic physics was used to fit the spectrum .",
    "abundances were allowed to vary but if an abundance was found to have an error that included unity , the abundance value was reset and fixed at unity .",
    "the known absorbing column density toward ngc 7793 was adopted and the corresponding fit parameter was fixed at that value . the background spectrum contained a large fluorescent si feature at @xmath61.78 kev .",
    "the background fit easily matched the data , but the result slightly over - corrected the source spectrum because of photon statistics .",
    "we excised the data at this location : this excision has a negligible effect on the fit as the dominant emission from the hot gas occurs in the 0.5 - 1 kev band .",
    "we also included a power law component to account for any hard emission present from unresolved point sources .",
    "the results of our fits are summarized in table [ diffuse - fit ] .    in figure [ fig12 ]",
    "we present the extracted spectrum of the diffuse emission as fit with the vapec model .",
    "the fitted temperature of the diffuse spectrum of ngc 7793 was found to be @xmath8 = 0.19@xmath69 kev and @xmath17@xmath42 = 3.6@xmath6710@xmath38 @xmath20 , @xmath8 = 0.22@xmath700.02 kev for the dual apec fit , or @xmath8",

    "a circle enclosing 90% of the flux was 0.9@xmath49 in diameter at 1 kev but 2.7@xmath49 in diameter at 1.7 kev .",
    "rp99 adopted an aperture of 1@xmath49 so sources with harder spectra and hence larger psfs would preferentially contribute flux above a psf radius of @xmath61.1@xmath49 .",

    "the fitted temperature of the diffuse emission is similar to the results from fits to the diffuse components of other nearby galaxies : in table  [ diffuse - table ] we list several values measured for the diffuse emission from other galaxies for comparison .",
    "ngc 7793 stands out for the absence of a second , hotter diffuse component .",
    "we attempted to fit a second apec model ( i.e. , vapec + vapec + power law ) , but the model normalization of the second apec component was consistent with zero .",
    "a second apec component was non - zero only if the @xmath17@xmath42 was fixed at the known galactic column .",
    "we expect that a longer exposure would lead to sufficient statistics to separate a hot component from the background emission without the necessity of additional model constraints .",
    "the abundance of each element was permitted to vary , but only the abundance of ne in the fixed @xmath17@xmath42 vapec model was significantly different from 1.0 : in this case , the best - fit value for the abundance was 2.23@xmath71 . in figure [ fig13 ] we present confidence contour plots for the column density and the fitted temperature for the apec fit ( left ) as well as the fitted temperature and neon abundance for the vapec fit in which the column density was fixed at the known galactic value ( right ) .",
    "we also modeled the spectrum as a sum of unresolved gaussians plus a power law with emission gaussians at 0.60 , 0.75 , and 0.89 kev , corresponding approximately to emission lines attributed to o  vii , fe  l shell , and ne  ix .",
    "the presence of these lines is expected in hot diffuse gas .",
    "the model fits ( with both @xmath17@xmath42 free and fixed ) were consistent with the apec+power law model , but applying occam s razor , this model is penalized by the extra components and constraints necessary to obtain a good fit . while the multi - gaussian fit implies the presence of specific emission lines , the vapec model provides the statistically acceptable fit and we consider it the best - fit model .    for the adopted galactic column density and the vapec model ,",

    "lastly we comment on the multi - wavelength properties of the snr population of ngc 7793 .",
    "as noted previously , prior to the present work a total of 32 snrs had been identified in this galaxy by previous surveys conducted at x - ray , optical and radio wavelengths @xcite . in section [ discretesection ] , we presented a spectral analysis of cxou j235746.7@xmath10323607 , the x - ray counterpart to the candidate radio snr r3 that was identified by @xcite and concluded that the x - ray source was time - variable .",
    "we also exclude this source from our discussion here of the multi - wavelength properties of the snr population of ngc 7793 , reducing the size of the sample of sources to 31 .    by virtue of its superior angular resolution ,",
    "_ chandra _ potentially yields a significant improvement over _ rosat _ ( which imaged ngc 7793 previously ) in studies of the snr population of an external galaxy . to identify x - ray counterparts to these known snrs ,",
    "we have cross - correlated the list of discrete x - ray sources detected in this galaxy ( see table [ table2 ] ) with the positions of the known snrs ( as described in section [ otherxraysourcessection ] ) .",
    "we have clearly detected only one additional snr , the optically - identified snr n7793-s11 , which has also been detected in the radio by @xcite . to investigate the scenario where the x - ray counterparts to the snrs may be extended and faint which could be missed by wavdetect , we extracted counts at the locations of all of the 30 remaining snrs .",
    "for the optically - identified snrs we used apertures that corresponded to the sizes of the angular extents of these snrs ( ranging in size from @xmath62@xmath12 to @xmath610@xmath12 in radius ) while for the candidate radio snrs we used apertures that were 3@xmath12 in radius .",
    "we did not detect any additional snrs to a limiting count rate of @xmath61@xmath310@xmath77 cts s@xmath5 : we note that this search is further confused by diffuse x - ray emission from the disk of ngc 7793 as well . to estimate a corresponding limiting luminosity for this count rate",
    ", we consider the work of @xcite who conducted an x - ray survey of the snr population of the nearby face - on spiral galaxy m33 with _",
    "chandra _ , known as the _ chandra _ acis survey of m33 ( chasem33  see @xcite ) .",
    "those authors assumed a soft thermal ( @xmath45 = 0.6 kev ) spectrum with a sub - solar metal abundance of 0.5 for calculating the luminosities of detected x - ray counterparts over the energy range of 0.35 - 2.0 kev . assuming the same model , considering the same energy range and adopting the nominal galactic column density toward ngc 7793 of @xmath17@xmath18 = 1.15 @xmath3 10@xmath19 @xmath20 , we calculate a limiting luminosity for our search of @xmath0@xmath1 @xmath6 7.6@xmath310@xmath78 ergs s@xmath5 . the survey conducted by @xcite identified 7 ( out of 131 snrs observed by the survey ) with x - ray luminosities in excess of this limit for a detection rate of 5% : this value closely matches our detection rate of one snr detected ( out of 31 snrs observed ) of 3% .",
    "we find therefore that we can reconcile the detection rate of x - ray counterparts to snrs in ngc 7793 with the detection rate of x - ray counterparts to snrs in m33 as presented by @xcite . for comparison purposes , we note that over ten galactic snrs are known to have unabsorbed x - ray luminosities that exceed the limiting luminosity attained by our _ chandra _ observation : it is possible that the discrepancy between ngc 7793 and the milky way may be simply due to the lower mass and star formation rate of ngc 7793 compared to the milky way .",

    "@xcite also discuss multi - wavelength properties of the sample of known snrs in m33 : those authors describe the importance of local gas density in dictating the x - ray properties of snrs as well as consider how optical morphology and environment of the snr may affect its detectability in the x - ray .",
    "the reader is referred to both of these works for a more complete discussion of multi - wavelength properties of snrs .",
    "we note that the detection of x - ray emission from n7793-s11 is significant in that this source is one of only a very few extragalactic snrs located beyond the local group which have been detected in the x - ray , optical and radio bands .",
    "the conclusions of this paper may be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) we detected 22 discrete x - ray sources within the optical extent of ngc 7793 in a 49094 sec exposure .",
    "the sources are significant at the @xmath63@xmath7 level or greater and correspond to a limiting unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath63@xmath310@xmath4 ergs s@xmath5 over the 0.2 - 10.0 kev energy range .",
    "\\2 ) four sources had a sufficient number of counts to allow spectral fitting .",
    "acceptable fits were derived using either a power law , a bremsstrahlung model , an apec model or a disk blackbody model plus zero - width gaussians to simulate unresolved lines .",
    "column densities were generally higher than the known galactic value toward ngc 7793  in fact , fits using the known galactic value were generally poor .",
    "our derived fit to the extracted spectrum of the ulx using the diskbb model returns a value for @xmath39@xmath24 of approximately 2.0 kev , consistent with the interpretation provided by rp99 that this source is an xrb featuring a @xmath6 10 @xmath32@xmath33 mass black hole .",
    "all sources were investigated using a quantile color - color plot .",
    "time variability was investigated through comparisons of the fluxes between our _ chandra _ data and the rp99 results .",
    "three sources were shown to have varied by factors of @xmath66 to 30 or more .",
    "\\3 ) we searched for counterparts at multiple wavelengths for the detected x - ray sources .",
    "based on our search , we have identified counterparts to one snr , one hii region and two foreground stars ; the remaining sources are likely to be xrbs and luminous x - ray snrs native to ngc 7793 and background galaxies seen through the disk of the galaxy .",
    "the detected snr ",
    "n7793-s11  is also detected in the optical and radio , making it one of the few snrs located outside of the local group to be detected at all three wavelengths .",
    "we have also ruled out the possibility that the candidate radio snr r3 is a single snr .",
    "\\4 ) a remarkable asymmetry is seen in the distribution of x - ray sources in this galaxy , with the large majority seen in the eastern half .",
    "possible explanations for this asymmetry include a gravitational interaction with a nearby galaxy or stochastic star formation .",
    "\\5 ) the fitted temperature of the diffuse emission is @xmath8=0.253@xmath79 kev , lower than the temperature measured by rp99 .",
    "the discrepancy can be explained by the significant mixing of the diffuse emission with point source emission from the broad wings of the _ rosat _ pspc psf .",
    "\\6 ) we constructed the luminosity function for the detected discrete x - ray sources in ngc 7793 .",
    "if the known ulx in this galaxy is excluded , the absolute value of the fitted slope is @xmath9=@xmath100.65@xmath110.11 , but the shape is linear over a small range . if the ulx is included , the absolute value of the fitted slope becomes @xmath9=@xmath100.62@xmath110.2 but the residuals of the fit are much larger .",
