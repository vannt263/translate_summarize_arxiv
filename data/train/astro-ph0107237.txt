    "since gunn & gott ( 1972 ) have introduced the concept of ram pressure stripping , which can affect galaxies moving inside the intracluster medium ( icm ) of a galaxy cluster , this mechanism has been invoked to explain different observational phenomena as the hi deficiency of spiral galaxies in clusters ( chamaraux et al .",
    "1980 , bothun et al . 1982 ,",
    "giovanelli & haynes 1985 ) or the lower star formation activity of cluster spiral galaxies ( e.g. dressler et al . 1999 ,",
    "poggianti et al . 1999 ) .",
    "some other mechanisms have been proposed affecting spiral galaxies in clusters , among which :    * galaxy  galaxy interactions ( galaxy `` harassment '' ; moore et al . 1996 , 1998 ) * galaxy  cluster gravitational interaction ( byrd & valtonen 1990 , valluri 1993 )    all these kinds of interaction have in common that they can in principle remove the neutral gas from a galaxy inducing a decrease of its star formation activity .",
    "the strength of these interactions depends crucially on galaxy orbits .",
    "radial orbits allow galaxies to go deeper into the cluster potential where their velocity increases considerably and where the galaxy density and the density of the icm is substantially higher .",
    "dressler ( 1986 ) analyzed giovanelli & haynes ( 1985 ) data showing that hi deficient spiral galaxies are on radial orbits . numerical simulations",
    "( ghigna et al . 1998 ) showed that galaxy halos evolving within the cluster settle on isotropic orbits with a median ratio of pericentric to apocentric radii of 1:6 .",
    "the recent analysis of a spectroscopic catalog of galaxies in ten distant clusters ( dressler et al .",
    "1999 , poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) has shown that the galaxy populations of these clusters are characterized by the presence of a large number of post starburst galaxies .",
    "poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) concluded that the most evident effect due to the cluster environment is the quenching of star formation rather than its enhancement .",
    "they found two different galaxy evolution timescales in clusters .",
    "( i ) a rapid removal of the gas ( @xmath2 1 gyr ) .",
    "( ii ) a slow transformation of morphology ( several gyr ) .",
    "they stated that the mechanism responsible for the fast gas removal without changing the galaxy s morphology is very probably ram pressure stripping . furthermore , couch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , using _",
    "data , claimed that there are fewer disturbed galaxies than predicted by the galaxy harassment model .",
    "they suggested that ram pressure stripping by the hot icm truncates star formation .    in the local universe",
    ", the existence of a large number of post starburst galaxies in the coma cluster seems to indicate a triggering of the star formation activity by effects which are related to the cluster environment ( bothun & dressler 1986 , caldwell et al .",
    "caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) observed an enhanced number of post starburst galaxies within cluster environments . on the contrary , zabludoff et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that interactions with the cluster environment , in the form of the intracluster medium or cluster potential , are not essential for `` e+a '' formation .",
    "_ hst _ images of the coma starburst and post starburst galaxies ( caldwell , rose , & dendy 1999 ) revealed that star formation takes mainly place in the inner disk of these galaxies and is suppressed in the outer disk .",
    "if the starburst is related to the cluster environment , ram pressure stripping can naturally account for these characteristics .",
    "the best place to study the gas removal due to ram pressure is the virgo cluster as it is the closest cluster which can be observed in great detail .",
    "most of the spiral galaxies seem to have entered the cluster only recently ( within several gyr , tully & shaya 1984 ) .",
    "about half of them became hi deficient ( giovanelli & haynes 1985 ) .",
    "their hi disk sizes are considerably reduced ( van gorkom & kotanyi 1985 , warmels 1988 , cayatte et al . 1990 , 1994 ) .",
    "concerning the stellar content , their intrinsic color indices are not significantly different from field galaxies of the same morphological type ( gavazzi et al .",
    "1991 , gavazzi et al . 1998 ) . but",
    "despite the hi deficiency , cluster galaxies do not show a reduced co content ( kenney & young 1989 , boselli et al .",
    "1997 ) neither a reduced infrared luminosity ( bicay & giovanelli 1987 ) .",
    "this means that the neutral gas was removed without affecting the molecular component and without changing colors very much .",
    "the only interaction cited above producing this signature is ram pressure stripping .",
    "very few simulations have been done to quantify ram pressure stripping using eulerian hydrodynamic ( takeda , nulsen , & fabian 1984 , gaetz , salpeter & shaviv 1987 ; balsara , livio , & odea 1994 ) or sph codes ( tosa 1994 ; abadi , moore , & bower 1999 ) .",
    "we use a sticky particles model in which each particle represents a cloud complex with a given mass dependent radius .",
    "the viscosity of the clumpy ism is due to inelastic collisions between the particles .",
    "the effect of ram pressure is modeled as an additional acceleration on the particles located in the direction of the galaxy s motion .",
    "this article is devoted to the question if ram pressure stripping can account for the observed hi deficiency , hi distributions , and velocity fields of spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster . furthermore we investigate possible star formation mechanisms related to a ram pressure stripping event .",
    "we first discuss radial galactic orbits within the cluster gravitational potential ( section  2 ) .",
    "the model simulating the neutral gas content of an infalling galaxy is described in section  3 , followed by the detailed description of the simulations ( section  4 ) .",
    "the evolution of the stripped gas in the intracluster medium is investigated in section  5 . in section  6",
    "we give the results of these simulations and discuss them in section  7 .",
    "we confront observations of various quantities of spiral galaxies with the knowledge acquired with the help of the simulations ( section  8) and give possible explanations for their dynamical and physical state ( section  9 and 10 ) .",
    "the summary and conclusions are given in section  11 .",
    "we adopt a velocity of 1150 kms@xmath3 for the virgo cluster ( huchra 1988 ) and a distance of 17  mpc .",
    "the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) of density @xmath4 exerts a ram pressure : @xmath5 on a galaxy , which moves with a velocity @xmath6 through it . with decreasing distance to the cluster center the galaxy s velocity , the icm density , and",
    "thus ram pressure increase .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of ram pressure stripping depends strongly on the shape of the galaxy orbit within the cluster .",
    "radial orbits lead a galaxy deeper into the cluster core where ram pressure stripping is the most important .",
    "we investigate in this section the influence of the shape of radial orbits on the efficiency of ram pressure stripping .",
    "the gas in the galactic disk is removed if the ram pressure of the ism is greater than the restoring gravitational force per unit area provided by the galaxy s disk ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "the stripping radius @xmath7 can be estimated using the equation established by gunn & gott ( 1972 ) with @xmath8 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the stellar / gas surface density , @xmath4 is the icm density , @xmath11 is the rotation velocity , and @xmath6 is the galaxy s velocity within the cluster .",
    "we assume @xmath12  @xmath13 and @xmath14  kms@xmath15 .",
    "the minimum ram pressure @xmath16 to affect the atomic gas disk can be determined by setting @xmath17  kpc . for our model galaxy",
    "this leads to @xmath18  @xmath19(kms@xmath15)@xmath20 .",
    "[ fig : parameterspace ] shows the galaxy velocity as a function of the icm density for constant values of the ram pressure @xmath21 .",

    "the curves correspond to a values of @xmath23=1000 , 2000 , 5000 , 10000  @xmath19(kms@xmath15)@xmath20 that we used in our simulations . for the simulations we varied the inclination angle @xmath24 between the disk and the orbital plane : @xmath24=0@xmath25 , 20@xmath25 , 45@xmath25 , 90@xmath25 . with this definition of the inclination angle ,",
    "@xmath24=0@xmath25 means edge - on stripping and @xmath24=90@xmath25 face - on stripping . for our model , this represents the physically most meaningful definition and has the advantage that it leads to simple fitting functions of our numerical results .",
    "we took a @xmath26-model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) to describe the total mass density and the icm density : @xmath27 [ eq : betamodel ] where @xmath28 is the core radius , @xmath26 is the slope parameter , and @xmath29 is the central density .",
    "the values for the icm are : @xmath26=0.5 , @xmath28=13.4 kpc , and @xmath30 @xmath19 . for the total mass profile we used @xmath26=1 , @xmath28=0.32 mpc , and @xmath31 m@xmath1pc@xmath32 .",
    "this gives a total mass of @xmath33 m@xmath1 at a radius of 1 mpc ( schindler , bingelli , & bhringer 1999 ) .",
    "we have calculated orbits of test particles within the gravitational potential given by this mass distribution .",
    "the giant elliptical galaxy m86 has a total mass of about one tenth of the whole cluster mass ( schindler et al .",
    "the perturbation of the total gravitational field due to m86 is thus not negligible .",
    "we have added the gravitational potential corresponding to m86 ( @xmath26=0.5 , @xmath28=74.2 kpc , and @xmath34 m@xmath1pc@xmath32 ) .",
    "first , we have made test runs where we have put m86 on an elliptical orbit around m87 .",
    "the results for the orbiting perturber ( m86 ) are that ( i ) m87 begins also to move and ( ii ) the additional mass distribution perturbs the trajectories of the test galaxy producing a wide variety of radial orbits with different impact parameters . without the perturbing gravitational potential",
    "the orbits would lie in one single plane and the impact parameter , i.e. the closest approach to the cluster center , would stay constant .",
    "second , we have fixed m86 in space . in this case",
    "the galaxy orbits are perturbed in the same way as in the previous case .",
    "we can thus conclude that in both cases the presence of m86 near m87 changes significantly the trajectories of galaxies on radial orbits . for simplicity we have chosen to fix m86 in space .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] shows the orbits calculated with the fixed gravitational potential of m87 and m86 .",
    "the asymmetric gravitational potential leads to a variation of the impact parameter and the maximum velocity for each orbit .",
    "the initial conditions were fixed such that the resulting maximum ram pressure varies between 1000 and 5000  @xmath19(kms@xmath15)@xmath20 . if a spiral galaxy is gravitationally bound to the cluster , these high eccentricities are needed in order to obtain the highest ram pressure maxima . however , for values of the maximum ram pressure smaller than @xmath23000  @xmath19(kms@xmath15)@xmath20 slightly less eccentric orbits are also possible .",
    "the smallest impact parameter , i.e. the closest approach to the cluster center , is @xmath290  kpc with a maximum velocity of 2200  kms@xmath15 .",
    "a small change of the initial conditions , resulting in an impact parameter of @xmath270  kpc , leads to a maximum ram pressure of 10000  @xmath19(kms@xmath15)@xmath20 .",
    "given the uncertainties of the determination of the enclosed mass and the icm density profile , we think that this extreme orbit is still realistic for the virgo cluster .",
    "the largest impact parameter is @xmath2200  kpc .",
    "the timescale between two passages through the cluster core is about 10@xmath35  yr .",
    "a galaxy will therefore have at most a few passages during its lifetime within the cluster .",
    "thus the simulation does not trace the trajectory of one single galaxy but creates a variety of orbits corresponding to different initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , it is not excluded that a galaxy can have two passages through the cluster core .",
    "we define the normalized ram pressure as @xmath36 where @xmath29=10@xmath37 @xmath19 and @xmath38=1000 kms@xmath15 are representative averaged values . the resulting normalized ram pressure of the orbits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : normrampress ] .",
    "this graph illustrates that the perturbation of the galaxy orbits by m86 can result in a change of the ram pressure strength up to 50% because of the small core radius of the icm distribution . a small change of the impact parameter leads to a considerable change of the icm density , whereas for values of the impact parameters between 100 and 200  kpc the change of the maximum galaxy velocities is only of the order of @xmath210% .",
    "for these radial orbits ram pressure dominates the thermal pressure of the icm ( @xmath39 k ) for distances less than one abell radius ( @xmath40  mpc ) as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pram_picm ] .    in order to compare these orbits directly with observations , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits_vz ] the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity with respect to the cluster mean velocity as a function of the projected distance to the cluster center ( m87 ) .",
    "the number of orbits is sufficient to be representative for radial orbits over the whole volume of the virgo cluster .",
    "the region above the envelope of these curves corresponds to more circular orbits .",
    "this diagram will be used later on to compare the model orbits directly with observations .",
    "we can now address the question if we can constrain the orbital shape of hi deficient galaxies .",
    "as stated above , a minimum ram pressure of @xmath41  @xmath19(kms@xmath15)@xmath20 is necessary in order to affect the atomic gas disk . in the case of circular orbits the galaxy velocity has the keplerian value @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the gravitational potential of the cluster .",
    "this means that in the virgo cluster a galaxy with a rotation velocity of @xmath44  kms@xmath15 , which is on a circular orbit , must be closer than 250  kpc ( 50@xmath45 ) to the cluster center in order to be affected significantly by ram pressure .",
    "if spiral galaxies have been accreted only recently , it is not probable that they are on circular orbits with a such small distance to the cluster center . on",
    "the observational side , hoffman , helou , & salpeter ( 1988 ) found a few hi rich dwarf galaxies within a radius of 5@xmath25 around m87 .",
    "these galaxies are much more vulnerable to ram pressure stripping , because of their lower gravitational potential .",
    "at least some of these dwarfs must evolve on circular orbits with radii smaller than 1  mpc , where they have never been stripped by ram pressure .    in the case of highly eccentric orbits ,",
    "the maximum orbital velocity is given by the escape velocity @xmath46 .",
    "the impact parameter must be smaller than 400  kpc ( 1.3@xmath25 ) in order to obtain @xmath47  @xmath19(kms@xmath15)@xmath20 . for more massive galaxies",
    "( @xmath48  kms@xmath15 ) the maximum impact parameter is still smaller .",

    "there are different ways to model the interstellar gas numerically : ( i ) hydrodynamical , ( ii ) sph , and ( iii ) sticky particle models .",
    "each class has its advantages and limits .",
    "since the ism is neither a continuous medium ( hydrodynamics , sph ) nor exclusively made of clouds ( sticky particles ) , one has to chose the class which is well adapted for the investigated astrophysical problem . in the following we will motivate the choice of our model .    the interstellar hi gas is a clumpy medium ( see e.g. kim et al .",
    "1998 for the lmc ) . in the galaxy",
    "roughly half of the interstellar hi is in the warm phase ( @xmath51  k ) with a volume filling factor of @xmath20.5 .",
    "the other half is in the form of cold ( @xmath5280  k ) and dense clouds with a filling factor of @xmath20.01 ( kulkarni & heiles 1988 ) .",
    "if they are in pressure equilibrium with the rest of the ism at @xmath53  k@xmath19 , they have a density of @xmath5440  @xmath19 .",
    "the largest clouds have column densities of @xmath55  @xmath13 . on the largest scale ,",
    "three dimensional structures of the atomic gas phase are major hi concentrations around dark clouds and newly formed stars .",
    "they have column densities of @xmath56  @xmath19 and masses of @xmath57  m@xmath1 ( kulkarni & heiles 1988 ) .",
    "thus , the cold atomic phase of the ism is well represented by discrete particles . concerning the warm neutral phase , murakami & babul ( 1999 ) have shown in their hydrodynamical simulations of the effects of ram pressure on an elliptical galaxy that the continuous ism tends to be stripped in the form of distinct clouds if they included the external icm pressure .",
    "these clouds have densities @xmath58  @xmath19 and radii @xmath59  pc , resulting in a column density of @xmath56  @xmath19 .",
    "we therefore think that the warm neutral phase , which is subjected to an external pressure due to the surrounding icm and to ram pressure forces , can also be modeled by distinct particles .",
    "these considerations motivate our approach to model the entire atomic phase of the ism as sticky particles where each particle represents a gas cloud complex .",
    "we assume that the clouds have a constant column density .",
    "the relevant physical property of the ism with respect to ram pressure is the column density of the gas / clouds .",
    "it is adapted to observed values .",
    "the effect of ram pressure is simulated as an additional acceleration applied on the clouds which are exposed to the icm in the direction of the galaxy s motion within the cluster .      since we do not want to include gravitational interactions , we let the gas clouds evolve in a given analytical gravitational potential .",

    "this value is consistent with the measurements made by rots et al .",
    "( 1990 ) on nearby galaxies .",

    "their timescale for ram pressure stripping is between 1 and 5@xmath275  yr , thus comparable to our simulations . in difference to our model they have used a decreasing gas surface density profile @xmath276 that corresponds to the total gas surface density ( atomic and molecular ) .",
    "they therefore underestimated the final hi deficiency .",
    "this becomes clear if one estimates the hi deficiency using their hi to optical radius fraction and fig .",

    "it is worth noting that we can reproduce the hi observations using only one passage of the galaxy near the cluster center . as a typical orbital period of an hi deficient spiral galaxy",
    "is of the order of several gyr , it is possible that it has already passed through the cluster center more than once .",
    "the galaxy trajectory model has shown that the existence of a perturbing gravitational potential ( m86 ) in the cluster center has two effects : ( i ) it can make the central mass concentration ( m87 ) move . as the intracluster gas will follow the variable gravitational potential , the location of highest gas density within the cluster can also change .",
    "( ii ) the galaxy orbits will change leading to a ram pressure profile changing with time for each passage in the cluster center .",
    "our simulations indicate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cayatte94 ] ) that the lower hi surface densities of galaxies with @xmath280 is due to internal parameters of the galaxy ( section  [ subsec : comparison ] ) which lower the hi to h@xmath147 ratio within the optical disk , whereas the total gas surface density stays the same .",
    "furthermore , the simulations of valluri ( 1993 ) indicate that the gravitational potential of the galaxy does not change significantly when the galaxy passes near the cluster center . for the estimation of the final hi deficiency after a stripping event",
    ", the stellar and gas surface densities can thus be regarded as constant in a first approximation .",
    "a galaxy with an already truncated hi radius with an unchanged total gas surface density will only lose more gas in a further stripping event if the maximum ram pressure and/or its inclination angle with respect to the orbital plane is higher than before .",
    "if a galaxy has already accomplished several orbits within the cluster , the orbit leading to the closest approach to the cluster center and/or having the highest inclination angle @xmath24 is decisive for its hi deficiency . on the other hand ,",
    "if the final surface density is decreased , a further passage through the cluster core will result in a higher hi deficiency .",
    "the observed population of deficient galaxies represents galaxies which have passed through the cluster center at least once .",
    "the different groups of cayatte et al . ( 1994 ) represent galaxies on different orbits in the cluster .",
    "the fact that we can assign galaxies in the final state after the interaction to these groups confirms the conclusion that all hi deficient galaxies have already passed through the cluster center .",
    "the effects of ram pressure can be observed before the closest passage of the galaxy to the cluster center only in the case of inclination angles @xmath281 .",
    "the observed asymmetries of the gas distribution of hi deficient ( @xmath230 ) in the virgo cluster which are located more than 1@xmath25 from the cluster center are due to a former ism ",

    "the most important consequence of ram pressure stripping on cluster spiral galaxies is the removal of a large fraction of their gas reservoir . without the supply of fresh gas ,",
    "the star formation activity of a stripped galaxy will decrease on the timescale of a cluster crossing time .",
    "nevertheless , the interaction of the galaxy s gas with the icm can lead to a short enhancement of its star formation activity . in this section",

    "* a considerable fraction of the initial galaxy s gas mass can be accreted back on the galaxy in the case of low ram pressure maxima and low inclination angles ( up to 10% ) .",

    "if we relate the enhancement of the gas surface density to a local star formation rate via the schmidt law ( schmidt 1959 , kennicutt 1983 ) and via star formation due to colliding flows ( see e.g. hunter et al . 1986 ) , these results lead to two possibilities of an enhancement of star formation :    \\(i ) an instantaneous burst in the inner galactic disk which happens before ( @xmath298 yr ) or while the galaxy passes through the cluster center . for the virgo cluster",
    "this happens within a radius of @xmath299 around the cluster center .",

    "we conclude that ram pressure stripping can induce two types of star formation activity : a short burst during its passage in the cluster center or a longer lived more continuous star formation activity due to the re - accretion of the stripped gas .",
    "the strength of the star formation activity is governed by the galactic orbits in the cluster .",
    "this confirms the suggestion of bothun & dressler ( 1986 ) that ram pressure causes the hi deficiency and can induce star formation .",
    "several individual cases will be discussed in forthcoming papers .",
    "with the acquired knowledge of the previous section we can now study the link between the properties of virgo cluster spiral galaxies and their orbits .",

    "these galaxies have already passed through the cluster center at least once . for most of the group i and ii galaxies , which have entered the cluster a few crossing times ago , the passage with the smallest impact parameter was decisive for their hi deficiency .",

    "they interpreted this result as indicative for a gravitational field , which is strongly perturbed by ongoing mergers of major subclumps .    in order to investigate the link between hi deficiency and galaxy orbits , we use position  velocity plots of different galaxy populations in the virgo cluster together with our model orbits .      we show the hi deficiency data collected by guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange ( 1986 ) in a radial velocity  projected distance plot ( fig .  [",

    "the curves of the model orbits ( section  [ sec : orbits ] ) are plotted as dotted lines , the keplerian and escape velocity for the gravitational potential of m87 as solid and dashed lines .",
    "the model orbits cover about half of the total area in the radial velocity  projected distance plane .",
    "the size of the crosses is proportional to the hi deficiency .",
    "we only plot galaxies with @xmath306 .",
    "9 out of 41 hi deficient galaxies ( @xmath307% ) lie beyond the model orbits marked by the dotted lines for a maximum projected distance of 12@xmath25 ( ngc  4193 , ngc  4212 , ngc  4216 , ngc  4235 , ngc  4260 , ngc  4419 , ngc  4450 , ngc  4522 , ngc  4826 ) .",
    "the range of the projected distance of these galaxies is between 2@xmath25 and 7@xmath25 .",
    "solanes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) did not find a decrease of the velocity dispersion for distances smaller than 5@xmath25 because of these high velocity hi deficient galaxies .",
    "their velocities are even higher than the keplerian velocity due to the m87 gravitational potential but still below the escape velocity .",
    "thus it is likely that they evolve on bound orbits .",
    "we will discuss this issue in section  [ sec : infall ] . for larger radii",
    "we find a trend that hi deficient galaxies evolve on radial orbits as already pointed out by dressler ( 1986 ) and giraud ( 1986 ) .",
    "anemic galaxies are a special class of galaxies with a very low arm inter - arm contrast ( van den bergh 1976 ) .",
    "they are most similar to the passive spirals observed in high redshift clusters ( see e.g. poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) and are believed to represent the oldest spiral galaxy population which has entered the cluster several gyr ago .",
    "we suggest the following evolutionary scenario for these galaxies : after a major stripping event the galaxy has lost its gas in the outer disk .",
    "the ongoing star formation activity exhausted its remaining gas reservoir in its entire disk . without the possibility of a supply of fresh gas from the outer disk , star formation activity in the spiral arm decreased which led to a decreasing arm inter - arm contrast , i.e. the galaxy became anemic .",
    "thus , an anemic galaxy has entered the cluster more than one crossing time ago on a radial orbit . in order to investigate",
    "if anemic galaxies are still on radial orbits or if tidal interactions have lead to more circular orbits , we show the distribution of this population in the radial velocity  projected distance plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : anemic ] .",
    "we include here also the group iv galaxies of cayatte et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , because we assume that the reduced hi diameter regardless of a central hole is due to the major stripping event .",
    "the small number of orbits prevents us from a quantitative tracing of the dispersion velocity as a function of the projected distance .",
    "nevertheless , we observe that 12 out of 15 anemic galaxies lie on radial orbits except ( ngc  4192 , ngc  4450 , and ngc  4419 ) .",
    "ngc  4192 is seen nearly edge - on .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to estimate its arm inter - arm contrast .",
    "the low hi deficiency of ngc  4192 indicates that this galaxy might be misclassified as an anemic galaxy .",
    "if we exclude this galaxy , there is an indication that the velocity dispersion decreases with increasing distance .",
    "this is consistent with anemic galaxies being preferentially on radial orbits .",
    "as they represent a spiral population which entered the cluster more than several gyr ago , there is an indication that their orbits were not perturbed by the changing gravitational field due to the merging of subclumps .",
    "if this tendency turns out to be real , this would mean that only the infalling galaxies are scattered with high velocities to large distances from the cluster center during the merging of a major subclump ( e.g. m86 ) and not the old spiral population .",
    "interestingly , solanes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that the velocity dispersion of early type spiral galaxies does not decrease .",
    "anemic galaxies might thus form a special class of galaxies whose orbits are of different shape than those of early type spirals .",
    "we will now try to explain the existence of the group of high velocity hi deficient galaxies which can be found at projected distances of @xmath308 ( ngc  4193 , ngc  4212 , ngc  4216 , ngc  4235 , ngc  4260 , ngc  4419 , ngc  4450 , ngc  4522 ) .",
    "one of its members ( ngc 4522 ) has been observed in h@xmath200 by kenney & koopmann ( 1999 ) .",
    "they claim that there are extraplanar ionized filaments and identify it as one of the best candidates for ram pressure stripping . as we have shown before",
    ", spiral galaxies on radial orbits which lead to a strong stripping event do not permit these positions in the radial velocity - projected distance plot .",
    "thus , there must be another explanation .",
    "the basic idea comes from the presence of m86 in the vicinity of m87 . since it has a high radial velocity with respect to m87 , it is probable that m86 is falling into the cluster from behind .",
    "in addition , the central dwarf population shows already a spatial distortion in the direction of m86 ( schindler et al .",
    "we interpret this as the consequence of the passage of m86 near the cluster center , i.e. m87 . if the subclump of m86 has entered the virgo cluster with its own spiral galaxy population , these could have been captured by the virgo cluster .",
    "the outcoming orbits of this infalling spiral population can be very different from those which are already settled .",
    "we have tested this hypothesis with the help of our orbit simulations .",
    "m87 has been placed at rest in the center .",
    "m86 is located at ( 0.5 mpc , 0 mpc , 5 mpc ) and with an initial velocity vector ( 0 kms@xmath15 , 1 kms@xmath15 , 0 kms@xmath15 ) . for the test galaxy we adopted : @xmath309 = ( 0.5 mpc , 1 mpc , 5 mpc ) and @xmath310 ( 258 kms@xmath15 , 1 kms@xmath15 , 258 kms@xmath15 ) , i.e. the test galaxy is orbiting at a distance of 1 mpc around m86 which is falling radially ( along the los ) into the gravitational potential of m87 .",
    "we have included the full symmetric gravitational potential of both galaxies .",
    "the effects of an internal perturbation of m86 due to the tidal interaction with m87 is neglected .",
    "the assumption is justified , because the difference between their radial velocities @xmath311  kms@xmath15 is much larger than the dispersion velocity of m86 .",
    "the resulting trajectories can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : infall_yz ] .",
    "when the m86 clump approaches m87 the latter also begins to move .",
    "the test galaxy is orbiting in the joint gravitational potential of m87 and m86 following m86 in the @xmath76-direction .",
    "when passing near m87 it can even be ejected from the cluster as it happens at the end of our simulation .",
    "the corresponding radial velocity - projected distance plot can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : infall_velocity ] .",
    "the positions and velocities are plotted with respect to the positions and velocities of m87 , the center of the virgo cluster .",
    "clearly there is the possibility to obtain high radial velocities at large projected distances especially when the galaxy is ejected from the cluster .",
    "there is also the effect that m87 begins to move , changing the position of the cluster center .",
    "we suggest that the existence of the special galaxy population with high radial velocities at large projected distances is linked to the trajectory of m86 perturbing the gravitational potential . in this scenario",
    "these galaxies pass the cluster center with high velocities .",
    "the increased velocity leads to an enhanced ram pressure ( @xmath312 ) .",
    "solanes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also suggested that gravitational perturbations due to major subclumps ( as m86 ) are responsible for the high velocities hi deficient galaxies .",
    "if these galaxies are bound , they will evolve on extremely eccentric orbits with very long periods .",
    "after the merging of the subclump , they will be most probably found at very large distances from the cluster center and the velocity dispersion of the remaining hi deficient galaxies will again decrease .    since there are indications that galaxies are accreted in subclumps , the accretion rate is expected to be highly irregular showing strong peaks when a subclump as m86 is falling into the cluster adding new spiral galaxies to the existing population .",
    "accreted spiral galaxies are preferentially on radial orbits which lead them near the cluster center where ram pressure is most efficient .",
    "very recently accreted galaxies ( @xmath21 gyr ) can have an enhanced star formation rate in the outer disk due to the re - accretion of stripped gas . during the ram pressure stripping event ,",
    "the atomic gas is stripped from the outer disk leaving the molecular gas unaffected .",
    "consequently the star formation activity in the outer disk region of highly stripped galaxies decreases , whereas the star formation rate in the inner disk stays roughly constant after a possible short increase ( see section  [ sec : starform ] ) .",
    "this leads to a decrease of the overall star formation rate .",
    "koopmann & kenney ( 1998 ) noticed that the morphological classification of the spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster taking only into account the overall star formation rate is often ambiguous .",
    "galaxies classified in this way as early type spirals become late types if one takes into account their disk to bulge ratios in the r band .",
    "these galaxies show a reduced overall star formation rate , which is mainly due to a strongly reduced star formation rate in the outer disk .",
    "we suggest that this special type of galaxies has undergone a ram pressure stripping event",

    "this corresponds to roughly 10% of the total molecular gas content in both cases .",
    "thus , the occurrence of a central star burst can additionally lower the global star formation rate by @xmath210% after a strong stripping event .",
    "if the gas content within an optical radius of a non deficient galaxy is dominated by the atomic phase , ram pressure stripping can account for the quenching of star formation at a timescale of @xmath21 gyr described by poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in the case of a strong edge - on stripping event",

    "this transformation might be due to the combined effect of high speed encounters with massive galaxies and the interaction with the gravitational potential of the cluster ( `` galaxy harassment '' ; moore et al .",

    "we give an approximation of the relation between the hi deficiency on the one hand and the maximum ram pressure and inclination angle on the other hand .",

    "<S> we investigate the role of ram pressure stripping in the virgo cluster using n - body simulations . </S>",
    "<S> radial orbits within the virgo cluster s gravitational potential are modeled and analyzed with respect to ram pressure stripping . </S>",
    "<S> the n - body model consists of 10000 gas cloud complexes which can have inelastic collisions . </S>",
    "<S> ram pressure is modeled as an additional acceleration on the clouds located at the surface of the gas distribution in the direction of the galaxy s motion within the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we made several simulations changing the orbital parameters in order to recover different stripping scenarios using realistic temporal ram pressure profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate systematically the influence of the inclination angle between the disk and the orbital plane of the galaxy on the gas dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we show that ram pressure can lead to a temporary increase of the central gas surface density . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> a considerable part of the total atomic gas mass ( several @xmath0  m@xmath1 ) can fall back onto the galactic disk after the stripping event . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative relation between the orbit parameters and the resulting hi deficiency is derived containing explicitly the inclination angle between the disk and the orbital plane . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between existing hi observations and the results of our simulations shows that the hi deficiency depends strongly on galaxy orbits . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that the scenario where ram pressure stripping is responsible for the observed hi deficiency is consistent with all hi 21 cm observations in the virgo cluster . </S>"
