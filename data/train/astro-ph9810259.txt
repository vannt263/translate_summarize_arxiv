    "this paper is the second in a series investigating the evolved - star populations in nearby globular clusters . with the large - field ccd",
    "imagers now available it is possible to measure nearly complete samples of giant stars in clusters , and at the same time measure stars faint enough that we can normalize the luminosity functions ( lfs ) to the unevolved main sequence . because the lfs for evolved stars directly probe the timescales and fuel consumed in the different phases of stellar evolution , they provide a stringent test of the models for the evolution of low - mass stars .",
    "these models are the basis for our use of globular clusters to set a lower limit to the age of the universe and are a fundamental tool in the interpretation of the integrated spectra and colors of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the subject of this study is m30 ( ngc 7099 = c2137 - 174 ) , a relatively nearby cluster ( @xmath8 kpc ; peterson 1993 ) at high galactic latitude ( @xmath9 = @xmath10468 ) .",
    "m30 has a high central density ( @xmath11 ) , a moderate total mass ( @xmath12 ; pryor & meylan 1993 ) , and is at the metal - poor end of the cluster [ fe / h ] distribution .",
    "it is one of approximately 10% of clusters that have cusps at the core of their surface brightness profiles , and it also has one of the largest radial color gradients of any cluster ( stetson 1991b ) .",
    "previous studies of the lf for stars in metal - poor clusters have uncovered unexpected features . in a lf formed from the combination of ccd - based observations of the clusters m68 ( ngc 4590 = c1236 - 264 ) , ngc 6397 ( c1736 - 536 ) , and m92 ( ngc 6341 = c1715 + 432 ) , stetson ( 1991a ) found an excess of stars on the subgiant branch ( sgb ) just above the main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) .",
    "bolte ( 1994 ) and bergbusch ( 1996 ) both observed m30 using a mosaic of small - field ccd images and found an excess of sgb stars .",
    "( the sgb is defined here as the transitional region between the main - sequence turnoff and the base of the red giant branch at the point of maximum curvature . )",
    "another unexpected observation involving lfs is a mismatch between theoretical predictions and the observed size of the `` jump '' dividing the main sequence ( ms ) and the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "when normalized to the ms , there is an excess of observed rgb stars compared to models ( stetson 1991a , bergbusch & vandenberg 1992 , bolte 1994 , bergbusch 1996 ) , although this has been disputed by deglinnocenti , weiss , & leone ( 1997 ) .",
    "these results might be explained by the action of core rotation ( vandenberg , larson , & depropris 1998 ) , or perhaps ( as discussed later ) we are witnessing the results of deep mixing and the delivery of fresh fuel into the hydrogen shell - burning regions .",
    "langer & hoffman ( 1995 ) suggested that , if the abundance patterns of light elements seen in bright cluster giants ( e.g. kraft 1994 ) are due to deep mixing , hydrogen - rich envelope material is almost certainly mixed into the hydrogen burning shell ( prolonging the giant phase of evolution ) , and some of the helium produced is returned to the envelope . because of the potential importance of such non - standard physics in stars , and because of the caveats associated with earlier lf studies , the most productive next step is to derive better lfs in a number of galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) .    in the next section",
    ", we describe our observations of the cluster . in  3 , we discuss the features observed in the color - magnitude diagram , describe the method of computing the luminosity functions , and present the results of artificial star experiments . in  4 , we discuss the constraints that can be put on the global parameters of the cluster  metallicity , distance , and age .",
    "the method of data reduction is described in appendix a.",
    "the data used in deriving the @xmath13- and @xmath14-band lfs of m30 were taken on july 7/8 , 1994 at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 4 m telescope . in all , six exposures of 120 s , one exposure of 60 s and two exposures of 10 s were made in @xmath13 , and six exposures of 120 s , one exposure of 60 s , and one exposure of 10 s were made in @xmath14 .",
    "all frames were taken using the 2048 @xmath15 2048",
    "pixel `` tek # 4 '' ccd chip , which has a sampling of about 044 per pixel , and a field 15@xmath16 on a side .",
    "these exposures were reduced individually for the purpose of constructing the color - magnitude diagram . in performing artificial star experiments and deriving the lf ,",
    "the three best - seeing images in both @xmath13- and @xmath14-bands were combined into master long - exposure images .",
    "the frames were centered approximately 2@xmath16 east of the cluster center , in order to avoid a bright field star nearby .",
    "the night of the 4 m observations was not photometric . in order to set the observations on a standard photometric system",
    ", we used observations made at the ctio 1.5  m telescope on one photometric night ( october 18/19 , 1996 ) .",
    "the detector used was the `` tek # 5 '' 2048 @xmath15 2048 ccd , having a field of about 148 on a side .",
    "landolt ( 1992 ) standard star observations were used to calibrate a secondary field that overlapped the 4 m field . on that night , 10  s and 120  s exposures were taken in each band , along with exposures of 27 standards in 7 landolt fields .",
    "a sample of 118 stars having @xmath17 and @xmath18 was calibrated as secondary standards in this way .",
    "the field was centered approximately @xmath19 south of the cluster center .    during the same run on the 1.5  m telescope ,",
    "frames were taken of m30 on the non - photometric night of october 16/17 .",
    "five additional exposures were taken in each band ( 20 s , 200s , and 3@xmath15600s in v , and 15 s , 180 s , and 3@xmath15600s in @xmath14 ) .",
    "the details of the data reduction and calibration are described in appendix a.",
    "in figure  [ m30cmd ] , we plot the total @xmath0 sample of 25279 stars ( upper panel ) and a sample that has been restricted in projected radius to @xmath20 from the cluster center ( lower panel ) .",
    "the inner radius was chosen in accord with the restriction placed on stars to be used later in the lfs , while the outer radius restriction was chosen to exclude regions that were affected by field star contamination .",
    "fiducial points for the ms and lower rgb of the clusters were determined by finding the mode of the color distribution of the points in magnitude bins .",
    "the fiducial line on the upper rgb was determined by finding the mean color of the stars in magnitude bins . once a mean was determined ,",
    "stars falling more than @xmath21 from the fiducial point were discarded ( so as to eliminate agb and hb stars , as well as blends and poorly measured stars ) , and the mean redetermined .",
    "this procedure was iterated until the star list did not change between iterations . at the tip of the rgb and on the agb",
    ", the positions of individual stars were included as fiducial points if they appeared to be continuations of the mean fiducial line .",
    "the fiducial line for the hb was obtained by determining mean points in magnitude bins for the blue tail , and in color bins for the horizontal part of the branch .",
    "no smoothing has been applied .",
    "table  [ fidtab ] lists the fiducial lines for our samples , as well as the number of stars used in computing each point .",
    "the procedure used to correct the `` observed '' lf back to the `` true '' lf is described in detail in sandquist et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . as in that paper",
    ", we carried out artificial star tests on only four frames : a long exposure frame ( composed of the average of the three best - seeing images ) and a short exposure frame in both @xmath13 and @xmath14 band . in 11 runs ,",
    "20965 artificial stars were processed .",
    "allframe s coordinate transformations were found to be unable to follow the nonuniform spatial distortions introduced by the 4  m field corrector . to avoid this problem , we reduced all of the frames through allstar as usual , derived a master detected star list for each filter , and rereduced the frames in allstar with the improved positions .",
    "this procedure improved the overall quality of the photometry ( as judged by the scatter around the fiducial lines of the cluster ) , as allframe normally does .    in figures  [ delta ]  [ fsfig ] we plot our computed values for median magnitude biases @xmath22 , median external error @xmath23 , and completeness probability @xmath24 as a function of magnitude and radius .",
    "there is little variation in most of the quantities until the innermost radial region ( @xmath25 20 , where crowding of stellar images is worst ) is reached .",
    "one change we have made since our first study was in the error estimation . the uncertainty in the incompleteness factor @xmath26 was previously found by simultaneously varying @xmath27 , and @xmath28 in such a way as to cause the maximum change in @xmath26 away from our best value .",
    "the magnitude of this change was used as the error estimate .",
    "we have improved this , following a suggestion by bergbusch ( 1996 ) , by estimating the error by varying @xmath29 and @xmath28 individually and adding the resulting error estimates in quadrature .    using this information , we eliminated stars from consideration for the lf if they fell far enough away from the nearest point on the fiducial line of the cluster .",
    "the `` distance '' was defined in terms of difference in magnitude and color divided by their respective external errors , and then added in quadrature .",
    "so , stars were eliminated if @xmath30 . on the upper rgb , where contamination by the agb could be a factor , we adjusted the error cutoff by hand until we were sure the agb stars were being eliminated , but not at the expense of the rgb stars .",
    "the luminosity functions are listed in tables  [ vlftab ] and [ ilftab ] .",
    "totals of 14772 and 14507 stars were used in creating the @xmath13- and @xmath14-band lfs .",
    "stars on the ms and sgb were only included if they fell more than 20 from the center of the cluster .",
    "this reduced the significance of crowding effects on the photometry .",
    "stars with magnitudes @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) were included in the determination of the lf to within @xmath33 of the center of the cluster .",
    "this was done to get a better indication of the `` global '' lf for the red giants since mass segregation is expected to occur in m30 , which would affect the rgb star counts taken from a small range of radii .",
    "most previous studies have made estimates of e(@xmath34 ) .",
    "we will assume e@xmath35 ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) for the rest of the discussion and refer to the reddening in e@xmath36 .",
    "m30 is situated well out of the galactic plane ( @xmath37 ) and the reddening is likely small ( e@xmath38 ) .",
    "reddening maps of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) indicate that e@xmath39 .",
    "reed , hesser & shawl ( 1988 ) derive a _ negative _ reddening based on the comparison of m30 s integrated color and spectral type .",
    "zinn ( 1980 ) gets a value of 0.01 from integrated - light measurements .",
    "reed , hesser , & shawl s data indicates that m30 appears to have the bluest intrinsic colors of all of the globular clusters they examined .",
    "however , m30 is the cluster that shows the strongest color gradient of any ggc and reddening values measured from integrated colors or spectra will depend on the range of radii over which the observations are made . given the sense of the gradient , bluer towards the center , it seems likely that these reddening measurements will be biased to lower values .",
    "dickens ( 1972 ) and richer , fahlman , & vandenberg ( 1988 ; hereafter rfv ) independently derived significantly higher values , e(@xmath40 , based on the ubv colors of blue hb stars in m30 . on the other hand , @xmath41-band photometry is notoriously difficult to calibrate and the precision of reddening estimates from color - color plots is @xmath42 mag even in the best cases .",
    "neither the dickens nor the rfv study appears to have had a photometric calibration good enough to warrant error bars less than this .",
    "differential cmd comparisons with m92 ( vandenberg , bolte , & stetson 1990 ; hereafter vbs ) and m68 ( figure  [ m30vsm68 ] ) imply e@xmath43 to 0.06 .",
    "the recent reddening maps based on iras and cobe measurements of far - ir flux from infrared cirrus suggest e(@xmath44 .",
    "we can make our own estimate using using sarajedini s ( 1994 ) simultaneous reddening and metallicity method ( for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where the quoted errors allow some room for calibration errors ) .",
    "we find e@xmath47 .",
    "the errors were derived from monte carlo tests with the quoted errors on @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "most of the reddening estimates we have thus far indicate a relatively high value e@xmath50 .",
    "the compilation of zinn & west ( 1984 ) has [ fe / h ] @xmath51 and numerous studies since have determined values between @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( geisler , minniti , & clari 1992 ; minniti et al .",
    "1993 ; carretta & gratton 1996 ) . from the simultaneous reddening and metallicity method",
    "above , we find [ fe / h]@xmath54 .",
    "anticipating later discussion of the level of the hb , we examine the effects of an anomalously high on the simultaneous reddening and metallicity method .",
    "a high value can come about due to a high helium abundance , whether primordial or the result of a `` deep mixing '' scenario ( langer & hoffman 1995 ) .",
    "if the `` true '' value ( in the absence of helium enrichment ) is fainter by 0.10 mag , then we would have @xmath55 , and calculate [ fe / h ] @xmath56 and e@xmath57 .",
    "recently reid ( 1997 ) , gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and pont et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have used subdwarf parallaxes measured with the _ hipparcos _ satellite ( esa 1997 ) to redetermine the distance moduli to several of the best observed clusters .",
    "the general result of these studies is to increase cluster distance moduli by 0.2 to 0.4 mag , implying high luminosities for the horizontal branches ( as bright as m@xmath58 mag for the [ fe / h]@xmath59 clusters ) . for m30 specifically , gratton et al . find ( m - m)@xmath60 ( for e@xmath61 ) although this is based on only three subdwarfs .",
    "we repeat this exercise for m30 with our data and a larger set of subdwarfs .",
    "this method is sensitive to uncertainties in the color of the unevolved main - sequence , which result from zero - point errors in the photometric calibration , the reddening uncertainties already mentioned , and uncertainties in the placement of the main - sequence fiducial line .",
    "our data for m30 are not optimum for using subdwarf fitting to measure the distance , primarily because of the uncertainty in the reddening , but also because we suffer from each of the other problems to a small degree .    nevertheless , we selected subdwarfs that satisfy the following criteria : parallaxes from the _ hipparcos _ mission having relative errors @xmath62 , metal abundances from the study of gratton , carretta , & castelli ( 1996 ) , and @xmath0 photometry . the restriction on parallax error",
    "was chosen to minimize the effect of bias corrections .",
    "( as a result , lutz - kelker corrections only change our derived distance moduli by 0.01 mag . )",
    "the gratton et al .",
    "metallicity scale was chosen for its homogeneity and because it minimizes the possibility of systematic abundance errors with respect to carretta & gratton globular cluster metallicities .",
    "when available , we used @xmath0 photometry for the subdwarfs tabulated in mandushev et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in the remaining cases",
    ", we followed their procedure of combining literature values from the following sources : carney & aaronson ( 1979 ) , carney ( 1980 , 1983b ) , and ryan ( 1989 , 1992 ) .",
    "the studies involving carney all used the johnson @xmath14 filter , so we applied the transformation from carney ( 1983a ) to convert them to the cousins system .",
    "known spectroscopic binaries were excluded , and , for the cases where it has been measured , any reddening of the subdwarfs ( at most a very small amount ) has been subtracted .",
    "our sample of subdwarfs and metal - poor subgiants is shown in table  [ subdtab ] .",
    "we used the subdwarfs to estimate the distance to m30 in two different ways .",
    "first , to simultaneously estimate the distance and e@xmath36 of m30 we created a grid of chi - square - like sums .",
    "the m30 main sequence between @xmath63 was represented by a third - order polynomial . for ranges of m - m and e@xmath64 ) , the minimum distance of each subdwarf from the main - sequence polynomial was calculated .",
    "this distance was normalized by the combined errors in the subdwarfs colors and magnitudes and the main - sequence fiducial uncertainties in color and magnitude ( assumed to be 0.04 mag in color and 0.05 mag in @xmath13 magnitude ) .",
    "our `` @xmath65 '' sum is :    @xmath66    we will refer to this as the chi - square sum although it does not match the usual definition of chi - square and it is not normalized in a way to give true confidence intervals . because the slope of the main - sequence changes with @xmath13 , there is a different weighting given to @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) for each subdwarf .",
    "the minimum chi - square values are for m@xmath10m@xmath69 and e@xmath70 , although the reddening in particular is poorly constrained .",
    "our second approach was to fit the m30 main sequence to the subdwarfs using only the distance modulus as a variable for two e(@xmath71 ) values : 0.02 and 0.06 .",
    "table  [ dmtab ] shows the changes in this value for different subsets of our sample and for different input data .",
    "( the quoted errors include contributions from the scatter of values in the subdwarf fit , a cluster reddening error of 0.02 mag , and the absolute cluster metallicity error of 0.2 dex . ) clearly , reddening uncertainty is dominant in the total uncertainty .",
    "two fits at different reddening are shown in figure  [ subdvred ] .",
    "if we use the value of metal content given by zinn & west ( [ fe / h ] @xmath72 ) along with the carney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) abundance scale for the subdwarfs ( which has roughly the same zero point as zinn & west ) , the distance modulus is increased by only a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "restricting the sample to only metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath73 ) subdwarfs also does not significantly change the distance modulus .    considering the number of distance modulus measurements for m30 in the literature , it is best to try to compare using a common reddening of e@xmath74 ( and using @xmath75 to correct values ) . from the two methods we presented here we have 14.6 and 14.65 . from the pre - hipparcos ground - based measurements of bolte ( 1987 ) and rfv",
    ", we have 14.62 and 14.68 ( the rfv value must also be corrected for their lower assumed metallicity for m30 ) . for the hipparcos - based distances of reid ( 1997 ) and gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we find 14.75 and 14.87 ( although gratton et al .",
    "use only three subdwarfs in their fit ) .",
    "it is clear that our distance moduli are consistent with the ground - based measurements , and over 0.1 mag smaller than the other hipparcos - based measurements .",
    "neverthless , the different distance measures are in good general agreement , at least for a fixed reddening value .",
    "although it is not crucial for the conclusions that follow , we will adopt ( m - m)@xmath76 for the rest of the paper . from figure  [ subdvred ] , it is clear that the smaller reddening and distance modulus values are more consistent with the model isochrones and , for our preferred larger reddening value of e@xmath3 , the models do not match the shape of the m30 fiducial above the turnoff .",
    "the ratio @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the number of rgb stars brighter than the luminosity level of the hb , is the traditional quantity used to estimate the helium abundance of stars in globular clusters . dickens ( 1972 ) first noted that m30 s value for `` r '' was unusually large and alcaino & wamsteker ( 1982 ) claimed a significant gradient in this ratio in the sense of a small value at the center of the cluster increasing to one of the largest measured in any cluster at large radii .",
    "we have sufficient numbers of stars on the red and blue sides of the instability strip to define the level of the hb . from five stars near the blue edge of the instability strip ( with colors @xmath79 ) ,",
    "we calculate an average magnitude @xmath80 . from six stars on the red side of the instability strip ,",
    "we find @xmath81 .",
    "all stars used in these averages were found at radii greater than 10 from the center of the cluster , so that the photometry should be quite accurate .    because the estimate of the hb magnitude is crucial in later arguments , we examine the topic further .",
    "our blue side estimate is consistent with those of bolte ( 1987 ) and bergbusch ( 1996 ) , even with the different calibrations of our respective datasets .",
    "because it is possible that the red hb stars in m30 are evolved , it is wise to check this possibility before simply interpolating between the two sides .",
    "the number of stars ( 8 with projected radius @xmath82 10 , compared to 93 on the blue hb ) at @xmath83 is roughly consistent with timescales for stars evolving from the blue hb , as the evolutionary tracks tend to parallel each other closely through this part of the cmd as they move toward the agb .",
    "thus , we have chosen to look at other clusters of similar metallicity with large , well - studied rr lyrae populations to compute a magnitude correction to go from the red edge of the blue hb into the middle of the instability strip .",
    "for the clusters m15 ( bingham et al .",
    "1984 ) , m68 ( walker 1994 ) , and m92 ( carney et al . 1992 ) we find agreement on a correction of @xmath84 mag .",
    "thus , we have @xmath85 .",
    "to define the rgb star sample for the @xmath5 method , we need to establish the relative bolometric magnitudes of the hb and rgb stars . we have used the hb models of dorman ( 1992 ) in conjunction with the isochrones of bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ; hereafter bv92 ) .",
    "the stellar models involved in these studies were computed with a consistent set of physics and compositions .",
    "although the composition used is somewhat out - of - date , the _ differential _ bolometric corrections should be fine .",
    "the corrections as a function of [ fe / h ] can be approximated by : @xmath86 } + 0.229 \\mbox{[m / h]}^{2 } + 0.034 \\mbox{[m / h]}^{3 } .\\ ] ] because @xmath87-element enhancements influence the position of the hb and rgb in the cmd like a change in [ fe / h ] ( salaris , chieffi , & straniero 1993 ) , they must be taken into account when computing [ m / h ] .    for m30 , we find that @xmath88 .",
    "we have used [ m / h ] @xmath89 ( correcting [ fe / h ] by 0.21 dex for [ @xmath87/fe]@xmath90 ) , although for this range of metallicities , changes in metallicity have a very small effect on @xmath91 .",
    "because of contamination and blending problems toward the center of the cluster , we restrict our samples of rgb and hb stars to @xmath92 . with this choice , we find @xmath93 .",
    "this makes m30 s @xmath5 the highest of any of the clusters examined . in table",

    "photometry exists for the central @xmath94 of m30 from the hubble space telescope ( yanny et al .",
    "1994 ; hereafter ygsb ) .",
    "by merging their list with ours and eliminating common stars , we have created a master list of hb and rgb stars that completely covers the cluster out to 70 , with portions included out to about @xmath95 .",

    "( even if our value of @xmath48 is too bright , and if we use the magnitude of the red edge of the blue hb , we find @xmath97  still a high value in a relative sense . )",
    "this global @xmath5 value for m30 is on firm ground , because there is no place for the bright stars to hide .",
    "the photometry is easily good enough to distinguish between the agb and rgb star samples , so this is not a source of uncertainty .",

    "the use of the lower buzzoni et al .",
    "( 1983 ) value @xmath98 for the differential bolometric correction would increase the high @xmath5 value .",
    "approximately 30 additional rgb stars would have to be included to bring m30 s value in line with that of other clusters  a 24% change in the sample size .",
    "there are a few potential explanations for a _",
    "global _ depletion of bright giants in this cluster .",
    "first , because the ratio @xmath5 is a helium abundance indicator , the abnormally high value could indicate a higher - than - average helium abundance in m30 stars more luminous than the hb .",
    "this does not necessarily imply high y for lower luminosity stars , since a deep - mixing mechanism would also be expected to dredge up freshly produced helium ( sweigart 1997 ) .",
    "second , the environment within the cluster may affect the stellar populations by a mechanism that truncates rgb evolution and/or produces additional hb stars .",
    "we now consider the arguments for the two sides .      using the buzzoni et al .",
    "( 1983 ) calibration and our m30 @xmath5 value , we find @xmath99 . the value derived",
    "using @xmath48 of the blue edge of the instability strip gives @xmath100 .",
    "that @xmath48 is definitely a faint limit , making @xmath101 a lower limit . in any case ,",
    "the @xmath5 value for m30 is significantly higher than those for other clusters when the revised differential bolometric corrections are used .",
    "[ the low value of @xmath102 for the other clusters is discussed in sandquist ( 1998 ) . ]",
    "one check we can make is to examine other helium indicators to see if they also indicate a high abundance relative to other clusters .",
    "caputo , cayrel , & cayrel de strobel ( 1983 ) introduced two indicators : @xmath103 ( the mass - luminosity relation for rr lyrae stars of ab type ) and @xmath6 ( the magnitude difference between the hb and the point on the ms where the dereddened @xmath34 color is 0.7 ) . while m30 s rrab variables have not been studied to the extent necessary to compute @xmath103 , we can compute a @xmath6 value from the @xmath104 photometry of bolte ( 1987 ) and rfv . assuming for both that e@xmath105 , we find @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively , where the primary contributions to the error are the uncertainty in the reddening and the small number of stars used to define the hb magnitude .",

    "the available evidence also suggests that the oxygen enhancement remains constant , at least for [ fe / h ] @xmath138 ( e.g. suntzeff 1993 , carney 1996 ) .    on the rgb ,",
    "stellar evolution is insensitive to the oxygen abundance because the luminosity evolution is driven almost entirely by the helium core mass ( refsdal & weigert 1970 ) , while the color is primarily determined by h@xmath139 opacity .",
    "oxygen has a relatively high ionization potential , and hence does not contribute electrons to the opacity .",
    "the fainter one goes on the ms , the more insensitive the evolution is to the oxygen abundance because of the same opacity effect , and because @xmath140 chain reactions are dominant over cno cycle reactions in influencing the luminosity . as a result ,",
    "the different distribution of heavy elements causes negligible differences in the theoretical lfs on the rgb and lower ms ( see figure 17 of sandquist et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "it is primarily the turnoff region that is affected by changes in the oxygen abundance , because cno cycle reactions begin to become important , and because oxygen ionization regions are close enough to the surface to influence surface temperatures .",
    "increased oxygen abundance increases the envelope opacity , creating redder models . increased",
    "cno cycle activity causes a star to adjust to accommodate the increased luminosity by reducing the temperature and density of the hydrogen burning regions , which results in a net _ decrease _ in the luminosity of the turnoff and sgb relative to solar - ratio models .",
    "thus , the sgb `` jump '' moves in magnitude in the lf . in the cmd",
    ", it also changes slightly in slope , but for metal - poor clusters like m30 , this does not cause a significant change in the shape of the sgb jump in the lf .",
    "an examination of bv92 models indicates that the @xmath13-band lf is not very age - sensitive for this range of metallicities .",
    "it is most sensitive on the sgb and then , as found in sandquist et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , only when the sgb is nearly horizontal in the cmd . in @xmath13 band for a cluster as metal - poor as m30 ,",
    "the sgb has a relatively large slope , and so only a large systematic age error will influence the fit . in light of the _ hipparcos _",

    "figure  [ vlfages ] shows a comparison of the @xmath13-band lf with theoretical lfs for different ages , using an apparent distance modulus of @xmath141 , as derived from one fit to the _ hipparcos _ subdwarf sample .",
    "previous studies of m30 s @xmath13-band lf ( piotto et al . 1987 , bolte 1994 , bergbusch 1996 ) uncovered two unusual features in comparisons with theoretical models : an excess of faint red giants relative to main - sequence stars , and an excess of subgiant stars .",
    "our photometry goes fainter on the ms , allowing us to verify that the normalization of the theoretical models has not been made in an `` abnormal '' section , while our wide field allows us to measure the largest sample of red giants in the cluster to date .",

    "there is excellent agreement .",
    "our lf is significantly below bergbusch s at his faint end , most likely due to underestimated incompleteness corrections in his study . at the bright end of the rgb ( @xmath142 ) ,",
    "our lf points are also below most of bergbusch s .",
    "however , we observed a larger number of giants , and our bins are larger , making our points more significant statistically .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss the main features in the lfs .",
    "there is a apparently a considerable excess of stars on the rgb for @xmath143 ( we will refer to this as the `` lower rgb '' ) when compared to the models normalized to the unevolved main sequence . to judge the reality of the excess",
    ", we need to accurately normalize the theoretical lfs in the horizontal and vertical directions , and choose the photometry subsample to maximize the statistical significance .",
    "the horizontal normalization can be accomplished by shifting the theoretical lf in magnitude so that the to matches that of the observational lf ( stetson 1991a ) . in the vertical direction , we have normalized to the ms in a range of magnitudes where there are large numbers of measured stars , and where incompleteness is a relatively small consideration .",
    "the mass function controls how well the normalized theoretical lf is fit to the ms portion in the present example .",
    "as shown in figure  [ vlffig ] , fits using small values for the power - law mass function exponent @xmath144 indicate that the relative numbers of stars on the rgb and lower ms can be matched by canonical stellar evolution models .",
    "with such a choice though , bins with @xmath145 are not well - modeled .",
    "we find that the lf can be modeled from near the faint limit of our survey to the base of the rgb if we use a higher value for @xmath144 .",
    "this alleviates the depression in the star counts in this magnitude range seen by bolte ( 1994 ) .",
    "however , we are still left with an excess of rgb stars relative to ms stars in the range @xmath146 .",
    "the effects of mass segregation have been previously observed within m30 in the form of a variation of the local mass function exponent @xmath147 with radius ( rfv , bolte 1989 , piotto et al .",
    "1990 , sosin 1997 ) . as a result , the best comparison that can be made would be between theory and a faint sample restricted to the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "the models of pryor , smith , & mcclure ( 1986 ) , as well as observational studies , indicate that restricting the sample to stars more than 20 core radii from the center should minimize the effects of mass segregation on faint end of the lf .",
    "figure  [ vlfrgbms ] shows the lf we computed for this purpose .",
    "the presence of the rgb - ms discrepancy in this case suggests that the problem is not related to the dynamical effects on the mass function , at least in the outskirts",
    ". we can get good overall agreement with the shape of the lf on the ms , but there is a relative excess of rgb stars , and the sgb region is not well fit .",
    "the sgb comparison is insensitive to age and metallicity using this method of matching the msto .",
    "helium abundance , however , has a larger effect ( stetson 1991a ) . because the rgb stars in m30 become more populous relative to hb stars ( and presumably ms stars ) towards the center",
    ", we expect that the cluster core would show a larger discrepancy .    as with the sgb excess",
    ", this effect has only been observed in metal - poor clusters ( in other words , not in the lfs of ngc 288 or m5 ) . to add stars to the canonical number at a point in the red giant lf , one must either increase the hydrogen content of the mass being fed into the hydrogen - burning shell , or reduce the density or temperature of the burning shell .",
    "one possibility for the excess stars on the lower rgb is that we are seeing the effects of deep mixing , which brings hydrogen - rich envelope material into the energy generating shell .",
    "if this kind of mixing occurred on the lower rgb , it could eliminate the rgb bump by erasing the chemical discontinuity left by a surface convection zone .",
    "alternately , vandenberg , larson , & depropris ( 1998 ) have examined the effects of rotation on rgb evolution .",
    "they found that core rotation can expand the outer portions of the stellar core enough to cause a reduction of the shell temperature .",
    "this results in a decrease in the rate of evolution for rgb stars , and hence leads to an increase in the number of stars per luminosity bin .",
    "this is in the correct direction to explain the rgb excess .",
    "this rotation could be related to deep mixing scenarios that are required to explain abundance anomalies in rgb stars ( e.g. shetrone 1996 )  most notably a decline in the @xmath148c/@xmath149c ratio relative to theoretical predictions , and na - o and al - o anti - correlations ( as surface material is mixed into regions where o is being converted to n in the cno cycle ) . [",
    "note that rotation _ can not _",
    "explain subgiant branch excesses because the burning region in core - burning stages is too small to contain a significant amount of angular momentum ( vandenberg 1995 ) .",
    "even if rotation does affect the structure of the star outside the core , and thereby changes the core temperature , this would not produce isothermalization that would lead to sgb excesses . ]    the rotation and mixing pictures ( with the assumption that mixing is somehow based on internal rotation ) receive some support from observations of rotation in hb stars of some clusters .",
    "there is definite evidence of stellar rotation in blue hb stars in ngc 288 , m3 , and m13 ( peterson , rood , & crocker 1995 ) .",
    "m13 has the fastest rotators , with stars falling into two groups : some with @xmath150 km s@xmath122 , and some with @xmath151 km s@xmath122 .",
    "m3 has a @xmath152 distribution consistent with @xmath153 km s@xmath122 , while ngc 288 s stars are consistent with @xmath154 km s@xmath122 .",
    "cohen & mccarthy ( 1997 ) also found projected rotation rates between 15 and 40 km s@xmath122 for five blue hb stars in m92 .",
    "the presence of stellar rotation on the hb implies that angular momentum may have been stored during the rgb phase in a rapidly rotating core , avoiding loss of angular momentum through the stellar wind .",
    "( such mass loss is needed to be able to create hb stars of appropriate masses to match observed cluster hb morphologies . )",
    "if this is true , it would be particularly interesting to compare lfs for m3 and m13 to look for the effects of rotation , and perhaps even different levels of rotation .",
    "further stellar rotation measurements for m30 , m68 , and m92 would also be helpful in examining rotation as a cause of ms - rgb discrepancy in the combined lf .",

    "that result shows that the continuation of the fusi pecci et al .",

    "[ vlfsgb ] , we plot the lf with a radius cut closer to the cluster center so as to get better statistics on the sgb . as figure",

    "an examination of the @xmath14-band lf in figure  [ ilf ] shows the presence of a deviation at the same position in the cmd .",
    "this is important because the slope of the sgb is steeper in an @xmath167 cmd than in a @xmath168 cmd . as a result",

    "so , the sgb excess has marginal significance in our lfs . in order",

    "there is , however , a general lack of useful lf data covering the sgb for globular clusters with metallicities between m5 and m30 , or more metal rich than m5",

    "the colors for these standards cover the range @xmath186 and @xmath187        both the ctio 4  m and 1.5  m data for m30 were reduced using the standard suite of programs developed by peter stetson ( daophot / allstar ; stetson 1987 , 1989 ) , and following the procedures in sandquist et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "we used the secondary standards established with the 1.5  m observations on the single photometric night to determine the coefficients in the transformation equations for all of the 1.5  m profile fitting photometry : @xmath188 @xmath189 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the instrumental magnitudes from the profile fitting , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the standard values from the aperture photometry , and @xmath190 is an index referring to individual frames .",
    "the coefficients of the color terms are given in table  [ coeftab ] , the average residuals and standard deviation of the residuals for the comparison of the profile fitting and aperture photometry are given in table  [ restab ] , and individual star residuals are shown in figure  [ aptopsf ] .    in the next step , we chose to calibrate the 4  m profile fitting photometry to the 1.5  m profile fitting photometry rather than the aperture photometry of the secondary standards .",
    "this was done primarily to ensure that all of our profile fitting was on the same system over as large a range of magnitudes as possible .",
    "the m30 frames taken at the 1.5  m telescope on the one photometric night did not go particularly deep , while the 4 m photometry had few unsaturated observations of the brighter stars in the cluster .",
    "the data taken on the non - photometric nights at the 1.5 m telescope did , however , cover a range of magnitudes similar to that of the 4 m data .",
    "we selected a sample of 248 stars found in both fields at least 300 pixels away from the cluster center .",
    "these stars were used to determine the transformation coefficients for the equations : @xmath191 @xmath192 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the instrumental magnitudes from the 4  m observations , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the standard values from the 1.5  m observations .",
    "the coefficients of the color terms are given in table  [ coeftab ] , while the residuals of the comparison of the photometry for the 4  m and 1.5  m measurements of the secondary standards are shown in figure  [ secres ] .",
    "for the final calibration , we used the transformation equations for the 1.5  m and 4  m profile - fitting data .",
    "all of the profile - fitting photometry from both telescopes was combined with weights equal to the inverse square of the internal measurement errors in order to determine our standard - system magnitude and color values .    because of the large sky coverage of the ctio frames , most other surveys of m30 overlap the program area at least partially .",
    "table  [ restab ] provides a summary of the zero - point offsets for comparisons with these studies .",
    "we would particularly like to point out that there is considerable difference among them , highlighting the importance of the calibration .",
    "the fields used by bolte ( 1987 ) , rfv , and samus et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are completely included on all frames .",
    "a comparison with the photometry of bolte is given in figure  [ boltecomp ] . in figure",
    "[ alccomp ] , we show the comparison with the study of m30 by samus et al . (",
    "we do this partly because it involves the same filter bands , and partly because the residuals are the lowest on average ( although the scatter in star - to - star residuals is large ) . as a note ,",
    "comparisons with the most recent study ( bergbusch 1996 ) show no signs of color trends in the residuals except within about a magnitude of the tip of the giant branch .",
