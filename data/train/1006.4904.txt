    "in 1999 , d. molodtsov @xcite , introduced the notion of a soft set as a collection of approximate descriptions of an object .",
    "this initial description of the object has an approximate nature , and we do not need to introduce the notion of exact solution .",
    "the absence of any restrictions on the approximate description in soft sets make this theory very convenient and easily applicable in practice .",
    "applications of soft sets in areas ranging from decision problems to texture classification , have surged in recent years @xcite .",
    "similarity measures quantify the extent to which different patterns , signals , images or sets are alike .",
    "such measures are used extensively in the application of fuzzy sets , intuitionistic fuzzy set and vague sets to the problems of pattern recognition , signal detection , medical diagnosis and security verification systems .",
    "that is why several researchers have studied the problem of similarity measurement between fuzzy sets @xcite , intuitionistic fuzzy sets ( ifss ) and vague sets .",
    "ground breaking work for introducing similarity measure of soft sets was presented by majumdar and samanta in @xcite .",
    "their work uses matrix representation based distances of soft sets to introduce similarity measures . in this paper , we propose new similarity measures using set theoretic operations , besides showing how the earlier similarity measures of majumdar and samanta are inappropriate .",
    "we also present an application of the proposed measures of similarity in the area of automated financial analysis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , requisite preliminary notions from soft set theory have been presented .",
    "section 3 comprises some counterexamples to show that some claims in @xcite are not correct . at the end of this section",
    "we also improve and generalize lemma 4.4 of @xcite . in section 4",
    "we give our motivation and rationale to introduce set operations based distance and similarity measures .",
    "section 5 introduces the notion of set operation based distance between soft sets and some of its weaker forms . in section 6",
    "similarity measures have been defined .",
    "finally section 7 is the application of new similarity measures to the problem of financial diagnosis of firms .",
    "a pair @xmath0 is called a soft set @xcite over @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a mapping given by @xmath3 in other words , a soft set over @xmath1 is a parametrized family of subsets of the universe @xmath4 for @xmath5 @xmath6 may be considered as the set of @xmath7-approximate elements of the soft set @xmath0 .",
    "clearly a soft set is not a set in ordinary sense .",
    "@xcite let @xmath1 be a universe and @xmath8 a set of attributes .",

    "the quantity @xmath69 is either @xmath70 or @xmath71 only .",
    "consequently , the term @xmath72 used for defining distances @xmath73 and @xmath74 , comes out to be identical with @xmath75this renders @xmath73 and @xmath74 as mere square roots of @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively . symbolically we write:@xmath78hence the four distances of majumdar and samanta are not distinct , rather they are only two distances .    in the sequel the cardinality of a set @xmath79 is denoted as @xmath80 .",
    "we now present the main result of this section as :    [ mainresult]let @xmath81 .",

    "the work of majumdar and samanta depends solely upon the tacit assumption that matrix representation of soft sets is a suitable representation .",
    "we now discuss the validity of this assumption .",
    "tabular representation of a soft set was first proposed by maji , biswas and roy in @xcite .",
    "this representation readily lends itself to become majumdar and samanta s matrix representation as given in @xcite .",
    "hence , in the sequal , we shall use the words ` table representation ' and ` matrix representation ' interchangeably .",
    "furthermore , we shall term a soft set in a soft space @xmath32 as ` total soft set ' if the soft set , which is a mapping , is defined on each point of the universe of attributes @xmath106 hence @xmath107 is a total soft set in the soft space @xmath9 but @xmath108 , with @xmath109 is not .",
    "it is noteworthy that the matrix representation compels one to write every soft set as a total soft set .",
    "consequently neither matrix representation is unique , nor it returns the original soft set .",
    "this is shown by the following example :    let @xmath32 be a soft space with @xmath54 and @xmath55 choose@xmath110then its matrix representation is given as@xmath111if we try to retrieve , the soft set @xmath27 from @xmath112 we get@xmath113which is clearly a different soft set in @xmath32 as @xmath114 but @xmath115 and hence @xmath116    moreover , it is evident by the very definition of soft union as given by maji _ et.al . _",
    "that total soft sets are not meant by either molodstov @xcite or maji , biswas and roy @xcite .",
    "had this been the case , the soft union should not have been defined in three pieces .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note that in @xcite , while calculating the similarity only the value sets of a soft set have been paid attention to . whereas , ideally a similarity measure for soft sets must reflect similarity between both the value sets and the attributes , due to the peculiar dependance of the notion of soft set upon these two sets .",
    "both the above given points viz .",
    "non - suitability of matrix representation and partial nature of similarity measures of majumdar and samanta , provide us motivation to introduce more suitable distance and similarity measures of soft sets .",
    "we introduce these measures in the following sections .",
