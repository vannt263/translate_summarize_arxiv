    "by means of network densification , small cell networks ( scns ) can achieve a high spatial reuse gain , which further leads to a high network capacity  @xcite .",
    "particularly , the orthogonal deployment of scns within the existing macrocell network , i.e. , small cells and macrocells operating on different frequency spectrum ( small cell scenario # 2a defined in  @xcite ) , is prioritized in the design of the 4th generation ( 4 g ) long term evolution ( lte ) networks by the 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) .",
    "furthermore , dense scns are envisaged to be the workhorse for capacity enhancement in the 5th generation ( 5 g ) networks due to its large performance gains and easy deployment  @xcite .",
    "thus , this paper focuses on studying the performance of these orthogonal deployments of dense scns .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we conducted a study on the downlink ( dl ) of dense scns considering a sophisticated path loss model that differentiates * line - of - sight * ( los ) and * non - line - of - sight * ( nlos ) transmissions .",
    "los transmission may occur when the distance between a transmitter and a receiver is small , and nlos transmission is more common in office environments and in central business districts .",
    "moreover , the probability that there exists a los path between the transmitter and the receiver increases as their distance decreases .",
    "it is observed in  @xcite that the reduction of the distance between the transmitter and the receiver as the density of small cell base stations ( bss ) increases will cause a transition from nlos transmission to los transmission , which has a significant impact , both quantitatively and qualitatively , on the performance of dl dense scns . motivated by this finding  @xcite , in this paper",
    ", we continue to query whether such nlos - to - los transitions may significantly affect the performance of uplink ( ul ) dense scns .",
    "our work distinguishes from existing work  @xcite on the performance analysis of ul dense scns in three major aspects .",
    "first , we assume a user association strategy ( uas ) that each ue is associated with the bs with the smallest path loss to the ue , or equivalently each ue is associated with the bs that delivers the strongest received signal strength  @xcite .",
    "note that in our previous work  @xcite and existing work in the literature  @xcite , the authors assumed that each ue should be associated with the closest bs .",
    "such assumption is not appropriate for the realistic path loss model with los and nlos transmissions , because in practice it is possible for a ue to associate with a bs that is not the closest one but with a los path , instead of the nearest bs with a nlos path .",
    "second , we assume that the bss and the ues are deployed according to two independent * homogeneous poisson point processes ( hppps ) , * which is more practical and realistic compared with the previous work  @xcite .",
    "third , we consider the correlation of bs and ue positions explained later in the paper , thus making our numerical results more accurate than the previous work  @xcite , which ignored such correlation .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows :    * numerically tractable results are obtained for the ul coverage probability and the ul area spectral efficiency ( ase ) performance using a piecewise path loss model , incorporating both los and nlos transmissions . * our theoretical analysis of the ul of dense scns shows a similar performance trend that was found for the dl of dense scns in our previous work  @xcite , i.e. , when the density of ues is larger than a threshold , + the ase may suffer from a slow growth or even a decrease .",
    "then , the ase will grow almost linearly as the ue density increases above another larger threshold .",
    "this finding is in stark contrast with previous results using a simplistic path loss model that does not differentiate los and nlos transmissions  @xcite . *",
    "our theoretical analysis also indicates that the performance impact of los and nlos transmissions on the ul of scns with _ ul power compensation _ is significant both quantitatively and qualitatively compared with existing work in the literature that does not differentiate los and nlos transmissions . * the details of the ul power compensation scheme",
    "will be introduced in section  [ sec : network - model ] . * in particular , the previous work  @xcite showed that a larger ul power compensation factor should always deliver a better ase performance in the practical range of bs density , i.e. , @xmath0 .",
    "however , our results show that a smaller ul power compensation factor can greatly boost the ase performance in dense scns , i.e. , @xmath1 , while a larger ul power compensation factor is more suitable for sparse scns , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "our new finding indicates that it is possible to save ue battery and meanwhile obtain a high ase in the ul of dense scns in 5 g , if the ul power compensation factor is optimized .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : related - work ] compares the closest related work to our work .",
    "section  [ sec : network - model ] describes the system model . *",
    "section [ sec : analysis - proposed ] presents our main analytical results on the ul coverage probability and the ul ase .",
    "* section  [ sec : ul - analysis ] presents * the application of * our main analytical results on the ul coverage probability and the ul ase * in a 3gpp special case * , followed by a more efficient computation method to evaluate the results using the gauss - laguerre quadrature .",
    "the numerical results and simulation results are discussed in section  [ sec : simulaiton - and - discussion ] .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the dl performance analysis of cellular networks based on stochastic geometry , bs positions are typically modeled as a homogeneous poisson point process ( hppp ) on the plane  @xcite , and in this case , the coverage probability can be expressed in a closed - form . *",
    "furthermore , an important and novel capacity model was proposed for hppp random cellular networks , where the impact of random interference on the cooperative communications is analyzed by a closed - form expression *  @xcite**. * * in the ul performance analysis of cellular networks based on stochastic geometry , ue positions are typically modeled as a hppp on the plane  @xcite , and bs positions are assumed to be uniformly and randomly deployed in the voronoi cell of each ue . the difficulty of modeling both bss and ues as a hppp is that the * bs * * and ue * positions are coupled  @xcite , and the dependence of ue positions is therefore hard to analyse .",
    "such dependence occurs because if a ue is associated with a bs that delivers the strongest received signal ( or is closest to the ue ) , it implies that there are no other bss that can be located in positions that deliver the strongest received signal ( or in a closer distance than the aforementioned bs ) . to derive tractable and closed - form results , previous work ignored this dependence and modeled the distance between a ue and its associated bs as an independent identical distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variable .    in greater detail , in  @xcite",
    ", the authors assumed that the ues are randomly distributed following a hppp , and exactly one bs is randomly and uniformly located in each ue s voronoi cell , i.e. , each bs associates with its nearest ue .",
    "it is also assumed that the distance between each bs and its serving ue is i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh distributed .",
    "the system model of only deploying ues as a hppp  @xcite makes it difficult to conduct network performance analysis for ul of scns .",
    "furthermore , the association strategy that each bs associates with its nearest ue  @xcite is impractical , and the assumption that all of the bs - ue association distances are i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh distributed  @xcite is unrealistic .    in  @xcite , the authors considered ue spatial blocking , which is referred to as the outage caused by limited number of usable channels , and derived approximate expressions for the ul blocking probability and the ul coverage probability . in  @xcite , the authors proposed a tractable model to characterize the ul rate distribution in a @xmath3-tier heterogeneous cellular networks ( hcns ) considering power control and load balancing . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered the maximum power limitation for ues and obtained approximate expressions for the ul outage probability and ul spectral efficiency .",
    "however , none of the aforementioned ul related work considered a realistic path loss model with line - of - sight ( los ) and non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) transmissions . in contrast , in this paper , we consider a sophisticated path loss model incorporating both los and nlos transmissions to study their performance impact on dense scns and show that los and nlos transmissions have a significant impact on the performance of ul dense scns .",
    "los and nlos transmissions have been previously investigated in the dl performance analysis of dense scns  @xcite .",
    "one major conclusion of  @xcite is that the ase performance will slowly increase or even decrease in certain bs density regions .",
    "it is interesting to see whether this conclusion holds for ul dense scns . in our previous work * on the ul performance analysis of dense scns *  @xcite , we assume that each ue is associated with its nearest bs , which may not be a practical assumption * when considering * los and nlos transmissions . compared with  @xcite , in this work we consider * a * more realistic user association strategy , * in which * a ue associates with the bs that has the smallest path loss , or equivalently delivers the strongest received signal strength .",
    "this user association strategy is more realistic and is particularly important when considering both los and nlos transmissions that are present in realistic radio environment , because the closest bs may possibly have only a nlos path to the ue and therefore * may offer * a weaker signal than a bs that is further away but has a los path to the ue .",
    "different from the assumption that only ues deployment follows hppp distribution  @xcite , in this paper , we assume that both bss and ues are distributed following hppps with densities @xmath4  @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xmath7 , respectively . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath8 so that all the bss are activated to serve * at least one ue*. each ue is assumed to associate with the bs with the smallest path loss .",
    "we focus on ul and consider a randomly tagged bs , which is denoted as the typical bs located at the origin . with the assumption of @xmath8 , on each time - frequency resource block , each bs has one active ue in its coverage area . the ue associated with the typical bs is denoted as the typical ue , and the other ues using the same time - frequency resource block are denoted as the interfering ues .",
    "the distance from the typical ue to the typical bs is denoted by @xmath9 , which is a random variable whose distribution will be analyzed later . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the upper case letters , e.g. , @xmath9 , to denote a random variable and use the lower case letters , e.g. , @xmath10 , to denote specific instance of the random variable .    the link from the typical ue to the typical bs",

    "as for the practical range of @xmath4 for the existing and the future cellular networks , i.e. , @xmath0  @xcite , the ase trend is interesting .",
    "first , when @xmath145 $ ] , where @xmath136 is around 20 and @xmath142 ( @xmath146 ) is around 125 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ase ] , the ase exhibits a slow - down in the rate of growth    due to the fast decrease of coverage probability shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coverage vs density ] . thereafter , when @xmath147 , the ase exhibits an acceleration in the growth rate due to the slow - down in the decrease of coverage probability also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coverage vs density ] .",
    "our finding , the ase may * exhibits a slow - down in the rate of growth * as the bs density increases , is similar to our results reported for the dl of scns  @xcite , which indicates the significant impact of the path loss model incorporating both nlos and los transmissions .",
    "such impact makes a difference for dense scns in terms of the ase both quantitatively and qualitatively , comparing to that with a simplistic path loss model that does not differentiate los and nlos transmissions .",
    "our proposed analysis also shows another important finding .",
    "a smaller ul power compensation factor @xmath137 ( e.g. , @xmath139 ) can greatly boost the ase performance in 5 g dense scns  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath1 , while a larger @xmath137 ( e.g. , @xmath138 ) is more suitable for sparse scns , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "this contradicts the results in  @xcite where a larger ul power compensation factor was predicted to always result in a better ase in the practical range of bs density , i.e. , @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ase ] .",
    "therefore , our theoretical analysis indicates that the performance impact of los and nlos transmissions on ul scns with ul power compensation is also significant both quantitatively and qualitatively , compared with the previous work in  @xcite that does not differentiate los and nlos transmissions .",
    "interestingly , our new finding implies that its is possible to save ue battery and meanwhile achieve a high ase in the ul of 5 g dense scns , if @xmath137 is optimized .",
    "the intuition is that in dense scns , the network experiences a surplus of strong los interference instead of shortage of ul transmission power , and thus reducing the transmission powers of a large number of interferers turns out to be a good strategy that enhances the ase .",
    "note that our conclusion is made from the investigated set of parameters , and it is of significant interest to further study the generality of this conclusion in other network models and with other parameter sets .      in this subsection",
    ", we change the value of @xmath149 from 2.09 to 1.09 and 3.09 , respectively , to investigate the performance impact of @xmath149 . in fig .",

    "[ fig : pcov_different_alphal ] , the smaller the @xmath149 , the larger the difference between the nlos path loss exponent @xmath151 and @xmath149 . as a result ,",
    "performance impact of the transition of interference from the nlos transmission to the los transmission becomes more drastic as @xmath4 increases .",
    "in other words , the slow growth    of the @xmath150 is more obvious to observe .",
    "for example , when @xmath149 takes a near - field path loss exponent such as 1.09 , the decrease of the @xmath150 at @xmath145\\textrm { bss / km}^{2}$ ] is substantial and it hardly recovers after @xmath142 .    as has been discussed in the subsection [ sub : coverage_vs_density ] , when the scn is sparse , adopting a higher @xmath137 leads to a higher coverage probability .",
    "however , as @xmath4 increases , adopting a lower @xmath137 leads to a higher coverage probability . the bs density around which the coverage probability with smaller @xmath137 surpasses that with larger @xmath137 is defined as the transition point of @xmath137 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pcov_different_alphal ] , the transition point of various @xmath137 increases as @xmath149 increases .",
    "it indicates that in dense scns with smaller @xmath149 , the coverage probability using a smaller @xmath137 can soon outperform that using a larger @xmath137 as the scn becomes denser .      * in this subsection , we investigate the ul ase performance assuming a more complicated path loss model , in which the los probability is defined as follows  @xcite *    * *    * @xmath152 *    * where @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 .",
    "the simulation results of the area spectral efficiency @xmath140 vs. the bs density is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : ase_36828 ] , the numerical result for @xmath136 is around @xmath156 .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the impact of a piecewise linear path loss model incorporating both los and nlos transmissions in the performance of the ul of dense scns .",
    "analytical results were obtained for the coverage probability and the ase performance .",
    "the results show that los and nlos transmissions have a significant impact in the ase of the ul of dense scns , both quantitatively and qualitatively , compared with previous works that does not differentiate los and nlos transmissions .",
