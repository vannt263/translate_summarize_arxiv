    "the well established standard neutrino oscillation framework satisfactory explains most of neutrino data .",
    "it relies on three flavours ( @xmath3 ) , mixture of three mass states ( @xmath4 ) separated by squared mass differences of @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite , where `` sol  and ' ' atm  stand historically for solar and atmospheric experiments providing compelling evidence for neutrino oscillation ( see  @xcite and references therein for a recent review ) . beyond this minimal extension of the standard model , anomalous results",
    "have been reported in lsnd  @xcite , miniboone  @xcite , and radioactive source experiments  @xcite .",
    "in addition a new evaluation of the reactor neutrino fluxes  @xcite led to a reinterpretation of the results of short baseline reactor experiments  @xcite , the so - called reactor antineutrino anomaly .",
    "if not related to non understood experimental issues , results of the global fit of short - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments ( see  @xcite for instance ) show that the data can be explained by the addition of one or two sterile neutrinos to the three active neutrinos of the standard model , the so - called ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 3 + 2 ) scenarios , respectively .",
    "however some tension remains between appearance and disappearance data in the global fits , see  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that sterile neutrinos would affect the oscillation probabilities of the active flavors and therefore could influence cosmological processes  @xcite .",
    "these aspects wo nt be further discussed in this experimental review focusing on terrestrial experiments , but more details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in this section we focus on neutrino oscillation results with an l / e of about 1  m / mev .",
    "a comprehensive review of all short baseline oscillation results and detailed statments on the current oscillation anomalies can be found in  @xcite .    in 1995",
    "the lsnd experiment reported an excess in the @xmath7 appearance channel  @xcite .",
    "a similar experiment , karmen  @xcite , did not report such an excess , however . in 2002",
    "the miniboone experiment confirmed this excess in both @xmath8 to @xmath9 and @xmath10 to @xmath11 channels  @xcite .",
    "the miniboone results will be soon complemented by using a 170-ton lar tpc in the same neutrino beam ; the microboone experiment  @xcite will check if the low - energy excess is due to @xmath8 charged current quasielastic events .",
    "event rates measured by many reactor experiments at short distances , when compared with a newly evaluated antineutrino flux , are indicating the disappearance of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "in addition the results from the gallium solar neutrino calibration experiments reported also a deficit of @xmath8 in a similar l / e range  @xcite .",
    "the individual significances of these anomalies lie between 2.5 to 3.8 @xmath12 , and these results , not fitting the three - neutrino - flavor framework , are difficult to explain by systematics effects . if not experimental artifacts it is puzzling that each of them could be explained by oscillation to sterile neutrinos with a large mass squared difference , @xmath13 , corresponding to an l / e of about 1  m / mev .",
    "indeed the minimal neutrino mixing scheme provides only two squared - mass differences .",
    "a third one would be required for new short - baseline neutrino oscillations .",
    "it then require the introduction of a sterile neutrino @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the minimal model consists of a hierarchical 3 + 1 neutrino mixing , acting as a perturbation of the standard three - neutrino mixing in which the three active neutrinos @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are mainly composed of three massive neutrinos @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 with light masses @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the sterile neutrino would mainly be composed of a heavy neutrino @xmath24 with mass @xmath25 such that @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .    in 3 + 1",
    "neutrino mixing , the effective flavor transition and survival probabilities in short - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and for @xmath30 , with the transition amplitudes @xmath31    the interpretation of both lsnd and miniboone anomalies in terms of light sterile neutrino oscillations requires mixing of the sterile neutrino with both electron and muon neutrinos .",
    "in addition , both opera and icarus experiments recently reported negative results for the search @xmath8 from the @xmath9 cngs beam  @xcite , although not testing fully the relevant space of oscillation parameters .",
    "therefore when considering all data together no satisfactory global fit can be obtained ( see  @xcite for instance ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the non - observation of @xmath9 disappearance at the ev - scale  @xcite , that is a generic prediction if the lsnd signal implies a sterile neutrino .",
    "this negative results is not strong enough to rule out this hypothesis , however .",
    "all these facts motivate the experimental program being briefly summarized in this review . in what follows ,",
    "we focus on the 3 active + 1 sterile neutrino mixing scheme with @xmath32 of the order of .",
    "to definitively test the short baseline oscillation hypothesis the new experiments must be sensitive to an oscillation pattern either in the energy spectrum , or in the spatial distribution of the neutrino interactions , or both . to cover the @xmath33 region of with mev / gev",
    "neutrinos the distance between the emitter and the detector has to be on the scale of  1 - 10  m  /  1 - 10 km , respectively .",
    "statistical and systematics uncertainties must be at the level of a few percents or less .",
    "such an experiment could be performed close to nuclear reactors , with intense radioactive sources used as neutrino emitters , or with accelerator based experiments .",
    "we review below the various projects that have been proposed to clarify the neutrino anomalies , leaving out r&d efforts .",
    "nuclear reactors are very intense sources of 1 - 10 mev electron antineutrinos . in",
    "the 80 s their expected fluxes were obtained with a precision of 5% through the measurement of the integral @xmath34-spectra of uranium and plutonium isotopes irradiated into a reactor core , followed by their phenomenological conversion into @xmath10 spectra  @xcite .",
    "but in 2011 this prediction of was corrected leading to an increase of the emitted flux by about 4% , with a similar precision  @xcite .",
    "the revised comparison of the latest with the measured rate of interactions in detectors located at 100 m or less from the cores revealed the reactor antineutrino anomaly  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that there remains some lack of knowledge of the reactor neutrino fluxes .",
    "it has been recently pointed out that the detailed treatment of forbidden transitions in the computation of reactor neutrino spectra may lead to an increase of the systematic uncertainty by a few percents  @xcite . moreover , while writing this article a new deviation with respect to the expected reactor neutrino spectral shape predictions  @xcite has been announced by the reno and double chooz collaborations at the neutrino 2014 conference  @xcite , and confirmed later by the daya bay collaboration at the ichep 2014 conference  @xcite .",
    "this deviation in the prompt signal energy spectrum is being observed between about 4 to 7 mev ( visible energy ) with a significance of more than 3 standard deviations .",
    "the origin of this structure is still unknown .",
    "therefore further investigations of reactor neutrino spectra as well as more precise data are needed .",
    "new reactor experiments searching for short baseline oscillation , with l / e@xmath351 m / mev , should first look for an oscillation pattern imprinted in the energy distribution of events .",
    "of course the analysis must be complemented by an integral rate measurement .",
    "according to global fits the relevant range of oscillation lengths , @xmath36 is between 1 and 10 meters .",
    "therefore short baselines , a few ten s of meters , are mandatory and compact reactor cores , with typical dimensions of 1 m , are preferable in comparison with larger commercial reactors to prevent washing out the hypothetical oscillation pattern at the l / e s of interest .",
    ".main features of proposed reactor experiments . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     experimentally the detection technique of most experiments in preparation relies on the inverse @xmath34-decay ( ibd ) reaction , @xmath10 + p @xmath37 e@xmath38 + n , where the positron carries out the @xmath10 energy while the neutron tagging provides a discriminant signature against backgrounds .",
    "indeed an accidental pair from @xmath39-ray radioactivity contaminants or induced by the reactor core , followed by a neutron capture or a high energy @xmath39 from the core could easily mimic the signal .",
    "this background can partially be suppressed through passive shielding while the remaining contribution can be measured in - situ at the analysis stage , leading to an increase of the uncertainty due to statistical fluctuations of the background rate , however .",
    "correlated backgrounds induced by cosmic rays can also alter the signal . by definition",
    "a single correlated event can mimic the ibd process .",
    "all currents projects are foreseen at shallow depths or even at the surface , the latter case being extremely challenging and not yet experimentally demonstrated at the desired precision .",
    "more problematic could be the possible correlated backgrounds induced by the reactor core itself",
    ". it must be suppressed through passive shielding , depending strongly on the site configuration and on the type of reactor core .",
    "this background superimposes on the top of the signal and it can not be measured in situ , unfortunately .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to optimize the experimental setup through simulation to minimize it , while taking large safety margins due to the difficulty of assessing the remaining contribution in the fiducial volume .",
    "table  [ tab : reactorexp ] provides a list of current projects being carried out at reactors .",
    "the nucifer experiment  @xcite is currently taking data close to the osiris nuclear reactor in saclay .",
    "though not optimized for a sterile neutrino search it could provide first new constraints by 2015 . the stereo experiment  @xcite will be constructed next to the ill reactor in grenoble in 2014 and aims taking data middle of 2015 .",
    "the danss  @xcite and neutrino4  @xcite experiments are under construction in russia and should provide first data in 2015 .",
    "finally a comprehensive project for searching sterile neutrinos at reactor in us is currently in its r&d phase  @xcite ; depending on its approval schedule it could provide first results by 2016 .",
    "all these experiments are designed to test the space of parameters deduced from the interpretation of reactor antineutrino anomaly through the existence of light sterile neutrinos .     projected sensitivity curves for proposed neutrino generator and reactor experiments plotted against the global fits for the gallium anomaly and reactor anomaly respectively , based on the compilation of  @xcite . ]      in the experiments performed to calibrate the radiochemical solar neutrino detectors sage and gallex the number of measured capture events for neutrinos from artificial sources of @xmath40cr and @xmath41ar are below the expectations , the average ratio of the measured - to - expected capture - rate being 0.87 @xmath42 0.05 [ 5 ] .",
    "new experiments have been proposed to clarify this anomaly , using a very intense @xmath40cr neutrino generator at baksan ( 3 mci ) or next to the borexino detector ( 10 mci ) . on the other hand",
    "an experiment using 100 kci of @xmath43ce-@xmath43pr could be used next to a large liquid scintillator detector , such as borexino or kamland , to directly test the reactor antineutrino anomaly .",
    "those projects aims to search for an energy - dependent oscillating pattern in event spatial distribution of active neutrino interactions that would unambiguously determine neutrino mass differences and mixing angles if oscillation to light sterile neutrinos is the explanation of the gallium and/or reactor neutrino anomalies .",
    "we review below these proposals .      a neutrino",
    "source uses the electron capture process to produce monoenergetic neutrinos .",
    "several neutrino sources have already been produced to calibrate radiochemical solar neutrino experiments .",
    "two nuclei are usually considered : @xmath40cr and @xmath41ar .",
    "the @xmath40cr decays with a half - life , producing mainly neutrinos , and in of decays neutrinos with a gamma , while the @xmath41ar produces neutrinos in any case with a half - life .",
    "the @xmath41ar is therefore more suitable from the point of vue of heat and shielding issues , and benefits also of slightly longer half - life and slightly higher energy .",
    "still chromium is much easier to handle .",
    "both isotopes have to be produced by neutron irradiation in a nuclear reactor , through @xmath44cr ( n,@xmath39 ) @xmath40cr process and @xmath45na ( n,@xmath46 ) @xmath41ar process respectively .",
    "moreover , the ( n,@xmath46 ) reaction has a threshold requiring irradiation with fast neutron .",
    "the main drawback of neutrino source relies in the detection process , elastic scattering off electrons .",
    "the cross section of this process is low and the detection is very sensitive to backgrounds .",
    "currently only borexino , design to study solar neutrinos , has shown a low enough background control .",
    "the unique extreme radiopurity achieved in the liquid scintillator medium allows to control the irreducible contribution of @xmath47be solar neutrinos .",
    "the experiment will consist in counting the number of observed events at each detector location and to compare it to the expectation without oscillations .",
    "the position of each event can be reconstructed with a precision of @xmath3512  cm at 1  mev , which is enough for the range of @xmath33 of interest and smaller than the size of the source , a few tens of centimeters .",
    "the sox experiment  @xcite will perform such an measurement with a @xmath40c source irradiated either in russia ( pa mayak ) or in us , and deployed at 8.25 m from the center of the borexino detector in 2016/17 .    at baksan",
    "another technique is being pursued .",
    "based on the technology developed for the sage solar neutrinos experiment a @xmath40cr source could be placed at the center of a target , containing 50 t of liquid metallic gallium divided in two areas , an inner 8-ton zone and an outer 42-ton zone .",
    "the ratio of the two measured capture rate to its expectation could sign an oscillation , although not as precisely as for the oscillometry performed in a liquid scintillator detector .",
    "this is a well - proven technique free of backgrounds , however .",
    "furthermore it would necessitate a lower activity , 3 mci , more easy to achieve from standard irradiation in research reactors and logistic issues would be easier to organize since both the source and the detector would remain in russia .",
    "an antineutrino source uses the @xmath48 decay process to produce a non monoenergetic neutrino spectrum .",
    "antineutrinos allow the use of inverse beta decay ( ibd ) as detection process : @xmath49 .",
    "at a few mev s it has the advantage of a higher cross - section with respect to neutrino scattering off electrons , by roughly one order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore the time and space coincidence between positron and neutron allow a very effective tagging of the process , leading to much easier background rejection .",
    "the main drawback is the energy threshold requiring a high q - value @xmath48 decay . since the period and the q - value are strongly anticorrelated for @xmath48 decay",
    ", this requirement leads to nuclei with a period shorter than the day , preventing the effective production and use of an antineutrino source based on a single isotope .",
    "the solution relies on the use of a cascade of two @xmath48 decays , the father having a long period ( month or year scale ) and the daughter having a q - value above the ibd threshold , as high as possible to maximize the event rate .",
    "several pairs of isotope have been identified but we ll focus on the best option .    the celand and cesox experiments plan to use 100 kci of @xmath43ce in kamland  @xcite and borexino  @xcite .",
    "cerium was chosen because of its high @xmath50 , its @xmath354% abundance in fission products of uranium and plutonium , and finally for engineering considerations related to its possible extraction of rare earth from regular spent nuclear fuel reprocessing followed by a customized column chromatography . while not minimizing the difficulty of doing this , the nuclear industry does have the technology to produce sources of the appropriate intensity , at a high purity level .",
    "the goal is to deploy the @xmath43ce radioisotope about 10 m away from the detector center and to search for an oscillating pattern in both event spatial and energy distributions that would determine neutrino mass differences and mixing angles through an unambiguously .",
    "thanks to available pressing technics the source fits inside a @xmath5115  cm - scale capsule , small enough to consider the cerium volume as a point - like source . for comparison",
    "the vertex reconstruction is @xmath5115 cm .",
    "@xmath43ce has a low production rate of high - energy @xmath39 rays ( @xmath52 1 mev ) from which the @xmath10 detector must be shielded to limit background events .",
    "backgrounds are of two types , those induced by the environment or detector , and those due to the source ( attenuated by a 20 cm tungsten shielding ) .",
    "eventually backgrounds are expected to be negligible thanks to the strong ibd signature .",
    "the logistic for transporting the source from the production site , pa mayak in russia , to the detector site is a major issue for such an experiment due to the necessary time required to certify the transport containers .",
    "this is a drawback for deploying quickly a 100 kci @xmath43ce source in kamland .",
    "since transportation to italy is easier the cesox experiment could take data as early as end of 2015 .      a new neutrino @xmath24 heavier than the three active neutrinos should leave an imprint in the @xmath34-spectrum of experiments measuring the absolute masses of active neutrinos , such as the forthcoming katrin experiment  @xcite .",
    "the detectors aims as measuring precisely the high energy tail of the tritium @xmath34-decay spectrum by combining an intense molecular tritium source with an integrating high - resolution spectrometer .",
    "the projected sensitivity of the experiment on the effective electron neutrino mass is 200 mev at 90% c.l .",
    "the detection principle is to search for a distortion at the high energy endpoint of the electron spectrum of tritium @xmath34-decay , since its shape is a priori very precisely understood .",
    "any shape distortion due to decays involving an heavier neutrino could sign the existence of a sterile neutrino state .",
    "as designed the katrin experiment can probe part of the current allowed region of the reactor antineutrino anomaly , especially for @xmath53 , with 3 years of data - taking  @xcite .",
    "first results are expected in 2016 .      over the last years a large experimental program",
    "is being prepared to search for sterile neutrinos using neutrino beams at cern or fermilab , or the spallation neutron source at oak ridge .",
    "we briefly review the various projects , sorting them by the processes creating the neutrinos .",
    "a huge statistics of @xmath10 from the @xmath34-decay of @xmath54he could be obtained through the development of a high - power cyclotron with low energy .",
    "the isodar project  @xcite proposes to place such a device underground in the kamioka mine to search for an oscillation pattern in the kamland 13-m diameter detector .",
    "this would be a disappearance experiment directly testing both the reactor and the gallium anomalies starting from a well known @xmath10 spectrum . in case of positive results",
    "it would have the ability to disentangle different oscillation models , potentially involving more than one sterile neutrino .      for 20 years the puzzling lsnd results carried out at lampf",
    "was never directly tested .",
    "this could reliably be achieved by locating a detector upstream to a spallation neutron source beam dump .",
    "this kind of facility has the advantage to produce a well - understood source of electron and muon neutrinos from @xmath55 and @xmath56 decays - at - rest .",
    "the oscsns project  @xcite propose to locate a 800-ton gadolinium - doped scintillator detector 60 m away from the spallation neutron source ( sns ) at the oak ridge national laboratory .",
    "the main channel would be the search of the appearance of @xmath10 , taking advantage of the low duty factor of sns to reduce cosmic induced backgrounds .",
    "projected sensitivity curves for proposed accelerator - based experiments , plotted against the global fits  @xcite . ]      to reliably test the lsnd and miniboone anomalies using pion decay in flight neutrinos one would need a setup with two identical detectors located at different baselines . the icarus / nessie project  @xcite propose to relocate the 600 tons icarus lar tpc at 1600 m away from a new neutrino beam line at cern , extracted from the sps .",
    "the near detector would consist of new lar tpc of 150 tons , to be built at 300 m away from the target .",
    "this experiment could address both @xmath8 and @xmath10 appearance and disappearance channels .",
    "it could be complemented by two muon spectrometers behind each tpc to enhance the ability to constrain @xmath9 dissaperance , a signal expected if the lsnd / miniboone anomalies are due to oscillation into sterile neutrino .",
    "a similar multi - baseline project is being proposed at fermilab in the booster neutrino beam line . the lar1 project  @xcite aims to build two lar tpc , a 40 ton and a 1 kton detector at 100 m and a 1 km for the target , respectively .",
    "we note that those two projects could be merged in a single experiment , by installing the icarus t600 lar tpc at fermilab  @xcite .",
    "ultimately precision physics of sterile neutrinos could be done by using a clean and well - understood beam of @xmath8 and @xmath11 produced by the decay of muons stored into a long storage ring with two straight arms pointing to two similar detectors .",
    "furthermore this facility could prototype a future neutrino factory . as a matter of fact",
    "such a neutrino beam could probe precisely both appearance and disappearance processes , the golden channel being the search for @xmath9 appearance from a muon free electron neutrino beam , that is impossible with in meson decay - in - flight beams .",
    "the nustorm project , based on existing technologies , has been proposed both at cern  @xcite and fermilab  @xcite .",
    "two magnetized iron detectors could be deployed at two different baselines to study the golden channel without polluted by wrong sign muons from the beam .",
    "the significance of each short baseline oscillation anomaly is moderate , but the concordance of their possible explanation with non - standard neutrino oscillation can not be neglected and calls for new data . the projected sensitivity of the experimental proposal discussed in this review are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for the reactor and neutrino generator proposals , and in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for the accelerator based projects .",
    "data used for these plots have been compiled by the authors of  @xcite from the collaborations , as well a from the comprehensive light sterile neutrino white paper  @xcite . from these summary plots",
    "we see that there is a broad range of sensitivites addressed by the various proposals in the appearance and dissapearance oscillation channels .",
    "it is likely that reactor and neutrino generator based experiments will provide first results since they require less funding and resources .",
    "the proposed experiments have the potential to test neutrino oscillation transitions with mass - squared difference @xmath57  ev@xmath58 and mixing angle such that @xmath59 ( see in fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "however if sterile neutrino oscillations would be confirmed by these first data , then it would be mandatory to study this new physics with a vast accelerator - based experimental program , leading to more precise results and accessing to all possible appearance channels , as can bee seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the observation of neutrino oscillations in at least two independent detectors employing different physics channels , detection methods , and neutrino targets would be a necessary indication to sign the existence of sterile neutrinos .",
    "first results on the clarification of the short baseline neutrino oscillation anomalies might come as early as 2015 .",
    "the situation should be definitively clarified by 2020 , with potentially surprises that could lead to major breakthroughs in particle physics , astrophysics , and cosmology .",
