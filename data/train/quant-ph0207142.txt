    "suppose we are given a light pulse in one of two possible coherent states @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 real and positive ) and we are to guess which one of the two we have in our possession .",
    "the minimum error probability is @xcite @xmath3 a measurement that achieves this minimum error probability using linear optics , photon counters and feedback , but which is hard to implement , was given by dolinar in @xcite .",
    "an alternative optimum scheme , not requiring feedback , but still complicated , was considered in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . a much simpler `` near - optimum '' scheme using linear optics , photon counters but no feedback was presented by kennedy in @xcite , which achieves an error probability of @xmath4 this scheme is near optimal in the sense that in the limit of @xmath5 ( the relevant limit for _ classical _ communication ) @xmath6 .",
    "the standard technique of homodyne detection @xcite would lead to an error probability ( for more details , see below ) @xmath7 which is clearly inferior to the kennedy measurement for large amplitudes , but which is superior ( although not optimal ) for small amplitudes @xmath2 , which is the relevant limit for _ quantum _ communication .",
    "in particular , experimental implementations of quantum key distribution protocols ( see for example @xcite ) , rely on the use of weak laser pulses with average numbers of photons of @xmath8 with the express goal of producing nonorthogonal and hence not perfectly distinguishable quantum states .",
    "now lasers actually do not produce coherent states but mixtures of coherent states described by density matrices of the form@xcite @xmath9 the `` phase '' of a laser field can only be defined relative to another laser beam .",
    "the problem of distinguishing two phases @xmath10 and @xmath11 of a faint laser beam with amplitude @xmath2 in the presence of a reference pulse with amplitude @xmath12 can be formulated as distinguishing two mixed states @xmath13 and @xmath14 given by@xcite @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "the detection schemes mentioned above assume that an absolute phase standard is present and indeed explicitly require an in principle infinite amount of auxiliary light with a known phase ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) .",
    "but suppose one has at one s disposal only a phase reference pulse of finite amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "how well can one distinguish the two phases given this restricted resource ?",
    "this problem shows up in qkd where phase is used to encode information .",
    "in such a case a reference pulse is sent along with the signal pulse , typically over the same fiber .",
    "but the reference pulse may not be chosen arbitrarily strong as some of that light may cross over to and thus contaminate the signal .",
    "interestingly , even when polarization is the degree of freedom encoding the information the light pulses are properly described by states of the form ( [ ba ] ) with @xmath18 @xcite .    in section [ lo ]",
    "we consider simple measurements that require linear optics and photon counters but no feedback .",
    "we generalize kennedy s measurement and homodyne detection to setups with finite reference pulses .",
    "we also construct a whole class of measurements that includes those two measurements and other improved measurements . in section [ opt ]",
    "we consider the optimum measurement for quantum state discrimination of the states ( [ ba ] ) .",
    "kennedy s measurement combines the unknown state @xmath19 on a beamsplitter with a reference beam with amplitude @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the absolute values of the reflection and transmission coefficients of the beamsplitter . in the limit",
    "@xmath23 one of the output ports will either have a coherent state of amplitude @xmath24 or the vacuum , depending on the phase of the unknown coherent state ( the other output is useless ) .",
    "if a photon is detected in that port , one is certain to have the state @xmath1 , if no photon is registered one guesses that the unknown state is @xmath0 .",
    "the probability of a wrong guess is then given by ( [ ken ] ) .",
    "the limit of @xmath23 , however , implies @xmath17 .",
    "given a finite amount of light , we can generalize the kennedy measurement by requiring that in the useful output port the amplitudes cancel if the state is @xmath0 .",
    "this requires we keep the relation @xmath20 .",
    "one output port will then either contain the vacuum or a coherent state with amplitude @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding error probability is then @xmath26 for consistency the reflection coefficient for finite @xmath12 has to be chosen as @xmath27 the error probability reduces to ( [ ken ] ) in the limit @xmath17 and reduces to 1/2 for @xmath28 , as it should .",
    "viewed as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath12 , ( [ ken2 ] ) is symmetric in its arguments because the measurement procedure is symmetric in the signal and reference states : the phase of one is defined only relative to the other . for the small values of @xmath2 we are interested in , all error probabilities are close to 1/2 .",
    "a better measure to compare different probabilities may be generically defined as @xmath29 in terms of the corresponding error probability .",
    "@xmath30 may be interpreted as a measure of distinguishability and ranges between 0 for identical states and 1 for orthogonal states .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ pken1 ] for plots of both the error probabilities and the corresponding measure of distinguishability for the ( generalized ) kennedy measurement .",
    "if we consider signal states with @xmath31 the figure shows that 10 photons in the reference pulse are sufficient to be within 1% of the best achievable ( for either measure ) for the kennedy measurement , and even just 1 photon brings one within 7% .      in a homodyne detection scheme one",
    "splits the unknown coherent state on a 50/50 beamsplitter with a reference light beam of amplitude @xmath12 and measures the difference in photon number between the two output ports .",
    "the two output modes are in coherent states with amplitudes @xmath32 . in the limit of @xmath17",
    "the difference between the expected photon numbers @xmath33 becomes linear in @xmath2 and thus homodyne detection directly measures the amplitude . for finite @xmath12",
    "we use a similar strategy : we guess that the output port with the larger number of detected photons is associated with an amplitude @xmath34 ( in the case of an equal number of photons we make a random guess ) .",
    "the probability to detect @xmath35 photons in a coherent state with amplitude @xmath36 is @xmath37 in terms of the expected number of photons @xmath38 .",
    "our procedure gives a wrong result if the larger coherent state is found to contain fewer photons than the smaller one .",
    "moreover , if we find an equal number of photons we will have to make a random guess . the total error probability , therefore , is @xmath39 just as for the generalized kennedy measurement , this probability function is symmetric in @xmath2 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is plotted in fig .",
    "[ phom1 ] .    just as for the kennedy measurement",
    "a reference pulse containing 10 photons is sufficient to reach a distinguishability of 99% of the best a homodyne measurement can achieve , while a reference pulse with just 1 photon on average brings one to within about 15% at @xmath31 .",
    "for completeness we note that in the limit @xmath17 both probability distributions @xmath40 and @xmath41 approach gaussian distributions . that is , defining continuous variables @xmath42 we get @xmath43 with the variable @xmath44 ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "the probability ( [ pd ] ) reduces then to @xmath47 which confirms ( [ hom ] ) .",
    "the generalized kennedy and homodyne measurements are special cases of a whole class of similarly straightforward measurements",
    ". we can take _ any _ beamsplitter with arbitrary transmission and reflection coefficients whose absolute values @xmath48 can be parametrized without loss of generality as @xmath49 the expected numbers of photons in the two output ports , @xmath50 respectively , depend on the phase of the unknown state .",
    "if we found @xmath35 photons in the first detector , @xmath51 in the second , we calculate the joint probabilities @xmath52 where @xmath53 if @xmath54 we guess that we had the state @xmath0 , if @xmath55 we guess that we had the state @xmath1 , if the two probabilities happen to be equal we make a random guess .",
    "this corresponds to maximizing the _ conditional _ probabilities for the unknown state to be @xmath19 given @xmath35 and @xmath51 clicks in the respective photodetectors .",
    "the error probability is @xmath56 where the first summation runs over all pairs @xmath57 such that @xmath58 , etcetera .",
    "the generalized homodyne and kennedy measurements are special cases of this general measurement for angles @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    in figures",
    "[ phi1 ] and [ phi10 ] we plot the error probability @xmath61 as a function of @xmath62 for the case of @xmath31 and @xmath63 and 10 , respectively . for this small value of @xmath2 homodyne detection",
    "is better than kennedy s measurement and for certain values of @xmath62 the error probability @xmath61 is even smaller .    for @xmath64 the probability distributions again approach gaussian distribution functions in the limit @xmath17 .",
    "remarkably , @xmath61 approaches @xmath65 for any nonzero @xmath62 in that same limit , but the limit is not uniform .",
    "although an arbitrary beamsplitter with nonzero reflection and transmission coefficients does not improve upon standard homodyne detection in the limit @xmath66 , for finite values of @xmath12 improvement is in fact possible as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phi10 ] .",
    "the measurements considered in the previous section were chosen for their simplicity but do not allow one to achieve the minimum error probability . for the case of pure coherent states",
    "the minimum error probability was given in ( [ min ] ) , its generalization to mixed states is@xcite @xmath67 which gives the minimum error probability for distinguishing two mixed states that are _ a priori _ equally likely .",
    "this expression reduces to ( [ min ] ) for @xmath17 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath68 can be written in the number - state basis as @xmath69 here we are mostly interested in the limit of small @xmath2 .",
    "the lowest - order term in an expansion in powers of @xmath2 of the density matrix @xmath68 is linear in @xmath2 and contains two terms : @xmath70 where @xmath71 an integer .",
    "the optimum measurement achieving the minimum error probability is then a projective measurement onto the eigenstates ( [ eig ] ) .",
    "it is an open question how this measurement can be implemented . in the limit that @xmath72",
    "the optimum measurement is equivalent to the generalized kennedy and homodyne detection schemes .",
    "we can now evaluate @xmath73 as @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ trrho ] we plot the ratio @xmath75 as a function of @xmath76 , where @xmath77 corresponds to the limit of @xmath17 and @xmath2 small .",
    "we considered the question how well one can distinguish two faint laser pulses with opposite phases as a function of the intensity of the phase reference pulse .",
    "it turns out that even with a reference pulse containing just 1 photon on average one does reasonably well .",
    "for example , take a signal state that possesses 0.1 photons on average .",
    "then , depending on what measurement one considers , the distinguishability is somewhere between 75% and 95% of the best achievable with an infinite reference pulse .",
    "we considered generalizations of kennedy s measurement and homodyne detection , and the optimum measurement .",
