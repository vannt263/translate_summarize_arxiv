    "since the pioneering work by @xcite , the problems of high mass - to - light ratios of galaxy clusters and of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies have been faced by asking for huge amounts of unseen matter in the framework of newtonian theory of gravity .",
    "it is interesting to stress the fact that zwicky addressed such an issue dealing with _ missing matter _ and not with _",
    "dark matter_.    later on , several versions of the the cold dark matter model ( cdm ) have been built starting from the assumption that a large amount of non - baryonic matter ( i.e. matter non - interacting with the electromagnetic radiation ) could account for the observations in the framework of the standard newtonian dynamics .",
    "besides , by adding a further ingredient , the cosmological constant @xmath2 @xcite , such a model ( now @xmath2cdm ) has become the new cosmological paradigm usually called the _ concordance model_.    in fact , high quality data coming from the measurements of cluster properties as the mass , the correlation function and the evolution with redshift of their abundance @xcite , the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae @xcite , the optical surveys of large scale structure @xcite , the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , the cosmic shear measured from weak lensing surveys @xcite and the lyman-@xmath3 forest absorption @xcite are evidences toward a spatially flat universe with a subcritical matter content and undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion . interpreting all this information in a self - consistent model is the main task of modern cosmology and @xmath2cdm model provides a good fit to the most of the data @xcite giving a reliable snapshot of the today observed universe",
    ".    nevertheless , it is affected by serious theoretical shortcomings that have motivated the search for alternative candidates generically referred to as _ dark energy _ or _",
    "quintessence_. such models range from scalar fields rolling down self interaction potentials to phantom fields , from phenomenological unified models of dark energy and dark matter to alternative gravity theories @xcite .",
    "essentially , dark energy ( or any alternative component ) has to act as a negative pressure fluid which gives rise to an overall acceleration of the hubble fluid . despite of the clear mechanisms generating the observed cosmological dynamics , the nature and the fundamental properties of dark energy remain essentially unknown notwithstanding the great theoretical efforts made up to now .",
    "the situation for dark matter is similar : its clustering and distribution properties are fairly well known at every scale but its nature is unknown , up to now , at a fundamental level .    on the other hand ,",
    "the need of unknown components as dark energy and dark matter could be considered nothing else but as a signal of the breakdown of einstein general relativity at astrophysical ( galactic and extragalactic ) and cosmological scales .    in this context ,",
    "extended theories of gravity could be , in principle , an interesting alternative to explain cosmic acceleration without any dark energy and large scale structure without any dark matter . in their simplest version , the ricci curvature scalar @xmath4 , linear in the hilbert - einstein action ,",
    "could be replaced by a generic function @xmath0 whose true form could be `` reconstructed '' by the data .",
    "in fact , there is no a priori reason to consider the gravitational lagrangian linear in the ricci scalar while observations and experiments could contribute to define and constrain the `` true '' theory of gravity . for a discussion on this topic , see @xcite .    in a cosmological framework ,",
    "such an approach lead to modified friedmann equations that can be formally written in the usual form by defining an effective _ curvature fluid _ giving rise to a negative pressure which drives the cosmic acceleration @xcite . also referred to as @xmath0 theories , this approach is recently extensively studied both from the theoretical and the observational point of view ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , this same approach has been also proposed , in early cosmology , as a mechanism giving rise to an inflationary era without the need of any inflaton field @xcite .",
    "all this amount of work has been , essentially , concentrated on the cosmological applications and have convincingly demonstrated that extended theories of gravity ( in particular @xmath0 gravity ) are indeed able to explain the cosmic speed up and fairly fit the available data - sets and , hence , represents a viable alternative to the dark energy models @xcite .",
    "changing the gravity sector could have consequences not only at cosmological scales , but also at the galactic and cluster scales so that it is mandatory to investigate the low energy limit of such theories .",
    "a strong debate is open with different results arguing in favor @xcite or against @xcite such models .",
    "it is worth noting that , as a general result , higher order theories of gravity cause the gravitational potential to deviate from its newtonian @xmath5 scaling @xcite even if such deviations may be vanishing .    in @xcite , the newtonian limit of power law @xmath6 theories has been investigated , assuming that the metric in the low energy limit ( @xmath7 ) may be taken as schwarzschild - like .",
    "it turns out that a power law term @xmath8 has to be added to the newtonian @xmath5 term in order to get the correct gravitational potential . while the parameter @xmath9 may be expressed analytically as a function of the slope @xmath10 of the @xmath0 theory , @xmath11 sets the scale where the correction term starts being significant .",
    "a particular range of values of @xmath10 has been investigated so that the corrective term is an increasing function of the radius @xmath12 thus causing an increase of the rotation curve with respect to the newtonian one and offering the possibility to fit the galaxy rotation curves without the need of further dark matter components .",
    "a set of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies with extended and well measured rotation curves has been considered @xcite .",
    "these systems are supposed to be dark matter dominated , and successfully fitting data without dark matter is a strong evidence in favor of the approach ( see also @xcite for an independent analysis using another sample of galaxies ) . combined with the hints coming from the cosmological applications , one should have , in principle , the possibility to address both the dark energy and dark matter problems resorting to the same well motivated fundamental theory @xcite . nevertheless , the simple power law @xmath0 gravity is nothing else but a toy - model which fail if one tries to achieve a comprehensive model for all the cosmological dynamics , ranging from the early universe , to the large scale structure up to the late accelerated era @xcite .",
    "a fundamental issue is related to clusters and superclusters of galaxies .",
    "such structures , essentially , rule the large scale structure , and are the intermediate step between galaxies and cosmology . as the galaxies , they appear dark - matter dominated but the distribution of dark matter component seems clustered and organized in a very different way with respect to galaxies .",
    "it seems that dark matter is ruled by the scale and also its fundamental nature could depend on the scale . for a comprehensive review",
    "see @xcite .    in the philosophy of extended theories of gravity ,",
    "the issue is now to reconstruct the mass profile of clusters _ without _ dark matter , i.e. to find out corrections to the newton potential producing the same dynamics as dark matter but starting from a well motivated theory .",
    "this is the goal of this paper .",
    "as we will see , the problem is very different with respect to that of galaxies and we need different corrections to the gravitational potential in order to consistently fit the cluster mass profiles .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ext_theories ] , also referring to other results , we discuss the weak field limit of @xmath0-gravity showing that an @xmath0 theory is , in principle , quite fair to address the cluster problem @xcite . in section  [ sec : ext_systems ] , starting from the corrected potential previously derived for a point - like masses , we generalize the results to extended spherically symmetric systems as required for well shaped cluster models of the bautz and morgan classification @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : mass_profiles ] is devoted to the description of the general properties of galaxy clusters . in section  [ sec : sample ] , the sample of galaxy clusters which we are going to fit is discussed in details . results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , while section  [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to the discussion and the conclusions .",

    "we simply consider the system composed by many infinitesimal mass elements @xmath60 each one contributing with a point - like gravitational potential .",
    "then , summing up all terms , namely integrating them on a spherical volume , we obtain a suitable potential .",
    "specifically , we have to solve the integral : @xmath61 the point - like potential ( [ gravpot1])can be split in two terms .",

    "we underline a fundamental difference between such a term and the newtonian one : while in the latter , the matter outside the spherical shell of radius @xmath12 does not contribute to the potential , in the former , external matter takes part to the integration procedure . for this reason we split the corrective potential in two terms :    * if @xmath68 : @xmath69 * if @xmath70 : @xmath71    the total potential of the spherical mass distribution will be @xmath72",
    "as we will show below , for our purpose , we need the gravitational potential derivative with respect to the variable @xmath12 ; the two derivatives may not be evaluated analytically so we estimate them numerically , once we have given an expression for the _ total _ mass density @xmath73 . while the newtonian term gives the simple expression : @xmath74 the internal and external derivatives of the corrective potential terms are more involved .",
    "we do not give them explicitly for sake of brevity , but they are integral - functions of the form @xmath75 from which one has : @xmath76 such an expression is numerically derived once the integration extremes are given . a general consideration",
    "is in order at this point .",
    "clearly , the gauss theorem holds only for the newtonian part since , for this term , the force law scales as @xmath77 . for the total potential ( [ gravpot1 ] )",
    ", it does not hold anymore due to the correction . from a physical point of view , this is not a problem because the full conservation laws are determined , for @xmath0-gravity , by the contracted bianchi identities which assure the self - consistency . for a detailed discussion , see @xcite .",
    "clusters of galaxies are generally considered self - bound gravitational systems with spherical symmetry and in hydrostatic equilibrium if virialized . the last two hypothesis",

    "there are two main independent explanations that could justify this trend : limits due to a break in the state of hydrostatic equilibrium or limits in the series expansion of the @xmath0-models .    if the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium is not correct , then we are in a regime where the fundamental relations eqs .",
    "( [ boltzmann equation])-  ( [ eq : boltzmann potential ] ) , are not working .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the central ( 70 kpc ) region of most clusters is strongly affected by radiative cooling and thus its physical properties can not directly be related to the depth of the cluster potential well .",
    "this means that , in this region , the gas is not in hydrostatic equilibrium but in a multi - phase state . in this case , the gas temperature can not be used as a good standard tracer .",
    "we have also to consider another limit of our modelling : the requirement that the @xmath0-function is taylor expandable . the corrected gravitational potential which we have considered is derived in the weak field limit , which means @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the background value of the curvature .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , the approach does not work ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of this point ) .",
    "considering that @xmath193 has the dimension of @xmath194 this condition defines the _ length scale _ where our series approximation can work .",
    "in other words , this indicates the limit in which the model can be compared with data .    for the considered sample ,",
    "the fit of the parameters @xmath152 and @xmath59 , spans the length range @xmath195 kpc ( except for the richest clusters ) .",
    "it is evident that every galaxy cluster has a _ proper _ gravitational length scale .",
    "it is worth noticing that a similar situation , but at completely different scales , has been found out for low surface brightness galaxies modelled by @xmath0-gravity @xcite .    considering the data at our disposal and the analysis which we have performed",
    ", it is not possible to quantify exactly the quantitative amount of these two different phenomena ( i.e. the radiative cooling and the validity of the weak field limit ) .",
    "however , they are not mutually exclusive but should be considered in details in view of a more refined modelling .",
    "similar issues are present also in @xcite : they use the the metric - skew - tensor - gravity ( mstg ) as a generalization of the einstein general relativity and derive the gas mass profile of a sample of clusters with gas being the only baryonic component of the clusters .",
    "they consider some clusters included in our sample ( in particular , a133 , a262 , a478 , a1413 , a1795 , a2029 , mkw4 ) and they find the same different trend for @xmath196 kpc , even if with a different behavior with respect to us : our model gives lower values than x - ray gas mass data while their model gives higher values with respect to x - ray gas mass data .",
    "this stresses the need for a more accurate modelling of the gravitational potential .    :",
    "predictions on the behavior of @xmath152 .",
    "the horizontal black bold line indicates the newtonian - limit , @xmath197 which we expect to be realized on scales comparable with solar system .",
    "vertical lines indicate typical approximated values of matter density ( without dark matter ) for different gravitational structures : universe ( large dashed ) with critical density @xmath198 @xmath199 ; galaxy clusters ( short dashed ) with @xmath200 @xmath199 ; galaxies ( dot - dashed ) with @xmath201 @xmath199 ; sun ( dotted ) with @xmath202 @xmath199 .",
    "arrows and boxes show the predicted trend for @xmath152.,width=317 ]    however , our goal is to show that potential ( [ gravpot1 ] ) is suitable to fit the mass profile of galaxy clusters and that it comes from a self - consistent theory .    in general , it can be shown that the weak field limit of extended theories of gravity has yukawa - like corrections @xcite .",
    "specifically , given theory of gravity of order @xmath203 , the yukawa corrections to the newtonian potential are @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this means that if the effective lagrangian of the theory is @xmath204 we have @xmath205\\,.\\ ] ] standard general relativity , where yukawa corrections are not present , is recovered for @xmath206 ( second order theory ) while the @xmath0-gravity is obtained for @xmath207 ( fourth - order theory ) .",
    "any @xmath208 operator introduces two further derivation orders in the field equations .",
    "this kind of lagrangian comes out when quantum field theory is formulated on curved spacetime @xcite . in the series ( [ yukawa ] ) ,",
    "@xmath209 is the value of the gravitational constant considered at infinity , @xmath210 is the interaction length of the @xmath88-th component of the non - newtonian corrections .",
    "the amplitude @xmath211 of each component is normalized to the standard newtonian term ; the sign of @xmath211 tells us if the corrections are attractive or repulsive ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "moreover , the variation of the gravitational coupling is involved . in our case",
    ", we are taking into account only the first term of the series .",
    "it is the the leading term .",
    "let us rewrite ( [ gravpot1 ] ) as    @xmath212\\,.\\ ] ]    the effect of non - newtonian term can be parameterized by @xmath213 which could be a useful parameterisation which respect to our previous @xmath214 or @xmath215 with @xmath216 . for large distances , where @xmath217 , the exponential term vanishes and the gravitational coupling is @xmath209 .",
    "if @xmath218 , the exponential becomes 1 and , by differentiating eq.([yukawa1 ] ) and comparing with the gravitational force measured in laboratory , we get    @xmath219 \\simeq g(1+\\alpha_1)\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath220 g@xmath221@xmath222s@xmath223 is the usual newton constant measured by cavendish - like experiments .",
    "of course , @xmath209 and @xmath224 coincide in the standard newtonian gravity .",
    "it is worth noticing that , asymptotically , the inverse square law holds but the measured coupling constant differs by a factor @xmath225 . in general , any correction introduces a characteristic length that acts at a certain scale for the self - gravitating systems as in the case of galaxy cluster which we are examining here .",
    "the range of @xmath210 of the @xmath88th - component of non - newtonian force can be identified with the mass @xmath226 of a pseudo - particle whose effective compton s length can be defined as    @xmath227    the interpretation of this fact is that , in the weak energy limit , fundamental theories which attempt to unify gravity with the other forces introduce , in addition to the massless graviton , particles _ with mass _ which also carry the gravitational interaction @xcite .",
    "see , in particular , @xcite for @xmath0-gravity .",
    "these masses are related to effective length scales which can be parameterized as    @xmath228    there have been several attempts to experimentally constrain @xmath210 and @xmath211 ( and then @xmath226 ) by experiments on scales in the range @xmath229 , using different techniques @xcite . in this case , the expected masses of particles which should carry the additional gravitational force are in the range @xmath230 . the general outcome of these experiments , even retaining only the term @xmath231 , is that _ geophysical window _ between the laboratory and the astronomical scales has to be taken into account . in fact",
    ", the range    @xmath232    is not excluded at all in this window .",
    "an interesting suggestion has been given by fujii @xcite , which proposed that the exponential deviation from the newtonian standard potential could arise from the microscopic interaction which couples the nuclear isospin and the baryon number .",
    "the astrophysical counterparts of these non - newtonian corrections seemed ruled out till some years ago due to the fact that experimental tests of general relativity seemed to predict the newtonian potential in the weak energy limit ,  inside \" the solar system . however , as it has been shown , several alternative theories seem to evade the solar system constraints ( see @xcite and the reference therein for recent results ) and , furthermore , indications of an anomalous , long  range acceleration revealed from the data analysis of pioneer 10/11 , galileo , and ulysses spacecrafts ( which are now almost outside the solar system ) makes these yukawa  like corrections come again into play @xcite .",
    "besides , it is possible to reproduce phenomenologically the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies considering the values    @xmath233    the main hypothesis of this approach is that the additional gravitational interaction is carried by some ultra - soft boson whose range of mass is @xmath234ev . the action of this boson becomes efficient at galactic scales without the request of enormous amounts of dark matter to stabilize the systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to use a combination of two exponential correction terms and give a detailed explanation of the kinematics of galaxies and galaxy clusters , again without dark matter model @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that both the spacecrafts measurements and galactic rotation curves indications come from  outside \" the usual solar system boundaries used up to now to test general relativity .",
    "however , the above results _ do not come _ from any fundamental theory to explain the outcome of yukawa corrections . in their contexts ,",
    "these terms are phenomenological .",
    "another important remark in this direction deserves the fact that some authors @xcite interpret also the experiments on cosmic microwave background like the experiment boomerang and wmap @xcite in the framework of _ modified newtonian dynamics _ again without invoking any dark matter model .    all these facts point towards the line of thinking that also corrections to the standard gravity have to be seriously taken into account beside dark matter searches .",
    "in our case , the parameters @xmath235 , which determine the gravitational correction and the gravitational coupling , come out `` directly '' from a field theory with the only requirement that the effective action of gravity could be more general than the hilbert - einstein theory @xmath18 .",
    "this main hypothesis comes from fundamental physics motivations due to the fact that any unification scheme or quantum field theory on curved space have to take into account higher order terms in curvature invariants @xcite .",
    "besides , several recent results point out that such corrections have a main role also at astrophysical and cosmological scales . for a detailed discussion ,",
    "see @xcite .    with this philosophy in mind ,",
    "we have plotted the trend of @xmath152 as a function of the density in fig.[fig : plots_finali1 ] .",
    "as one can see , its values are strongly constrained in a narrow region of the parameter space , so that @xmath152 can be considered a `` tracer '' for the size of gravitational structures . the value of @xmath152 range between @xmath236 for larger clusters and @xmath237 for poorer structures ( i.e. galaxy groups like mkw4 and rxj1159 ) .",
    "we expect a particular trend when applying the model to different gravitational structures . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plots_finali1 ] , we give characteristic values of density which range from the biggest structure , the observed universe ( large dashed vertical line ) , to the smallest one , the sun ( vertical dotted line ) , through intermediate steps like clusters ( vertical short dashed line ) and galaxies ( vertical dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the bold black horizontal line represents the newtonian limit @xmath238 and the boxes indicate the possible values of @xmath152 that we obtain by applying our theoretical model to different structures .",
    "similar considerations hold also for the characteristic gravitational length @xmath58 directly related to both @xmath152 and @xmath59 .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 shows a very large range of variation @xmath239 with respect to the density ( and the mass ) of the clusters .",
    "the value of @xmath58 changes with the sizes of gravitational structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : propphysvsl ] ) , so it can be considered , beside the schwarzschild radius , a sort of additional gravitational radius .",
    "particular care must be taken when considering abell  2390 , which shows large cavities in the x - ray surface brightness distribution , and whose central region , highly asymmetric , is not expected to be in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "all results at small and medium radii for this cluster could hence be strongly biased by these effects  @xcite ; the same will hold for the resulting exceptionally high value of @xmath58 .",
    "[ fig : propphysvsl ] shows how observational properties of the cluster , which well characterize its gravitational potential ( such as the average temperature and the total cluster mass within r@xmath110 , plotted in the left and right panel , respectively ) , well correlate with the characteristic gravitational length @xmath58 .    for clusters , we can define a gas - density - weighted and a gas - mass - weighted mean , both depending on the series parameters @xmath235 .",
    "we have : @xmath240 it is straightforward to note the correlation with the sizes of the cluster cd - dominated - central region and the `` gravitational '' interaction length of the whole cluster .",
    "in other words , the parameters @xmath235 , directly related to the first and second derivative of a given analytic @xmath0-model determine the characteristic sizes of the self gravitating structures .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the possibility that the high observational mass - to - light ratio of galaxy clusters could be addressed by @xmath0- gravity without assuming huge amounts of dark matter .",
    "we point out that this proposal comes out from the fact that , up to now , no definitive candidate for dark - matter has been observed at fundamental level and then alternative solutions to the problem should be viable .",
    "furthermore , several results in @xmath0-gravity seem to confirm that valid alternatives to @xmath2cdm can be achieved in cosmology .",
    "besides , as discussed in the introduction , the rotation curves of spiral galaxies can be explained in the weak field limit of @xmath0-gravity .",
    "results of our analysis go in this direction .",
    "we have chosen a sample of relaxed galaxy clusters for which accurate spectroscopic temperature measurements and gas mass profiles are available .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , and considered the sample at our disposal , every cluster has been modelled as a self bound gravitational system with spherical symmetry and in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the mass distribution has been described by a corrected gravitational potential obtained from a generic analytic @xmath0-theory .",
    "in fact , as soon as @xmath241 , yukawa - like exponential corrections emerge in the weak field limit while the standard newtonian potential is recovered only for @xmath18 , the hilbert - einstein theory .    our goal has been to analyze if the dark - matter content of clusters can be addressed by these correction potential terms . as discussed in detail in the previous section and",
    "how it is possible to see by a rapid inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig : plot_fin_1]-  [ fig : plot_fin_12 ] , all the clusters of the sample are consistent with the proposed model at @xmath242 confidence level .",
    "this shows , at least _",
    "qualitatively _ , that the high mass - to - light ratio of clusters can be explained by using a modified gravitational potential .",
    "the good agreement is achieved on distance scales starting from @xmath243 kpc up to @xmath244 kpc .",
    "the differences observed at smaller scales can be ascribed to non - gravitational phenomena , such as cooling flows , or to the fact that the gas mass is not a good tracer at this scales .",
    "the remarkable result is that we have obtained a consistent agreement with data only using the corrected gravitational potential in a large range of radii . in order to put in evidence this trend ,",
    "we have plotted the baryonic mass vs radii considering , for each cluster , the scale where the trend is clearly evident .    in our knowledge ,",
    "the fact that @xmath0-gravity could work at these scales has been only supposed but never achieved by a direct fitting with data ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "starting from the series coefficients @xmath152 and @xmath59 , it is possible to state that , at cluster scales , two characteristic sizes emerge from the weak field limit of the theory .",
    "however , at smaller scales , e.g. solar system scales , standard newtonian gravity has to be dominant in agreement with observations .    in conclusion ,",
    "if our considerations are right , gravitational interaction depends on the scale and the _ infrared limit _ is led by the series coefficient of the considered effective gravitational lagrangian . roughly speaking",
    ", we expect that starting from cluster scale to galaxy scale , and then down to smaller scales as solar system or earth , the terms of the series lead the clustering of self - gravitating systems beside other non - gravitational phenomena . in our case , the newtonian limit is recovered for @xmath197 and @xmath245 at small scales and for @xmath246 at large scales . in the first case ,",
    "the gravitational coupling has to be redifined , in the second @xmath247 . in these limits ,",
    "the linear ricci term is dominant in the gravitational lagrangian and the newtonian gravity is restored @xcite . reversing the argument",
    ", this could be the starting point to achieve a theory capable of explaining the strong segregation in masses and sizes of gravitationally - bound systems .",

    "<S> we consider the possibility that masses and gravitational potentials of galaxy cluster , estimated at x - ray wavelengths , could be explained without assuming huge amounts of dark matter , but in the context of @xmath0-gravity . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we take into account the weak field limit of such theories and show that the corrected gravitational potential allows to estimate the total mass of a sample of @xmath1 clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> results show that such a gravitational potential provides a fair fit to the mass of visible matter ( i.e. gas + stars ) estimated by x - ray observations , without the need of additional dark matter while the size of the clusters , as already observed at different scale for galaxies , strictly depends on the interaction lengths of the corrections to the newtonian potential .    </S>",
