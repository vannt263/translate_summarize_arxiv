    "since the pioneering work of cumings and zetttl @xcite carbon nanotube ( cnt ) based oscillators have became object of many studies .",
    "cumings and zettl demonstrated the controlled and reversible telescopic extension of multiwalled cnts , thus realizing ultra low - friction nanoscale linear bearings .",
    "zheng and collaborators @xcite have proposed that this phenomenon could be exploited to built nano - oscillators in the frequency range of gigahertz .",
    "_ @xcite carried out molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations and concluded that sustained oscillations are possible when the radii difference between inner and outer oscillator moving parts are about @xmath0 3.4  .",
    "frequencies as high as 40 ghz are possible and even clear chaotic signatures were observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the behavior of oscillator damping via md and they showed that the damping depends on the inverse of the cnt length , which is in good agreement with the prediction of analytical models @xcite .",
    "they also showed @xcite that the frequencies in the gigahertz decrease as the length of the tubes increases .",
    "@xcite studied the oscillator energy dissipation energy mechanism , also using md simulations , and they demonstrated the importance of the overlap length of double cnts and the mechanical deformation of the outmost cnt to this mechanism . in spite of the large amount of investigation of cnt based oscillators some aspects remain not clearly understood , especially with relation to friction mechanisms @xcite .",
    "in this sense it is important to study other related systems such as oscillators made of different materials and also atoms and molecules oscillating inside the tubes .",
    "only very few studies have been reported along these lines , such as oscillators composed of boron nitride nanotubes ( bnnts ) @xcite , bnnts in association with cnt ones @xcite , @xmath1 molecules @xcite and rare - gas atoms @xcite inside cnts .",
    "the choice for using rare - gas atoms is associated with their inert nature which prevents chemical reactions with the tubes .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that sustained oscillations are possible for a large range of energy variations and also , in some circunstantes , the tube chirality is important to determine the oscillatory patterns . however , there are conflicting data for the behavior of the oscillator frequency decaying with the tube diameter .",
    "further studies are necessary to better understand these aspects . in the present work we report extensive fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations for the study of ne atoms oscillating inside ( 5,5)cnts and ( 5,5)bnnts , to our knowledge",
    "this is the first study of rare - gas atoms oscillating inside bnnts .",
    "we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations using the universal force field uff  @xcite as implemented in the _ cerius2 _",
    "package  @xcite .",
    "this force field includes van der waals , bond stretch , bond angle bend , inversion , torsion and rotation terms .",
    "it has been used with success in the study of dynamical properties of carbon based nanostructures @xcite .",
    "initially , we perform a molecular mechanics energy minimization to optimize the geometry of each isolated nanotube . then , a * ne * atom is placed about 1 from the nanotube ends and the dynamical simulations are carried out .",
    "we have used in all cases a microcanonical ensemble ( nve ) .",
    "we have used an integration _",
    "step _ of 1 fs . the md simulations were performed in the following temperatures ( in kelvins ) : 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 , 160 , 240 , and 300 . in order to thermically equilibrate the system a running of 200 ps",
    "is initially performed .",
    "after the equilibration a running of 50 ps is carried out and the data trajectory ( positions and velocities ) saved .",
    "from the trajectory data we perform a fast fourier transform(fft ) to obtain the oscillatory frequencies .",
    "we have considered cnt and bnnt with ( 5,5 ) chirality type .",
    "two different lengths were considered ( 25  and 50  in order to investigate the frequency dependence with the length of the tubes .",
    "the choice of ( 5,5 ) nanotubes is due to that they have the minimum diameter that allows the * ne * atom encapsulation and also this particular chirality implies fewer atoms in the unit cell which reduces substantially the computational cost of the simulations .",
    "in table [ t.necnt ] we show the calculated oscillation frequencies for a * ne * atom inside a cnt , for temperatures from 5k up to 240k . for 300k",
    "we observed that the * ne * atom is not encapsulated . in our simulations all the atoms of the nanotube are free to vibrate and with the increase of temperature the amplitude of the vibrations of the atoms at the end of tube increase .",
    "mainly due to the van der walls interactions a dynamical barrier is created which prevents the * ne * atom encapsulation . as we can see from the table stable frequencies are possible for a large range of temperatures , which could be an interesting aspect to be exploited in possible applications , such as clocks .",
    "for the 25  cnt from 5 up to 240 k the frequencies are 136.71 and then they drop to 117.18 ghz . for the longer tube ( 50  ) , as expected , this occurs at lower temperature ( 160 k ) , the frequencies drops from 78.12 to 58.59 ghz .",
    "this sustained oscillatory regime is better visualized in figs . 1 and 2",
    ". these results are consistent with the ones obtained by zeng _",
    "@xcite in spite of their different protocol simulations .",
    "they used an impulse dynamics that can be mapped into our nve simulations varying the initial conditions with respect to the temperature of simulations .",
    ".calculated frequencies ( * ghz * ) for ne@cnt(5,5 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     again , as observed for the cnt case , sustained oscillatory regimes are possible for a large range of temperatures , and at almost the same frequency values .",
    "the only major differences are at what temperature we observe dropping frequency occurring values and the absence of encapsulation at 240 k for the bnnt of 50 ",
    ". this could be in part attribute to mass and diameter tube differences .",
    "the major point however it is that in contrast to some previous works @xcite for the systems investigated here the symmetry breaking and chirality of bnnt do not seem to play important roles in determining the oscillatory regimes . the general oscillatory behavior ( figs . 3 and 4 ) , frequency values and axial displacement movements ( fig .",
    "5 ) are quite similar to the ones observed in the cnt case .",
    "in summary , we have carried out detailed analysis of extensive fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulation for ne atom oscillating inside carbon and boron nitride nanotubes of ( 5,5 ) chirality and different lengths ( 25 and 50  ) .",
    "our results show that well defined sustained oscillatory regimes are possible for a large range of temperatures ( from 5 up to 240 k ) .",
    "there are several stable frequencies for each one nano - oscillator configuration studied here , ranging from 58 to 137 * ghz*.",
    "another interesting aspect of these nanostructures is that we can tune the frequency by a suitable modification of the nanotube length and/or type .",
    "our results showed that the results for the bnnt are quite similar to the cnt ones in terms of general oscillatory behavior , frequency values , and axial displacement movements . in this sense",
    "our results are closer to the obtained by zeng _",
    "_ @xcite and in disagreement with the ones obtained by lin _",
    "we hope the present work to stimulate other studies along these lines .",
    "this work was supported in part by in / mct , immp / mct , theo - nano , brazilian nanotube network , and by the brazilian agencies cnpq , capes , fapesp and fapema ."
