    "particle creation in an expanding universe is one of the most interesting results that follows from quantum field theory when applied to curved backgrounds , and the year of 2016 marks fifty years of leonard parker s ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite where he developed the techniques to address the problem in a rigorous way .",
    "since then the problem has been studied in several articles @xcite and books @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting results that follows from the work of parker is that there is no creation of massless particles ( photons , for instance ) in a radiation dominated universe neither super massive particles in a matter dominated universe .",
    "this implies that there is no particle creation of the dominant type in the corresponding universe phase .",
    "two different methods are commonly used in order to study particle production by gravitational fields .",
    "the standard method , adopted by parker and others @xcite , is the method of the adiabatic vacuum state , where the vacuum state is defined as that one for which the lowest energy state smoothly goes to zero in the past ( @xmath0 ) and in the future ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the result is equivalent to consider a universe that started from a minkowski flat space at early times and evolves to a minkowski flat space at late times .",
    "the particle creation occurs between such different stages .",
    "another method is that of instantaneous hamiltonian diagonalization @xcite developed by grib and mamayev at the same time of the works of parker . in such approach",
    "the vacuum states are defined as those which minimizes the energy at a particular instant of time . in this method",
    "the creation rate is relatively higher than the adiabatic method @xcite .",
    "exact solutions for the rate of created particles are a difficult task , depending on the scale factor that describes the evolution of the universe and also on the type of particle that we would consider , namely , fermionic or bosonic particles and massive or massless particles . particularly , a scale factor of the form @xmath2 , with @xmath3 constants and @xmath4 is exactly soluble for scalar particles @xcite , where @xmath5 represents the conformal time .",
    "such kind of scale factor has interesting properties in the limit @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for which the universe behaves like radiation - dominated with @xmath8 and approaches to de sitter model with @xmath9 .",
    "also , in the limit @xmath10 and @xmath11 , this model can be compared to exact solutions for dirac particles @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study such case .",
    "another exactly soluble model for scalar particles is given by the scale factor @xmath12 with @xmath4 @xcite , while for @xmath9 we have solution for dirac particles @xcite .",
    "other recent works have studied the creation of massive and massless scalar particles @xcite , including modified gravity theories @xcite , super - heavy particles as candidates to dark matter @xcite and also fermionic spin @xmath13 particles @xcite in different backgrounds for different methods .",
    "it is important to stress that there are several differences between the calculations of creation of scalar particles and fermionic ones .",
    "for some few specific models the calculations are analytic and exactly soluble for both kind of particles .",
    "recent works have shown the existence of a new kind of non - standard spinor with interesting properties for the particle physics .",
    "it is constructed as a spin-@xmath13 field describing a fermion that is eigenstate of charge conjugation operator ( in contrast to dirac particles , that are eigenstate of parity conjugation operator ) , and was proposed by ahluwalia and grumiller @xcite .",
    "such new type of spinor , in contrast to the dirac spinor field , will violate either locality or lorentz invariance , or both .",
    "for this reason , sometimes they are called non - standard spinors ( nss ) , or dark spniors , since that they are naturally neutral , whereas dirac spinors are charged . a special class of such nss spinors are named elko , which has mass dimension one ( while dirac particles has mass dimension @xmath14 ) , which leads them to satisfy only a klein - gordon type equation . moreover , being a neutral field , they are a good candidate to a particle that does not interact electromagnetically with the standard model particles , exactly as desired for dark matter particles . exact solutions for elko spinor field coupled to gravity in curved friedmann - robertson - walker backgrounds was investigate in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the elko particle creation using the parker formalism .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we deduce the differential equation that governs the time mode function for the elko spinor in a general curved background .",
    "in section iii we particularize and study the solutions to an asymptotically expanding metric . in section",
    "iv the quantized field is constructed in terms of _ in _ and _ out _ solutions for the mode functions and the number density of created particles is obtained . in section",
    "v we compare with the results of scalar and dirac particles .",
    "we conclude in section vi .",
    "in which follows we will use @xmath15 for a general elko spinor defined in a curved background in four dimensions , @xmath16 for the elko spinor in the conformal time @xmath5 , @xmath17 for the elko spinor basis in flat space - time ( see appendix a ) , where @xmath18 stands for self - conjugate@xmath19anti - self - conjugate , @xmath20 for the helicities of the field and @xmath21 is the quantum field constructed with the above basis .",
    "the corresponding duals will be denoted by @xmath22 and similarly for the other quantities .",

    "taking @xmath209 for the elko number density we recover exactly the spectrum of the scalar particles , with a factor 2 coming from the two kinds of elko , namely self - conjugate and anti - self - conjugate .",
    "we also notice that greater the distance between the parameters @xmath131 and @xmath132 , lesser the number of created particles ( figs .",

    "2 ( d ) we see the effect of the parameter @xmath221 , that raises the number of created particles and enlarges the form of the spectrum ( compared to fig . 2 ( b ) for the same values of parameters ) .    in figure 3",
    "we compare the number of created particles as a function of its mass for some constant values of momenta .",
    "interesting to notice that for both dirac and scalar particles the number density of created particles goes to zero in the zero mass limit for every momenta , while for elko particles the number density increases in the null mass limit .",
    "a second maximum occurs for elko of small masses and momenta ( figs .",
    "3 ( a ) and ( b ) ) , in agreement to the maximum that also there exist for scalar and dirac particles . in the specific case of null mass and null momenta",
    "the number density diverges for elko particles .",
    "such behaviour is showed in figure 4 , for a 3d plotting .",
    "the presence of a second maximum is also evident from fig .",
    "although such result point to a infinite amount of created elko particles with zero mass at rest , the very definition of the elko field assures it must be massive .",
    "thus we can not have zero mass elko particles being created , since that such spinor is not defined at this limit .    as a last analysis we compare in figure 5 the number density of created particles just for elko and dirac , for slightly different masses as a function of its momenta .",
    "notice that the creation of elko particles is greater than dirac particles when its mass is lesser than the dirac one ( normalized to one ) . this has a interesting interpretation if we consider the elko as the candidate to dark matter in the universe .",
    "lighter elko particles are created in larger quantities than dirac fermionic particles",
    ". such difference could be responsible for the presence of about 5% of baryonic matter and 25% of dark matter particles in the actual universe .",
    "being more light than the baryonic particles , the elko particles are more difficult to be detected into accelerators for instance .",
    "in this paper we have analysed the gravitational particle creation of the elko spinor field for a metric scale factor of the form @xmath222 .",
    "such model admits exact analytic solutions for real scalar particles in general case and also for dirac particles in the limit @xmath213 , thus we have conditions to compare the spectrum of creation of elko particles with real scalar and fermionic dirac particles .",
    "the differential equation that governs the time mode function was obtained , eq . ( [ pe14 ] ) , being exactly a generalization of real scalar particles .",
    "analytic solutions of such equation were obtained for the aforementioned scale factor after using an approximation that permits to write the solutions by means of generalized hypergeometric functions , eq .",
    "( [ pe24 ] ) .",
    "finally , the number density of created elko particles was obtained , eq . ( [ pe73 ] ) .",
    "all the above results are generalization of the corresponding to real scalar particles .",
    "although being a fermion , the time dependent part of the elko spinor field follows an evolution similar to scalar particles .",
    "even so , in which concerns the spectrum of created particles , several interesting properties are present , as follows .",
    "for particles of same mass we have obtained that the number density of created elko particles is greater than scalar particles and lesser than dirac particles .",
    "for the three kinds of particles the maximum of creation occurs for null momenta , which is reasonable , since production of high kinetic energy particles needs much more gravitational field variation .",
    "the spectrum of density of created particles as a function of the its masses were also analysed for some constant values of the momenta .",
    "dirac and scalar particles have a maximum production for a non null mass and goes to zero in the null and high mass limit , similar to a thermal spectrum .",
    "elko particles presents a peculiar behaviour . in the zero mass limit",
    "the creation is maximum , going to infinity for null momenta .",
    "another consequence is that lighter elko particles can be created in more quantity than dirac particles . by considering the elko particles as candidate to dark matter in the universe",
    ", we interpreted that there exist much more light elko particles created gravitationally than baryonic fermionic particles .",
    "such result is confirmed by observations , since that there are about 25% of dark matter against about 5% of baryonic matter , according to standard model of cosmology .",
