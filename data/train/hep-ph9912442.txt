    "the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) analyses , in both the generalized   @xcite and the standard   @xcite frameworks , of two - loop effects in low - energy @xmath2 scattering lead to strong interaction corrections which are rather small as compared to the leading order and one - loop contributions , of the order of 5% in the case of the s wave scattering lengths @xmath3 and @xmath4 , for instance .",
    "this leads one to expect that higher order corrections to these quantities are well under control and can be safely neglected .",
    "however , these calculations were undertaken without taking into account isospin breaking effects , coming either from the mass difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks , or from the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the smallness of the two - loop corrections naturally raises the question of how they compare to these isospin breaking effects .",
    "the quark mass difference induces corrections of the order @xmath7 , which are expected to be negligible , as already known to be the case for the pion mass difference @xmath8 , the latter being in fact dominated by electromagnetic effects due to the virtual photon cloud   @xcite .    in the present contribution",
    ", we shall review the status of radiative corrections to the amplitude @xmath0   @xcite .",
    "the reason why we focus on the latter comes from the fact that it directly appears in the expression of the lifetime of the @xmath9 dimeson atom   @xcite ( see in particular the last of these references ) , that will be measured by the dirac experiment at cern   @xcite .",
    "the general framework for a systematic study of radiative corrections in chpt has been described in   @xcite .",
    "it consists in writing down a low - momentum representation for the generating functional of qcd green s functions of quark bilinears in the presence of the electromagnetic field , @xmath10}\\,=\\ , \\int{\\cal d}[\\mu]_{qcd}{\\cal d}[a_\\mu]e^{i\\int d^4x{\\cal l}}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath11q-{\\bar q}[s - i\\gamma_5 p]q   + a_\\mu[{\\overline{q_l}}\\gamma^\\mu q_lq_l+{\\overline{q_r}}\\gamma^\\mu q_rq_r ] . \\ ] ] here @xmath12 is the qcd lagrangian with @xmath13 flavours of massless quarks , while @xmath14 is the maxwell lagrangian of the photon field .",
    "the coupling of the latter to the left - handed and right - handed quark fields , @xmath15 , occurs via the spurion sources @xmath16 . under local @xmath17",
    "@xmath18 , they transform as ( the transformation properties of the vector ( @xmath19 ) , axial ( @xmath20 ) , scalar ( @xmath21 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath22 ) sources can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath23 so that the generating functional @xmath24 remains invariant ( up to the usual wess - zumino term ) .",
    "thus , although the electromagnetic interaction represents an explicit breaking of chiral symmetry , this breaking occurs in a well defined way , which is precisely the information encoded in the transformation properties of eq .",
    "[ transfo ] , much in the same way as the transformation properties of the scalar source @xmath25 conveys the information on how the quark masses break chiral symmetry . at the end of the calculation ,",
    "the sources @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are set to zero , @xmath25 becomes the diagonal quark mass matrix , while the electromagnetic spurions are turned into the diagonal charge matrix of the quarks .",
    "additional symmetries of @xmath24 consist of the discrete transformations like parity and charge conjugation .",
    "finally , @xmath29 is invariant under an additional charge conjugation type symmetry , which however affects only the photon field and the electromagnatic spurion sources , @xmath30 the low - energy representation of @xmath24 is constructed systematically in an expansion in powers of momenta , of quark masses and of the electromagnetic coupling , by computing tree and loop graphs with an effective lagrangian @xmath31 involving the @xmath32 matrix @xmath33 of pseudoscalar fields , and constrained by the chiral symmetry properties as well as the above discrete symmetries .    at lowest order , in the counting scheme",
    "where the electric charge @xmath34 and the spurions @xmath16 count as @xmath35 , the effective lagrangian is thus simply given by ( for the notation , we follow   @xcite ) @xmath36 the effect of the electromagnetic interaction is contained in the covariant derivative @xmath37 , defined as @xmath38 , and in the low - energy constant @xmath39 , which at this order is responsible for the mass difference of the charged and neutral pions , @xmath40 in fact , for the case of two light flavours ( @xmath41 ) , to which we restrict ourselves from now on , this is the only direct effect induced by this counterterm . of course",
    ", this mass splitting will in turn modify the kinematics of the low - energy @xmath2 amplitudes and the corresponding scattering lengths .",
    "the details of this lowest order analysis can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we shall rather consider the structure of the effective theory at next - to - leading order . besides the counterterms described by the well known low - energy constants @xmath42   @xcite , there are now , if we restrict ourselves to constant spurion sources , 11 additional counterterms at order @xmath43 , and three more at order @xmath44 .",
    "the latter contribute only to the scattering amplitudes involving charged pions alone .",
    "the complete list of these counterterms @xmath45 , @xmath46 and of their @xmath47-function coefficients can be found in refs .",
    "the computation of the amplitude @xmath48 for the process @xmath0 , including corrections of order @xmath43 and of order @xmath44 , is then a straightforward exercice in quantum field theory .",
    "the explicit expressions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and will not be reproduced here .",
    "let us rather discuss some features of the one - photon exchange graph of fig .",
    "1 , which induces an electromagnetic correction to the strong vertex .",
    "this graph contains both the long range coulomb interaction between the charged pions , and an infrared singularity .",
    "the latter is treated in the usual way , the physical , infrared finite , observable being the cross section for @xmath0 with the emission of soft photons ( one soft photon is enough at the order at which we are working here ) .",

    "the quantity @xmath58 , which is by itself free of the infrared divergence mentioned above , appears directly in the lifetime of the pionium atom   @xcite , the long range coulomb interaction being , in that case , absorbed by the bound state dynamics .",
    "the contributions of the low - energy constants @xmath45 are contained in the two quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "we have evaluated the radiative corrections of order @xmath43 and of order @xmath44 to the amplitude @xmath48 , which is relevant for the description of the pionium lifetime .",
