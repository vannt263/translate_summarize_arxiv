    "magnetic tunnel junctions using mgo as a tunnel barrier generally display large tunneling magneto resistance ( tmr ) and they are now widely used in read heads for ultra high - density hard - disk drives as well as in random access memory devices  @xcite",
    ". currently a room temperature tmr ratio as high as 500% can be reached in junctions made of polycrystalline fe ( more precisely cofeb ) sandwiching a thin mgo insulating layer @xcite . despite such huge tmr ratios the fe / mgo system presents two limiting aspects for future applications .",
    "firstly , there is no flexibility on the materials side , which means that high tmr ratios are achieved only for the fe / mgo combination and only for a particular crystal orientation , ( 100 ) .",
    "furthermore high crystallinity is needed as the electrodes themselves carry only a moderate spin - polarization of the conduction electrons .",
    "secondly , the tmr consistently decreases with increasing the applied voltage and/or the temperature and so the operation of a practical device utilizing a magnetic tunnel junction is limited to low bias @xcite .    the origin of the high tmr found in fe / mgo - based junctions is rooted in the spin filtering effect @xcite that mgo exerts on the conduction electrons injected from the fe electrodes @xcite .",
    "only electrons with specific symmetry and with small transverse momentum contribute significantly to the current . for energies around the fermi energy , @xmath3 ,",
    "these are found only in the majority fe states . as a consequence of this symmetry filtering the decay rate of the conduction electron wave - function into the mgo barrier of the majority spins is smaller than that of the minority ones @xcite .",
    "these decay rates are determined by the complex band structure ( cbs ) of the tunnel barrier @xcite .",
    "a crucial feature of the symmetry spin filtering effect is that tmr ratios larger than 1000% can be achieved , despite the fact that the spin - polarization of the electrodes is only around 65% ( for cofeb ) .",
    "another possible strategy for obtaining a spin filter effect , and thus very large tmr ratios , is that of using a ferromagnetic insulator as spacer between the metallic electrodes . in this case",
    "the energy barrier has a different height for majority and minority spins , which leads to the suppression of the current for one of the two spin - species for thick enough junctions .",
    "the tunnel current density is proportional to the energy - dependent transmission coefficient through the barrier , @xmath4 , which itself depends exponentially on the barrier height , @xmath5 , and the barrier thickness , @xmath6 .",
    "this can be written as @xmath7 $ ] , with @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the electron mass . clearly if the barrier height is different for the different spin - species the current polarizations will increase exponentially with the insulating layer thickness , leading to full spin polarization for thick barriers @xcite .",
    "devices constructed with this principles are called spin filter tunnel junctions ( sftjs ) .",
    "the quest for manufacturing sftjs then reduces to that of finding suitable ferromagnetic semiconductors .",
    "the europium chalcogenides eus , euse and euo have all a rocksalt structure and they are all ferromagnetic insulators . among these euo presents the largest conduction band exchange splitting , @xmath100.54  ev , below the material s curie temperature of 69  k @xcite . in euo",
    "the divalent eu ions possess a large local moment originating from the half - filled 4@xmath1 band ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "an energy gap of 1.1  ev separates the half - filled majority eu-4@xmath1 band from the eu-5@xmath0 conduction band @xcite .",
    "sftjs based on polycrystalline euo in the form of a metal / euo / metal heterojunction have been studied in several recent experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the spin transport properties of crystalline epitaxial euo junctions have not been studied theoretically so far .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide such theoretical insight .",
    "in particular we present _ ab - initio _",
    "results for the electronic structure and the electron transmission through euo barriers sandwiched between cu electrodes oriented along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start our discussion by presenting the methods used and the structure of the device investigated .",
    "then , in the following section we present the electronic structure of euo and its complex band structure along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "this determines the spin - dependent decay rates and thus the spin filter efficiency . in section",
    "iv we discuss the transmission coefficient at zero bias , while in section v the dependence of the spin transport on the euo thickness is analyzed and related to the complex band structure .",
    "the current - voltage , @xmath12-@xmath13 , characteristics are discussed in the following section , where we find that , in contrast to fe / mgo junctions , the polarization of the current is not reduced by the applied bias",
    ". finally we conclude .",
    "the euo and cu electronic structures are calculated by using the _ ab - initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) code siesta @xcite . since the local density approximation ( lda ) is not sufficient to give an accurate description of the euo density of states ( dos ) , we correct for on - site coulomb repulsion with an lda+u treatment @xcite .",

    "troullier - martins norm - conversing relativistic pseudopotentials are used for cu , eu and o. the wave functions are expanded over a double @xmath21 plus polarization basis set ( dzp ) , except for the eu-4@xmath1 states , for which we use single-@xmath21 .",
    "an equivalent real space mesh cutoff of 600  ry is used together with an electronic temperature of 69  k. we sample the brillouin zone ( bz ) in the plane perpendicular to the transport direction over a @xmath22 @xmath23-point uniform mesh .",
    "spin transport is studied by using the smeagol electronic transport code @xcite , which combines dft with the nonequilibrium green s functions ( negf ) technique .",
    "smeagol uses the hamiltonian matrix provided by siesta to calculate the charge density so that the same pseudopotentials and exchange and correlation function can be used for both the electronic structure and the transport .",

    "the total transmission coefficient is obtained by integrating the @xmath23-dependent transmission @xmath29 over the 2-dimensional bz perpendicular to the transport direction , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the area of the bz .",
    "we denote @xmath32 as the zero bias transmission coefficient . in our calculations",
    "we assume the lattice structure to be periodic in the @xmath33-@xmath34 plane , and we keep the transport direction along the @xmath35-axis . while @xmath22 @xmath23-points are enough to accurate converge the charge density , the presence of resonances in @xmath29 requires the much larger mesh of @xmath36 to evaluate the transmission coefficient both for zero and finite bias .",
    "the @xmath12-@xmath13 characteristics are calculated non - self - consistently by evaluating the transmission coefficient over an effective bias - dependent hamiltonian matrix , which in turns is obtained by adding a rigid shift to the zero bias hamiltonian matrix elements of the electrodes and a linear potential across the insulating barrier .",
    "this is a good approximation to the self - consistent potential drop for tunnel junctions @xcite , which appears essentially like that of a standard parallel plate capacitor .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_struct](a ) .",
    "since we consider transport along the [ 001 ] direction , we have to use as basic building block for the euo spacer a cell with size and orientation different from that of the primitive one .",

    "we consider fcc cu oriented along the [ 001 ] direction ( lattice constant 3.61   ) , a material choice which has been adopted in several experiments @xcite .",
    "when the tetragonal euo unit cell is used the lattice constant of cu can be matched with only a slight strain to the euo lattice , since the dimensions along @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath39  .",

    "however for the tetragonal cell they are independent since the x@xmath42 point is equivalent to @xmath43 in the tetragonal cell .",
    "there is a band gap of about 1.0  ev for majority spins ( fig .",
    "[ fig_band ] ) , whereas the gap increases to about 3.5 ev  for the minority ones . for the primitive fcc cell ( fig .",

    "this is consistent with the band structure , which shows that the eu-4@xmath1 states hybridize with the o-2@xmath18 and are rather delocalized .",

    "the overall result hence is that for any position of @xmath3 in the euo gap we expect a very high spin - polarization of the current .",

    "such value might be reduced by defects in the euo barrier as well as for polycrystalline euo .",
