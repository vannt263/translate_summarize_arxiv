    "let @xmath2 be a parametrized family of distributions .",
    "let @xmath3 be a sequence of independent random variables , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 . for each @xmath0",
    ", we suppose that the sequence @xmath7 is known up to a permutation , where for any sequence @xmath8 we denote the sub - sequence @xmath9 by @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the set @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 is @xmath7 without any order information .",
    "we consider in this note the problem of estimating it by @xmath14 under the loss @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the family @xmath17 is dominated by a measure @xmath18 , and denote the corresponding densities simply by @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the important example is , of course , @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the set of all _ simple symmetric decision functions _",
    "@xmath23 , that is , all @xmath23 such that @xmath24 , for some function @xmath25 . in particular , the best simple symmetric function is denoted by @xmath26 : @xmath27 and denote @xmath28 where , as usual , @xmath29 .",
    "the class of simple rules may be considered too restrictive .",
    "since the @xmath30s are known up to a permutation , the problem seems to be of matching the @xmath31s to the @xmath30s .",
    "thus , if @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , a reasonable decision would make @xmath34 closer to @xmath35 as @xmath36 gets larger .",
    "the simple rule clearly remains inefficient if the @xmath30s are well separated , and generally speaking , a bigger class of decision rules may be needed to obtain efficiency .",
    "however , given the natural invariance of the problem , it makes sense to be restricted to the class @xmath37 of all permutation invariant decision functions , i.e , functions @xmath23 that satisfy for any permutation @xmath38 and any @xmath39 :    let @xmath40 be the optimal permutation invariant rule under @xmath13 , and denote its risk by @xmath41    obviously @xmath42 , and whence @xmath43 .",
    "still , ` folklore ' , theorems in the spirit of de finetti , and results like hannan and robbins ( 1955 ) , imply that asymptotically ( as @xmath44 ) @xmath45 and @xmath46 will have ` similar ' risks .",
    "our main result establishes conditions that imply @xmath47 to repeat , is assumed known in this note . in the general decision theory framework",
    "the unknown parameter is the order of its member to correspond with @xmath48 , and the parameter space , therefore , corresponds to the set of all the permutation of @xmath49 .",
    "an asymptotic equivalence as above implies , that when we confine ourselves to the class of permutation invariant procedures , we may further restrict ourselves to the class of simple symmetric procedures , as is usually done in the standard analysis of compound decision problems .",
    "the later class is smaller and simpler .",
    "the motivation for this paper stems from the way the notion of oracle is used in some sparse estimation problems .",
    "consider two oracles both _ know _ the value of @xmath13 .",
    "oracle i is restricted to use only a procedure from the class @xmath50 , while oracle ii is restricted to use only procedures from @xmath51 .",
    "obviously oracle i has an advantage , our results quantify this advantage and show that it is asymptotically negligible .",
    "furthermore , starting with robbins ( 1951 ) various oracle - inequalities were obtained showing that one can achieve nearly the risk of oracle ii , by a ` legitimate ' statistical procedure .",
    "see , e.g. , the survey zhang ( 2003 ) , for oracle - inequalities regarding the difference in risks . see also brown and greenshtein ( 2007 ) , and jiang and zhang ( 2007 ) for oracle inequalities regarding the ratio of the risks . however , oracle ii is weak , and hence , these claims may seem to be too weak .",
    "our equivalence results , extend many of those oracle inequalities to be valid also with respect to oracle i. we needed a stronger result than the usual objective that the mean risks are equal up to @xmath52 difference .",
    "many of the above mentioned recent applications of the compound decision notion are about sparse situations when most of the @xmath30s are in fact 0 , the mean risk is @xmath52 , and the only interest is in total risk .",
    "let @xmath53 be some arbitrary ordering of @xmath13 .",
    "consider now the bayesian model under which @xmath54 , @xmath38 a random permutation , have a distribution given by where for every @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the set of all permutations of @xmath57 .",
    "the above description induces a joint distribution of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 for a random permutation @xmath38 .",
    "the first part of the following proposition is a simple special case of general theorems representing the best invariant procedure under certain groups , as bayes with respect to the appropriate haar measure ; for background see , e.g. , berger ( 1985 ) , chapter 6 .",
    "the second part of the proposition was derived in various papers starting with robbins ( 1951 ) .    in the following proposition and proof",
    ", @xmath60 is the expectation under the model in which the observations are independent and @xmath5 @xmath61 is the expectation under the above joint distribution of @xmath48 and @xmath62 .",
    "note that under the latter model , marginally @xmath63 , the empirical measure defined by , and conditional on @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "[ prop : basic ] the best simple and permutation invariant rules are given by    1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath68 , @xmath66 .",
    "3 .   suppose @xmath69 , then @xmath70 .",
    "we need only to give the standard proof of the third part .",
    "first , note that by invariance @xmath71 is an equalizer ( over all the permutations of @xmath13 ) , and hence @xmath72 .",
    "also @xmath73 . then , given the above joint distribution ,    we now briefly review some related literature and problems . on simple symmetric functions , compound decision and its relation to empirical bayes , see samuel ( 1965 ) , copas ( 1969 ) , robbins ( 1983 ) , zhang ( 2003 ) , among many other papers .",
    "hannan and robbins ( 1955 ) formulated essentially the same equivalence problem in testing problems , see their section 6 .",
    "they show for a special case an equivalence up to @xmath74 difference in the ` total risk ' ( i.e. , non - averaged risk ) .",
    "our results for estimation under squared loss are stated in terms of the total risk and we obtain @xmath1 difference .",
    "our results have a strong connection to de finetti s theorem .",
    "the exchangeability induced on @xmath75 , by the haar measure , implies ` asymptotic independence ' as in definetti s theorem , and consequently asymptotic independence of @xmath76 .",
    "thus we expect @xmath77 to be asymptotically similar to @xmath78 .",
    "quantifying this similarity as @xmath0 grows , has to do with the rate of convergence in definetti s theorem .",
    "such rates were established by diaconis and freedman ( 1980 ) , but are not directly applicable to obtain our results .    after quoting a simple result in the following section , we consider in section [ sec : bin ] the special important , but simple , case of two - valued parameter . in section [ sec : cont ]",
    "we obtain a strong result under strong conditions .",
    "finally , the main result is given in section [ sec : main ] , it covers the two preceding cases , but with some price to pay for the generality .",
    "the following lemma is standard in comparison of experiments theory ; for background on comparison of experiments in testing see lehmann ( 1986 ) , p-86 .",
    "the proof follows a simple application of jensen s inequality .",
    "[ lem : expcomp ] consider two pairs of distribution , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "suppose that there exists a markov kernel such that @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "then for any convex function @xmath83    for simplicity denote @xmath84 , and for any random variable @xmath85 , we may write @xmath86 if @xmath87 is its density with respect to a certain dominating measure . finally , for simplicity we use the notation @xmath88 to denote the sequence @xmath89 without its @xmath90 member , and similarly @xmath91 .",
    "finally @xmath92 is the marginal density of @xmath93 under the model conditional on @xmath94 .",
    "we suppose in this section that @xmath30 can get one of two values which we denote by @xmath95 . to simplify notation we denote the two densities by @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "suppose that either of the following two conditions hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath98 has a finite variance under @xmath99 .",
    "2 .   @xmath100 , and @xmath98 has a finite variance under @xmath101 or @xmath102",
    ".    then @xmath103",
    ".    suppose condition ( i ) holds .",
    "let @xmath104 , and suppose , wlog , that @xmath105 .",
    "consider the bayes model of . by bayes",
    "theorem where , with some abuse of notation @xmath106 is the joint density of @xmath107 conditional on @xmath108 . on the other hand    we use lemma [ lem : expcomp ] to compare the testing between @xmath109 vs. @xmath110 to an easier problem , from which the original problem can be obtained by adding a random permutation .",
    "suppose for simplicity and wlog that in fact @xmath111 are under @xmath112 , while @xmath113 are under @xmath114 .",
    "then we compare the true distribution , to the mixture however , the likelihood ratio between @xmath115 and @xmath116 is a sum of @xmath117 terms , each with mean 0 ( under @xmath116 ) and finite variance .",
    "it is , therefore , @xmath118 in the mean square .",
    "consider now the second condition . by assumption",
    ", @xmath119 is of the same order as @xmath0 , and we can assume , wlog , that the @xmath120 has a finite variance under @xmath114 . with this understanding ,",
    "the above proof holds for the second condition .",
    "the condition of the theorem is clearly satisfied in the normal shift model : @xmath121 , @xmath82 .",
    "it is satisfied for the normal scale model , @xmath122 , @xmath82 , if @xmath119 is of the same order as @xmath0 , or if @xmath123 .",
    "we consider now another simple case in which @xmath13 can be ordered @xmath124 such that the difference @xmath125 is uniformly small .",
    "this will happen if , for example , @xmath13 is in fact a random sample from a distribution with density with respect to lebesgue measure , which is bounded away from 0 on its support , or more generally , if it sampled from a distribution with short tails .",
    "denote by @xmath126 and @xmath127 the corresponding ordering of the @xmath31s and @xmath128s .",
    "we assume in this section    1 .",
    "for some slowly converging to infinity constants @xmath129 and @xmath130 :    note that condition * ( b1 ) * holds for both the normal shift model and the normal scale model , if behaves like a sample from a distribution with a density as above .",
    "if assumption * ( b1 ) * holds then    by definition where @xmath131 is the density of @xmath107 under @xmath132 :    the result will follow if we argue that @xmath133 .",
    "in fact we will establish a slightly stronger claim that where @xmath134 denotes the total variation norm .",
    "we will bound this distance by the distance between two other densities .",
    "let @xmath135 , the true distribution of @xmath107 .",
    "we define now a similar analog of @xmath131 .",
    "let @xmath136 and @xmath137 be defined by @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "suppose , for simplicity , that @xmath141 .",
    "let note that @xmath142 depends only on @xmath132 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath143 , then one can obtain @xmath144 by the markov kernel that takes @xmath145 to a random permutation of itself .",
    "it follows from lemma [ lem : expcomp ] but , by assumption is a reversed @xmath146 martingale , and it follows from assumption * ( b1 ) * that similar argument applies to @xmath90 , @xmath147 , yielding but then we argue the theorem follows .",
    "we assume that for some @xmath148 :      both assumptions describe a situation where the @xmath30s do not  separate \" .",
    "they can not be too far one from another , geometrically or statistically ( assumption * ( g1 ) * ) , and they are dense in the sense that each @xmath31 can be explained by many of the @xmath30s ( assumption * ( g2 ) * ) .",
    "the conditions hold for the normal shift model if @xmath153 are uniformly bounded : suppose the common variance is 1 and @xmath154",
    ". then and the first part of * ( g2 ) * hold .",
    "the other parts follow a similar calculations .",
    "it was mentioned already in the introduction that when we are restricted to permutation invariant procedure we can consider the bayesian model under which @xmath54 , @xmath38 a random permutation , have a distribution given by .",
    "fix now @xmath157 . under this model",
    "we want to compare to more explicitly : where for all @xmath158 , @xmath159 was defined in section [ sec : basic ] , and    note that @xmath160 , and @xmath161 is the likelihood ratio between two ( conditional on @xmath162 ) densities of @xmath163 , say @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "consider two other densities ( again , conditional on @xmath162 ) : note that @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the markov kernel that takes @xmath163 to a random permutation of itself .",
    "it follows from lemma [ lem : expcomp ] that this expectation does not depend on @xmath169 : @xmath90 is related only to the @xmath31s while @xmath169 is related only to @xmath13 .",
    "hence , to simplify notation , we take wlog @xmath170 . denote where @xmath171 is as in * ( g1)*. then by by * g1*. bound where @xmath172 ( the 1 is for the @xmath90th summand ) . hence by large deviation .",
