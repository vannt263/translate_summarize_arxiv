    "the phenomenon of photon blockade , first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in analogy with coulomb blockade for electrons @xcite , occurs when the absorption of a first input photon by an optical device blocks the transmission of a second one , thereby leading to nonclassical output photon statistics .",
    "photon blockade has been predicted in many different settings @xcite , including for a single two - level atom in cavity qed @xcite . in the latter",
    "setting , the blockade is due to the anharmonicity of the jaynes - cummings ladder of eigenstates @xcite .",
    "if an incoming photon resonantly excites the atom - cavity system from its ground state to @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 denotes the @xmath2-excitation dressed state with higher ( lower ) energy ) , then a second photon at the same frequency will be detuned from either of the next steps up the ladder , i.e. from states @xmath3 . in the strong coupling regime @xcite ,",
    "for which the coherent rate of evolution @xmath4 exceeds the dissipative rates @xmath5 and @xmath6 , this detuning will be much larger than the excited - state line widths , so that the two - excitation manifold will rarely be populated .",
    "this in turn leads to the ordered flow of photons in the transmitted field , which emerge from the cavity one at a time .     in cesium.,width=480 ]",
    "we recently reported observations of photon blockade in the light transmitted by an optical cavity containing one atom strongly coupled to the cavity field @xcite .",
    "for coherent excitation at the cavity input , the photon statistics for the cavity output displayed both photon antibunching and sub - poissonian photon statistics .",
    "however , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ system ] , the multiplicity of atomic and cavity states makes our experiment considerably more complex than the simple situation described by the extended jaynes - cummings model with damping @xcite . in our paper @xcite and the accompanying supplemental information @xcite , we presented theoretical results from an extended model that described a multistate atom coupled to two cavity modes .",
    "the relevant atomic states are the zeeman states of a particular hyperfine transition in atomic cesium , namely @xmath7 at @xmath8 nm . the relevant modes of the fabry - perot cavity are two tem@xmath9 modes of the same longitudinal order but orthogonal polarizations .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to provide a more complete discussion of photon blockade than in ref .",
    "@xcite , both by way of particular results from our model calculation and of a general framework for characterization of photon blockade , with which we begin in section ii . in section",
    "iii we turn to the details of our actual system and calculate the eigenvalue structure for a two - mode cavity coupled to an atom with multiple internal states . here",
    ", we make explicit the coupling in the model hamiltonian which is used to determine the eigenvalues displayed in figure 1(b ) of ref .",
    "we also incorporate this hamiltonian into the master equation for the damped , driven system used to compute theoretical results for transmission spectra and photon statistics , as in figure 2(b ) of ref .  @xcite . in section iv",
    ", we gain some perspective on the relevant physical mechanisms by comparing transmission spectra and photon statistics for the case of an external drive that excites the atom ( rather than the cavity , as in our experiment ) .",
    "section v presents an extension to our atom - cavity model which includes the effect of cavity birefringence and fort - induced ac - stark shifts in the atomic states .",
    "the modified cavity transmission and intensity correlation functions are presented for comparison to previous results .",
    "we also display a theoretical result for the time dependence of the intensity correlation function for comparison to our measured result in ref .",
    "finally , in section vi we offer a discussion of these various results .",
    "we begin by attempting to address the question what is photon blockade?@xcite .",
    "consider the following input electromagnetic field state to some black box,@xmath10assume that the mapping of input to output by the black box is given by the transmission coefficients @xmath11 for each fock - state @xmath12 .",
    "the output state is then of the form@xmath13for a coherent - state input @xmath14 , @xmath15 , so that@xmath16a linear transfer function for the black box would be of the form @xmath17 , so that@xmath18    by contrast , a nonlinear device can modify the photon statistics in a fashion other than @xmath19 .",
    "the working criterion that we adopt here for photon blockade is that the transmission coefficients @xmath20 ( @xmath21 for @xmath22 ) would lead to the following output for a coherent state input:@xmath23likewise , a device that produces photon pairs in abundance ( and an associated large degree of photon bunching ) could be specified by @xmath24 , the above discussion is incomplete since at least one additional input and output channel is required to preserve unitarity . more generally , the transformation @xmath25 requires multiple input and output channels ( e.g. , polarizations for the input and output fields with a continuum of frequencies , relevant quantum degrees of freedom for the material system of the black box , etc . ) .",
    "these additional channels may affect the coherence of the output field , as discussed below in section vi . within this more complex setting",
    ", however , the conceptual framework that we suggest for identifying photon blockade still rests upon the simple intuition described above .",
    "namely , one of the output channels should have the property that the transmission coefficients @xmath26 satisfy @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "note that the pioneering work on photon blockade based upon eit satisfies the above criterion @xcite , as does resonance fluorescence from a single atom @xcite and the cavity qed  schemes considered in refs .",
    "tian92,rebic02,brecha99,hood - thesis . indeed , by the criterion stated above , most single atomic or molecular emitters function by way of photon blockade .",
    "the problem of course is that the efficiency for collecting fluorescence is typically poor .",
    "so , in addition to the more fundamental requirement @xmath27 , it seems reasonable to add a second , more practical criterion related to efficiency .",
    "photon blockade is of much less practical significance if the efficiency for the mapping of input to an output channel is negligibly small , but precisely how small is too small  is hard to quantify and depends upon the particular application .",
    "much of the effort related to photon blockade is directed towards maintaining the quality  of blockade inherent in single - atom resonance fluorescence while at the same time achieving a sensibly large efficiency , which has led our group to employ an optical cavity within the setting of cavity qed , a system to which we now turn our attention .",
    "we begin this section , adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite , by considering the eigenvalue structure of the atom - cavity system in the absence of damping , with the model system illustrated in figure [ system ] . approximating the atom - cavity coupling as a dipole interaction ,",
    "we define the atomic dipole transition operators for the @xmath29 transition in atomic cesium as @xmath30where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the dipole operator for @xmath33-polarization , respectively , normalized such that for the cycling transition @xmath34 .",
    "the matrix element of the dipole operator @xmath35 is equal to the clebsch - gordan coefficient for adding spin @xmath36 to spin @xmath37 to reach total spin @xmath38 , namely @xmath39 .",

    "the total number of states in any manifold can be understood by considering how the excitations can be distributed among the atom and the two cavity modes .",
    "for example , in the @xmath58 manifold , the atom can be in one of its @xmath64 ground states ( @xmath65 ) and either cavity mode @xmath66 or mode @xmath67 can have one photon ( giving @xmath68 possible states ) , or the atom can be in one of its @xmath69 excited states ( @xmath70 ) while both cavity modes are in the vacuum state , yielding a total of 29 states .",

    "although these eigenvalues are certainly not sufficient for understanding the complex dynamics associated with the full master equation , they do provide some insight into some structural aspects of the atom - cavity system .",
