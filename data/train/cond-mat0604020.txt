    "<S> we propose fesb@xmath0 to be a nearly ferromagnetic small gap semiconductor , hence a direct analog of fesi . </S>",
    "<S> we find that despite different compositions and crystal structures , in the local density approximation with on - site coulomb repulsion correction ( lda+@xmath1 ) method magnetic and semiconducting solutions for @xmath1=2.6  ev are energetically degenerate similar to the case of fesi . </S>",
    "<S> for both fesb@xmath0 and fesi ( fesi@xmath2ge@xmath3 alloys ) the underlying transition mechanism allows one to switch from a small gap semiconductor to a ferromagnetic metal with magnetic moment @xmath4 per fe ion with external magnetic field .    the unusual crossover from a small gap semiconductor at low temperatures to a metallic state with enhanced magnetic fluctuations above room temperature observed in fesi has long been a subject of great interest  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two different models have been proposed to explain this anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> one proposal is that fesi is a kondo insulator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second is that fesi is a nearly ferromagnetic semiconductor  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this latter proposal is supported by _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations using the lda+@xmath1 method  @xcite which found that a ferromagnetic metallic state was very close by in energy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further support for this second model comes from the direct observation of this semiconductor - metal transition as the lattice is expanded by the isoelectronic substitution of ge for si  @xcite . in order to determine critical magnetic field a minimal two - band model with interband interaction was suggested . even in the mean field approximation </S>",
    "<S> the model nicely describes the full phase diagram of the fesi@xmath3ge@xmath2 alloy series  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a second fe - compound , fesb@xmath0 , was found to have a similar crossover as fesi from a small gap semiconductor to a metallic state with strong magnetic fluctuations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this raises immediately the question whether _ ab initio _ calculations confirm the close analogy between the two fe compounds . </S>",
    "<S> this is a nontrivial question since these electronic structure calculations show strong hybridization between the fe-3@xmath5 orbitals and the @xmath6-@xmath7 electrons of the close si or sb neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> this strong hybridization clashes with the assumption of weak hybridization between localized and itinerant electrons that underlies a kondo insulator description and makes it difficult to relate the kondo insulator model to the _ ab initio _ electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> however in view of the differing compositions and crystal structures of fesi and fesb@xmath0 it is by no means obvious that closely similar models can be derived from _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations for both compounds . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason it is clearly important to examine fesb@xmath0 closely .    </S>",
    "<S> fesb@xmath0 crystallizes in the marcasite crystal structure  @xcite . each fe atom </S>",
    "<S> is surrounded by a slightly distorted octahedron of sb neighbors with 2 neighbors at 2.57   and 4 at 2.59  . </S>",
    "<S> the octahedra are corner sharing in the @xmath8 plane and edge sharing along the @xmath9-axis .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of density functional calculations using a local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite within tb - lmto - asa program  @xcite are shown in figures  [ fig : dosfesb2 ] and [ fig : bandsfesb2 ] ( the calculations were performed without spin - polarization ) . </S>",
    "<S> atomic spheres radii were chosen as r(fe ) = 2.67 a.u . and r(sb ) </S>",
    "<S> = 2.99 a.u . </S>",
    "<S> , in asa approximation to fulfil the volume 6 classes of empty spheres were inserted with radii from 1.56 to 0.81 a.u . </S>",
    "<S> the overall bandwidth is @xmath1010  ev with strong fe - sb hybridization due to the short fe - sb bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the density of states ( dos ) is shown in figure  [ fig : dosfesb2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy lies in a small band gap similar to the case of fesi . </S>",
    "<S> also in figure  [ fig : dosfesb2 ] the dos broken down in fe-3@xmath5(@xmath11 ) and sb-4@xmath7 states is displayed . </S>",
    "<S> narrow bands appear above and below the band gap with predominantly 3@xmath5 character  again similar to the case of fesi . </S>",
    "<S> there is however a substantial contribution of the sb-4@xmath7 states to valence band peak just below the fermi energy but in the interval from the fermi energy to @xmath101  ev sb-4@xmath7 states are presented very weakly .    the band structure of fesb@xmath0 is presented in figure  [ fig : bandsfesb2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a small indirect energy gap with the minimum in the conduction bands lying on the gz - lines and the maxima of the valence band is at the r - point . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow peak in the dos at the bottom of the conduction band arises from the flat bands that extend over roughly half of the brillouin near the z- and r - points . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital character of these flat bands is predominantly @xmath12 ( in the global coordinate system ) as illustrated in figure  [ fig : bandsfesb2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are 3@xmath5 orbitals pointing away from the sb - sites in the octahedra surrounding the fe atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the top of the valence band lies mostly in the dos peak @xmath100.3  ev below the conduction band and has predominantly 3@xmath5 ( @xmath13)-character . </S>",
    "<S> there is however a small density of states with mostly sb-@xmath7 character which is responsible for the small indirect band gap .    </S>",
    "<S> the main feature of the lda band structure is this small gap ( @xmath100.3  ev ) between relatively flat bands of 3@xmath5 character giving rise to sharp peaks in the dos . </S>",
    "<S> but the sb-4@xmath7 band contributes small density of states in this gap with zero at the fermi level . in reference  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite from measurements of optical reflectivity the semiconducting optical gap was estimated as e@xmath14=0.035 ev . this value is larger than that obtained from the resistivity measurements @xmath100.02 - 0.025 ev ( see reference  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is similar to fesi except that e@xmath14 does not show any dependence on temperature up to the crossover temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the lda approximation was extended to allow for spin and orbital polarization by anisimov _ </S>",
    "<S> et  al . </S>",
    "<S> _  @xcite by introducing a local coulomb repulsion , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this lda+@xmath1 method when applied to fesi found that there was a ferromagnetic metallic state very close by in energy to the small gap semiconducting state of the lda . </S>",
    "<S> the exact energy difference between the two depends on the choice of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this result of lda+@xmath1 is nicely confirmed by the fact that the isostructural - isoelectronic compound fege has the ferromagnetic metallic ground state . </S>",
    "<S> actually if spin - orbit terms were included the ferromagnetism of fege would develop a long period spiral structure as observed in practice due to the presence of a dzyaloshinskii - moriya term in resulting from the absence of inversion about the fe sites .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram of the fesi@xmath3ge@xmath2 alloys can be reproduced by choosing the reasonable value of @xmath1 , an onsite coulomb repulsion on the fe sites of @xmath1=3.7  ev  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have applied the lda+@xmath1 method to fesb@xmath0 . as in the case of fesi </S>",
    "<S> a second local minimum appears in the energy vs. uniform magnetization at a value of 1 @xmath15 per fe ( see figure  [ fig : magnfesb2 ] ) . in this set of calculations we performed fixed spin moment procedure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> again the exact energy difference between the two minima is dependent on the value of @xmath1 .    in all our calculation </S>",
    "<S> we used the value @xmath16=0.88 ev for the exchange ( hund s ) coulomb parameter but varied the value of direct coulomb parameter @xmath1 . as a result , in fesb@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> we found the critical value of the direct coulomb parameter @xmath17=2.6 ev . </S>",
    "<S> as in fesi and fesi@xmath3ge@xmath2 alloys , for any value of the @xmath1 parameter less than @xmath17 it is the nonmagnetic ground state that is lower in total energy . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise for the @xmath1 values above @xmath17 ferromagnetic state is lower in energy . only for @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> these two states have the same energy .    </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the total fesb@xmath0 density of states near the fermi energy to fesi is shown in figure  [ fig : doscomp ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the close similarity between the lda+@xmath1 results for fesi and fesb@xmath0 agrees well with the close correspondence in their properties . </S>",
    "<S> it demonstrates the nearly ferromagnetic character of these small gap semiconductors . </S>"
