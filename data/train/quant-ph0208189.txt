    "recently a novel paradigm was suggested for the design of quantum algorithms for solving combinatorial search and optimization problems based on quantum adiabatic evolution @xcite . in the quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm ( qaa )",
    "a quantum state closely follows a ground state of a specially designed slowly varying in time control hamiltonian . at the initial moment of time",
    "the control hamiltonian has a simple form with the known ground state that is easy to prepare ; at the final moment of time it coincides with the problem ",
    "hamiltonian @xmath9 whose ground state encodes the solution of the classical optimization problem in question .",
    "it can also be chosen to reflect the bit - structure and cost spectrum of the problem .",
    "for example , @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a cost function defined on a set of @xmath12 binary strings @xmath13 @xmath14 , each containing @xmath0 bits .",
    "the summation in ( [ hp ] ) is over @xmath12 states @xmath15 forming the computational basis of a quantum computer with @xmath0 qubits .",
    "state @xmath16 of the @xmath17-th qubit is an eigenstate of the pauli matrix @xmath18 with eigenvalue @xmath19 . if at the end of the qaa the quantum state is sufficiently close to the ground state of @xmath9 then the solution to the optimization problem can be retrieved by measurement .",
    "running of the algorithm for several np - complete problems has been simulated on a classical computer using a large number of randomly generated problem instances that are believed to be computationally hard for classical algorithms @xcite .",
    "results of these numerical simulations for relatively small size of the problem instances ( @xmath20 20 ) suggest a _ quadratic _ scaling law of the run time of the quantum adiabatic algorithm with @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that the previous query complexity argument that lead to the exponential lower bound for unstructured search @xcite can not be used to rule out the polynomial time solution of np - complete satisfiability problem by qaa",
    ".    on the other hand , a set of examples of the 3-satisfiability problem has been recently constructed @xcite to test analytically the power of qaa in the situations where the optimization problem in question has multiple well - separated local minima .    in these examples",
    "the cost function @xmath11 depends on a bit - string @xmath21 with @xmath0 bits , @xmath22 , only via the hamming weight of the string , @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 .",
    "the function @xmath25 is multi - modal , it has a local minimum separated from the global minimum by the barrier of an order-@xmath0 width in @xmath26 .",
    "for that reason classical local search like simulating annealing provably fails to find a globally optimal solution in time polynomial in @xmath0 .",
    "it @xcite a standard ",
    "qaa was applied to this problem in which a quantum evolution begins in a uniform superposition state @xmath27 , ends in a target ( solution ) state @xmath28 , and the control hamiltonian is a linear interpolation in time between the initial and final hamiltonians .    for the above examples it was shown @xcite that the system can be trapped during the qaa in the local minimum of a cost function for a time that grows exponentially in the problem size @xmath0 .",
    "it was also shown @xcite that an exponential delay time in qaa can be computed in terms of a quantum - mechanical tunneling for an auxiliary large spin system .",
    "it can also be inferred from @xcite that qaa will have an exponential complexity even if the cost function @xmath11 no longer depends strictly on a hamming weight but the deviation only occurs for states @xmath15 that have exponentially small ( in @xmath0 ) overlap with the adiabatic ground state wavefunction @xmath29 at all times during the algorithm execution .",
    "the above example has a significance more than just being a particular simplified case of the binary optimization problem with symmetized cost .",
    "indeed one can argue that it shows one of the mechanisms for setting locality traps  in the 3-satisfiability problem @xcite .",
    "but most importantly , this example demonstrates that exponential complexity of qaa results from a _ collective phenomenon _ in which transitions between the bit - configurations with low - lying energies can only occur by the simultaneous flipping of large clusters containing order - n bits . in many cases these transitions",
    "can be analyzed as a tunneling of spin variables .",
    "a similar phenomenon related to the tunneling of magnetization was recently observed in the large - spin molecular nanomagnets @xcite .",
    "however low - energy collective behavior is also well known in spin glass models , many of which are in one - to - one correspondence with random np - complete problems @xcite .",
    "in particular , an important ingredient of the replica symmetry breaking  picture of an infinite - range spin glass by parizi @xcite is that there are collective spin exitations that are of the order of the system size @xmath0 whose energy is @xmath30 , i.e. , it does not grow with the size of the system . a similar picture",
    "may be applicable to random satisfiability problems @xcite .",
    "therefore in connection to the above example , it is important to understand how to design a polynomial time qaa without a prior knowledge of a particular form of the cost function @xmath31 ( possibly multi - modal or even randomly sampled ) , so that a tunneling barrier between the local minima will be totally suppressed .",
    "this is a focus of the present paper @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin ] we present a theory of quantum adiabatic evolution of a large spin system introducing a control hamiltonian that guarantees polynomial time complexity for qaa in the symmetrized 3-satisfiability example mentioned . in sec .",

    "in a standard qaa @xcite one specifies the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is dimensionless time `` .",

    "therefore a measurement performed on the quantum computer at @xmath58 will find one of the solutions of combinatorial optimization problem with large probability .",

    "the numerator in ( [ mingap ] ) is less than the largest eigenvalue of @xmath65 , typically polynomial in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath66 can scale down exponentially with @xmath0 and in such cases the runtime of quantum adiabatic algorithm will grow exponentially fast with the size of the input @xmath0 .",
    "consider a cost function @xmath11 in the following form : @xmath67 this cost is symmetric with respect to the permutation of bits and @xmath68 is a hamming weight of a string @xmath21 .",
    "a particular example of this problem related to 3-satisfiability was introduced in @xcite ( the discussion in this subsection closely follows @xcite , sec .",

    "it was shown @xcite that if one uses @xmath40 in a form corresponding to ( [ hd ] ) @xmath87 then the minimum gap @xmath66 scales down exponentially with @xmath0 implying the exponential complexity of qaa for this problem .",
    "in this paper we show that the main reason for the exponentially small minimum gap for the problem ( [ 3sat ] ) with @xmath40 given in ( [ hdfarhi ] ) is the fact that the ground state of the driving hamiltonian is * localized * in the space of the @xmath2-projections of a total spin .",
    "we construct an example of the driving hamiltonian with * extended * ground state and show that in this case the evolution time of qaa is polynomial in the number of qubits .    in the following",
    "we adopt the notation for the total spin @xmath88 , with @xmath89 , where @xmath90 are the projections of the total spin operator on the @xmath17-th axis .",

    ", the adiabatic evolution of the delocalized states is fundamentally different from the localized ones . in particular , the localized ground states in general result in macroscopic tunneling .",
    "this gives the exponentially small in @xmath0 ground state energy gaps and consequently the exponentially large complexity of qaa .",
    "using the delocalized states one can avoid macroscopic tunneling .",
    "we argue that in a general situation when the information about the ground state is not used for constructing the driver hamiltonian , the driver with extended ground state should lead to polynomial complexity of adiabatic algorithms independently of the specific form of the problem hamiltonian provided that it is expressed as a function ( in general , nonlinear ) of the total spin operators , @xmath90 ( cf .",
    "( [ 3sathp ] ) ) .",
    "to be specific , we refer to the same problem hamiltonian as in eq .",
    "( [ 3sathp ] ) .",
    "the full hamiltonian takes the following form in the limit of large @xmath0 @xmath116 where @xmath117 ; @xmath118 and function @xmath119 is given in ( [ h ] ) .",
    "in order to get a simple physical picture , we will refer to the wkb - type approach commonly used in the theory of quantum spin tunneling in magnetics ( qtm ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this approach is applicable for large spins @xmath120 , which is the case of interest for us .",
    "we choose @xmath100 as a quantization axis and following the standard procedure obtain the effective quasi - classical hamiltonian in polar coordinates @xmath121 with @xmath122 $ ] and @xmath123 $ ] . in doing this , we make use of the following relations valid in the limit @xmath120 @xmath124 as it was shown in @xcite , in the quasi - classical limit we have @xmath125 which means that the motion of the quasi - classical spin can be described as a 1d motion of a massive particle on a unit radius ring in the appropriate effective potential @xmath126 .",
    "we also have @xmath127 substituting this into ( [ s_x_21 ] ) , we finally obtain the effective quasi - classical hamiltonian in the form @xmath128 one should note that the driver @xmath129 does not change the effective potential caused by @xmath130 and only introduces the effective kinetic energy into the problem . as we show below , this driver has extended eigenstates in the space of the @xmath2-projections @xmath109 of a total spin , as opposed to the case @xmath131 considered in @xcite , where the eigenstates are localized in @xmath109 .",
    "as we will see below , this leads to the absence of tunneling and polynomial gap in our case as opposed to the exponentially small tunneling amplitude arising in @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic wave functions @xmath132 satisfy @xmath133 \\psi _ { k}\\left ( \\varphi \\right ) = \\widetilde{e}_{k}\\left ( \\tau \\right ) \\psi _ { k}\\left ( \\varphi \\right ) ,   \\label{schr_qc_1}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 is a rescaled energy .",
    "the first term in the l.h.s . of ( [ schr_qc_1 ] ) corresponds to the driving hamiltonian @xmath135 and presents the kinetic energy of the particle moving in the effective potential due to the problem hamiltonian @xmath136 at initial moment @xmath137 , the total hamiltonian reduces to the driver @xmath135 which describes a free massive particle on a ring and its eigenstates are well known @xcite . in this case , the schrdinger equation ( [ schr_qc_1 ] ) gives exact wavefunctions and spectrum .",
    "namely , we have    @xmath138    where @xmath139 is an integer number @xmath140 for even @xmath0 when the total spin @xmath141 is integer , and a half - integer number @xmath142 for an odd number of qubits @xmath0 , when @xmath143 + 1/2 $ ] .",
    "one should note that in case of integer spin @xmath115 , all eigenstates are twofold degenerate except for the ground state corresponding to @xmath144 and for the half - integer spin , all states including the ground state are twofold degenerate .",
    "this is a particular case of the kramers degeneracy @xcite , @xcite , which occurs due to the symmetry with respect to the spin - flip transformation .",
    "note that since from ( [ u_1 ] ) it follows that @xmath145 , the states ( [ schr_qc_2 ] ) are indeed delocalized in the @xmath109-space .    from ( [ schr_qc_1 ] )",
    ", it follows that the problem hamiltonian is of the same order of magnitude as the driving one only for sufficiently short times @xmath146 .",
    "this means that the problem hamiltonian is of the order of the level separation of the kinetic term only for sufficiently small times .",
    "since the eigenstates of the driving hamiltonian are extended ( delocalized ) in @xmath109 , this implies the following qualitative picture of adiabatic evolution of the ground energy level with @xmath147 . at sufficiently small times",
    "@xmath148 , the term due to @xmath130 can be considered as a perturbation to the driver term and the energy levels are not strongly distorted .",
    "the eigenstates are delocalized in the @xmath109 space . as @xmath147 increases",
    ", the ground state is affected by the perturbation and the ground state energy increases .",
    "if the ground state is not degenerate ( this is the case when the total number of qubits @xmath97 is even ) , the gap may have a non - monotonic behavior in @xmath147 in the range @xmath146 . qualitatively , this can be described as follows . for sufficiently small times",
    "@xmath148 , the ground state energy is increasing in @xmath147  due to the diagonal matrix elements of the problem hamiltonian until compensated by the level repulsion from the first excited state .",
    "after this , the ground state is pushed down and gradually approaches the ground state of @xmath130 ( which is @xmath149 in the present case ) .",
    "since the upper levels are not as strongly affected by the perturbation as the ground state and since the number of upper levels is very large , @xmath150 , the system of upper levels behaves as a rigid one . for this reason",
    "the strong interaction between the ground and first excited states occurs in the range of energies @xmath151 corresponding to the the level separation in the driver hamiltonian and is linear in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore @xmath152 where @xmath153 denotes the separation between the two lowest eigenvalues of @xmath9 . clearly , the energy scale of the minimal gap is polynomial in the number of qubits @xmath0 provided that @xmath153 is polynomial .",
    "as we have discussed above , in case of an odd number of qubits , all initial eigenstates of @xmath135 have a twofold degeneracy ( kramers degeneracy ) . in this case , the degeneracy is removed by the effective potential ( zeeman splitting ) and there is no avoided - crossing between the ground state and the first excited states of the total hamiltonian @xmath8 .",
    "one can easily show that in this case the level separation @xmath154 grows monotonically in @xmath147 @xcite ( it is linear in @xmath155 for @xmath156 ) .",
    "apart from the features occurring in the range of small @xmath157 , the evolution of the ground state on the large time scale @xmath158 is the same for both even and odd number of qubits .",
    "most importantly , the estimate ( [ gap_1 ] ) holds globally in both cases . as we will see below ,",
    "this is confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "as we discussed above , the ground state energy may have a non - monotonic time dependence on @xmath147 when the total number of qubits is even and the ground state of @xmath135 is not degenerate .",
    "because the eigenvalues of the driver hamiltonian , @xmath159 , grow rapidly with the quantum number @xmath139 it is possible to obtain a minimum gap estimate analyzing how @xmath130 affects the two lowest eigenvalues of the driver .",
    "making use of ( [ h_tot1 ] ) , we obtain the adiabatic gap as a function of time in the range @xmath160 @xmath161 ^{2}+8\\tau ^{2}\\left| \\left ( h_{p}\\right ) _ { g , e}\\right| ^{2 } } ,   \\label{pert_1}\\ ] ] here we explicitely take into account that the first excited level of @xmath40 is twofold degenerate",
