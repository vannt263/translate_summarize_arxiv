    "quantum information science studies the information transmission and processing capabilities of quantum mechanical systems .",
    "it is now well established that quantum mechanical devices can in principle outperform classical ones in these two settings .",
    "the physical realization of such schemes , however , relies on our ability to cope with imperfect noisy systems .",
    "the theory of quantum error correction ( qec ) and its fault - tolerant implementation  @xcite shows that this challenge is surmountable .",
    "the vast majority of studies of qec and fault - tolerance has focused on small size block codes encoding one or very few qubits , and concatenation thereof .",
    "noticeable exceptions are topological codes @xcite ( that have a vanishing rate ) , convolutional codes @xcite , low density parity check ( ldpc ) codes @xcite , and turbo - codes @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty with small block qec codes is that in order to achieve high error suppression , each logical qubit needs to be encoded in a very large number of physical qubits ( the encodings are of low rates ) .",
    "this overhead poses an extra technical challenge for the design of practical quantum information processors . in classical coding theory ,",
    "it is well known that smaller overheads can be achieved by encoding multiple bits in a single large block .",
    "in fact , random codes on @xmath0 bits typically achieve the shannon capacity in terms of maximum rate at vanishing error probability as @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "the drawback , however , is that in general these codes can not be decoded efficiently , i.e. , computing the optimal recovery given an error syndrome is an np - complete problem .",
    "two approaches can be pursued to overcome the decoding problem .",
    "algebraic codes ( e.g. reed - solomon codes @xcite , bose - chaudhuri - hocquenghem codes @xcite ) are designed to have large minimal distances and efficient minimal distance decoders .",
    "their construction relies on the structure of finite - field algebra , and they come an infinite variety of rates and minimal distances .",
    "algebraic codes have been investigated in the quantum setting , e.g. @xcite .",
    "as argued e.g. in @xcite however , due to their strict focus on the minimal distance , these codes are bound to fall short of the shannon limit .",
    "they are on the other hand unequaled for channels with burst errors , and have therefore found numerous commercial applications .",
    "the other approach is probabilistic coding ( e.g. , low density parity check [ ldpc ] codes , turbo - codes ) which differs from algebraic coding in three important aspects .",
    "firstly , the codes are chosen at random from a specified ensemble , and one is interested in the typical behavior over the ensemble .",
    "secondly , minimum distance decoding is typically a hard problem on these code ensembles .",
    "this leads to the third important distinction which is a shift of focus from minimal distance to the average performance of the code ensemble under ( sub - optimal ) polynomial - time decoding .",
    "for some common classical channels , state - of - the - art probabilistic codes are near - capacity achieving . the randomness involved in the code design yields good codes while the structure imposed on",
    "the code ensemble is sufficient to ensure good decoding performances .",
    "probabilistic codes have also been investigated in the quantum context @xcite .",
    "probabilistic codes are decoded by means of a belief propagation ( bp ) algorithm ( also known as sum - product , message passing , viterbi algorithm , bahl - cocke - jenilek - raviv algorithm depending on context ) .",
    "bp is a highly parallel general - purpose algorithm to solve ( or approximate the solution to ) inference problems involving large number of random variables located at the vertices of a graph , where the edges of the graph encode dependency between the random variables @xcite .",
    "when the graph is a tree , bp produces the exact solution to the inference problem in a time bounded by the tree s depth .",
    "more importantly , bp has proven to be a good heuristic method in cases where it is not known to converge , and particularly when the typical size of the loops in the graph is large .",
    "recently , a generalization of bp was proposed to solve inference problems involving a large number of _ quantum _ systems @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that decoding a stabilizer qec code on any memoryless quantum channel reduces to a quantum inference problem on a ( generally loopy ) graph .",
    "sparse codes ( a.k.a .",
    "ldpc ) are designed to accomplish a good performance under bp decoding .",
    "they are obtained by imposing random linear constraints on codewords , with each constraint involving a small number of bits and similarly each bit being involved in a small number of constraints .",
    "the constraints can be represented by a tanner graph ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig : tanner ] ) . as a consequence of the sparseness of the constraints , the graph typically contains no or very few small loops .",
    "decoded with a bp algorithm , sparse codes are amongst the best known classical error correction codes .",
    "for this reason , it is desirable to generalize them to the quantum setting .",
    "a method due to calderbank , shor , and steane @xcite ( css ) enables the construction of qec codes from any pair of dual classical codes .",
    "this technique has been used extensively to design small block codes , and recently to design  hybrid \" ( small block flip , large block phase ) qec codes tailored for particular channels @xcite .",
    "one might expect the css construction to leverage the power of sparse codes to qec , but attempts in that direction have proven quite difficult @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle in the design of sparse css codes is that sparse classical codes  being good error - correcting codes  do not typically have sparse duals .",
    "thus , randomly generated sparse codes are inappropriate and more sophisticated generating techniques are required for their use in css constructions .    the duality condition  and , more generally , the commutation conditions imposed on any stabilizer codes , not just those obtained from the css construction  also poses two immediate complications for the decoding of sparse qec codes . on one hand",
    ", it implies that the graph representing a qec code must have weight-4 loops .",
    "this places bp decoding on a slippery slope . on the other hand ,",
    "when a classical code has a sparse dual code , it has by definition low weight errors .",
    "fortunately , errors that lie in the dual code act trivially on the encoded quantum information .",
    "any pair of errors that are related by an element of the dual code can not and need not be distinguished : they are both corrected by the same operation . these are called  degenerate errors \" and by definition the sparse quantum codes have many degenerate low - weight errors .",
    "the degeneracy is a feature that generally improves the performance of qec codes @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , bp does not exploit the degeneracy of the code and even worse , it is typically impaired by degeneracy .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to describe why degeneracy compromises bp decoding .",
    "then , in an attempt to alleviate this problem , we propose heuristic techniques to partially overcome the aforementioned obtacles .",
    "our proposed techniques yields significant improvements over standard bp decoding for the cases considered here .",
    "we note , however , that despite these improvements , our methods are in need of further development for achieving optimal performance in broad range of applications .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the necessary background on qec and set up some notation .",
    "[ sec : bp ] provides a detailed description of the bp algorithm as used for the decoding of sparse quantum codes .",

    "a qec code on @xmath0 qubits is a subspace @xmath1 of the hilbert space @xmath2 .",

    "of particular interest are codes whose stabilizer generators are ( up to a phase ) @xmath0-fold tensor products of @xmath6 pauli matrices @xmath7 and we will refer to such operators simply as pauli operators .",
    "they form a group @xmath8 called the pauli group .",

    "operators that commute with the stabilizers elements have the property of mapping the code space to itself , and are therefore called logical operators .",
    "the logical operators also form a group @xmath19 , the normalizer of @xmath15 in @xmath8 , which contains @xmath15 as a normal subgroup .",
    "the logical group is defined as @xmath20 and coincides with @xmath21 .    for notational convenience",
    ", we will henceforth omit the tensor product symbol when describing an element of @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , the element @xmath22 will simply be denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "alternatively , we use subscripts to identify the qubits that are acted upon by non - trivial pauli matrices . for the above example",
    ", we would write @xmath24 .",
    "the clifford group on @xmath0 qubits @xmath25 is composed of unitary matrices that map pauli operators to pauli operators  it is the normalizer of @xmath8 in @xmath26 .",
    "one may succinctly describe a qec code by a clifford matrix @xmath27 acting on @xmath0 qubits as follows .",
    "the stabilizer generators are @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "these operators clearly commute and are multiplicatively independent . from @xmath27",
    ", one can define the logical operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "these operators commute with elements of @xmath15 and obey @xmath33 and @xmath34 . with a slight abuse of notation",
    ", we will henceforth use @xmath35 to denote @xmath36 and its representation given above .",
    "the code is then the set of all states of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "it is also convenient to define a set of  pure errors \" by @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "these operators commute with each other and with the logical operators , and obey the commutations @xmath41 .",
    "the set @xmath42 is a canonical generating set for @xmath8 .",
    "a qec code can be represented by a decorated tanner graph .",
    "this is a bipartite graph @xmath43 with vertices @xmath44 where the subset of vertices @xmath45 represent the @xmath0 qubits , and the other subset @xmath46 represent the @xmath47 stabilizer generators , or checks .",
    "the graph has an edge @xmath48 if and only if check @xmath49 acts non - trivially on qubit @xmath50 , i.e. iff the @xmath50th component of @xmath51 differs from the identity .",
    "edge @xmath48 is decorated by the @xmath50th pauli matrix of check @xmath49 , see figure [ fig : tanner ] .",
    "when checks @xmath49 and @xmath52 both act non - trivially on at least two qubits in common , say @xmath50 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 will contain a 4-loop @xmath55 .    to avoid the presence of 4-loops , one could make sure that no pair of checks @xmath49 and @xmath52 act on more than one common qubits .",
    "the commutation condition between checks then implies that on that common qubit , @xmath49 and @xmath52 must have the same pauli matrix .",
    "this argument leads to the conclusion that every edge connected to qubit @xmath50 must carry the same decoration , say @xmath56 for concreteness .",
    "such a code , however , fails to detect the weight-1 error @xmath57 .",
    "this would not cause any problem if @xmath58 , but in this case , qubit @xmath50 factors out in the code space , and the code states are of the form @xmath59 for some @xmath60 that satisfy additional constraints .",
    "we thus arrive at the conclusion that the tanner graphs of qec codes must unavoidably contain 4-loops .",
    "an edge in the tanner graph is said to have qubit - degree @xmath61 , if it is connected to a qubit node of degree ( weight ) @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , it has check - degree @xmath61 , if it is connected to a check node of degree @xmath61 .",
    "a sparse quantum code has a tanner graph with qubit- and check - degree bounded by some constant independent of the number of encoded qubits .",
    "since the checks must obey the strict commutation relations , it has proven difficult to generate them pseudo - randomly as it is done for the classical sparse codes .",
    "more precisely , a degree distribution @xmath62 is a polynomial with nonnegative real coefficients satisfying @xmath63 . here",
    ", @xmath64 denotes the fraction of edges in a graph for nodes of degree @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote the fraction of edges of qubit - degree and check - degree @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "then , the degree distribution for the tanner graph is the pair @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath70 defines a code ensemble of rate @xmath71 .",
    "we note that , in the classical theory of ldpc codes , a typical code in that ensemble decoded with the simple bp decoder on the binary erasure channel with erasure probability @xmath72 shows successful performance if @xmath73 , for @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "in this article , the error model that we consider are pauli channels that have the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "it is clear from eq .   that the phase of pauli operators are irrelevant , so the sum should only be carried over the effective pauli group @xmath78 . but to keep the notation simple",

    "a memoryless pauli channel is one for which the probability factors as @xmath79 for all @xmath80 .",
    "a particularly relevant example is the depolarizing channel for which @xmath81 and @xmath82 for all @xmath50 , and for some depolarizing strength @xmath83 .",
    "once the @xmath0 qubits are prepared in a code state @xmath84 , they are sent through the channel and state @xmath85 is obtained by the receiver . to detect the possible errors at the receiver ,",
    "the stabilizer generators @xmath51 are measured and outcome @xmath86 , called the error syndrome , is obtained .",
    "the state @xmath87 is a statistical mixture of states @xmath88 for different @xmath89 .",
    "when the error @xmath90 that corrupted the register commutes with @xmath51 , the syndrome bit @xmath91 takes value + 1 because @xmath92 .",
    "when @xmath90 anti - commutes with @xmath51 on the other hand , we obtain @xmath93 , and hence , @xmath94 . thus , the error syndrome provides partial information about the error that has occurred during the transmission .",
    "of all the errors @xmath89 that could have corrupted the @xmath0 qubits , only those that obey a commutation relation with the generators of @xmath15 consistent with the error syndrome are to be considered after the measurements of the @xmath51 s . in other words , the probability distribution of the errors conditioned on error syndrome @xmath95 is @xmath96 one decoding technique consists in identifying the most likely error given the syndrome @xmath95 : @xmath97 since all elements of @xmath8 square to the identity ( up to an irrelevant phase ) , the information can then be corrected by applying @xmath98 to the register .",
    "we will see in the next section however that this is not the optimal decoding rule .",
    "the computationally difficult step in the above error correction scheme is the evaluation of @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , this problem is np - complete @xcite .",
    "thus , we will settle for a simpler task that consists of evaluating the qubit - wise most - likely error .",
    "for @xmath99 , let us define the marginal probabilities @xmath100 the qubit - wise most likely error is then @xmath101 in general , the marginal optimum @xmath102 needs not coincide with the global optimum @xmath98 .",

    "involves a sum over a number of terms exponential in @xmath0 .",
    "this is where belief propagation comes in handy .",
    ", make use of a classical bp algorithm . for arbitrary quantum channels ,",
    "a quantum bp algorithm was described in details in @xcite . ]",
    "this algorithm operates by sending messages along the edges of the tanner graph ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig : tanner ] ) .",
    "messages from qubit @xmath50 to check @xmath49 are denoted by @xmath104 and messages from check @xmath49 to qubit @xmath50 are denoted @xmath105 .",
    "messages received at and sent by qubit @xmath50 are probability distributions over @xmath106 . in other words , they are arrays of 4 positive numbers , one for each value @xmath107 and @xmath56 .",
    "we denote @xmath108 the neighbors of qubit @xmath50 , and define @xmath109 similarly .    to initialize the algorithm , each qubit sends out a message to its neighbors equal to its prior probability of error @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the probability entering in the definition of the memoryless channel . upon reception of these messages",
    ", each check sends out a message to its neighboring qubits given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes all neighbors of @xmath49 except @xmath50 .",
    "the sum is over all pauli operators on the neighbors of @xmath49 but with @xmath106 held fixed .",
    "the proportionality factor can be fixed by normalization @xmath114 .",
    "thus , @xmath115 is a function of the syndrome bit @xmath91 associated to check @xmath49 , and the messages @xmath116 received from all neighbors of @xmath49 , except @xmath50 .    upon reception of these messages , each qubit sends out a message to its neighboring checks given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 denotes all neighbors of @xmath50 except @xmath49 .",
    "again , the proportionality factor can be fixed by normalization .",
    "thus , @xmath104 is a function of the qubit prior probability @xmath111 , and the messages @xmath119 received from all neighbors of @xmath50 , except @xmath49 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : m_cq]-[eq : m_qc ] ) define an iterative procedure that is at the core of bp .",
    "the beliefs @xmath120  that are meant to represent an approximation to the marginal conditional probability @xmath121  are computed from the @xmath105 messages as follows @xmath122 the recovery can be chosen as the product of qubit - wise maximum - belief pauli matrices @xmath123 where @xmath124    when @xmath54 is a tree , the beliefs converge to the correct conditional marginals @xmath125 in a time equal to the tree s depth .",
    "thus , the qubit - wise most likely error can be computed efficiently .",
    "this leads , for instance , to an efficient maximum - likelihood decoding algorithm for concatenated quantum block codes @xcite .",
    "when the graph @xmath54 includes loops , the beliefs will not converge to the correct conditional marginals in general .",
    "nonetheless bp can be used as a heuristic method to approximate the solution to such intrinsically hard problems , and in many situations it is empirically observed to provide reliable solutions .",
    "apropos examples of successful loopy bp are provided by the near - capacity achieving decoding of classical ldpc and turbo - codes .    since loopy bp",
    "is not guaranteed to converge within any fixed number of iterations , one has to impose a halting criterion on the iterative procedure . here , we choose to halt when the correction given by the highest beliefs @xmath126 lead to a trivial error syndrome , i.e. , when @xmath127 for all @xmath128 .",
    "since this is not guaranteed to occur after any finite number of iterations , it is also necessary to impose a maximum number of iterations .",
    "as explained above , the output of the channel @xmath87 is a statistical mixture of states @xmath88 for different @xmath89 .",
    "note however that when @xmath129 for some operator @xmath130 , then @xmath131 by definition of code states .",
    "moreover , @xmath90 and @xmath132 have the same error syndrome since they differ by an element of @xmath15 , which by definition commute with all the generators @xmath51 .",
    "hence , errors @xmath90 and @xmath132 can not be distinguished .",
    "this is not a concern however because any recovery @xmath133 that reverses the effect of @xmath90 on the code space will also reverse the effect of @xmath132 @xmath134 in brief , the errors that are related by an element of @xmath15 _ can not _ and _ need not _ be distinguished by the error syndrome .",
    "this is the main feature of degeneracy in qec .",
    "since @xmath42 is a canonical generating set for @xmath8 , we can uniquely expand each error as @xmath135 where @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "note that @xmath139 is the only element of that decomposition that can anti - commute with the stabilizer generators .",
    "moreover every elements of @xmath140 has a distinct commutation relation with the @xmath51 , and hence a distinct syndrome .",
    "it follows that @xmath139 is entirely known given the error syndrome @xmath95 , and it is given by @xmath141 on the other hand , the value of @xmath142 is of no interest since that element of the decomposition acts trivially on @xmath1 .",
    "the only element left is @xmath143 , and it has conditional probability @xmath144 optimal decoding consists in identifying the most likely value for @xmath145 given @xmath95 @xmath146 this differs from the decoder defined at eq .   because @xmath147 is obtained from @xmath148 by quotienting @xmath8 by @xmath15 . in this sense ,",
    "qec codes are intrinsically coset codes .",
    "the degeneracy typically improves the performance of a code because many errors can be corrected in the same way , and need not be distinguished by the error syndrome .",
    "this becomes particularly relevant when many elements of @xmath15 have low weight since the degeneracy will then relate typical errors . to take advantage of this feature ,",
    "it is important to properly sum the probabilities over the cosets : the coset with the most likely error may differ from the most likely coset .",
    "however , the bp algorithm presented in the previous section uses eq .   as a starting point , and so completely ignores the coset structure of the code .",
    "this will lead to a decline of the scheme s performances , and should be particularly pronounced for sparse codes .    beyond these complications",
    ", the degeneracy is expected to cause extra complications when used with any qubit - wise maximum - likelihood decoder such as bp .",
    "this is due to the presence of symmetries in the code that are reflected in the decoder , but broken by the channel .",
    "the next section aims at illustrating this issue .",
    "we consider a particularly simple qec code that encodes zero qubits ( a single state ) into two qubits .",
    "it has stabilizer generators @xmath149 and @xmath150 , and code space @xmath151 .",
    "suppose these qubits are sent through a depolarization channel , and that error @xmath152 is applied .",
    "measurement of the stabilizer generators reveal the error syndrome @xmath153 .",
    "this error can be corrected by either of the operations @xmath154 , @xmath152 , @xmath155 , or @xmath156 . because of the symmetry of the code however , the marginal conditional probabilities eq .",
    "are identical on both qubits , @xmath157 . since none of the correct recoveries have this symmetry , any decoding scheme based on qubit - wise probabilities will fail with this very simple code .",
    "figure  [ fig : loop ] a ) shows the beliefs obtained from the bp algorithm as a function of the number of iterations . due to the symmetry of the code , the beliefs on qubit 1 and 2 are identical .",
    "as we see , the identity is always assigned the largest belief , and hence , the bp decoder will recommend correcting the error by doing nothing .",
    "this is , of course , incorrect .",
    "in fact , this correction will result in a  detected error \" because there will remain a non - trivial syndrome after applying the recommended recovery . in that case",
    ", our bp algorithm would iterate until it reaches the maximum number of iterations imposed by hand , and would output the correction @xmath158 knowing that it is an incorrect inference .",
    "in fact , the decoder can not possibly succeed because it always assigns identical beliefs to qubits 1 and 2 , but none of the appropriate corrections listed above have that symmetry .",
    "the optimal decoder must add the probability of @xmath154 and @xmath152 , and assign the result to either one of them ; this choice is not important and can be made at random .",
    "this is not incorporated in the standard bp scheme because @xmath154 and @xmath152 are symmetric in all aspects . to achieve any improvement in the bp decoding , it is essential to break this symmetry .",
    "while the example of the previous section may appear naive and contrived , it actually captures a universal feature of sparse quantum codes : they have many degenerate typical errors , and the degenerate errors of equal weight are completely symmetric under bp decoding .",
    "one needs to break this symmetry in order to overcome the difficulty explained in the previous section .",
    "we have investigated a host of different techniques to improve the performance of sparse quantum codes under bp decoding . here , we present the most successful ones .    in all cases ,",
    "the general structure of the bp algorithm is unaltered . at each round of iteration ,",
    "new beliefs are obtained and the maximum - belief correction @xmath126 is evaluated .",
    "if @xmath126 restores a trivial syndrome , the algorithm halts with output @xmath126 . if , on the other hand , the procedures reaches a pre - determined fixed number of iterations @xmath159 without satisfying the halting conditions , a perturbation will be applied in order to break any symmetry that may be responsible for the impasse .",
    "the different techniques we have explored differ in the choice of the symmetry breaking .",
    "the presence of small loops in the tanner graph turns out to be crucial because it rapidly propagates the symmetry breaking perturbation to all the qubits involved in the degenerate error .",
    "the first technique consists of  freezing \" one of the qubits involved in an unsatisfied check .",
    "we first find a frustrated check @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath160 .",
    "we pick a random qubit @xmath50 connected to that check , and freeze its prior probability to @xmath161 .",
    "we let the bp iterate with this modified prior for @xmath159 steps .",
    "if it halts during this period we are done .",
    "if @xmath49 is still frustrated , we restore the probability of @xmath50 and freeze a different qubit @xmath53 involved in @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath49 is not frustrated but the halting condition is not satisfied , we find another frustrated check @xmath52 and freeze one of its qubits at random .",
    "when applied to the above example , the random freezing technique immediately solves the problem . if for instance we set @xmath162 , we obtain after a single iteration @xmath163 and @xmath164 , hence the correction @xmath165 .",
    "the second technique consists in randomly perturbing the prior probability associated to qubits involved in frustrated checks .",
    "we simply identify the frustrated checks @xmath49 , and for each @xmath50 in @xmath109 we apply the perturbation ( up to normalization ) @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are random variables distributed uniformly in the range @xmath169 $ ] for some fixed @xmath72 .",
    "the goal of this perturbation is to create an asymmetry among the qubits that will put an end to the impasse .",
    "it is clear that the perturbation needs to be random in order to break the symmetry : if the error probability is equally increased on all unsatisfied checks the problem would persist .",
    "it also seems intuitive to move to a prior with strictly stronger error probability because at least one of the qubits connected to @xmath49 definitely has an error .",
    "this choice is also justified by the fact that for the vast majority of decoding errors , the decoder had identified the identity operator as the most likely error . in other words , we have empirically observed that the decoder is naturally too biased towards the identity .    when applied to the toy model of the previous section , a random perturbation produced exactly the effect we were hoping for , as long as the perturbation creates a sufficiently strong asymmetry between @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "an example illustrates this point on fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] b)-c ) .",
    "the collision trick is an attempt to enforce the analogy between real decoding instances and the simple model presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:2qubits ] .",
    "it operates in conjunction with other symmetry breaking techniques .",
    "it proceeds by finding a colliding pair of unsatisfied checks @xmath49 and @xmath52 , such that both @xmath172 and @xmath173 , and @xmath49 and @xmath52 share some qubits in common .",
    "typically , @xmath49 and @xmath52 will have two qubits in common . under the assumption that the non - trivial syndromes @xmath91 and @xmath174 have a common cause",
    " i.e. that they are due to error on their common qubits  the situation reduces exactly to that of sec .  [ sec:2qubits ] .",
    "thus , we can apply a random perturbation to those qubits , or choose to freeze one of them .",
    "it is also possible to further exploit the labels of the checks on each qubits to determine the local degeneracy structure of the code .",
    "we illustrate the performances of our decoding algorithms with a bicycle sparse quantum code  @xcite used over a depolarizing channel . we have applied our decoding algorithms to a number of other codes ; in all cases we have found that our heuristic methods yield an improvement over the standard bp decoder but the best performances were obtained from the bicycle codes .",
    "bicycle codes  @xcite are css codes that make use of cyclic matrices . a simple method to create a @xmath175 cyclic binary matrix @xmath176 consists of generating a binary column vector @xmath177 of length @xmath178 with random entries and defining @xmath179 .",
    "a sparse cyclic matrix is obtained when the vector @xmath177 is sparse .    for a bicycle code with row - weight @xmath180 , block length @xmath0 and number of checks @xmath47 ,",
    "first generate a random @xmath181 cyclic matrix @xmath176 with row weight @xmath182 .",
    "( as in @xcite , this matrix can be constructed from a difference set , but the construction outline above seems to work just as well . ) then , construct a matrix @xmath183 by merging the matrices @xmath176 and @xmath184 , i.e. , @xmath185 .",
    "this matrix is self - dual : @xmath186 deleting @xmath187 of the rows from @xmath188 yields a self - dual matrix @xmath189 with @xmath190 rows and @xmath0 columns .",
    "this matrix is used in the css construction to obtain a code of rate @xmath191 with checks given by @xmath192 the commutativity of the checks follows from the self - duality of @xmath193 .",
    "the construction of bicycle codes has complete freedom in controlling the size and weight of the code .",
    "however , all the deleted rows of @xmath183 are low - weight codewords which are unlikely to lie in the dual . hence , while they offer good performances under bp decoding on the depolarization channel , bicycle codes most likely have a small minimal distance ( less or equal to @xmath180 ) .    the most successful methods for improving the iterative decoding performances are freezing ( sec .  [ sec : freeze ] ) combined with the method of colliding checks ( sec .",

    "our results obtained for bicycle codes are shown at fig .",
    "[ fig : bc ] . both symmetry breaking techniques yield a 10 db gain over the basic bp decoder at depolarizing strength 0.01 for the bicycle codes .",

    "11 of ref .",
    "results obtained from larger blocks exhibit overall better performances , but the improvement due to the modified bp decoding are more pronounced on smaller blocks for the range of error probabilities accessible through monte carlo simulations .",
    "note that there are two distinct types of failed error corrections , depending on whether @xmath197 or not . in the former case ,",
    "the error is undetected because it corresponds to a codeword .",
    "these errors can generally be attributed to fundamental limitations of the code . in the latter case",
    ", it is known that the decoder has failed because the syndrome after the correction procedure remains non - trivial .",
    "such a _ detected error _ indicates a failure of the decoder . despite the improvements yielded by our heuristic methods , in all the cases we have investigated , 100@xmath198 of the errors were detected errors",
    "this indicates that the major obstacle to good quantum coding schemes remains in the decoding .",
    "the only exceptions were the codes presented in @xcite , that we found to contain many weight-6 codewords .",
    "in this paper , we have explained how the high degeneracy of sparse quantum codes will typically impair their performance under belief propagation decoding .",
    "based on a simple model , we have proposed some heuristic techniques to partially overcome this problem .",
    "our numerical results show that these techniques provide a clear and substantial improvement of the coding scheme s performance , which indirectly corroborates our model .    despite these efforts",
    ", we found that the greatest challenge still remains in the decoding .",
    "indeed , all the errors found in our simulations could be attributed to the decoder rather than the finite minimal distance of the code .",
