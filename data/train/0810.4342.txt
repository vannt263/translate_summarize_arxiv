    "@xmath54 , @xmath51 , and @xmath2 are mediated entirely by intercarrier collisions .",
    "the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath53 can be obtained from measurement of the bulk conductivity ( at variable doping ) , or the combined measurement of the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath323 and the thermopower @xmath324 , in the limit of a long device with @xmath57 .",

    "we have given general formulae for both @xmath3 and @xmath47 at arbitrary doping and device size @xmath9 , incorporating the effects of non - ideal contacts .",
    "non - ideal contacts allow exchange of carriers with the graphene , providing an alternate route for imbalance relaxation .",
    "we have explicated the various crossover regimes that separate the zero imbalance relaxation ( short device ) and infinite relaxation ( long device ) limiting behaviors .    in this paper , we have neglected the effects of phonons in graphene .",

    ", however , the za dispersion also becomes linear.@xcite    because the acoustic phonon velocities@xcite @xmath326 m / s @xmath327 , the electron - hole pair creation and annihilation processes @xmath328 are kinematically forbidden .",
    "therefore the electron - phonon scattering does not contribute to the imbalance relaxation , at least to lowest order .",
