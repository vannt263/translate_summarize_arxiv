    "recently , the relativistic beth - uhlenbeck ( bu ) approach for two - particle correlations in two - flavor quark matter within the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite and the polyakov - loop improved njl ( pnjl ) model @xcite has appeared as a promising candidate for a unified description of hadron and quark - gluon matter . in particular , the description of correlations in deconfined quark matter , sometimes denoted as `` bound states above @xmath5 '' @xcite , with @xmath5 being the pseudocritical temperature of the chiral and deconfinement crossover transitions , is naturally achieved within this formulation . attempts to formulate a unified thermodynamics of the hadron - to - quark - gluon matter transition have been made in postulating a spectral function for hadrons across the chiral / deconfinement transition @xcite .    in order to reach this description , however , there are a few more important steps to be made",
    ". one of them is the inclusion of the strangeness degree of freedom . we devote the present work to this aim , restricting ourselves to the case of the lightest hadron channels only , the pseudoscalar @xmath1 and @xmath6 mesons and their chiral partner states , the corresponding scalar mesons .",
    "as is widely known , the njl model is capable of describing the chiral restoration transition in a hot and dense medium , where the dynamically generated quark masses drop as a function of temperature and chemical potentials , thus restoring the mass degeneracy of the chiral partner states . at the same time , the continuum thresholds for quark - antiquark scattering channels drop , which results in a lowering of the binding energy for the pseudoscalar meson bound states and finally in their dissociation when they enter the continuum and change their character to resonances with a finite lifetime ( mott effect ) .",
    "this aspect of the mott dissociation is usually identified by mass poles for mesons becoming complex , with the real part being the `` mass '' @xmath7 of the resonance @xmath8 and the imaginary part being related to a finite width @xmath9 due to its decay into the quark constituents .",
    "the phase shift of these states is well described by a breit - wigner function as long as @xmath10 .    following previous works on the bu approach to pion dissociation in quark matter in the njl @xcite and pnjl @xcite models , we point out that the breit - wigner description is not complete as it neglects the fact that analytic properties of continuum states ( resonances or just scattering states ) are properly described by jost functions , defined along the cut for continuum states in the complex energy plane .",
    "this fact is most appropriately taken into account by the introduction of a scattering phase shift function for each mesonic channel @xmath11 , which depends on the squared center - of - mass energy @xmath12 in the quark - antiquark system and thermodynamic parameters of the medium , here the temperature @xmath13 and chemical potentials @xmath14 and @xmath15 for light and strange quarks , respectively .",
    "the behaviour of the phase shift at the threshold can be used as an indicator for the mott transition of a bound state to the scattering state continuum .",
    "the phase shift vanishes at infinity , while it has a value of @xmath1 at the continuum threshold as long as there is a bound state below the continuum .",
    "when the bound state merges with the scattering states continuum , the phase shift jumps to zero , in accordance with the levinson theorem .    a striking advantage of the bu approach over phenomenological models like @xcite is the formulation of the thermodynamics of correlations in terms of phase shift functions that are in accordance with the levinson theorem @xcite , which guarantees that the partial pressure of correlations vanishes at asymptotic temperatures ( and chemical potentials ) .",
    "it may be understood as an anticipation of asymptotic freedom for strong , finite range interactions @xcite .    as a result , within the present approach the eos and thermodynamic properties ( like the composition ) of the system of hadrons ,",
    "quarks and gluons can be described with the correct asymptotics of the hadron gas ( of pions and kaons ) at low temperatures and the quark - gluon plasma at high temperatures , with the transition in - between .",
    "a quantitative comparison with lattice qcd thermodynamics data is premature at this stage of the development of the bu approach , mainly due to the lack of hadronic states and missing self - consistency .",
    "it is therefore deferred to a future stage of work .",
    "in this work we investigate thermodynamic properties of quark - gluon - meson matter for the pnjl model with @xmath16 quark flavors , where the strange chemical potential is fixed to @xmath17 as motivated by statistical model analyses of chemical freeze - out parameters for describing hadron production in heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "we study the temperature dependence of quark and meson masses along lines of constant @xmath18 in the @xmath13-@xmath19 plane which are seen as approximations to lines of constant entropy per baryon along which the hydrodynamic evolution of the heavy - ion collision shall proceed .",
    "the eos for pressure versus temperature in the beth - uhlenbeck approach is evaluated for @xmath20 , whereby the quark , gluon and meson contribution to the total pressure is given .",
    "special emphasis is on the mott dissociation of the pseudoscalar meson states which is illustrated by the behaviour of the corresponding phase shifts as functions of energy for different temperatures and chemical potentials .",
    "the corresponding scalar meson states are unbound already in the vacuum , as is characteristic for the local pnjl model .",
    "nevertheless one can observe how at high temperatures and chemical potentials the chiral partner states become degenerate in their analytic properties as encoded by the phase shifts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : partition ] we outline the path integral approach to the partition function of the 2 + 1 flavor pnjl model , including mesonic fluctuations beyond the meanfield in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels in gaussian approximation . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results for the phase diagram and for the temperature dependence of the order parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 as well as the meson mass spectra , the energy dependent phase shifts and the pressure with its contributions from quarks , gluons and mesons along a set of trajectories of constant @xmath18 in the phase diagram . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we present the conclusions of this study .",

    "the scalar - pseudoscalar meson interaction channels in ( 1 ) are color singlet and fulfill the requirement of being chirally symmetric .",
    "thus , only the diagonal matrix of current quark masses @xmath34 induces an explicit breaking of the otherwise global symmetry of the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) .",

    "this model provides a field - theoretic description of pseudoscalar meson properties which is in accordance with the low energy theorems of qcd , such as the goldstone theorem .",
    "this is achieved by considering the ( gaussian ) fluctuations above the mean field in the scalar and pseudoscalar meson sector and analysing their properties as encoded in the matrix elements of the polarization operator which after analytic continuation from the bosonic matsubara frequencies to the real @xmath45 axis reads @xcite    @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 for @xmath48 denoting the pseudoscalar meson states and @xmath49 the scalar meson states . here",

    "the quark - antiquark correlations in scalar and pseudoscalar channels are accounted for by the corresponding phase shifts as solutions of the bethe - salpeter equations for the meson propagators .",
    "the notion of the phase shifts is generalized such as to display both the bound and scattering states spectrum with their characteristic medium effects .",
    "most prominently this concerns the mott transition where the bound state transforms to a resonance in the continuum .",
    "this transition manifests itself in the vanishing of the binding energy as a consequence of the lowering of the continuum edge of scattering states due to chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "it appears as a jump of the phase shift at threshold by @xmath1 in accordance with the levinson theorem .",
    "thus the mesonic pressure expressed in the bu form reflects this mott dissociation effect . while the quark and gluon contribution to the total pressure is increased towards the stefan - boltzmann limit above the chiral restoration , the mesonic contribution to the pressure dies out .",

    "the absolute value of the temperature for which the pressure starts rising towards the stefan - boltzmann limit is well above the one obtained in lattice qcd .",

    "the so - called `` entanglement '' pnjl model has been suggested to cure this problem @xcite by modifying the scalar coupling by a function of the traced polyakov loop @xmath168 .",
    "another improvement of the pnjl model concerns its nonlocal generalization which not only provides a solution to the problem of the pseudocritical temperature absolute value @xcite , but also describes the running of the quark mass and the wave function renormalization of the quark propagator , in very close agreement with lattice qcd simulations at @xmath169 @xcite . at high temperatures , lattice qcd thermodynamics",
    "does not approach the massless stefan - boltzmann limit but rather a modified one which is well decribed by thermal masses in the two - loop approximation to the thermodynamic potential , see @xcite and references therein . in the transition region , it is a matter of a detailed quantitative comparison , how many more hadronic resonances might be of relevance for a satisfactory description of the lattice qcd data .",
    "it is clear that for very low temperatures and finite baryon densities the inclusion of baryonic states is customary .",
    "then the eos constraints from compact star phenomenology and heavy - ion collisions @xcite shall be the guideline for the model development where lattice qcd data are absent .",
