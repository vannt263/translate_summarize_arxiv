    "at early galactic times , the main contributors to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium were presumably the most massive and shortest - lived stars .",
    "their resulting core collapse supernovae explosions of type  ii ( `` sne  ii '' ; and to a lesser extent , sne  ib and sne  ic ) , enriched the medium in @xmath1-elements ( eg .  0 , ne , mg , si , ca ) and odd - z elements ( eg .  na , al , p ) , among others .",
    "neutron - rich sites , presumably associated with the core collapse supernovae , contributed additional elements produced in rapid neutron - capture nucleosynthesis ( `` @xmath8-process '' ; eg .",
    "eu ) . evolving more slowly , lower mass stars began contributing their ejecta to the medium at later galactic times , first adding those isotopes produced in slow neutron - capture nucleosynthesis ( `` @xmath9-process '' ; eg .",
    "sr , ba ) and then later , fe - peak nuclei via supernovae type  ia ( `` sne  ia '' ) explosions .",
    "the stage in galactic evolution at which sne  ia began to contribute is not known precisely . however , an overall galactic trend in the lowering of the [ @xmath1/fe]-ratio at about [ fe / h ] @xmath10 1 is associated with the increase in fe due to sne  ia contributions ( eg .  tinsley 1979 , pagel & tautvaisiene 1995 , their figure  3 ) .",
    "a number of studies have discovered stars of intermediately low metallicities that also possess relatively low [ @xmath1/fe ] , [ na / fe ] , and/or neutron - capture element abundance ratios when compared to stars of comparable metallicities ( with differences in the range of 0.1  0.6  dex ) .",
    "the studies include the outer halo star bd+6  855 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath10 0.7 ; carney & latham 1985 ) ; a sample of high velocity stars ( 1.3 @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath5 0.4 ; nissen & schuster 1997 ; `` ns97 '' ) ; the outer halo common proper motion pair hd134439/40 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath10 1.5 ; king 1997 ) ; and the relatively young outer halo clusters pal  12 and rup  106 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath10 1 and 1.4 , respectively ; brown et al 1997 ) .",
    "the abundances and kinematics of all of these objects are consistent with the idea of accretion events in the outer halo .",
    "studies encompassing larger samples of halo stars have found that the average [ @xmath1/fe]-ratio is lower for stars with higher - than - average space velocities ( fulbright 2002 ) and for stars with orbits that take them to the outer halo ( stephens & boesgaard 2002 ) .",
    "these kinematically extreme stars may have formed at large distances from the galactic center in either localized star - forming regions or in proto - galactic fragments which were later assimilated into the milky way .",
    "recently , there have been a few serendipitous discoveries of low - metallicity stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath10 2 ) that exhibit anomalously low abundances of @xmath1-elements ( in some cases , over 1 dex lower than is exhibited in halo stars of comparable metallicities that follow the general trend of an overall @xmath1-enhancement ) .",
    "bd+80  245 ( carney et al 1997 ) , g4 - 36 ( james 1998 , 2000 ) , and bps  cs22966 - 043 ( preston & sneden 2000 ) all exhibit similar under - abundances in their [ @xmath1/fe]-ratios and are also deficient in the abundance of neutron - capture elements . in our analysis , we studied these stars as a group , expanding the number of elemental abundances , and explored the idea that the elemental abundance ratio diminishments in these stars are the results of iron enhancements from sne  ia contributions .      in our analysis , we confirm the previous reports of the unusual nature of these stars , and expand the number of elements studied .",
    "all three objects possess anomalously low light-@xmath1- and odd - z element abundances with respect to stars of comparable metallicities , as well as low abundances of sr and ba ( by almost 2  dex in the case of bd+80  245 ) .",
    "we find , however , that the low-@xmath1 stars do not share the same behaviour in the abundances of fe - peak elements .",
    "bd+80  245 exhibits slightly low fe - peak abundances with respect to iron ( 0.2  0.3  dex ) , whereas g4 - 36 and cs22966 - 043 are significantly enhanced ( up to 0.5  0.7  dex ) relative to the scaled solar metallicity .",
    "table  [ table1 ] displays the abundances we derived for our stars , as well as the mean of the halo in the metallicity range of 1.75 @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath5 2.25 . as can be seen in this table , as well as in figure  [ figure1 ] , the elemental abundances of our low-@xmath1 stars are very dissimilar to those found in the general halo population .",
    "further details of the observational material and abundance analysis are described in ivans et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "table notes and references : + ( 1 ) derived from fits of stellar abundances to published sne  ii and sne  ia yields ( as tabulated in iwamoto et al 1999 ; their table 3 ) . + ( 2 ) derived from fits of stellar abundances to published sne  ii ( as tabulated in iwamoto et al 1999 ; their table 3 ) and sne  ia yields ( from the hflich group ) .",

    "does the variation in derived @xmath7 improve over those of standard sne  ii .",
    "we also rederived the @xmath7 ratios for our low-@xmath1 stars employing yields of the full range of sne  ib and sne  ic models calculated by woosley et al ( 1995 ) .",
    "we attempted to employ their yields to our abundance ratios both by treating the sne  ib and sne  ic models as alternatives to the sne  ii yields , and by treating them as alternatives to the sne ia yields . in neither case",
    "could we obtain satisfactory agreement among the abundances for any of our stars .",
    "we find that the unusual abundances of our stellar trio can not be explained by the hypernova models of umeda & nomoto or by the sne  ib or sne  ic models of woosley et al .",
    "we explored the possibility that the source of the abundance anomalies in our stars may be the result of something other than sne  ia - enhanced material .",
    "the details are presented in ivans et al ( 2003 ) but , in summary , we find we can not explain the abundances by invoking binarity and mass transfer ; formation from agb - enriched material ; or chemically stratified atmospheres .",
    "the supernovae ratios we derived do not allow us to distinguish between the possibility that our stars formed from material enriched in sne  ia yields and the possibility that our stars were born from much less chemically enriched material at earlier times and nearby sne  ia events occurring at later times deposited fe nuclei on the surfaces of our stars .",
    "however , the ratios of the abundances of the neutron - capture elements suggest that the latter possibility is less likely .    _",
    "while it is possible that the atmospheres do not represent the interstellar material out of which they were born , and instead exhibit the effects of pollution from some other source , no potential contributor has been observed that displays abundances similar to those we derive .",
    "_      evidence of chemical substructure in the galactic halo is seen in the elemental abundances of bd+80  245 , g4 - 36 , and cs22966 - 043 .",
    "these stars were all serendipitously discovered as having low @xmath1-element and neutron - capture element abundances in the context of previous studies . in our study , we confirm the earlier reports and expand the number of elements for which abundances have been derived in these stars .",
    "we find that the mean abundance ratio for [ ( mg , si , ca)/fe ] is @xmath0 0.7  dex below the mean of halo stars of comparable metallicities and that the mean abundance ratio for [ ( sr , ba)/fe ] is @xmath0 a full dex below the halo mean .",
    "our low-@xmath1 stars do not display uniform abundances of the fe - peak nuclei with respect to the abundance of iron .",
    "bd+80  245 exhibits diminishments whereas g4 - 36 and cs22966 - 043 present mild to pronounced over - abundances of these elements .",
    "the latter two stars require such large ga enhancements to synthesize the observed spectra that it is possible , for the first time , to report ga abundances in any metal - poor star .",
    "we explore the idea that the elemental abundance ratios in these stars can be explained by iron enhancements from sne  ia contributions .",
    "we derive 0.18 @xmath4 0.01 @xmath5 @xmath7 @xmath5 0.25 @xmath4 0.06 for the sun , which is in good agreement with values found in the literature for galactic ratios of supernovae type ii to type ia events . the results for our low-@xmath1 trio confirm the idea that the low @xmath1- and low neutron - capture element abundances can be explained by a larger contribution of sne  ia yields than went into the average halo star : 0.6 @xmath2 @xmath5 @xmath7 @xmath5 1.3 .",
    "thus , given the metallicities of our stars , it would appear that bd+80  245 , g4 - 36 , and cs22966 - 043 may have formed from the material polluted by the earliest of sne  ia events .",
    "however , our derivations were limited to a small subset of the observed abundances .",
    "the unusual abundance ratios of ti , cr , mn , ni , and zn ( among other elements ) can not be modelled using existing supernova model yields .",
    "additional questions which we would like to explore are the determination of the sne  ia progenitors , and whether the progenitors or scenarios have changed over galactic timescales",
    ". to our knowledge , an identification or determination of sne  ia progenitors based on the observed chemical abundances of metal - poor stars does not exist in the literature .",
    "the three low-@xmath1 stars represent a non - negligible part of early galactic nucleosynthesis , yet are not explained by current galactic evolution models .",
