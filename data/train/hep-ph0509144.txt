    "<S> we investigate the possible corrections to the linear regge trajectories for the light - quark meson sector by matching two - point correlators of quark currents to the operator product expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the allowed modifications to the linear behavior must decrease rapidly with the principal quantum number . after fitting the lightest states in each channel and certain low - energy constants the whole spectrum for meson masses and residues </S>",
    "<S> is obtained in a satisfactory agreement with phenomenology . the perturbative corrections to our results </S>",
    "<S> are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed masses squared of mesons with given quantum numbers form linear trajectories  @xcite depending on the number of radial excitation @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a strong indication that qcd admits an effective string description , as this type of spectrum is characteristic e.g. of the bosonic string . in the bosonic string model </S>",
    "<S> the slope of all trajectories must be equal since this quantity is proportional to the string tension depending on gluedynamics only . </S>",
    "<S> however , there exist sizeable deviations from the string picture . in the present analysis we examine possible corrections to the linear trajectories in the vector  ( v ) , axial - vector  ( a ) , scalar  ( s ) , and pseudoscalar  ( p ) channels  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our method is based on the consideration of the two - point correlators of v , a , s , p quark currents in the large-@xmath1 limit of qcd  @xcite . on the one hand , by virtue of confinement </S>",
    "<S> they are saturated by an infinite set of narrow meson resonances , that is , they can be represented by the sum of related meson poles in euclidean space : @xmath2 expressing the quark - hadron duality@xcite . here @xmath3 ; @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> further we denote @xmath5 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> their high - energy asymptotics is provided by the perturbation theory and the operator product expansion ( ope ) with condensates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> matching these two approaches results in the chiral symmetry restoration sum rules representing a set of constraints on meson mass parameters  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we performed the further analysis in the chiral limit and firstly in the leading order of perturbation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the linear ansatz for the meson mass spectra with a non - linear correction @xmath6 : @xmath7 the last term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ acor1 ] ) signifies a possible deviation from the string picture in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the condition of convergence for the generalized weinberg sum rules  @xcite imposes the equality of slopes and a falloff of non - linear correction .    </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic freedom leads to the relation between residues and masses : @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis showed that the analytical structure of the ope admits , however , exponentially small deviations from this relation ( in contrast to to  @xcite ) , @xmath9 with certain constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 to be fitted . </S>",
    "<S> it is plausible to suppose that , for masses , the dynamics under these exponentially small corrections is governed mostly by gluons and thereby does not depend on flavor . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we keep the exponent @xmath12 the same for all channels . for the same reason we regard @xmath13 as independent of parity .    in tables 1 and 2 </S>",
    "<S> we show an example of numerical fits resulting from our approach where in the s , p - channels two possibilities are considered : @xmath14-meson belongs to the radial regge trajectory ( @xmath14-in ) and does not ( @xmath14-out ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inputs general for all tables ( if any ) are : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the units are : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23  mev ; @xmath24  mev@xmath25 ; @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28  mev@xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss the impact of running coupling constant at next - to - leading order of perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we have in this case the contribution to the imaginary part of correlator which is related to the full correlator through the dispersion relation . in the large-@xmath1 limit for the vector and axial - vector case </S>",
    "<S> this leads to : @xmath30 we perform summation in eq . by applying the euler - maclaurin summation formula </S>",
    "<S> this provides smoothness of this expression . </S>",
    "<S> finally we obtain the relation : @xmath31    eq . </S>",
    "<S> can be approximated by finite differences . </S>",
    "<S> for the first two states this reads : @xmath32 substituting experimental values @xcite into eq . </S>",
    "<S> one arrives at the estimate : @xmath33 in a good agreement with the phenomenology .    in order to reproduce the running coupling behaviour in eq . </S>",
    "<S> one should accept the following ansatz for the residues : @xmath34 however this ansatz introduces into the ope the additional terms @xmath35 ( and powers of these terms ) which are absent in the standart ope . </S>",
    "<S> thus ansatz must be improved . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is under our studies now .    </S>",
    "<S> let us summarize the results of our analysis : + * 1 ) * the convergence of the generalized weinberg sum rules requires the universality of slopes and intercepts for parity conjugated trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> + * 2 ) * the matching to the ope can not be achieved by a simple linear parameterization of the mass spectrum , the linear trajectory ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> there must exist deviations from the linear trajectory ansatz triggered by chiral symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> these deviations must decrease at least exponentially with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> + * 3 ) * for heavy states , the d - wave vector mesons have to decouple from asymptotic sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> this fact implies the exponential ( or faster ) decreasing the corresponding decay constants @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> + * 4 ) * our results seem to exclude a light @xmath37 particle as a quarkonium state and rather favor the non - linear realization of chiral symmetry with the lightest scalar of mass @xmath38 gev , its chiral partner being the @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> + * 5 ) * in our approach the quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41 are obtained , in satisfactory agreement with the phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> + * 6 ) * perturbative corrections can be systematically treated making , nevertheless , small effects on the fits presented . </S>"
