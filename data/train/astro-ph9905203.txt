    "gravitational lenses have turned out to be ideal sites for obtaining estimates of several cosmological quantities , such as the content of the universe ( see , for example , i m et al .",
    "1997 ) or the hubble constant .",
    "refsdal ( 1964a , b ) first demonstrated that a determination of @xmath9 could be obtained from the time delay between two components of a multiply - imaged quasar and an estimate of the distribution of mass in the deflector .",
    "this method is based on purely geometrical grounds ( within the framework of the general theory of relativity ) , and presents decisive advantages with respect to conventional astronomical techniques ( see , for example , kundi et al .",
    "in particular , it avoids uncertainties in the construction of the cosmological distance ladder , and allows the expansion rate from high - redshift  i.e .",
    ", cosmologically distant  objects to be obtained .",
    "q0957 + 561a , b was the first gravitational lens system to be discovered ( walsh , carswell , & weymann 1979 ) , and has been monitored since then ( see , for example , schild & thompson 1995 ; oscoz et al .",
    "however , despite the several observational campaigns carried out , the value for the time delay was not well determined until very recently ( kundi et al .",
    "1997 ; oscoz et al .",
    "1997 ) . nowadays ,",
    "a time delay close to 420 days is widely accepted .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the main gravitational effect in q0957 + 561a , b is produced by two intervening objects : a giant elliptical galaxy ( brightest cluster galaxy , g1 ) , discovered by stockton ( 1980 ) , and a cluster of galaxies surrounding g1 .",
    "several mass models , in which the form of the lens ( galaxy + cluster ) profile were discussed , have been proposed since 1979 ( young et al . 1980 ; borgeest & refsdal 1984 ; greenfield et al .",

    "1998 ) . unfortunately , the models are incomplete ( the fits are unable to discriminate the contributions from mass associated with the galaxy and mass associated with the cluster ) , and are therefore unable to compute the hubble constant without additional information . to break this degeneracy , a measurement of either the velocity dispersion of g1 ( the 1d velocity dispersion associated with the dark objects in the halo of g1 ) or the surface mass density of the cluster ( fischer et al .",
    "1997 ) is needed .",
    "the first attempt to measure @xmath10 ( the 1d velocity dispersion associated with the luminous stars in g1 ) was made by rhee ( 1991 ) who , analyzing the mg  i_b _ triplet absorption lines from the spectra obtained with the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) , inferred a value for the stellar velocity dispersion of g1 of @xmath11 km s@xmath12 .",
    "some years later , falco et al . ( 1997 , hereafter fsmd ) have also measured the mg  i_b _ triplet with the keck telescope , reporting an apparent decrease of @xmath10 with angular distance from the center of g1 ( from 316 km s@xmath12 at @xmath13 01 to 262 km s@xmath12 at @xmath13 05 ) and obtaining an averaged value of @xmath14 . any giant elliptical",
    "could have a central black hole of 10@xmath1510@xmath8 @xmath5 ( see kormendy et al .",
    "1998 ) , and so the gradient has been preliminarly interpreted by the authors as due to a central massive dark object of mass @xmath16 4@xmath210@xmath8 @xmath4 @xmath5 ( @xmath17 = 100 @xmath18 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 ) , i.e. , a mass similar to the largest measured central mass in elliptical galaxies . by means of a more careful analysis ( see  4.2 ) , it can be shown that the decrease of @xmath10 with distance to the galaxy center reported by fsmd should imply a central object with a very large mass of @xmath16 10@xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 ( assuming , as do fsmd , that the gradient is only due to a compact nucleus ) . very recently ,",
    "tonry & franx ( 1998 , hereafter tf ) have measured ( also with the keck telescope ) the central stellar velocity dispersion inside an aperture of 1@xmath2 23 as well as the @xmath10 from different rows along the spectrograph slit .",
    "the slit was rotated by 90 deg with respect to the previous orientation by fsmd , and with this new configuration , no gradient is seen in the stellar velocity dispersion trend .",
    "therefore , tf do not agree with the conclusion of fsmd concerning the existence of a central dark object with very large mass .",
    "in fact , their dynamical data are in apparent agreement with the absence of a compact nucleus .",
    "we present here a new measurement of @xmath19 ( the spectrograph slit was rotated by about 10 deg and 20 deg with respect to the exposures 1@xmath203 and 4 by fsmd , respectively ) of similar accuracy to those of fsmd and tf . in ",
    "2 we present the observations and data reduction .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the derivation of @xmath10 ( @xmath21 @xmath7 15 ) from the spectra , and in  4 we use all the updated information ( the data of fsmd and tf , and ours ) to discuss the mass of a possible central massive dark object .",
    "the spectra of the lens galaxy in q0957 + 561 were collected at the wht ( la palma , canary islands , spain ) on 1997 february 4 .",
    "we used the red arm of the intermediate - dispersion spectrograph and imaging system ( isis ) with a tek ccd camera .",
    "the 158 line mm@xmath12 grating , r158r , gave a dispersion of 1.21    pixel@xmath12 , covering a spectral range from 5000 to 8000  .",
    "the seeing was 1@xmath22 fwhm and the spectral resolution , derived from comparison lamps , was @xmath23  .",
    "we centered a 1@xmath2 240@xmath22 slit on g1 ( but an aperture of only 1@xmath2 3@xmath22 is used ) , and oriented it along p.a .",
    "@xmath24 to include image b also in the aperture ( see fig .",
    "we took 11 exposures of 1800 s each .",
    "we also obtained three exposures of 10 s of the calibration star agk 2 + 14783 .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the standard software package iraf .",
    "the spectrum images were bias - subtracted and trimmed , flat - field corrected and cleaned of cosmic rays .",
    "wavelength calibration and distortion correction were performed with polynomial fits to the cu  ne arc lamp spectra . finally , we co - added all the 1800-s spectra . in fig .",
    "2 we show the resulting spectrum . in the analysis of the next section",
    "we will also make use of some data from the calibration star hd  27697 kindly provided by peletier et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , obtained in the same spectrograph but with higher spectral resolution .",
    "prior to computing the fwhm of the mg  i_b _ lines , the spectrum of the lens galaxy had to be continuum normalized and subtracted .",
    "first the continuum was drawn using as reference the calibration - star spectra and the results of fsmd .",
    "we fitted the continuum points to splines with cdraw , a command of dipso ( howarth & murray 1988 ) .",
    "next , the spectrum was divided by the fitted continuum . finally , the continuum level was set to zero by subtracting 1 . the resulting spectrum ( blueshifted dividing @xmath25 by @xmath26 ) in the wavelength range of the mg  i_b _ triplet is shown in figure 3 .    to obtain a first estimate of the fwhm we attempted a three - gaussian fit ( constraining the central lambdas of the gaussian functions by using the atomic wavelengths ) to the mg  i_b _ lines corresponding to g1",
    "we have supposed the same width for the three lines and fitted another two gaussian functions to the spectral absorption features close to the triplet in the red and blue wings , respectively . to restrict the fitting further , we have constrained the relative intensities of the lines using as reference values the quotients 0.85:1:0.81 , found fitting the mg  i_b _ triplet of the calibration star agk 2 + 14783 . after correcting for the instrumental width",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath27 .",
    "the uncertainty represents the rms error of the multi - gaussian fit to the data but does not include systematic sources of error coming from the use of the reference values for the relative intensity of the lines , or from the continuum correction .",
    "the last is a very important source of error since the galaxy absorption lines are strongly diluted by the qso emission .    to obtain more confident values for @xmath19 , we used the standard cross - correlation technique , in the following steps : ( i ) continuum correction ( as described above ) of the galaxy and template spectra , ( ii ) transformation of the wavelength axis taking logarithms , and ( iii ) cross - correlation of the spectra with an appropriate template using the command xcorr of dipso , which interpolates the data and masks the edges of each spectrum with a cosine bell .",
    "as templates we used alternatively : agk 2 + 14783 observed on the same night as the galaxy under the same instrumental conditions , hd  27697 observed with higher resolution , and this last spectrum convolved with a gaussian of 6.58   ( fwhm ) to match the resolution of the galaxy observations . to derive @xmath19 from the galaxy spectrum / stellar template cross - correlatation function , we have used the standard method also followed by fsmd .",
    "this consists in fitting a gaussian to the central points of the cross - correlation function peak .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussian fit depends on the template and galaxy broadenings . to find the fwhm(@xmath19 )",
    "relationship the method is calibrated by cross - correlating the template with itself smoothed with gaussian functions of different widths . in fig .",
    "4 we present the fwhm(@xmath19 ) calibrations corresponding to the three template used by us . using this method",
    "we have obtained the following @xmath19 values corresponding to each template : @xmath28 ( template : agk 2 + 14783 ) ; @xmath29 ( hd27697 ) ; and @xmath30 ( hd27697 convolved with a gaussian of fwhm = 6.58  ) . the uncertainties in the previous computations correspond to the rms errors in the cross - correlation fitting width .",
    "the best estimate corresponds to the star observed on the same night ( agk 2 + 14783 ) , which seems reasonable .",
    "since there are no significant differences with the results obtained with the other templates , we adopt it as the final value . in fig .",
    "5 we present a smoothed ( @xmath31 ) spectrum of the calibration star agk 2 + 14783 superimposed on the 0957 + 561 spectrum . to estimate the global uncertainty , we consider two different sources of error : ( i ) the rms error in the cross - correlation fitting width ( @xmath32 ) , and ( ii ) the selection of the template star .",
    "the dispersion among the three results derived using the three different templates ( @xmath33 ) is a conservative estimate of ( ii ) .",
    "consequently , we derive a total uncertainty of @xmath34 .",
    "the value for the stellar velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy derived by us ( 310 @xmath35 20 km s@xmath12 ) is in agreement with the value of 303 @xmath35 50 km s@xmath12 obtained by rhee ( 1991 ) , but there is a difference of 31 @xmath35 23 km s@xmath12 between the new result and the averaged value of 279 @xmath35 12 km s@xmath12 presented by fsmd . to exclude the possibility that this difference arises from the data analysis , we repeated the computations following the procedure used by fsmd and obtained essentially the same results .",
    "there is a relatively good agreement with respect to the central stellar velocity dispersion by tf ( 288 @xmath35 9 km s@xmath12 ) .",
    "the difference of 22 @xmath35 22 km s@xmath12 is consistent with zero .",
    "to relate physically the derived values for @xmath19 ( fsmd , tf and this paper ) with the compact central mass of g1 we focused on a simple scenario for the galaxy : a singular isothermal sphere , sis , with velocity dispersion @xmath36 , plus a central massive dark object , mdo , with mass @xmath37 .",
    "the halo of luminous stars ( @xmath38 ) and the halo of dark objects ( @xmath39 ) can be considered as spherically symmetric ideal gas spheres ( the velocity distribution is isotropic ) . in that case , the gas pressure is @xmath40 and the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath41\\rho_{i } , \\ ] ] with @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for a sis model of dark matter ,",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 , a velocity dispersion independent of the radius .",
    "however , the inclusion of a compact nucleus ( sis+mdo ) , @xmath46 , leads to @xmath47 , and now @xmath48 is not constant at every point of the galaxy . to obtain @xmath10",
    "it is necessary to know the behavior of @xmath49 .",
    "this information can be inferred by considering that the observed surface brightness profile , @xmath50 , traces the surface density of luminous matter , @xmath51    _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ data indicate that @xmath52 , @xmath53 1 ( 01 @xmath54 5 ) , where the @xmath55 relationship for g1 ( @xmath56 = 1 ) is given by @xmath57h@xmath12@xmath58(kpc ) , although the whole surface brightness profile is not well fitted by a single power law ( bernstein et al .",
    "1997 ) . at the _ hst _ resolution limit ,",
    "the light distribution could be singular , and so , a singular isothermal halo ( @xmath59 ) would be in rough agreement with the _ hst _ profile .",
    "our master equation will be @xmath60 we admit that the previous relations ( 14 ) are valid at separations ( @xmath58 ) and radii ( @xmath61 ) much greater than the schwarzschild radius of the mass @xmath37 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath37 = 4@xmath210@xmath8 @xmath4 @xmath5 , the schwarzschild radius is of about 4@xmath210@xmath62 @xmath4 pc .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 = 1 @xmath4 pc ( @xmath16 1/3 mas in angular separation ) can be a reasonable threshold of validity ( we avoid a complex description of the region at @xmath64 , which should include relativistic effects , the probable existence of an accretion disc , the possible distortion of the luminous isothermal halo as due to  cannibalism \" by the system central massive dark object + accretion disc , etc . ) .    in practice",
    ", one does not measure the stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath65 , but rather either the line - of - sight stellar velocity dispersion at separation @xmath58 ( using a small aperture ) or the velocity dispersion associated with the luminous stars inside a finite aperture , @xmath66 . in order to compare with observations ,",

    "equation ( 7 ) is the realistic version of eq .",
