    "relativistic shock fronts and currents sheets in relativistic flows play an important role in astrophysical models of gamma - ray bursts ( for a review see piran  @xcite ) , of jets and of pulsar winds ( see for instance michel  @xcite and kirk  @xcite ) . the underlying plasma is probably composed of electrons , positrons and protons , whose temperature may be relativistic , i.e. comparable to their rest mass energy .",
