    "the phenomenon of the @xmath10 decay is already known since more than 100 years @xcite but the interest in this process is still great ; in fact , it has even been increased during the last decade , both from the theoretical and the experimental sides .",
    "almost 30 theoretical papers can be found in the literature published only in 2009  2010 .",
    "many of them were devoted to new semi - empirical formulae for half - lives ( see f.e .",
    "@xcite ) which successfully describe the accumulated to - date experimental @xmath26 values and allow one to understand in a more clear way the perspectives of new investigations , in particlular , in studies of exotic very short - living isotopes close to the proton drip line @xcite or decays of super - heavy elements @xcite . in the investigations of long - living rare nuclear decays , the field of interest of the authors of this article , the improvements in the experimental techniques led to the enhancement of the sensitivity and to the discovery of new @xmath10 decays which were never observed previously because of the extra long half - lives of the decaying nuclides : @xmath27 yr was found for @xmath28bi which was considered before as the heaviest stable nuclide @xcite ; half - lives in the range of @xmath29 yr were measured for the @xmath30w in @xcite ; the @xmath10 decay of @xmath31eu was also recently observed with @xmath32 yr @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28bi and the @xmath30w are keepers of two current world records : the @xmath28bi for the longest @xmath10 half - life measured so far , and the @xmath30w for the lowest observed specific @xmath10 activity of only 2.3 disintegrations per year per gram of w of natural composition which is much lower than that for @xmath28bi ( 105 disintegrations per year per gram of bi ) , due to low natural abundance of the @xmath30w ( @xmath33 comparing to @xmath34 for @xmath28bi @xcite ) .",
    "all the six naturally occurring isotopes of platinum are potentially unstable in relation to @xmath10 decay ( see table 1 ) .",
    "however , only for one of them , the @xmath2pt ( with the biggest energy release of @xmath35 kev ) , this process was experimentally observed to - date , with the first successful measurement in 1921 @xcite . in that and in subsequent",
    "works the half - life of the @xmath2pt was determined in the range of @xmath36 yr ( see review @xcite and refs . therein ) ; the currently recommended half - life value is : @xmath37 yr @xcite . in all the previous works ,",
    "the @xmath2pt @xmath10 decay was observed only to the ground state ( g.s . ) of @xmath3os .",
    "however , the first excited level of the daughter nuclide @xmath3os ( @xmath4 ) has a quite low energy : @xmath38 kev @xcite , and the energy available to the @xmath10 particle in the decay to this level : @xmath39 kev , is not much lower than that in the g.s .",
    "to g.s . transition .",
    "our theoretical estimates of the corresponding half - life ( see details in section 4 ) gave values in the range of @xmath40 yr .",
    "this allowed us to hope to discover the @xmath2pt @xmath41 @xmath3os(@xmath42 ) decay through the observation of the 137.2 kev @xmath0 quantum emitted in the deexcitation of the @xmath3os@xmath43 nucleus with a well shielded low background hp ge detector even using a pt sample with natural isotopic composition with very low percentage of @xmath2pt ( @xmath44 ) .",
    ".natural abundances ( @xmath45 ) of pt isotopes and energy releases ( @xmath46 ) expected in the @xmath10 decays of pt to os .",
    "@xmath47 is number of nuclei of the specific pt isotope per 1 g of natural platinum .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tb : summary ]",
    "we calculated half - life values for the @xmath10 decays of the different pt isotopes with the cluster model of ref . @xcite and with semiempirical formulae @xcite based on liquid drop model and description of @xmath10 decay as a very asymmetric fission process .",
    "the approaches @xcite were tested with a set of experimental half - lives of almost four hundred @xmath10 emitters and demonstrated good agreement between calculated and experimental @xmath9 values , mainly inside the factor of @xmath48 .",
    "we also successfully used these works to predict @xmath9 values in our searches for @xmath10 decays of @xmath30w @xcite and @xmath31eu @xcite obtaining adequate agreement between the first experimentally measured and calculated results .",
    "as other example , the calculated @xmath9 values for the g.s . to g.s .",
    "@xmath10 decay of @xmath2pt are equal : @xmath49 yr in accordance with @xcite and @xmath50 yr with @xcite , while the experimental values were measured in the range of @xmath36 yr @xcite ( recommended value is @xmath51 yr @xcite ) .",
    "the ground state of all the pt isotopes has spin and parity @xmath52 , except of @xmath23pt with @xmath53 .",
    "we study here the transitions to the daughter levels with @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 for @xmath23pt @xmath41 @xmath57os g.s . ) . because of the difference between the spins of the initial and of the final nuclear states , the emitted @xmath10 particle will have non - zero angular momentum : values of @xmath58 or @xmath59 are the most preferable among the allowed ones by the selection rules for the transitions with @xmath60 or @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "thus , in the @xmath9 estimation , we take into account the hindrance factors of hf = 1.9 for @xmath58 and hf = 9.0 for @xmath59 , calculated in accordance with @xcite .",
    "the results of the calculations are given in table 2 .",
    "for the @xmath10 decay @xmath2pt @xmath41 @xmath3os(@xmath61 , 137.2 kev ) observed in this work , the semiempirical approach of @xcite gives a better agreement with the measured @xmath9 value .    from the theoretical results ,",
    "it is clear that the observation of other pt @xmath10 decays presented in table 2 is out of reach of current experimental possibilities , except probably for decay @xmath2pt @xmath41 @xmath3os(@xmath55 , 434.1 kev ) .",
    "the latter will need 3 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity which , however , could be possible by using enriched @xmath2pt instead of natural pt with @xmath62pt ) = 0.014% .",
    "the alpha decays of naturally occurring platinum isotopes , which are accompanied by the emission of @xmath0 quanta , were searched for with the help of a low background hp ge detector in the gran sasso national laboratories of the infn .",
    "the alpha decay of @xmath2pt to the first excited level of @xmath3os ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 kev ) was detected for the first time by the observation of the @xmath0 line at energy ( @xmath63 ) kev at @xmath64 significance level while it is absent in the background spectrum of the detector .",
    "we did not find alternative processes which could mimic this effect .",
    "the half - life is determined as : @xmath65pt @xmath41 @xmath3os@xmath66 kev ) ) = [ @xmath67(stat.)@xmath7(syst.)]@xmath8 yr .",
    "this value is in relevant agreement with theoretical calculations based on the liquid drop model and the description of the @xmath10 decay as a very asymmetric fission process @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath9 limits for @xmath10 decays with population of the lowest excited levels of os nuclei ( for @xmath21pt , @xmath22pt , @xmath24pt ) and for transition to the ground states of os nuclei ( for @xmath23pt , @xmath25pt ) were determined at level of @xmath11 yr .",
    "these limits were set for the first time or they are better than those known from earlier experiments .",
    "the alpha decay of @xmath2pt to the second excited level of @xmath3os ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 kev ) could be detected in higher sensitivity experiment with platinum enriched in @xmath2pt to @xmath70 . however , because its natural abundance is extremely low ( @xmath44 ) , this is a very expensive task with the current technologies .",
