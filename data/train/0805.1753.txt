    "the study of the critical quantum behavior of systems@xcite , which is induced by quantum fluctuations , has been object of  great interest in recent years .",
    "this critical behavior , which controls the properties of the systems at very low temperature , is present in different systems . in particular , for magnetic systems , they have been responsible for unusual properties observed in low dimensional magnetic materials @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of the critical behavior of spin systems  in low dimension , particularly the exactly soluble , is of great importance for understanding the properties of these materials .    among these models ,",
    "the one - dimensional xy model introduced by lieb , schultz and mattis @xcite , despite being almost fifty year old , is still the best one to describe exactly magnetic quantum transitions .",
    "the rather rich quantum critical behavior presented by the model can be seen in a recent work by the authors @xcite and in the references therein , where they study the anisotropic model on the inhomogeneous periodic lattice .",
    "the study of the model on the inhomogeneous open lattice has also been recently addressed by feldman @xcite .",
    "the isotropic model on the inhomogeneous lattice has also been studied by the authors @xcite , where a detailed study of the static and dynamic critical properties is presented .",
    "although the model has been applied mostly in the study of the quantum  critical behavior of magnetic systems @xcite , more recently it has also been applied in the study of quantum entanglement , which plays an essential role in the quantum computation .",
    "these applications can be found in the recent work by amico _",
    "et al_.@xcite  and in the references therein .",
    "in particular , in a recent work on quantum communication in a spin system , avellino et al.@xcite have studied the strong effect of long - range interaction on the fidelity of transmission of quantum information .    besides the importance of the long - range interaction in the transmission of quantum information in spin chains",
    ", its presence can induce classical critical behavior in these systems which is essential for the study of the classical / quantum crossover .",
    "the one - dimensional xy model is among the models which present this behavior , provided a uniform long - range interaction is considered . in particular , for the isotropic one , in the presence of a homogeneous long - range interaction along the transverse field direction , it can still be solved exactly , and its solution has been obtained by the authors @xcite . besides the appearance of classical critical behavior , the most important features presented by the homogeneous model have been the existence of quantum bicritical points and , particularly , the existence of first order quantum transitions .",
    "another relevant result obtained in the study of the homogeneous case was the exact determination of the classical / quantum crossover for first and second order phase transitions , and the verification of the scaling relations proposed continentino and ferreira @xcite for first order quantum transitions .",
    "as pointed out by pfleiderer @xcite , quantum first order transitions can be driven by different mechanisms , and to look at this new quantum critical behavior , in an exactly soluble problem , has been the one of the motivations to analyze the isotropic model on the inhomogeneous periodic chain with long - range interaction .",
    "besides this point , the possibility of having multiple first and second order quantum transitions and multicritical points of higher order have also been important motivations for considering the long - range interaction in the inhomogeneous model .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will extend our previous results @xcite by looking at an extended version of the models previously considered .",
    "although the model presents classical and quantum critical behavior , we will restrict our analysis to the quantum one .    in section 2 we present the exact solution of the model and obtain the functional of the helmholtz free energy at arbitrary temperatures . the quantum critical behavior is discussed in section 3 , and it is determined from the equation of state at @xmath3 .",
    "explicit results for the quantum phase diagrams , induced magnetization @xmath5 and isothermal susceptibility @xmath4 for systems with different sizes of the unit cell are also presented . finally in section 4",
    "we summarize the main results of the paper .",
    "we consider the isotropic xy model @xmath0  on the inhomogeneous periodic chain with @xmath1  cells , @xmath2  sites per cell , and lattice parameter @xmath6 , in a transverse field , with long - range interactions among the spin components in the @xmath7 direction .",
