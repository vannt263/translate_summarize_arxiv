    "the production of correlated pairs of particles is an important requirement for probing the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , in quantum optics correlated pairs of photons were used to demonstrate violation of bell s inequalities @xcite or the hong - ou - mandel effect @xcite . in atomic physics ,",
    "pairs of atoms were produced in the process of the four - wave mixing in optical lattice @xcite , collision - induced deexcitation of the cloud @xcite , and collision of bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "these many - body systems can be used to demonstrate sub - poissonian relative atom number statistics @xcite , the violation of the cauchy - schwarz inequality for matter waves @xcite , atomic hong - ou - mandel effect @xcite , or ghost - imaging @xcite .",
    "the nonclassicality of the states of the system can be potentially employed in the violation of bell s inequality for atoms  @xcite or atomic interferometry  @xcite .    in order to have a high degree of control of the fragile states of the pairs of atoms ,",
    "it is necessary to posess an accurate model describing the system as well as the processes underlying generation of the correlated pairs . in this paper",
    "we analyze elastic scattering of atoms from a pair of colliding bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "such condensate collisions were investigated in theoretical papers @xcite . as a result of binary collisions between the particles that constitute the counter - propagating clouds , atomic pair scatter out from the condensates with opposite velocities . in the spontaneous regime , where bosonic enhancement does not influence single collision event ,",
    "the direction of velocity of outgoing particles is random . as a result of superposition principle ,",
    "the quantum state of single atomic pair is entangled in momentum directions .",
    "such systems , with non - classical correlations between massive particles entangled in external degrees of freedom , are ideal for fundamental experimental tests of quantum mechanics such as einstein - podolsky - rosen gedanken experiment @xcite .    in order to prove the presence of non - classical correlations between scattered atoms , or to utilize the entanglement in quantum - enhanced atomic interferometry , properties of the state of the system need to be well known",
    ". in particular , an important quantities are the widths of the correlation volume , which describes the extent of the correlation between the two particles . to find those widths one has to analyze properties of the two particle correlation function .",
    "this function was recently measured experimentally @xcite , and also was the subject of theoretical studies based on perturbation theory @xcite or stochastic calculations @xcite .    in the case of perturbation theory ,",
    "a number of uncontrolled approximations were introduced in order to obtain analytical results .",
    "the main approximations were to neglect the interaction between atoms within becs during the collision process , and omission of the influence of the mother - condensates on the scattered atoms .",
    "therefore , it is important to know how the interactions between atoms change the state of the system , and how they modify the non - classicality of the correlations between the particles .",
    "the results are of importance for the planned experiments that might test epr - correlations , non - locality , or utilize such systems in quantum - enhanced metrology .    here , we derive , within the perturbation theory , approximate analytical expressions for the two particle correlation function taking into account the contribution from the interaction between atoms . we show that there are two types of correlations : `` back to back ''  related to the fact that particle are scattered in pairs , and `` local ''  which describe bosonic bunching effect .",
    "the obtained formulas connect correlations functions with colliding condensate wavefunctions being a solution of time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "the derived expressions have the form convenient for numerical analysis and as such can be useful for interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "additionally , we derive approximate analytical form of the colliding condensates wavefunctions using time - dependent variational approximation . using these wavefunctions",
    "we obtain analytical expressions for the two - body correlation functions .",
    "we analyze properties of the correlation functions among which the most important are the correlation widths for which we present explicit expressions .",
    "finally , we present the properties of the correlation volumes .    the paper is constructed as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we present the system and the methods to describe it based on the bogoliubov theory . in this section",
    "we derive general expressions for a two particle correlation function which structure can be divided into the two types of correlations .",
    "also , we present the results of variational approximation for static and colliding bose - einstein condensates .",
    "in section  [ sbb ] we analyze the `` back to back '' correlations , and present approximate expressions for the pair correlation function . then using the approximate condensate wave functions given by variational approach",
    ", we derive explicit formulas for the pair correlation function and analyze its properties in important cases .",
    "we unify the obtained results in explicit expressions , and present the properties of the correlation volume . additionally , we introduce a semiclassical model and compare its results with the results of the quantum one . in section  [ lc ]",
    "we analyze the `` local '' pair correlations , which are directly related to single particle correlation function @xmath0 .",
    "we introduce a classically motivated function describing properties of the source of atoms and relate it with the single particle correlation function .",
    "further , we present explicit formula for this function obtained from a quantum model of the process .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 using the approximate condensate wave functions given by variational approach and analyze its properties in certain cases .",
    "also in this section , we unify the obtained results in explicit expressions , and present the properties of the correlation volume .",
    "the details of the derivations of most of the formulas as well as the conditions presented in the main body of the paper can be found in the appendices .",
    "in the limit of low energies the collision of bosonic atoms can be described by a single parameter called the scattering length  @xcite . in our considerations",
    "we assume that the interaction potential is effectively described by this parameter .",
    "additionally , we assume that the atomic gas is in the dilute limit , i.e. , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a maximal density of the colliding clouds and @xmath3 is the scattering length .",
    "furthermore , we restrict our considerations to the so - called collisionless regime , in which the probability of a secondary collision of the scattered atom with the atoms from the condensate is much smaller than unity .",
    "this condition requires that the size @xmath4 of the cloud in the direction of the atomic velocity is much smaller than the mean free path of the scattered particles @xmath5 , that is @xmath6 .",
    "another assumption we use is that the total number of scattered atoms is much smaller than the number of atoms in the moving clouds .",
    "we remark one fact that determines our interests in specific observables . after the collision",
    "the system consists of the two condensates and the halo of scattered atoms .",
    "some of the scattered atoms are located on the condensates , because their mean velocity points in the direction of the velocities of the condensates , and both of these vectors are of the same magnitude . however , the analysis of those scattered atoms is difficult experimentally , because the density of the halo is small compared to the density of the condensates . for this reason , in all the considerations below ,",
    "we restrict our study to the atoms that are scattered away from the collision direction of two condensates ( we take it to be @xmath7 axis ) .",
    "specifically , we assume that the part @xmath8 of the wavevector @xmath9 of the scattered atom perpendicular to the long axis of the condensate satisfies the following conditions : @xmath10 .",
    "the system that obeys all of the above restrictions is well described by the bogoliubov method  @xcite . in this method moving condensates",
    "are described by single particle wave - function @xmath11 which satisfy gross pitaevskii equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 parametrizes the interaction strength between atoms .",
    "the properties of scattered atoms are described by the field operator @xmath14 which undergoes time evolution given by @xmath15 with : @xmath16 we assume that the initial state of noncondensed particles is vacuum  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath17 in the calculation of mean values of the product of @xmath18 operators , taken for various positions , the wick s theorem can be applied .",
    "this is a consequence of the lineary of the equation of motion , eq .  , and the fact that the initial state is vacuum .",
    "therefore , all the correlation functions of arbitrary order decompose into products of anomalous density @xmath19 and single particle correlation function @xmath20 for example , the two particle correlation function is of the following form : @xmath21 in this equation , the first term , given by @xmath22 , is a product of single particle densities , and so it represents uncorrelated particles .",
    "the presence of second and third terms are responsible for nontrivial corelations between particles .    in the next sections ,",
    "we show that the terms @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent correlations of particles with opposite and collinear velocities , respectively .",
    "the appearance of correlation of particles with opposite velocities , called `` back to back '' or `` cross '' correlation , is a consequence of the fact that atoms are scattered in pairs of opposite momenta .",
    "the correlation of particles with collinear velocities , called `` local '' correlation , is related to the bosonic bunching effect .    in the considered system",
    "a bosonic enhancement effect can take place .",
    "this effect was both predicted theoretically  @xcite and observed experimentally  @xcite . in this paper , we restrict to the regime where the effects of the bosonic enhancement are negligible .",
    "then , the heisenberg equation of motion , eq .  , can be approximately solved with help of perturbation theory . in this case",
    ", the formula for the anomalous density reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a single body propagator of hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , on the grounds of perturbative approach , the following relation between one body correlation function and anomalous density can be established : @xmath27 the details of the derivation of the above formulas are presented in appendix  [ appbog ] .",
    "the conditions for the validity of the first order perturbation calculus are derived and discussed in appendix  [ vp ] .",
    "let us now further specify the properties of the considered system .",
    "we initially deal with a single condensate described by a wavefunction @xmath28 satisfying stationary gp equation @xmath29 where the trapping potential @xmath30 and the normalization condition @xmath31 .",
    "below , we focus on elongated cigar shaped condensate , for which @xmath32 . the two counterpropagating condensates are created from the stationary one by applying bragg pulse and switching off the trapping potential @xcite .",
    "after the pulse , the wavefunction takes the following form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the normalization coefficient .",
    "this wavefunction represents two wavepackets , @xmath35 , each propagatin with mean velocity @xmath36 alogn @xmath7-axis .",
    "the collision takes place along longitudinal axis , the @xmath7-axis , of the condensate .",
    "the decomposition of the wavefunction into two counterpropagating wavepackes is permissible also for later times . to this end , we assume that the width of two counterpropagating condensates in the momentum space during the collision are much smaller then their mean momenta equal to @xmath37 .",
    "we additionally assume that the mean field potential @xmath38 is much smaller than the kinetic energy @xmath39 . in appendix  [ timeevolution ]",
    "we show that these two conditions can be replaced by a single one which reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the radial width of the initial condensate , and @xmath42 is the radial harmonic oscillator length . the above condition combined with the fact that the system is elongated , implies @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the longitudinal size of the initial condensate . as a consequence , @xmath45 which makes eq .",
    "( [ cwzor ] ) to take the following simple form : @xmath46    the assumption the widths of the momentum distribution of both colliding condensates during the whole collision are much smaller than @xmath47 , leads to two distinct momentum distributions centered around @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to decompose the condensate wavefunction @xmath11 into two wavefunctions , denoted by @xmath49 , in the following way : @xmath50 these functions , @xmath51 , describe the two counterprogating parts of the condensate .",
    "note that , as implied by eq .",
    "( [ cwzor2 ] ) , initial conditions are @xmath52 for these components .",
    "the stated assumption leads to great simplification of the solution of the gp equation , eq .",
    ", on the basis of the slowly varying envelope approximation @xcite . within this approximation , the gp equation for @xmath11 decouples into set of two equations for",
    "@xmath49 @xmath53 let us remark , that eq .",
    "( [ sv ] ) is much better for numerical implementation of our problem than the initial gp equation , eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) .",
    "the reason is that in eq .",
    "( [ sv ] ) the highly oscillatory behavior in position , due to @xmath54 , as well as in time , due to @xmath55 , is removed .",
    "consequently , the window in the momentum representation , required for numerical simulation , needs to take the momentum width of the @xmath51 alone , and this is much smaller than the momentum window required for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) , the latter being of the order of @xmath56 .    in order to describe the properties of the wavefunctions @xmath51 , we use variational method , to solve stationary and time dependent gp equations , eqs .",
    "( [ sgp ] ) and  ( [ sv ] ) .",
    "the details of the solution are described in appendix  [ apsol ] . here",
    ", we just state the obtained results .",
    "we assume that initially the wavefeunction can be approximated by a gaussian ansatz of the form : @xmath57 after time @xmath58 , the wavefunctions evolve into : @xmath59 where @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "notice , that the final form is also a gaussian function , but with centres moving in opposite directions with velocities @xmath63 , and with time - dependent widths .",
    "the components of the wavefunctions , given by @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ vatnowe ] ) , can be investigated further in order to determine important timescales in the problem .",
    "first , notice that there is a characteristic time @xmath64 during which the wavepackets cross each other .",
    "this can be defined as the time of the collision .",
    "the second characteristic time @xmath65 is equal to the time needed for @xmath66 to change its width by a factor of @xmath67 .",
    "this two times describe the density properties of the system .",
    "next , characteristic times correspond to changes in the phase of the wavepacket .",
    "it is natural to define following three timescales : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "note , that @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , we see the three times , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are all larger than @xmath77 .    in this section we described the colliding condensates . in the next one , we characterize the properties of the scattered atoms .",
    "let us now show that the back to back correlations are given by the term @xmath78 . to this end",
    ", we analyze the structure of the anomalous density @xmath79 .",
    "however , notice first that in the experimental situation the atoms are measured at time @xmath80 which is usually much larger than the time of the scattering process .",
    "it is thus permissible to investigate the limit @xmath81 .",
    "we introduce new variables : @xmath82 , and define @xmath83 in the above we have introduced additional phase @xmath84 $ ] to get finite limit and additional factor @xmath85 to satisfy normalization condition @xmath86 as free propagator . upon inserting eq .",

    "( [ psip ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ b0 ] ) we obtain @xmath88 we shall now make use of the assumptions stated in section [ mod ] .",
    "we assumed there that the widths in the momentum space of each of wavepacket @xmath51 at any time are much smaller than @xmath47 and that the kinetic energy @xmath39 is much larger than than the mean field interaction energy @xmath38 .",
    "this assumptions have two consequences .",
    "first , the dominant temporal phase is given by factor @xmath89 .",
    "second , the dominant spatial phase factor in @xmath90 is @xmath91 . inserting eq .",
    "( [ bdef ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ mkw ] ) and using the above stated assumptions we notice that the temporal integral is vanishingly small unless @xmath92 .",
    "as the width of @xmath51 in momentum space is much smaller than @xmath47 the spatial integral gives nonzero values for the term @xmath93 if @xmath94 , and for the terms @xmath95 if @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , the term responsible for the scattering of atoms into the observed halo is due to the term @xmath93 . as we are interested only in the properties of atoms appearing in the halo we neglect the contribution from the other two terms , i.e. , @xmath97 the above analysis also shows that the anomalous density with @xmath98 given by eq .",
    "( [ bp ] ) leads to @xmath99 and @xmath100 being practically antiparallel with length equal approximately to @xmath47 . for other choices of @xmath99 and @xmath100 the value of anomalous density is vanishing",
    "thus , as long as it is permissible to exploit free propagator for @xmath101 , we have shown that the back to back correlation is represented by the term @xmath102 in the two particle correlation function in eq .  .",
    "the situation with the true propagator , the one which takes into account the interaction of scattered particles with the atoms from the condensates , is much more complicated as there is no analytical formula for @xmath101 .",

    "the calculations are to be done numerically . however , below we exploit the approximate solution of the colliding condensates wavefunctions , given by eq .",
    "( [ vatnowe ] ) , to calculate and analyze the properties of the back to back correlation function .",
    "but before going on , we pause to introduce a semiclassical model of the back to back correlation function , which will serve as a probe of quantum characteristics of the collision process .      from a theoretical point of view , it is interesting to compare the results of a quantum model to a classical one . to this end , we consider a semiclassical model of colliding clouds .",
    "we describe the two wavepackets by a single - particle phase space densities , denoted by @xmath115 , and apply all the assumptions stated previously that defined our system , i.e. ,    * dilute gas limit , so that only two body collisions are of importance , * neglect secondary collision between the scattered atoms and the atoms in the condensates , * neglect depletion of the condensate due to the scattering .",
    "as we compare this model with the quantum one we put @xmath9 vector instead of velocity in the phase space density definition , these are simply related by @xmath116 . for this semiclassical model",

    "this formula resembles the production term in the collision integral of the boltzmann equation , in which apropriate substitutions for the physical quantities are made .",

    "eq .  , in terms of the condensate wavefunctions only",
    "let us now calculate the anomalous density for some cases using the approximate analytical form of @xmath51 given by the variational method presented in appendix [ apsol ] .",

    "a complete analysis should investigate the anomalous density for all values of @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
