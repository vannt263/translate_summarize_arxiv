    "galaxy formation is a complex process involving the simultaneous action of many physical mechanisms .",
    "even though we have a well defined cosmological framework , @xmath0cdm , within which to study galaxy formation , numerical simulations have achieved limited success as far as reproducing the structural properties of observed galaxies .",
    "such simulations give rise to disks that are smaller and denser than their observed counterparts ( e.g. navarro & benz 1991 , katz et al .",
    "1992 , navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) .",
    "a further problem is the difficulty in producing disk dominated systems , even when haloes with quiet merger histories are selected .",
    "these problems may be due to the lack of a correct treatment of the physics of the multiphase interstellar medium , in particular of the balance between radiative cooling and heating from various forms of feedback arising from star formation ( white & frenk 1991 , navarro & benz 1991 , katz et al .",
    "1992 , robertson et al .",
    "however , limitations in the numerical models , for example the coarse mass and force resolution , are perhaps another major cause of the problem ( governato et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in this paper we use new n - body+sph simulations where we achieve a resolution in the gas component of @xmath1 m@xmath2 , in order to follow the formation of a galactic disk via the cooling of gas within equilibrium dark matter halos .",
    "cosmological simulations suggest that the large disks of spiral galaxies form mainly from the smooth accretion of gas after the last major merger ( sommer - larsen , gtz & portinari 2003 , abadi et al .",
    "2003 , governato et al .",
    "2004 ) . therefore , although our simulations are not within the full cosmological framework , they are designed to follow the quiet gas accretion phase during the main epoch of disk formation .",
    "this allows us to resolve the cooling flow of gas at a very high resolution , which complements studies of disk formation within cosmological simulations .    the hierarchical formation of massive dark matter haloes , above a characteristic circular velocity of @xmath3 km / s is expected to efficiently shock heat the gas to their virial temperatures throughout the virial region ( dekel & birnboim 2004 , mccarthy et al . 2003 ) .",
    "angular momentum of the gas and dark matter is generated early by tidal torques , allowing it to cool and form a rotationally supported disk ( crampin & hoyle 1964 ) .",
    "the process of gas cooling from the halo into the disk is difficult to study observationally and little evidence for gas accretion is observed in galaxies or cluster mass haloes . cooling flow clusters are so named because of the observed decrease in the central temperature of the gas . in galactic haloes",
    "the gas temperature can be lower than @xmath4 k and thus difficult to observe by current x - ray telescopes ( benson et al .",
    "2000 ) , but there is evidence for a hot ionised corona surrounding the milky way .",
    "recent measurements of ovi and ovii absorption in the uv and x - ray part of the spectrum ( sembach et al . 2003 ) lend support to the idea that a lumpy gaseous galactic halo exists and that such emission comes from the interface between warm clouds and the hotter diffuse medium .",
    "maller & bullock ( 2004 ) suggested that the gas supply to galaxies is mostly in the form of discrete warm clouds .",
    "small density and temperature fluctuations are enhanced by the cooling process resulting in a runaway instability and the formation of a fragmented distribution of cooled material , in the form of warm @xmath5k@xmath6 clouds , pressure - supported within the hot gaseous background .",
    "this model may explain the properties of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) around the milky way ( blitz et al .",
    "1999 ) , for example their radial velocity distribution and angular sizes .",
    "recently , fraternali et al .",
    "( 2005 ) measured the rotation curve of extra - planar neutral gas around the large spiral galaxy ngc 891 .",
    "this gas could be accreting material or gas falling back to the disk via a galactic fountain from star - formation .",
    "the thermal instability mentioned above results in cloud masses that are predicted to be @xmath7 m@xmath2 which is an order of magnitude below the minimum mass resolved in the sph calculation in current state - of - the art galaxy formation simulations ( e.g. governato et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this paper",
    "we aim to have sufficient resolution to study the formation of a two - phase medium which will allow us to compare the kinematics of the gas with the observations of fraternali et al .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we present the modelling of our halos , the treatment of the cooling and the numerical techniques . in section 3",
    "we compare the kinematics of the gas and the disk with the observational data from fraternali et al .",
    "the properties of the cool clouds are studied in section 4 , including survival times , mass function and numerical convergence studies .",
    "we conclude and summarise in section 5 .",
    "we set up a spherical equilibrium halo with an nfw profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) and structural parameters consistent with predictions of the standard @xmath0cdm model ( kazantzidis , magorrian & moore 2004 ) .",
    "we include a fraction of the total halo mass , @xmath8 , as a hot baryonic component with the same radial distribution and a temperature profile such that the gas is initially in hydrostatic equilibrium for an adiabatic equation of state ( eos ) for the gas .",
    "of course this kind of setup can not model galaxy formation in general ( no substructure , no counter rotation etc . ) but should reproduce the late phase accretion after the last major merger . to illustrate the initial conditions we plot the initial particle distribution and the density profiles in figure [ ics ] .",
    "the shape for the initial density of gas and dark matter is the same whereas only the normalisation is different .",
    "the curves after @xmath9 gyr show that the hot halo evolves out of equilibrium when using cooling , the density of the dark matter after @xmath9 gyr is enhanced in the centre due to adiabatic contraction .",
    "the dark matter haloes are constructed using a multi - mass technique such that the innermost region is very well resolved . for the m33 `` standard '' model ( see below ) we use @xmath10 particles distributed in the inner sphere of radius @xmath11 kpc , then @xmath12 particles in the next shell to @xmath13 kpc and the outer halo is resolved with @xmath14 particles .",
    "this minimises spurious heating of the gas particles due to collisions with dark matter particles",
    "( steinmetz & white 1997 ) and enables us to resolve the dark matter cusp to @xmath15 parsecs .",
    "the reliability of these initial conditions are tested and reported in zemp et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "the gas has a specific angular momentum distribution and spin parameter consistent with values found for dark matter haloes within cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "the initial specific angular momentum profile is a power law following @xmath16 , similar to the value @xmath17 found by bullock et al .",
    "we also ran simulations with different angular momentum distributions to confirm that this does not affect the conclusions in this paper .",
    "the spin parameter is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the average specific angular momentum of the gas , @xmath20 is total energy of the halo and @xmath21 is the gravitational constant",
    ". this definition matches the one commonly used under the assumption that there is no angular momentum transport between the spherical dark matter halo and the gas .",
    "we carried out additional simulations where we set up angular momentum profiles by merging two equilibrium spherical haloes with different impact parameters .",
    "both sets of simulations gave similar results .",
    "the detailed description of the runs are presented in kaufmann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "we constructed dark plus gaseous halo models with parameters that are expected to produce disks similar to those of the milky way ( mw model ) and ngc 598 ( m33 model ) .",
    "for the mw model the virial velocity @xmath22 km / s , virial radius @xmath23 kpc , virial mass @xmath24 m@xmath2 , halo concentration @xmath25 , spin parameter @xmath26 and the baryonic fraction is @xmath27 and we resolve the gas halo with particles of @xmath28 m@xmath29 for the m33 model the parameters are : @xmath30 m@xmath2 , @xmath31 kpc , @xmath32 km / s , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and spin parameter @xmath35 . in the standard m33 model the hot gaseous halo is resolved with @xmath36 particles of equal mass @xmath37 m@xmath2 . to test further the effects of resolution , we performed simulations in which we use eight times as many sph particles within the inner 30 kpc , the `` refined_8 '' m33 simulation .",
    "we split each sph particle into eight `` child '' particles ( bromm 2000 , kitsionas 2000 , escala et al .",
    "the new particles are randomly distributed according to the sph smoothing kernel within a volume of size @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the smoothing length of the parent particle .",
    "the velocities of the child particles are equal to those of their parent particle and so is their temperature , while each child particle is assigned a mass equal to @xmath40 the mass of the parent particle .",
    "the new particles have a mass of @xmath41 m@xmath2 .",
    "we used then the same method to create the `` refined_32 '' m33 simulation , where each sph particle within the inner 30 kpc has been split into @xmath42 particles having masses of @xmath43 m@xmath2 .",
    "an overview to the m33 simulations can be found in table [ cap : tab mass 2 ] .",
    "we use the high performance parallel tree+sph code gasoline ( wadsley , stadel & quinn 2004 ) , which is an extension of the pure n - body gravity code pkdgrav developed by stadel ( 2001 ) .",
    "it uses an artificial viscosity which is the shear reduced version ( balsara 1995 ) of the standard monaghan ( 1992 ) artificial viscosity .",
    "gasoline uses a spline kernel with compact support for the softening of the gravitational and sph quantities .",
    "the energy equation is solved using the asymmetric formulation , @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the internal energy , pressure , density , mass , velocity and a kernel function , respectively .",
    "this formulation is shown to yield very similar results compared to the entropy conserving formulation but conserves energy better ( wadsley , stadel & quinn 2004 ) . in a test problem with an expanding sphere and no gravity ,",
    "the entropy conservation for each particle as measured by the temperature error has an rms error of @xmath51 for a factor of @xmath52 change in density ; however , this is a very conservative estimate since in situations of astrophysical interest entropy conservation should be measured against the other contributors to changes in entropy , namely shocks and cooling , and these are expected to be dominant , especially in the case of a gravitational collapse . in all the runs we included compton and radiative cooling using a standard cooling function for a fully ionised , primordial gas of helium and hydrogen .",
    "the radiative losses per step are limited to no more than @xmath53 per dynamical step and the cooling can adapt the time steps to suit its needs .",
    "the density changes are quite slow  occurring on the dynamical time scale and typically less than 1 - 2 percent per step .",
    "therefore the assumption of a constant density in one time step contributes only a small error to the cooling rates , especially compared to missing coolants such as metals . because of the lack of molecular cooling and metals the efficiency of our cooling function drops sharply below @xmath54 k. moreover we used an artificial lower limit for the gas temperature ( @xmath55 k or @xmath56 k ) , higher than the cut - off in the cooling function , to crudely model the effect of the uv background and stellar feedback ( see e.g. barnes 2002 )",
    "this temperature floor is also required to avoid the onset of a violent gravitational instability and fragmentation of the gaseous layer after the disk begins to assemble .    for the identification of the clouds we use a friends of friends algorithm ( fof ) , using @xmath42 particles ( equal to the number of particles in the smoothing kernel ) as the threshold .",
    "the linking length was chosen to be of order @xmath57 the mean particle separation in the standard run , it was then lowered for higher resolution ( according to the smaller mean particle separation ) and we checked in the standard simulation that the number of clouds found with the fof does depend only weakly on the exact choice of the linking length .",
    "due to cooling the hot gas halo loses its hydrostatic equilibrium configuration quite quickly ( see figure [ press - sup ] ) .",
    "the inner disk rapidly forms from cooling gas from a nearly spherical region close to the centre ( within @xmath58 kpc ) of the halo .",
    "the accretion rate of cold gas slows down with time and the outer disk region forms from material which flows preferentially down the angular momentum axis .",
    "this leaves a `` cylindrical '' region of hotter and less dense gas above and below the disk plane as is evident in figure [ cap : firstcoll ] .",
    "this non - spherical inflow of gas from the halo to the disk is not currently considered in semi - analytic models for disk formation .       as expected , the higher angular momentum m33 model produces a more extended disk than the mw model .",
    "furthermore the morphology of the disks within the two models is very different .",
    "the higher baryon fraction and lower spin parameter of the mw model gives rise to a disk that dominates the mass distribution in the inner region .",
    "the mw model forms a bar in the very early stages and has the appearance of an sb galaxy whereas the m33 model resembles a galaxy of type sc - sd , with a smoother more flocculent spiral pattern . even though the m33 model does not undergo bar formation , the cooling gas forms a dense central nucleus which has a size of the order our length resolution of a few hundred parsecs .",
    "the global morphological evolution of both models depends on the mass and force resolution and is discussed in kaufmann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . here",
    "we present the analysis of the kinematics of the cooling gas .",
    "fraternali et al .",
    "( 2005 ) observed the rotation velocity of neutral gas as a function of scale height above the disk for the galaxy ngc 891 which has a luminosity and rotational speed similar to the milky way .",
    "the found extra planar neutral gas up to distances of 15 kpc above the plane and found a velocity gradient of about @xmath59 km s@xmath60kpc@xmath60 in the vertical direction .",
    "the gas closest to the disk , at @xmath61 kpc , appears to corotate with it but they argue that due to the limited angular resolution this may be the effect of beam - smearing .",
    "they considered a galactic fountain model in order to explain these observations , but that model failed to reproduce the amount of lagging .",
    "they argue that gas accretion may be important as well in these situations .    here",
    "we present results from our mw simulation where we show that this velocity gradient arises naturally in the accretion phase of the gas as it falls onto the galactic disk .",
    "figure [ cap : rotcurve ] shows the rotational velocity of the gas as a function of height above the disk in our mw simulation .",
    "we plot the actual circular rotational speed of the gas averaged over the annulus at the given radii .",
    "( note that this is slightly different to the observations which measure the projected rotational speed at a given radius . )",
    "the central velocity curve has a bump due to the bar formation and the excess of low angular momentum gas in the inner halo .",
    "the decrease in rotational velocity above the plane matches the observations quite well .",
    "this suggests that the observations of fraternali et al .",
    "support the idea that disks form via the cooling flow of gas which is rotating faster closer to the disk by conservation of angular momentum .",
    "in figure [ cap : rotcurve ] we plot the rotational speed of all the gas as a function of position above the disk plane , not just gas in the neutral phase such as measured by fraternali et al . however , in a recent observation of ngc 891 by heald et al .",
    "( 2005 ) it has been found that the velocity gradients of the hot gas agree with the results for the neutral gas . as we then increase the resolution we find that the hot halo is thermally unstable and forms dense gas clouds which then accrete onto the disk .",
    "these clouds may cool down and become partially neutral ( see section 4.2.3 ) .",
    "we only achieve the resolution necessary to observe this two phase medium in our m33 model ( see figure [ cap : rotation - curves - m33 ] for the corresponding velocity plot ) but such clouds would occur also in the mw model if we had sufficient resolution .",
    "unfortunately , due to the higher baryonic density in the centre of the mw model this simulation is much more demanding computationally since particles require shorter time steps .",
    "the cool clouds in the m33 rotate at comparable speed as all the gas , which justifies the measurement of the kinematics within all the gas .",
    "the determination of the velocity gradient from the cold clouds alone was only possible in the inner region , because there were too few clouds at higher @xmath62 in the standard m33 model , but we get a comparable number as if we take all the gas in the plane ( figure [ cap : rotation - curves - m33 ] ) .",
    "figure [ press - sup ] shows that the hot gas halo can not preserve pressure - support for an eos with cooling .",
    "the infall of the hot gas is therefore expected .",
    "the hydrodynamical forces due to diffuse hot corona on the infalling gas are substantial : the infall velocity in the m33 galaxy of the gas above the disk is approximately @xmath52 km / s .",
    "this is much smaller than the pure free - fall velocity towards the disk , @xmath63 km / s , this radial infall velocity agrees well with that observed by fraternali et al . ( 2002 ) of approximately @xmath64 km / s for ngc 2403 , a galaxy similar to m33 . in figure [ press - grav ]",
    "we show the ratio between pressure ( hydrodynamical ) and gravitational accelerations perpendicular to the disk for some gas particles @xmath65 kpc above the disk .",
    "the pressure forces can equilibrate the gravitational forces in average at the @xmath66 level , which results in this lowered infall velocity .",
    "the result for particles which are e.g. @xmath11 kpc above the disk is similar .",
    "maller and bullock ( 2004 , hereafter mb04 ) proposed that disks form via the accretion of warm clouds that develop from thermal instabilities in the hot gaseous halo ( see also mo & miralda - escude 1996 ) .",
    "this instability arises as small density fluctuations cool faster than most of the surrounding gas ; cooling amplifies these density fluctuations further and the instability rapidly grows . according to mb04 this clumpy formation of disk galaxies",
    "would at the same time explain the existence of high velocity clouds and give rise to a characteristic upper limit on the masses of galaxies consistent with observations .",
    "typical parameters for the clouds in a milky way - sized halo today would be a size of @xmath67 kpc and a characteristic cloud mass of @xmath68 m@xmath2 .",
    "several physical mechanisms , e.g. the kelvin - helmholtz instability and conduction , impose a lower mass limit on clouds that can survive ( see below ) .",
    "these clouds have not been found in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation since even the highest resolution studies have a single sph particle mass equal to the expected characteristic cloud mass ( governato et al .",
    "2004 ; sommer - larsen et al . 2003 ) .      in the m33 model we can achieve a higher resolution since the lower density cold component requires less computational work . in the standard m33 model",
    "the force resolution is @xmath13 pc or @xmath69 of the virial radius and the sph particle mass is @xmath70 m@xmath2 .",
    "these simulations produce a large population of warm ( @xmath71 k ) high - density , pressure - confined clouds that are forming within the hot ( @xmath72 k ) gaseous halo ( see figures [ cap : contours ] and [ cap : blobs ] ) .",
    "these clouds eventually cool down to the temperature floor in our cooling function and would contain substantial fractions of neutral hydrogen .",
    "we will discuss the behaviour below the temperature floor in section [ belowten ] .",
    "these clouds are in pressure equilibrium with the halo gas - their gravitational binding energy is typically @xmath73 times smaller than the thermal energy , hence the clouds are not gravitationally bound . the clouds have radii of @xmath74 kpc and masses from @xmath75 to a few @xmath76 m@xmath29 as expected , a lower number of clouds is found for a higher number of particles in the sph smoothing kernel , but at the standard resolution we still see a cloud smoothing over @xmath77 neighbours ( table 1 ) .",
    "the parameters of the different simulations and the properties of the clouds are shown in table 1 .",
    "the thermal instability starts because of small density fluctuations present in the initial sph particle distribution .",
    "these fluctuations rapidly grow , increasing in size and density until a pressure confined cold cloud forms . in reality",
    "these fluctuations might be driven by external perturbations , for example infall of cold gas and substructure or turbulence induced by supernova winds from disk stars or a galactic fountain .",
    "the temperature fluctuations are clearly visible throughout the gaseous halo in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ cap : tempblobs ] .",
    "these cold pressure confined clouds are seen only within about @xmath52 to @xmath11 kpc from the disk .",
    "this may be an sph resolution effect - further out in the halo the gas density is lower and the sph smoothing length is much larger .",
    "thus density and temperature fluctuations are suppressed by the smoothing .",
    "one of the conditions for cloud formation is that the sound - crossing time , @xmath78 across a perturbation of wavelength @xmath79 should be less than the characteristic cooling time ( mb04 ) . if this condition is not satisfied the perturbation is erased because the local cooling time is too close to the mean cooling time and the whole region becomes isothermal . in our simulations",
    "we can resolve perturbations in the gas to @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the smoothing length in the sph code .",
    "we tested this condition in regions around the disk ( @xmath11 kpc from the centre ) where no clouds formed and found that @xmath82 ) even at quite low temperatures ( @xmath83 k ) . for regions where clouds form , the condition @xmath84 is fulfilled where the values of the smoothing length @xmath85 kpc .    in order to assess the growth rates and resolution dependence of the instability we performed simple tests using sph particles distributed randomly in a 10 kpc periodic cube with initial temperature ( @xmath86 k ) and density ( @xmath87 @xmath88 ) comparable to those from the central region of the halo models .",
    "we ran three simulations with particle masses 1 , 1/10th and 1/100th times those in the full halo simulations .",
    "we found cold gas clouds forming above the 32 particle sph smoothing kernel which grow linearly with time and mass ( see figure [ cubes ] ) .",
    "the higher resolution simulations produce the smallest clouds since they have lower average poisson fluctuations .",
    "after @xmath89 gyr the whole box thermalises as the medium surrounding the clouds has had time to cool down to roughly the same temperature of the clouds . at this point",
    "the clouds dissolve into the outer medium since they are not pressure confined any more and the instability saturates .",
    "we can compare the growth rates to those in burkert & lin ( 2000 ) , which derived a condition for exponential versus linear growth in a static , thermally unstable gas layer : the ratio of the initial cooling to sound - crossing time - scale @xmath90 has to be larger than the critical value @xmath91 where @xmath92 @xmath93 and where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the characteristic cooling time scale at time @xmath96 , wavenumber , gas constant , initial temperature , mean molecular weight , adiabatic index , and the exponent of the power law of the cooling rate , respectively .",
    "@xmath97 is the initial perturbation amplitude and @xmath98 the initial mean density .",
    "the paper by katz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) shows the cooling rate of a primordial composition gas ( as is used in gasoline ) , for @xmath99 a power law with @xmath100 gives a rough approximation ; with @xmath101 we find @xmath102 for simulation with the @xmath103 overdensity .",
    "for @xmath90 we get @xmath104 using @xmath105 gyr , @xmath106 k and taking two times the mean smoothing length as the smallest wavelength which is resolved ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "therefore the calculated @xmath90 is not a mean @xmath90 but the maximal one , it s value is roughly two times bigger than the critical value , however the mass ( and density ) growth remain linear over several cooling times ( figure [ ovdcubes ] ) .",
    "an additional reason for this may be because around @xmath75 k the real cooling curve decreases over several ten thousands of kelvin and would therefore damp an instability .",
    "the thermal instability generated in the cubes is purely of numerical origin since it is seeded by the initial poisson fluctuations .",
    "a higher resolution setup simply starts with lower amplitude of the initial fluctuations , hence the different mass of the transient clouds formed .",
    "the following step is thus to impose a perturbation and study how the system responds when we increase the resolution .",
    "this way we can assess robustly the dependence on resolution since the initial perturbation is independent on resolution .",
    "we used the cubes with particle masses 1/10th and 1/100th times those in the full halo simulations . to wash out initial poisson noise",
    "the cubes were evolved for @xmath108 gyr using an isothermal eos ( with the same temperatures and mean density as before ) .",
    "then we placed a spherical overdensity at an arbitrary location within the box .",
    "we run three different models where the overdensity was on the @xmath103 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 level , respectively , at both resolutions .",
    "we find that the mass of the clouds in this case , just before the whole box thermalises , differs roughly by the same factor as the initial overdensity , the growth rate is linear in time as in the previous cube tests , and the results in the two resolutions nearly converge ( see figure [ ovdcubes ] ) .",
    "in passing we note that the results at @xmath111 gyr probably overestimate slightly the cooled mass due to the overdensity , because in the next time - step the whole box has already thermalised .",
    "the fact that we found nearly convergent results has important implications for the collapse simulations that we discuss below .",
    "in fact the intermediate resolution test has particles masses comparable to the `` refined_8 '' m33 simulation , which should thus have enough resolution to properly resolve the thermal instability for an initial amplitude of the fluctuations @xmath103 or higher .",
    "so far we had built - in or imposed perturbations as seeds for the thermal instability .",
    "we can ask if there is a reasonable way of producing perturbations of order 10% or larger , namely of the same magnitude of those existing in the initial conditions of the full simulations . one way these perturbations can be produced is by dark matter and baryonic substructure in galactic halos .",
    "we carried out an additional test run using the hires periodic cube .",
    "we added a massive particle with characteristic size ( i.e. gravitational softening ) and mass comparable to the magellanic clouds",
    ". the particle moves through the box at a speed of @xmath112 km / s as expected for a dwarf galaxy satellite orbiting in the milky way halo .",
    "starting with an isothermal eos we saw that the particle rapidly triggered the formation of a trailing overdensity well above @xmath109 of the background density just behind . evolved with cooling this overdensity grew considerably faster than the fluctuations due to numerical noise , as expected from its larger amplitude .",
    "clearly we have chosen a favourable case , since most of the galactic satellites are lighter than the lmc and would drive weaker perturbations .",
    "triggering of gas density fluctuations by substructure in a cdm halo should indeed be dominated by the many dark satellites at least 100 times lighter than the lmc .",
    "individually , these would drive perturbations that are too small to grow significantly on a dynamical time .",
    "however , perturbations presumably would not be isolated but would interact , possibly amplifying more rapidly than expected from the linear growth .",
    "this is already suggested by the fact that clouds in the full simulations grow faster than in the cube tests due to merging .",
    "the presence of a clumpy medium near the disk , which we invoked to explain the observations of fraternali et al . in previous sections , would suggest that there must be a source of the perturbations acting near the disk , fairly isotropic and active even at the present epoch .",
    "whilst satellite accretion of fly byes may have been frequent enough early in the galaxy formation process to be a major source of perturbations near the disk , other mechanisms are probably responsible for triggering the thermal instability today .",
    "galactic fountains driving turbulence in the inner part of the hot gaseous corona might be one possibility .",
    "we will address the question on the physical origin of those perturbations in an upcoming paper .",
    "there are important differences between all the cube tests performed and the full simulation .",
    "one that we just mentioned is that in the full simulations clouds can grow faster due to mergers with other nearby clouds ( see figure [ cubes ] ) .",
    "another one is that the perturbations are not growing out of a static gaseous background as in the cubes but within infalling hot gas .",
    "the static case was recently investigated in baek et al .",
    "( 2005 ) where a perturbation at the @xmath109 level was used to produce clouds with masses of about @xmath113 m@xmath2 using a grid code . in a similar spirit , fall & rees ( 1985 ) showed that an initial density perturbation of the order @xmath103 of the average density is needed to produce clouds with masses comparable to those of globular clusters in an infalling medium .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in the full simulations the initial perturbations are larger than @xmath103 , so that one expects the thermal instability to be able to produce fairly massive clouds .",
    "in order to test the effects of resolution directly in the full simulations we have run two simulations with particle splitting .",
    "first we carried out the refined_8 m33 simulation .",
    "particles within the refined sphere of 30 kpc reach the disk in about @xmath114 gyr . by running the simulation only up to @xmath115 gyr",
    "we make sure that there is no contamination of heavier particles in the disk , which can lead to spurious results ( kitsionas 2000 ) .",
    "the splitting scheme should preserve the amplitude of perturbations at large scales that were present in the original simulation , while noise at previously unresolved scales should trigger the formation of smaller clouds .",
    "after @xmath9 gyr ( see figure [ cap : blobs ] and table [ cap : tab mass 2 ] ) there are about @xmath116 resolved clouds with mean mass @xmath117 m@xmath2 , up to @xmath118 kpc from the centre .",
    "the most massive cloud has a mass of @xmath119 m@xmath2 , which is comparable to the most massive cloud ( @xmath120 m@xmath2 ) in the standard m33 simulation _ at the same time_. we then performed an even higher resolution run by splitting the initial particle distribution by an additional factor of 4 . in the refined_32",
    "there were more than @xmath121 clouds having more than @xmath42 particles due to the smaller perturbations .",
    "the large - scale perturbations were followed similarly in all these three simulations , resulting in a comparable mass distribution of the clouds at the high mass tail , see figure [ umgm ] .",
    "the satisfactory convergence at the scales resolved by all simulations is not a trivial result ; it shows that the amplification of the perturbations is numerically robust even in complex simulations such as these in which the gas density does not change simply because the local cooling rate changes but also as a result of compressions and shocks driven by the gravitational collapse . in other words only the initial amplitude of the fluctuations is not self - consistently determined .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the standard m33 run , a typical compact cloud has a mass of @xmath122 m@xmath2 and a temperature equal to the cut - off temperature in the cooling function ( @xmath123 k ) , radius @xmath124 kpc and lifetime of @xmath125 gyr ( from formation to entering the disk ) .",
    "we now investigate the mechanisms that could disrupt or modify the structure of cold clouds embedded in a hot medium .      as a cool , dense cloud moves through a hot , tenuous background ,",
    "the interface between the two phases is subject to the growth of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities . at our resolution",
    ", sph does not resolve such instabilities due to smoothing and the artificial viscosity which tends to blur any sharp interface between the inner and outer medium .",
    "in other words , the reynolds number is always lower than the reynolds number expected in turbulent flows where the kelvin - helmholtz instability can develop ( see mayer et al .",
    "for the case in which gravity is unimportant murray et al .",
    "( 1993 ) derive a characteristic growth time for the instability of @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the relative velocity and @xmath128 is the density of the background medium .",
    "the clouds are therefore expected to break up on time - scales comparable to @xmath129 . in their numerical experiments they actually found that the mass loss was still quite small over timescales twice as long as @xmath130 in our simulations the density contrast is @xmath131 , the relative velocity @xmath127 is @xmath132 km / s and therefore we end up with @xmath133 gyr using @xmath134 kpc for the radius of the cloud . since such timescale is longer than the typical lifetime of the clouds we expect the effect of the kelvin - helmholtz instability to be negligible .",
    "the radial infall velocities is of the order @xmath52 km / s which is insufficient to perturb the cloud structure .",
    "as the halo gas density becomes lower we might expect clouds to infall faster .",
    "observations of the radial motion of clouds could therefore be used to constrain the ambient halo density .      in principle , conduction can prevent the growth of small clouds .",
    "mb04 suggest random magnetic fields reduce conduction by at least an order of magnitude ( the reduction could be much stronger if the field is uniform or tangled ) setting a minimum cloud mass of about @xmath135 m@xmath2 for a galaxy with mass comparable to that in our m33 model . for the standard simulation presented here ,",
    "the conduction limit thus lies below the resolution limit imposed by the sph smoothing volume ( and slightly above the resolution limit for the simulation with splitting in 32 particles .",
    "the number of small clouds is therefore expected to be lowered due to conduction ) . at very high resolution , conduction would provide a natural cut - off scale and allow detailed numerical convergence .",
    "although we used a lower cut - off in the cooling function to prevent fragmentation it is interesting to investigate the fate of the clouds below that temperature . in order to do that we used a `` standard ''",
    "cooling function ( e.g. dalgarno & mccray 1972 ) to derive an estimate for the cooling timescale of the clouds below @xmath136 k. we adopted the parameterisation of gerritsen & icke ( 1997 ) for the temperature range of @xmath137 :    @xmath138\\ ] ]    in ergs @xmath139 s@xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 depend on the ionisation parameter @xmath143 the heating term for photoelectric heating of small grains and pahs ( as the largest contributor to the gas heating ) is given as @xmath144 in ergs @xmath139 s@xmath140 where @xmath145 is the heating efficiency and @xmath146 the incident far - ultraviolet field ( bakes & tielens 1994 ) .",
    "the fuv field originates from star formation in the disk ; since we are resolving only clouds very close to the disk we can simply assume that they will be embedded in the same bath of ionising photons as the rest of the galaxy .",
    "with @xmath147 ( hernquist & katz 1989 ) one can give an estimate of the cooling time for such systems neglecting pressure and velocity terms . a typical cloud in our simulation",
    "can cool down during its lifetime to several tens of kelvin for ionisation parameters @xmath148 in less than @xmath115 myr , for @xmath149 an equilibrium is reached at several thousand kelvin .",
    "the dynamical time - scale @xmath150 myr for such a cloud is of order of its lifetime .",
    "therefore the clouds could collapse further for @xmath148 ( a value which should be reasonable for the solar neighbourhood , see cox 1990 ) . on the other hand mb04",
    "find that the extragalactic ionising background should prevent the cooling of the clouds below @xmath151 .",
    "self - shielding effects will also be important to decide the ultimate fate of the clouds under the combined action of different heating and cooling mechanisms .",
    "had we included metals in the simulations the cooling rate would have been higher .",
    "we crudely explored the effect of metals by simply shifting the entire cooling curve up .",
    "we found , as expected , that more efficient cooling leads to a larger number of clouds for a given resolution ; doubling the energy loss due to cooling ( this modified cooling function is somewhere in between primordial gas and gas with solar metalicity ) increased the mass and the number in clouds by a factor of order @xmath152 whereas the mass per cloud and the spatial extent of the clouds remained comparable .",
    "we studied the cooling flow of gas within equilibrium dark plus gaseous haloes . at high resolution",
    "the gas nearly conserves angular momentum and rotates faster as it moves towards the disk . within @xmath153 kpc from the disk the gas fragments into cold gas clouds pressure confined by the ambient hot halo gas .",
    "the clumpy appearance of the gas matches hi observations of outer disks .",
    "these cold clouds have similar properties as predicted in analytic models such as that of mb04 . however , one difference with mb04 is that the hot gas component is never in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium once it starts cooling and collapsing .",
    "this implies , for example , that the disk assembly will occur faster than predicted by a model such as mb04 .",
    "the mass of galaxies with a given spin should also be different , presumably higher in our case since there is less pressure support against collapse .",
    "unfortunately a direct comparison in terms of galaxy masses is not possible at this stage since the refined runs that have enough resolution to properly follow the clumpy disk formation have been run only for a very short timescale .",
    "the background gas cools and falls in towards the disk as it loses pressure support .",
    "its radial infall velocity is comparable to that of the cold clouds .",
    "this explains why we do not see significant differences in the mass growth of the disk when we compare simulations which yield a very different degree of clumpiness of the accretion flow such as the standard and refined_32 simulations . in our models",
    "the amount of hot gas which is accreted directly to the disk is substantial , however , even after @xmath108 gyr , there is a residual hot gas halo , such that a large mass fraction of the baryons remain in the halo .",
    "the gas does not accrete onto the disk via a spherically symmetric flow .",
    "rather it flows down a cylindrical fashion along the angular momentum axis .",
    "this is different from that assumed in semi - analytic models for disk formation .",
    "the rotational velocity of the gas decreases above the disk plane with a similar velocity gradient as observed in the measurements for ngc 891 by fraternali et al .",
    ". this may be the first evidence for disk formation via radiative cooling of hot gas combined with conservation of angular momentum .",
    "our simulations show that the thermal instability , and thus the two - phase medium , requires a continuous heating source to be present in order to be maintained , and this is provided here by the gravitational collapse which continously brings in gas hotter than the gas that has already cooled down . when this heating term is not present , such as in all the cube tests , the instability is rapidly suppressed as the temperature becomes uniform due to the high cooling rate .",
    "we believe that the clouds are stable against the various disruption mechanisms such as conduction and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "the infall velocity of the gas is approximately @xmath52 km / s .",
    "this is much smaller than the pure free - fall velocity towards the disk , @xmath63 km / s , owing to the drag exerted by the diffuse hot corona .",
    "this velocity can thus be used to measure the ambient hot gas density above the disk plane .",
    "this radial infall velocity agrees well with that observed by fraternali et al .",
    "( 2002 ) of approximately @xmath64 km / s for ngc 2403 , a galaxy similar to m33 .    in the refined_32 simulation",
    "the sky coverage factor of the clouds is approximately 25% .",
    "this is quite similar to the sky coverage factor of high column density high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) ( richter 2006 ) .",
    "the number of cold clouds in our ( refined_32 ) simulation is also similar to those estimated by putman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . however , we caution against over - interpreting these intriguing results",
    ". in our model several physical ingredients that might have an impact on cloud formation , such as gas metalicity , and survival ( such as conduction ) are still missing , and the initial perturbations are still not determined self - consistently in the mode .",
    "it is interesting that cosmological simulations are now beginning to resolve similar structures ( governato et al .",
    "2006 , sommer - larsen 2006 ) and that the origin of the perturbations in some of these simulations seems to be dense cold gaseous streams accreted in the process of galaxy formation ( sommer - larsen 2006 ) .",
    "if cold accretion is responsible for the cloud formation it would have the benefit of being a very general mechanism , although it would occur preferentially in the early stages of their formation for systems as large as the milky way today ( kere et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the growth rate of the cloud masses is approximately linear with time , therefore large initial fluctuations in temperature or density are required .",
    "it is likely that the poisson fluctuations due to discreteness , which are at the 10% level , are coincidentally close to the amplitude of fluctuations required to form @xmath4 m@xmath2 clouds within a gyr . in addition to perturbations of cosmological origin for the clouds to be connected with hvcs one needs mechanisms that are efficient at any epoch , such as triggering by halo substructure .",
    "this includes not only the direct perturbation of sub - haloes moving in the primary halo but also cold gas streams stripped from the baryonic component of the satellites ( mayer et al .",
    "2006 ) . finally , in order to generate the hi clouds in the extra planar gas around disks one needs also local sources of fluctuations such as infalling cold gas or turbulence induced by gravitational perturbations or supernova winds from star formation in the disk",
    "a lot remains to be done to study the role of these different triggering mechanisms which might be simultaneously at play and generate various populations of clouds .",
    "we would like to thank stelios kazantzidis for providing a code to generate isolated dark matter haloes and filippo fraternali for the rotation curve data for ngc 891 .",
    "we acknowledge useful and stimulating discussions with filippo fraternali , renzo sancisi , frank van den bosch , kenneth sembach , leo blitz , tom quinn , fabrizio brighenti and fabio governato .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for his remarks and stimulating comments that considerably improved the paper .",
