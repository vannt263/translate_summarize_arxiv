    "one of the most controversial topics in the field of high - temperature superconductivity is the origin of the so - called pseudogap phenomenon observed by various experimental techniques in the underdoped cuprates ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . a large number of theoretical scenarios have been proposed to explain the origin of the pseudogap @xcite . among these",
    "is the @xmath2-density wave ( ddw ) scenario @xcite which was suggested to explain some of the salient features of the underdoped cuprates such as the @xmath1-wave symmetry of the pseudogap above t@xmath0 , the anomalous behavior of the superfluid density@xcite and of the hall number@xcite , as well as the presence of weak ( orbital ) antiferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "the ddw - phase is characterized by circulating bond currents which alternate in space , break time - reversal symmetry and result in an orbital ( antiferromagnetically ordered ) magnetic moment .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the momentum and frequency dependence of the dynamical spin susceptibility , @xmath6 , in the underdoped region of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "in particular , we compare the formation of a resonant spin excitation ( the  resonance peak \" ) in three different ordered states : the ddw phase , the @xmath1-wave superconducting ( dsc ) phase , and a phase with coexisting ddw and dsc order .",
    "the observation of the resonance peak in inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments @xcite is one of the key experimental facts in the phenomenology of the high - t@xmath7 cuprates . in the optimally and overdoped cuprates",
    ", the resonance peak appears below t@xmath7 in the dynamical spin susceptibility at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath8 . in the optimally",
    "doped cuprates , the resonance s frequency is @xmath9 mev @xcite , a frequency which decreases with increasing underdoping @xcite . a number of theoretical scenarios have been suggested for the appearance of the resonance peak in a superconducting state with @xmath1-wave symmetry @xcite . in one of them , the so - called spin exciton scenario @xcite , the resonance peak is attributed to the formation of a particle - hole bound state below the spin gap ( a spin exciton ) , which is made possible by the specific momentum dependence of the @xmath1-wave gap . within this scenario ,",
    "the structure of spin excitations in the superconducting state as a function of momentum and frequency can be directly related to the topology of the fermi surface and the phase of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "this scenario agrees well with the experimental data in the superconducting state of the optimally and overdoped cuprates . in the underdoped cuprates the resonance - like peak has also been observed in the pseudogap region above t@xmath0 as well as in the superconducting state @xcite . in this article",
    ", we address the question whether in the underdoped cuprates , the resonance peak above t@xmath0 emerges from the presence of a ddw state , as first suggested by tewari _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and below t@xmath0 from the coexistence of a dsc and ddw phase . to answer this question",
    ", we develop a spin exciton scenario for the pure ddw - phase as well as the coexisting dsc and ddw phases . by studying the detailed momentum and frequency dependence of the resonance peak in both phases , and by comparing it with that in the pure dsc state",
    ", we identify several characteristic features of the resonance peak that allow one to distinguish between the underlying phases , in which the resonance peak emerges .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in secs .",
    "[ secddw ] and [ secddwdsc ] we discuss the form of the resonance peak in the pure ddw phase and the coexisting ddw and dsc phase , respectively , and compare it with that in the pure dsc state . in sec .",
    "[ secconcl ] we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "starting point for our calculations in the pure ddw - state is the effective mean field hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath3 is the ordering wavevector of the ddw state , @xmath11 is the ddw order parameter , @xmath12 is the normal state tight - binding energy dispersion with @xmath13 being the hopping elements between nearest and next - nearest neighbors , respectively , and @xmath14 is the chemical potential . in the following we use @xmath15mev , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the fermi surface ( fs ) obtained from eq .",
    "( [ nsdisp ] ) describes well the fs measured by photoemission experiments on bi@xmath18sr@xmath18cacu@xmath18o@xmath19  @xcite . in order to directly compare the dynamical spin susceptibility in the ddw state with that in the dsc state ,",
    "we take the ddw order parameter , @xmath20mev , to be equal to that in the dsc state @xcite .",
    "we note here , that the above hamiltonian can be obtained from a microscopic hamiltonian with short - range repulsion or superexchange interactions @xcite .",
    "after diagonalizing the hamiltonian , eq.([hamddw ] ) , one finds that the excitation spectrum possesses two bands with energy dispersion @xmath21 where @xmath22 . in fig.[fig1](a ) we present the resulting fermi surface in the ddw phase .",
    "due to the doubling of the unit cell in the ddw state , the fermi surface consists of hole pockets centered around @xmath23 and electron pockets around @xmath24 ) and ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this type of fermi surface has not yet been observed experimentally in the underdoped cuprates , possibly , as has recently been argued , due to additional interactions between quasiparticles @xcite . for the above band parameters , the chemical potential lies within both branches of the excitation spectrum thus preventing the formation of a gap at the fermi level .",
    "this is clearly visible from fig.[fig1](b ) where we plot the density of states ( dos ) for various values of the ddw gap . in particular",
    ", one finds that for @xmath26 a suppression of ( i.e. , dip in ) the dos is formed away from the fermi level which increases with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath28 , this suppression , which we identify with the pseudogap , opens at the fermi level as was noted previously@xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath29 , the dos vanishes at the fermi level , and the dos resembles that of a @xmath1-wave superconductor .    in order to compute the dynamical spin susceptibility in the ddw state",
    ", we first introduce the spinor @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the spin index , and the electronic greens function in the ddw state is defined as @xmath32 .",
    "the bare ( non - interacting ) part of the dynamical spin susceptibility per spin degree of freedom is then given by @xmath33 \\label{bare}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the green s function matrix in momentum and matsubara space@xcite , and the primed sum runs over the reduced fermionic brillouin zone of the ddw state .",
    "note that with the above definition , one has @xmath35 .",
    "after performing the summation over the internal matsubara frequencies and analytic continuation to the real frequency axis , one obtains for the retarded spin susceptibility in the ddw phase    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the fermi function .",
    "we first analyze the behavior of the imaginary part of @xmath38 at @xmath3 , and present in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] im@xmath39 as a function of frequency in the normal state , the dsc state , and the ddw state @xcite ( for the form of @xmath38 in the dsc state , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the behavior of im@xmath40 in the normal and dsc state have been extensively discussed in the literature ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) . in",
    "the normal state im@xmath38 increases linearly at low frequencies with a slope determined by the landau damping rate , while , at higher energies its behavior is determined by the presence of the van hove singularity .",
    "in contrast , in the superconducting state the susceptibility is gapped up to an energy @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the superconducting gap and both @xmath43 and @xmath44 lie on the fermi surface . due to the symmetry of the superconducting gap , one finds @xmath45 , resulting in a discontinuous jump of im@xmath38 at @xmath46 @xcite .    in order to discuss the behavior of im@xmath38 in the ddw - state",
    ", we first note that the expression for @xmath38 in eq.([chi_0 ] ) contains two terms that describe intraband scattering within the @xmath47-bands , and two terms that represent interband scattering between the two bands . since @xmath48 the intraband scattering terms do not contribute to im@xmath38 at @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath49 the first interband scattering term yields a non - zero contribution to im@xmath38 only for negative frequencies .",
    "thus , only the second interband scattering term in eq.([chi_0 ] ) contributes to im@xmath38 at @xmath4 .",
    "since the fermi surfaces of the two energy bands , @xmath47 , can not be connected by the wave vector @xmath4 , as is evident from fig.[fig1](a ) , im@xmath38 is gapped at low frequencies up to an energy @xmath50 mev .",
    "the latter is determined by the minimum value of @xmath51 in the ddw brillouin zone , a condition that is set by the @xmath52-function arising from the last term in eq.([chi_0 ] ) for im@xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath53 along the boundary of the ddw brillouin zone . due to the requirement @xmath54 , we find that @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the momentum at which the hole pocket around @xmath57 is intersected by the ddw brillouin zone boundary ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] )",
    ". moreover , since @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the second coherence factor in eq.([chi_0 ] ) is identical to @xmath60 for all momenta .",
    "note that there exist two important differences in im@xmath38 between the ddw and dsc state .",
    "first , in the dsc state , im@xmath61 requires that the frequency exceeds @xmath62 , a condition which is set by the @xmath52-function in im@xmath38 ( see eq.([chi_0 ] ) ) and simply reflects energy conservation .",
    "in contrast , in the ddw - state , im@xmath61 requires ( a ) that @xmath63 for certain momenta @xmath43 , and ( b ) that for the same momenta @xmath64 .",
    "we find that there exist momenta for which ( a ) is satisfied at frequencies @xmath65 , but that for the same momenta @xmath66 ( at @xmath67 ) .",
    "in other words , the critical frequency @xmath68 for the onset of a non - zero im@xmath38 is determined by the difference in the population of the states that are involved in the scattering process , and not by energy conservation as in the superconducting state .",
    "this qualitative difference between the ddw and the dsc state bears important consequences : for @xmath69 , one has im@xmath70 , in contrast to the discontinuous jump of im@xmath38 at @xmath46 in the dsc state ( this result for the ddw state differs from that in ref .",
    "@xcite due to the different fermi surface topology considered here ) .",
    "this behavior becomes immediately apparent when one plots im@xmath38 in the ddw - state around @xmath71 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "note that the number of momenta which are involved in scattering processes and thus contribute to im@xmath38 rapidly increases for @xmath72 due to a steeply increasing density of states of the function @xmath73 , which gives rise to the peak in im@xmath38 at @xmath74 mev .    for momenta @xmath75 ,",
    "the behavior of im@xmath38 in the ddw state is more complex , since in addition to interband scattering , intraband scattering is now possible . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we plot the frequency dependence of im@xmath38 for several momenta in the ddw state ( for comparison , im@xmath38 in the dsc state is shown in the inset ) . we find that as one moves away from @xmath3 , several square - root - like increases in im@xmath38 appear , with the one lowest in energy rapidly decreasing in frequency . in order to better understand the combined frequency and momentum dependence of im@xmath38 in the ddw state",

    "this result is valid for all momenta @xmath75 in the vicinity of @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , the interband scattering term possesses three critical frequencies , @xmath79 , which arise from the opening of three non - degenerate scattering channels that are described by the scattering momenta shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "these three critical energies are indicated by arrows in fig .",

    "the above form of re@xmath38 implies that @xmath90 now has to exceed a critical value , @xmath101 , before a resonance peak ( in the form of a spin exciton ) can emerge in the ddw state .",
    "we note , however , that the values of @xmath90 typically taken to describe the emergence of a resonance peak in the dsc state of optimally doped cuprate superconductors , exceed @xmath101 , such that a resonance peak also emerges in the ddw state . in other words , for @xmath102 , the resonance conditions @xmath103 and @xmath93 are satisfied in the ddw state at a frequency @xmath104 . as a result ,",

    "<S> we present a study of the dynamical spin susceptibility in the pseudogap region of the high - t@xmath0 cuprate superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze and compare the formation of the so - called resonance peak , in three different ordered states : the @xmath1-wave superconducting ( dsc ) phase , the @xmath2-density wave ( ddw ) state , and a phase with coexisting ddw and dsc order . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the resonance s frequency and momentum dependence in all three states reveals significant differences between them . in particular , in the ddw state , we find that a nearly dispersionless resonance excitation exists only in a narrow region around @xmath3 . at the same time , in the coexisting ddw and dsc state , the dispersion of the resonance peak near @xmath4 is significantly changed from that in the pure dsc state . </S>",
    "<S> away from @xmath5 , however , we find that the form and dispersion of the resonance excitation in the coexisting ddw and dsc state and pure dsc state are quite similar . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that a detailed experimental measurement of the resonance s dispersion allows one to distinguish between the underlying phases - a ddw state , a dsc state , or a coexisting ddw and dsc state - in which the resonance peak emerges . </S>"
