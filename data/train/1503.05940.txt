    "( 16 ) of the main text , with @xmath202 .",
    "this result has a clear physical meaning : the decoherence occurs only provided that at least one of the fluctuators flips .",
    "each flip provides a contribution @xmath203 to the phase , while @xmath204 is a probability for a flip during the observation time .",
    "the result for @xmath205 is less intuitive since in this region the dephasing is non - markovian , see  @xcite for more details .",
    "it is important that at large observation times , @xmath206 , the decoherence is dominated by few _",
    "optimal _ fluctuators .",
    "the distance @xmath207 , between the optimal fluctuators and the qubit is determined by the condition @xmath208 this estimate emerges naturally from the behavior of the decoherence in the limiting cases @xmath189 and @xmath187 . for strong coupling",
    "the fluctuators are slow and the qubit s behavior is determined by quantum beatings between the states with @xmath209 .",
    "accordingly , the decoherence rate is of he order of @xmath162 . in the opposite case ,",
    "as we already discussed , the decoherence rate is @xmath210 . matching these two limiting cases one arrives at the estimate  ( [ eq : aux1 ] ) .",
    "let us discuss possible implications of the results for the suggested tmp .",
    "we start with the case of a single strong fluctuator . in principle",
    ", one can tune the qubit ( i.e. , the manipulation frequency ) to @xmath211 using the tmp . note , however , that such a tuning would be temperature - dependent since @xmath212 generally depends on temperature through the fluctuator s occupation numbers .",
    "therefore , it may happen that tuning should be made for each temperature .",
    "as we have discussed , the behavior of @xmath213 depends on one dimensionless parameter , @xmath214 . in both cases theory predicts decay , that corresponds to the lorentzian spectrum . however , the decay rates in the different regimes are very different depending on temperature . in the case of a  weak \" fluctuator ,",
    "the decay rate is @xmath215 , cf . with eq .  , where @xmath216 , see eq .",
    ", is increasing with temperature ( the typical dependence is @xmath217 ) .    at low temperatures one can expect the parameter @xmath214 to become large .",
    "in this regime one can expect damped beatings with frequency @xmath179 , see eq .",
    ", the decay rate being @xmath162 . in principle",
    ", one can find the coupling strength , @xmath179 , from the beatings frequency .",
    "if a crossover between the regimes is experimentally feasible , then one can be sure that at the crossover point the fluctuator is _ optimal _ in the sense of eq .",
    ", i.e. ,  it is the most harmful .",
    "if the decoherence is produced by many fluctuators ( @xmath122-noise ) we have to study eq .  , which also predicts a temperature - dependent crossover at @xmath218 . at low temperatures and relatively small delay times , @xmath219 ,",
    "the predicted decay is gaussian . the predicted decay rate in this case , @xmath220 .",
    "note that @xmath198 is proportional the number of fluctuators with @xmath221 , therefore @xmath222 . at higher temperatures a crossover to the case @xmath223 takes place . in this - non - markovian - regime , the predicted decay is exponential , the decay rate being @xmath224 .",
    "the above discussion holds for the situation when the fluctuators are evenly distributed in a 3d device and the interaction between the qubit and the fluctuators decays @xmath200 .",
    "if the fluctuators are formed close to some low - dimensional surface , then the situation can be more diverse .",
    "typically , in that case a small group of fluctuators becomes dominant , the decoherence is non - gaussian , and pronounced mesoscopic fluctuations of the decoherence time can be expected .",
    "generally , the behavior of the decay can be accounted assuming that there is one or few strong fluctuators and applying expressions for a single fluctuator , see more details in  @xcite .",

    "<S> this is natural , as we have shown that for @xmath106 , @xmath107 for the parameters in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , see eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> on the contrary , in all cases @xmath98 stays around unity within the statistical scatter .    </S>",
    "<S> one obtains further insight of the differences between @xmath0 and @xmath9 by inspecting the actual probability distributions of internal energy and work under the given driving protocol . both ratios @xmath108 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath109 can obtain integer values . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] varying the delay time @xmath6 between the second rotation and the final measurement . </S>",
    "<S> there are several important conclusions to draw from the dependencies in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the probabilities @xmath110 relax with time @xmath6 since @xmath0 measures the internal energy which changes after the non - equilibrium driving . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the waiting period @xmath6 does not influence @xmath111 since there is no work done after the second rotation pulse . </S>",
    "<S> these dependences are consistent with our basic expectations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also recover the important crooks fluctuation relation for work @xcite in the form @xmath112 for those values of work that are within the reach in this situation ( for @xmath113 ) . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath114 is not constant in @xmath6 and thus does not satisfy a fluctuation relation .     and @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the same protocol as before with @xmath92 , @xmath116 , @xmath97 , and @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> we vary the delay time of the second measurement , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines refer to @xmath0 and the dashed ones to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we employed @xmath117 repetitions of the protocol for each data point . ]    neglecting time dependence of @xmath73 during the time interval @xmath8 and assuming a gaussian distribution of @xmath73 with vanishing mean and width @xmath118 we obtain @xmath119\\,\\gamma_\\sigma \\tanh^2(\\beta\\hbar\\omega_0/2).\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath120 is directly related to @xmath121 , which is the decay rate for @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the dephasing rate of the qubit during the time interval @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> a realistic source of decoherence caused by a low - frequency noise is discussed in the supplemental material , sec .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider so - called random telegraph noise created by a two - state dynamic degree of freedom in the environment , as well as @xmath122-noise produced by overlap of many degrees of freedom , see  @xcite for a general review and  @xcite for a review on qubits . </S>",
    "<S> experiments  @xcite on josephson qubits have indicated that charged defects may be responsible for the @xmath122 noise .    </S>",
    "<S> another mechanism of decoherence is a back - action of the measuring device , see , e.g. ,  @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the decoherence rate can be related to the so - called _ accessible information _ , i.e. , the information gained in the measurement process , see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein . if this decoherence mechanism is dominant , eq .   </S>",
    "<S> allows relating thermodynamics of the qubit to the accessible information gained by the detector . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the exact relationship between the decoherence and the accessible information depends on the detector type and the measurement protocol .    </S>",
    "<S> the decoherence and thermodynamics can be related to the mutual information also in the case when decoherence is due to interaction with fluctuators , but only when one is able to measure both the qubit and the fluctuators . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between decoherence and mutual information has been analyzed for a qubit interacting with a single fluctuator coupled to phonon environment  @xcite .    to summarize , we have studied the distribution of both the internal energy @xmath0 and the work @xmath9 done on a qubit in a driven non - equilibrium protocol under weak dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we relate the non - equilibrium thermodynamic relations to decoherence rates . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the common fluctuation relations are satisfied for @xmath9 , but not for @xmath0 which is the quantity measured in the two - measurement protocol , tmp . </S>",
    "<S> our results allow one to evaluate the validity of , e.g. , the jarzynski equality from measurements of the internal energy @xmath0 rather than of the total work @xmath9 . from the opposite point of view , if the average @xmath46 is measured , one can use the results for studying dephasing of the qubit via such a statistical measurement .    </S>",
