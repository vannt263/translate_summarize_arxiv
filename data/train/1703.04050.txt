    "our goal is to determine the set of all eigenvalues of problem .",
    "fortunately we are able to offer a complete description of this set ( see theorem 3.1 below ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this nice result is due to the fact that operator @xmath27 is nonhomogeneous ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the homogeneous case ( @xmath28 ) is more delicate .",
    "for example , if @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , then the eigenvalue set of the corresponding ( neumann type ) problem is fully known only if @xmath31 ; otherwise , i.e. if @xmath32 , then it is only known that , as a consequence of the ljusternik - schnirelman theory , there exists a sequence of positive eigenvalues of problem with @xmath33 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but this sequence may not constitute the whole eigenvalue set .    note that the ( nonhomogeneous ) case @xmath34 has been considered recently by abreu and madeira in @xcite where the reader can also find some useful historical comments .",
    "they assume weaker conditions on @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in this paper",
    "we extend their result to the case @xmath37 but we restrict ourselves to functions @xmath38 since assuming weaker regularity for these functions leads to similar results without essential changes .",
    "note that the case @xmath39 has been solved in three previous papers , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all these previous contributions are particular cases of the main result of this paper ( theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "our hypotheses @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 will be assumed throughout this paper .",

    "it is also obvious that @xmath44 is an eigenvalue of this problem and the corresponding eigenfunctions are the nonzero constant functions .",
