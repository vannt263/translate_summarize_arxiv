    "the luminosity - metallicity ( ) relation for gas - rich star - forming galaxies is a robust relationship which holds over ten magnitudes in galaxy optical luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the physical basis for this relation has generally been attributed to a mass - metallicity relation for galaxies .",
    "the  relation has also become an important tool to examine the time - evolution of past chemical enrichment and the ( stellar ) mass - metallicity ( ) relation for more massive galaxies at distant epochs , where emission lines at rest - frame optical wavelengths are redshifted into the near - infrared ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the growing body of observations at intermediate- and high - redshifts has led to work on a variety of galaxy formation models and their subsequent predictions for  and  relations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for nearby dwarf irregular and other star - forming dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the corresponding  relation has traditionally been studied at optical wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if systematic uncertainties are minimized , the resulting residuals in the  relation can be used to examine effects of galaxy evolution ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". however , dispersion in the optical  relation is thought to arise from variations in the stellar mass - to - light ratios , which are caused by variations in the current star formation rate ( sfr ) among galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to minimize the effects of these variations , the  relation can be determined at near - infrared ( nir ; 15 ) wavelengths , where the dominant emission arises from the stellar populations .",
    "recent ground - based efforts to determine  and  relations for low - mass systems in the nir have been constructed and described by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the _ spitzer space telescope _ provides an excellent opportunity to observe total emission from the stellar populations in nearby dwarf galaxies , because most of these systems are of intrinsically low surface brightness , and are therefore highly challenging to observe in the nir from the ground ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the 4.5  luminosities are dominated by emission from stellar photospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and are less sensitive to bursts of star formation .",
    "observations at 4.5  were chosen also because the passband was designed to avoid emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "pah emission does not appear to be significant within lower - luminosity metal - poor galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although emission from hot dust might be significant in disk galaxies at 4.5  ( e.g. , @xcite ) , our 8  observations have shown that the contributions from pahs and warm dust are not significant in our sample of low - mass dwarf galaxies @xcite .    in light of the  relation for massive galaxies determined by @xcite , we consider nearby dwarf galaxies , which extend the mass range down by roughly 2.5  dex .",
    "this allows us to examine the  relation over five orders of magnitude in stellar mass . to construct the  and  relations at 4.5  , we have chosen nearby star - forming dwarf irregular galaxies that have distances measured from stellar constituents , and oxygen abundances derived from high - quality spectra ( namely ,  measurements )",

    "@xcite observed a trend between effective yield and h  i - gas - to-@xmath18-light ratio for a sample of nearby ugc dwarf galaxies , where the h  i - gas - to-@xmath18-light ratio was a measure of the gas - to - stellar mass ratio .",
    "these authors ruled out infall of metal - poor gas as a mechanism to decrease effective yields ( see also @xcite ) . in fig .",

    "[ fig_vrot]a , there appears to be a good correlation between stellar mass and rotation velocity ( @xmath83 ) , although there is a paucity of data at low rotation velocity .",
    "the bisector fit is @xmath84 and the dispersion in log stellar mass is 0.63  dex .",
    "the fit can be inverted to give @xmath85 ; the numerical exponent here is larger than the predicted value of 0.2 @xcite by @xmath86 .",
    "the observational result suggests either larger rotation velocities at a given stellar mass , or smaller stellar masses at a given velocity .    in panels ( b ) and",
    "( c ) , respectively , we have plotted the gas - to - stellar mass ratio and the effective yield against rotation velocity .",
    "neither panel reveals a strong trend , although the effective yield appears to rise slightly with rotation velocity .",
    "the rise of the effective yield with rotation velocity has been discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "galaxies with @xmath87 100 km  s@xmath15 have effective yields approaching that of the asymptotic yield .",
    "less massive galaxies with @xmath88 100 km  s@xmath15 have smaller effective yields which are roughly consistent with a solar - type yield , as seen above in fig .  [ fig_yield ] .",
    "the present work suggests that the effective yield may be roughly constant , or at the very least , is weakly dependent upon rotation velocity .",
    "while additional data are required for confirmation , this result suggests that within the mass range of dwarf galaxies , the effective yield depends more strongly upon the relative gas fraction than upon rotation velocity .",
    "we have shown that the scatter in the optical  relation is constant ( @xmath77 0.16  dex ) over a range of 11  mag in @xmath18 luminosity , and the scatter decreases to 0.12  dex over 8  mag at nir wavelengths .",
    "our subsequent stellar mass - metallicity relation extends the dynamic range of the sdss  relation to lower masses by roughly 2.5  dex .",
    "we have also shown that the scatter for the  relation appears to be similar over 5.5  orders of magnitude in stellar mass .",
    "models of galaxy formation have been successful in predicting the slopes of the  and  relations .",
    "these models generally incorporate feedback , which describes how effectively massive stars can inject energy into the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "@xcite predicted the scaling relation , @xmath89 , for dwarf galaxies formed and embedded within dark matter haloes , although their model is less applicable to dwarf galaxies which have undergone a low and constant level of star formation over a hubble time .",
    "the derived slopes of the  relations ( our equation  [ eqn_zlumfits ] ) are in approximate agreement with the @xcite prediction , although our [ 4.5 ]  slope is smaller than the predicted value by about @xmath90 .",
    "recently , @xcite predicted the scaling relation @xmath91 . the slope of the  relation in equation  ( [ eqn_zmstar ] ) is smaller than the predicted value by @xmath92 .",
    "we note , however , that the @xcite scaling relation was derived for stellar iron metallicities under the assumption of constant [ fe / o ] , which may not be applicable in dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite compared predicted  relations among a number of semi - analytical models . although the details varied with the specific feedback recipe within the models , the scatter in the  relations increased with decreasing total luminosity ( their fig .",
    "18 ) . unfortunately",
    ", none of the models provided acceptable fits to all of the known observational parameters , and these authors stated that the failure of the models is likely caused by a strong difference in efficiency between ejecting gas and ejecting metals .",
    "models by @xcite produced  relations consistent with the sdss  relation over a similar range in stellar mass , down to log ( / ) @xmath77 8.5 .",
    "@xcite developed models to describe chemical abundance patterns observed in the galactic halo , local group dwarf spheroidals , and local group dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "they incorporated chemical enrichment histories and various gas accretion histories within cosmologically motivated @xmath93cdm models for the formation of dwarf galaxies and the galactic stellar halo .",
    "their models were able to reproduce the @xcite scaling relation and the observed abundance patterns in nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite explained that the relationship between stellar mass and metallicity was a consequence of the relationship between effective yield and total baryonic mass .",
    "that is , higher - mass systems are able to convert gas into stars which produce galaxies with large stellar masses and metallicities ; whereas , lower - mass systems convert less gas into stars , and lose their metals as outflows by virtue of the lower total masses .",
    "these authors state : ``   it is our view that the strong positive correlation between effective yield and baryonic mass is most naturally explained by the increasing potential barrier that the metal - laden wind must overcome to achieve ` blowout . '  '' in fact , since a number of the low - mass galaxies in our sample do not depart significantly from the  and  relationships and have effective yields close to or exceeding the asymptotic value , it is difficult to explain these relationships as a result of very disruptive blowout events .",
    "present - day galactic winds removing material from low - mass galaxies should have dramatic effects on the properties of such systems .",
    "we consider a prototype dwarf starburst galaxy , ngc  1569 , which is undergoing blowout .",
    "@xcite showed in their _ chandra _ observations that most of the oxygen produced in the starburst is in the enriched outflow .",
    "however , the results from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their table 6 ) and @xcite reveal that at most 2% of the stellar mass is produced in the burst .",
    "although the stellar mass ( @xmath94 ) of ngc  1569 is at the upper end of the range for our sample of dwarf galaxies , an equivalent ngc  1569-like burst would produce a more significant amount of stars in lower - mass systems .",
    "however , this high level of star formation is not presently seen in the other low - mass galaxies from our nearby sample , and certainly not seen in dwarf irregulars within the local group ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we hypothesize that a less energetic form of metal - enhanced mass loss than blowouts could explain the small scatter in the  and relationships .",
    "perhaps the slow loss of metals from an x - ray corona which is fed by individual supernova is sufficient to explain the observed relationships .",
    "since this mechanism is an average over many events instead of depending on a small number of very energetic events , a smaller scatter would arise naturally . a low efficiency of star formation in dwarf irregular galaxies could account for a gentler form of mass loss .",
    "while a number of the more massive dwarf galaxies in the present sample have experienced or will experience an outflow event ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the challenge remains to explain the uniform scatter in both the nir  relation over a range of about 11  magnitudes in luminosity , and the  relation over a range of about 5.5  decades in stellar mass .",
    "we suggest the following lines of research for the near future .",
    "new generations of models for galaxy formation which incorporate varying degrees of galaxy outflows should be able to predict the slope and the scatter in the  and relations .",
    "large uniform surveys of galaxies are required to examine the percentage of stars formed in starbursts as a function of galaxy mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "results derived from the resolved stars in ngc  1569 ( e.g. , @xcite ) are promising , because similar studies will allow us to determine how much stellar mass has formed in the most recent bursts to a lookback time of a few gyr .",
    "additional nir imaging and spectroscopy for a large number of dwarf galaxies within the local volume @xcite can test whether the scatter in the  and  relations is truly comparable to the scatter in the respective relations for massive galaxies . with growing interest in understanding further the stages of galaxy assembly through  and  diagnostics , improved models are crucial in providing further insights into the evolution of local and distant galaxies .",
    "with _ spitzer _ irac imaging , we have derived total near - infrared luminosities for 27 nearby dwarf irregular galaxies at 4.5  .",
    "the near - infrared  relation is constructed using 25 of these galaxies with secure distance and oxygen abundance measurements .",
    "while the slope of the subsequent [ 4.5 ]  relation is slightly smaller than the corresponding optical relations , the dispersion in the near - infrared  relation is reduced compared to the optical  relation .",
    "this result agrees with the expectation that variations in stellar mass - to - light ratios decrease from optical to near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we constructed a  relation , where the stellar masses were derived using color - based stellar mass - to - light ratios and corrected for the chabrier imf .",
    "the  relation for dwarf galaxies extends the sdss  relation by another 2.5  decades .",
    "we find that the dispersion in the  relation is comparable over 5.5  decades in stellar mass .",
