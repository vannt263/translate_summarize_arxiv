    "in recent years , few - nucleon theory based on traditional models for the @xmath0 force had significant success  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a high level of precision for the agreement between @xmath2 and @xmath5 calculations and the corresponding experimental data has been reached in many cases .",
    "such a degree of agreement obtained without any free parameter could promise a description of all properties of few - nucleon systems in the near future by solving the exact faddeev - yakubovsky equations with the inclusion of modern @xmath0 potentials and @xmath2 forces .    however , rather significant disagreements between results of the most exact few - nucleon calculations and experimental data still remain . among all such discrepancies ,",
    "we mention here only the most important ones such as the @xmath6 puzzle in @xmath7 and @xmath8 scattering  @xcite , disagreements at the minima of differential cross sections ( sagara puzzle ) at @xmath9  mev and polarization data for @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath7 , @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath8 scattering .",
    "the strongest discrepancy between current theories and experiments has been found in studies of the short - range @xmath0 correlations in the @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13  @xcite , and @xmath14  @xcite processes .",
    "the strong short - range correlations found in these experiments are likely due to ( at least partially ) a three - body force acting in a space region where two nucleons are close to each other .",
    "therefore , in order to quantitatively describe such correlations , some new types of three - body forces should be introduced .",
    "in addition to these particular problems , there are more fundamental problems in the current theory of nuclear forces , e.g. , strong discrepancies between the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 form factors used in obe models for the description of elastic and inelastic scattering and in the parameterization of @xmath18 and @xmath2 forces  @xcite .",
    "many of these difficulties are attributed to a rather poor knowledge of the short - range behaviour of nuclear forces .",
    "this behaviour was traditionally associated with the vector @xmath19-meson exchange .",
    "however , the characteristic range of this @xmath19-exchange ( for @xmath20  mev ) is equal to about @xmath21  fm , i.e. , is deeply inside the internucleon overlap region .",
    "therefore , the quark structure of nucleons should be important at this short range . within six - quark dynamics in its turn",
    ", it has long been known  @xcite that the mixing of the completely symmetric @xmath22 $ ] component with the mixed - symmetry @xmath23 $ ] component can determine the structure of the whole short - range interaction ( in the @xmath24-wave ) . assuming a reasonable @xmath25 interaction model , many authors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) have demonstrated that this mixture can result in both strong short - range repulsion ( associated mainly with the @xmath26 component ) and intermediate - range attraction ( associated mainly with the above mixed - symmetry @xmath27 component ) .",
    "however , recent studies  @xcite for @xmath0 scattering on the basis of the newly developed goldstone - boson - exchange ( gbe ) @xmath25 interaction have resulted in a purely _ repulsive _ @xmath0 contributions from both @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 $ ] six - quark components .",
    "there is no need to say that any quark - motivated model for the @xmath0 force with @xmath28-exchange between quarks inevitably leads to the well - established yukawa @xmath28-exchange interaction between nucleons at long distances .    trying to solve the above problems ( and to understand more deeply the mechanism for the short - range @xmath0 interaction ) , we suggested to add to the conventional yukawa meson - exchange ( @xmath29-channel ) mechanism ( at intermediate and short ranges ) contributions of @xmath30-channel graphs describing the formation of a dressed six - quark bag in an intermediate state such as @xmath31 or @xmath32@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , due to the change in the symmetry of the six - quark state in the transition from the @xmath0 channel to the intermediate dressed - bag state , the strong scalar @xmath1-field arises around the symmetric @xmath33 bag .",
    "this intensive @xmath1-field squeezes the bag and increases its density .",
    "the high quark density in the symmetric @xmath33 bag enhances meson field fluctuations around the bag and thereby partially restores the chiral symmetry .",
    "therefore , the masses of constituent quarks and @xmath1 mesons decrease . as a result of this phase transition ,",
    "the dressed bag mass decreases considerably ( i.e. , a large gain in energy arises ) , which manifests itself as a strong effective attraction in the @xmath0 channel at intermediate distances .",
    "this attraction can be described in terms of the obe model as the effective @xmath29-channel @xmath1-exchange .",
    "however , more accurate calculations of the intermediate - range @xmath0 interaction  @xcite within the @xmath34-exchange model with the @xmath35 @xmath30-wave interaction have revealed that this @xmath29-channel mechanism can not give a strong intermediate - range attraction in the @xmath0 sector , which is necessary for binding of a deuteron and fitting of @xmath0 phase shifts .",
    "the fact that the conventional @xmath29-channel @xmath34-exchange with the @xmath35 @xmath24-wave interaction and reasonably soft @xmath36 cut - off values can not give the sufficiently strong intermediate - range @xmath0 attraction has also been corroborated by recent independent calculations  @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath29-channel mechanism of the @xmath1 exchange should be replaced by the corresponding @xmath30-channel mechanism .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath30-channel mechanism would generally be much larger due to resonance - like enhancement - channel mechanism can be associated with the direct nuclear reaction where only a few degrees of freedom are important , while the @xmath30-channel mechanism can be associated with resonance - like ( or compound nucleus like ) nuclear reactions with much larger cross sections at low energies . ]",
    "based on this @xmath30-channel mechanism , we proposed a new model for the @xmath0 interaction ( referred to as the `` dressed bag model '' ( dbm ) )  @xcite that provides a quite good description of both @xmath0 phase shifts up to 1  gev and the deuteron structure .",
    "the developed model includes both the conventional @xmath29-channel contributions ( yukawa @xmath28 and @xmath34-exchanges ) at long and intermediate distances and the @xmath30-channel contributions due to the formation of intermediate dressed - bag states at short distances .",
    "the most important distinction of such an approach from conventional models for nuclear forces is the explicit presence of a non - nucleonic component in the total wavefunction of the system , which necessarily implies the presence of new three - body forces ( 3bf ) of several kinds in the @xmath2 system .",
    "these new three - body forces differ from conventionally used models for three - body forces .",
    "one important aspect of the three - body force should be emphasized here . in conventional obe models",
    ", the main contribution to @xmath0 attraction is due to the @xmath29-channel @xmath1 exchange .",
    "however , the three - body force models suggested until now ( such as urbana - illinois or tucson - melbourne ) are mainly based on the two - pion exchange with intermediate @xmath37-isobar production , and the @xmath1-exchange either is not taken into account or is of little importance in these models .",
    "in contrast , @xmath1-exchange in our approach dominates in both @xmath0 and @xmath2 forces ; i.e. , the general pattern of the nuclear interaction appears to be more consistent .",
    "the aim of this work is just to study both the new type of three - body forces and the properties of the @xmath2 system with the dressed - bag model ( dbm ) proposed for @xmath0 and @xmath2 forces .",
    "in particular , we will show that the role of 3bf changes remarkably compared to the conventional obe models .",
    "in the conventional models , the main contribution to the @xmath2 binding energy comes from the pair @xmath0 force , whereas 3bf gives a certain ( although significant ) correction of about 15% to the total binding energy .",
    "in contrast , in our dbm approach the contribution of the new scalar three - body forces turns out to be larger by several times and is equal to about half the total @xmath2 binding energy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect.ii",
    ", we give a brief description of the dbm for the @xmath0 system . in sect .",
    "iii , we develop the multi - component formalism for the @xmath2 system . in sect .",
    "iv , the general formalism is specified to the one - pole approximation for the dressed - bag resolvent , which is used in our calculations . in sect .",
    "v , three types of 3bf are considered : one - meson exchange ( @xmath28 and @xmath1 ) between the dressed bag and third nucleon and the @xmath38-exchange with breaking of the @xmath1-loop in the two - nucleon interaction .",
    "the results of our variational calculation of the @xmath2 system are given in sect.vi and the results are discussed in sect.vii . in the conclusion",
    "we summarize the main results of the work .",
    "here , we give a brief description of the two - component dressed - bag model for the @xmath0 interaction . the detailed description has been presented in our previous papers  @xcite .",
    "we consider a system that can exist in two different phase states : the @xmath0 phase and dressed six - quark bag phase . in the @xmath0 channel ,",
    "the system can be described as two nucleons interacting via one - boson exchange ; in the @xmath39 channel , the system is treated as a six - quark bag surrounded by the strong scalar - isoscalar @xmath1-field ( a `` dressed '' bag ) .",
    "interaction at energies @xmath40  gev still requires other fields in the bag such as @xmath34 , @xmath41 and @xmath19 but here we employ the version of dbm including only a leading @xmath1-field  @xcite with parameters which are determined either phenomenologically from fit of @xmath0 phase shifts ( variant ( i ) ) or taken directly from the respective @xmath1-loop diagram ( the variant ( ii ) ) . ] accordingly , the wavefunction of the system consists of two components of different nature : @xmath42 the hamiltonian of the system has the corresponding matrix form @xmath43 here , @xmath44 includes the direct @xmath0 interaction induced by one- and two - pion exchanges with the @xmath15 form factors taken with the correct `` soft '' cut - off parameters  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath44 describes the peripheral part ( at @xmath45  fm ) of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "@xmath46 is the hamiltonian of the dressed bag , while the operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 describe the transitions from @xmath0 to the @xmath49 channel and vice versa .",
    "the schrdinger equation - channel mesons are treated relativistically , while the heavy @xmath33 bag and nucleons are taken in the nonrelativistic approximation .",
    "this is quite reasonable at the energy range @xmath50  gev . ]",
    "reduced to two coupled equations and , by excluding the second component @xmath51 , one obtains the following equation for the proper @xmath0 channel wavefunction with the effective hamiltonian : @xmath52 having obtained the solution of this equation for the @xmath53 component , one can also find straightforwardly the second component @xmath51 : @xmath54    using the following simple one - pole approximation for the dressed bag resolvent @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath33 part of the wavefunction for the dressed bag and @xmath58 represents the plane wave of the @xmath1-meson propagation , one obtains an effective interaction in the nn channel as a sum of separable terms .-",
    "channel @xmath59  gev because the energy spacing @xmath60 between different excited states of the dressed bag ( with different parity and number of radial nodes ) is expected around 300 - 350  mev .",
    "so that the spacings between excited states in the fixed channel ( with the same parity ) should be around @xmath61  mev in the c.m .",
    "hence a few - quantum excitations of the bare @xmath33 bag should lie very high in the spectrum .",
    "] we emphasize that the sign of the dressed bag wavefunction @xmath62 at low and intermediate energies @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 is the lowest eigenenergy of the dressed bag ) is _ opposite _ to that of the @xmath0 wavefunction .    to solve equation ( [ eff1 ] ) in such an approximation ,",
    "the knowledge of total hamiltonian @xmath46 of the dressed bag , as well as the total transition operator @xmath48 , is not necessary .",
    "only the projections of the transition operator @xmath65 onto the bag states @xmath66 are necessary to construct the interaction in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "these projections have been calculated in the microscopic quark - meson model  @xcite .",
    "the effective interaction @xmath67 induced in the @xmath0 channel by coupling with the intermediate dressed bag state is illustrated by the graph in fig .  1 .",
    "in general , the state index @xmath68 includes all quantum numbers of the dressed bag , i.e. @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , @xmath24 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are the orbital angular momentum of the @xmath33 bag , its spin , isospin , total angular momentum , and its projection on the @xmath74 axis , respectively , and @xmath75 is the orbital angular momentum of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "however , in the present version of the dbm , only the s - wave state of the @xmath33 bag with the @xmath26 configuration is taken into account , so that @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and the isospin of the bag is uniquely determined by its spin .",
    "the states of the dressed bag with @xmath78 should lie higher than those with @xmath79 .",
    "for this reason , the former states are not included in the present version of the model . therefore , the state index @xmath68 is specified here by the total angular momentum of the bag @xmath72 and ( if necessary ) its @xmath74 projection @xmath73 : @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the effective interaction in the @xmath0 channel @xmath81 , after partial - wave decomposition , can be written as a sum of separable terms in each partial wave : @xmath82 with @xmath83 the energy - dependent coupling constants @xmath84 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ zlz ] ) are calculated from the diagram shown in fig .  1 ;",
    "i.e. , they are expressed in terms of the loop integral of the product of two transition vertices @xmath85 and the convolution of two propagators for the meson and quark bag with respect to the momentum @xmath86 : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the kinetic energy of the dressed bag : @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the reduced mass in the @xmath39 channel @xmath91 , and @xmath92 being relativistic energy of @xmath1-meson : @xmath93 .",
    "the vertex form factors @xmath94 and the potential form factors @xmath95 have been calculated in the microscopic quark - meson model  @xcite .    when the @xmath0-channel wavefunction @xmath53 is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with the effective hamiltonian @xmath96 , the @xmath97-component of the wavefunction can be found algebraically from eq .",

    "assuming that the nucleonic part of the wavefunction @xmath53 found from the effective schrdinger equation has the standard normalization @xmath107 , one obtains that the weight of the dressed bag component is equal to @xmath108    .deuteron properties in dbm .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the model constructed above gives a very good description for the coupled - channel @xmath111 phase shifts , mixing parameter @xmath112 and singlet @xmath113 shifts in the energy region from zero up to 1 gev  @xcite .",
    "the deuteron observables obtained in this model without any additional parameter are presented in table  1 in comparison with some other @xmath0 models and experimental values .",
    "the quality of agreement with experimental data for the deuteron static properties found with the presented force model , in general , is higher than those for the modern @xmath0 potential model such as bonn , argonne , etc .",
    ", especially for the asymptotic mixing parameter @xmath110 and the deuteron magnetic and quadrupole moments .",
    "the weight of the dressed bag component in the deuteron is calculated from the energy dependence of the coupling constants @xmath114 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ deriv ] ) and ( [ beta2 ] ) and is varied from 2.5% to 3.6% in different versions of the model  @xcite .",
    "when generalizing the above model to the @xmath2 system , one meets two difficulties : the appearance of the energy dependent coupling constants @xmath115 and the presence of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom in _ an explicit form_. thus , we suggest that the @xmath2 system can be found in the five different states ( in three phases ) : @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 . therefore , the total wave function can be represented as the five - row fock column @xmath121    the nucleonic component @xmath122 here describes the system as three nucleons interacting at large distances via ( one- and two- ) boson exchanges . in the @xmath123 channels ,",
    "there are the dressed @xmath33 bag and @xmath124th nucleon ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "hereinafter , the symbol @xmath1 in the notation of these channels is omitted for brevity .",
    "the wavefunction component @xmath126 depends on the dressed bag variables , including the momentum of the @xmath1-meson , and the @xmath127 relative motion variable ( the jacobi coordinate or momentum ) .",
    "the fifth component of the total wavefunction ( [ fock3 ] ) describes a dressed nine - quark bag .",
    "the admixture of the dressed @xmath128-bag in @xmath2 system and in `` normal '' nuclei should be rather low , at least one order of magnitude lower as compared to the weight of the @xmath33 bag .",
    "this can be easily explained by the fact the @xmath128-clusters in nuclei can be only generated from @xmath33 and @xmath129-clusters at their fusion which has rather low probability due to very high kinetic energy of @xmath128 system .",
    "so the weight of @xmath128 configuration must be a small fraction of that for @xmath130 component .",
    "thus one can expect only a very minor effects of this @xmath128 configurations except the region of very high momentum transfer .",
    "therefore , we neglect this component in present study and consider below the 4-component system with the ( 4x4)-matrix hamiltonian @xmath131 here , we use the brief notation for the following parts of the hamiltonian : the operator @xmath132 describes the transition from the @xmath133 channel to the pure three - nucleon channel ; the hamiltonian @xmath134 describes the interacting system of the dressed @xmath33 bag and @xmath124th nucleon .    in our @xmath2 dynamics , we neglect the direct transitions between different @xmath135 channels .",
    "such channels are coupled only via an intermediate @xmath2 configurations .",
    "this assumption looks absolutely natural , while the incorporation of direct transitions between such channels requires some exotic new mechanisms for the coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath136 of the nucleonic channel includes the kinetic energy of the relative motion of three nucleons and the direct @xmath0 interactions ( ope and tpe with soft cut - offs ) that enter into the two - body hamiltonian : @xmath137 hereinafter , we use lowercase letters ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 , etc . ) for two - body operators and capital letters for three - body ones .",
    "the ( @xmath140)-transition operators @xmath141 do not affect the third nucleon and therefore take the form : @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the two - body dbm transition operators for pair ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "since direct transitions between different @xmath97 channels are absent , the exclusion of the @xmath97 components is completely similar to the two - body case : hence one can rewrite the 4-component hamiltonian in the two - component form @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the _ diagonal _ ( 3x3)-matrix operator with the elements @xmath147 .",
    "the resolvent of @xmath146 is also a diagonal ( 3x3)-matrix .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath147 describes the dressed bag @xmath148 ( formed by the fusion of the @xmath149th and @xmath86th nucleons ) interacting as a whole with the third ( @xmath124th ) nucleon via exchanges by mesons ( @xmath28 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "just this interaction results in the new three - body force arising in the two - phase model .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath150 is the direct sum of the dressed - bag hamiltonian @xmath151 and single - particle hamiltonian of the @xmath124th nucleon @xmath152 , which includes its kinetic energy and the potential energy of its interaction with the bag : @xmath153 it depends only on the single jacobi coordinate ( or momentum ) of the third ( @xmath124th ) nucleon .",
    "therefore , the resolvent of @xmath147 is equal to the convolution of two subresolvents : the first for the dressed - bag hamiltonian @xmath154 and the second for the single - particle hamiltonian ( [ h6qn ] ) : @xmath155 where @xmath156    excluding the @xmath97 channels from the schrdinger equation for the total four - component wave function , one arrives at the following effective hamiltonian @xmath157 acting in the @xmath2 channel : @xmath158 which has the form of the standard three - body hamiltonian with pairwise _ energy - dependent _ interactions : @xmath159    this form of the effective hamiltonian is quite suitable for the standard faddeev reduction .",
    "although the effective interaction is the sum of three `` pairwise '' interactions , each term @xmath160 describes not a genuine two - body force but a three - body force including the interaction between the @xmath33 bag and third nucleon .",
    "moreover , even if this interaction is disregarded , the potential @xmath160 still depends on the momentum of the third nucleon .",
    "this dependence on the momentum of the third particle reduces the strength of the effective interaction between two other particles due to a specific energy dependence of the coupling constants .",
    "actually , the form of the effective hamiltonian ( [ h3eff ] ) implies that there are no pure two - body forces in the @xmath2 system in our approach , except the peripheral part of the obe interaction .    after solving the faddeev equations ( or the schrdinger equation for bound states ) with the effective hamiltonian ( [ h3eff ] ) for the @xmath2 wavefunction ,",
    "the `` bag '' components of the total wave function are `` recovered '' by means of the relationship : @xmath161",
    "the momentum representation is more appropriate for description of the @xmath2 system in the case of dbm .",
    "we will employ the same notation for functions both in the coordinate and momentum representations . in the single - pole approximation for the dressed - bag resolvent ,",
    "the resolvent @xmath162 ( [ resi ] ) can be reduced to a sum of factorized terms : @xmath163 and the effective @xmath2 interaction @xmath164 becomes the sum of integral operators with factorized kernels : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is expressed in terms of the integral of the product of the vertex functions and one - particle resolvent ( [ g6qn ] ) : @xmath167 if the interaction between the @xmath33 bag and third nucleon is neglected , the resolvent @xmath168 becomes the simple propagator : @xmath169 then , the effective interaction reduces to the sum of two - body separable potentials with the coupling constants depending on the total three - body energy @xmath170 and third - particle momentum @xmath171 : @xmath172 where the coupling constants @xmath173 are determined by eq.([lamb ] ) with replacing @xmath170 by @xmath174 .",
    "in other words , the effective interaction in the three - body system reduces to a sum of three effective pairwise interactions @xmath67 depending on the _ total three - body energy _ and momentum of the third ( spectator ) particle : @xmath175 it should be noted that this result does not depend on specific choice of interaction model , but is quite general provided that there are not direct transition between different @xmath97 channels and the transition operators take the form ( [ hi3n ] )    when using the effective interaction ( [ 3nqn ] ) , one must also include an additional three - body force due to the meson - exchange interaction between the dressed bag and third nucleon .",

    "it should be noted that the angular part of the function @xmath181 in eq.([ovjl ] ) is not equal to @xmath182 .",
    "this part includes other angular momenta due to coupling between the angular momenta and spins of the dressed bag and third nucleon . the total overlap function ( without isospin part )",
    "can be written , for example , as ( we use here the same letter for notation of both the total wavefunction and its radial part ) : @xmath183 here , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the total angular momentum of the @xmath2 system and its @xmath74 projection , respectively ; @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the orbital and total angular momenta of the third ( @xmath124th ) nucleon , respectively ; @xmath186 is the total angular momentum of the bag ( @xmath187 , because in our case the bag has zero orbital momentum ) ; and @xmath188 is the orbital angular momentum of a nucleon pair ( @xmath144 ) related to the transition vertex @xmath189 . for the total angular momentum @xmath190 ( the ground state of @xmath3h and @xmath3he ) , the orbital angular momentum of the third nucleon @xmath184 ( in the c.m.s . of the entire system ) can take the values @xmath191 ( we mean here the @xmath97 component only ) .",

    "based on eq.([norm1 ] ) , we can attribute the meaning of the wavefunction of the third nucleon in the @xmath97 channel to the quantity    @xmath201    with this `` wavefunction '' , one can calculate the mean value of any operator depending on the momentum ( or coordinate ) of the third nucleon .",
    "we note that the derivative @xmath202 is always _ positive_.",
    "in this work , we employ the effective interaction ( [ kernel0 ] ) and take into account the interaction between the dressed bag and third nucleon as an additional three - body force ( 3bf ) .",
    "we consider here three types of 3bf : one - meson exchange ( @xmath28 and @xmath1 ) between the dressed bag and third nucleon ( see figs.3a and 3b ) and the exchange by two @xmath1-mesons , where the third - nucleon propagator breaks the @xmath1-loop of the two - body force ( fig.3c ) .",
    "+    all these forces can be represented as some integral operators with factorized kernels similar to the effective interaction @xmath164 ( [ kernel ] ) @xmath203    therefore , matrix elements for 3bf include only the overlap functions , and thus the contribution of 3bf is proportional to the weight of the @xmath97 component in the total wavefunction . to our knowledge , the first calculation of the 3bf contribution induced by one - pion exchange between the @xmath33 bag and third nucleon was done by fasano and lee  @xcite in the hybrid quark - compound bag model ( qcb ) using perturbation theory .",
    "they used the model where the weight of the @xmath33 component in a deuteron is ca .",

    "our results for the ope 3bf agree with the results obtained by fasano and lee , because the ope contribution to 3bf is proportional to the weight of the @xmath33 component , and it should be in our case at least twice as large as in their calculation",

    "we emphasize that , due to ( proposed ) restoration of chiral symmetry in our approach , the @xmath1-meson mass is ca .",
    "400  mev , and thus the effective radius of the @xmath1-exchange interaction is not so small as that in conventional obe models .",
    "therefore , we can not use the perturbation theory anymore to estimate the 3bf contribution and have to do the full calculation including 3bf in the total three - body hamiltonian .",
    "for the one - meson exchange ( ome ) term , the three - body interaction @xmath204 takes the form : @xmath205 @xmath206 therefore , the matrix element for one - meson exchange can be expressed in terms of the wave function of the `` bag '' components @xmath126 : @xmath207    including spin - isospin variables ( it is important for evaluation of pion - exchange interaction ) , we can write down @xmath208 as @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the bag isospin , @xmath71 and @xmath211 are the total isospin of the system ( @xmath212 for @xmath3h and @xmath3he ) and its @xmath74-projection respectively and @xmath213 are the overlap functions ( [ ovfull ] ) .    when calculating the matrix elements for ome , one can use a similar trick as in the calculation of the norm for the @xmath97 component .",

    "we employed a rational approximation for the energy dependence of @xmath114  @xcite : @xmath219 where the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath220 are taken to be the same for all @xmath217 s .",
    "we found that this simple rational form can reproduce quite accurately the exact energy dependence of the coupling constants @xmath115 calculated from the loop diagram in fig .  1 .",
    "for an energy dependence such as in eq.([approx ] ) , the energy derivative and @xmath221 have the form @xmath222 @xmath223 thus , the matrix elements for ome can be found without using the vertex functions @xmath224 explicitly .

    "we found that the contribution of ope is so small that it is sufficient to include here only @xmath24 waves . in this case , only the central part of the ope interaction remains : @xmath230 the spin - isospin matrix element is nonzero only for a singlet - triplet transition : @xmath231 then , the matrix element of the ope contribution for @xmath30 waves takes the form @xmath232 here , we take the vertex functions @xmath233 and @xmath234 differing from each other only by a constant . therefore , using eq.([repl ] ) , one can exclude these functions from the formula for the matrix elements .",
    "we did not introduce here any cut - off factor for ope , because the overlap functions truncate the ope interaction at large @xmath235 values .",
    "it should be noted that the overlap functions @xmath236 and @xmath237 for singlet and triplet bags , respectively , are very similar in shape and magnitude but have _ opposite signs _ ( see fig.5 ) .",

    "the two - sigma process shown in fig.4 also contributes significantly to 3bf .",
    "this @xmath2 interaction seems less important than the ose force , because this interaction imposes a specific kinematic restriction on the @xmath2 configuration .- meson .",

    "the operator of this interaction includes the vertex functions for the ( @xmath243 ) and reverse transitions so that these vertices can not be excluded similarly to the case of ome .",

    "the @xmath2 results presented in the previous section differ significantly both from the @xmath2 results found with the conventional models for @xmath0 and @xmath2 forces ( based on yukawa s meson exchange mechanism ) and from the results obtained in the framework of hybrid models  @xcite , which include the two - component representation of the @xmath0 wavefunction @xmath272 .",
    "it is convenient to discuss these differences in the following order .",
    "* we found that the @xmath218 dependence of pair @xmath0 forces on the momentum of the third particle in the @xmath2 system is more pronounced in our case than in other hybrid models  @xcite : the @xmath2 binding energy decreases by more than 1.7  mev , from 5.85 to 4.14 mev ( cf .",
    "the first and second rows in table  2 ) . from the more general point of view , it means that , in our approach , pair @xmath0 interactions ( except yukawa ope and tpe terms ) , being `` embedded '' into a many - body system , loose their two - particle character and become substantially many - body forces ( depending on the momenta of other particles of the system ) . * due to such a strong @xmath218 dependence ( of `` repulsive '' character ) , the @xmath2 system calculated including only pair forces turns out to be strongly underbound ( @xmath273  mev ) .",
    "in other words , the``pairwise '' @xmath0 forces ( including their @xmath218 dependence on the momenta of the third nucleon ) give only about half the total @xmath2 binding energy , leaving the second half for the 3bf contribution .",
    "therefore , the following question is decisively important : can the three - body force ( inevitably arising in our approach ) give the large missing contribution to the @xmath2 binding energy ?",
    "usefulness of the developed model for the description of nuclear systems depends directly on the answer to this important question .",
    "it is appropriate here to remind that in the conventional 3bf models such as urbana - illinois or tucson - melbourne , the contribution of 3bf to the total @xmath2 binding energy does not exceed 1  mev ; i.e. , this contribution can be considered as some correction ( @xmath274% ) , although it is significant for the precise description of the @xmath2 system . *",
    "fortunately , the contribution of 3bf induced by @xmath1 and @xmath38 exchanges enables one to fill this 4.4  mev gap between the two - body force contribution and experimental value .",
    "in fact , including both one- and two - sigma exchange contributions to 3bf , taken with _ the same parameters as in the initial @xmath0-force model _ and a quite reasonable coupling constant @xmath275 , we obtain the @xmath2 binding energy that is very close to the experimental value ( see rows 3,4 and 7,8 in table  2 ) .",
    "thus , the presented force model leads to a very reasonable binding energy for the three - nucleon system but with the strongly enhanced ( as compared to the traditional @xmath2 force model ) contribution of three - body forces . * the contributions of pair and different three - body forces to the total @xmath2 binding energy for @xmath3h",
    "are given in the third and fourth rows of table  2 .",
    "from the results presented in these rows , one can conclude that the total 3bf contribution to the @xmath2 binding energy dominates and , in fact , determines the structure of the @xmath3h ground state to the binding energy decreases noticeably when including 3bf ( due to strengthening the @xmath218 dependence of pair forces ) . ] .",
    "moreover , comparing the third and fourth rows of the table , one can see a `` nonlinear '' effect of self - strengthening for the 3bf contribution .",
    "the comparison of the results presented in the third and fourth rows of the table ( see the second , fourth , and fifth columns ) shows clearly that the binding energy is almost proportional to the weight @xmath271 of the @xmath97 component in the total @xmath2 wavefunction .",
    "thus , when the weight of the @xmath97 component increases , the 3bf contribution , which is related directly only to this component of the total wavefunction , increases accordingly .",
    "however , the enhancement of the pure attractive 3bf contribution squeezes the @xmath2 system and thus reduces its rms radius , i.e. , the mean distance between nucleons , which , in turn , again increases the weight of the @xmath97 component . in other words , a some chain process strengthening",
    "the attraction in the system arises .",
    "this process is balanced both by the weakening of the effective pair interaction due to the @xmath218 dependence and by the repulsive effect of the orthogonalizing pseudopotentials included in each pair interaction .",
    "+ there are two another important stabilizing factors weakening the strong three - body attraction in the @xmath2 system .",
    "first , the generation of the short - range repulsive vector @xmath19-field , where all three nucleons are close to each other  @xcite . since the @xmath19-meson is heavy , this field is located in the deep overlap region of all three nucleons . in this study , we omitted the three - body contribution of this repulsive @xmath19-field . this repulsive contribution will keep the whole system from the further collapse due to the strong attractive @xmath2 force induced by the scalar field .",
    "+ the second factor slightly weakening the effective @xmath2 attraction is associated with the conservation of the number of scalar mesons generated in the @xmath18 and @xmath2 interaction process .",
    "the problem is that @xmath38-exchange giving the 3bf contribution ( see fig .",
    "4 ) arises due to the break of the @xmath1-meson loop , which induces the main @xmath18 force . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath1-meson generated in the transition of pair nucleons from the @xmath0 phase state to the @xmath33 state is absorbed either in the @xmath33 bag with closing the loop or by the third nucleon resulting in the 3bf contribution .",
    "thus , the appearance of such a 3bf should weaken attraction between nucleons in the pair .",
    "we carefully estimated the effect of the meson - number conservation for the tse contribution on the total @xmath2 binding energy .",
    "its magnitude occurred to be rather moderate in the absolute energy scale ( ca .",
    "0.3  0.4  mev ) but quite noticeable within the whole tse contribution .",
    "however , when the total nucleon density increases ( and the relative tse contribution also increases ) , the effect is enhanced . *",
    "dependence of the two - body coupling constants @xmath276 upon the average momentum of other nucleon in three - nucleon system ( see e.g. eq .  ( [ kernel0 ] ) can be interpreted generally as a density dependence of the two - body force in many - nucleon system .",
    "thus , one fixes ( e.g. at energy @xmath277 ) the value of energy dependent coupling constant @xmath278 of our two - body force , i.e. , if one disregards its @xmath218-dependence ( this @xmath218-dependence leads to a weakening of the two body force in a many - nuclear system when @xmath218 is rising ) , than the neglected @xmath218-dependence must be compensated by an additional _ repulsive density - dependent effective three - body force_. + on the other hand , it is well known from the skirme - model calculations of nuclei that just similar repulsive phenomenological density - dependent three - body force should be added to conventional @xmath18- and @xmath2-forces to guarantee the saturation properties of heavy nuclei .",
    "thus , in this respect the present force model is also in a qualitative agreement with phenomenological picture of nuclear interactions . + * figure 5 shows two types of the @xmath3h @xmath30-wave wavefunctions in the @xmath97 channel : the triplet @xmath279 ( solid line ) and singlet @xmath280 ( dashed line ) overlap functions given by eqs.([ovjl ] , [ ovfull ] ) and the corresponding `` quasi - wavefunctions '' @xmath281 and @xmath282 normalized according to eq .",
    "( [ npsi ] ) .",
    "the triplet functions are multiplied by ( -1 ) for convenience .",
    "it is evident that there is an inner node ( at @xmath283  fm ) in all @xmath30-wave components of the quasi - wavefunctions and the overlap functions .",
    "these inner nodes are stationary when the total energy increases and the @xmath284 scattering problem is considered . as is seen in fig .  5",
    ", the overlap function @xmath279 for the triplet @xmath97 channel has a more extended tail than the singlet component @xmath280 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath2 system in the spin - triplet channel ( coinciding with deuteron channel ) is less bound , by about 2  mev , than in the spin - singlet channel .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a formalism for a multi - component description of the three - nucleon system within the new approach to the @xmath18 and @xmath2 interactions based on the dressed dibaryon and @xmath1-field generation .",
    "it has been shown that the dbm applied to the @xmath2 system results automatically in a new three - body scalar force due to the interaction between the dressed dibaryon and third nucleon .",
    "this force plays a crucial role in the structure of few - nucleon systems .",
    "our accurate variational calculations have demonstrated that new 3bf gives half the 3n binding energy , whereas the 3bf contribution in the traditional @xmath0-force approaches gives about 15% of the total binding energy .",
    "thus , the suggested approach to the @xmath0 interaction can lead to significant revision of relative contributions of two- and many - body forces in nuclear systems .",
    "it is crucially important that the dbm gives an 8 - 11% non - nucleonic component in the 3n wavefunction , while this component in the deuteron is equal to only about 3% , leading to a reformulation of many effects in few - nucleon systems and other nuclei as well .",
    "it is probable that the weight of such non - nucleonic components in heavy nuclei can be even higher with an increase in the mass number and nuclear density .",
    "generalization to @xmath5 ( and more ) systems can be done rather similarly to the case of conventional force model .",
    "having @xmath18- and @xmath2-forces fixed from @xmath18- and @xmath2- calculations one can straightforwardly consider systems with larger number of nucleons with these forces to be incorporated , i.e. ignoring the contribution of @xmath5 etc .",
    "however there is still another possibility to proceed for many - body systems .",
    "if the contribution of such many - body forces will occur to be significant one can reformulate the whole scheme in terms of collective @xmath1- ( and other ) fields interacting with relativistic nucleons and dibaryons , i.e. in the spirit of walecka - serot model of hadrodynamics .",
    "the only essential difference in this point from the serot - walecka model is adding dibaryon components to the nucleonic ones .",
    "moreover , our approach , contrary to the conventional obe - approach , leads inevitably to a strong enhancement of collective @xmath1-field in nuclei and thus to validity of walecka - type model .",
    "numerous modern experiments could corroborate these results .",
    "in particular , according to the recent experiments @xmath285@xcite and their theoretical interpretation on the basis of fully realistic @xmath2 calculations , the cross sections for the @xmath285 process can not be explained within a fully realistic @xmath2 model incorporating the process where a proton knocked out by a virtual @xmath286-ray photon is sequentially rescattered by the second nucleon .",
    "these calculations show that the leading contribution comes from the one - step process where a virtual photon is absorbed by one nucleon in the target , while the remaining two nucleons ( which are spectators in this process ) are emitted ( in coincidence ) at the second step .",
    "this important conclusion has been further corroborated in recent experiments at the jefferson laboratory when the incident electron beam energy has been increased up to @xmath287  gev and 4.4  gev  @xcite .",
    "the data of the two different experiments give a clear evidence of very strong short - range @xmath0 correlation in the @xmath3he ground state .",
    "this correlation still can not be explained within the traditional pattern for the @xmath2 system .",
    "in addition , our approach has recently been partially corroborated  @xcite from the other side by considering a model for @xmath34 production in @xmath288 collisions at @xmath289 and 900  mev .",
    "the authors have found that almost all particle energy- and angular correlations ( e.g. @xmath290 and etc . ) can be explained quantitatively by assuming that @xmath291 production occurs through the generation of an intermediate light @xmath1-meson with the mass @xmath292  mev and rather narrow width .",
    "these values generally agree with the parameters adopted in our @xmath0 model  @xcite and drastically disagree with the values assumed in obe and other potential models .",
    "very interesting general implication of the results presented here is their evident interrelation to the famous walecka hadrodynamic model for nuclei  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the walecka model describes nuclei and nuclear matter in terms of the scalar @xmath1 and vector @xmath19-fields , where the @xmath1-field gives the attractive contribution , while the vector @xmath19-field balances this attraction by short - range repulsion .",
    "it is very important that both basic fields exist ( in the model ) as the _ explicit degrees of freedom _ ( together with relativistic nucleons ) in contrast to conventional meson - exchange models for nuclear forces , where mesons appear as the carriers of forces rather than as the _ explicit _ field degrees of freedom .",
    "our approach does include the @xmath1-meson ( and potentially the @xmath19-meson ) degrees of freedom in an explicit form similarly to the walecka model .",
    "moreover , since the average kinetic energy of the @xmath2 system is high in our model ( it is higher than that in the conventional obe approach by a factor of more than 2 ) , nucleon motion is closer to the relativistic case , and thus the similarity with the walecka model is even closer .",
    "these general arguments give an additional strong support for the @xmath18- and @xmath2-force model presented here .",
    "quite independent numerous arguments in favour of this approach in nuclear physics are presented in the subsequent paper  @xcite .",

    "<S> a multi - component formalism is developed to describe three - body systems with nonstatic pairwise interactions and non - nucleonic degrees of freedom . the dressed - bag model for @xmath0 interaction based on the formation of an intermediate six - quark bag dressed by a @xmath1-field </S>",
    "<S> is applied to the @xmath2 system , where it results in a new three - body force between the six - quark bag and a third nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> concise variational calculations of @xmath2 bound states are carried out in the dressed - bag model including the new three - body force . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that this three - body force gives at least half the @xmath2 total binding energy , while the weight of non - nucleonic components in the @xmath3h and @xmath3he wavefunctions can exceed 10% . </S>",
    "<S> the new force model provides a very good description of @xmath2 bound states with a reasonable magnitude of the @xmath4 coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> the model can serve as a natural bridge between dynamical description of few - nucleon systems and the very successful walecka approach to heavy nuclei and nuclear matter . </S>"
