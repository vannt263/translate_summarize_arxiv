    "<S> we argue that in the context of string theory , the usual restriction to globally hyperbolic spacetimes should be considerably relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> we exhibit an example of a spacetime which only satisfies the causal condition , and so is arbitrarily close to admitting closed causal curves , but which has a well - behaved dual description , free of paradoxes .    </S>",

    "<S> although the local light cone is that of special relativity , the global causal properties can be completely different ; spacetimes can have closed timelike curves . </S>",
    "<S> observers in such a spacetime can return to the same point in spacetime , leading to the famous `` grandfather paradox '' .    </S>",
    "<S> time machines have continued to fascinate the science - fiction writer and the student of general relativity alike . </S>",
    "<S> although many solutions with closed timelike curves have been found , it is much more difficult to construct examples where a time machine develops from causally regular initial conditions . in the kerr solution , for example , there is a region of closed timelike curves inside the inner horizon , but this horizon is believed to be unstable due to an infinite blueshift . </S>",
    "<S> this has led to the celebrated chronology protection conjecture  @xcite , which asserts the impossibility of forming a time machine . </S>",
    "<S> this has remained an open question , and a full resolution may require a deeper understanding of quantum gravity . in practical investigations , however ( for example , in numerical relativity , and canonical approaches to quantum gravity ) , attention is commonly restricted to globally hyperbolic spacetimes , which admit a global cauchy surface .    </S>",
    "<S> string theory is a candidate theory of quantum gravity , and it has now been developed to the point where we have a well - studied proposal for a nonperturbative and background independent description of a certain class of spacetimes , via the ads / cft dualities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to ask what this proposal has to say about the question of causality violations . </S>",
    "<S> the first thing to note is that the usual restriction to globally hyperbolic spacetimes must be relaxed , as anti - de sitter space , the paradigmatic example of the duality , is not globally hyperbolic .    </S>",
    "<S> how far do we need to relax ? </S>",
    "<S> a rich hierarchy of causality properties , weaker than global hyperbolicity , has been defined in the past . in order of increasing strength , </S>",
    "<S> the most common conditions are : causal @xmath0 weakly distinguishing @xmath0 ( future and past ) distinguishing @xmath0 strongly causal @xmath0 stably causal @xmath0 globally hyperbolic . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a review , see  @xcite . ) the most natural criterion would be to consider stably causal spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> a spacetime is _ stably causal _ if it remains causal under any sufficiently small deformation of the metric . in a theory of quantum gravity , where the metric is subject to quantum fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> , one would therefore expect that stable causality should constitute the minimal requirement needed to avoid possible pathologies . </S>",
    "<S> also , spacetimes which are causal but not stably causal must , by definition , form a subset of measure zero in the space of continuous metrics , and until recently , few physically interesting examples of such spacetimes were known . in standard texts such as  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , examples of such spacetimes are constructed by the rather unphysical method of excising points from the spacetime manifold .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , anti - de sitter space is stably causal . </S>",
    "<S> the failure of global hyperbolicity is a result of the asymptotic behaviour : it has a timelike conformal boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this is important , as it implies that once we specify appropriate boundary conditions on this conformal boundary , the spacetime will have a well - defined initial value problem , defining ` cauchy ' evolution from an initial slice . </S>",
    "<S> there is a cauchy horizon associated with each cauchy surface in this spacetime , but unlike in the example of the kerr spacetime , it is not a surface of infinite blueshift . </S>",
    "<S> hence there is no natural mechanism to render the physical part of the spacetime globally hyperbolic . </S>",
    "<S> the failure of global hyperbolicity is thereby closely tied to the dual cft , whose definition is linked to the asymptotic boundary conditions in spacetime .    another interesting class of backgrounds which are stably causal but not globally hyperbolic are plane waves . </S>",
    "<S> the story is similar for these solutions . </S>",
    "<S> it was observed by penrose  @xcite that they are not globally hyperbolic spacetimes , and more recently , they were shown to be stably causal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the failure of global hyperbolicity is again associated with the asymptotic behaviour of the spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> a family of plane wave spacetimes has been shown to have a one - dimensional null boundary  @xcite , which is both to the past and future of points in the interior of the spacetime . given boundary conditions on this conformal boundary , a well - defined initial data problem should exist . </S>",
    "<S> certain plane waves have also been related to dual field theory descriptions through the bmn correspondence  @xcite , which is obtained by considering the plane wave that arises in the penrose limit of an asymptotically ads spacetime .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous two examples suggest a picture where we relax the condition of global hyperbolicity only slightly , considering stably causal spacetimes which , once we specify appropriate asymptotic boundary conditions , still have a well - defined initial value problem .    </S>",
    "<S> however , we now wish to argue that we actually need to relax it much more radically , and extend our criterion to include causal spacetimes which are not even distinguishing . </S>",
    "<S> ( a spacetime is _ causal _ if it does not contain any closed causal curves , and it is _ distinguishing _ if distinct points have distinct causal past and future sets . )    the first evidence that we should allow ourselves to consider spacetimes with such weak causal properties comes from the recent construction of simple uncontrived examples . </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out in  @xcite that for pp - waves , whose metric can be written as @xmath1 if the function @xmath2 grows faster than quadratically in @xmath3 for some @xmath3 , the spacetime is actually _ not _ stably causal ; in fact , it is not even distinguishing ! indeed , such pp - waves are rather spectacularly non - distinguishing , as _ all _ spacetime points with the same @xmath4 coordinate ( say @xmath5 ) have the same past and future , consisting of all points with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . in  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was shown that some examples , where the function @xmath2 grew exponentially at large @xmath3 for some @xmath3 , could be described in string theory , via a world - sheet conformal field theory with no obvious pathologies .     in the spacetime , it is possible to reach point @xmath8 by a usual causal curve . to reach point @xmath9 ( which is `` close '' to @xmath10 ) we need to go out towards the asymptotic region and then loop back . </S>",
    "<S> such a curve is drawn above along with its projection onto a constant @xmath11 plane . by going out further in @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> we can engineer curves to return arbitrarily close to our starting point . </S>",
    "<S> existence of these causal curves implies that the causal future of @xmath13 is the part of the spacetime above the plane of constant @xmath4 drawn in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> contrast this with the flat space light cone of the point . </S>",
    "<S> , width=528 ]    however , lacking a full non - perturbative description , one might still question whether such spacetimes can be physically relevant , as they are arbitrarily close to developing closed timelike curves . a new example , which is related to a field theory description via an ads / cft type duality , provides strong evidence that in fact they are physically relevant . </S>",
    "<S> the metric may be written as @xmath14 the second line , included to explicitly demonstrate the spacetime being conformal to a pp - wave , is obtained by @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behaviour of the metric as @xmath16 is responsible for its non - distinguishingness . </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath17 the metric is that of @xmath18 in poincar coordinates . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nondistlc ] we illustrate some causal properties of the spacetime .    </S>",
    "<S> this geometry can be obtained by a solution generating transformation from the anti - de sitter spacetime involved in the ads / cft correspondence ( for details , see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can consider the action of this transformation in the field theory variables , to show that this geometry is also related to a field theory  living on the boundary \"  in the present case the dual is a  field theory . </S>",
    "<S> this is a non - local theory , but it nevertheless obeys all the usual properties of a quantum field theory and hence serves as a non - perturbative description of quantum gravity in the background . </S>",
    "<S> we take the view that any spacetime which is dual to a well - defined quantum field theory must itself be sensible ( physically relevant ) . </S>",
    "<S> the field theory description guarantees that the causal pathologies can not lead to paradoxes . </S>",
    "<S> one can in fact show that the non - distinguishing nature of the spacetime is a necessary consequence of the non - local interactions of the  field theory ; the micro - causality conditions in the field theory force this unusual causal behaviour on the dual spacetime !    </S>",
    "<S> note that in , the violation of stronger causality conditions comes again from the asymptotic region of spacetime , at @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> since the relation to the field theory fixes the asymptotic boundary conditions , the metric should not be thought of as freely fluctuating in this @xmath16 region . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it will not suffer from any problems associated with closed timelike curves , even though the field theory really corresponds to treating the metric quantum mechanically . </S>",
    "<S> ( as a result , we do not regard this example as evidence that we should consider spacetimes with closed timelike curves as physical . )    thus , in the ads / cft context , we are driven to relax the causality requirement as far as possible : not only is global hyperbolicity too stringent a requirement , but even the weak distinguishing property appears to be too constraining ! there exist spacetimes which are arbitrarily close to admitting closed causal curves but which are still dual to sensible quantum field theories , free of paradoxes . we therefore conclude that spacetimes wherein the asymptotic behaviour leads to violations of the stronger causality conditions may play an important role . </S>"
