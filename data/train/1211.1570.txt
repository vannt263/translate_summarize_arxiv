    "fluctuation in the initial condition for hydrodynamic study of heavy - ion collisions have been found necessary for the description of the anisotropic flow of final hadrons .",

    "the number of excited strings in each event is equal to participant nucleons .",
    "the number of mini - jets per binary nucleon - nucleon collisions follows a poisson distribution with the average value given by mini - jet cross section , which depends on the colliding energy and the impact parameter through an impact - parameter dependent parton shadowing @xcite in a nucleus . hijing uses the glauber model to determine the number of participants and binary nucleon - nucleon collisions with the wood - saxon nuclear distribution .",
    "both soft partons from string melting and mini - jet partons will take part in parton cascade for a short period . in this model",
    ", the total local energy - momentum density of partons and its fluctuations will be determined by the number of participants , binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , number of mini - jets per nucleon - nucleon collision , the fragmentation of excited strings , and the parton cascading .",

    "note that the bjorken scaling assumption @xmath12 is not used here because of early parton cascade before the initial time and the uncertainty principle applied to the initial formation time in ampt .",
    "we used @xmath13 and @xmath14 fm in au+au collisions at @xmath15 gev in the following calculations which gives good description of the multiplicity density of produced hadrons at central rapidity .",
    "to investigate the effect of longitudinal fluctuations on hadron spectra and elliptic flow , we compare the ( 3 + 1)d hydrodynamic calculations using the full ampt initial conditions with that using a tube - like smooth initial longitudinal distribution . in the event - by - event tube - like initial condition",

    "the length of the plateau @xmath18 in the center rapidity region and the width of the gaussian fall - off @xmath19 at large rapidity are adjusted to fit the multiplicity distribution of charged hadrons . in another comparison",
    ", we also calculate the hadron spectra and elliptic flow for one shot tube initial condition , which is averaged over many ampt initial conditions but rotated by an angle in each event to a common participant plane .",

    "the yield of high @xmath16 particles from event - by - event tube initial conditions on the other hand is increased due to the fluctuations ( both in energy density and flow velocity ) in the transverse direction as compared to the spectra from one - shot - tube initial conditions .",
    "similar results were found in ( 2 + 1)d @xcite and ( 3 + 1)d @xcite hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "this can be understood as the fast isotropic expansion of each hot spot in the transverse direction at the the early time of the hadrodynamic evolution .",
    "fluctuations in the longitudinal direction in the full ampt initial conditions also lead to hot spots in the longitudinal direction .",

    "we showed that fluctuations in rapidity direction reduce noticeably the elliptic flow at large transverse momentum , which brings more constraint on extracting @xmath33 from comparison between the experimental data with viscous hydrodynamic calculations .",
