    "dense , neutral ( @xcite ; @xcite ) knots with ionized cometary tails are found in the central regions of planetary nebulae ( pne ) ; the most famous being those in the helix nebula for , at a distance of only 213 @xmath030/@xmath116 pc @xcite , they were easily detected and resolved by early ground ",
    "based observations ( baade and reported by @xcite ) .",
    "the incredibly clumpy nature of the neutral material in the disk of the helix nebula ( when modelled as a bi  polar pne viewed along its axis , @xcite ; @xcite ) has now been revealed in spectacular fashion in the imagery in the h@xmath2 emission line by @xcite . previously , @xcite had estimated that there were 23,000 cometary knots and that inevitably tail interactions must be occurring .",
    "@xcite show conclusively that it is an inner region in the helix disk , towards the central star , where tails are observed from neutral globules surrounded by an outer clumpy region free of such tails .",
    "@xcite reviewed the two broad models for the creation of the cometary tails ; either they are shadowed from the ionizing radiation of the central star , and their surfaces photo - ionized by scattered lyman photons in the nebula , or they are dynamically produced as the particle winds from the central star swept past the slowly expanding system of dense globules .",
    "a critical distinction between these models arises if the cometary tails can be seen to be flowing along their lengths away from their parent globules .",
    "only the ` dynamic ' model would have this effect .",
    "in fact , a numerical simulation of the flow of a moderately supersonic particle wind past the ionized head of a globule @xcite predicted not only the creation of a cometary tail but a moderate acceleration of ionized material parallel to the tail surface and away from the globule . in this initial model",
    "the neutral material away from the globule had a smooth density distribution .",
    "the most comprehensive optical study of the kinematics of the helix system of globules remains that described in @xcite . here ,",
    "spatially resolved [ n  ii ]  6584    profiles , from 300 separate long - slit ( 163  long ) positions , were obtained with the manchester echelle spectrometer ( mes  @xcite but now with a ccd as the detector ) on the anglo ",
    "australian telescope in exceptional ` seeing ' conditions , over three separate ` blocks ' of globules and their tails in the nebular core .",
    "furthermore , a kinematical ` case study ' of the globule which is apparently the 2nd closest to the nebular core ( knot 14 ) , and a length of its tail , was carried out in a range of emission lines .",
    "the principal outcome was to show that the system of central globules is concentrated in a disk expanding itself at 14 .",
    "flows parallel to the surfaces of the cometary tails of two of the most prominent globules ( knots 38 and 14 ) were also detected and even an acceleration of this flow along the length of the longest tail ( from knot 38 ) suggested .",
    "@xcite challenged these latter assertions without making any further kinematical observations but simply because they claim that more recent hst images reveal confusing minor globules in the longest tail ( knot 38 ) . with the dismissal of these kinematical effects they proceeded to support the shadowing theories of the creation of the tails .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to reassess the strength of the deductions from the @xcite kinematical data set in the light of the subsequent hst and very latest h@xmath2 imagery by @xcite . in particular , to consider if the evidence in @xcite for flows along the tail surfaces of knots 38 and 14 , away from the central star , is now invalidated by this hst imagery alone as suggested by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the flow behind knot 32 , which was not considered hitherto , is now presented to strengthen the original suggestion that accelerating flows in the cometary tails could be ubiquitous though in a clumpy medium .",
    "knot 38 has the longest ( 62 ) cometary tail and is the apparently closest knot to the central star of ngc 7293 , while knot 14 is the next closest .",
    "the heads of both have arcs of [ o  iii ]  5007    emission facing this star which indicates that they protrude into the hard radiation field of the central volume of the bi  polar , ellipsoidally  shaped , nebula that produces the characteristic helical appearance in emission lines of lower ionization species ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the hst archival images ( pi name : meixner , pid:9700 ) of knots 38 ( hst acs / wfc j8kr14040 ) and 14 ( hst acs / wfc j8kr0840 ) are presented respectively in figs .",
    "1a and 2 . these should be compared with those taken with the new technology telescope ( nnt - chile ) and presented in meaburn et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "all are in the light of the h@xmath3  plus [ n  ii ]  6548  &  6584    nebular emission lines .    the uniquely long ionized tail of knot 38 in fig . 1 is prominent in both the hst and former @xcite ntt images and appears to be a coherent structure in both i.e. it is not simply a consequence of chance superposition of a large number of fore or background tails along the same sightlines .",
    "minor ionized knots appear along the tail in the image in fig . 1a but it is the h@xmath2 2.12@xmath4 m image @xcite shown in fig . 1b that emphasises that the tail of ionized gas , being so long , is formed around an internal core composed of a large number of minor clumps of neutral material",
    ".    with this as a starting point the kinematics along this tail should be re  considered by examining the [ n  ii ]  6584    line profiles presented in @xcite .",
    "the centroids of these profiles are shown in fig .",
    "13 of that paper to change along the 62  length of this tail by a radial velocity difference ( from central knot to tail end ) by 10 .",
    "the velocity images in figs . 4 and 12 of the same paper confirm this systematic radial velocity change in a different way .",
    "unfortunately , the four images in different heliocentric radial velocity ( ) ranges became jumbled in the production of fig .",
    "12 in the @xcite paper",
    ". these should be  @xmath531 to @xmath127 ( top right ) , @xmath125 to @xmath121 ( top left ) , @xmath120 to @xmath115 ( bottom right ) and @xmath114 to @xmath110 ( bottom left ) and all .",
    "when these four images are considered with this correction it is clear that the head of knot 38 appears alone in the top right frame then progressively the tail appears in the subsequent three frames towards more positive velocities as the image of the head declines .",
    "the acceleration along the tail length , if regarded as a coherent feature starting at knot 38 , is very clear and not dominated by the minor confusing knots apparent in fig .",
    "1a . those areas free of these along the tail length of knot 38 in fig .",
    "1 clearly show this radial velocity change .",
    "the appearance of the neutral material in the tail of knot 38 and seen in fig .",
    "1b suggests that the ionized outflow is in a sheath around a clumpy neutral core .",
    "similarly , the [ n  ii ]  6584    line profiles up to 5  from the head of knot 14 ( fig . 9 of @xcite ) show a systematic change of radial velocity of their centroids of -6 .",
    "this was not covered by the h@xmath2 imagery of @xcite .",
    "the tail from knot 14 was modelled kinematically as a flow parallel to the globule and tail surfaces .",
    "the hst images in fig . 2 show that there are no significant minor ionized knots along this small length of the tail .",
    "again an accelerating flow away from the central star is indicated",
    ". if tilted at 25  to the plane of the sky this change of outflow velocity amounts to 14  compared to the apex of the head of the cometary knot .",
    "as shown in figs .",
    "1a & b knot 32 has a more complex structure than that of both knots 38 and 14 .",
    "again , a faint tail of diffuse ionized gas can be seen extending radially away from the central star though the central knot is composed of several neutral clumps .",
    "this tail of course could be an unrelated feature along the same sightline but its appearance suggests that this is unlikely .",
    "the kinematics of the knot 32 tail have now been examined using the set of profiles of the [ n  ii ]  6584    emission line from 100 longslit positions .",
    "these have an ew orientation and each is separated from its neighbour by 1 .",
    "the slit width is @xmath6 6  and 0.5  on the sky .",
    "these observations and their analysis are described fully in @xcite and the reader is referred there for detailed information .    however , the [ n  ii ]  6584    line profile from the very apex of this knot , facing the ionizing star , is shown in fig .",
    "3a and that of the knot head ( 1.5  further from this star ) in fig .",
    "the [ n  ii ]  6584  profiles from the faint material of the knot tail ( 14  and 16  away from the apex ) are shown in figs .",
    "3c & d respectively .",
    "the positions where these line profiles were obtained are marked a  d in the velocity image in fig .",
    "the [ n  ii ]  6584    profiles from the host nebula have been subtracted in each case leaving only the profiles of the [ n  ii ]  6584    emission from knot 32 and its tail in those shown in fig .",
    "this type of ` velocity imagery ' is inevitably blurred in the ns dimension for the adjacent longslit spectra , each orientated ew , that are used to generate individual velocity images are separated by 1  which is then convolved in the imagery with the angular slit width and the 0.8  seeing disk .",
    "a distinct positive shift of around 8 in radial velocity can be seen to be occurring between the apex of the knot and the material in the extended tail .",
    "the ` velocity ' images from the same data set in figs .",
    "c show this radial velocity shift in a different way .",
    "the head of the knot alone appears in fig .",
    "4a (  @xmath531 to @xmath127 ) , the nearest part of the tail in fig .",
    "4b (  @xmath524 to @xmath121 ) and the furthest extent of this tail in fig .",
    "4c (  @xmath520 to @xmath116 ) all of which is consistent with the profiles shown in fig .",
    "the 62  long tail from knot 38 appears to be a coherent structure in the hst , ntt and the previous velocity imagery but formed around an extremely clumpy neutral medium as shown by the h@xmath2 imagery .",
    "the evidence that there are accelerating flows along the walls of the tails of the two most prominent cometary globules in ngc 7293 ( knots 38 and 14 ) , away from the central star , is not substantially affected by the higher resolution hst images or even the extremely clumpy nature of the neutral material revealed in the h@xmath2 imagery .    a similar flow away from the more complex knot 32",
    "is shown to be occurring for the first time in the present paper .",
    "it is valid to attempt to explain flows along the cometary tails in the dynamical type of model in @xcite but now modified to accommodate a very clumpy ambient medium similar to that in @xcite which had been derived for more general clumpy phenomena",
    ".    it is becoming very clear @xcite that the agb particle wind overflowing the clumpy neutral structure of the disk of ngc 7293 , at mildly supersonic velocity , can create and accelerate the cometary tails .",
    "previously , @xcite had shown that an inner quasi ",
    "spherical volume of material shielded the system of cometary knots from exposure to any subsequent fast stellar particle wind .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for constructive comments that have improved the paper considerably .",
    "we also thank m. matsuura who kindly provided their molecular hydrogen image of helix in fits format .",
