    "one of the key inputs used in constructing models of stars , including the sun , is the heavy element abundance , @xmath0 , or the ratio of the abundance of heavy elements to that of hydrogen @xmath1 .",
    "helioseismic studies of solar models constructed with the grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ; henceforth gs ) abundance , and the even earlier grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) abundances , show a remarkable agreement with the sun ( e.g. , christensen - dalsgaard et al . 1996 ; bahcall et al . 1997 ; morel et al . 1999 ; basu , pinsonneault & bahcall 2000 , etc . ) .",
    "the situation has changed in the recent years with the claim by asplund et al ( 2001 ) , allende prieto , lambert & asplund ( 2001 , 2002 ) , asplund ( 2004 ) , asplund et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , asplund et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , that the oxygen , carbon and nitrogen abundance in the sun needs to be reduced .",
    "the reduction in the oxugen abundance implies the reduction of the abundances of other elements such as ne , ar also .",
    "this reduces the solar heavy element abundance from the gs value of @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "asplund , grevesse & sauval ( 2005 ; henceforth ags ) presented a new table of abundances based on the above reduction .",
    "in addition , based on asplund ( 2000 ) they reduced the silicon abundance ( and thus lowered the abundance of all the meteoritic elements ) , and this reduced @xmath1 further to @xmath4 .",
    "solar models constructed with the new , low abundances do not satisfy the helioseismic constraints of the position of the convection - zone base and the helium abundance in the convection zone .",
    "models with the lower heavy - element abundances are found to have too shallow a convection zone ( henceforth cz ) , and a helium abundance , @xmath5 , that is too low .",
    "furthermore , the sound - speed and density profiles of the models do not match those of the sun either ( bahcall & pinsonneault 2004 ; basu & antia 2004 ; bahcall et al .",
    "2005a , 2005b , 2005c , 2006 ; delahaye & pinsonneault 2006 ) .",
    "by looking at the structures of the main heavy - element ionization zones in the solar convection zone antia & basu ( 2006 ) argue that the solar heavy element abundance has to be high , i.e. , close to the old gs values .",
    "pinsonneault & delahaye ( 2006 ) by considering the physics of stellar atmospheres also conclude that high cno abundances are favored .",
    "almost all the helioseismic tests of solar models constructed with the new abundances have focused on the solar convection zone .",
    "few studies have looked at what happens to the solar core . where the core has been considered it has been through results of inversions , where inversion data on the core have been combined with results pertaining to the other parts of the sun to give rms deviations of the sound - speed and density profiles of the models with respect to those of the sun ( e.g. , bahcall et al . 2005a , 2006 ) . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on the solar core .",
    "the solar core is , of course , where all the nuclear reactions take place , and where all the energy and neutrinos are released  hence the interest in what happens to the core when solar metallicity is reduced",
    ".    only modes of low degree ( @xmath6 - 3 ) can be used to determine the structure of the solar core . in this paper",
    "we report a study in which observed low - degree frequencies have been compared with those of several standard solar models constructed with different abundances .",
    "the solar @xmath7-mode data come from observations made by the ground - based birmingham solar - oscillations network ( bison ; chaplin et al .",
    "the bison instruments make disc - averaged observations of the sun in doppler velocity .",
    "these observations have provided the field of helioseismology with high - quality , long - term monitoring of the low-@xmath8 modes . here",
    ", we use frequencies determined to excellent precision from a bison timeseries lasting 13 years .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare and contrast the frequencies of different solar models with those of the sun in order to determine whether we can distinguish between models made with the older , higher abundances on the one hand and those made with the newer ( ags ) abundances on the other .",
    "our aim is then to see if we can rule out one set of abundances , thereby reducing the uncertainty in the solar abundances .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the study of solar neutrinos .",
    "recently the theoretical uncertainty on solar neutrinos had been raised because of the uncertainty in the solar abundances ( bahcall & serenelli 2005 , bahcall et al .",
    "the uncertainties in the values of the heavy - element abundances of the sun are the largest source of the theoretical uncertainty in calculating the @xmath7-@xmath7 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 solar neutrino fluxes ( bahcall & serenelli 2005 ) .",
    "the difference between the gs and ags abundances is larger than the error - bars on each of the abundances , and hence bahcall & serenelli ( 2005 ) and bahcall et al .",
    "( 2006 ) calculated the uncertainties in the neutrino fluxes by designating the difference between gs and ags values as the uncertainty in the composition . in this work",
    "we try to examine if data on the low - degree modes are of sufficient quality to distinguish between models with the older , higher abundances and those with the newer , lower abundances and hence to thereby reduce the neutrino uncertainties to pre - ags levels .",
    "a simple comparison of the frequencies of the sun and solar models is often not very informative .",
    "one reason is that all the modes sample the outer layers of the sun , and hence even low - degree modes do not have localized information on the solar core .",
    "another reason is that the physics used in the solar models does not reproduce the structure of the near - surface layers very well : the main culprit is the very basic treatment of convection , generally using the mixing length theory , which breaks down close to the surface , another factor is that the assumption of adiabaticity , used in the calculation of the frequencies of solar models , breaks down near the solar surface .",
    "both these errors , and other uncertainties relating to the solar surface , give rise to frequency errors that are functions of frequency alone ( e.g. , cox & kidman 1984 ; balmforth 1992 and discussion in christensen - dalsgaard 2002 ) .",
    "to study the core one therefore , normally compares the so - called _ fine _ or _ small frequency spacings _ of the low-@xmath8 @xmath7 modes given by the combination . @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the frequency of a mode of degree @xmath8 and radial order @xmath16 .",
    "the frequencies @xmath17 and @xmath18 are very similar and hence are affected in a similar way by near - surface effects . by taking this difference in frequency a large part of the effects from the near - surface uncertainties thus cancels out .    the fine spacings are determined predominantly by the sound - speed gradient in the core . using the asymptotic theory of @xmath7-modes",
    "it can be shown that ( see e.g. , christensen - dalsgaard & berthomieu 1991 ) @xmath19 where , @xmath20 is the solar radius , and @xmath21 is the large frequency spacing given by @xmath22 which depends inversely on the sound - travel time between the centre and the surface of the sun . given that the gradient of the sound - speed is large in the core , and @xmath23 there is small , the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : smallsep ] is dominated by conditions in the core , and hence the fine spacings are a useful tool to study conditions in the solar core .",
    "although the difference between the frequencies of two modes that have very similar frequencies does reduce the effect of near - surface uncertainties , there are some residual effects .",
    "one way of reducing the effects of the near - surface errors is to use the so - called _ frequency separation ratios_. the frequency separation ratios ( roxburgh & vorontsov 2003 ; ot floranes , christensen - dalsgaard & thompson 2005 ; roxburgh 2005 ) are formed from the fine ( small ) frequency spacings and large frequency spacings of the modes .",
    "the ratios are constructed according to : @xmath24 since both the small and large spacings are affected in the same manner by near - surface effects , these ratios are somewhat independent of the structure of the surface .    in this paper",
    "we use data from bison to form observational estimates of the fine spacings , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the separation ratios , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the observed spacings and ratios have then been compared with estimates formed from a number of different solar models .",
    "bison data on the fine spacings have been used in several previous studies ( e.g. , elsworth et al .",
    "1990 ; chaplin et al .",
    "1997 ) , but those here come from much longer observations and have far superior precision .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the observed data are described in   [ sec : data ] , the solar models are described in   [ sec : models ] , we present and explain our results in   [ sec : res ] , and we discuss the implications of these results to solar neutrino predictions in   [ sec : neut ] , and we present our conclusions in   [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "we have used doppler velocity observations made by the bison over the 4752-d period beginning 1992 december 31 , and ending 2006 january 3 .",
    "mode peaks in the power spectrum of the complete time series were fitted in the usual manner ( e.g. , see chaplin et al .",
    "1999 ) to yield estimates of the low-@xmath8 frequencies .",
    "the bison observations are examples of the so - called _ sun - as - a - star _ data : averages over the visible disc of the perturbations  here , in doppler velocity  associated with the modes .",
    "chaplin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that fine spacings and separation ratios made from the sun - as - a - star data are sensitive to the changing surface activity along the solar cycle . in short ,",
    "the acoustic asphericity leaves its imprint on the azimuthally dependent sun - as - a - star frequencies .",
    "some of the mode components are effectively missing from the data because the sensitivity of the observations to them is so low .",
    "this is a consequence of the visibility of any given @xmath29 being a strong function of the angle of inclination , @xmath30 , offered by the star .",
    "extant sun - as - a - star observations , such as those of the bison , are made from @xmath31 degrees .",
    "this means that only components with @xmath32 even have non - negligible visibility . as such",
    ", it is not possible to estimate directly the frequency centroid ; and estimates of the ` frequency ' of a mode will be influenced strongly by the @xmath33 modes , which are most prominent in the data .",
    "the sun - as - a - star fine spacings are therefore formed from modes with different combinations of @xmath8 and @xmath29 , which may suffer different sized frequency shifts through the solar cycle .    for the @xmath25 data , estimates of the @xmath34 frequencies are dominated by the @xmath35 modes .",
    "they show significantly larger cycle shifts than the lone components of the nearby @xmath6 modes ( e.g. , see chaplin et al .",
    "2004a ; jimnez - reyes et al .",
    "the @xmath25 therefore decrease in size as levels of surface activity increase .",
    "differences between the @xmath36 and 1 components of , respectively , the @xmath37 and 1 modes , are less pronounced , and so cycle shifts arising in the @xmath26 are smaller , at fixed frequency , than in their @xmath25 counterparts .",
    "the separation ratios show a similar behavior . for these data , changes in the large spacing , @xmath21 , which lies in the denominator of equation  [ eq : rats ] , are negligible .",
    "this is because @xmath21 is formed from the difference of two frequency estimates in modes with the same combination of @xmath8 and @xmath29 .",
    "while it is true that there is a dependence of the mode shifts on frequency , the separation of the overtones used to form the @xmath21 is sufficiently small that the impact of this dependence is modest .",
    "changes to the separation ratios are therefore dominated by changes to the fine spacings .",
    "this means that fractional changes in the @xmath27 are , to first order , the same as those in the @xmath25 [ and likewise for the @xmath28 and @xmath26 ] .",
    "prior to calculation of the fine spacings and separation ratios , we therefore removed the solar - cycle shifts from the raw fitted low-@xmath8 frequencies .",
    "our procedure rests on the assumption that variations in certain global solar activity indices can be used as a proxy for the low-@xmath8 frequency shifts , @xmath39 .",
    "we assume the correction can be parameterized as a linear function of the chosen activity measure , @xmath40 .",
    "when the 10.7-cm radio flux ( tapping & de  tracey 1990 ) is chosen as the proxy , this assumption is found to be robust ( e.g. , chaplin et al .",
    "2004a ) at the level of precision of the data .",
    "consider then the set of measured eigenfrequencies , @xmath41 , that we wish to correct , extracted from data collected over the @xmath42 epoch when the mean level of the 10.7-cm radio flux was @xmath43 .",
    "we make the correction to the canonical quiet - sun level of the radio flux , @xmath44 , which , from historical observations of the index , is usually fixed at @xmath45 ( see tapping & detracey 1990 ) . the magnitude of the solar - cycle correction  which must be subtracted from the raw frequencies  will then be : @xmath46                      \\cdot [ \\left <",

    "\\label{eq : corr}\\ ] ] the @xmath47 are @xmath8-dependent factors that calibrate the size of the shift : recall from section  [ sec : cyc ] above that the sun - as - a - star shifts alter significantly with @xmath8 . owing to the nature of the sun - as - a - star data , the change with @xmath8 comes from the spatial dependence of the surface activity . to determine the @xmath48",
    ", we divided the 4752-day timeseries into 44 independent 108-day segments .",
    "the resulting ensemble was then analyzed , in the manner described by chaplin et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , to uncover the dependence of the solar - cycle frequency shifts on the 10.7-cm radio flux .",
    "the @xmath49 $ ] in equation  [ eq : corr ] is a function that allows for the dependence of the shift on mode frequency .",
    "here , we used the determination of @xmath50 $ ] to be found in chaplin et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) .",
    "uncertainty in the correction is dominated by the errors on the @xmath48 .",
    "these errors must be propagated , together with the formal uncertainties from the mode fitting procedure , to give uncertainties on the corrected frequencies , @xmath51 .",
    "the corrected uncertainties are , on average , about 10% larger than those in the raw , fitted frequencies .",
    "after application of the correction procedure , fine spacings and separation ratios were calculated according to equations  [ eq : fine ] and  [ eq : rats ] respectively .",
    "uncertainties on the corrected frequencies were propagated accordingly to give those in the spacings and ratios .",
    "[ fig : dcorr ] shows the differences between fine spacings made with and without the correction ( in the sense corrected spacings minus raw spacings ) .",
    "the ratio data give similar - looking plots . as indicated previously , it is the @xmath25 ( and by implication the @xmath27 ) that are most affected by the correction procedure .",

    "[ fig : dres ] and [ fig : srres ] , and the data in the two tables , it is apparent immediately that the models that show the poorest correspondence with the observations are those that have lowered abundances , i.e. , models bp04 + , bp05(ags , op ) and s06+(ags , op ) .",
    "model bp04 + has slightly higher metallicity than models bp05(ags , op ) and s06+(ags , op ) , and so fares slightly better in the comparisons .",

    "model sac does not fare as well as models jcds or bp04 , however , it still agrees better than do the models with lower abundances .",

    "we shall not discuss models jcds and sac further , except to note again that they fare much better than the low-@xmath1 models .",
    "models jcds and sac were constructed using the older opal equation of state , which did not treat relativistic effects at temperatures and densities relevant to the solar core .",
    "this resulted in a somewhat deficient core structure ( see elliot & kosovichev , 1998 ) .",
    "we shall discuss in more detail below results obtained from models that were instead constructed with the _ corrected _ opal equation of state .",
    "model s06+(ags , op ) was made because a localized change in opacities can resolve the problem of the convection zone depth in models with ags abundances ( see , e.g. basu & antia 2004 ; bahcall et al .",
    "however , it is very clear from the fine spacings , and separation ratios that this model fails in the core .",
    "we find that the model bbs05 - 3 does reasonably .",
    "this model was constructed by increasing the amount of neon compared to the ags abundances , in addition to increasing the quantities of some of the other elements . a strategy of increasing the amounts of neon and other elements ( within their error bars )",
    "was suggested by antia & basu ( 2005 ) and bahcall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) as a potential way to solve the disagreement between the helioseismic observations and the models with ags abundances .",
    "neon contributes to the opacity near the convection - zone base .",
    "an increase in the neon abundance therefore deepens the convection zone , bringing the models into agreement with the helioseismically determined convection - zone depth .",
    "it is worth adding that because of the abundance increases in some of the elements this model has a relatively high @xmath1 ( 0.02069 ) .",
    "differences between the results of the various models ultimately have to be understood in terms of the sound - speed gradient in the core which , _ as per _ eq .",
    "[ eq : smallsep ] , determines the fine spacings and therefore also the separation ratios .",
    "sound speed is determined both by temperature @xmath77 and mean molecular weight @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "the gradient of sound speed is therefore determined by the gradients of temperature and @xmath78 as well .",
    "although the sound - speed gradient is negative in the bulk of the sun , it is positive at very small radii because of the different radial dependences of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , with the increase in @xmath78 at smaller @xmath23 compensating the increasing @xmath77 to give a lower @xmath80 .",
    "we can use the three yrec models to determine why the other models with lower metallicity fare worse than models with higher metallicity in comparison with the bison data .",
    "[ fig : zdiff ] shows the fine spacings and separation ratios of the yrec models , together with the bison data ( points with error bars ) .",
    "we can see that increasing the surface @xmath1 decreases the fine spacings and separation ratios . to explain these results we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : cgrad ] the sound - speed gradient and the mean molecular weight profiles of the yrec models .",
    "it is clear that differences between the models lie very close to the center , where @xmath81 is positive .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the structure of the yrec models shows that the @xmath82 term in the sound - speed gradient is instrumental in causing the differences , in particular the factor @xmath83 .",
    "the models have very similar temperatures , temperature gradients and @xmath78 gradients , but the larger @xmath78 in models with higher @xmath1 increases @xmath81 in the core , thereby decreasing the value of the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : smallsep ] .",
    "the @xmath78 dependence of the sound - speed gradient explains why models bp04 + and bbs05 - 3 do not behave like bs05(ags , op ) and s06+(ags , op ) .",
    "model bp04 + does not have as low metallicities as bs05(ags , op ) and s06+(ags , op ) and hence fares better than these models .",
    "that said , the metallicity of bp04 + is low enough to give larger fine spacings and separation ratios than are seen in the gs models .",
    "model s06+(ags , op ) does not do well in the core , despite satisfying the helioseismic constraints at the base of the convection zone , because @xmath78 in its core remains similar to that in model bs05(ags , op ) .",
    "the change in opacity in s06+(ags , op ) does however induce changes in the rest of the model ( solar structure is , after all , determined by a set of highly coupled equations ) , and this causes enough difference in the core temperature gradient to give different fine spacings and separation ratios compared with bs05(ags , op ) .",
    "this leads us to the question of the differences in the spacings and ratios of models bp04 and bs05(op ) . that there are differences is not surprising",
    "because even though they have the same metallicity , the models were constructed with slightly different opacities .",
    "the temperature gradient in the radiative zone ( and that includes the solar core ) is determined by the opacity , and hence different opacities will imply a different temperature gradient .",
    "differences in the treatment of diffusion and @xmath55 burning also have a small effect because both change the @xmath78 gradient slightly . nonetheless , the overall opacity differences in the models lead to only modest differences in the fine spacings and separation ratios .    from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that models with low metallicities , such as those with ags abundances , do not satisfy the observational constraints imposed by the bison fine - spacing and separation - ratio data . though subtle changes in physics ( such as in the formulation of diffusion , etc . )",
    "do change the core structure , the changes are sufficiently small to allow us to distinguish between the gs and ags abundances .",
    "in fact , looking at fig .  [",
    "fig : zdiff ] , we might be tempted to determine the solar metallicity using the fine spacings and separation ratios .",
    "uncertainties in solar neutrino predictions arise from uncertainties in inputs to the solar models .",
    "it has , however , been long recognized that the predominant source of uncertainty is the composition ( sears 1964 , bahcall 1966 ) . as a result",
    "there has been a large body of work devoted to evaluating neutrino uncertainties , among the more recent being fiorentini & ricci ( 2002 ) , couvidat et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , boothroyd & sackmann ( 2003 ) , bahcall & pinsonneault ( 2004 ) , young & arnett ( 2005 ) , bahcall & serenelli ( 2005 ) , and bahcall et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "bahcall & serenelli ( 2005 ) performed a very detailed and rigorous investigation of how the abundances of individual elements affect solar neutrino predictions .",
    "their study was motivated by the fact that models with ags abundances show discrepancies with respect to the sun just below the solar convection zone .",
    "bahcall & serenelli ( 2005 ) found that the largest uncertainties in the @xmath84 and @xmath10 neutrinos are due to the uncertainty of the solar iron abundance .",
    "however , uncertainties in oxygen , neon , silicon and sulphur also contribute significantly to the @xmath84 and @xmath10 flux uncertainties .",
    "the p - p neutrino flux is most sensitive the changes in the iron abundance , but because carbon uncertainties are larger , both elements dominate and contribute comparable amounts to the total uncertainty .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath10 neutrinos are the ones detected by the water ( kamiokande & superkamiokande ) and heavy - water detectors ( sudbury neutrino observatory ) .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath84 and pep neutrinos are detected by chlorine detectors . in order to calculate the uncertainty ,",
    "bahcall & serenelli ( 2005 ) adopted what they called a `` conservative '' uncertainty in the abundances .",
    "this uncertainty is basically the difference between the gs and ags abundance values .",
    "their so - called `` optimistic '' uncertainty was based on the error bars on the abundance from the ags table .",
    "the `` conservative '' uncertainties are much larger than the `` optimistic '' uncertainties .",
    "it should be noted that quoted uncertainties in the gs and ags tables are fairly similar .",
    "work done by bahcall et al .",
    "( 2006 ) confirmed these results through an elaborate monte - carlo simulation .",
    "our current work has shown that models with ags abundances fare much worse than models with gs abundances .",
    "we also see , from fig .  [",
    "fig : zdiff ] , that the uncertainties in the abundances are probably much less than the difference between the gs and ags values .",
    "we therefore conclude that the `` conservative '' uncertainties in the neutrino fluxes are unduly pessimistic and can be lowered substantially .",
    "not having done the full analysis , we are unable to say if we are justified in lowering the levels to the `` optimistic '' levels of bahcall & serenelli ( 2005 ) and bahcall et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "our conclusion however comes with one condition , which is related to the model with modified neon abundance ( bbs05 - 3 ) and the fact it did well in comparisons with the bison data .",
    "the solar neon abundance is very uncertain since the abundance can not be measured at the photosphere .",
    "this had led antia & basu ( 2005 ) and bahcall et al .",
    "( 2005b ) to propose increasing the neon abundance as a solution to the helioseismic problems posed by the ags models .",
    "drake & testa ( 2005 ) found that most neighboring stars seem to have a much higher ne / o ratio compared to the sun , which supported increasing the neon abundance .",
    "however , schmelz et al .  ( 2005 ) and young ( 2005 ) each reanalyzed solar x - ray and uv data and found that the ne / o ratio of the sun is indeed low .",
    "bochsler et al . (",
    "2006 ) also suggest a low solar ne / o abundance .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the convection zone also points to the fact that an enhanced neon abundance will not reconcile models with the helioseismic data ( basu & antia 2006 ) .",
    "thus although the neon issue has not been resolved completely , it looks increasingly unlikely that the solar neon to oxygen ratio is high . we are therefore reasonably confident about our claim that uncertainties in the predicted solar neutrino fluxes can be lowered .",
    "we have used bison data collected over 4752 days to determine the frequencies of low - degree acoustic solar oscillation modes .",
    "these frequencies have been used to calculate the fine or small frequency spacings and frequency separation ratios for the sun .",
    "these spacings and ratios have then been used to test different solar models to investigate whether or not we can constrain solar abundances .",
    "we find that models constructed with the older grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) mixture satisfy the fine - spacing and separation - ratio constraints much better than do models with the newer asplund et al .",
    "( 2005 ) abundances .",
    "in fact , models with high metallicity constructed with outdated opacities and equation - of - state data also fare better than do the recent models with asplund et al .",
    "( 2005 ) abundances .",
    "our investigation shows that the fine spacings and separation ratios depend sensitively on the metallicity , and low - metallicity models can be ruled out .",
