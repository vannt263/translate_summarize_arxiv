    "if we carefully take a look at the axioms of the mathematical formalisms,@xcite@xcite we will realize that they are organized by two fundamental ideas : the projective linear representation of the symmetries of the system and the intrinsic aleatory behavior of the events which happen in it .",
    "the ideas mentioned can be summarized in the following table : @xmath0 = i\\hslash $ ( heisenberg - weyl group ) \\\\",

    ".    on the other hand , we shall see that the rules such as the projection postulate of von neumann@xcite and born rule,@xcite or alternatively feynman@xcite rules for combining amplitudes , are a consequence of assuming randomness as the first principle , in the framework of the second descriptive one .",
    "as we explain in this work , such rules for quantum probabilities are the democratic way of assigning a distribution of probabilities for the random transitions between the events of ray space .",
    "it means that all the rays have an equal statistical weight , avoiding any kind of privileged direction .",
    "therefore , a priori , we will to assume an isotropic probability distribution in ray space .",
    "feynman rules , summarized in the next table , represent an equivalent way of providing the rules for quantum distribution probabilities .",
    "they encode , in terms of amplitudes , the underlying logic of ray space:@xcite      + @xmath1 * i * -*generalization of born rule : * _ the probability that a particle arrives _ + _ at a _ given _ position _",

    "+ _ second one . _ +    generally people think that such rules follow an enigmatic logic , because they conceive them from the point of view of the classical rules of logic and probabilities .",
    "but , we will see that feynman rules are not contradictory , they only encode a natural logic for ray space .",
    "as was recognized by its founding fathers,@xcite the essential characteristics of the quantum processes are :    @xmath1 spontaneity    @xmath1 randomness    @xmath1 discontinuity    @xmath1 bifurcation    this picture sharply contrasts with the one corresponding to classical processes , that are inertially stable , deterministic , continuous , and univocal . in other words , at a quantum level , after any event occurs , it can spontaneously follow any of the potential events that the interaction permits .",
    "that is , there is no unique history determined by the initial conditions ; precisely because we have a range of possibilities measured by the probabilities of the aleatory transitions . in this way",
    ", quantum theory gives us a physical image of aleatory processes , as if they were interconnected in a network that takes into account all the possibilities .",
    "quantum theory often surprises and confuses us since it implies a radical change of the classical logic .",
    "it happens because , in a subtle way , all our ordinary languages hide epistemological , ontological and logical assumptions taken from the mechanical conception of the universe .    in the following section",
    ", the prejudices of classical logics will be discussed and removed .",
    "von neumann was the pioneer in this enterprise , realizing that , in order to understand quantum theory , we also must move away from classical logics .",
    "in order to understand the logic of quantum processes , first we have to realize that the theory does not speak about classical probabilities of sets ! only in the case of classical statistical mechanics , the probabilities are defined on sets of points of phase space .",
    "wigner - moyal representation of the theory perhaps can bring us this illusion , but it is certainly not the case .",
    "wigner s distributions are not probabilities .    in order to understand it better ,",
    "let us briefly review the descriptive framework of quantum theory .",
    "such theory describes the transformations of symmetries @xmath5 of the systems . as these symmetries have a group structure , they admit a linear representation @xmath6 in terms of matrices or linear operators in a vector space . and",
    "this is the reason why quantum mechanics works in linear vector spaces ( principle of linear superposition@xcite ) .",
    "in particular , quantum theory works with projective representations in a vector space with a scalar complex field,@xcite that are representations up to a phase factor @xmath7due to the fact that all the vectors belonging to the same ray are physically equivalent .",
    "although phases will be irrelevant in the geometrical examples discussed in this work , they have crucial importance between intrinsic parities of particles and antiparticles , determines dirac equation.@xcite ] in the projective representations of galilei group@xcite and in the group of translations in phase space ( heisenberg- weyl group.@xcite ) the phases make that the projective representations of the momentum and the spatial coordinate do not commute .",
    "this is to say that they are the reason for the uncertainty principle .",
    "so we will focus on the idea that quantum theory works on linear vector spaces . with the sole aim of illustrating it , here we will consider the simplest non trivial case : the vector space corresponding to the euclidean plane . in this case",
    ", rotations @xmath8 are represented by square matrices of the form @xmath9 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\cos \\theta & \\sin \\theta \\\\",
    "-\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta% \\end{array}% \\right]\\]]this matrix rotates vectors in a two dimensional space .",
    "however , as the physical events of the theory @xmath10 do not correspond to vectors @xmath11 but to rays or directions in such space , all the vectors are equivalent up to a scale factor .",
    "then , in some sense , it is not the euclidean geometry who plays the game but projective geometry .",
    "then , with this geometrical picture in mind , notice the following . if we affirm that the event @xmath12  is \" the set of points of ray @xmath12 and similarly in the case of @xmath13 as soon as we try to find the event corresponding to  simultaneously being \" in @xmath12 and @xmath13 we obtain the null ray , which has no sense .",
    "the problem appears no sooner than we try to use the set logic theory which only works well for classical mechanics .",
    "the words between inverted commas are used to point out that the problem rests on the fact that the logic of quantum processes is not combinational but sequential .",
    "quantum logic is not a logic of states , but one of processes or transitions .",
    "as it was originally pointed out by bohr and heisenberg,@xcite the theory does not describe  states \" but processes or transitions between them.@xcite bear in mind that quantum theory was developed for describing quantum jumps between energy levels . with these ideas",
    ", we have to reformulate the problem .",
    "so if we imagine that the two rays represent a process like an aleatory jump of the event @xmath12 to @xmath13 the picture recovers its sense .    returning to the geometry of euclidean plane , notice that the successive projections of a ray @xmath12 onto ray @xmath13 forming a relative angle @xmath14 and again onto @xmath12 result $ ] is diagonal@xmath15 the projector @xmath16 $ ] , so @xmath17 , $ ] @xmath18 @xmath19because the operation @xmath20 has to be proportional to @xmath21 @xmath22 ( this is a projection composed with a dilatation ) with @xmath23 .",
    "notice that the contraction factor @xmath24 defines a geometrical probability which coincides with the born s one .",
    "this is a general property of vector spaces which can be easily verified using dirac s bra - ket notation ( @xmath25 ) @xmath26    von neumann@xcite was the first in associating certainties with projection operators in his bi - valued logic .",
    "according to him , the projector s eigenvalues @xmath27 and @xmath28 of a projector @xmath29 indicate if the system  is \" in a given ray @xmath12 or in the orthogonal one @xmath30 .",
    "so the projector @xmath29 itself represents a logical proposition of sharp true values @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "likewise , the projector onto the orthogonal complement @xmath31 represents the negation of the proposition @xmath32 it is a nice evocative idea but with an ontology still contaminated by classical mechanics .",
    "we will try to reformulate it in the following sense : the eigenvalues @xmath27 and @xmath28 indicate that we have the certainty of making a transition to the same ray , but rule out the possibility of doing it to the orthogonal one . in general , the projection of a ray @xmath33 onto @xmath12 gives as a result the operator @xmath34 of eigenvalues @xmath24 and @xmath35 being the first one a number ( between @xmath28 and @xmath36 which measures the degree of certainty of making the transition . in this way , sharp true values @xmath28 and @xmath27 of von neumann s idea are extended to the real number interval @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "summarizing , as we have explained above , the operation @xmath38 that represents the projection of ray @xmath33 onto @xmath39 keeps close analogy with the intersection of sets ( @xmath40 ) which we will denote as @xmath41this will be our definition of quantum  intersection \" or and @xmath42 . however , it is important to remember that projections in general do not commute .",
    "so our and between rays is , in general , non commutative . and",
    ", this is precisely the essential distinctive character of the logics for the quantum processes proposed here , no taken into account by earlier attempts .",

    "he did not succeed , because the quantum logic is not a black and white s one , is a logic of greys .",
    "the third row of the table represents the history of a polarization experiment , and the fifth one the history corresponding to the double slit experiment .",
    "these are the two basic experiments chosen by dirac@xcite for introducing the theory in his _ principles of quantum mechanics_. feynman believed that these experiments encapsulate all the mystery of the quantum.@xcite    the paradox that brings to light the polarization experiment is the following : suppose that , in the history of the third row , @xmath12 and @xmath44 represent the events corresponding to the passage of a photon through two filters that polarize light in two orthogonal directions ( @xmath62 ) ; and that @xmath33 is the event associated with the passage through an intermediate filter which polarizes light in a direction on the same plane , forming an angle @xmath63 with the one determined by the first polarizer , and an angle @xmath64 @xmath63 with the second one .",
    "the corresponding quantum history @xmath65has its analog in the boolean expression ( capital letters indicate sets ) @xmath66but , from the point of view of the classical reasoning , the light would not pass through the third polarizer .",
    "but , in spite of the fact that the projection of ray @xmath12 onto the orthogonal ray @xmath30 is null , the magic of quantum logic rests on the fact that the projection of @xmath12 onto @xmath33 and then onto @xmath30 is different from zero .",
    "so , the history has a degree of certainty @xmath67the explanation is analogous to the tunnel effect . a classically forbidden history , as the passage through a potential barrier , is only possible at quantum level because intermediate events that have non null projections .    in the case of the double slits",

    "for instance , crossed terms between positive ( electron ) and negative energy levels ( positron ) are responsible for the trembling motion of the positron - electron charge ( _ zitterbewegung _ ) which , in each subspace of definite sign , acquires a magnetic moment .",
    "it is immediate to see that , if @xmath29 commutes with @xmath80 and @xmath81 then the interference vanishes .",

    "the slits do not play as filters in ordinary space but in ray space .    for those who feel the vertigo of _ making equilibrium over the logic tightrope of quantum theory_,@xcite the amplitude representation offers a momentary relaxation that maintains some parts of the reasoning in terms of boolean logic . in this case",

    "these two paths @xmath88 and @xmath89 , that circulate in reverse sense , are responsible for the interference @xmath90 in other words , as the probability of a path is the amplitude of going forward and coming backward , this simple rule for the  logic of paths \" open the possibility of having closed loops which enclose  area \" different from zero .",
    "this is a general property and , perhaps , the most striking example is the aharonov - bohm@xcite effect , in which the amplitude of the closed loop which encircles the solenoid acquires a phase proportional to the magnetic flux .",

    "to conclude , we desire to emphasize that born rule in quantum theory plays the same role as the pythagoras theorem in euclidean geometry . in a framework such as analytic geometry",
    ", one can decide to take it as starting point to introduce the notion of distance .",
    "otherwise , one looks for another framework based on basic assumptions , in order to derive it as a theorem , as is the case of the synthetic euclidean geometry .",
    "this last point of view was adopted by the author in ref .   where the logic of quantum processes was taken as the basic assumption . for this purpose",
    ", it is necessary to generalize kolmogorov s axioms,@xcite originally developed for the classical theory of sets . here ,",
    "using laplace s notion of probability , we show in a more heuristic way , how its rule can be derived .",
    "first , we will argue that , in general , the absolute probability @xmath97 of a history is given by :    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the dimension of the space ray , and @xmath72 , the identity matrix , represents the universe of sample space .    for turning the ideas more concrete , we will consider the idealized model of a _",
    "quantum _ die , essentially a six - level system .",
    "a quantum die differs from a classical one in the sense that all its faces represent orthogonal rays in ray space , because the corresponding events are mutually exclusive .",
    "we are going to assume that when playing with einstein , _ the lord is subtle but not malicious _ , so the die is  perfectly balanced \" ; therefore all faces have the same a priori probability ( isotropy of ray space ) . in this case",
    ", laplace would say that the probability of obtaining any face is @xmath100 ( number of cases divided the number of total possible ones ) .",
    "the reasoning can be formalized as follows : the event @xmath101 , e.g. obtaining the face @xmath102 , is given by the set @xmath103 a subset of the sample space @xmath104 .",
    "so , under equal _ a priori _ probabilities for any elements of the sample space , the probability of obtaining @xmath101 is directly calculated as the ratio of the cardinal of set @xmath101 ( @xmath105 ) to the cardinal of the sample space @xmath106similarly , in the quantum case , events are represented by projectors , for instance , the face @xmath107 is represented by the operator @xmath108 and the sample space by the development of the identity @xmath109 but , in order to obtain a probability equal to @xmath110 , we can not take cardinals because projectors are not sets !",
    "therefore , we have to generalize this notion in ray space .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that the analogous operation is taking the trace @xmath111 in fact , tracing is the natural generalization of counting .",
    "for example : each elementary projector has a unit trace and the trace of the identity is the dimension of the space .",
    "moreover , as the trace is invariant under rotations , so it is the only invariant counting we can define in ray space .",
    "however , in contrast with the classical dice , quantum dice admit more than one representation of the sample space (  bohr s complementary principle \" )",
    ". we can rotate the die and obtain a new base of orthogonal faces represented by the projectors @xmath112 then we can ask the following question : if we know , for example , that the face @xmath113 has gone out , which is the conditional probability of obtaining the face @xmath114 ? in this case , this is the history @xmath115 which is represented by the operator @xmath116 but , as we have seen @xmath117so tracing both sides of the equality @xmath118or equivalently @xmath119since the trace of any elementary projector is one .",
    "the first member of the equality is the conditional probability of obtaining the face @xmath13 having obtained the face @xmath12 before , @xmath120which coincides with the expression originally proposed by born.@xmath121    in general , the probability of a history @xmath43 which begins at an initial event @xmath12 , results in @xmath122which coincides with the degree of certainty @xmath123 of the history .",
    "the right side of last expression was originally proposed by schwinger@xcite in the context of his algebra of measurements.@xcite later , the trace formula was rediscovered , but consistent conditions were imposed _",
    "ad hoc _ in order to keep boolean logic . however , the only logic that reproduces the standard formalism of quantum theory is the one exposed in this paper .",
    "let us consider again the history of three events @xmath124 then , if we compute the conditional probability of the last event @xmath44 given the two first @xmath125 we have @xmath126 } { % p(a\\sqcap b ) } \\notag \\\\ \\\\ & = & \\frac{tr(p_{c}p_{b}p_{a}p_{b}p_{c})}{tr(p_{b}p_{a}p_{b})}\\end{aligned}\\]]now , if we look this expression carefully , we observe it can be rewritten as @xmath127where the operator @xmath128is equivalent to the projection operator onto ray @xmath33 . in this way",

    "this actualization property of conditional probabilities is equivalent to the von neumann rule .",
    "physics has inherited the notions of classical mechanics .",
    "the physical explanation of the problem of motion is essentially deterministic .",
    "so , we have seen that is necessary to dig deeply in order to find the roots of the problem . and , above all",
    ", it is imperative to cut these roots in order to understand quantum theory .",
    "this is not an easy enterprise due to the fact that mechanic philosophy is ubiquitous in our language and has installed in our minds .",
    "the most difficult point to interpret is understanding the reason of movement .",
    "notice that , contrary to what happens in the mechanical universe , at quantum scale , the interactions do not cause changes ; they only open the door so as the transitions can take place .",
    "the quantum processes occur spontaneously by chance .",

    "it is claimed that the state of the system evolves continuously , as if after an event the system followed by  inertia \" the continuous evolution of probabilities determined by this equation . but this path takes us to a dead end : explaining the discontinuity through continuity , and chance by determinism .",
    "so , the conceptual revolution of quantum theory will only be completed after the new conception of the problem of motion will be generally accepted . on the whole ,",
    "quantum phenomena show us that aleatory processes are spontaneous and chance plays the role of the  inertia principle \" in the theory ( the spontaneous persistence of motion )",
    ". any other attempt would be another way of returning to the theory of  hidden variables \" .    at present",
    ", the big question is the opposite one . how to explain the apparent determinism we observe at classical level from the aleatory behavior quantum phenomena .",
    "the first answer to this question was outlined by dirac;@xcite then feynman@xcite completed this elegant idea developing his path integral formalism . in this framework , all paths , continuous or discontinuous , are allowed and the classical trajectory is just the most probable sequence in the network of potential events .    in conclusion ,",
    "the paradigm of a legal universe is absent in quantum theory .",
    "laws \" are just symmetries or reduced to the  law of big numbers \" .",
    "chance is the true physical principle of the theory .",
    "the second principle , symmetry , only plays the role of a descriptive one .",
    "in fact , it proposes a framework for the theory from which the logic and probabilistic distributions for the physical processes can be deduced .",
    "in fact , as the processes are random , we are just limited ( as in the case of the die ) to find the symmetries in the system which allow us to determine the probability for these processes .    as symmetries have the group mathematical structure , we can establish an homomorphism with the non singular square matrix .",
    "that is a linear representation of the group of symmetries of the system .",
    "in particular , the mathematical framework of quantum theory is the projective representation in a complex ray space . for the phases we can generalize it to another internal group of symmetry . ]",
    "this is to say that the representation of rays and matrices are defined up to a phase factor , because , at the end of the day , probabilities only depend on the square of the amplitudes .",
    "this phase factor is a non trivial element .",
    "this one is responsible for the non commutativity of translations in phase space and , in general , for the interference effects characteristic of quantum processes .",
    "moreover , it also explains the classical limit of the theory .    to sum up , we have seen that the geometry of the ray space determines the logic of the quantum processes and , as a consequence , the quantum probabilistic rules such as born s and von neumann s ones , historically postulated _ ad hoc_. this logic and probabilistic rules a priori sound enigmatic , since we have to leave aside the familiar boolean logic and kolmogorov s notion of probabilities .",
    "however , if we finally accept that the ray space is the true scenery where the events occur , the new logic is inherently derived from geometry .",
    "the propositions of this logic are chains of sequential paths of events ( histories ) that have two equivalent representations .",
    "one uses of projector operators , and the other one works in terms of complex amplitudes which follow feynman rules . in this rules , which describe the basic experiments of polarization and interference ,",
    "is encapsulated the mysterious logic of the quantum processes .",

    "<S> the classical notions of continuity and mechanical causality are left in order to reformulate the quantum theory starting from two principles : i ) the intrinsic randomness of quantum process at microphysical level , ii ) the projective representations of symmetries of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the second principle determines the geometry and then a new logic for describing the history of events ( feynman s paths ) that modifies the rules of classical probabilistic calculus . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of classical trajectory is replaced by a history of spontaneous , random an discontinuous events . </S>",
    "<S> so the theory is reduced to determining the probability distribution for such histories according with the symmetries of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the representation of the logic in terms of amplitudes leads to feynman rules and , alternatively , its representation in terms of projectors results in the schwinger trace formula . </S>"
