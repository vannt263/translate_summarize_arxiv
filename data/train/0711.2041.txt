    "g117-b15a and r548 are pulsating white dwarfs with atmospheres dominated by hydrogen .",
    "these stars are called davs or zz ceti stars .",
    "their effective temperatures are close to 12,000 k. they are non - radial , g - mode pulsators ( the restoring force is buoyancy ) .",
    "g117-b15a is the most stable optical clock known .",
    "the rate of change in period ( p= dp / dt ) of its most stable mode ( 215s ) is @xmath0 s / s @xcite .",
    "that is , g117-b15a loses one `` tick '' every 1.7 billion years .",
    "we can use this well - measured p  to constrain among other things the mass of the axion , the best motivated dark matter candidate and in general , the emission rate of weakly interacting particles . while measuring a p  for r548 s most stable mode ( near 213s ) is less trivial because it is a doublet , the current upper limit",
    ", @xmath1 s / s @xcite , also indicates that in the near future r548 may become useful to constrain the axion mass as well .",
    "a p   of order @xmath2 for davs is consistent with a slow increase in period due to the cooling of the interior .",
    "it is an evolutionary timescale @xmath3 a measure of how fast the star is cooling . knowing p",
    ", we can determine how much energy a star like g117-b15a is losing every second .",
    "this energy loss includes of course the radiation of photons ( mestel cooling , @xcite ) , but in principle could also include the emission of weakly interacting particles . while neutrinos immediately come to mind , the standard model of particle physics predicts that neutrino emission should be negligible in g117-b15a and r548 @xcite .",
    "one possibility includes axions and we apply our method to the latter in the present study .",
    "axions arise from an elegant solution to a problem with the standard model of particle physics , the strong cp problem ( e.g. @xcite ) . along with supersymmetric particles",
    ", axions are currently favored candidates for dark matter .",
    "but they have not been discovered ( neither have supersymmetric particles ) and the theory of axions fails to place any constraint on their mass .",
    "the possible contribution of axions to dark matter depends on their mass .",
    "the mass of axions determines how strongly they interact with the matter we know , with more massive axions interacting more strongly . in turn , the stronger the interaction of axions with matter or light , the larger their emission rate . with pulsating white dwarfs , we can constrain the axion emission rates and therefore their mass .",
    "we determine limits on the emission of weakly interacting particles by comparing their cooling effect on a white dwarf model with the observed cooling rates of that star ( given by p ) .",
    "the strength of those limits depends on the uncertainties involved in the measurement of the p  and in the modeling .",
    "this method has been used before by @xcite and @xcite to derive an upper mass limit for axions . while the limits on the axion obtained by those authors were stronger than those obtained through other methods",
    "( see @xcite for a review across fields of study ) , we now have the tools to greatly strengthen them .",
    "we present here the first study that takes into account the modeling uncertainties in a systematic way , allowing us to derive a strong upper mass limit for the axion .",
    "we present our results in a way that facilitates their application to other weakly interacting particles .",
    "we also publish for the first time the p  we would expect to observe in r548 as a function of the emission rate of weakly interacting particles .",
    "together with a future measurement of p  for r548 , these results can be used to reinforce the limits given by g117-b15a .    in @xcite ,",
    "thereafter paper i , we used a systematic , fine grid search to find best fit models to g117-b15a and r548 .",
    "we were able to define the regions of parameter space the fits occupied . in this work",
    ", we use monte carlo simulations to calculate p s  that include theoretical uncertainties , for varying axion mass .",
    "we begin with a brief introduction to axions in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we give an overview of the work done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we detail our method in section 4 , discuss our results in section 5 , and conclude in section 6 .",
    "the standard model of particle physics does not explain why charge - parity ( cp ) should be violated in weak interactions but not in strong interactions .",
    "one would therefore expect the neutron to have an electric dipole moment .",
    "experiments have placed an upper limit on the neutron s electric dipole of @xmath4 e - cm ( electron charge @xmath5 length of dipole ) , 10 orders of magnitude below the predicted value @xcite .    in more technical terms , in qcd ,",
    "the neutron electric dipole moment arises from a cp ( as well as c and p ) violating term in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "this electric dipole moment is predicted to be of order @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a free parameter in the theory .",
    "the experimental limit of @xmath8 means that @xmath7 is less than @xmath9 .",
    "theoretical physicists do not understand why @xmath7 has to be so small .",
    "this is called the strong cp problem and can be solved elegantly by the introduction of a new symmetry .",
    "this symmetry , added to the lagrangian of the fundamental interactions , is called the peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry gives rise to axions .",
    "the theory does not place any limit on their mass .",
    "axions can couple to photons , electrons ( leptons ) and nucleons ( baryons ) .",
    "the relative strength of each coupling depends on one or more of the peccei - quinn charges of the u and d quarks and the electron ( denoted @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 respectively . )",
    "those charges can be between 0 and a number of order 1 and are not constrained by the theory .",
    "this gives rises to a continuum of axion models .",
    "two simple models include the kvsz model @xcite , where @xmath13 ( no coupling to electrons ) , and the dfsz model @xcite , where @xmath14 .    in this paper , we focus on dfsz axions , those that interact with electrons . for a more complete review of the different axion models and their interaction with light and matter ,",
    "see @xcite . in white dwarf interiors ,",
    "the dominant axion emission mechanism would be electron bremsstrahlung , where an electron emits an axion as it gets accelerated in the neighborhood of an ion . the axion emission rate ( per unit mass ) for that process",
    "may be expressed as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , the strength of the axion - electron coupling is given by equation [ gae ] below .",
    "@xmath19 is a numerical fit provided by @xcite .",
    "it is of order 1 throughout most of the interior of a typical white dwarf model ( e.g. figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the strength of the axion - electron coupling is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are free parameters . for dfsz axions ,",
    "the coupling to electrons is @xmath23 orders of magnitude greater than the coupling to photons ( assuming @xmath24 ) .",
    "following in @xcite s footsteps , we shall not make make any assumptions on the value of @xmath22 and simply state that the quantity we are constraining is @xmath25 .",
    "we shall , however , refer to it simply as the `` axion mass '' .",
    "in a pioneering work , @xcite used g117-b15a s p   to obtain a limit on the axion mass . at the time , the p   measured ( @xmath26 , @xcite ) for that star was uncertain , and much higher than the one expected from simple mestel cooling . using models available at the time @xcite and a simple semi - analytical treatment ,",
    "@xcite found an average axion mass of 8 mev .",
    "individual values , depending upon the model chosen and value of observed p   considered ( p  @xmath27p , p , and p   + @xmath28p ) allowed a range between 0 mev and 20 mev for the axion mass .",
    "@xcite revisited the problem with a new measured value of p , that had since decreased to what was expected from simple mestel cooling @xcite : @xmath29 @xcite . in their work , @xcite performed an asteroseismological study of g117-b15a to find its mass , helium layer mass , and hydrogen layer mass . to reduce the number of parameters to fit , they fixed the internal composition to that found from stellar evolution calculations by @xcite , and the effective temperature to the latest spectroscopic estimate at the time , 11,620 k @xcite .",
    "their best fit model had a mass of 0.55 @xmath30 , a helium layer mass @xmath31 and a hydrogen layer mass @xmath32 . on the average ,",
    "the periods of that model are 5 seconds away from the observed periods .",
    "in contrast , the models we use in the present study fit to better than 1 second .",
    "@xcite considered only small uncertainties in effective temperature ( 200k ) and found that they led to a 4% uncertainty in the calculated p s .",
    "they also considered larger uncertainties in mass and central oxygen abundance and found that those had less of an effect on the model s p s   than the effective temperature .",
    "a mass uncertainty of .02 @xmath30  ( 3% ) led to a 6% uncertainty in p s . and",
    "considering a full range of core composition ( 0% carbon to pure carbon ) changed the p s   only by 5% .",
    "they concluded that uncertainties other than the one in the measured p   were insignificant and could be ignored altogether .",
    "they found a tight constraint on the axion mass : 4 mev .",
    "if we adopt corsico et al.s best fit parameters for g117-b15a , and follow the same method using our models , we obtain a similar limit on the axion mass .    to place things in prospective , the best dfsz axion mass limits aside from that of @xcite and the ones presented here come from the observation of red giants and horizontal branch stellar populations in clusters .",
    "if axions were massive enough , they would cool the core of stars and have an observable effect on the morphology of those populations .",
    "the best limit found using this method is 9 mev @xcite .",
    "such limits depend on the assumed core mass in the models , a rather uncertain quantity .",
    "the pulsating white dwarf method does not suffer from such large uncertainties .",
    "since the work done by @xcite , a newer value of p  = @xmath33 has been obtained @xcite .",
    "the new value has a smaller measurement error , and could help constrain the axion mass better .",
    "more importantly , we take into account additional modeling uncertainties that have been ignored in previous analyses .",
    "the better we account for those uncertainties , the stronger our limit on the axion mass will be .",
    "we will see that this leads us to different conclusions than the authors mentioned above .",
    "for a mixture of carbon and oxygen , as in the interior of our white dwarf models , the axion emission rate is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the carbon and oxygen abundance , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the axion emission rates in pure carbon and pure oxygen respectively . combining equation [ epsax ] and [ epsmixed ]",
    "we have : @xmath39.\\ ] ] we distinguish @xmath19 in pure carbon and pure oxygen by using subscripts .    integrating over the mass of the model",
    ", we obtain the axion luminosity . while we carry the exact integration numerically in our models , it is useful at this point to write down an approximate expression for the axion luminosity .",
    "we use the internal properties of a fiducial model , chosen because it matches g117-b15a s periods and p  for the 215s mode very closely .",
    "this fiducial model has @xmath40 = 12656 k , @xmath41 = 0.602 @xmath30 , a helium layer mass of @xmath42 , and a hydrogen layer mass of @xmath43 .",
    "we display the internal properties of the fiducial model in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "following the example set forth in @xcite , we make the following approximations : 1 ) we set @xmath44 throughout the model ; 2 ) we also set @xmath45 and @xmath46 constant ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "the axion luminosity is then @xmath49 where @xmath50 . for the fiducial model s",
    "core composition , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we obtain @xmath53 this approximate expression is 7% accurate for our fiducial model .",
    "before we include axions in our models , we need to make sure we have reliable models of the stars under study , g117-b15a and r548 .",
    "we performed our own asteroseismological analysis of those stars in paper i. we varied 4 parameters , including the effective temperature and the helium layer mass , @xmath54 ( in addition to the stellar mass and the hydrogen layer mass , @xmath55 ) . in paper i , we explored systematically a number of sources of uncertainties in our models and concluded that we could adequately account for them by treating equally all models that matched the observed periods to better than 1 second . with that cut - off , we defined the regions of parameter space our models occupied .",
    "we found that our best fit models were hot and/or massive compared to the spectroscopy , though they were not completely inconsistent with the latter .",
    "work is in progress to resolve this apparent discrepancy .",
    "our calculations are self - consistent and we proceed to derive meaningful results",
    ".      having narrowed down the regions of parameter space occupied by best fit models for g117-b15a and r548 , the next step is to derive rates of period change for those models along with the associated uncertainties .",
    "this is a classic monte carlo problem . for g117-b15a , we chose @xmath56 , @xmath57 ( instead of @xmath58 ) , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 as our 4 independent variables , where @xmath57 is defined by @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined so that the simulated populations occupy the region of parameter space in the @xmath62 plane defined by the results from our astereseismological fits .",
    "for each family of solutions we found in paper i , without including axions just yet , we generated a random population ( n=500 ) .",
    "we display the distribution of the models of each of the populations in figure [ samplepopg117 ] .",
    "we have two possible families of fits for g117-b15a .",
    "one has a thicker hydrogen layer ( @xmath63 ) and occupies the high mass , low effective temperature region of the @xmath62 plane .",
    "the other has a thin hydrogen layer ( @xmath64 ) and occupies the higher effective temperature ( lower mass ) region of the @xmath62 plane .",
    "the thin hydrogen fits to g117-b15a are very similar to the fits to r548 .",
    "while this makes the thin hydrogen fits more attractive than the thick hydrogen fits ( by `` thick '' we mean `` not as thin '' ) , we can not discard the latter as a viable possibility on that basis alone .",
    "we shall consider both families when constraining the axion mass .        ' '' ''    & & r548 +    ' '' ''    @xmath55 & @xmath65 & @xmath66 & @xmath66 +    ' '' ''    p ( observed ) [ s ] & & 213 +  p ( calculated ) [ s ] & @xmath67 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 +  p  ( observed ) @xmath70 $ ] & & @xmath71 +    ' '' ''    p  ( calculated ) @xmath70 $ ] & @xmath72 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 +    for each model in each population , we proceeded with calculating a p. we checked that the period and p   distribution for each of the populations were close to gaussian and found that they were .",
    "for each population ( family of fits ) we calculated the mean period and p. we list the results in table [ means ] with one sigma error bars .",
    "remember that these results assume axions do not exist and that the cooling is due entirely to photons .",
    "for g117-b15a , the thick hydrogen fit p  is two sigma below the observed value",
    ". however , we can not discard this solution based on a low p  alone , as we can always increase the cooling rate and raise the value of p  by adding axion emission to the models .",
    "next we included axion production in our models and repeated the procedure for each different axion mass .",
    "we confirm an important fact @xcite first pointed out : the periods themselves are insensitive to the axion mass ( for @xmath21 up to 30 mev at least ) .",
    "the reason for this small dependence is that axion emission does not introduce any `` bumps '' into the brunt - visl frequency .",
    "it merely slightly lowers it throughout the degenerate core .",
    "this allows us to meaningfully compare the calculated p s  with the observed value .",
    "in figure [ pdotmax ] we show p   as a function of the axion luminosity for g117-b15a and r548 . while we included axions specifically in our models , the p s  depend only on the total luminosity , not on the exact nature of the weakly interacting particles responsible for the `` unseen '' loss of energy .",
    "our results may therefore directly be generalized to weakly interacting particles other than axions .",
    "the thin hydrogen solution for g117-b15a places an upper limit of @xmath75 erg / s for the energy loss rate due to weakly interacting particles . for axions",
    ", this translates to an upper limit of @xmath76 on the axion - electron coupling constant @xmath77  ( 13.5 mev on the axion mass).the thick hydrogen family of fits ( taken alone ) constrains the `` unseen '' luminosity to be between @xmath78 and @xmath79 erg / s .",
    "these limits translate to @xmath80 @xmath77  @xmath81 ( axions between 10.4 and 26.5 mev in mass ) . combining the two families together",
    ", we can place a conservative upper limit of @xmath79 erg / s on the luminosity of weakly interacting particles that would be emitted in the interior of g117-b15a , and a 26.5 mev upper limit on the axion mass . for r548",
    ", we are still awaiting a better determined p   to allow us to obtain a potentially tighter constraint on the emission of weakly interacting particles in white dwarfs .",
    "we computed p s   for the 215s mode in g117-b15a and the 213s mode in r548 first for models without axions , and then for models with axions of increasing mass .",
    "the thin hydrogen , zero axion models for g117-b15a have a p  of @xmath82 , consistent with the observed value of @xmath33 .",
    "the zero axion , thick hydrogen models have a p  of @xmath83 , 2 sigma below the observed p  and require additional cooling through axions to become consistent with that observed value .",
    "the zero axion models for r548 have a p  similar to the thin hydrogen p  for g117-b15a ( @xmath84 ) , consistent with the best current limit on p   for r548 s 213s mode .",
    "if we believe that g117-b15a must be similar to r548 , then we find an upper limit on the axion luminosity of @xmath85 erg / s , corresponding to an axion - electron coupling constant @xmath77  @xmath86 , or an axion mass of 13.5 mev .",
    "a second family of fits with thicker hydrogen layers relaxes that limit to @xmath87 erg / s , @xmath77  @xmath81 or @xmath88 26.5 mev .",
    "what makes this limit unique is not the fact that it is lower than previous limits .",
    "what makes it unique is its strength .",
    "it is based on an unbiased exploration of the parameter space of the models .",
    "compared to typical axion searches ( see @xcite for a review ) , the present analysis involved well - known physics and relatively small , well - identified uncertainties , considered systematically",
    ". improved asteroseismological models will help us choose between the two families of best fits for g117-b15a and improve this limit .",
    "an even longer data baseline for g117-b15a will reduce the size of the error bars on the measured p  and further narrow the allowed range for the axion mass .",
    "we can soon expect a useful p  for r548 as well , which will reinforce the results of this study . as a part of his planet",
    "search around pulsating white dwarfs , mullally has determined upper limits of @xmath89 s / s for an additional 9 white dwarfs @xcite and has identified more blue edge davs with stable modes . with argos @xcite , the high - speed photometry data collected at mcdonald observatory as a part of the on - going observation of hot davs should begin to yield measurements of p s  for those stars within the next 3 to 5 years .",
    "it is merely a question of time until we can place an even tighter constraint on the emission of weakly interacting particles in these stars .    in the present study",
    ", we assumed that any unseen source of energy loss was due to axions .",
    "the results we present can readily be used to constrain the emission of other weakly interacting particles possibly produced inside white dwarfs , such as supersymmetric particles .",
