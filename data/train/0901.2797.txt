    "<S> where the order parameter is the contact density @xmath3 ( defined as the ratio of the number @xmath4 of contacts over the total length @xmath5 ) , the notion of `` infinite disorder fixed point '' means that the thermal fluctuations of @xmath6 within a given sample , become negligeable at large scale with respect to sample - to - sample fluctuations . </S>",
