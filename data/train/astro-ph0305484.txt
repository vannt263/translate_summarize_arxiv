    "effective strategies to detect brown dwarfs are proper motion surveys ( e.g @xcite ) , wide field ccd surveys in star forming regions , open clusters like the pleiades ( e.g @xcite ) , or the new generation of optical and near - infrared all sky surveys like the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , the deep near infrared survey @xcite , and the 2micron all sky survey @xcite .",
    "so far , denis has produced a list of @xmath0 300 nearby very low - mass objects @xcite , and a similar number has been detected by 2mass @xcite . to date , several hundreds of nearby free - floating ultra - cool and brown dwarfs have been identified , and many more candidates are waiting for confirmation .",
    "this nearby sample is ideal for resolving ultra - cool and brown dwarfs binaries , and is large enough for statistical studies .",
    "while systematic surveys of their physical properties are just starting , we already have indications that binary brown dwarfs are not rare . , the first brown dwarf in the pleiades with confirmed lithium @xcite , turned out to be a spectroscopic binary @xcite . several direct imaging surveys in the field or in open clusters using the high spatial resolution provided by both hst and/or adaptive optics led to the discovery of a significant number of binaries @xcite .",
    "there are several key questions which need to be answered and for which brown dwarf binaries are an important piece of the puzzle : where do free - floating brown dwarfs originate ?",
    "are they ejected stellar embryos @xcite , or do they form more isolated like ordinary stars due to fragmentation of collapsing molecular cloud clumps @xcite ?",
    "one can then ask , how the binary properties of brown dwarfs , such as the frequency , distribution of separations , distribution of mass - ratios ( is there a lower mass limit for companions to brown dwarfs ? ) , or the relation between orbital period and eccentricity , compare to the properties of stellar binaries .",
    "these properties hold important clues on the origin of ( binary ) brown dwarfs .",
    "an agreement of brown dwarf and stellar binary properties would suggest the same formation mechanism for both types of objects .    resolved brown dwarf binaries provide a very valuable opportunity to measure sub - stellar dynamical masses .",
    "the first such measurement has been reported by @xcite in the brown dwarf binary gliese 569b , discovered by @xcite .",
    "dynamical masses for brown dwarfs of different ages are very much needed , as the mass estimates currently depend on untested theoretical evolutionary tracks , model atmospheres , and assumptions on the internal structure of brown dwarfs .",
    "in particular , a brown dwarf with a given age and mass might have very similar colours and luminosity as a younger brown dwarf with a lower mass .",
    "this degeneracy in the mass - luminosity relation for sub - stellar objects makes it very hard to pin down the physical properties of brown dwarfs , and to achieve the interplay between observation and theory which is necessary in order to improve , adapt , and fine - tune models , and to guide the interpretation of the observations .",
    "a search for binary brown dwarfs , and a detailed study of their properties directly addresses these questions .",
    "the pleiades , the first cluster in which a significant population of ( coeval ) brown dwarfs was identified , is at a distance of 125 pc .",
    "this makes it hard to detect and resolve binary brown dwarfs which separations less than 20 a.u .",
    "orbital periods of resolved brown dwarf binaries in the pleiades will be excessively long ( @xmath1 several 100 yrs ) , making it impractical to compute their orbits and to derive dynamical masses . a recent search for binaries among 34 very low mass members of the pleiades by @xcite with hst - wfpc2 and adaptive optics system of cfht did not lead to the discovery of any binary , indicating a lack of wide brown dwarfs binaries .",
    "nearby free - floating brown dwarfs do not form a coeval sample , but they are close enough to measure their distance ( angular parallax ) precisely , and - by using hst / wfpc2 - it is possible to detect and resolve binary brown dwarfs with separations down to 0.4 a.u .",
    "( 006 at 7pc ) .",
    "the objects we study here have distances between 7 and 105 pc . for a prototypical brown dwarf binary with a separation of 0060 , component masses of 0.045 m@xmath2 and 0.030 m@xmath2 , and a circular orbit",
    ", the orbital period would be respectively between @xmath0 1 and @xmath0 100 years .",
    "within the next 5 to 10 years dynamical masses for a wide range of brown dwarf binary companions could be determined .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the observations and the data analysis . in section 3",
    "we present and discuss the results we obtained on each binary , in section 4 we perform an analysis of the results , and in section 5 we discuss these results in the framework of current models of formation and evolution of free - floating brown dwarfs .",
    "our initial sample consists primarily of 34 objects detected by the near - infrared sky surveys denis , 2mass and sdss .",
    "they have been selected by analysing their positions in a colour - magnitude diagram , looking for the reddest objects .    in order to increase the sample of objects and the quality of the statistical study ,",
    "the total sample presented in this paper put together data from our own program ( go8720 , p.i brandner ) with data from two other hst programs .",
    "we thus analyse data from the public hst archive coming from programs go8146 , p.i reid , including 21 objects @xcite , and program go8581 , p.i reid @xcite , including 84 objects .",
    "the total sample thus had 134 objects .",
    "the complete list of targets of the program is shown in table [ targets ] .",
    "eleven of these objects were already previously identified as binary brown dwarfs .",
    "the observations occurred between february 2000 and august 2001 during hst cycles 8 and 9 .",
    "they have been carried out in snapshot mode .",
    "each object was observed with the planetary camera of hst / wfpc2 , in the f675w ( 600s ) and f814w ( 300s ) for our own program , in the f606w ( 100s ) and f814w ( 300@xmath3350s ) filters for program go8146 ( cycle 8 , p.i reid , see @xcite ) and in the f814w ( 100s , 200s or 400s ) and f1042 m ( 500s ) filters for program go8581 ( cycle 9 , p.i reid , @xcite ) .",
    "some objects have been observed twice : once during our own hst program and the second time during hst program go9157 ( p.i martn ) .",
    "our targets are very red , thus the observations in f814w were sensitive to even lower mass companions than the observations in f675w , despite the shorter exposure time and the lower quantum efficiency of wfpc2 at longer wavelengths . for our program ( go8720 ) , only one exposure was taken in each filter for each object , thus not allowing to reject cosmic rays automatically .",
    "this choice was done to minimise overheads and maximise exposure times .",
    "we processed the data in two steps .",
    "we first identified the multiple systems either directly when resolved or by measuring the ellipticity of all the targets to look for elongated objects , using the iraf _ phot _ task .",
    "all the objects with an ellipticity greater than 0.10 were suspected to be a binary , but all images have been inspected manually anyway to be sure we did not miss any candidate .    we used a custom - made psf fitting program to compute the precise separation , position angle and flux ratio of each binary system .",
    "this program makes a non - linear fit of the binary system , fitting both components at the same time .",
    "it uses different psf stars from throughout the sample and for each of them compute a model of the binary system ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the five free parameters for this model are the flux ratio and the pixel coordinates of the two components of the binary system .",
    "a cross correlation between the model and the binary system gives us the best values for these five parameters . to minimise the effects due to the slight position sensitivity of the psf shape in the detector and the slight change of hst focus from one orbit to another",
    ", we built a library of 8 different psf stars in each filter .",
    "as 8 psf stars were not available in every field of view , we used the same library of psf stars to analyse all the pictures .",
    "comparison with analysis of images where 8 psf stars were present in the field showed that this has no significant effect on the accuracy of the results .      to evaluate the accuracy of our psf fitting program , and look for systematic errors",
    ", we used the program on 4950 simulated binaries , covering a range of 11 various input flux ratios ( varying from 0.05 to 1.0 , expressed as @xmath4 ) , 135 various separations ( varying from 0060 to 0600 , by steps of 0004 , thus oversampling the pixel scale ) and 3 position angles ( 0 , 22.5 and 45 degrees , measured in the detector s referential ) .",
    "it is important to note that these 3 angles , modulo 45 degrees , are sufficient to characterise 16 different position angles by symmetry in the detector .",
    "the simulated binaries were built using unresolved objects from the sample ( different than the psf stars used to make the psf fitting ) .",
    "we made all these calibration in the f814w filter and expect it to be the same in the other filters .",
    "the s / n does not influence significantly the conclusions of the calibrations since the library of psf stars used to make the psf fitting spans a large range of s / n in each filters .",
    "figure [ calib2 ] gives an overview of these calibrations for the separation and the position angle .",
    "both plots show a periodic pattern which period is correlated to the pixel scale ( p@xmath52@xmath6pixel scale , with a trigonometric scaling factor depending on the position angle ) .",
    "this effect is mostly due to the periodic errors introduced by the shift by a fraction of a pixel that we use to fit the binaries .",
    "it appears that the program gives good astrometric results . for our study",
    ", we will consider that the systematic errors on the separation and on the position angle are equal to the average of the errors , and that the 1@xmath7 uncertainties are equal to the standard deviation of the errors .",
    "the systematic errors are negligible ( less than 00005 on the separation and almost zero on the position angle ) .",
    "the 1@xmath7 uncertainty on the separation is 00028 .",
    "for the position angle it appears more appropriated to distinguish two cases : before and after 0150 .",
    "the spreading of the values is indeed much larger in the first case than in the other ( see figure [ calib2 ] ) .",
    "this value of 0150 is certainly related to the size of the fwhm at these wavelengths ( @xmath0 2.4 pixels = 0110 ) .",
    "the 1@xmath7 uncertainty on the position angle before 0150 is 1.2 degree , and becomes only 0.3 degree after 0150 . as we could expect it ( for symmetry reasons ) , there is no perceptible dependency on the position angle ( except a slight change in the amplitude and period of the periodic pattern ) .",
    "the main variations are related to the difference of magnitude and of course to the separation .",
    "the systematic errors and uncertainties on the difference of magnitudes require a more detailed analysis and description .",
    "figure [ calib3 ] gives an overview of these results .",
    "the errors are very dependent on the difference of magnitude itself and of course on the separation , but are almost independent on the position angle ( only the period and amplitude of the periodic pattern depends slightly on the position angle , see above ) .",
    "again it is more appropriate to distinguish two different parts in the range of separation : before and after 0150 .",
    "the plots drawn in figure [ calib3 ] show also clearly that it is necessary to distinguish four different cases in the range of differences of magnitudes : @xmath8mag=0.00 ( hereafter case 1 ) , @xmath8mag=0.11 ( case 2 ) , 0.11@xmath9mag@xmath100.24 ( case 3 ) and 0.24@xmath9mag@xmath102.50 ( case 4 ) .",
    "cases 1 and 2 are the easiest to describe .",
    "the results are excellent after 0150 : the systematic errors and 1@xmath7 uncertainties are -0.01@xmath110.01 mag for the case 1 and 0.09@xmath110.02 mag for the case 2 . before 0150",
    "the errors can be precisely described by a 3rd order law with dispersions of only 0.05 mag in both cases .",
    "we will not linger over a more detailed description of these two cases since they do not describe any of our objects .",
    "the third and fourth cases are more difficult to analyse .    in the range of separation before 0150 , the systematic errors in the third case can be relatively precisely described by a 3rd order law with a dispersion of 0.07 mag . on the same range of separation , the fourth case is not reproduced as well as the other cases by a 3rd order law .",
    "nevertheless , the dispersion is 0.11 mag which is still reasonable . for the rest of our study",
    ", we will assimilate the systematic errors on these ranges of separation and differences of magnitude to the values given by the corresponding third order laws , and the 1@xmath7 uncertainties to the corresponding dispersions ( see table [ table_calib1 ] ) .",
    "in the range of separation after 0150 , the third case shows also an obvious periodic pattern due mostly to the shift by a fraction of a pixel and to the normalization .",
    "although it is obvious , this pattern can not be easily fitted by a sinusoidal function without underestimating the systematic error , mainly because of the many points that are far away from the pattern .",
    "we thus decide to assimilate the systematic error on these values to the average ( 0.17 mag ) and the 1@xmath7 uncertainties to the standard deviation ( @xmath110.07 mag ) .",
    "the pattern still appears but less obviously in the fourth case where the spreading of the errors is much larger . here",
    "also we assimilate the systematic error to the average of these values ( 0.20 mag ) and the 1@xmath7 uncertainties to their standard deviation ( @xmath110.09 mag ) .",
    "table [ table_calib1 ] and [ table_calib2 ] gives an overview of the conclusions of these calibrations .",
    "all the values given in the text and in the tables have been corrected for the systematic errors and the given uncertainties correspond to the 1@xmath7 uncertainties we calculated as explained in this section , unless specified explicitly .",
    "an overview of the results is given in table [ results ] and figure [ pa_vs_sep ] , and examples are given in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the uncertainties given in table [ results ] correspond to the 1@xmath7 uncertainties calculated as explained in the previous section .",
    "as the observations in the f814w filter offer a much better s / n than in the f675w and f1042 m filters , and a much better sampling than the f675w ( the diffraction limit is indeed 00703 in the f675w filter , and 00860 in the f814w filter , and the pixel scale of the wfpc2/pc camera is 00455 ) , we consider them more accurate .",
    "we therefore used only the values obtained with the f814w filter to compute the final parameters given in table [ results ] .",
    "for the data from the archive only the f814w and/or f1042 m filters are available ( the objects were too faint in the f606w filter ) .",
    "the psf at these wavelengths is under - sampled by the 00455 pix@xmath12 plate scale of the planetary camera , thus not allowing to use deconvolution in the fourier space . by using non - linear psf fitting",
    "as described above , we were able to push the limit of detection down to @xmath0 0060 arcsec for non - equal luminosity systems .",
    "figure [ calib1 ] shows that we should have been able to detect all the binary systems with differences of magnitudes between @xmath13 mag easily even in the faintest cases , and binary systems with differences of magnitudes between @xmath14 mag in the brightest cases .    in the next section",
    "we will comment on the results for each object .",
    "an overview of values of photometry , spectral types , and distances for all the targets of the sample is given in tables [ targets ] , [ photom_go8720],[photom_go8581 ] and [ photom_go8146 ] .",
    "the i , j , k@xmath15 values of the denis objects come from the denis survey .",
    "the j , h , k@xmath15 values of the 2mass and some sdss objects come from the 2mass survey @xcite and from davy kirkpatrick s on - line archive of l and t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the i values of the 2mass and sdss targets have been calculated as follow : using the f675w and f814w magnitudes obtained in the data ( see section [ colours ] ) and the i magnitudes of the denis objects of our program ( see table [ targets ] ) , we derived the following relation : @xmath16 with a dispersion of 0.18 mag ( thus of the same order than the uncertainties on the denis magnitudes themselves ) and used it to compute the i magnitudes is very close to the i@xmath17 @xcite ] given in table [ targets ] .",
    "the magnitudes have been measured with standard procedures using the aperture photometry task _ phot _ in iraf , using sky subtraction and a 3@xmath7 rejection .",
    "we used a recommended aperture of 05 in the case of unresolved objects , and an aperture of 1365 ( 30 pixels ) in the case of binaries , to measure the total flux of the system .",
    "the counts were transformed to magnitudes using the relation : @xmath18=-2.5 \\cdot log(counts / exp)+zp-0.1 $ ] for the unresolved objects , where @xmath19 is the number of counts measured with iraf , @xmath20 the exposure time , @xmath21 the vega zero point magnitude ( @xmath22 mag , @xmath23 mag , and @xmath24 mag , @xcite ) and @xmath25 is to correct from the finite to infinite aperture , according to the hst data handbook , and the relation : @xmath18=-2.5 \\cdot log(counts / exp)+zp-0.028 $ ] in the case of binaries , where @xmath26 is the correction we evaluated as suggested in the hst data handbook to correct from the finite to infinite aperture in that case . for multiple systems , we deduced the magnitude of each component using our values of flux ratios . in many cases we just had one image thus not allowing to remove cosmic ray events automatically .",
    "nevertheless cosmic rays should not have influenced our photometry significantly since we would have been able to detect any cosmic ray event too close to the object to be removed by the 3@xmath7 automatic rejection .",
    "this situation happened in only one case ( 2massw2147 + 1431 , f1042 m filter ) .",
    "all the cosmic ray events sufficiently far away from the object have been corrected by the 3@xmath7 automatic rejection of the iraf _ phot _ task .",
    "the results are given in tables [ results ] , [ photom_go8720 ] , [ photom_go8581 ] and [ photom_go8146 ] .",
    "uncertainties for the unresolved objects are 0.1 mag .    a few denis objects and most 2mass and sdss objects had accurate values of spectral types found in davy kirkpatrick s on - line archive of l and t dwarfs @xcite , and obtained through spectroscopic measurements . for the other objects",
    ", we used the @xcite spectral type vs. ( i - j ) colour relation to deduce the spectral types given in table [ targets ] .",
    "these latter spectral types will have to be confirmed by spectroscopic measurements .",
    "the sample thus covers a large range of spectral types , going from @xmath0m8 to @xmath0l8 .",
    "two efforts by the united states naval observatory and by an australian group led by chris tinney are currently under way in order to derive precise angular parallaxes for these objects .",
    "some of the targets already have published angular parallaxes and distances @xcite . for the unresolved objects without published trigonometric parallax",
    ", we evaluated the photometric parallax using the @xcite m@xmath27 vs. spectral type relation when both j and spectral type where available , and the @xcite m@xmath27 vs. ( i - j ) relation in the other cases .",
    "for the multiple systems , we evaluated the distance using the @xcite m@xmath28 vs. spectral type relation and then multiplied the photometric distance obtained by a correction factor of @xmath29 , were @xmath30 is the flux ratio ( in the f814w@xmath0i@xmath31 filter ) , to correct for the bias introduced by the multiplicity .",
    "these results indicate that the ultra - cool dwarfs in the sample are at distances between 7pc and 105pc ( cf .",
    "table [ targets ] ) .",
    "some sdss objects had no published values of spectral types and j , h , k@xmath32 magnitudes , thus not allowing to evaluate their photometric distances .",
    "for these objects we assumed a typical distance of 20 pc .      is a l7v brown dwarf in the kirkpatrick classification scheme ( l5 in the martn classification scheme ) .",
    "it has been discovered by @xcite , and announced as a binary by @xcite , on the basis of k band observations at keck ( 051@xmath11002 and 106@xmath335@xmath34 in july 1997 , and 051@xmath11002 and 72@xmath3310@xmath34 in january 1999 ) .",
    "this object has also been observed in the 2mass survey and is reported as .",
    "@xcite observed it in the ir with ukirt on september 1999 , and report a separation of 035 @xmath11003 and a position angle of 77@xmath334@xmath34 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite report the detection of methane absorption band in their ir spectra , which would imply a mass below the stellar limit , and an effective temperature below 1800k , as stated by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated this temperature to be @xmath35 k. @xcite also observed absorption feature in the spectra but attributed it to h@xmath36 rather than ch@xmath37 .",
    "an overview of interesting values currently known about is given in table [ table_d1228_d0205 ] .",
    "on this particular object we had two sets of data , one coming from our hst / go8720 program and one coming from the hst / go9157 program .",
    "the first set of data ( go8720 ) included two filter images .",
    "the agreement between the values obtained in each filter is not as good as for the other objects ( cf .",
    "figure [ pa_vs_sep ] ) .",
    "we measured a separation of @xmath38 mas in the f675w filter and @xmath39 mas in the f814w filter .",
    "the discrepancy comes probably from the fact that the secondary is very elongated on both images .",
    "the object fell on a boundary between two pixels and its psf is spread over two pixels , increasing the uncertainties .",
    "as the f814w image is more sensitive than the f675w one , and as the secondary is brighter ( and thus easier to detect ) in the f814w filter , we consider hereafter the corresponding value to be the best one .",
    "we measured differences of magnitudes of @xmath40 mag and @xmath41 mag , but these values could be altered by the fact that the psf of the secondary is elongated .",
    "the second set of data ( go9157 ) was better and more accurate values were obtained .",
    "several exposures were available , thus allowing to reject cosmic rays .",
    "we measured a separation of @xmath42 mas and a position angle of @xmath43 degrees .",
    "the difference of magnitude is @xmath44 mag and is in good agreement with the previous one , suggesting that even if the psf of the secondary was elongated , the value was not altered too much .",
    "both @xcite report a difference of magnitude of about 0 mag in the ir .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows clearly that this is not the case in the f814w filter .",

    ", they measured a separation of @xmath202 mas and a position angle of @xmath203 degrees .",
    "they estimated an age of @xmath204 gyr and a photometric distance of @xmath205 pc , thus giving a separation of @xmath206 a.u and a period of @xmath207 years .",
    "they also estimated the mass of the whole system @xmath208 @xmath101 as well as the masses of each components : @xmath209 @xmath101 for the primary and @xmath210 @xmath101 for the secondary , thus clearly below the sub - stellar limit . from their colours",
    "they estimated the spectral types of each component : m@xmath197 for the primary and l@xmath211 for the secondary .",
    "this object is very peculiar because the differences of magnitudes between the primary and the secondary are really high in the infrared . @xcite",
    "measured @xmath212 mag .",
    "we used data from the hst public archive ( go8581 , p.i reid ) .",
    "the object was observed on the 6th of may 2001 , in the pc chip of wfpc2 in two filters ( f814w and f1042 m ) , almost 4.5 months before @xcite reported it . on this set of data",
    "we measure a separation of @xmath213 mas and a position angle of @xmath214 degrees , as well as difference of magnitude of @xmath215 mag , and @xmath216 mag .",
    "the results we obtain in the two filters are slightly different but still in agreement within 3@xmath7 ( cf .",
    "table [ results ] ) .",
    "our value for the separation is in good agreement with the values given by @xcite but the difference in the values for the position angle is larger .",
    "even if the difference of magnitude is high , the separation is large enough to let us trust the results we obtained with our psf fitting method with the accuracy of 00028 for the separation and 0.3@xmath34 for the p.a , as explained in section [ dataanalysis ] .",
    "@xcite measured a proper motion of @xmath1830401/yr and @xmath184 - 0231/yr , implying a motion of 0150 in right ascension and -0087 in declination between the observations , whereas the variation of position angle occurs in the opposite direction , confirming that the system is a common proper motion pair .",
    "on the basis of distance and proper motions consistencies , @xcite suggested that 2massw2331016 - 040618 is associated to the f8 dwarf .",
    "the distance ( 26.2 pc ) and proper motion ( @xmath217 mas / yr and @xmath218 mas / yr ) of hd221356 have been measured precisely by hipparcos .",
    "the distances of the two objects are very similar ( 26.2 pc for the m - dwarf and 26.24 for the f - dwarf ) but the proper motions measured by @xcite and hipparcos @xcite are very different : more than 220 mas / yr of difference for @xmath219 and almost 40 mas / yr for @xmath220 .",
    "we then suggest that these two objects are not linked on the basis of proper motion discrepancy .",
    "hd221356 does not appear on the hst images we used , thus not allowing to check for second epoch data .",
    "it might nevertheless be interesting to get second epoch data in the future to confirm the values of proper motion of 2massw2331016 - 040618 given by @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider that 2massw2331016 - 040618 is a field binary ultra - cool dwarf .",
    "we estimate a photometric distance corrected for the binarity of 26.2 pc . considering a semi - major axis of 19.0 a.u , and a total mass of 0.153 @xmath101 ,",
    "the period of this system would be 211 years .",
    "is a new very close binary system candidate .",
    "we measured a separation of @xmath221 mas and a position angle of @xmath222 degrees .",
    "the system is so close that it was not resolved in the f1042 m filter .",
    "we are here very close to the hst / wfpc2 pixel scale and already below the sampling limit , thus second epoch data with higher resolution will be necessary in order to confirm the multiplicity of this object .",
    "the difference of magnitude in the f814w is : @xmath223 mag .",
    "this value should be considered with caution , since we reach here the limits of resolution of hst / wfpc2 .",
    "it might thus be better to consider 2- or 3-@xmath7 uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless the clear elongation of the object in the image as well as the companion that appears clearly after psf fitting as shown in figure [ close_bin ] allow us to conclude that sdss2335583 - 001304 is a good candidate multiple system .",
    "unfortunately the only photometric value available is the one we measured , thus not allowing to compute the photometric distance .    assuming a circular face - on orbit at a distance of 20 pc , with a total mass of @xmath53 m@xmath46 ( masses are here unknown and we assume masses of about @xmath0 0.1 m@xmath46 for each component ) , and a radius of 1.4 a.u , the period of this system would be @xmath0 3.7 years only . at a distance of 40",
    "pc , this period would be 10.9 years .",
    "this makes of sdss2335583 - 001304 one of the best candidates for a direct estimate of dynamical masses within a few years only .",
    "26 of the 134 targets in the sample appear to be multiple systems ( see figure [ all_bin ] ) .",
    "fifteen of these still have to be confirmed by second epoch data , but given the relatively low star density , we will consider that these objects are almost certainly binary systems .",
    "2massw1112256 + 354813 is associated to a g - dwarf in a triple system , and thus is not a field binary and we therefore remove it from the statistics .",
    "we then hereafter count 25 field binaries .",
    "eleven binary systems were already known and thus confirmed by second and sometimes third epoch data .",
    "our observed binary frequency is based on the fact that we know 25 binaries in a sample of 133 ultra - cool dwarfs .",
    "this corresponds to an observed binary fraction of @xmath224 .",
    "this value is only indicative and not related to any physical value for the following reasons :    * first because our detection was limited to binaries with differences of magnitude @xmath225 less than 3 mag ( 5.5 mag in the best cases , @xmath04 mag in average , cf .",
    "figure [ calib1 ] ) .",
    "we thus missed all the multiple systems for which the companion was too faint in comparison with the primary .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in figures [ calib1 ] and [ distri_dmag ] and as explained in section [ lum_ratio ] , our observations suggest a strong preference for nearly equal luminosity systems .",
    "we therefore go on the assumption that multiple systems with high differences of magnitudes are rare among ultra - cool dwarfs and that we do not miss a significant number of such multiple systems in our study except if there is a bimodal distribution of mass ratio with a second peak at small mass ratio . *",
    "second because the sample selection introduced a bias , since we did not choose the targets completely randomly among field brown dwarfs : some were selected from their colours and brightnesses .",
    "the sample is thus limited in magnitudes rather than in distances , and this introduces a bias : the multiple systems are detected at larger distances than simple one , and their spatial density is thus overestimated . to be able to evaluate more precisely the binary fraction we have been analysing the sample in order to find at which limiting distance the sample can not be considered as a complete volume - limited sample . as the sample is made of objects coming from different surveys ( denis , 2mass ans sdss ) , we had to take their respective limits of completeness in account .",
    "the denis survey is complete until objects with i@xmath22618 mag @xcite . for a typical ultra - cool dwarf of spectral type l5 ( latest denis spectral type of the sample , except denis0205 - 1159 )",
    ", it corresponds to an absolute magnitude of m@xmath227 17 mag ( according to the m@xmath28 vs. spectral type relation given in @xcite ) , and to a distance of @xmath0 16 pc .",
    "we consider for our study that the 2mass survey has a limit of completeness of k@xmath22614.5 mag . for a typical ultra - cool dwarf of spectral type l8",
    ", this corresponds to an absolute magnitude m@xmath22813 mag , and to a distance of @xmath020 pc .",
    "we can therefore as a first approximation consider that the sample was very close to a volume limited sample until 16 pc for the denis objects and until 20 pc for the 2mass objects .",
    "as the sdss objects represent only a very small number of objects in the sample , as many of them were also observed in the 2mass survey and as they are all further away than 20 pc , they do not count in the statistical study hereafter .",
    "figure [ distances ] shows that on the range 0@xmath020 pc ( distance corrected for the resolved multiple systems ) , the sample behaves almost like a volume limited sample and the number of objects increases like @xmath229 . + after 20 pc , the sample behaves indeed more like a magnitude limited sample and the number of objects decreases roughly like @xmath230 .",
    "all these considerations suggest to us that in order to make a better statistical study , we should consider only the denis objects of the sample that are closer than 16 pc and the 2mass objects that are closer than 20 pc .",
    "only one denis object ( no binary ) and twenty five 2mass objects ( including four multiple systems ) are thus included in the statistical sample defined as explained above .",
    "this makes a binary fraction of @xmath231 . * finally because the detections are limited to objects with separations greater than @xmath0 0.060 arcsec .",
    "we therefore missed all the binaries with separations less than this value .",
    "this effect becomes stronger with increasing distances . at a distance of 20 pc",
    ", it corresponds to physical separations of 1.2 a.u .",
    "the value given above is then probably a lower limit of the exact binary fraction .",
    "another way to estimate the bias corrected binary frequency is to apply a correction to the observed binary frequency as described in @xcite ( see their equations 4 and 5 ) . if we go on the assumption that the total sample is purely magnitude limited , and that the correction factor for the increase of volume sampled for binaries is between @xmath232 ( see section [ lum_ratio ] ) , the corrected binary fraction is @xmath233 .",
    "as we observe a preference for nearly equal luminosity systems ( see section [ lum_ratio ] ) , @xmath234 must be closer to 2.83 than to 1.86 .",
    "the value given above therefore corresponds to @xmath2352.83 , but its uncertainties includes the uncertainties on @xmath234 and on the observed binary fraction .",
    "this result is of the same order than the previous one and in good agreement within the uncertainties .",
    "however , the two methods presented here to correct the observed binary frequency take in account only the bias for visual binaries resolved by hst , and not for the spectroscopic binaries of the sample that we miss . indeed in order to construct our `` volume limited '' sample we correct the photometric distances of the identified hst visual binaries , but not those of undetected spectroscopic binaries .",
    "the same is true for the @xcite method ; in their equation 4 , only the volume sampled for hst visual binaries is corrected . as result , the denominator of the binary fraction , which is the total number of systems ( single and multiple ) , is overestimated because the bias for multiplicity is not corrected for all the multiple systems , and the binary fraction is therefore under - estimated .",
    "nevertheless , this sample of 134 objects is the largest studied to date , with the highest spatial resolution available .",
    "we found 15 new binary candidates ( to be added to the 11 previously known ) .",
    "this allows us to make a meaningful statistical study over a sufficiently large number of objects .",
    "although it is biased , we can already make some preliminary comments on the results , keeping in mind the limitations of this study .    with these considerations",
    "we obtain a hst visual binary fraction among ultra - cool dwarfs of @xmath236 .",
    "but even in these conditions and with these precautions the sample is not a purely volume limited sample and the results will not be as accurate as the one we could get with a statistically well defined sample .      figure [ distri_sep ] shows the distribution of separations .",
    "it shows evidence of a lack of binaries with separations wider than @xmath237 a.u .",
    "this was already mentioned as the possible `` brown dwarf wide binary desert '' by @xcite .",
    "this is certainly not an artifact of incompleteness in the observations since this separation corresponds to @xmath0 05 ( at an average distance of @xmath238 pc ) , where multiple systems can easily be detected either by hst / wfpc2 for the faintest companions or 2mass and denis in the brighter and wider cases ( the resolutions of the 2mass and denis surveys are @xmath0 20 , corresponding to @xmath239 a.u semi - major axis at 20 pc ) .",
    "figure [ distri_sep ] shows clearly that all the objects have angular separations well below these limits .",
    "we estimate that we should have been able to detect every companion candidate within 40 of the targets ( within the limits of flux ratio mentioned in section [ lum_ratio ] ) .",
    "we have been looking for wide companions by comparing the colours of the objects in the wfpc2 field of view , and found only very few candidates with colours very similar to those of the associated targets . the colours similarity being a poor constraint ( especially with the hst filters used in this study ) ,",
    "the probability that these objects are physically associated to the corresponding targets is very low .",
    "one object from the literature ( cfht - pl-18 , cf .",
    "table [ table_periods ] ) is currently known to have a wider separation ( 35 a.u ) , but even in this case the separation does not exceed a few tens of a.u .",
    "this indicates that these objects can exist but are probably very rare , and probably do not have separations greater than a few tens of a.u .",
    "figure [ calib1 ] and [ distri_dmag ] also suggest that there is a lack of binary systems with large differences of magnitudes , corresponding to unequal luminosities .",
    "most of the values of differences of magnitudes are homogeneously spread between @xmath240 mag .",
    "only two systems have @xmath241 mag . as explained in section [ dataanalysis ] , this is probably not an artifact of incompleteness , because even if the sample is magnitude limited ( in a magnitude limited sample , the selection bias is stronger for the equal luminosity systems , since the systems with unequal luminosities are detected in a smaller volume ) figure [ distri_dmag ] shows that we should have been able to detect all the binary systems with differences of magnitudes between @xmath13 mag easily even in the faintest cases , and binary systems with differences of magnitudes between @xmath14 mag in the brightest cases .",
    "binaries with a flux ratio @xmath242 can be detected @xmath29 times further away .",
    "therefore the higher ( @xmath0 1 ) the flux ratio is , the larger the sampled volume is .",
    "this is an another well known effect of the bias introduced by the multiplicity : the number of equal mass binaries is over - estimated in comparison with the number of binaries with large differences of magnitudes .",
    "this effect is maximum for equal mass binaries compared to binaries with mass ratio close to zero .",
    "the volume sampled for equal mass binaries is then 2.83 times larger than the volume sampled for systems with mass ratio close to zero . in our study",
    "we find a factor of @xmath243 times more systems with @xmath240 mag than system with @xmath244 ( see figure [ distri_dmag ] ) .",
    "such a very large ratio can not be explained by this bias .",
    "a colour - magnitude diagram ( f814w vs. ( f675w - f814w ) @xmath0 i vs. r - i ) of the sample of the go8720 program is given in figure [ iri ] .",
    "plotted are the single or unresolved targets , as well as the multiple systems represented by three points : one point for the whole system and two linked points for the two individual components .",
    "figure [ iri ] shows clearly that the multiple systems include some of the reddest objects of the sample .",
    "the slopes of the lines joining the primary and the secondary might indicate that for two objects the secondary is bluer ( higher r - i ) , whereas for the three other it is redder .",
    "this might be explained by dust effects as described in the dusty model @xcite , but could also be due to the relatively high uncertainties on the flux ratios and the corresponding uncertainties on the magnitudes of the two components .",
    "a colour - magnitude diagram ( f814w vs. ( f814w - f1042 m ) @xmath0 i vs. i - z ) of the sample of the go8581 program is given in figure [ izi ] .",
    "not all the 15 binaries found in this sample were bright enough in the f1042 m filter to be able to do the psf fitting , thus not allowing to measure the flux ratios .",
    "this study allows us to point out three important results : the frequency of binaries , the lack of binaries with separations greater than 15 a.u and the possible preference for equal - mass systems .",
    "we will now discuss these results in the context of current scenarios of formation and evolution of free - floating ultra - cool dwarfs .",
    "the value we found for the binary frequency ( 10@xmath015% ) is much lower than the values given by @xcite for g dwarfs ( @xmath245 ) , and by @xcite or @xcite for the early m dwarfs ( @xmath246 ) considering that this latter values covers larger ranges of mass ratios and separations whereas we were limited in both cases .",
    "if we compare with only the g and m stellar systems having a separation @xmath247 a.u ( corresponding to respectively 0060 and 40 at the average distance of our sample : 35 pc ) we find roughly @xmath248 in the @xcite distribution , which is still much higher than the one we give here for ultracool dwarfs ( spectral types between m7 and l8 ) . for comparison , in figure [ histo ]",
    "we combine a plot of the 25 field binary ultracool dwarfs presented here , with the distribution of separations given by @xcite for the g - dwarfs . in the left part of our histogram we missed the binaries with separations smaller than @xmath0 0060 .",
    "even if it is not correct to compare directly both distributions ( the @xcite distribution was indeed corrected for biases whereas the distribution of the 25 binaries is not corrected at all ) , we can note the absence of systems with separations greater than @xmath55 a.u , and the strong peak between @xmath249 a.u , instead of @xmath250 a.u for the g dwarfs .    in a recent study @xcite report an observed binary frequency among t dwarfs of @xmath251 ( 2 multiple systems over a sample of 20 objects ) corresponding to a biased corrected fraction of @xmath252 .",
    "this number is in good agreement with the one we report here for late - m and l dwarfs .",
    "they also computed a bias corrected value of the binary fraction of late - m and l dwarfs of the sample of @xcite ( hst program go8146 , 4 multiple objects among 20 targets ) and , assuming it was a purely magnitude limited sample , they estimated a fraction of binary of the same order ( @xmath253 ) ( see section [ bin_freq ] for a detailed discussion on the difficulty to correct properly the bias ) .",
    "the results are again in good agreement within @xmath254 .",
    "our binary fraction is based on a total sample 6.65 larger than the samples of t - dwarfs and l - dwarfs they present , including the sample of l - dwarfs of @xcite .",
    "the binary frequency we report here gives also strong constraints on the models of formation .",
    "in particular such a high rate of multiple systems can not be explained by the models of ejection @xcite that predict very few binary ultra - cool dwarfs . in a recent study @xcite report",
    "that their models of formation and evolution predict a very low frequency of binaries among very low mass stars and brown dwarfs ( @xmath255 ) , because in most of the cases the dynamical interactions involved in the ejection of the ultracool dwarfs lead to the disruption of the multiple systems .",
    "their important results obtained using high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations of 5 bodies star forming regions @xcite and star formation from the fragmentation of turbulent molecular clouds @xcite are thus in contradiction with the results we present here on that point .",
    "indeed , even if the binary frequency we report here is not much higher than the upper limit predicted by these models , we have to keep in mind that our value is a lower limit since we did not take in account the spectroscopic binaries .",
    "our binary frequency is also in contradiction with the few - body decay models @xcite which predict that almost all brown dwarf binaries are broken by gravitational interactions if they originate from bound clusters of moderate sizes .",
    "the binary frequency we present here should allow to constrain better the properties of the initial molecular clouds in which ultra - cool dwarfs are supposed to form .",
    "the lack of binaries with wide separations that we observe for ultra - cool and brown dwarfs suggest that there are major differences in the formation and evolution processes of these ultra - cool objects in comparison with stars . whereas they can not explain the binary frequency we report here , the models of ejection @xcite are consistent with the wide binary desert .",
    "only a close binary might indeed be able to survive during the disruption process .",
    "as we observe a relatively high rate of binaries , it is more likely that the observed desert might be the consequence of several effects : both formation peculiarities and later evolution processes , such as disruption due to the gravitational interaction with neighbouring stars and/or molecular clouds ( see @xcite for a discussion on this last point ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the previous results presented by @xcite .",
    "the transformation of flux ratio to mass ratio is not straightforward , because the ages of various individual systems can be very different , and second because of the degeneracy in the mass - luminosity ( age - temperature ) relation in the case of brown dwarfs .",
    "luminosities and effective temperatures of brown dwarfs are indeed function of both age and mass @xcite .",
    "but since the two components of a binary system can be assumed to be coeval , a difference in the luminosity must be associated to a difference in mass .    as we observe a strong lack of binaries between @xmath256 mag ( see fig .",
    "[ distri_dmag ] ) , and if we consider that the sample covers a randomly large range of ages ( typically between 0.5 gyr and 10 gyrs ) , we can suggest that this might be evidence of a preference for equal - mass systems , as it was thought before .",
    "indeed table [ model ] shows that the mass ratios corresponding to @xmath257 mag for ages between 0.5 gyr and 5.0 gyrs are ranging between 75@xmath258 and 95@xmath258 , whereas mass ratios corresponding to @xmath259 mag are ranging between 55@xmath258 and 74@xmath258 @xcite .",
    "if we consider a coeval binary system with a primary with @xmath260k , 1gyr and m@xmath261=0.07m@xmath46 , a difference of magnitude @xmath262 mag corresponds to a secondary with @xmath263k and m@xmath264=0.06m@xmath46 , whereas a a difference of magnitude @xmath265 mag corresponds to a secondary with @xmath266k and m@xmath264=0.052m@xmath46 .",
    "these examples illustrates the limits we were able to reach in our study .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that this lack is similar to the deficiency of low mass ratios among binary early - m dwarfs in comparison with g dwarfs reported by @xcite and to the excess of near equal mass m - dwarf binary systems in comparison with g dwarfs systems reported by @xcite .",
    "all these observations suggest different formation mechanisms and/or different processes of evolution .",
    "the survey is of course biased by the limited sensitivity at smaller separations / lower flux ratios , but nevertheless covers a relatively large dynamic and resolution range . because of these limits of detection we can not exclude the possibility of a multi - modal distribution of mass ratio , even if this scenario appears very unlikely in the current context of models of formation and evolution .",
    "it is important to remember that we were not able to detect systems with @xmath225 greater than 5.5 mag , corresponding to systems with mass ratios of about 45@xmath258 , 61@xmath258 , 71@xmath258 respectively at the ages of 0.5 , 1.0 and 5 gyrs and for a primary mass of 0.1m@xmath46 ( according to the dusty models of @xcite , cf .",

    "this paper has been first submitted in august 2002 , but its publication has been delayed untill september 2003 . due to this long delay ,",
    "several other relevant referenced results have been published since the time of submission .",
    "we have reviewed the results of high spatial resolution observations of 134 late m- and l - dwarfs in the field .",
    "26 of them are resolved binaries , with separations between 0.06 and 0.6 arcsec , but one is associated to a star in a triple system .",
    "eleven of the binaries were already known to be multiple systems .",
    "our sample , added to hst data from the archive , makes a sample of 134 objects .",
    "the results of these combined observations indicate an binary fraction of @xmath233 ( after correction of the bias ) among field ultracool dwarfs with distances less than 25 pc , with all separations below 15 a.u . considering",
    "that our bias correction is over - estimated , the true hst visual binary fraction should be around 10% .",
    "new statistical studies on better defined samples are necessary to confirm these values .",
    "the distribution of flux ratios might be an indication that ultracool dwarf binaries form in nearly equal mass systems ( @xmath267m2/m1@xmath268 ) rather than over the entire range of mass ratios .",
    "if confirmed by better statistical studies , these results would be very promising for the future studies : measuring masses of binaries should allow to get the missing constraints for the theoretical models of formation and evolution .",
    "studying the coeval components of multiple systems should allow to calibrate the important mass - luminosity ( age - temperature ) relation , but also help to ascertain the formation mechanisms .",
    "more observations of multiple systems and second and third epoch data will be required in order to constrain the theoretical models and improve our knowledge of very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
