    "the optical spectra of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars feature broad emission lines from highly - ionized elements .",
    "these emission lines arise in a fast , hot , and dense stellar wind which is generally optically thick in the inner part , thereby completely veiling the hydrostatic photosphere of the wr star . depending on the elements they show in their optical spectra ,",
    "wr stars are classified into three different subtypes .",
    "if a wr star displays predominantly helium ( he ) and nitrogen ( n ) , which are formed during hydrogen burning via the cno cycle , the star is classified as wn ; if the wr star displays , in addition to he , predominantly carbon ( c ) or oxygen ( o ) , which are the products of @xmath1 he burning , it is classified as wc or wo .    due to their chemical properties ,",
    "it is now generally accepted that classical wr stars are evolved objects , namely the almost bare , hydrogen - depleted , helium - burning cores of stars whose initial mass on the main sequence ( ms ) was , at solar metallicity , above @xmath2 , i.e. that started their lives as o stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the key question of wr - star formation is how a wr - star progenitor loses its outer , h - rich envelope to expose the cno - enriched , deeper layers , and how wr - star formation depends on ambient metallicity . for single stars ,",
    "three scenarios have been put forward , depending on the initial mass of the star .",
    "stars with initial masses @xmath3 are expected to become red supergiants ( rsgs ) , as which they experience continuous mass loss through winds .",
    "stars with initial masses @xmath4 are believed to turn into luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) , as which they experience outbursts of violent , eruptive shell - ejections ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "stars with even higher initial masses ( @xmath5 at solar metallicity ) are believed to reach the wn phase while they are still core - hydrogen burning , and to _ directly _ evolve into classical , he - burning wr stars ( @xcite ) without going through the lbv phase .    in close binaries ,",
    "roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) is suspected to enhance wr - star formation by removing the h - rich envelope of the ( more evolved ) primary ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite was the first to note that a thus stripped he - burning core would very likely resemble a wr star .",
    "since rsgs descend from the initially least massive o stars ( see above ) , it follows that rlof might thus considerably contribute to the total wr numbers , in particular in low - metallicity environments , where radiatively - driven mass - loss rates are expected to be very low ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) . indeed , older , non - rotating stellar - evolution models were unable to reproduce the",
    "observed wr populations at different @xmath6 without either enhancing by a factor of two the then - higher mass - loss rates through stellar winds or increasing the fraction of interacting binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "while updated models now include stellar rotation , and much better reproduce the observations without the need of increased binary interaction ( @xcite ) , the influence of binarity on wr - star formation remains unclear .    from model calculations , @xcite found that close o+o binaries with initial periods @xmath7 d can not escape rlof if the primary star reaches the rsg stage , resulting in wr+o binaries with post - rlof periods @xmath8d ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , in environments where rlof is expected to become the increasingly important wr - star formation channel ( i.e. at lower ambient @xmath6 ) , the fraction of wr binaries with present - day periods of up to 200 days should be higher .",
    "this prediction is accessible to observational tests .",
    "for such a study , the magellanic clouds are the ideal laboratory : @xmath9 ) the distances to both the smc and the lmc are well established and @xmath10 constant for all stars ( e.g. @xcite ) ; @xmath11 ) reddening towards the clouds is low and fairly constant , contrary to the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath12 ) the wr populations in both clouds are nearly complete ( e.g. @xcite , but see @xcite ) , @xmath13 ) the wr population is large enough to allow for reasonable statistics . in total , the lmc harbours 132 wr stars ( @xcite , hereafter bat99 ) , while 12 wr stars are known in the smc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . to search for binaries ,",
    "the total sample of 144 stars has been split into three distinct studies : @xcite reported the results on the 25 magellanic cloud wc / wo stars , while foellmi et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) studied the 71 then - known , early - type wne ( = wn2-wn5 ) stars , with the exception of the h - rich wne stars in and around the r136 cluster in the 30 dor region .",
    "the observations of a 72nd wne star , which was newly discovered by @xcite in the smc , were reported by @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we describe our intense , spectroscopic survey of the remaining 41 , late - type wnl ( = wn5 - 11 ) stars in the lmc .",
    "the two wn6 stars in the smc were already studied by @xcite .",
    "our survey includes those wnl stars in the periphery of r136 which could be observed with ground - based telescopes without adaptive optics ( ao ) . for the 6 luminous , wn5 - 7 ha stars in the very core of r136 ,",
    "ao - assisted , near - infrared spectroscopy using vlt / sinfoni was used ; those results will be reported elsewhere ( schnurr et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the aim of our study is manifold . first and foremost , we will assess the binary status ( @xmath0 days ) of each of our 41 program stars .",
    "this will conclude the decade - long effort of the montral massive star group to study spectroscopically the entire wr population in the magellanic clouds , and pave the way to obtain a much clearer view of the role binarity plays in the evolution of massive stars at different metallicities .",
    "secondly , binaries identified in this study can be used , in the future , to determine their respective masses by using model - independent , keplerian orbits .",
    "masses of wr stars are of greatest importance in the context of the calibration of both atmospheric and evolutionary models , in particular for the most massive stars .",
    "we have ample reason to believe that at least some h - rich wnl stars in our sample belong to the subgroup of very massive , possibly even the most massive stars known in the local group ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . thirdly and as a side effect , we will be able to put publicly available , archival x - ray data from _ chandra _ and _ rosat _ into context with the binary status of our stars , since massive binaries with colliding stellar winds are known to be strong x - ray emitters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ wnlsection2 ] , we will describe the observations of our program stars . in section [ wnlsection3 ]",
    ", we will briefly describe the data reduction . in section [ wnlsection4 ] , we will describe in detail how we analysed our spectroscopic and x - ray data and the results we obtained .",
    "these results will be discussed in section [ wnlsection5 ] .",
    "section [ wnlsection6 ] summarizes and concludes this paper .",
    "target stars were selected from _ the fourth catalogue of population i wolf - rayet stars in the large magellanic cloud _ ( bat99 )",
    ". this catalogue lists 134 wr stars of which 47 fall into the wnl (= wn6 - 11 ) class , including the two `` slash - star '' types o3if / wn6 ( supposedly h - burning ; @xcite ) and ofpe / wn9 ( supposedly linked to the lbv phenomenon ; see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "41 of these 47 stars ( see table [ targets ] ) were observed with conventional spectrographs , and the results of those observations are reported here .",
    ".list of our program stars as taken from the bat99 catalogue .",
    "bat99 numbers as well as cross - identification with the brey , radcliffe and/or melnick numbers are given , together with @xmath14 magnitudes and spectral types , according to bat99 .",
    "stars without a brey denomination are those that have been newly included into the bat99 catalogue . [ cols=\"<,^,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have carried out spectroscopic monitoring of all 41 wnl stars in the lmc that could be observed by conventional , ground - based observations .",
    "measured rv curves were used to identify binaries with orbital periods from 1 to @xmath15 days , because these systems were expected to be post - rlof candidates ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , publicly available archive data from x - ray satellite missions were searched for our program stars to obtain x - ray luminosities .",
    "the results of our study can be summarized as follows ( see also table [ binaries ] ) :    * we have identified four previously unknown binary systems : bat99 - 12 , 95 , 99 , and 113 . * we confirmed the previously known binaries bat99 - 32 , 77 , 92 . however , while we could reproduce the 2.76-day period that @xcite had reported for star bat99 - 102 , we did so for star bat99 - 103 .",
    "it presently remains unknown whether @xcite or we wrongly identified the binary .",
    "* we also confirmed that bat99 - 119 is a binary ; however , we had to combine our rv data with those of @xcite to do so , and it required further combination with previously unpublished polarimetry to identify the 159-day period of the system . for reasons of completeness , we list the results here , but the complete study will be published elsewhere ( schnurr et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "* one star , bat99 - 107 , had been suspected binary by @xcite , but we were unable to reproduced that results .",
    "therefore , we consider 105 to be single ( i.e. , not a binary with an orbital period in the quoted range ) .",
    "* two binary candidates were identified from their rv variability and their x - ray luminosities , bat99 - 116 and 118 . both systems merit a closer look , because 116 is one of the brightest x - ray sources among all wr stars , while 118 is the most luminous wr star and thus , the most luminous unevolved star known in the local group ( cf .",
    "* one of our program stars , bat99 - 92 , a binary , was recognized to be a wne and not a wnl star . *",
    "thus , our study brings the total number of known wnl binaries to 8 , and the binary frequency among wnl stars in the lmc to 20% , which is fully consistent with the results for wc / wo stars ( @xcite ) and wne stars ( @xcite ) ; thus , there is no statisticially significant differences between different wr populations in the lmc .",
    "however , the overall binary frequency is only half of what was predicted from model results by @xcite .",
    "the implications of this low binary frequency for massive - star evolution will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "remarkably , none of the wnl binaries contains a classical , hydrogen - deficient , helium - burning wr star ; instead , the wn components are young , unevolved , objects ( hot o3if / wn6 stars or more extreme wn5 - 7 ha stars ) , which most likely are very luminous and hence very massive of stars , and possibly even the most massive stars known .",
    "these binaries offer the tremendous opportunity to directly weigh these extreme stars using model - independent , keplerian orbits .",
    "follow - up observations have partly been obtained and are currently reduced , or are under way .",
    "the results of these observations will be published elsewhere .",
