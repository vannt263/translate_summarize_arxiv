    "in the past there has been considerable effort to explore the structure of @xmath0n , while there is fewer report for its mirror analog @xmath0f since it can be investigated through relatively few reactions including @xmath4n(@xmath5he,@xmath6)@xmath0f @xcite , @xmath0o(@xmath7,@xmath6)@xmath0f @xcite , @xmath0o(@xmath5he,@xmath8)@xmath0f @xcite , and @xmath9f(@xmath10he,@xmath3he)@xmath0f @xcite . the level diagram for the four low - lying states in mirror pair of @xmath0n-@xmath0f",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "all the states in @xmath0f are unbound and decay as @xmath1o+@xmath7 .",
    "the measurements using stable beams have well determined spin - parity values and excitation energies with an accuracy of 4 - 6 kev for the four low - lying states in @xmath0f @xcite .",
    "however , these measurements yielded only upper limits or rough estimates of the @xmath0f level widths .",
    "recently , lee et al . investigated the level widths of these four states in @xmath0f via the elastic resonance scattering of @xmath1o+@xmath7 based on a thick target inverse kinematics method @xcite .",
    "although these authors significantly improved values for these level widths of @xmath0f , it is still desirable to perform a new measurement of these level widths via an independent approach .    in the present work , we measure the angular distributions of the @xmath1n(@xmath2li,@xmath3li)@xmath0n reaction populating the four low - lying states in @xmath0n . the neutron spectroscopic factors and the asymptotic normalization coefficients ( ancs ) for these states",
    "are then derived based on distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) analysis .",
    "the proton widths of the four low - lying resonant states in the mirror analog @xmath0f are extracted according to charge symmetry of mirror nuclei .",
    "similar approach has been successfully used to study many mirror pairs such as @xmath11b-@xmath11n @xcite , @xmath1c-@xmath1f @xcite , @xmath12mg-@xmath12p @xcite and @xmath13ni-@xmath13cu @xcite .",
    "most recently , a short paper concerning the @xmath1n(@xmath2li,@xmath3li)@xmath0n angular distributions and determination of the astrophysical @xmath1n(@xmath6,@xmath14)@xmath0n reaction rate has been published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the angular distributions was performed at the hi-13 tandem accelerator of the china institute of atomic energy ( ciae ) in beijing . the experimental setup and",
    "procedures are similar to those reported previously @xcite .",
    "a @xmath2li beam with an energy of 44 mev was used to measure the angular distributions of the @xmath1n(@xmath2li,@xmath3li)@xmath0n reaction populating the ground state and the first three excited states at @xmath15 = 0.120 , 0.298 , and 0.397 mev in @xmath0n .",
    "in addition , the angular distribution of the @xmath2li+@xmath1n elastic scattering was measured to obtain the optical model potential ( omp ) parameters for the entrance channel of the transfer reaction . to extract the exit channel omp parameters a 34.5 mev @xmath16li beam",
    "was also delivered for the measurement of the angular distribution for the @xmath16li+@xmath1n elastic scattering .",
    "melamine c@xmath17n@xmath17(@xmath1nh@xmath18)@xmath17 enriched to 99.35% in @xmath1n was employed as target material with a thickness of 46 @xmath19g/@xmath20 , which was evaporated on a 30 @xmath19g/@xmath20 thick carbon foil . in addition , a @xmath4n target was used for background evaluation . to improve the thermal conductivity of the targets",
    "a 22 @xmath19g/@xmath20 thick gold was evaporated on melamine foil .",
    "the target thickness was determined using an analytical balance with a precision of 1 @xmath19 g and was verified with the well - known differential cross sections of the @xmath2li+@xmath1n elastic scattering at @xmath21 = 33.5@xmath22 and 49.2@xmath22 @xcite . after considering the balance precision and the error of the differential cross sections , an uncertainty of 5% was assigned for target thickness .",
    "a movable faraday cup covering an angular range of @xmath236@xmath22 in laboratory frame was used to measure the beam current for normalization of the cross sections at @xmath24 .",
    "the faraday cup was removed when measuring the cross sections at @xmath25 . a silicon @xmath26 telescope located at @xmath27",
    "was employed for normalization of the cross sections at @xmath25 by measuring the elastic scattering of the incident ions on the targets .",
    "the reaction products were analyzed with a q3d magnetic spectrograph and were recorded by a two - dimensional position - sensitive silicon detector ( pssd , 50@xmath2850 mm ) placed at the focal plane of the spectrograph .",
    "the two - dimensional position information from the pssd enabled the products emitted into the acceptable solid angle to be recorded completely .",
    "the energy information from the pssd was used to remove the impurities with the same magnetic rigidity .    as an example , figure [ fig2 ] displays the focal - plane position spectra of the @xmath3li events at @xmath29 = 18@xmath22 from the elastic scattering on the enriched @xmath1n target and the natural @xmath4n target .",
    "one sees that the events from the elastic scattering on different isotopes in the targets can be clearly separated .",
    "the events from the elastic scattering on carbon and gold ran out of the pssd due to larger energy differences .",
    "it should be mentioned that the elastic scattering events from @xmath1n and @xmath4n can not be separated any more when measuring the cross sections at @xmath29 @xmath30 15@xmath22 .",
    "this is because the energy difference of @xmath3li from the elastic scattering on different isotopes decreases with @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the background from @xmath4n needs to be evaluated to obtain the cross sections at @xmath29 @xmath30 15@xmath22 .",
    "the angular distributions of the elastic scattering were obtained after background substraction and beam normalization , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we display the focal - plane position spectrum of @xmath16li at @xmath29=10@xmath22 from the @xmath1n(@xmath2li,@xmath3li)@xmath0n reaction leading to the ground state and the first three excited states at @xmath15 = 0.120 , 0.298 , and 0.397 mev in @xmath0n .",
    "the closely spaced levels in @xmath0n were resolved and the background from @xmath4n is negligibly small .",
    "after background subtraction and beam normalization , the angular distributions of the @xmath1n(@xmath2li,@xmath3li)@xmath0n reaction were obtained , as presented in fig .",
    "the experimental angular distributions were analyzed with the finite - range dwba code fresco @xcite .",
    "the omp parameters for the entrance and exit channels were extracted by fitting the present experimental angular distributions of the @xmath2li+@xmath1n and @xmath3li+@xmath1n elastic scattering ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the starting values of the omp parameters were obtained by fitting the systematic nucleus - nucleus potential based on a single - folding model @xcite .",
    "the real potential was chosen as a squared woods - saxon form , which fits the real part of the folding model potential better than the usual woods - saxon form does @xcite .",
    "for the imaginary potential the usual woods - saxon form was found to be appropriate .",
    "in addition , we investigated the effect of spin - orbit potential parameters although for heavy ions they are thought to have little or no influence on the cross sections @xcite .",
    "full complex remnant term interactions were included in the transfer reaction calculations .",
    "the core - core ( @xmath3li+@xmath1n ) potential parameters were determined using the present ones of @xmath3li+@xmath1n at 34.5 mev and the systematics in energy dependence of the potential parameters of ref .",
    "for the wave function of bound states , the woods - saxon potential with the standard geometric parameters ( @xmath31 = 1.25 fm and @xmath32 = 0.65 fm ) was adopted , which have been extensively utilized to study the ground state neutron spectroscopic factors for 80 nuclei of @xmath33 = 3 - 24 @xcite and 565 excited state neutron spectroscopic factors for @xmath33 = 8 - 28 nuclei @xcite . the potential depths were adjusted to reproduce the neutron binding energies .",
    "all the parameters are listed in table [ tab1 ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ tab4 ] we compare different evaluations of the proton widths from the present work and the previous studies .",
    "the present width of the @xmath0f ground state is narrower than the lower limits from the compilation @xcite and the @xmath4n(@xmath5he,@xmath6 ) data @xcite , and is narrower than the value from the @xmath0o(@xmath5he,@xmath8 ) data @xcite .",
    "the new width of the first excited state is larger than the upper limits of refs .",
    "@xcite , while is narrower than those of refs .",
    "the present width of the second excited state is narrower than the lower limits from the compilation @xcite and the @xmath4n(@xmath5he,@xmath6 ) data @xcite .",
    "in addition , our results are in good agreement with those from the most recent @xmath7(@xmath1o,@xmath7 ) data @xcite for all the levels except the first excited state .",
    "the width of 103@xmath349 kev for the first excited state given in ref .",
    "@xcite would yield a spectroscopic factor of 1.22@xmath340.11 , which is significantly larger than the present result ( 0.65@xmath340.08 ) from the @xmath1n(@xmath2li,@xmath3li)@xmath0n data and that ( 0.74@xmath340.12 ) from the @xmath1n(@xmath35,@xmath36)@xmath0n data @xcite and the shell model prediction ( 0.96 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , additional measurements of this width via an independent method are certainly desirable .",
    "the angular distributions of the @xmath1n(@xmath2li,@xmath3li)@xmath0n reaction were measured by a high - precision q3d magnetic spectrograph and were utilized to determine the neutron spectroscopic factors and the ancs for the four low - lying @xmath0n states .",
    "we also investigated the dependence of our results on the geometric parameters of the woods - saxon potential for the single - particle bound state in @xmath0n .",
    "it was found that the ancs for the two levels corresponding to neutron transfers to the 1@xmath37 orbit are more model independent than the ancs for the two levels corresponding to neutron transfers to the 2@xmath38 orbit .",
    "this difference may come from the different peripheralities of these two transitions .",
    "the proton widths of the four low - lying levels in @xmath0f were determined from the @xmath0n spectroscopic factors by charge symmetry of mirror nuclei .",
    "in addition , we studied the dependence of the proton widths on the geometric parameters of the woods - saxon potential .",
    "the result demonstrates that the proton widths of these four states in @xmath0f are all model independent .",
    "the new widths are in good agreement with those from the most recent @xmath7(@xmath1o,@xmath7 ) data @xcite for the ground state , the second and third excited states in @xmath0f .",
    "for the first excited state the present width is nearly half of that in ref .",
