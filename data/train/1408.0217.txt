    "advances in thin film epitaxy growth techniques have made it possible to induce emergent electronic  @xcite , magnetic  @xcite and orbital  @xcite states , which are not naturally occurring in bulk constituents , at atomically sharp transition metal oxide interfaces  @xcite .",
    "for example , the interface between the two nonmagnetic band insulators laalo@xmath1 and srtio@xmath1  @xcite has been reported to exhibit both conductance  @xcite and magnetism  @xcite ( see reviews  @xcite and references therein ) . at the interface of mott insulators srmno@xmath1 and lamno@xmath1 , hole doping on the mn sites leads to rich phenomena , including metal - insulator transition , charge / spin / orbital ordering and magnetoresistance  @xcite .    in laalo@xmath1/srtio@xmath1 and related heterostructures , the interface electron gas is believed to be produced by the polar catastrophe mechanism , which leads to the transfer of charge from the sample surface to the interface . here , we consider a different mechanism for controlling the electronic properties of an interface : namely , electronegativity - driven charge transfer .",
    "recently , we have shown that internal charge transfer in a latio@xmath1/lanio@xmath1 superlattice transforms metallic lanio@xmath1 into a @xmath2 mott insulator and mott insulating latio@xmath1 into a @xmath3 band insulator  @xcite .",
    "a natural question arises : can we reverse the process and utilize internal charge transfer to induce conductance via oxide interfaces ? in this regard , it is very tempting to explore mott interfaces ( one or both constituents are mott insulators ) due to the unusual phenomena ( colossal magnetoresistance and high temperature superconductivity ) exhibited in certain doped mott insulators .",
    "in this paper we use density functional theory + dynamical mean field theory ( dft+dmft ) to theoretically design a superlattice with emergent metallic behavior .",
    "we explore two different types of structure : the perovskite structure ( referred to as 113-type ) and the @xmath4 ruddlesden - popper structure ( referred to as 214-type ) . among the four bulk constituents ( srvo@xmath1 , srmno@xmath1 , sr@xmath0vo@xmath5 and sr@xmath0mno@xmath5 ) , all are correlation - driven insulators except srvo@xmath1 , which is a moderately correlated metal  @xcite .",
    "we show that the difference of electronegativity between the elements v and mn drives internal charge transfer from v to mn sites , leading to a `` self - doping '' at the interface and possibly inducing conductance as mn sites become weakly electron doped and v sites hole doped .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section ii presents the theoretical methods .",
    "a schematic of band alignment is presented in section iii to illustrate the underlying mechanism of charge transfer .",
    "all the bulk results from _ ab initio _ calculations are in section iv and the results of vanadate - manganite superlattices are in section v , both of which provide qualitative support and quantitative corrections to the schematic .",
    "the conclusions are in section vi .",
    "five appendices present technical details relating to the insulating gaps of sr@xmath0vo@xmath5 and sr@xmath0mno@xmath5 , alternative forms of the double counting correction , lda spectra of the superlattices and the possibility of two consecutive repeating layers ( i.e. 2/2 superlattices instead of 1/1 superlattices ) .",
    "the dft  @xcite component of our dft+dmft  @xcite calculations is performed using a plane - wave basis  @xcite , as implemented in the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) approach  @xcite . both local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite and perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalied gradient approximation ( gga - pbe )",
    "@xcite are employed .",
    "the correlated subspace and the orbitals with which it mixes are constructed using maximally localized wannier functions  @xcite defined over the full 10 ev range spanned by the @xmath6-@xmath7 band complex , resulting in an well localized set of @xmath7-like orbitals  @xcite . to find the stationary solution for our dft+dmft functional , we first find the self - consistent charge density within dft .",
    "subsequently we fix the charge density and converge the dmft equations .",
    "a full charge self - consistency is not implemented in the present work . however",
    ", this approximation procedure is found to yield reasonable results in calculations of bulk systems  @xcite .",
    "for the bulk materials , we consider two structures : the experimental one and the theoretical relaxed structure obtained by the use of dft . for the superlattice",
    ", we use dft to obtain the relaxed structure .",
    "we compare lda and gga calculations and both exchange correlation functions yield consistent results .",
    "the simulation cell is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] .",
    "the stacking direction of the superlattice is along [ 001 ] .",
    "we use an energy cutoff 600 ev . a @xmath8 $ ] ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the lattice constants along the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions , and [ @xmath11 ]",
    "is the integer part of @xmath11 ) monkhorst - pack grid is used to sample the brillouin zone .",
    "both cell and internal coordinates are fully relaxed until each force component is smaller than 10 mev /   and the stress tensor is smaller than 10 kbar .",
    "convergence of the key results are tested with a higher energy cutoff ( 800 ev ) and a denser @xmath14-point sampling @xmath15 $ ] and no significant changes are found .    for the vanadates , we treat the empty @xmath16 orbitals with a static hartree - fock approximation ( recent work shows this approximation is adequate to describe the electronic structure of vanadates  @xcite ) , while correlations in the v @xmath17 manifold are treated within single - site dmft including the slater - kanamori interactions using intra - orbital hubbard @xmath18 = 5 ev and @xmath19 = 0.65 ev  @xcite . for manganites",
    ", we treat the correlations on all the five mn @xmath7 orbitals within single - site dmft using the slater - kanamori interactions with intra - orbital hubbard @xmath20 = 5 ev and @xmath21 = 1 ev  @xcite .",
    "the dmft impurity problem is solved using the continuous time quantum monte carlo method  @xcite . in order to use the `` segment '' algorithm  @xcite",
    ", we neglect the exchange and pairing terms in the slater - kanamori hamiltonian .",
    "all the calculations are paramagnetic and the temperature is set to 232 k. long - range magnetic ordering ( in particular antiferromagnetism ) might be induced at low temperature on mn sites in manganites and in superlattices .",
    "a thorough study of magnetic properties will be presented elsewhere  @xcite . for the superlattice",
    ", we solve the problem in the single - site dmft approximation , meaning that the self energy is site local and is one function on the v site and a different one on the mn site .",
    "the self energies are determined from two quantum impurity models , which are solved independently but coupled at the level of the self consistency condition .",
    "an important outstanding issue in the dft+dmft procedure is the `` double counting correction '' which accounts for the part of the slater - kanamori interactions already included in the underlying dft calculation and plays an important role by setting the mean energy difference between the @xmath7 and @xmath6 bands .",
    "the @xmath6-@xmath7 separation plays a crucial role in determining the band alignment , which affects the charge transfer . however , currently there is no exact procedure for the double counting correction .",
    "we use the @xmath22 double counting method recently introduced  @xcite , where the parameter @xmath22 is the prefactor in the double - counting which determines the @xmath6-@xmath7 separation and equivalently the number of electrons in the @xmath7-manifold . in this study , @xmath22 is chosen to produce an energy separation between the o @xmath6 and transition metal @xmath7 bands which is consistent with photoemission experiments .",
    "our main qualitative conclusions do not depend on the details of the double counting scheme ; in particular we show here they hold also for the conventional fully localized limit ( fll ) double counting  @xcite which is the @xmath23 limit of the method of ref .",
    "the reason behind that is because in the superlattice , it is the relative v@xmath7-mn@xmath7 energy separation that controls the charge transfer .",
    "the fll double counting formula underestimates the @xmath6-@xmath7 separation in both srvo@xmath1 and srmno@xmath1 by about 1 ev .",
    "however , such an error is cancelled in the calculation of v@xmath7-mn@xmath7 energy separation .",
    "therefore the fll double counting does not change the charge transfer picture .",
    "the spectral function presented throughout this work is defined as follows :    @xmath24^{-1}\\right)_{ii}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the label of a wannier function , @xmath26 is the number of @xmath14-points , @xmath27 is an identity matrix , @xmath28 is the dft - lda band hamiltonian in the matrix form using the wannier basis .",
    "@xmath29 is the total self - energy and is understood as a diagonal matrix only with nonzero entries on the correlated orbitals .",
    "local tetragonal point symmetry of the v and mn sites ensures that @xmath30 is diagonal within the correlated orbital subspace .",
    "@xmath31 is the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath32 is the double counting potential , which is defined as  @xcite :    @xmath33    note that if @xmath23 , then we restore the standard fll double counting formula  @xcite . for clarity",
    ", all the spectra functions presented in this paper are obtained from lda+dmft calculations .",
    "gga+dmft calculations yield qualitatively consistent results .",
    "we consider the following materials as components of the superlattice : srvo@xmath1 , a moderately correlated metal with nominal @xmath7-valence @xmath34 ; sr@xmath0vo@xmath5 , a correlation - driven insulator also with nominal valence @xmath34 ; and srmno@xmath1 and sr@xmath0mno@xmath5 , both of which are @xmath35 correlation - driven ( mott ) insulators .",

    "fig : band]*b * ) , the highest occupied states are mn @xmath17-derived and the lowest unoccupied states are mn @xmath16-derived . due to the electronegativity difference between v and mn , visible as the difference in the energy separation of the transition metal @xmath7 levels from the oxygen @xmath6 levels , if we align the o @xmath6 states between vanadates and manganites ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : band]*c * ) , the occupied v @xmath17 states overlap in energy with the unoccupied mn @xmath16 states .",
    "the overlap drives electrons from v sites to mn sites .",
    "as the superlattice is formed , a common fermi level appears across the interface and thus we expect that mn @xmath16 states become electron doped and v @xmath17 states hole doped .",
    "we make two additional points : i ) though srvo@xmath1 is a metal and sr@xmath0vo@xmath5 is an insulator with a small energy gap ( around 0.2 ev )  @xcite , the near fermi level electronic structure does not affect the band alignment and therefore the internal charge transfer is expected to occur no matter whether there is a small energy gap in v @xmath17 states at the fermi level or not ; ii ) in our schematic , we assume that the main peak of o @xmath6 states are exactly aligned between the vanadates and manganites in the superlattices . of course , real material effects will spoil any exact alignment .",
