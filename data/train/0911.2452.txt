    "in recent years , uniformly doped quantum wells ( qws ) have generated increasing interest due to the long relaxation times measured therein.@xcite the long relaxation times are due to spins localized on donor centers .",
    "while similar relaxation times have been measured in modulation doped systems , their duration has not been as reliable due to the weaker binding energy of localized states and potential fluctuations from remote impurities.@xcite localization is either not seen at all@xcite or localization centers thermally ionize rapidly with increasing temperature due to a small binding energy.@xcite qws uniformly doped within the well have the advantage of being characterized by well defined impurity centers with a larger binding energy .",
    "the experimental control in the amount of doping and well size make doped qws particularly appealing to the study of quasi - two - dimensional spin dynamics .",
    "much of the theoretical study of spin relaxation in semiconducting systems ( qws in particular ) has either focused solely on itinerant electrons@xcite or solely on localized electrons@xcite without regard for either the presence of the other state or the interaction between the two states .",
    "recently the existence and interaction between itinerant and localized states has been dealt with in bulk systems by putikka and joynt@xcite and harmon et al.@xcite .",
    "the results of these calculations are in very good quantitative and qualitative agreement with experimental observations@xcite in bulk n - gaas and n - zno . in this paper ,",
    "the theory of two interacting spin subsystems is applied to qws .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section [ section2 ] describes the optical generation of spin polarization in qws ; section [ blochsection ] introduces a set of modified bloch equations to model spin dynamics ; section [ occupations ] calculates the equilibrium populations of localized and conductions states ; section [ relaxationsection ] determines the relaxation rates for all pertinent mechanisms for localized and conduction electrons ; sections [ resultsgaas ] and [ resultscdte ] compare our results to two gaas qws ( uniformly doped and undoped ) and one uniformly doped cdte qw ; section [ discussion ] discusses our findings , suggests future work , and proposes qws for spin liftime optimization ; we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in qws at low temperatures the creation of non - zero spin polarization , in the conduction band and donor states , proceeds from the formation of trions ( charged excitons , @xmath0 ) and exciton - bound - donor complexes ( @xmath1 ) respectively , from the absorption of circularly polarized light .",
    "polarization via the trion avenue is most relevant for modulation doped qws where donor centers in the well are sparse.@xcite due to the modulation doping outside the well , the number of conduction electrons in the well may be plentiful . in such cases , assuming incident @xmath2 pump pulse , a @xmath3 hole and @xmath4 electron are created .",
    "these bind with a resident electron from the electron gas in the qw to form a trion ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the ` stolen ' electron will be @xmath6 to form a singlet state with the exciton s electron .",
    "hence , the electron gas will be left negatively polarized since the excitons are preferentially formed with spin up resident electrons .",
    "if the hole spin relaxes faster than the trion decays the electron gas will remain polarized.@xcite selection rules dictate @xmath3 ( @xmath7 ) holes will recombine only with @xmath4 ( @xmath6 ) electrons .",
    "therefore if the hole spins relax rapidly , the released electrons will have no net polarization and the polarized electron gas will remain predominantly negatively oriented .",
    "a very similar picture is given for the polarization of donor bound electrons in uniformly doped qws where the donor bound electrons play the role of the resident electrons .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures the donors are nearly all occupied and the density of the electron gas will be negligible . when excitations are tuned at the exciton - bound - donor resonance , instead of photo - excitons binding with the resident electron gas , they bind with neutral donors to form the complexes @xmath8 .",
    "this notation implies that a @xmath3 hole - @xmath4 electron exciton bound to a @xmath6 donor bound electron . once again for very short hole relaxation times , the donor bound electrons can be spin polarized .",
    "the measured long spin relaxation times in uniformly doped qws imply that spin polarization remains after short time processes such as @xmath9 and @xmath1 recombination have completed . in other words , the translational degrees of freedom",
    "thermalize much more quickly than the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the occupational statistics of itinerant and localized electrons are important and can be determined from equilibrium thermodynamics .    as the temperature",
    "is increased , the electrons bound to donors thermally ionize and become itinerant . in analogy with the trion case , if the excitation energy is maintained at the @xmath1 frequency , the initial polarization should decrease as there are fewer @xmath1 complexes allowed.@xcite however as the number of electrons in the conduction states increases , the spin that exists on the donors will equilibrate by cross relaxing to conduction states by the isotropic exchange interaction .",
    "if cross relaxation is rapid enough , the total spin , which is conserved by exchange , will now exist in the donor and conduction states weighted by their respective equilibrium densities.@xcite the polarized electron moments will then proceed to relax via different processes for the localized and itinerant states . since trion binding energies ( @xmath10 mev)@xcite are smaller than donor - exciton binding energies ( @xmath11 mev),@xcite polarization of itinerant electrons via trion formation should be negligible as the temperature is increased .",
    "the above description is complicated when the photoexcitation energy is at the exciton resonance and not the exciton - bound - donor resonance .",
    "in such a case , the excitons may recombine or the electron - in - exciton spin may relax before binding to a donor so one expects the low temperature spin relaxation to reflect also the exciton spin dynamics instead of the donor electron spin dynamics alone.@xcite in essence , the electrons in an exciton represent a third spin environment with a characteristic spin relaxation time scale different from that of the localized donor and itinerant electrons . because of the electron s proximity to a hole , relaxation may result from spin exchange or recombination .",
    "therefore to understand the spin dynamics in qws , it is imperative to examine the relaxation processes that affect the polarized spin moments of the various spin systems .",
    "after rapid exciton - donor - bound complex formation , recombination , and hole relaxation , we model the zero field spin dynamics of the system in terms of modified bloch equations : @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are the conduction ( localized ) magnetizations , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are the conduction ( localized ) equilibrium occupation densities , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) are the conduction ( localized ) spin relaxation times , and @xmath19 is a parameter describing the cross relaxation time between the two spin subsystems .",
    "mahan and woodworth@xcite have shown the cross relaxation time between impurity and conduction electron spins to be much shorter than any of the other spin relaxation times relevant here .",
    "we shall assume below that the same is true for the cross relaxation between electrons bound in an exciton and conduction or impurity electron spins .",
    "the motivation of these modified bloch equations is set forth in refs .",
    "( ) and ( ) . eqs .",
    "( [ bloch0 ] ) is valid for photoexcitation energies that do not cause free exciton formation ( only two relevant spin systems ) .",
    "it is important to note that eqs .",
    "( [ bloch0 ] ) hold only for intermediate time scales .",
    "these scales are long compared with laser pulse times , energy relaxation times that determine subsystem populations and donor - bound exciton formation times .",
    "fortunately , these intermediate time scales are the ones probed in the experiments .",
    "standard methods can be used to solve these differential equations with initial conditions @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the initial spin polarization is perpendicular to the qw s growth plane and that the excitation density , @xmath22 , is small enough such that the resultant spin relaxation time , @xmath23 , will not depend strongly on @xmath22.@xcite the solutions yield a time dependence of the total magnetization @xmath24 to be a sum of two exponentials - one of which is @xmath25 and the other of which has a time constant proportional to the cross relaxation time . in the case of rapid cross relaxation ( faster than all spin relaxation mechanisms ) , only one exponential survives and we express the total relaxation rate as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total impurity concentration .",
    "this model , or variations of it , has been successfully applied to bulk n - gaas and bulk n - zno .",
    "@xcite    if the photoexcitation energy is set near the exciton energy , the bloch equations must be modified to take into account exciton spin relaxation and multiple cross relaxations : @xmath28 for @xmath29 for conduction , localized , and excition spins respectively .",
    "we model exciton spin relaxation as electron - in - exciton spin relaxation@xcite and assume that hole spin relaxation is very rapid .",
    "( [ bloch0 ] ) generalizes to @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents spin lifetime of an electron bound to a hole . @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the number ( magnetization ) of electrons bound in an exciton .",
    "@xmath22 is the initial density of photoexcited electrons and the quantity @xmath34 is the number of photoexcited electrons that do not participate in an exciton .",
    "we assume quasi - equilibrium such that @xmath32 is determined from thermodynamics ( see section [ occupations ] ) .",
    "it should be stated that eq .",
    "( [ bloch2 ] ) is valid only for times shorter than the recombination time ; in other words , on a time scale where @xmath22 can be assumed to not change significantly .",
    "recombination times have been measured@xcite in similar systems as to those studied here to be longer than the observed spin relaxation times so this approximation seems justified . in section [ resultsgaas ]",
    ", we find that the effects of recombination of free carriers can be added to @xmath35 to obtain excellent agreement with the experimental data .    if we solve the system of equations in eq .",
    "( [ bloch2 ] ) as we did for eq .",
    "( [ bloch0 ] ) , we obtain the relaxation rate @xmath36    for both eqs .",

    "as shown above , the relative occupations of localized and itinerant states play an important role in our theory . fortunately , in two dimensional systems , the occupation probabilities of the two states ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) can be determined exactly .",
    "the densities we are interested in are dilute enough such that the non - degenerate limit ( boltzmann statistics ) can be utilized .    [ occ ]    the probability for a donor to be singly occupied ( only the ground state needs to be considered@xcite ) is@xcite @xmath41 the density of itinerant states is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and the conduction band edge is taken to be zero energy .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath44 can be found using the constraint @xmath45 using the result for @xmath44 , one obtains @xmath46 where @xmath47    an example of the temperature dependence of these occupation probabilities is shown for a gaas qw in figure 1 where @xmath48 @xmath49 . at the lowest temperatures ,",
    "the donors are fully occupied . as the temperature increases , @xmath16 decreases and @xmath15 increases to where at around @xmath50 k , the two occupation probabilities are equal . from eqs .",
    "( [ bloch ] , [ bloch3 ] ) , it is evident that these occupational statistics have ramifications in the measured spin relaxation times .",
    "the results here are also applied to the excitons in quasi - equilibrium .",
    "we now discuss the relevant spin relaxation mechanisms for both localized and conduction electrons . the electron - in - exciton spin relaxation , @xmath31 , is a combination of electron - hole recombination and electron - hole exchange relaxation . due to its complicated nature",
    "we defer the calculation of @xmath31 to future work . here",
    "we treat it as a phenomenological parameter .",
    "first we discuss spin relaxation via the anisotropic spin exchange for donor bound electrons .",
    "this has been treated extensively elsewhere .",
    "@xcite most recently it has been examined by kavokin in ref .",
    "it is his treatment that we detail below for semiconducting qws .",
    "kavokin argues@xcite that some portion of localized relaxation results from spin diffusion due to the exchange interaction between donors .",
    "anisotropic corrections to the isotropic exchange hamiltonian cause a spin to rotate through an angle @xmath28 when it is transferred between two donor centers located at positions @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the angle - averaged rotation angle is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the spin orbit length.@xcite the spin is relaxed when the accumulated rotation angle @xmath55 becomes on the order of unity such that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the diffusion coefficient and the relaxation time is @xmath58 in quasi-2d ( 100 ) qws where dresselhaus bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) terms dominate,@xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a dimensionless measure of the spin orbit strength and @xmath61 is due to the quasi-2d confinement and is of the form @xmath62 . for infinite well confinement @xmath63 .",

    "these results can be combined to obtain the relaxation rate in terms of a dimensionless impurity separation scale , @xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "localized electron spins may also relax due to nuclear fields .",
    "a localized electron is coupled to many nuclear spins by the hyperfine interaction . to the electrons ,",
    "these nuclear spins appear as a randomly fluctuating field but these nuclear fields can be assumed quasi - stationary since the nuclear evolution time is much longer than electron evolution time due to the contrast in magnetic moments.@xcite what governs the electron spin evolution is the electron correlation time , @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath72 is long such that @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is the root - mean - square field , @xmath75 is the maximum nuclear field , and @xmath76 is the number of nuclei in the electron s localization volume ) , then the electron polarization decays due to ensemble dephasing ; there will be random electron precession frequencies due to a random distribution of frozen nuclear fields.@xcite if the mechanism contributing to the electron correlation time is exchange induced spin diffusion , @xmath72 is estimated to be @xmath77 in quasi - two dimensions.@xcite    merkulov et al.@xcite find a dephasing rate for quantum dots to be @xmath78 where the sum over @xmath38 is a sum over all nuclei in the unit cell , @xmath79 is the nuclear spin , @xmath80 is the hyperfine constant , and @xmath81 is the number of nuclei in the electron s localized volume .",
    "it is important to state that this spin dephasing does not decay exponentially but decreases to @xmath82 of the original spin polarization in @xmath83 and then increases to @xmath84 of the original spin polarization in @xmath85 where it will then decay at a much slower rate.@xcite    if @xmath72 is short such that @xmath86 , then the relaxation will be of the motional narrowing type.@xcite      conduction band states undergo ordinary impurity and phonon scattering .",
    "each scattering event gives a change in the wave vector @xmath87 , which in turn changes the effective magnetic field on the spin that comes from spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this fluctuating field relaxes the spin .",

    "this same non - monotonicity has been observed bulk gaas and zno.@xcite    using our results we propose that n - doped ( 110 ) qws should optimize spin lifetimes ( when excited at exciton - bound - donor frequency ) since dp is suppressed .",

    "the decrease seen in gaas is now due to depopulation of donor states instead of exciton thermalization .",
    "the depopulation is much slower in cdte since the doping is higher .",
    "the up - turn in the cdte curve as room temperature is reached is due to ey which is too weak to be seen in gaas .",
    "we plot the data points from the undoped ( 110 ) gaas qw for comparison . by avoiding the creation of excitons and their short lifetimes ,",
    "long spin relaxation times can be achieved .",

    "we find that the spin relaxation times in n - doped qws can be well described by a theory invoking spin exchange between spin species . in undoped ( 110 )",
    "qws , where dp is absent , we find that exciton spin relaxation is important and leads to the observed surprising temperature dependence .",
    "we predict that a similar temperature dependence ( though with longer relaxation times ) should be observed in n - doped ( 110 ) qws when excited at the exciton - bound - donor frequency .",
    "we have suggested future experimental work to resolve what mechanisms relax spin localized on donors in n - doped gaas and cdte qws .",
