    "many physical systems , in particular glass forming liquids , display a very slow dynamics at low temperature / high density @xcite .",
    "the laboratory glass transition corresponds to the temperature / density at which the structural relaxation timescale becomes larger than the experimental one ( e.g. one hour ) . at this point",
    "the glass - forming liquid falls out of equilibrium and becomes an amorphous rigid material called glass .",
    "thus , the laboratory glass transition is nothing else than a dynamical crossover and not a true dynamical transition .",
    "however , a natural question is whether this dramatic increasing of the structural relaxation time is due to an underlying dynamical transition that takes place at lower temperature / higher density ( but that is unreachable experimentally ) .",
    "indeed different analytical approaches , in particular the mode - coupling - theory ( mct ) of the glass transition @xcite predict a dynamical arrest at a finite temperature and chemical potential at which the structural relaxation timescale diverges and the diffusion coefficient of a tagged particle , called self - diffusion coefficient @xmath1 , vanishes .",
    "the interpretation of this transition is based on the cage effect : particles are trapped in the cage formed by their neighbors ( however see also @xcite ) . for particles interacting with a smooth potential",
    "it is widely accepted that this mct transition describes at most a dynamical crossover .",
    "instead in the case of potentials with a hard core part , in particular hard sphere systems , there is no agreement .",
    "experiments on colloids @xcite , that can be indeed modeled by hard sphere systems , are very often interpreted as if a real dynamical transition took place . however , in these systems the microscopic timescale is much larger than for the other glass forming liquids ( approximatively nine order of magnitude ) , thus it could be argued that one is just looking to the very first part of the increasing of the relaxation timescale , here mct indeed applies but the point at which the dynamical mct crossover takes place is shifted toward unreachable experimental timescales .",
    "what can one say theoretically about the existence of this type of transition called sometimes dynamical arrest ?",
    "first let us focus on the case of interacting particle systems on a lattice .",
    "if the potential between the particle is short - range , the hamiltonian is not singular and the only constraint is the hard core one , i.e. maximum one particle per site , then it has been proved by spohn @xcite that on long time and length scales the tagged particle performs a simple brownian motion with a self - diffusion coefficient that is positive at any finite temperature and any finite chemical potential ( these models are called in the mathematical literature symmetric exclusion processes with speed change and spin exchange dynamics ; in the following we ll refer simply to them as rlg , i.e. reversible lattice gases ) .",
    "actually , one needs also the system to be ergodic but physically this is just due to the fact that if there is a very large correlation length and/or a very large correlation time than , in principle , the tagged particle will enter in the brownian motion regime on larger length and time scales .",
    "so at a critical point the tagged particle could take an infinite time to enter in the brownian motion regime .",
    "however the lower bound on the self diffusion coefficient proved in @xcite is valid regardless of the existence of a critical point .",
    "thus , even if a phase transition would take place at a temperature @xmath3 and a chemical potential @xmath4 one gets @xmath5 .    however , the lattice models that are known to display a whole phenomenology analogous to glass forming liquids and for which the existence of a dynamical arrest at finite temperature / chemical potential has been suggested , are the ones in which further hard constraints besides hard core , are imposed . among the most studied ones there are the kinetically constrained lattice gases ( kclg ) for which the jump rates of particles are different from zero not only if the constraint of having maximum one particle per site is verified but _ also _ if some additional constraint is verified , hence the name kinetically constrained ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "we will comment on the extension of our work to statically constrained models , like the lattice glass models introduced in @xcite , and more general cases in the conclusion .",
    "note that the presence of additional hard constraints can change the physical mechanism behind tagged particle diffusion quite a lot . as explained in @xcite the kclg are characterized at high density by the existence of `` defects '' that are the analog of vacancies for the rlg .",
    "a rather good understanding has been reached for models in which defects , that can freely move in an otherwise completely filled lattice , consist in a finite number , independent of the particle density , of vacancies . instead ,",
    "the cases in which the motion of `` defects '' involve a number of vacancies that diverges when the particle density approaches one , were much less understood . indeed in the literature one can find numerical simulations suggesting a dynamical transition at a density less than one @xcite .",
    "recently , in collaboration with d.s .",
    "fisher @xcite , we have analyzed one of the most studied model of this type , the kob - andersen model @xcite proving that no dynamical transition takes place whatsoever and unveiling what is the mechanism inducing the slow dynamics .",
    "our results and techniques apply also to the other highly cooperative kclg @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show how one can , under very general assumptions , generalize the proof of diffusivity , @xmath2 of @xcite to kclg ( this has been already done for simple kclg with finite size defects in @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is twofold .",
    "first , we want to show that under very general assumptions ( see next sections and conclusion ) a dynamical arrest can not take place at finite temperature / chemical potential even if there are hard constraints other than the hard core one .",
    "second , we want to present a rigorous technique and a method that allows to obtain upper and lower bounds on the self - diffusion coefficient for kclg ( or more general interacting particle systems ) .",
    "the usual techniques applied to kclg in order to obtain predictions on @xmath1 , as diagrammatic resummation or approximate closure of exact equations ( see @xcite ) , are completely out of control in the high density regime .",
    "although some of them work well in the intermediate density regime compared to the results of numerical simulations , they fail in general at high density and , often , predict a spurious dynamical transition .",
    "thus , in this context it is particularly important to have rigorous methods that allow one to obtain solid analytical predictions .",
    "we will focus on the kob - andersen model as an example but our method can be applied to also other kclg or more general interacting particle systems .",
    "let us finally comment on the continuum case .",
    "we are not aware of any proof of diffusivity at low temperature / high density in the case of hamiltonian dynamics . instead",
    "in the case of interacting brownian particles , even with hard core ( a good model for colloidal systems ) , it has been recently shown that the self diffusion coefficient is positive at any finite temperature / chemical potential under very general assumptions @xcite .",
    "the proof works for hard spheres , lennard - jones potential , etc  and it is , as our proof , a generalization of the spohn s proof @xcite for rlg .",
    "_ organization of the paper _",
    "+ we think that the technique we will make use of is not well known in the community working on kclg therefore we have written this article in a detailed and self - contained way .",
    "the expert reader may skip section [ taggedparticle ] and quickly go through section [ triangular ] . + we introduce in detail the kclg in section [ kcm ] and we explain in detail the ka model in section [ kadefinition ] . in section [ taggedparticle ]",
    "we recall some probabilistic techniques that have been used to prove bounds on the self diffusion coefficient for the rlg @xcite . in section",
    "[ triangular ] , focusing on the ka model on a triangular lattice as an example , we explain how one can obtain the high density behavior of the self diffusion coefficient for kclg with `` defects '' formed by a finite number of vacancies .",
    "this section is useful to introduce the notation and the method before facing the difficult case of highly cooperative kclg . in section [ square ] ,",
    "focusing on the ka model on a square lattice , we explain how one can obtain strictly positive lower bounds in the case of highly cooperative kclg .",
    "finally , in [ conclusion ] we present a final discussion of our results .",
    "in the last twenty years there has been a growing interest in kinetically constrained lattice gases .",
    "these were introduced as models for supercooled liquids close to the glass transition @xcite and nowadays they are also studied as paradigm for general glassy systems @xcite .",
    "kclg are ( apparently ) similar to rlg . as discussed before there is however an important difference in the choice of the jump rates of particles that are different from zero not only if the constraint of having maximum one particle per site is verified but _ also _ if some additional constraint is verified , hence the name kinetically constrained .",
    "this choice of jump rates was originally devised in order to mimic the cage effect , that might be at the heart of the glassy behavior and the slow dynamics of glass forming liquids .",
    "indeed a molecule in a dense liquid is typically trapped in a cage created by surrounding particles ( see @xcite for a visual experimental example ) and this takes place in the regime of temperature and density at which the dynamics slows down dramatically .",
    "more specifically , kinetically constrained lattice gases are stochastic lattice gases with hard core exclusion , i.e. systems of particles on a lattice @xmath6 with the constraint that on each site there can be at most one particle .",
    "a configuration is therefore defined by giving for each site @xmath7 the occupation number @xmath8 , which represents an empty or occupied site respectively .",
    "the dynamics is given by a continuous time markov process on the configuration space @xmath9 which consists of a sequence of particle jumps .",
    "a particle at site @xmath10 attempts to jump to a different site @xmath11 with a fixed rate @xmath12 , which in general depends both on @xmath13 and on the configuration @xmath14 over the entire lattice .",
    "the discretized time version of the process is the following . at time @xmath15",
    "choose at random a particle , let @xmath10 be its position , and a site @xmath11 . at time @xmath16",
    ", the particle has jumped from @xmath10 to @xmath11 with probability @xmath17 , while with probability @xmath18 the configuration has remained unchanged . in other words , the probability measure at time t , @xmath19 , can be derived by the initial measure @xmath20 as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , the _ generator of the markov process _ , is the operator which acts on local functions @xmath23 as    @xmath24    where we defined    @xmath25    the simplest model is the simple symmetric exclusion process , ssep , in which @xmath26 for nearest neighbors @xmath13 , @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "therefore , only nearest neighbor jumps are allowed and there are no further kinetical constraints besides hard core .",
    "the definition _ kinetically constrained _ refers more properly to models in which jump rates impose additional requirements in order for the nearest neighbor move to be allowed",
    ". in other words , the rate @xmath12 can be zero for some choices of the configuration @xmath14 and the couple @xmath13 even if @xmath28 @xmath29 , thus preventing the jump of a particle from site @xmath10 to final empty site @xmath11 . from the above definition",
    "it is immediate to see that dynamics preserves the number of particles , i.e. the hyperplanes with fixed number",
    "n of particles @xmath30 are invariant under dynamics .",
    "moreover , in general the rates are chosen in order to satisfy detailed balance w.r.t . the uniform measure @xmath31 on such hyperplanes .",
    "in other words condition @xmath32 is satisfied for any choice of @xmath14 and the couple @xmath13 .",
    "this implies that the generator is reversible with respect to @xmath33 and therefore @xmath33 is stationary .",
    "@xmath22 is reversible with respect to @xmath34 if , for any functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 , equality @xmath37 holds . by a direct calculation it is possible to check",
    "that detailed balance implies reversibility with respect to @xmath33 , therefore the choice @xmath38 @xmath39 , implies @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "this , together with ( [ evolution ] ) implies that @xmath33 is invariant under time evolution . ] .",
    "note that @xmath33 is nothing else than canonical measure with zero hamiltonian , i.e. with this choice of the rules there are no static interactions beyond hard core and an equilibrium transition can not occur .",
    "however , a priori it is possible that a dynamical ergodic / non  ergodic transition occurs for some choices of the rules . to our knowledge , the kclg which have been considered so far do not display such transition ( see @xcite for the proof that an ergodic / non  ergodic transition does not occur in some highly cooperative kclg ) . on the other hand ,",
    "such transition has been proved to occur for a kinetically constrained spin model , namely north - east model @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss in the following possible forms of such transition rates .",
    "however , we emphasize since now that the degeneracy of the rates implies that @xmath33 is not the unique invariant measure , i.e. the system is not ergodic on @xmath42 and this will have several consequences on dynamics inducing a very different behavior with respect to rlg case .",
    "the ka model is a kinetically constrained lattice model with jump rates    @xmath43    namely a particle can move only if the hard core constraint is verified , as for the ssep , _ and _ only if both before and after the move it has no more than @xmath44 neighboring particles . if @xmath6 is an hypercubic @xmath45dimensional lattice @xmath44 will take values only from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ( different values of @xmath44 define different ka models ) .",
    "note that for @xmath48 the simple symmetric exclusion case with hamiltonian equal to zero is recovered . for future purposes",
    "it is useful to reformulate the rule in term of motion of vacancies . indeed , as can be easily verified , the above definition corresponds to _ vacancies _ moving only if the initial and final sites have at least @xmath49 neighboring vacancies , with @xmath50 the coordination number of the lattice .",
    "therefore the model is completely defined by the choice of the couple @xmath51 or equivalently @xmath52 .",
    "note that these rates satisfy detailed balance with respect to @xmath33 , i.e. uniform measure on the hyperplanes with fixed number of particles .",
    "however there exist configurations that are blocked under the dynamics , @xmath33 is not the unique invariant measure on the hyperplane and the process is never ergodic . for example , in the case @xmath53 @xmath54 with periodic boundary condition , a configuration which has a double row of sites completely filled belongs to a different ergodic component with respect to any other configuration which does not contain such structure .",
    "indeed , one can directly check that the particles belonging to the double row can never move .    on the infinite lattice @xmath55",
    "the model satisfies detailed balance with respect to the bernoulli product measure @xmath56 at any density @xmath57 .",
    "it is immediate to check that for @xmath58 the system is not ergodic at any density @xmath59 . indeed in this case",
    "all d  dimensional hypercubes of any size which are completely occupied by particles are blocked forever . on the other hand , in @xcite ,",
    "we have proved that for @xmath60 the model is ergodic at any density @xmath61 $ ] with probability one . as a by product of the ergodicity proof",
    "we have established the following property , which will be a key ingredient for the proof in section [ square ] .",
    "let @xmath62 be a positive number such that @xmath63 .",
    "for any fixed density @xmath64 there exists a finite length @xmath65 such that , by sorting at random with probability @xmath66 a configurations on a hypercubic d ",
    "dimensional lattice @xmath67 of linear size @xmath65 , with probability greater than @xmath62 this configuration is such that any particle exchange inside a finite box around the origin can be performed through a suitable path of allowed moves depends on the choice of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and the size of the box , we drop the dependence on these parameters for simplicity of notation . ] . furthermore @xmath62 can be taken arbitrary close to one taking a suitable ( large but finite ) @xmath65 . in the following",
    "we let a configuration with such property be a _ frameable configuration _ and refer to @xcite for the demonstration of above property and an explanation of the chosen name .",
    "consider a kinetically constrained model on the infinite lattice @xmath70 and start at time zero from the equilibrium distribution , so that the process will be stationary .",
    "then single out one particle , the tracer , and analyze its motion . in the density regime where the process is ergodic",
    "one can repeat the arguments in @xcite and show that under a diffusive rescaling the position of the tracer at time @xmath15 , @xmath71 , converges to a brownian motion with self diffusion matrix @xmath72 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is standard brownian motion and the self diffusion matrix @xmath72 is given by the variational formula @xcite ) one obtain that the matrix @xmath0 is positive , therefore the square root is a well defined function . ] : @xmath75 ^ 2\\right )   + \\!\\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{1}{\\{x , y\\}\\subset\\lambda } { x\\neq 0,y\\neq 0 } } \\mu_{\\rho,0}\\left(c_{x , y}(\\eta ) [ f(\\eta^{xy})-f(\\eta)]^2\\right ) \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{variational}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is a unit vector in @xmath77 , @xmath78 is euclidean scalar product , @xmath79 is the configuration obtained translating the configuration @xmath14 of @xmath11 , @xmath80 is the bernoulli measure at density @xmath57 conditioned to the existence of a particle in the origin and the infimum is over all real  valued local functions @xmath35 , i.e. functions which depend on a finite number of occupation variables . for spatially isotropic systems , as the one we will deal with , the self diffusion matrix is usually proportional to identity , the proportionality coefficient being the so  called _ self diffusion coefficient_. for future purposes it is useful to define the two sums in ( [ variational ] ) as @xmath81 and @xmath82    @xmath83 ^ 2\\right)\\label{d1}\\\\   d_2(\\rho , f)&=&\\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{1}{\\{x , y\\}\\subset\\lambda } { x\\neq 0,y\\neq 0 } } \\mu_{\\rho,0}\\left ( c_{x , y}(\\eta)[f(\\eta^{xy})-f(\\eta)]^2\\right ) \\label { d2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is immediate to notice that @xmath84 and @xmath85 at any density @xmath57 , and therefore @xmath86 .",
    "however , for the tagged particle process to be diffusive , @xmath0 should be strictly positive . for",
    "the rlg case in any dimension @xmath87 the result @xmath88 at any density @xmath64 holds . since the proof @xcite uses as a key ingredient the fact that jumps from occupied to neighboring empty sites",
    "are always allowed , it can not be trivially extended to kinetically constrained models .",
    "we emphasize that this is not only a technical difficulty . indeed , due to the presence of kinetic constraints , the physical mechanism behind the diffusion of the tagged particle may be rather different as we shall show in the next sections .    in the following section we will prove that @xmath88 at any @xmath64 for ka model on a triangular lattice . for this choice of the lattice there exist `` defects '' , namely clusters of two vacancies that can freely move through an otherwise totally filled lattice and such that the tagged particle can move whenever such `` defects '' passes by . therefore these defects play the same role of the vacancies for the rlg case and the above mentioned proof of diffusivity ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) ) can be generalized . in the following we sketch this result in some detail since it can be extended to other models with finite `` defects '' and",
    "it is useful to introduce the notation and the method before analyzing the more difficult case of ka model on hypercubic lattices .",
    "indeed , in this case it is not possible to construct finite cluster of vacancies that can freely move into an otherwise totally filled lattice and additional work is required to prove diffusivity . as explained in @xcite , in this case the mechanism behind diffusion",
    "is based on the existence of `` quasi ",
    "defects '' , namely cluster of vacancies which can move into typical regions of the system and allow the motion of a tagged particle ( via a particular path of elementary moves ) when they pass by .",
    "the size of such defects is density dependent and diverges for @xmath89 , which makes the motion _",
    "consider the ka model with @xmath54 on a triangular lattice @xmath6 represented in figure [ tria1 ] .",
    "more precisely , the set of sites in @xmath6 is the union of sites in a square lattice @xmath90 and in its dual @xmath91 , i.e. the lattice obtained by displacing @xmath90 of @xmath92 with @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , two sites @xmath95 are nearest neighbors if @xmath96 or @xmath97 or else @xmath98 . as already noticed , rates ( [ ka2 ] ) reformulated in terms of vacancies correspond to the rule that a vacancy can move only if the initial and final sites have at least @xmath69 neighboring vacancies , where @xmath54 in the case we are considering . in the triangular lattice two",
    "neighboring sites always share a common third neighbor .",
    "therefore any of two nearest neighbor vacancies can move to the common third neighbor .",
    "in other words a set of two neighboring vacancies , which we call `` a defect '' , can be freely moved into an otherwise totally filled lattice , as can be immediately checked ( see figure [ basic ] ) .",
    "there is a simple heuristic argument based on the independent motion of these defects that leads to the correct density dependence of the self - diffusion coefficient at high density .",
    "call @xmath99 the density of defects and @xmath100 the timescale on which defects move .",
    "the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath101 of a tagged particle is expected to be proportional to the inverse of the time @xmath102 on which each particle moves of one step . on the timescale",
    "@xmath100 the number of particles that have jumped is of the order @xmath103 where v is the total number of sites .",
    "thus we find @xmath104 as a consequence , at density close to one , we get @xmath105 . note that we have assumed that the size of the defects do not change , in particular do not diverge in the limit @xmath106 , otherwise the reasoning has to be changed slightly . since for the ka model on the triangular lattice we are focusing on the defects",
    "are formed by two vacancies we find , in the limit @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , hence , @xmath110 ( similarly in the ssep case a defect is just a vacancy and one gets @xmath111 ) .    in the following",
    "we will show how , using the existence of these defects , it is possible to generalize the proof of the rlg case @xcite and show that indeed @xmath112 . in principle",
    "our procedure is generalizable to all cases with defects having a size which does nt diverge in the limit @xmath107 . to obtain @xmath112",
    "we shall prove that when @xmath113 is close enough to one @xmath1 is bounded from above and below respectively by @xmath114 and @xmath115 where @xmath116 are two positive constants ( of course @xmath117 ) .",
    "the proof of the upper bound is very easy : it consists just in choosing an appropriate test function @xmath118 and evaluating the term in the parenthesis in the variational formula ( [ variational ] ) .",
    "indeed consider the test function @xmath119 , which for each configuration is equal to the occupation number in the origin . plugging it into ( [ variational ] ) we find a term which is proportional to the probability to have a vacancy on a fixed site and at least another vacancy close to it ( this is nothing else that the probability to have a defect ) .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a suitable positive constant .",
    "now let us focus on the lower bound which is more involved . instead of dealing directly with the variational formula ( [ variational ] ) , we define a proper auxiliary model and proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we establish that @xmath122 ; second , we prove that @xmath123 with @xmath124 a positive constant . more precisely , we will introduce an auxiliary process and prove that the diffusion coefficient in direction @xmath125 is positive , i.e. @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in an analogous way one can then introduce an auxiliary process to show the same inequalities in direction @xmath128 , which completes the proof of the positivity of the self diffusion matrix .",
    "let us introduce some notation .",
    "consider the following subsets of @xmath67    @xmath129    namely @xmath130 are the two couples of neighboring sites of @xmath10 represented in figure [ r ] .",
    "[ ] [ ] @xmath10 [ ] [ ] @xmath131 [ ] [ ] @xmath132     and @xmath132 . ]",
    "we next define @xmath133 as the configuration obtained from @xmath14 by exchanging the occupation numbers in @xmath134 with the corresponding ones in @xmath135 , namely    @xmath136    finally , we introduce the events    @xmath137    which contain configurations having the two neighboring sites in @xmath130 empty , namely configuration with a defect in @xmath130 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath10 the position of the tagged particle and define the auxiliary process as follows . at time",
    "@xmath138 the tagged particle is at the origin and there is a `` defect '' in a neighboring couple of sites , namely @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "( i.e. @xmath141 or @xmath142 ) .",
    "then the process evolves as follows    \\(i ) the tagged particles can jump from @xmath10 to @xmath143 .",
    "the rate of the jump is one if @xmath144 ( i.e. @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) ;    \\(ii ) the tagged particles can jump from @xmath10 to @xmath147 .",
    "the rate of the jump is one if @xmath148 ( i.e. @xmath149 and @xmath146 ) ;    \\(iii ) configuration @xmath14 is exchanged to @xmath133 ( i.e. the occupation variables of sites @xmath143 , @xmath150 are exchanged with the occupation variable in @xmath147 and @xmath151 , respectively ) .",
    "the rate of the exchange is one ;    \\(iv ) all other moves are not allowed .    with this definition of the rules it is immediate to check that , since the configuration at time zero is such that @xmath152 , at any subsequent time @xmath153 condition @xmath154 will hold .",
    "moreover , since the defect can be moved from @xmath131 to @xmath132 and viceversa ( move ( iii ) above ) , the jump of the tagged particle to any of the two neighbors in direction @xmath125 can always be performed via a sequence of at most two moves .",
    "therefore the self diffusion coefficient in direction @xmath125 is strictly greater than zero at any density @xmath64 , namely @xmath155 .",
    "this can be rigorously proved in the same way as for rlg ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us now turn to the second step , namely establishing inequality @xmath157 , with @xmath158 .",
    "since move ( iii ) for the auxiliary process is not allowed for ka , some work is required to establish such inequality .",
    "the basic idea is to show that all the moves allowed for the auxiliary process can be performed through a proper finite sequence of elementary nearest neighbors jumps which are allowed for the original model .",
    "if this is true then it is natural to expect that the above inequality among the diffusion coefficients can be rigorously established .",
    "let us outline the proof .",
    "consider the second term , @xmath159 , of the variational formula ( [ variational ] ) .",
    "the above choice of the rates yields for the auxiliary process    @xmath160    as already mentioned any couple of neighboring vacancies can be freely moved through the lattice using elementary moves allowed by ka , see figure [ basic ] . in particular , thanks to the fact that the @xmath14 which enters in ( [ variational2aux ] ) have a couple of vacancies either in the set @xmath131 or @xmath132 ( or both ) , by using the basic moves in figure [ basic ] it is possible to construct a path of elementary nearest neighbor exchanges which have unit rate for ka model and connect @xmath14 to @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , such path is independent on the configuration outside @xmath131 and @xmath132 . in other words , by recalling definition ( [ exchange ] ) and letting the exchange operator @xmath161 be    @xmath162    the following equivalence holds    @xmath163    where @xmath164 is the length of the above defined path and @xmath165 is the elementary exchange which constitute the j  th move of the path .",
    "therefore , term @xmath166 in ( [ variational2aux ] ) can be rewritten by a telescopic sum as    @xmath167    where we have defined @xmath168 as @xmath169 , @xmath170 .",
    "then , by using ( [ telescopic ] ) and cauchy  scharwz inequality we obtain    @xmath171    since the path @xmath168 has been chosen in order that the exchanges in the right hand side are all elementary exchanges allowed for ka process , i.e. with unit rate , we can rewrite the above inequality by introducing in the right hand side the corresponding jump rates    @xmath172    inserting the above inequality in ( [ variational2aux ] ) , using the change of variables @xmath173 and the invariance of equilibrium measure under exchange of occupation numbers yields , for any real  valued local function @xmath35 ,    @xmath174    where we let @xmath175 be the maximal number of times a single exchange has been used in the path . in other words ,",
    "let @xmath176 be the number of times operator @xmath177 appears in expression [ minimalpath ] , we let @xmath178 where the maximum is taken over all the couples of neighboring @xmath179 .",

    "therefore    @xmath183    with @xmath124 a strictly positive constant and @xmath184 , which is also strictly positive at any density @xmath64 . in particular , in the high density limit , @xmath185 ,",
    "hence , we finally get @xmath186 with @xmath187 a positive constant .",
    "in the following we analyze the @xmath54 ka model on a square lattice .",
    "this is a case in which it is impossible to identify defects with a density independent size that can freely move inside the lattice .",
    "thus , the key ingredient for the diffusivity proof discussed in the previous section does not hold .",
    "this is not a simple technical difficulty but it is deeply related to the fact that diffusion takes place in a different way in this case .",
    "as it has been found in @xcite by analytical and numerical arguments the diffusion takes place thanks to the cooperative motion of a number of vacancies that diverges approaching unit density .",
    "this leads to an extremely rapid decreasing of the self - diffusion coefficient that , however , remains positive until unit density .",
    "+ in the following we want to show how one can prove that indeed @xmath1 remains positive for @xmath188 .",
    "our procedure is very general and can be applied to the other highly cooperative ka models as well as to many other interacting lattice particle systems .",
    "note that in this case , at variance with what done in the previous section , we will not discuss the upper bound on @xmath1 . mainly because we do not expect that the lower bound we establish does give the right density dependence ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the strategy of the proof is similar to the one discussed in the previous section : we introduce a proper auxiliary process such that @xmath189 with @xmath158 and then we prove that @xmath190 .",
    "the key physical ingredient that allows us to find that such an auxiliary process exists is that ( @xcite and section [ kadefinition ] ) all the particle exchanges inside a finite box around the origin can be performed with a very high probability @xmath62 through a suitable path in configuration space that involves particles at most at distance @xmath65 from the origin . in this case",
    "the restricted configuration in the sublattice @xmath191 of size @xmath192 around the origin is called _ frameable _ ( see section [ kadefinition ] ) .",
    "furthermore @xmath62 can be chosen arbitrary close to one taking a suitably large @xmath65 .",
    "if this property is verified then it s possible to find an auxiliary process that maps onto a random walk in a random environment and has @xmath190 .",
    "let us explain the idea in more detail .",
    "consider a configuration on the infinite lattice @xmath193 sorted at random with bernoulli measure at density @xmath57 and focus on a sub - lattice @xmath191 of linear size @xmath65 .",
    "as recalled in section ( [ kadefinition ] ) , we know that the restriction of the configuration to @xmath191 is frameable with probability almost one",
    ". therefore in the initial configuration the tagged particle is with very high probability inside a frameable region of size @xmath192 .",
    "moreover , if one divides the infinite lattice in sub - lattices of linear size @xmath192 , there exists with unit probability a percolating cluster of sub - lattices such that the initial configuration restricted to each sub - lattice is frameable .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , if we define an auxiliary process such that : ( 1 ) the tagged particle can move if it is inside a frameable square , ( 2 ) during the dynamics frameable sublattices remain frameable and the tagged particle remains always inside the percolating cluster then we can reconstruct any move of such process through a finite sequence of moves allowed by ka ( indeed any nearest neighbor move in a frameable configuration of linear size @xmath192 can be performed through a sequence of elementary moves allowed by ka rules and the length of such path is at most of order @xmath194)and prove inequality @xmath195 . furthermore since in the auxiliary process the particle moves on a percolating giant cluster then @xmath190 .",
    "let us introduce some notation .",
    "consider the following subsets of @xmath193    @xmath196    @xmath130 are the eight possible couples of neighboring sites @xmath197 such that @xmath198 and @xmath199 or @xmath200 ( see figure [ rq ] ) , in other words one among @xmath11 and @xmath201 is neighboring site to @xmath10 and the couple does not contain @xmath10 ; @xmath202 are the four possible choices of three sites that , together with @xmath10 , form a two by two square ( see figure [ rq ] ) .    ]",
    "we next define @xmath203 , for @xmath204 as the configuration obtained from @xmath14 by exchanging the occupation numbers in @xmath205 with the corresponding ones in @xmath206 @xmath207 then , for @xmath208 , we introduce the events    @xmath209    i.e. configurations having all the sites of set @xmath202 empty and @xmath210 for @xmath211 , where    @xmath212    and @xmath213 is the set of squares in @xmath193 of linear size at most @xmath192 . here",

    "the move has rate one if @xmath229 and @xmath253 or @xmath231 and @xmath254 , zero otherwise ;    \\(ix ) all other moves are not allowed .    in the following",
    "we will show that the above choice of the rates is a suitable choice to perform the proof of diffusivity , since the auxiliary process has a positive diffusion coefficient and any move can be reconstructed by a finite sequence of elementary moves allowed by ka .",
    "consider an initial configuration such that the tagged particle is inside a frameable square of size @xmath192 and such that all the sites in at least one of the sets @xmath255 ( see figure [ rq ] ) are empty , where @xmath222 is the position of the tagged particle ( i.e. @xmath256 for some i ) .",
    "then , both conditions will hold at any subsequent time .",
    "indeed , moves ( i)(iv ) are such that the tagged particle remains always inside the empty two by two square . on the other hand , moves ( v)(viii )",
    "are devised in order that the only vacancies that are moved during the process are those which belong at time zero to this two by two square , therefore sublattices of size @xmath192 that are frameable at time zero remain frameable at later times are frameable also for @xmath257 at any t. ] .",
    "the fact that moves for the auxiliary process occur always inside frameable regions of size at most @xmath192 implies that any move can be performed through a finite sequence of elementary moves allowed by ka .",
    "indeed , by the properties of frameable configurations , any move inside a configuration of size @xmath192 can be performed by a sequence of order @xmath258 moves with positive rate for ka dynamics @xcite . by using path arguments analogous to those used in section [ triangular ] for the triangular case ,",
    "it is then possible to establish inequality @xmath259 , with @xmath124 positive",
    ". let us shortly recall how this argument works and emphasize an important difference occurring in this case . for the triangular case we have defined an auxiliary process such that any move of the latter can be performed by a finite path of at most @xmath164 nearest neighbor moves allowed for the considered model .",
    "such path does not depend on the choice of the configuration .",
    "then , we have rewritten each term of the variational formula ( [ variational ] ) of @xmath260 as a telescopic sum on the exchanges along this path .",
    "finally , by using cauchy schwartz inequality , the fact that each possible move is used at most twice in the path and by performing an exchange of variables , we concluded that @xmath261 with @xmath158 . in this case",
    "we can proceed analogously , with the length @xmath164 of the paths at most @xmath194 .",
    "however , the path now depends on the whole configuration .",
    "indeed the sequence of allowed moves that one has to do in order to perform a pair exchange depends on the position of the vacancies , see @xcite .",
    "this yields in the inequality among @xmath260 and @xmath0 an overall factor @xmath262 besides the factor due to @xmath263 .",
    "let us explain in some detail this statement .",
    "+ with a path argument analogous to the one done before , we rewrite each term in @xmath260 corresponding to the exchange of particles in @xmath130 , @xmath264 as a telescopic sum over allowed exchanges for ka , namely    @xmath265    where @xmath266 are the jump rate of ka model , @xmath267 is the path of allowed elementary moves which connects @xmath14 to @xmath203 and such that @xmath268 for a couple of nearest neighbors @xmath269 . to obtain above inequality we used cauchy schwartz inequality and the fact that @xmath270 .",
    "in order to obtain from left and right hand side the terms which appear in the variational formula ( [ variational ] ) for the auxiliary process and for ka , respectively , we should average inequality ( [ telescopic3ka ] ) over the bernoulli measure conditioned to have a particle in zero .",
    "as we already emphasized , the sequence @xmath271 of sites in which the exchange is done , depends on the positions of vacancies in configuration @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , if we do the change of variable @xmath173 in ( [ telescopic3ka ] ) and use the invariance of measure under exchange of variables , many different terms on the left can give rise to the same term on the right .",
    "actually , the crucial thing to know is the following . to each configuration @xmath14 for which the exchange is allowed by the auxiliary process ,",
    "associate the correspondent path @xmath272 in configuration space and any give exchange . ] .",
    "then , for each elementary nearest neighbor exchange @xmath273 , denote by @xmath274 the number of different configurations @xmath14 that use such exchange and let @xmath275 .",
    "therefore @xmath175 is the overall factor coming from possible overcounting of configuration when going from the mean of the left hand side of ( [ telescopic3ka ] ) to the terms in the variational formula ( [ variational ] ) for @xmath0 .",
    "physically @xmath175 takes into account the most severe dynamical bottleneck in phase space ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , since each path is composed of moves internal to the frameable region of size @xmath276 which contains the tagged particle , @xmath175 is for sure less or equal to the total number of configurations inside a square of size @xmath192 , namely inequality @xmath277 holds",
    ". therefore , we finally obtain , closely enough to unit density ,    @xmath278    where @xmath124 is a positive constant .",
    "the term @xmath279 comes from the condition that the configuration at time zero should have the tagged particle with three vacancies around and be inside a frameable square of size at most @xmath192 and @xmath260 is the diffusion coefficient of the auxiliary process subject to this condition .",
    "this ends the first part of the proof . in the following section",
    "we shall show that indeed @xmath190 .",
    "let us now prove that @xmath122 , i.e. that diffusivity holds for the auxiliary process . in this case , the mechanism which guarantees diffusivity is different from the one discussed in section [ triangular ] .",
    "analogously to the ka on a triangular lattice ( section [ triangular ] ) , the auxiliary process we have just introduced is such that if the tagged particle is at time zero in a two by two square of vacancies ( i.e. @xmath280 for some i ) and inside a larger frameable square of size at most @xmath192 , both conditions will be always fulfilled at later times .",
    "however , now it is not true that the tagged particle can always be moved in a chosen direction @xmath281 through a proper path . for example , if we want to move it in direction @xmath125 this is possible only if @xmath282 or @xmath283 . otherwise , if @xmath284 or @xmath285 , the move is allowed only if before one makes the exchange @xmath286 or @xmath287 , respectively .",
    "however these exchanges of rectangles ( which are the analogous of exchange @xmath288 for rlg ) are not always allowed .",
    "indeed ( see rules ( v)(viii ) ) they have positive rate only if in the initial configuration the rectangular regions @xmath289 , respectively @xmath290 , do not contain vacancies and are inside a frameable square of size at most @xmath192 .",
    "note that the rate of such exchanges ( i.e. the rate of the exchange @xmath286 and @xmath287 conditioned to the fact that @xmath284 or @xmath285 respectively ) does not depend on the configuration @xmath14 , but is fixed once for all by the choice of the initial configuration @xmath221 . in other words the choice of the initial configuration fixes the _ good _ rectangles that can be exchanged .",
    "this observation will allow us to map the motion of the two by two square of three vacancies plus tagged particle to a random walk in a random environment corresponding to the cluster of good rectangles .",
    "we emphasize that this cluster does not change during dynamics , therefore the randomness of the environment is _",
    "quenched_. note that the probability @xmath291 for a given rectangle to be good is greater than @xmath292 ( the probability that both the sites inside the rectangle are occupied ) multiplied for the probability that it is inside a frameable region of size at most @xmath192 which is almost one ( this is the key physical ingredient ) .",
    "therefore in the high density regime @xmath291 is well above the threshold of conventional site percolation .",
    "this implies that with unit probability the initial configuration has a percolating cluster of good rectangles . by using that above the percolation threshold random walk on random environment",
    "has a positive diffusion coefficient @xcite we will therefore obtain that the diffusion coefficient of the auxiliary process is strictly positive . in the following we will sketch the proof of the above argument in some detail .",
    "let @xmath293 be the initial configuration .",
    "let us define the following sequence of configurations @xmath294 for @xmath295    @xmath296    @xmath297    @xmath298    @xmath299    where @xmath300 is the position of the tagged particle in configuration @xmath294 ( we drop the dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath44 and @xmath164 to get a more readable notation ) .",
    "note that given @xmath294 and @xmath301 for a couple @xmath302 , using the above definitions one can reconstruct the whole sequence .",
    "+ let us define a markov process on @xmath193 with generator @xmath303 acting on functions @xmath304 as @xmath305 namely a two dimensional random walk with rates @xmath306 for the jump in direction @xmath307 .",
    "we can now chose these rates in order that @xmath308 for the auxiliary process .",
    "more precisely , we chose the rates in order that for any function @xmath309 the expectation value over the probability @xmath19 evoluted with the generator of the auxiliary process coincides with the expectation over the measure on @xmath310 generated by ( [ geng ] ) . by considering the dynamics of the auxiliary process and definition ( [ geng ] ) , one can directly check that the choice of @xmath306 which satisfies above requirement is the following    @xmath311    let us define also    @xmath312    and    @xmath313    > from definitions ( [ randomrates ] ) and ( [ randomrates2 ] ) it is immediate to check that @xmath314 . because the variational formula ( [ variational ] ) implies that the self diffusion coefficient is a monotonic increasing function of the jump rates we find that @xmath1 for the random walk process with rates @xmath306 is certainly larger than the one for the process with rates @xmath315 . by recalling definition",
    "( [ cb ] ) and results on crossover length , we know that for sufficiently high density the probability w.r.t . bernoulli measure of events    @xmath316 @xmath317 @xmath318 @xmath319 is almost one , and therefore greater then threshold probability for conventional percolation on the square lattice .",
    "hence , by using the result in @xcite which establishes a central limit theorem for random walk in random environment when bond probability is greater than percolation threshold we find that @xmath1 for the process with rates @xmath315 ( and therefore @xmath1 for the process with rates @xmath320 ) is strictly positive . whereas in @xcite it was analyzed only the case with independent bond probability .",
    "however we expect that their result can be generalized to our case .",
    "furthermore from the physical point of view there is no doubt that @xmath1 will be positive in our case of correlated site disorder whenever a giant cluster exists ( except at the critical point ) .",
    "] moreover , since when @xmath44 goes to @xmath321 ( @xmath164 to @xmath322 ) the first ( second ) coordinate of the tagged particle position increases at least of one unit , inequality    @xmath323    holds , where @xmath19 is the evoluted of initial measure @xmath80 under the auxiliary process and @xmath124 a positive constant .",
    "this allows us to conclude that @xmath122 at any @xmath64 which , together with inequality ( [ daux ] ) , implies @xmath88 for ka model .",
    "in this work we have presented a general procedure , focusing on the ka model as an example , that allows one to prove lower and upper bounds on interacting particle systems on a lattice in the case of vanishing rates .",
    "this is a generalization of the spohn s proof @xcite for rlg . in particular , focusing on ka @xmath54 model on a triangular lattice as an example , we show how to obtain the exact density dependence of @xmath1 in the high density limit for kclg with finite size defects ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "whereas for highly cooperative kclg , i.e. when the size of the defects diverges approaching unit density , our procedure allows to prove diffusivity , @xmath2 , at any density smaller than one as we have shown for the ka @xmath54 model on a square lattice . +",
    "as we have stressed previously our method is completely general and can be applied to general ( short - range ) interacting particle systems on a lattice , including systems with a non  trivial equilibrium measure as for example the statically constrained models introduced in @xcite . in order to be successful",
    ", it just needs one crucial key physical property .",
    "one has to know that , for a random equilibrium configuration , all the particle exchanges inside a finite box around a fixed site , say the origin , can be performed with a very high probability @xmath62 through a suitable path in configuration space ( allowed by the kinetic rules ) that involves particles at most at distance @xmath192 from the origin .",
    "furthermore one needs also that @xmath62 can be chosen arbitrary close to one taking a suitably large @xmath192 .",
    "+ this property is certainly valid if , given two equilibrium configurations taken at random inside a box of size @xmath324 , one can show that there exists with probability @xmath325 at least a path in configuration space , allowed by the kinetic rules , that connects the two configurations and that @xmath326 .",
    "note that is just equivalent to say that the system at hand is irreducible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "more correctly , in the thermodynamic limit one irreducible component @xmath327 covers all the configuration space , i.e. an equilibrium configuration taken at random belongs to @xmath327 with probability one .",
    "therefore our results , combined with the ones obtained for brownian interacting particle systems @xcite , strongly suggest that the only case in which a dynamical arrest ( at which @xmath1 vanishes at a finite temperature / chemical potential ) might happen is only when a irreducible - reducible transition takes place and that one has to identify the two types of transition .",
    "+ to our knowledge , none of the short - range interacting particle systems which have been considered so far ( on a lattice as well as in the continuum ) has been proved to display such reducibility transition in dimension larger than one .",
    "finally , we want to stress again that the non - vanishing of the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath1 does not imply that the structural relaxation time scale @xmath328 can not diverge .",
    "in particular , as discussed previously , at a second order phase transition the structural relaxation time scale diverges whereas the self - diffusion coefficient stays finite .",
    "thus , the decoupling between @xmath1 and @xmath329 is _ a necessary condition for the existence of an ideal glass transition _ taking place at finite temperature and chemical potential . in experiments on fragile liquids @xcite a decoupling",
    "is indeed observed between @xmath1 and @xmath329 ( more correctly between @xmath1 and the viscosity @xmath14 ) but not as strong as one would have very close to a phase transition , i.e. @xmath330 .",
