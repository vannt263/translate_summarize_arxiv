    "by using the fubini - tonelli theorem , @xmath53 to simplify this series , we observe that each @xmath54 can be written as @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 in a unique way , leading to the identity @xmath58 since @xmath52 , the left - hand side is easily expressed in terms of the zeta function : @xmath59 which ends the proof of .",

    "our strategy is to show that the function @xmath60 defined for all @xmath49 with @xmath50 by @xmath61 has a holomorphic continuation to the domain @xmath62 .",
    "this fact would indeed prevent @xmath63 from having zeros with real part larger than @xmath64 , since such zeros would correspond to poles of @xmath60 in the same region .",
    "the celebrated functional equation ( theorem 2.1 in @xcite ) satisfied by @xmath63 shows that its zeros in the critical strip @xmath65 are symmetrically distributed with respect to the vertical line @xmath66 .",
    "hence , the function @xmath63 would not vanish in the region @xmath67 either .",
    "the holomorphic continuation is obtained by an integral representation of @xmath60 based on formula   in the lemma .",
    "namely , for all @xmath49 with @xmath50 , @xmath68 the estimate for @xmath46 in the neighbourhood of @xmath36 implies that the first integral defines a holomorphic function of @xmath49 in the domain @xmath69 .",

    "recall here that the zeta function has a unique holomorphic continuation to @xmath75 , and that @xmath76 is a simple pole with residue @xmath76 . assuming that riemann s hypothesis holds , the only pole of the function @xmath71 in the region @xmath77 lies at @xmath78 with residue @xmath79 .",
    "we can therefore apply the residue theorem to show that @xmath80 taking @xmath81 in the mellin inversion formula above , we see that the integral on @xmath82 $ ] tends to @xmath46 as @xmath83 tends to @xmath15 . in order to deal with the other three integrals",

    "<S> an equivalence is proven between the riemann hypothesis and the speed of convergence to @xmath0 of the probability that two independent random variables following the same geometric distribution are coprime integers , when the parameter of the distribution goes to 0 .    </S>",
    "<S> what is the probability that two random integers are coprime ? </S>",
    "<S> since there is no uniform probability distribution on @xmath1 , this question must be made more precise . before going into probabilistic considerations </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to remind a seminal result of dirichlet  @xcite : the set @xmath2 of ordered pairs of coprime integers has an asymptotic density in @xmath3 which is equal to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the proof is not trivial and can be found in the book of hardy and wright ( @xcite , theorem  332 ) , but if one admits the existence of a density @xmath5 , its value can be easily obtained . indeed , the set @xmath3 is the disjoint union of @xmath2 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ,  which have respective density @xmath5 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ,  , hence @xmath10    a natural choice for picking two integers at random is to draw two random variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 independently according to the uniform distribution on @xmath13 and let @xmath14 goes to @xmath15 . in this case , denoting by @xmath16 the classical euler totient function , the probability that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are coprime equals @xmath17 as was shown by mertens @xcite in 1874 . </S>",
    "<S> the sharpest error term in this problem up to now was obtained in 1963 by walfisz  @xcite who replaced the @xmath18 term of mertens by @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> one can quickly realize that the error term can not boil down to @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the passage from @xmath14 to @xmath21 perturbates the average by a term of order @xmath22 . a striking result by montgomery  @xcite shows that the fluctuations are actually at least of order @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , kaczorowski and wiertelak considered in @xcite a smoothing of the sequence   above which corresponds to another family of probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> namely , for a given @xmath14 , the former uniform distribution on @xmath24 is replaced by the probability distribution putting a weight @xmath25 to the couple @xmath26 for all integers @xmath27 satisfying @xmath28 , up to a normalization factor . </S>",

    "<S> let @xmath33 be two independent random variables following the geometric distribution of parameter @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the riemann hypothesis holds if and only if , for all @xmath34 , as @xmath35 goes to @xmath36 , @xmath37 = \\frac{6}{\\pi^2 } + \\frac{6}{\\pi^2}\\beta + o(\\beta^{\\frac32-\\epsilon}).\\ ] ]    before we start with the proof , let us make a comment . </S>",
    "<S> the  smoothing \" we have chosen here is stronger than the smoothing of @xcite we described above . </S>",
    "<S> however , one could think about an even stronger one , corresponding to independent variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 both following the zeta distribution of parameter @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39={\\mathbf p}[y = n]=\\frac1{\\zeta(\\alpha)}\\frac1{n^\\alpha}.\\ ] ] in this case , @xmath40 is distributed according to the zeta distribution of parameter @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this explicit example shows that a too strong smoothing erases all oscillations of the probability of coprimality and makes the dependence on the localization of the zeroes of the zeta function vanish .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we turn to the proof of the theorem . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by expressing the probability that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are coprime as a function of  @xmath35 : @xmath42 = \\sum_{(x , y ) \\in \\mathcal p } { \\mathbf p}[x = x , y = y ] = ( e^{\\beta}-1)^2 \\sum_{(x , y ) \\in \\mathcal p } e^{-\\beta(x+y)}.\\ ] ] we see therefore that the function @xmath43 defined for all @xmath44 by @xmath45 plays a key role in the analysis of this probability . in particular , condition   is equivalent to the following expansion of @xmath46 as @xmath35 goes to @xmath36 : @xmath47 in the sequel , we will work with instead of . </S>"
