    "entanglement plays an important role in quantum information processing @xcite . for example , bipartite entangled states provide some novel ways for quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum dense coding @xcite .",
    "multipartite entangled states have many important applications in quantum computation and quantum communication .",
    "it provides the superpower of quantum computer @xcite and the resource for quantum error correction codes @xcite .",
    "some important branches of quantum communication require multipartite entangled states to set up the quantum channel , such as controlled teleportation @xcite , quantum secret sharing @xcite and quantum state sharing @xcite .    in experiment ,",
    "the implement of quantum communication depends on the transmission of quantum systems .",
    "however , the noise in quantum channel will degrade the entanglement of the quantum system transmitted , even make it in a mixed state , which will decrease the fidelity of quantum teleportation or make quantum communication insecure . in this time",
    ", the parties of quantum communication usually exploit entanglement purification @xcite or entanglement concentration @xcite to obtain some maximally entangled states from a less - entanglement ensemble .",
    "entanglement purification is used to increase the entanglement of quantum systems in a mixed state , while entanglement concentration is only used to obtain some maximally entangled states from a set of pure entangled quantum systems .",
    "the former is more general than the latter in a practical quantum communication . by far ,",
    "entanglement purification has been studied not only for bipartite entangled quantum systems @xcite but also for multipartite entangled quantum systems @xcite . as multipartite entanglement purification is far more difficult than that for two - particle bell states ,",
    "there are only serval multipartite entanglement purification schemes @xcite , including that for high - dimensional quantum systems .    in 1998 , murao et al .",
    "@xcite presented a multipartite entanglement purification protocol for quantum systems in a greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state with controlled - not ( cnot ) gates and local hadamard transformations .",
    "their protocol has been generalized to high - dimensional multipartite quantum systems by cheong et al .",
    "@xcite in 2007 . in the latter @xcite , they use some generalized xor gates in high - dimensional systems , instead of the common cnot gates in two - dimensional systems , and the hadamard transformation is substituted by the quantum fourier transformation .",
    "it has been shown that with only single photon sources and linear optical elements , the maximal probability for achieving the cnot gate is 3/4 @xcite .",
    "so the cnot gate based on linear optics is beyond the reach of current technology .",
    "these obstacles make the multipartite entanglement purification protocols @xcite be hard to realize at present .",
    "cross - kerr nonlinearity provides a good tool to complete a parity - check measurement @xcite . with quantum language ,",
    "the cross - kerr nonlinearities can be described with the hamiltonian as follows @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the creation operations , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the annihilation operations .",
    "@xmath5 is the coupling strength of the nonlinearity , which is decided by the property of material . for a quantum signal in a fock state with the form of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "denote that there are no photon and one photon , respectively , in this state , and @xmath9 ) and a coherent probe beam in the state @xmath10 , after the interaction with the cross - kerr nonlinear medium the whole system evolves as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the interaction time .",
    "it is shown that the coherent beam picks up a phase shift proportional to the number of the photons in the fock state .    in this paper",
    ", we present a feasible scheme for multipartite entanglement purification of quantum systems in a ghz state by constructing nondestructive quantum nondemolition detectors ( qnd ) with cross - kerr nonlinearities . the task of multipartite entanglement purification can be completed with two steps which can be iterated perfectly .",
    "the first one is to purify the bit - flipping errors in multipartite quantum systems , and the second one is to purify their phase - flipping errors",
    ". this protocol does not require the cnot gate based on linear optics and sophisticated single - photon detectors , which makes it more feasible in practical applications .",
    "moreover , it has the same yield as that with cnot gates but reduces a large number of quantum resources in principle .",
    "the principle of our nondestructive quantum nondemolition detector ( qnd ) is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it is composed of two cress - kerr nonlinearities ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , four polarization beam splitters ( pbss ) , a coherent beam @xmath16 , and an x homodyne measurement . @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 represent the up spatial mode and the down spatial mode , respectively .",
    "each polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) is used to pass through the horizontal polarization photons @xmath19 and reflect the vertical polarization photons @xmath20 .",
    "the cross - kerr nonlinearity will make the coherent beam @xmath21 pick up a phase shift @xmath22 if there is a photon in the mode .",
    "the probe beam @xmath21 will pick up a phase shift @xmath22 if the state of the two photons injected into the two spatial modes @xmath17 and @xmath18 is @xmath23 or @xmath24 ; otherwise it picks up a phase shift @xmath25 ( for @xmath26 ) or @xmath27 ( for @xmath28 ) .",
    "that is , when the parity of the two photons is even , the coherent beam @xmath29 will pick up a phase shift @xmath22 ; otherwise it will pick up @xmath25 or @xmath27 .",
    "each party of quantum communication can determine the parity of his two photons with an x homodyne measurement . with this qnd , we can distinguish superpositions and mixtures of @xmath23 and @xmath24 from @xmath28 and @xmath26 .",
    "a multipartite ghz state for spin 1/2 systems can be written as @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the horizontal polarization state and the vertical polarization one , respectively .",
    "they are the two eigenvectors of the basis @xmath32 . in the following ,",
    "we first use three - particle ghz - state systems as an example for demonstrating the principle of our multipartite entanglement purification scheme and then discuss the case for @xmath33-particle systems in a ghz state .",
    "this scheme includes two steps : one for the bit - flipping error correction and the other for phase - flipping error correction . as this scheme works with quantum nondemolition detectors , instead of cnot gates ,",
    "we denote it qnd scheme .",

    "suppose that the original ghz state transmitted among the three parties is @xmath37 .",
    "if a bit - flipping error takes place on the particle in this ghz state after it is transmitted in a noisy channel , the three - particle system is in the state @xmath38 .",
    "we label that a bit - flipping error occurs on the first particle .",
    "if @xmath39 becomes @xmath40 , there is a phase - flipping error .",
    "sometimes , both a bit - flipping error and a phase - flipping error will take place on a three - particle quantum system transmitted in a noisy channel .",
    "the task for purifying three - particle entangled systems requires to correct both bit - flipping errors and phase - flipping errors on the quantum systems .",
    "suppose that alice , bob and charlie share an ensemble @xmath41 after the transmission of particles , i.e. , @xmath42 it means that there is a bit - flipping error on the quantum system with a probability of @xmath43 .",
    "here @xmath44 is the fidelity of the quantum systems transmitted . for correcting this error ,",
    "the three parties divide their quantum systems in the ensemble @xmath41 into many groups and each groups is composed of a pair of three - photon quantum systems , same as the first multipartite entanglement purification protocol by murao et al .",
    "@xcite in 1998 .",
    "we label each group with @xmath45 ( the two three - photon quantum systems @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",

    ", alice takes her two photons @xmath62 to pass through the setup shown in fig.2 .",
    "the photon @xmath63 entrances the up spatial mode and the photon @xmath64 entrances the down spatial mode .",

    "after the qnds , the three parties compare the parity of their photons .",
    "they only keep the groups for which all the three parties get an even parity . after these operations ,",
    "the quantum systems are in a new mixed state which is composed of the two states @xmath65 and @xmath66 as the two cross - combinations @xmath57 and @xmath58 never lead all the three parties to have the same parity .    after the rotation @xmath48 on each photon in the down spatial mode",

    "if their outcome is @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 or @xmath84 , they need only to flip the phase of the quantum systems kept and get the same result above .",
    "this task can be accomplished with a @xmath85 rotation on a photon in each three - photon quantum system . in detail",
    ", one of the three parties let his photon pass through a half - wave plate whose orientation is 90@xmath68 .    in the process above",
    ", each party chooses the phase shift @xmath22 for purification and gets the even parity @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",

    "the two photons of each party are in the state @xmath28 or @xmath26 , which leads to a phase shift @xmath27 or @xmath25 , respectively . these photons are discarded in the process above . in this way",
    ", the yield of this scheme is half of the original protocol proposed by murao _",
    "@xcite with cnot gates .",
    "however , if we choose a proper material for the qnd and make @xmath88 , we can not distinguish the phase shift @xmath27 and @xmath25 . in this time , the three parties can also keep their photons when they all get an odd parity .",
    "the state of the six photons becomes @xmath65 and @xmath89 . with a bit - flipping operation on each photon in the quantum system @xmath47",
    ", we get the same result as that with an even parity , which will double the yield .    for correcting the bit - flipping errors in multipartite entangled quantum systems",
    ", we can follow the same step of that for the three - particle ghz - state systems .",
    "we should only increase the number of the qnd equipments .",
    "for instance , for @xmath33-particle quantum systems whose original states are @xmath90 if a bit - flipping error occurs on the first particle , the @xmath33 parties chooses the same phase shift @xmath22 after their qnds and the state of a group of the quantum systems kept ( two ghz - state quantum systems ) becomes @xmath65 and @xmath89 . after a @xmath67 rotation on each photon in the second @xmath33-particle quantum system , eq.([correctn",

    "those on the other particles can also be corrected in the same way and one will get the same result above easily . that is , they can correct the bit - flipping errors in the state @xmath97 , here @xmath98      a phase - flipping error can not be corrected directly , different from a bit - flipping error , but it can be transformed into a bit - flipping error with h operations . with a h operation on each photon , the states shown in eq .",
    "( [ ghzstate ] ) are transformed into the following ones @xmath99    from eq.([phaseflipstate ] ) , one can see that the transformation between phase - flipping errors and bit - flipping errors in three - particle ghz states is more complex than that in bell states @xcite .",
    "we can not use the equipment shown in fig.2 to purify the states in eq.([phaseflipstate ] ) directly .",
    "that is , we can not exploit simply h operations to complete the transformation between phase - flipping errors and bit - flipping errors in three - particle ghz states perfectly , different from bell states .",

    ", they will get a new mixed entangled state with the fidelity of @xmath94 , same as that for bit - flipping error correction .",
    "in essence , in the process of purifying the phase - flipping error in the quantum systems , the parties of quantum communication first transform the phase - flipping errors into the bit - flipping errors and then correct them by comparing their parities . although the transformation on multi - particle ghz states make them more complex than bell states , the principles of the bit - flipping error correction and the phase - flipping error correction for multi - particle ghz states with parity checks are similar to those for bell states @xcite .",
    "the difference is just that bell states are more symmetrical than multi - particle ghz states under a hadamard transformation on each particle , which makes the entanglement purification of bell states easier than that of multi - particle ghz states .",
    "same as the bit - flipping error correction , the parties can also exploit proper qnds to improve their yield .",
    "so far , there are mainly three types of principles for the entanglement purification of two - photon bell states .",
    "one is based on cnot gates , which is the pioneer for entanglement purification .",
    "the second one is based on pbss , which is more feasible than the first one at present if it is used to improve partially the entanglement of the entangled quantum systems transmitted although its yield is in principle half of that with cnot gates .",
    "the third type is based on parity checks with cross - kerr nonlinearities .",
    "it is more feasible than the first type and has the same yield as the latter .",
    "we will show that these differences exist for the entanglement purification of multi - particle ghz states yet .",
    "the principle of the entanglement purification of multipartite entangled quantum systems with pbss is similar to that with qnds discussed above .",
    "we call it mpbs protocol .",
    "it also contains two steps : a bit - flipping error correction ( @xmath126 ) and a phase - flipping error correction ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "we describe the first step with an example of purifying an ensemble @xmath41 shown in eq .",
    "( [ ensemblerho ] ) and the second step with @xmath128 shown in eq .",
    "( [ ensemblerho2 ] ) below .",
    "the multipartite entanglement purification for other cases are the same as that for an ensemble @xmath41 with or without a little modification .",
    "the principle of the bit - flipping error correction on three - particle ghz states with pbss is shown in fig.4 .",
    "each party of quantum communication first lets his two photons coming from two quantum systems ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) pass through the setup shown in fig.4 from the two spatial modes , respectively , and then they pick up the events in which there is one and only one photon in each spatial mode ( call it a six - mode event ) , similar to the four - mode events in ref.@xcite .",
    "the quantum systems kept are in the mixture of the state @xmath65 and @xmath66 , as same as the case in which all the three parties get an even parity in the entanglement purification of the bit - flipping errors with qnds in sec . [ bfec ] . in this way",
    ", the three parties can get a new ensemble of the fidelity of @xmath129 with some single - photon measurements and unitary operations , same as that with qnds .",
    "the phase - flipping error correction can also be accomplished with the setup shown in fig.5 by picking up only the six - mode events .",
    "the other processes are same as those with qnds except for exploiting sophisticated single - photon detectors to distinguish the six - mode events from others .",
    "in our scheme , we detail the multipartite entanglement purification with two steps : one is the bit - flipping error correction and the other is the phase - flipping error correction . when entangled qubits are transmitted in a practical channel , it is possible to take place both a bit - flipping error and a phase - flipping error on qubits .",
    "a simple example is called the `` werner - type '' state @xcite , i.e , @xmath130 its fidelity is @xmath131 if we want to purify this `` werner - type '' state for obtaining the maximally entangled state @xmath132 , the bit - flipping error correction @xmath133 and the phase - flipping error correction @xmath114 are both needed . in the murao s protocol @xcite , they use @xmath134 to purify this mixed state .",
    "that is , the whole process for purification should be @xmath135 .",
    "they found that the @xmath134 protocol is not optimal for two - particle quantum systems , so it may be not optimal for the purification of multipartite entangled systems . in our protocol , we do not use the @xmath134 process , the order of @xmath133 and @xmath114 is arbitrary .",
    "however , we do not know which order is the optimal one .",
    "the purification of a `` werner - type '' state is more complicated than that with a single error correction , a bit - flipping error or a phase - flipping one .",
    "we can not get a deterministic expression for describing the iteration of the fidelity of ensembles kept like those in refs .",
    "it should be studied with some numerical methods according to the noise of the channel .    in the mpbs protocol , the parties only keep the events in which each spatial mode has one and only one photon , which requires each party to possess at least a sophisticated single - photon detector . at present , sophisticated single - photon detectors are not feasible . however , cross - kerr nonlinearities provide a good way for the parity check of the polarization states of two photons .",
    "this feature can be used to construct a qnd for entanglement purification of multipartite quantum systems . in our qnd protocol ,",
    "the qnd acts as not only the role of a cnot gate but also that of a photon - number detector , which makes the process for entanglement purification can be iterated perfectly .",
    "as it dose not require a cnot gate with linear optical elements and sophisticated single - photon detectors , this protocol is more convenient than the mpbs protocol in practical applications .",
    "certainly , cross - kerr nonlinear can be used to construct a cnot gate @xcite . with cnot gates ,",
    "multipartite entanglement purification can be completed with the murao s protocol @xcite .",
    "in fact , parity check is enough for entanglement purification @xcite and it requires less quantum resources largely , compared with cnot gates @xcite . in our scheme ,",
    "we use cross - kerr nonlinear to construct a qnd which acts as the role of parity check and photon number detector .",
    "one can also exploit other qnds @xcite to accomplish these tasks .",
    "same as all existing multipartite entanglement purification protocols @xcite ( as well as the entanglement purification protocols for two - particle systems @xcite ) , our scheme requires the parties possess the capability of storing the entangled photons in principle for improving the fidelity of multipartite ghz - state quantum systems . at present , storing a quantum state for a long time is not easy .",
    "the parties can exploit optical delays to complete the task of storing a quantum state for a short time . on the other hand",
    ", our scheme requires some hadamard gates on photons , same as the first multipartite entanglement purification protocol by murao et al .",
    "of course , the task is in principle not difficult to be accomplished with a half - wave plate whose orientation is 22.5@xmath68 .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a multipartite entanglement purification protocol for quantum systems in a ghz state .",
    "the task of entanglement purification can be accomplished with two steps .",
    "the first step is to decrease the rate of bit - flipping errors and the other is used for phase - flipping errors . in our protocol , we use a qnd to check the parity of the polarization states of two photons .",
    "each qnd detector acts as the role of both a cnot gate and a photon - number detector , which makes this protocol feasible for the iteration of purification . with a weak cross - kerr medium",
    ", the parties of quantum communication can keep the events in which they all get an even parity for a pair of multipartite entangled quantum systems . in this time",
    ", this protocol has the same yield as that with pbss and sophisticated single - photon detectors .",
    "if the parties can choose a proper cross - kerr nonlinear medium and a strong coherent beam , they can also exploit the events in which they all get an odd parity . with this modification ,",
    "this protocol has the same yield as that with cnot gates .",
    "compared with the murao s protocol @xcite , this protocol provides a practical way to realize entanglement purification of multipartite entangled quantum systems which are very useful in a long - distance quantum communication .",
