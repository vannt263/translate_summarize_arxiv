    "consider an infinite - server queue modulated by a finite - state irreducible continuous - time markov chain @xmath2 : when the so - called _ background process _",
    "@xmath2 is in state @xmath3 , jobs arrive according to a poisson process with rate @xmath4 , while the departure rate is @xmath5 .",
    "these markov - modulated infinite - server queues have attracted some attention during the past decades ; see e.g.  the early contributions @xcite and later @xcite .",
    "importantly , considerably fewer results are available for this model than for the corresponding _ single_-server queue .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that , despite the system s simple structure , the markov - modulated infinite - server queue hardly allows any explicit analysis : whereas the markov - modulated single - server queue has a matrix - geometric stationary distribution , no such result applies to its infinite - server counterpart .",
    "the results obtained so far are implicit , in that they are in terms of partial differential equations characterizing the probability generating functions related to the system s transient behavior , and recursions for the corresponding moments ( where in each step of the recursion a system of non - homogeneous ordinary differential equations needs to be solved ) .",
    "the markov - modulated infinite - server queue can be applied in various domains , ranging from biology to the performance analysis of particular communication networks . in the present paper",
    "the focus lies on the latter application , where the model with an infinite number of servers typically serves as a proxy for its counterpart with a large but finite number of servers .",
    "the markov modulation of the arrival rates and service rates facilitates the modeling of some sort of ?",
    "burstiness ? ; although the concept of markov modulation has been around for a few decades , it still spurs a considerable amount of research effort @xcite .",
    "for instance , the model can be used to describe the fluctuations in the users activity level ( where each user alternates between transmitting data or being silent ) .",
    "also , e.g.  in a wireless setting , the modulation of the service rate can represent channel conditions that vary over time . in the context of communication networks , a particularly relevant feature concerns _",
    "rare events_. more specifically , a high activity level corresponds to congestion , and therefore the system should be designed such that such high activity levels occur relatively infrequently .",
    "given that , as argued above , explicit analysis is hardly possible , recent research efforts have focused on the exploration of various limiting regimes . in the first place , significant progress has been made in terms of the derivation of ( functional ) central limit theorems under specific parameter scalings . when inflating the arrival rates by a factor @xmath0 , and speeding up the background process by a factor @xmath6 ( for some @xmath7 ) , in e.g.   @xcite it has been proven that the ( transient as well as stationary ) number of jobs present in the system is , after centering and normalizing , asymptotically normally distributed .",
    "an interesting dichotomy was identified , in that the regimes @xmath8 and @xmath9 lead to qualitatively different asymptotics .",
    "also the large - deviations regime has been explored , resulting in so - called _ logarithmic asymptotics _ @xcite . in these papers",
    "the arrival rates are scaled by a factor @xmath0 and the background process is either left unchanged or accelerated by a factor @xmath10 . with @xmath11 the number of jobs present at time @xmath12 in the resulting system ,",
    "these papers determine the limit @xmath13 as well as the corresponding limit for @xmath11 s steady - state counterpart @xmath14 .",
    "it is observed that these asymptotics are inherently imprecise , as they essentially just entail that @xmath15 for some _ unknown _ subexponential function @xmath16 ; we only know that @xmath16 has the property that , as @xmath17 , @xmath18 observe that ( [ subex ] ) still leaves a substantial amount of freedom : @xmath16 could be for instance a constant , but also any polynomial function of @xmath0 , or even ` big functions ' of the type @xmath19 we conclude that logarithmic asymptotics of the type ( [ logas ] ) typically provide valuable insight into the system s rare - event behavior , but that they may be too inaccurate to be used for performance evaluation purposes .",
    "this shows that there is a clear need for more precise asymptotic results .    the main contribution of the present paper is to improve the logarithmic asymptotics ( [ logas ] ) to so - called _ exact _ asymptotics : we identify an explicit function @xmath20 such that , as @xmath17 , @xmath21 as it turns out , this @xmath22 is the product of the exponential term identified above ( @xmath23 ) , a polynomial term ( which is typically of the form @xmath24 , for some @xmath25 ) , and a constant .",
    "the proof of this property consists of two steps , and relies on the property that @xmath11 obeys a poisson distribution with random parameter ( as was observed in e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "* in the first step a system of partial differential equations is set up for the distribution of this poisson parameter .",
    "* in the second step , this is combined with ( a uniform version ) of the classical result by bahadur and rao @xcite on the exact tail asymptotics of sample means of i.i.d .",
    "random variables , so as to obtain the exact asymptotics of the tail probability of our interest .",
    "_ model and notation .",
    "_ as mentioned above , @xmath4 is the ( poissonian ) arrival rate when the background process is in state @xmath26 .",
    "we let @xmath27 be the ( @xmath28 ) transition rate matrix of the ( irreducible ) background process @xmath2 , with @xmath29 denoting the corresponding invariant probability measure ( which is a @xmath30-dimensional vector @xmath29 ) .",
    "the entries of @xmath31 are non - negative , except for those on the diagonal ; the row - sums are assumed to be @xmath32 , where we define @xmath33 .",
    "concerning the departure process , two models are considered . in the first ,",
    "referred to as model  i , each job present is experiencing a departure rate @xmath5 when @xmath2 is in state @xmath26 ; as a consequence , this hazard rate may change during the job s sojourn time ( that is , when the background process makes a transition ) . in the second , model  ii",
    ", the crucial difference is that the job s sojourn time is sampled upon arrival : when the background process is then in state @xmath26 , it has an exponential distribution with mean @xmath34 .",
    "the evident independence assumptions are imposed .",

    "note that the above approach adequately deals with the randomness due to effect ( ii )  that is , we do not need to sample the poisson random variable , but we use computations instead .    the question that is left concerns the rarity which is a consequence of @xmath40 attaining a rare value . in the proofs",
    "we have seen that overflow is most likely caused by @xmath40 attaining a value ` close to ' its maximal value @xmath50 , which only happens when the jump epochs are close to those of some maximizing path ( that was explicitly determined in @xcite and @xcite for models i and ii , respectively ) .",

    "the idea is now to estimate the quantities @xmath286 separately , and to add the resulting estimates up .",
    "the first of these quantities is estimated under the actual measure @xmath287 , whereas for the second ( which contains the rare event of @xmath40 being close to @xmath50 ) we use importance sampling . in more detail :    * the quantity @xmath288 is estimated by performing @xmath289 runs : @xmath290 with the @xmath266 sampled under @xmath291if",
